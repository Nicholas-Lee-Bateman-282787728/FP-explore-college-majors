2246985,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Here we have Michael Radford and Al Pacino up against the sticky question of what to do with Merchant's blatant anti-Semitism.  Radford tries a prologue laying out the societal context and directs the play as close to a tragedy, though obviously no one dies and 17th century audiences probably thought it a comedy.  Is he trying to frame Shakespeare as a creature of his culture though not an active anti-Semite?  Maybe.

Regardless, if reading the prologue didn't make the point, the movie quickly shows Antonio spitting on Shylock. The memory of this act and other accumulated slights drives Shylock's fervid insistence in extracting the pound of flesh when Antonio is unable to repay the contracted debt.  Al Pacino is outstanding; he disappears into Shylock's sadness and bitterness, creating a character at once loathsome in his determination to win his bond and sympathetic for the loss of his daughter and the abuse to which he is subjected.  As distasteful as Shylock's stubborn insistence that Antonio die is the glee of Portia, the court, and the crowd when in disguise she turns the judgment on Shylock and he winds up stripped on all he values.  Emotionally squirming in my seat, it was hard to avoid concluding that Shakespeare was relishing the humiliation that he wrote for the Jew.

One side effect of Radford's attempt to come to grips with the probably impossible task of what to make of Shylock and what Shakespeare intended with the character is that all else in this production pales.  Portia is compelling in court and witty in other scenes, but all the other characters, though uniformly well-acted, feel like props in place to move the plot along to the courtroom climax. Scenes of Venice are detailed and realistic, adding to the sensation of watching a richly well-done movie of an unsatisfying and morally ambiguous (at best) work.",1108080000,,1858,4.967741935483871
2246986,4,B0007WRT4Q,"This one is up there with Branauh's(sp?) Henry V and Hamlet, somewhat better than the World War II version of Richard III. I'm not giving it a 5 star rating only because some of the old english script was run a bit too fast in the first third of the movie. Translation: 16th century thee's and thou's came on a bit too fast to understand without pain.",1107820800,,351,4.253731343283582
2246987,4,B0007WRT4Q,"I approached this movie with some trepidation, mainly owing to the presence of Al Pacino as Shylock. The only Shakespeare I had seen him attempt was his lead in Richard III. I was less than impressed by his acting in that one. I'm also always a little queasy about seeing screen attempts at encapsulating a three hour Shakespeare play in a two hour movie.

While I wasn't exactly delighted at the outcome of this attempt, there is a lot to recommend, thanks to some sure handed British directing and acting. And Pacino underplays a role for a change (for the most part) and he handled his line readings with aplomb.

The problem with the script (and it is, along with MEASURE FOR MEASURE and THE WINTERS TALE, one of Shakespeare's ""problem"" plays to begin with, in that it is morally ambiguous) is the obvious anti-semitism surrounding the moneylender Shylock. The film actually opens with a kind of disclaimer reminding the audience that Renaissance attitudes towards Jews were not exactly politically correct. Shakespeare's script certainly bears this out, which is one reason it still attracts negative criticism on many college campuses.

The director (Michael Radford, who also wrote the adaptation) and cast handle this delicate issue rather adroitly. Pacino manages to elicit more sympathy than derision for Shylock. The only quibble I have with interpretation occurs in the trial scene, in which Shylock's insistence on Antonio's (Jeremy Irons) repayment of his debt (the famous pound of flesh) is rendered much more menacingly and realistically than I've ever seen it portrayed. It really does appear to be imminently possible that Shylock is going to happily flay Antonio alive before Portia or any other contravening authority, such as the  the the Duke (acting as judge) can stop him. This is generally downplayed in stage productions, but on screen it comes across as all too real. It works as far as dramatic tension is concerned, but approaches ""over the top"" as far as aesthetic distancing goes(which is another of the underlying problems of transferring a text from stage to screen).

As far as characterizations are concerned, I was disappointed in only one director's choice. He cut the servant, Launcelot Gobbo's famous ""Devil or Angel"" monologue, which is one of the few truly humorous bits in the play. The scene with the younger and elder Gobbo almost made up for it, however, as Ron Cook serves up a marvellous comic turn as Old Gobbo.

The acting is generally excellent, in fact. Irons is solid, if not entirely convincing as Antonio. Joseph Fiennes does yeoman work as Anonio's bosom buddy, Bassanio. Lynn Collins as Portia is a positive revelation. Her transformation to young male lawyer is dead on. She plays a full range of emotions with utter ease. Hers is the one truly award worthy performance in the movie. Pacino does an outstanding job of remaining in character. The usual Pacino vocal and physical tics are nowhere in evidence. He obviously studied hard for the role and most of his choices are good ones. The cinematography, consisting mainly of shots of Venice in all its resplendance, is extraordinary.

Radford & Company certainly perform no disservice to the bard in this production, which is saying a lot, actually. I'd include it among some of the better recent attempts at bringing Shakespeare to the screen, along with Fishburn's OTHELLO and Branaugh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. It's worth at the very least a rental when it comes out on DVD, but if you get a chance to see it in a theater first, I recommend you avail yourself of the chance, if only to fully appreciate the cinematography.

2246989,3,B0007WRT4Q,"To meet the requirements of an actor crossing the line from a stage performance of a Shakespeare play to a cinematic role is not easy. Pacino succeeds; he  plays the Shylock role quite convincingly.  For me however, the other protagonists are not quite up to the mark.

The movie is beautifully filmed with  spectacular settings.  There is one clummsy transition between two segments but otherwise the technical side of the film is fine. This is where it earns its 3 stars .  Pacino's performance alone is not enough to raise it to 4 stars.

On a finer scale I would give this film 7 stars out of ten.",1106956800,,601,4.5092592592592595
2246990,5,B0007WRT4Q,"After the high school English Lit experience, I've never been a Shakespeare fan, so I've rarely seen any of those of his works that've been put on film. Mired in the bliss of almost total ignorance, I'll yet foolishly suggest that this Big Screen THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is perhaps the most sumptuous cinematic adaptation of any of the Bard's plays to date.

If you're completely without Cultcha and you don't know the plot, it's late 16th century Venice and the import-export merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) borrows 3,000 gold ducats from the Jewish moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino). The money goes to Antonio's chum Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), who'll use it to impress and win the hand of the Babe of his dreams, the orphaned heiress Portia (Lynn Collins). But, Antonio suffers ruinous business setbacks and can't repay. So Shylock, remembering the public contempt shown to him by Antonio in the past and recently humiliated by the desertion of his only daughter to a Christian lover, insists that Antonio pay the penalty stipulated in the terms of the loan agreement, i.e. a pound of his own flesh, literally. And Shylock is prepared to go to the Duke's court to argue the legality of his case under existing Venetian statutes. Things look bleak and potentially painful for Antonio.

Filmed in Luxembourg and the decaying glory of Venice, THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is an extraordinarily lavish feast for the eyes. At times, as I found myself losing the thread of Shakespeare's flowery dialog, I found immense satisfaction in the production's glorious costuming and sets.

Pacino, who, in the past decade, has played cops, the Devil, a pro football coach, and a blind lecher, steals the show with an Oscar-worthy performance. He's perfect as the world-weary, embittered, vengeful loan shark literally and figuratively spat upon by the city's Christian majority. Indeed, the film's creators have done a superb job depicting a Jewish usurer's anachronistic social position in that time and place, i.e. both needed and despised at the same time. And Collins is a revelation as the clever and beautiful Portia, the one character in the piece with any brains compared to the hormone-driven and doltish males around her.

Besides the obvious lessons of the story, which are don't co-sign a loan with your best friend, don't play loose with your wedding ring, and always go for the cheaply wrapped gift box, I was left pondering the evident anti-Semitism of the plot. Indeed, had the play not been written by Shakespeare, and thus considered a ""classic"", but rather something churned out by a Tinseltown hack and put on celluloid, the Political Correct, regardless of the historical facts, would be howling about stereotyping to a degree that would perhaps dwarf the outcry over Mel Gibson's PASSION. The joyful prospect of witnessing the PC's discomfiture  makes this a film worth seeing.",1105574400,134,2878,5.063291139240507
2246991,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Generally speaking I don't tend to get that much out of Shakespeare as cinema. If there's anything that demands to be seen on a stage it's surely these plays. It doesn't help that those who make films of Shakespeare tend to be overwhelmingly preoccupied with `reaching out' to an audience that ordinarily has little interest in or enthusiasm for his work. Fair enough I guess but the result is usually pretty sub-optimal for those of us who already love the stuff to bits, dumbed down and with all that difficult, challenging language - which of course is the whole point - hacked away to a minimum. This film was better than most in these respects: much better than . say, Luhrmann's quite hateful MTV-ified `Romeo and Juliet' a few years back. And the complete absence of the greatly overrated (especially by himself) Kenneth Branagh helps a pile.

This version is, with a merciful lack of mucking about with the setting, staged in a recreation of Venice in Shakespeare's own time. It's completely dominated by Al Pacino's impressive performance as Shylock. As is almost standard practice with this play nowadays the makers have bent over backwards to make him as sympathetic as possible in the hope of exorcizing the obvious concerns about the plays anti-semitism. And indeed, as it turned out, the racial politics in the scene with the Prince of Morocco were, for my money, far more uncomfortable than anything involving Shylock. The risk of this strategy however is that by making us like Shylock more, we inevitably come to like Antonio, Bassanio et al. less, making the aspects of the play that don't involve Shylock much less engaging. And exactly that happens here. The vividness of Pacino's performance is almost unhelp here: the Christian characters seem pretty bloodless and uninteresting in comparison. And by emphasizing the more sombre aspects of the story the comic and romantic elements seem out of place, in particular the casket scenes at Belmont that just fall flat. Indeed many such elements are simply excised: Mackenzie Crook as Lancelot Gobbo is left with little to do and even less to say and the famous opening to Act V with Lorenzo and Jessica ('The moon shines bright; on such a night as this', etc.) is conspicuous by its absence. Lorenzo indeed is almost written out and although the director does much to emphasize Jessica's significance, not least in the final scene, he leaves Zuleikha Robinson with nothing to work with except her facial expression having almost no lines of dialogue left to say. (Although indeed the interpretation Radford is selling us whereby Jessica is deeply troubled by her betrayal of her father is positively undermined by the numerous lines he has cut from her part with e.g. her merry jesting about conversion to Christianity raising the price of pork and such.) But, all that said, this ain't bad. A worthwhile, pretty enjoyable adaptation of Shakespeare that condescends to its audience less than is the norm.  But if you want the real Shakepearean experience in all its magnificence, forget movies: go to the theatre and watch it on a stage where it belongs.",1103068800,,3122,4.933460076045628
2246992,5,B0007WRT4Q,"First of all, I love Shakespeare, so I may be partial to his material. That said, I am not always happy with the Shakespeare
adaptations out there. They have to be very well made, respectful with the original material and very well acted for me to
enjoy them. Michael Radford's ""The Merchant of Venice"" certainly fulfills this criteria.

Having recently seen it, I must say it is indeed excellent. Director Michael Radford (""Il Postino"") does a
commendable job of adapting and directing a very tricky play in his first Shakespeare adaptation. While his direction is confident, it is also sensitive. From the exceptional cast to the production values, this is a wonderful piece of filmmaking from beginning to end.

Al Pacino, who wasn't convincing as Richard III in his documentary ""Looking for Richard"", now turns in a terrific
performance as the Jewish moneylender Shylock in his quest for a pound of Antonio's flesh. While he gets to rave in certain bits, his performance shows admirable restraint and is powerful without being over the top. He gives life to one of the most famous Shakespearean characters in what could be considered a career best.

Jeremy Irons, always an amazing actor at playing angst, now graces the screen as the tortured merchant Antonio with
astonishing command of the material and of his voice.

Joseph Fiennes, who played Shakespeare himself in ""Shakespeare in Love"", is nothing short of excellent as the Venetian nobleman Bassanio, the young man who attempts to win the hand of a wealthy heiress. Once again his classic training pays off in a wonderful way.

Finally, American newcomer Lynn Collins shines in the role of Portia, in a strong, solid performance of Belmont's wealthy
heiress, who is also one of the most interesting female characters written by The Bard.

This is a lavish production, set in 16th century Venice. The costumes are wonderful, and the production design is amazing.

The cinematography is breathtaking, with exquisite textures, and the score is beautiful and effective without being obtrusive. The movie was shot partly in the incredibly beautiful Venice itself, which is quite a treat. Other parts were shot in Luxembourg, and yet the transitions look totally seamless.

Yes, Michael Radford does take a few liberties here and there, and many speeches had to be edited in order to keep the
running time at 138 minutes. He also adds his own personal touch in a few places. These liberties, however, are perfectly respectful to the original material. For example, the suggestion of a homoerotic relationship between Antonio and Bassanio is there, but it is a very plausible way to interpret the original text, it is presented with taste and it is still a suggestion, not an affirmation -- it still depends on what you take from it as a viewer. I also liked the use of close-ups as an effective way of expressing what is not said.

On the subject of the play's anti-semitism, it has to be said that most of the characters are indeed anti-semitic. The film,
however, is not, since we are given the exact context in which the story takes place by the introduction of a prologue.

It has to be mentioned that a good part of the comedy has been sacrificed in favour of the more ""dramatic"" bits, but there is still a great deal of humour in the film, even in parts of the tragedy.

It is a beautiful production: drama, comedy, romance, the themes of forgiveness, justice, revenge, friendship, love, loyalty, are all presented with feeling and a lot of taste. All in all, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",1100304000,20,3559,4.875827814569536

2247002,5,B0007WRT4Q,"The phrase ""a pound of flesh"", written by William Shakespeare in ""The Merchant of Venice"", entered into the English lexicon by the 18th century. It refers to a vengeful payback for a debt or injustice. In the 16th-century story, the Jewish moneylender, Shylock (Al Pacino), loans 3000 ducats, a very hefty sum of money, to Antonio (Jeremy Irons), the merchant and title character. The bond stipulates if the 3000 ducats is not repaid on time, Shylock has the right to extract literally a pound of flesh from Antonio, rather than paying interest. The story concerns essentially three intersecting plots: the loan from Shylock to Antonio, the courtship of Antonio's friend Bassanio with the noblewoman Portia, and the elopement of Shylock's daughter Jessica.

During the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Christians, be they moneylenders, tradesmen, or nobility, were not allowed to charge interest on debts, called usury. Those enacting usury could be fined themselves, imprisoned, or in some cases hanged. However, during the same period, Jews, who were exempt from being able to engage in many aspects of business, were allowed to charge interest on loans, one reason why Jews would eventually have a major presence in finance in modern times. Shakespeare's story begins when Antonio's friend Bassanio desires to woo Portia, a wealthy noblewoman and heiress who is shown in the film living on an island, presumably off the coast of Italy. Bassanio needs financing to make the journey to the island, so Antonio in turn borrows money from Shylock, the wealthy but ostracized Jew. Most of the story takes place in Venice with some scenes on Portia's island palace.

Every character in Michael Radford's beautiful adaption of William Shakespeare's ""comedy"" (although more serious than many of his other comedies) is exquisitely cast. The stand-outs are Al Pacino as Shylock, the money-lending Jew, Jeremy Irons as Antonio, the merchant of Venice, Joseph Fiennes as Bassanio, the love-struck youth seeking Portia, and Lynn Collins as Portia, the single heiress whose stories of her beauty, wealth and availability have spread throughout Europe. According to the Will set forth by Portia's father, a suitor who desires Portia's hand must choose among three caskets/ornate boxes. The potential husband is told that one box contains Portia while the other two do not. If the suitor chooses correctly, he automatically wins Portia's hand in marriage. If he does not choose correctly, he must leave her presence never to return.

From the Middle Ages all the way to circa 1800, Jews were marginalized in Europe. They had to wear special clothing to distinguish themselves from Christians. In Shakespeare's vision, Shylock is constantly harassed by Antonio, until, the latter needs money to help his friend Bassanio in his quest for Portia. Rather than charge interest on the debt if it's not repaid according to the agreement, Shylock desires ""a pound of flesh"" to be taken from Antonio's breast. He stipulates this in the bond or contract for the debt as payback for the many injustices inflicted upon Shylock simply because he is a Jew.

Meanwhile, suitors are coming from all over Europe to attempt the ""game"" of the caskets to win Portia's hand. Simultaneously, Shylock's daughter, Jessica, has fallen in love with a Venetian Christian, against her father's wishes. The different story lines intersect and climax with the famous courtroom scene in which Shylock demands his ""pound of flesh"", arguing his case in a Venetian courtroom presided over by the Duke of Venice. One of the great masterpieces of English literature brought to the large screen with beautiful scenery, costuming and music which does justice to the era in which the story takes place.",1487721600,,3754,5.179571663920923

2247019,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Finely acted and noncontroversial cast versions of Shakespearean plays which are also convincingly set with suitable editing of script to fit within time considerations are relatively rare when it comes to considering film offerings of the plays. This 2004 presentation of the Merchant is remarkably successful and a suitably compelling account.

Perhaps the greatest surprise is the choice of Al Pacino in the role of Shylock. In the event he delivers a performance that easily crosses the Atlantic divide and which shows Shylock as a member of a biased society which is prepared to make use of his wealth but with no return of social acceptance. Ultimately his essential crime is that of wishing to extract the terms of the original commercial agreement and not yielding on those terms. In this he is as unyielding as the society that is prepared to use him but will not accept him. Ultimately he becomes the inevitable victim and loses all but, not perhaps in this presentation, the modern audiences complete sympathy as he becomes outcast from all society without either family or wealth. In this presentation it is possible to feel pity although other less extreme options are rejected. This is very complex with many conflicts to consider and it is a measure of Al Pacino's quality that he is able to convey these various considerations with such conviction.

Jeremy Irons delivers an equally fine performance retaining a sense of proportion and essential humanity even when faced with dire consequences. All the remaining cast deliver at the same exalted level and this amounts to a very fine version indeed.

Inevitably, with such a controversial plot, there will be a range of conflicting responses representing viewers' personal starting and concluding viewpoints but it is not the purpose of this review to take sides in that sort of discussion.

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD.

In summary this BD is a transfer from good quality recent 2004 film stock and has responded well to the upgrade and well worth considering. In summary, it offers an enhanced viewing experience to a playback experience that should give great satisfaction to many supporters of this film.",1474675200,,4215,5.146198830409356

How on Earth did Portia's education prepare her to deliver such a tour de force?

Jeremy Irons (Antonio) and Joseph Fiennes (Bassanio) merit kudos as always.  Lynn Collins - an American who performed with an obliging British accent - was a captivating Portia (and she might still have been had she not gone native).  I understand some of the basis for the negative reviews from purists about how this movie version diverges from Shakespeare's original text.  However, I also believe that Shakespeare himself would have accepted this script, agreeing that it is appropriately calibrated for our own times.  In the original text, just weigh the overall anti-Semitism needed to please an Elizabethan crowd against the impassioned argument that Shakespeare wrote for Shylock to explain the common humanity of Jews and Christians - and people of all faiths - ""if you prick us, do we not bleed?""  Additionally, for those with juvenile complaints about the exposed breasts and the depiction of Antonio's and Bassanio's relationship as homosexual:  the former is historically accurate and the latter is fully consistent with the original text.  In 15th and 16th century Venice, prostitutes bared their breasts publicly, in keeping with the law and customs, to advertise their profession. The basis for construing Bassanio's and Antonio's relationship to be homosexual was most explicitly shown in Bassanio's revelation that he loves Antonio more than he does his own wife; this interpretation of their relationship is also consistent with the poetic homosexual feelings that Shakespeare expressed in some of his sonnets.

The adaptation of the play is very compelling, easy to follow, and just brilliant. The costumes and settings are stunning; and the speeches from ""Hath not a Jew eyes"" and ""The Quality of Mercy is Not Strained"" are inspiring and ultimately rememorable. This movie is a must see for avid Shakespeare fans.",1426636800,,467,5.0
2247100,2,B0007WRT4Q,"This movie rendition of Shakespeares play was largely filmed on location in Venice and the Veneto. This provides fascinating depth and beauty.

However, the misconstrued screenplay greatly reduces the movies appeal.  Strangely, Shylock is  humanized  and depicted in a ridiculously positive fashion, for instance attending the synagogue. There had been no Jews in England for centuries when the play was written and Shylock was obviously conceived as a stereotypical villain. The notion of political correctness simply did not exist in 16th century England!

This bias in the screenplay makes it incoherent. The text at the beginning of the movie describes the plight of Venetian Jews who are locked in the walled Ghetto after sunset.  Yet, minutes later, an evening scene is presented with Shylock visiting Antonio  certainly outside the Ghetto.  Also, the notion of cultural sensitivity does not extend to the African, French, German and Spanish suitors to Portia who are mercilessly portrayed as foolish buffoons.

The acting is marred first by the presence of both American and British accents.  Worse, acting direction is poor with Lynn Collins (Portia) in a light farcical mode, Jeremy Irons (Antonio) in a dark and tragic mode and poorly coiffed and shaved Joseph Fiennes (Bassanio) in an absentee mode.

Overall, the movie may be recommended essentially for its illustration of northern Italy.",1426377600,,1401,5.3807339449541285

I docked it two stars, however, because of the gratuitous nudity in the background (usually) and the men French kissing men and women French kissing women.  Don't see that in Shakespeare's play.

Or similarly when they were standing topless on a staircase with the breasts at the viewers' eyelevel while the men had a conversation in the foreground?  Wish I had known it was coming.  Switched to a different, older version asap.  I don't know why women standing on a bridge in the background have no tops on.  I understand they are trying to portray prostitutes, but really?  Do I need it spelled out that much?  Why two men or two women would give each other a good-bye smooch that involved holding the partner's head except to indicate a lover relationship is beyond me.

This is a beautiful presentation of one of Shakespeare's most interesting plays (remember, the Jews had been kicked out of England by Edward I- in 1290- so there weren't even many Jews for Shakespeare to observe- though it is rumored that Shylock was based on Elizabeth I's doctor, who was a Portuguese converso- Rodrigo Lopez- who finished his days tried, drawn and quartered for treachery he always maintained he had not committed)",1417219200,4,751,4.666666666666667

I can only guess that someone was worried about making a joke of the anti-semitism with which the story deals quite a bit.  Unfortunately, without the humor, this play becomes a pedantic mess, and if that isn't bad enough, they by far canceled out the political correctness by adding numerous, as in just about every other scene, shots of prostitutes jiggling their breasts at passers-by.  So, rather than risk presenting the play in its original comedic form--dark as it was--they transformed it into a paradox of racial sensitivity training and strippers shaking their stuff.  This production is a travesty.  I don't mind a re-doing of an old story, but every alteration this film makes to the great Shakespearean comedy is a further ruination of what the play did well, leaving nothing but a mediocre performance of one or two famous monologues.

2247145,1,B0007WRT4Q,"Whatever nitwit edited this play, he removed 90% of the joy and laughter from it. The pointless chatter of Bassanio, the sharp exchanges between Jessica and the fool, all gone.

Through editing and revision, the director has changed the comedy of the Merchant of Venice into the Tragedy of Shylock.

He opens the picture with a pogrom of the Jews in Venice. A better historical context would be Famagusta, its relationship to Venice, and the role of the Jews in punishing the crusader captives after the Ottoman victory.

Like Iago, Shylock is a wronged individual. And like Othello, Shakespeare explores the theme of excessive revenge. But Othello is a tragedy; the Merchant of Venice a comedy. In a tragedy, the hero has a character flaw that ultimately causes his downfall. Think Othello's jealousy or Hamlet's indecision. In a comedy, the villain has a character flaw and ends by correction/reformation. Think Katherine's transformation from shrew to obedient wife, Shylock's pardon and conversion to Christianity. Why several of Shakespeare's comedies don't sit well with modern sensibilities is that modern audiences don't see the character's change as reformation for the better. In Shakespeare's time, Shylock's conversion marked his movement from an outsider to an accepted member of the established society.  He is now one of the audience. That's what makes it a comedy from a Shakespearean audience's perspective.

2247147,5,B0007WRT4Q,"So far this is my absolute favorite Shakespearian Play/Movie.
The pathos of Al Pacino, (as Shylock), is visceral, and I find myself rooting for him, because of the injustice he suffers.
Shakespeare has created such a magnificent commentary on various social injustices, but in such a way as to skewer both sides of the table. In the midst of this is the lightness of Romance and humor, and when you think it's done, there's still more.
All of this is wrapped up in a fabulous cinematography which reminds me of Rembrandt's paintings.
So often directors will try to use 'low light' to invoke a feeling, but it usually turns to mud.
But here, the low light is so well balanced with highlights, it appears as though the Dutch Masters,
themselves, were painting the whole thing.
Nothing looks contrived, or ""stage-like"", but rather, you ARE in Venice.
For so long I've never really been able to say what my favorite movie is/ was, but now I have to say, this is at the top.
And for Senor Pacino: This is the role he was meant to play. For me, there can never be another Shylock.
Shakespeare at his finest.

Yet, it misses a crucial scene, i.e., Portia giving a letter to Antonio in which he is informed about the sudden recovery of his ships. This scene allows to understand the entire plot; it defines the functionality of Portia; and it unveils the true character of Antonio. In this scene Portia teaches Antonio about the folly of his desperate show of affection towards Bassanio. At the end of the play, Antonio may very well summarize his experiences in the same way as Aragon did:

With one fools head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.

2247164,3,B0007WRT4Q,"The movie bgins with some information about the treatment of Jews in Elizabethan-era Venice. They live in a walled-off ghetto. They have to wear red hats when they go outside the ghetto. They can't get regular jobs so they wind up being money lenders, only charging interest on loans is considered usury so they have to be crafty in how they are paid back. With this information, I expected a much more sympathetic portrayal of the main villain, Shylock. Al Pacino plays Shylock. Viewers might expect a larger-than-life, scenery-chewing performance. Pacino's performance is nicely toned-down, only exploding occasionally for effect. It was probably the best thing about the movie. Seeing Pacino in this role is what drew me to to the film.

The plot is faithful, at least as I remember it from reading the play in high school. Basino has fallen in love with Portia but doesn't have enough money to impress her (or so he thinks). He borrows money from Shylock on his older friend Antonio's credit. Shylock loans 3000 ducats for three months. If Antonio forfeits, Shylock may take a pound of flesh from Antonio's body. Antonio is pretty sure his ships that have gone trading (he is the merchant from the title) will be back long before three months with the money to pay back.

Basino goes off to woo Portia. Portia is an orphan and her wealthy father left specific instructions on who should be her husband. The successful suitor has to chose from three caskets which one has her image in it. The caskets are gold, silver, and lead. Some other suitors fail but Basino wins by guessing it's in the lead casket. There's a marriage and much rejoicing.

Meanwhile, Antonio's ships all fail to return and Shylock is ready to get his revenge (what he calls justice) by legally killing Antonio. Antonio had been both dismissive and abusive of Shylock for years because of his Jewish faith, so Shylock demands recompense. A big court scene finishes that story-line where Shylock argues for justice over mercy and virtually the rest of the cast argue for mercy, even when Basino returns with 6000 of Portia's ducats as repayment. Things end poorly for Shylock.

The production values are quite high and the setting seems like authentic 1600s Venice. Overall the performances are good and Pacino does stand out for his atypical performance. The movie definitely gave a more sympathetic portrayal of Shylock without revising the ending. I do have a few reservations about it (see the advisory below).

Parental Advisory--in addition to the religious tensions in the film, there's an awful lot of topless women. None of the major characters are topless but often there are topless (presumably) prostitutes in the back of street scenes for no apparent reason. Another scene is set in a brothel with some heavy petting going on and more topless women. Also the movie suggests that there is some homosexual attraction or relationship between Basino and Antonio, though the most graphic it gets is a kiss on the mouth between the two. I don't remember anything about that in high school and it seems an odd interpretation since they didn't do anything with it (e.g. they could have portrayed Antonio as a hypocrite for despising the Jew Shylock while he also is part of an unpopular minority). This movie is best for older teens.",1381881600,,3312,4.875666074600355
2247165,3,B0007WRT4Q,"Michael Radford shot this adaptation for the big screen in elaborate period dress, setting the play in Venice contemporary to the date on which the play was written (roughly 1596). Shooting in Luxembourg and Venice their are many scenic backdrops. Many reviewers claim that the film is beautiful to look at, but let's not be hasty. There is a great deal of intervention on the film stock. Everything becomes alternatively period-piece-yellow, making everything the color of clarified butter, or a misty please-call-me-atmospheric blue. Many scenes are heavily backlit. The effect is impressive but unsubtle to say the least. Much more successful is Radford's use of music. His gentle score blends easily with certain fairy tale aspects of the plot (which involves two love tests) and does a great deal to establish a tone.

The most frustrating decisions Radford makes are not as director but screenwriter. Merchant is one of the longer plays, with a very large cast and many memorable characters. Radford attempts to cut the story down to its main characters, (Antonio, Bassanio, Portia and Shylock) depriving us of many memorable characters. Worse many important passages are cut, eliminating many of the subtleties of the character's motivations. Much of Antonio's dialogue with Salanio and Salarino, which provides important insights into Antonio's mysterious melancholy, has disappeared. Portia's review of the suitors, which establishes her as an intelligent and demanding woman (and connecting her to other of Shakespeare's women  like Beatrice and Katherine) is likewise gone. Almost as bad, this is as aggressively modernized a script as I have ever heard performed. Radford updates many archaic Elizabethan words and phrases, several times sacrificing the meter in the process.

With his cast Radford has encouraged a fairly subdued style of acting (a very interesting counterpoint to Trevor Nunn's energetic production). At its best this style blends with the elegant score to create a serene and dreamlike effect. These are the best moments the film has to offer and they are often very striking. Joseph Fiennes's performance as Bassanio basically consists of mugging for the camera and looking intense and sexy. Lynn Colins, deprived of many of Portia's best moments, can offer us little more. They handle the verse competently. Far more satisfying are Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino as Antonio and Shylock. As has often been the case, the film hints at Antonio's possible homo-sexsuality as Bassanio requests money while reclining on Antonio's bed. For me this is a reduction of the character's complex motivations but opinions vary. Irons conveys Antonio's prejudice, his muted sadness and his quiet dignity as a prisoner remarkably. Better still is Al Pacino's Shylock, playing in his own accent, not-for once-affecting a yiddish accent, his is a dignified, old and profoundly wearied Shylock, nearly broken by the racism he endures until his anger rejuvenates him. Yet even in these moments Pacino brings a dignity and measuredness. This performance is summed up in the line ""Sufferance is the badge of all my tribe.""

There are a number of great scenes in this production. Because of its airy and dreamy tone it tends, with the exception of Shylock's scenes, to do better in Belmont than Venice. The former is a world of love tokens and love tests, the latter a realistic world of merchants and laws. The many fine, and unique moments this film offers make it well worth watching but I judge it to be inferior to both the RSC production of the sixties and Trevor Nunn's seminal production in the 00's.",1381795200,6,3615,5.184931506849315

The supporting cast of ""extras"" are also wonderful in painting a true picture of 16th century Venice with all ethnicities and faiths in a melting pot of Europe's great trade city of the time- also underscoring the themes of love, friendship, discrimination, and revenge.

2247170,3,B0007WRT4Q,"This review covers the quality of the production, not the plot.  Presumably you're already familiar with the plot.

Maybe I'm spoiled by the Branaugh versions of Shakespeare, for movies.  For when I see some other version (excepting versions starring Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, or Mel Gibson), there is always a wooden, stilted quality to the lines spoken; such that, if you're not reading the play alongside the words, the words aren't CLEAR.  That's the essential problem with this otherwise-worthwhile, production on the DVD.

Maybe it's a problem with the DVD sound, not the actors' delivery of the lines?  I don't know, but it's very slow-going, unlike reading the play.  Maybe it's the directing.  Can't fault the acting, the cast is first-rate, and they do try to enunciate the lines well, slow the speech down.  Maybe they slow it too much?

Whatever it is that makes this version hard to watch, I had to turn the thing off during the first 20 minutes, due to boredom: saving the DVD for another time, when I can re-read the play and have the lines fresh in mind.  Or, I'll just open the play and read it while watching.  Can't merely watch this play, it's too slow, and the enunciation is not clear enough.  Maybe it will sound better in the VHS format.

2247179,4,B0007WRT4Q,"this is such a difficult story, supposedly a romantic comedy, but so steeped in antisemitism and shakespeare's typical dark underpinnings that it's uncomfortable and painful at times.
while this work skims rather lightly over bassanio and portia's less admirable character traits, such as his laziness and misogyny, and her shockingly ugly treatment of suitors who risk so much to woo her, it does provide a delightful portrait of the truly admirable qualities they both also display- courage, intelligence, and a really wonderful romance.
but the real greatness of this movie is pacino's shylock. at no time is he likable. he's a bitter, mean-spirited, vicious viper. but how often can a character this toxic also display heart-rending glimpses into the reasons why he is the way he is? and his final scene will break your heart.
it's a pity that jessica's story is prettied up here. if you read shakespeare's dialogue, much is revealed in the silences surrounding jessica. she is not welcomed warmly into her husband's society, as is indicated in the movie. her choice has consequences that are not as starkly agonizing as her father's but certainly indicate a difficult future for her.
but i suppose not every nuance can be exploited in every interpretation.
there are a lot of reasons to love this movie, and even it's small lapses don't detract. joseph fiennes smolders, and lynn collins is mesmerizing. but pacino is the riveting genius of this production.

2247194,4,B0007WRT4Q,"The 1980 British TV version of THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is about as pure as theater adaptations get.

Using plain sets and a skilled cast, this episode of the BBC series ""The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare"" has no draconian cuts in the original script. The program runs about 2.5 hours.

In this now very un-PC play, Warren Mitchell as Shylock the universally despised Jewish moneylender is superb during his comeuppance scene. Gemma Jones as Portia is equally fine throughout.

As we see here, the Bard of Avon was a master of language but not always of pacing. One scene in particular is agonizingly long: when Bassanio must choose between a gold, silver or lead ""casket"" in trying to find the one that contains Portia's likeness.

First Portia has a soliloquy that stops the story, then a lutist plays and sings, a chorus joining in near his song's end. Just when it seems Bassanio will finally pick a casket, he launches into this scene's longest speech. By the time Bassanio's finished talking, whatever suspense there was is replaced by annoyance. The ending of this portion of the play feels as if a toe cramp has been unkinked or a headache relieved.

SPOILER (and rant) AHEAD!

Shylock's unique punishment, meted out by Portia disguised as a young ""doctor,"" is in part repulsive religious persecution. Perhaps Anglo audiences of Shakespeare's day thought this villain's undoing clever or proper. Fact is, he is indeed a rat seeking a ""pound of flesh"" revenge from an enemy, yet knocking off his yarmulke and forcing Shylock to kiss and wear a crucifix is both inapt to his prior actions and outrageous. The proverbial ""two wrongs don't make a right"" may have come after Shakespeare's time, but it's nonetheless true.

That issue aside, this particular mounting of ""Venice"" will please any fan of Elizabethan theater.

2247195,5,B0007WRT4Q,"In this humble opinion, the film is atrocious despite Jeremy Irons. Except the odd one out (as it should be) is the one American actor. His Shylock makes the entire film a shining paragon of all things good and real. Al Pacino's performance deserves all the kudoes possible. You can forget all that Underworld stuff he always did to perfection, although this is a take on that.

Reviewers are supposed to point out negative stuff too, so I will cite almost everything else. For example, if contemporary costuming is so important, then why the **** do all the young, virile men have 21st-century mussed hair and 2-day beards and prance about like turkeys and not young, virile men? Portia was a revolutionary development, in that Shakespeare's time traditionally proscribed women to be dopey, helpless, and either (1) sexy, (2) laughable, or (3) both. In drag however, Shakespeare put her into a courtroom to master a man's world in a man's way, deftly and surely. Yet this actress (I suggest forgetting her name) shows that Portia's primary attribute is measured in inches of face powder. Britney Spears might have done better, particularly in the courtroom scene.

SO BUY IT and watch it once a year for the rest of your life. In what other venue does Shylock prove the hero, morally superior despite and due to his breakdown, a lifetime victim in progress? Al Pacino's performance ranks with the best ever applied to Shakespeare anywhere, e'en while making the rest of the production not worth more than the popcorn required to sit through it.",1333324800,,1545,4.870722433460076

They have portrayed Bossanio as a young gigolo taking advantage of Antonio's emotions by extorting monies from him. I thought this a cheap, gratuitous pandering. But I was completely impressed with Pacino's Shylock. He does a masterful job of presenting the contrast of an anti-semitic society against the humanity and commonality of ""the Jew"" as a person. I completely sympathized with him and found myself angered at the so-called Christians. Just short of claiming his ""pound of flesh"" I was completely on his side. I pitied him when his daughter stole his money. This sentiment was not present with me when I read the book, so I think of it as a creation of Pacino. Sheer genius! This version fails miserably at portraying Shylock as a total villain. In closing, I must add that though not coming  even remotely close to the appearance of a young man (she was just too too beautiful), Collins' Portia was very compelling and impressive in the courtroom scene.",1323734400,,1211,4.931372549019608

It's simply not up for debate.  After squandering his wealth but still wishing to woo a broad abroad, a young aristocrat named Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) asks his rich merchant friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons) to bankroll the trip.  Unfortunately, however, Antonio's wealth is not liquid and all his merchandise is out at sea.  Together they must go to local Jewish moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino) for the loan.  The catch?  Out of spite, Antonio recently spit in Shylock's face and then offered no interest loans to hurt his business.  Not wanting to lose business, Shylock is left with the angering proposition of loaning money to an enemy; so, he comes up with a devious concept.  If Antonio cannot repay the loan when it is due, Shylock gets to extract a pound of flesh from Antonio's chest.  After Antonio's ships are lost at sea leading to his insolvency, and Shylock's daughter Jessica elopes with a Christian man and half of her father's wealth, Shylock has the extra hatred needed to demand his grisly justice.

While the verbiage of this tale, and Shakespeare in general, is a difficult to digest at times, there is no mistaking the thunder in Pacino's performance.  Which is good, because nearly every time Kris Marshall speaks it's indecipherable.  What is lost in translation, however, is conveyed by the rest of the cast in emotion.  This is Pacino's acting pinnacle as far as I'm concerned.  His rendition of the famous ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" speech is fire and brimstone.  Captivating.

Great interpretation.  Shakespeare fans will be pleased.

I'm interested in getting this but am wondering about the language. I'm assuming this would be a ""G"" movie to today's audience if they use Shakespeare's words. If it has been ""modernized"", is there swearing? Specifically, is the Lord's name taken in vain? Any ""F"" words?",1289779200,,348,4.612903225806452

Even more impressed by the complexity of the story; many reviews posted here focus on the ""anti-semitism"" of the script (fueled by Shylok's bitter baiting.... more aggressively portrayed by Pacino on the stage.)  However I was ultimately in awe of Shakespeare's clever plot twists which expose all hue of character flaw, Gentile and Jew alike, justified in the name of their respective religions and/ or government(a more contemporary staging might have incorporated Tea-baggers and Muslims).  One is left to conclude that the keen-eyed Bard's true contempt was for any bad behavior justified by any formal religion / law, and his true admiration was only for the romantic / idealistic love and faith envisioned soley by the woman of the tale.

The cinematography was beautiful, but pales in comparison to the plot and the passions of the characters (actors).  A great tale well told.",1287964800,,1055,5.287425149700598

I'm a college grad and thought highly enough of this that I have viewed my own purchased DVD many, many times.  This film is one of those that takes you there, and lets you feel it.  I can't imagine not liking this version, if you like the Shakespeare story at all.  It doesn't hurt if you're a fan of epic movies such as Robert Downey Jr. in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Charleton Heston in ""Ben-Hur,"" Charleton Heston in ""Ten Commandments,"" Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood,"" Gene Kelly in ""Brigadoon,"" and John Wayne in ""The Quiet Man,"" and similarly then you're going to like ""The Merchant of Venice"" just fine.  Of course I also thoroughly enjoy ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" for corresponding reasons, so I guess I can't claim to be a purist. LOL. On the other hand, it was the costuming and sets that piqued my interest in the 2004 release of ""King Arthur"" with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley, and that movie isn't all that faithful to folklore but still ended up in my permanent collection too. I love the epic sagas I guess, but there has to be some decent acting, sets, and costumes - not just a wad of money spent.  Some films that were hawked as huge investments to produce would have been money better spent just about anywhere else on anything else, but in this instance, I highly recommend this Shakespeare based film, whether or not it perfectly echoes the ancient text.  It helps if you like Al Pacino I'll admit, but prepare yourself to see him act out a role unique from other character parts he has portrayed elsewhere.

2247228,5,B0007WRT4Q,"I studied and acted this play in school and thought I knew it but Al Pacino's performance was a stunning revelation.  Pacino is so outstanding in this that everyone else pales by comparison.  His ""hath not a Jew eyes"" speech made me realize as I only suspected before that Shakespeare was making the most profound speech for tolerance.  His courtroom insistence on his pound of flesh acts like a mirror to all that his callousness is merely a reflection of their own callousness in the way they treat slaves and servants.

Since Jews had been banned from England since the 13th century this was probably a plea for religious toleration in Tudor England for Roman Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants.

Director Radford (who is of Jewish ancestry) has filmed this beautifully capturing the artistic sensibility of the period.

Radford includes several small details that add enormously to the impact.  The opening scene where Antonio spits on Shylock sets a tone that no words can equal.  Later, right after hearing the ""Hath not a Jew.."" speech, the character to whom Shylock/Pacino has directed his speech spits on another Jew showing he is completely unmoved by Shylock's very moving speech illustrating the lack of compassion religion has instilled.

The director's commentary on the DVD is well worth listening to.

2247229,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Thanks to a television with subtitle activation, I was served a sumptuous dish of Shakespearean drama in watching this movie.  For a Shakespeare novice like myself, it took some added focus on my part.  This is definitely not a movie for those suffering from attention deficit.  In other words, the dialogue is not fast-food but a multi-course meal with all the trimmings. So eat slowly, tasting and savoring the richness of the poetic lines served you. I'm still picking lines from between my teeth. Yea, a hearty meal indeed.

Because Al Pacino, in the role of a character who's emotions leak all over the script, is such a master actor, all other actors in comparison seemed a bit bland and contrived.  But when you have a master such as Pacino on board, the ship sails successfully through stormy seas making both the heroic as well as the villainous passengers a grand sight to see.

I like the historical aspect of this movie showing the plight of Jews in 16th century Venice, Italy.  To think that centuries before the Warsaw Ghetto of WWII, Jews were being locked behind prison-like gates called a ""geto"", in Venice, Italy. Money lending was one of the few businesses Jews were allowed to operate legally. Call me a sucker for the underdog, but I definitely found myself siding with the Jew.  The movie is a reminder of how society, practicing prejudice and injustice, impregnates its suffering victim(s) with unmerciful hatred and a taste for revenge.

As old Shylock the Jew would so reservedly state:

""Signior Antonio, many a time and oft,
On the Rialto, you have rated me
About my monies, and my usances:
Still I have borne it with a patient shrug:
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.""",1272844800,,1708,4.739864864864865

The production reminded me of ""Shakespeare in love"" and so, if you liked the feel of that, you will enjoy this.  I would say that this production is a great one for someone who has been away from Shakespeare and never quite understood what the fuss was all about - this production lets us see precisely what the genius of Shakespeare was and is.

The acting is superb, Al Pacino fits the role of Shylock very well. I normally don't like the overly dramatic Joseph fiennes but he did an excellent job in this story. In fact, each character played their roles exceptionally well. The play is followed nearly precisely, the costumes are beautifuly done, and the overall feel of the story is accurate.

I give this movie a 5 star rating, for once the movie is accurate to the great Bard's original play, the scenery adds to the story without taking over, and the actors fit the characters well. I have watched several versions of the merchant of venice, this is by far my favorite version yet. Please note however, This is not a childrens movie, there are a few scenes with partial nudity which I felt may have been unnecessary, but they do accurately fit the time period.",1262908800,,1080,4.654450261780105

Due to its split tragic/comedic nature and its purported anti-Semitism, it is one of the most difficult and controversial of all Shakespeare's plays, and I found this rendition to be particularly admirable for attempting, and generally succeeding, an honest and accurate portrayal. The director deserves credit for not sidestepping the difficult and troubling issues that the play raises. I was also interested to discover, to my surprise, that the film attempts to paint a (somewhat) sympathetic portrait of Shylock, as this is one of the most difficult angles that could have been taken. I wrote a paper attempting to prove that Shakespeare intended Shylock as a sympathetic character, and watching a cinematic attempt at depicting this point of view was an enlightening experience for me. The acting in the film was, I thought, quite good. All in all, I found it to be a quality adaptation of an extremely difficult play.",1261008000,,1098,5.209039548022599

As in all of Shakespeare plays, there are no clear good guys and bad guys.  (ok, except for Richard the III and a few others)  Shakespeare is a master of presenting the human condition, warts and all.  The situation in the play is a rather typical social scenario for Jews in whatever country they found themselves. (unfortunately)  Unable to own property or trade as a merchant, they became money lenders; a trade that the ""Christians felt was a sin"".  (but was used by them, none the less).  All the motivating factors for human action are present in spades: love, hate, greed, pride, revenge, martyrdom, and above all...a desire to be understood. One of Shakespeare's most famous speeches is spoken beautifully by Mr. Pacino.  ""Hath not a Jew eyes?""

2247235,4,B0007WRT4Q,"I picked this DVD up at the library with Al Pacino on the front and thought this would be a fun historical piece.  At home, I saw the reference to William Shakespeare.  Normally, this is the kiss of death for me.  I'm sure olde Will had plenty of wonderful things to say, but I always get hung up on actually hearing those words and ideas.  With all the haths and thous and with ofs and so forth, I don't hear the words, but rather hear people trying to speak some odd language.

Since I was already home, I plopped the DVD into the machine, expecting to take it out shortly.  With the credits rolling and before the play is started, we see Venice at around 1600.  We also see what life as a Jew is like back then.  They were forced to live in the old foundry part of the city (called a ""Geto"" in Italian) which was locked up at night, and guarded by Christian cops, who in turn are paid by the jews.  When the jews leave the ghetto, they must on the pain of death, always wear a scarlet cap.  Is  this starting to sound familiar?  It did to me and my interest in WW2 and the holocaust.

Then an odd thing happened about half way through the movie.  I started to hear the words and started to understand the meaning.  This was a new revelation for me and olde Will.  I saw and heard Al Pacino deliver an incredible ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" speech.  (Actually, this meant nothing to me until he said, ""If you prick us, do we not bleed?""  and then things started to make sense.)

The Merchant of Venice is oddly described as a comedy but most of the great lines and action takes place with the tragic figure of Shylock.  I haven't read much of Will's stuff, but I don't know any other of his plays that mixes the comedy and tragedy in equal parts.

Al is superb as Shylock where the normal Pacino mannerisms and voice are generally missing.  With Pacino, we see a nuanced Shylock suffering his loses and going too far in the process.  The rest of the cast is top notch with Jeremy Irons, Joseph Feinnes, and others.  Lynn Collins as Portia really shines, though.  Her transformation (sorry, that's all I'll say) toward the end of the movie is amazing.  Like her husband, I was also taken unawares.

In our day and age, The Merchant of Venice has a distinct anti-semitic feel to it and the question always arises:  Was Shakespeare anti-semitic himself?  Was he a Jew hater?  It amazing how much ink has been written on this subject.  Most of it trying to negate and minimize this issue.  For example, if Shakespeare wrote the""Hath not a Jew eyes"" speech and another speech in the play against slavery, doesn't this prove Shakespeare's belief in universal humanity?  Many critics and people have gone to great lengths in interpreting lines and words in the play to prove their point.

Personally, I don't think Will was any more anti-semitic than his times.  By 1600, Jews had been expelled from Britain for 400 years.  Did he know any?  I doubt it.  I can see Shakespeare writing the Shylock character for different crowds.  One crowd can focus on the evil sinister Shylock and there are numerous lines for that version.  But Shakespeare also offers other options.  Universal humanity is one, but this view appears to be more of an interpretation from our own times.  I see more tragedy in Shylock than evil and perhaps a bit of irony.  This is the Shakespeare I have heard about and like.",1252368000,2,3384,4.425324675324675

2247253,5,B0007WRT4Q,"This play by Shakespeare is worth a pound of gold, at least. It reveals with crudity one side of Shakespeare and Shakespeare's time most people would like to ignore: his supposed anti-Semitism. Everyone wants to ignore it because no one can see the double talk Shakespeare is a great master of. In his days Jews were seen as vultures, tolerated vultures but vultures all the same. Of course Shakespeare could have avoided dealing with the subject. He did deal with it several times. The Saracen in Titus Andronicus is another heroic case. He also had to deal with it because of what was happening around him. Shakespeare was a conscious and socially oriented mirror of his time. His theatre was committed to the real world. He managed to survive longer than his friend and competitor Marlowe because he probably was more prudent and careful. He might have avoided the dangerous spots, nocturnal or diurnal. But even so, he had an art that Marlowe never had. He knew how to speak with a forked tongue, he knew double entendre, he knew double talk and he had many tongues in his many cheeks; This is the case with this particular play and the film, I must say, does not totally show this duplicity. Apart from the famous tirade on the Jew who bleeds when you prick him with a needle, the rest is not seen or shown, and yet it is said. It is not clearly exploited how the ruthlessness and the pitilessness of Skylock is totally and even with a multiplied force inverted and applied to Shylock by the good Christians who do not show the slightness pity or forgiveness or mercy towards the Jew once he is defeated. And the double language is quite obvious in the fact that the learned doctor is an impersonation (note in Shakespeare's time the two women would have been played by two men and then the two women, who would have been men, or rather boys, would have disguised as men) and this does not work today at all the same way since the two women are real women. A false doctor and false man, who is a false woman under that first skin, and who is a real boy under that second skin is speaking the law, justice, truth. What a lie! The only one who is true to his word is Shylock, even if his word is ruthless, but where is the mercy these good Christians were preaching to him, once they have won their case? All that law Shakespeare defends is shown, in the tone of a tragic comedy, as a big lie, as a farce, as a disguise of any truth, and the final episode of the two un-givable rings that were sworn never to be given away and were given to pay the services of two liars and disguised tricksters after the big farce of the use of law to pitilessly fool and victimize a Jew is the most beautiful piece of underground meaning. This is contained in Shakespeare in the balancing act he plays in which any binary element is balance (perfection being four) and any ternary element is disruption. In the ""IF"" little dialogue of the end Bassanio in four lines tries to build a square that never comes and the four ""I"" are the only real balanced element surrounded by three ""gave"" , five ""the ring"", etc. And Portia can answer with a perfect ternary structure revealing how false his reasoning is, but she is the liar, she is the serpent who forced Bassanio into giving the ring, she is the one who was who she was not and who is who she was not either. The accuser once again is a false Daniel. Daniel saved Suzanne from a lie. Portia saved Antonio with the unjust law of Venice enforced by a lying tongue, hers that was his disguising hers. That's how Shakespeare was being witty with anti-Semitism and thus distancing himself from it. Imagine the wit of the man Bassanio telling the boy playing Portia she/he will be his bedfellow and he will let Her/him lie with Her/him when he is absent. Most of the time Shakespeare uses disguises to reveal some good things like love. Here he uses disguises to reveal the forked tongues with which all these Christians are speaking. The film does not show it and prefers adding some images that exonerate the director from the accusation whereas he should exonerate Shakespeare from it, because Shakespeare does not deserve it.

2247255,4,B0007WRT4Q,"It must be remembered when viewing this film that it is a contemporary re-interpretation of the original play by William Shakespeare. It is a reinvention. Therefore some reviewers selected to review it by comparison to the original Shakespeare. In summary, this is not the original. It has been edited and emphasis has been shifted.  It appears that considerable editing of a relatively long play was done, some of which modified the full impact of the characters of Shylock, Antonio and Portia. In addition to the editing for modern audience's attention span, a shift in emphasis was made to address concerns that the play was anti-Semitic and that a more favorable light needed to be cast upon Shylock.

Therefore, I am here reviewing this particular film, a reinterpretation of Shakespeare's play, as an independent product divorced from the original play. When cut lose from the original script, we begin to see that the play has the difficult balance of covering a suspenseful story of revenge  which runs parallel to a comedy of romance, yet using the same actors in both parallel storylines. How does it resolve this parallel structure? It does it by giving both storylines incredible rich attention to exquisite detail, rich costume, elegant lighting, and superb acting. Pacino, Irons, and Lynn Collins are all in top form.

I found the film to be a feast for the eye and ear. As always I found Pacino to be a powerful force on the screen. However Lynn Collins is a new star in the firmament. In the current interpretation, Shylock is both victim and perpetrator and yet his downfall is keenly felt and his final stare into the camera is accusatorial, conveying to the viewer the message that justice has not been done.",1203638400,,1727,4.904109589041096

Also, it is billed s a comedy, but there isn't much funny about it. Wisely, director Michael Radford hones in on the tragic aspects of the play, heightening the twin tragedies of Shylock and Antonio. Al Pacino plays Shylock to the hilt, avoiding an interpretation that has him appear either sinister or victimized: this Shylock is a powerful man, greatly angered, and in the famous ""Does he not bleed?"" speech, there is not a hint of self-pity. I agree that there is a flatness to this production, but I'm not sure i entirely the fault of Radford or his cast. (Axton)",1203552000,,733,4.689922480620155

2247268,5,B0007WRT4Q,"It is absurd to use the relatively  modern term ""anti-Semitism ""as a worrisome point  either in this movie  or in the original late sixteenth century play. It is neither the first nor the only time that a stereotype  aging  male Jew has been used as an almost villainous character in  English literature; notably Fagin the master thief and fence  in Oliver Twist. The movie version of Oliver Twist of 1948 has Alec Guinness playing Fagin's role with no redeeming features in a very  ugly stereotype (much more so than Dickens' portrayal) which seems implausible  so soon after the horrors of the holocaust were revealed in newsreels. In the 1982  made for TV version  George C. Scott excellently plays Fagin as  more of a not unlovable scoundrel than a villain; if less grotesque than the 1948 version it is still  unavoidably a stereotype as that is how Dickens conceived  the character.

In The Merchant of Venice, however, the producer of the film actually  manages the drama in such a way that one actually feels sorry for Shylock as the most sympathetic and deepest character in the whole play. In fact one wonders why Shakespeare did not entitle his  play  ""The Tragedy of  Shylock:The Jew of Venice"". After all  in  the end Shylock loses half his wealth, nearly his life and his daughter. In this film version he  is shown completely humiliated when his fellow Jews shun him (something not  at all indicated in the original drama). As viewers  our sympathy with Shylock  has little to do with our modern  knowledge of where anti-Semitism or any other kind of racist behaviour and such irrational  attitudes lead to, whether to the World  War II holocaust of the Jews  and Gypsies by the Nazis, the Ottoman persecution and holocaust of the Armenians at the end of World War I or the more recent attempted  genocides in former  Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur.

Shakespeare deliberately portrays his heroes. Antonio and Bassanio as rather  shallow and not particularly likable characters in The Merchant of Venice, it is the far more likable  and lovely Portia that emerges as  the winner in this drama and Shylock the loser. What Shakespeare conveys to us and the movie as well is that Shylock's passion for justice is entirely understandable given his shabby treatment as a Jewish moneylender but he has gone too far in demanding the full course of Venetian  justice, after Portia in the guise of a young advocate  has offered him an honourable and gainful way out. In the role of a classical hero Shylock suffers from hubris, he has sworn an oath to his God not to relinquish his claim on Antonio's bond and his demand for unmerciful justice ultimately backfires on him. To me there is nothing  anti-Semitic in that.

The  heavy-handed written  explanation of  renaissance attitudes to Jews  at the beginning of the movie is as unnecessary as the similar one  concerning the decency of average Italian-Americans whenever The Godfather is screened on  mainstream US TV channels. I am sure that anyone unfamiliar with Shakespearean English will not understand any of the Shakespearean movies anyway and the rest will be well versed in  renaissance attitudes to Jews, not much different from those of the  middle ages, the nineteenth  century or the first 45 years or so of the last century,for that matter. The producer put in some less heavy handed scenes at the end  that emphasise  that nobody lived happily ever after. The final scene in the movie, but not in the original drama where Jessica is shown, not as satisfied with her husband  as one might expect.  To marry him she has forsaken her father and her religion, stolen the family jewels and seen her father scorned and humiliated. Her deceased mother's ring is shown still on her finger, and not sold to buy a monkey as was  spitefully told to Shylock. There are no words in this final scene but her face says it all, masterfully! An  Elizabethan audience would not have had any sympathy for Shylock, though I think  Shakespeare did feel  for his character. (Their  characters even if fictitious, become very real for writers). The final scene with Jessica is a modern implant as was the previous screen where a piteous Shylock is shunned by his fellow Jews, a probable outcome of his humiliation in court which would  have been keenly felt by co-religionists who were expecting a triumph of justice for the whole Ghetto. One knows, without Shakespeare or the movie telling  us that Bassanio is bound to cheat on the lovely Portia sometime in the  future, he wouldn't be a renaissance Venetian playboy if he didn't.

The cast is excellent without exception. No ham or emotive acting in this version. The costumes are superb as are the choice of locations. Above all the enchanting  musical background composed by Jocelyn Pook. Al Pacino is at his very best in this movie after accepting some rather poor roles in various movies during the 1990s, and Jeremy Irons is a very believable Antonio. Llyn Collins plays an excellent and very lovely Portia -who would have thought she is a Texan by birth! Oh she is far lovelier than the rather mousy and hammy Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love, with whom she has been unfairly compared!  Joseph Fiennes out does himself again in an Elizabethan role as Bassanio. Special mention must also be made of the very sensuous Zuleikha Robinson (watch out for her in Rome Season Two.) Among the highly entertaining minor  characters Dave Harewood plays a very convincing and amusing role as the Prince of Morocco, one of Portia's suitors and Mackenzie Crook a wonderful Lancelot Gobo, Shylock's treacherous servant.

The cinematography is exquisite. So what if it is somewhat shorter than the original drama, Shakespeare works, unless Bowdlerised, seldom  suffer from  careful editing when transferred to the screen. I highly recommend this movie to all Shakespeare lovers.",1197072000,6,5875,4.885511651469098
2247269,5,B0007WRT4Q,"The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeare's comedies, although it is easy to forget this, as it sometimes has more of the feel of a tragedy. The plot is simple enough: in 16th c. Venice Bassanio falls in love with the beautiful and intelligent Portia, but needs money in order to court her. He turns to his friend Antonio who agrees to borrow 3,000 ducats from the Jewish moneylender Shylock to finance Bassanio's courtship. Shylock is willing to provide the loan at no interest on one condition: Antonio must pay with a pound of his own flesh if he can't repay the money on time. Antonio readily accepts the deal, as he is sure that he will have plenty of money when his ships come in. With his dearly bought wealth Bassanio succeeds at winning Portia, but news arrives that Antonio's ships have sunk. Shylock, already angry at Antonio's and other Christians' past treatment of him, is pushed over the edge by the fact that his daughter (Jessica) has eloped with a Christian boy and taken most of Shylock's wealth with her. Shylock demands that Antonio forfeit his pound of flesh because he can't pay the bond and refuses to accept anything else.

The dilemma that faced this film is the same one that plagues every production of The Merchant of Venice: how do you solve a problem like Shylock? It is his character, more than any other, that highlights the anti-Semitic overtones of this play, something that was prevalent in Shakespeare's society but which is entirely unacceptable today. In my opinion, this film does a wonderful job with Shylock's character, and Al Pacino gives an outstanding performance in the role. Although Shylock is still portrayed as cruel and unforgiving in his pursuit of Antonio's pound of flesh--even going so far as to sharpen his blade in the trial scene where the validity of the bond is being determined--he is not a soulless, evil creature. Instead, he appears a broken man, worn down after years of being spat on and scorned by the same men who later come to ask for a loan--Antonio included. He is a bitter, wounded, tragic figure, whose world is crumbling around him with the betrayal of his daughter (whose elopement and subsequent conversion rejects both her father and her religion). Shylock's haunted face in the final scenes of the film is absolutely heartbreaking, and he is not a man to be reviled as much as a man to be pitied.

Al Pacino is not the only actor to do give a stand-out performance. Jeremy Irons, as Antonio, provides the right air of melancholy and weariness for a man who begins the play by lamenting, ""I know not why I am so sad; it wearies me."" Richard Fiennes (Bassanio) is a gallant young lover and honorable friend, while Lynn Collins is an excellent Portia, and makes a disturbingly good boy in the court scene where her character must pretend to be a male law clerk.

Two other high points of note: the scenery and the music. This was the first movie of the Merchant of Venice to be actually filmed in Venice, and the city makes a gorgeous backdrop. The music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the atmosphere of the film; the two stand-out pieces are ""With Wand'ring Steps"" and the haunting ""Bridal Ballad"" (which plays over the closing credits).

While some Shakespeare purists may be upset that the film does not reproduce every single line of the play (students seeing this movie instead of reading the play, beware!), it is a beautiful interpretation and nothing absolutely vital is left out (although, as other reviewers have noted, some good scenes didn't make the cut). And, I feel, the increased humanization of Shylock in fact adds quite a lot to the original.",1193702400,4,3646,4.7189952904238615

2247271,4,B0007WRT4Q,"A great problem with Shakespeare comedies is that they are difficult to translate to the big screen. Whilst MOV is not, strictly speaking, a comedy perhaps (not sure if Ben Johnson classified it as such), it nevertheless is imbued with much comedy. The casket scenes with the unsuitable suitors, for example, offers an obvious occasion for humour as does the denouement - portia and nerissa's discovery of the traded rings.
This film adapation of MoV provides an example of the difficulties of transferring Shakespearean stage humour to the big screen - just the 'being there' element in theatre is a property essential to comedic tension which film adaptations lack.
For what this film version of MoV lacks in terms of the delivery of comedy, dramatically and visually speaking this film version is a treat - particularly in the courtroom scene while Pacino and Irons as the play's perhaps two most important characters are in fine form.

Al Pacino's shylock interpretation is played as a particularly miserable usurer Jew: an embittered wretch moulded by Venetian cruelty and oppression. His bargaining for the pound of flesh at the beginning of the play is suitably ambiguous regarding whether or not it is intended to be taken seriously and whether or not his offer to Antonio is in fact an act of generosity given that the loan, if repaid in time, would be interest free.
In this particular characterization of Shylock it is easy to sympathize with the character's need for revenge given that which befalls him thereafter, but his seeming complete inability to forgive during the courtroom scene makes us rather side with the ostensibly more merciful venetians again...until they decide to completely humiliate him and take half what he owns and forcibly convert him to Christianity. This sanctinomous treatment is suitably manifest in this film production with Portia shown to be the main instigator of a fairly aggressive form of Venetian justice.

The juxtaposition of Antonio and Shylock as extreme examples of venetian society is also clearly in evidence here. The former symbolizes unbounded generosity, even beyond his means; the latter symbolizes extreme tightness with all things monetary; both, however, are clearly afflicted with weltschmerz perhaps owing to their inability to find some measure of acceptance for that which represents the opposite to which they value most.
In this sense the friction between the two values, necessary for any democratic society to be functional and viable, is clearly expressed. The miserly and uncompromising usurer depends on the merchant, the unconditionally generous libertine merchant depends on the usurer, and the entire superficial liberal ethos of the rest of society depends on both - the scapegoat and the martyr.

The denouement is done well enough although, consistent with the general lack throughout the film, is short on comedy. We understand well enough the need for the new generation of venetians to grow to embrace the responsibility that is required of a democratic, open society in order for it to remain viable - a theme clearly resonant for modern western societies.",1188086400,2,3141,5.203557312252965
2247272,4,B0007WRT4Q,"The male closeness in the opening scenes was a bit too much for my high school students, and the showing of [...] really distracted many students.

2247273,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Like most of Shakespeare's plays, there is more than one story at work here, and if your only familiarity with Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice"" is your last high-school production you probably think it's all about Portia and her romance with Bassanio. This storyline is usually the most popular with teenagers and it does play an important role in pushing the action forward, but it is not the meat of Michael Radford's movie. Instead, this version focuses brilliantly on the conflict between Shylock and Antonio.

It is difficult to imagine a more complex and dark story arc than the one about the clash between these two. Is Antonio the hero? Or is it Shylock? Or is this a contest between villains? One, Shylock, a much despised and downtrodden man, the victim of a lifetime of anti-Semitism, essentially loses his soul and relishes what he sees as his one chance for revenge upon his oppressors in Christian theocratic Venice too much. The other, Antonio, seems like the perfect example of clean and virtuous Christian nobility - a status he has used to routinely degrade and humiliate Shylock while freely making use of his services as a moneylender when it served his interests to do so.

Most productions are unable to capture the depth of these characters, but Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons are superb. Pacino is tormented and angry and is probably not someone you would want to socialize with, but still you can feel the essential craving for justice that underlies it - a justice he deserves. Irons' Antonio would probably make a wonderful dinner companion - handsome, witty, and cultured - and yet there is superciliousness and a hypocritical streak in him that cannot be ignored.

By the time the trial is over, and Portia's legal arguments have spared Antonio and denied Shylock his pound of flesh, the audience is so deeply involved with both characters that no outcome would be completely happy. Perhaps that is why Shakespeare let the romantic storyline play on, to lighten the gloom with some comic relief and a more pleasing finale.

This may not be a version of the play that will appeal youngsters, but it should keep an adult at the edge of his/her seat, and leave them with a much greater appreciation of how REALLY GOOD Shakespeare was as a writer.",1181001600,4,2270,4.827763496143959
2247274,1,B0007WRT4Q,"Short version: Shakespeare is rolling in his grave. This is the worst film adaptation of Shakespeare I have seen. The sets are beautiful, but the normally great Al Pacino's acting here is terrible; ""stilted"" is almost too kind a word. His accent is unbelievably bad. (Deliberate? Read on.) Most of Shakespeare's best lines have been cut. As presented, the story is disjointed and quickly becomes tedious. Bloodless and boring. Get Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing, Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night, or the BBC's As You Like It instead.

Long version: In the middle of the 18th Century, a man named Thomas Bowdler created a 'sanitized' version of Shakespeare's plays for family consumption. (Apparently at that time children were presumed to be educated well enough to understand the bawdy jokes.) The term ""Bowdlerize"" was born. Michael Radford, who directed this film based on his own adaptation of The Merchant of Venice, does Bowdler proud...but not Shakespeare. Radford has redacted many powerful lines from all the main characters. This butchering job is so awful (as is the film overall), that it prompts an exploration of Radford's motives in making this film. I will write more about that later, but for the moment let me point out that two of the director's goals are not in question: first, Radford has taken the odious Shylock, who in the original play has a family resemblance to both Othello's Iago and The Tempest's Caliban, and refashioned him as a tragic lead character reminiscent of Lear. Second, Radford's screenplay demonstrates that he wanted to downplay the anti-Jewish flavor of the play. In doing so, he removed many of the most powerful lines from the players' mouths, such as Shylock's aside:

I hate him for he is a Christian;
...Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!

--which occurs prior to the loan being made, and proves Shylock's sinister intent, despite his subsequent statement to Antonio (kept in the screenplay) that he wants to be friends with Antonio. Simply necessary editing of less essential material to make the play fit into two hours? Hardly; without the missing text, the entire character of the scene is changed! Radford even removed lines that over the centuries have become famously axiomatic, such as Antonio's statement:

The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
...
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

All of the above represents just part of the mangling of one single scene. I noticed the absence of most (all?) of the comparisons of Shylock to the Devil, which are frequent in the play. Among the casualties of the 'Devil' expurgation was Launcelot Gobbo's first monologue. If you have read any Shakespeare, you know how affectionately he treats his Fool characters. In Radford's hands, Gobbo has been reduced to an insipid, anemic waste of screen time.

Radford also struck Portia's dismissal of the Prince of Morocco: ""Let all of his complexion choose me so."" This might imply a hypersensitivity on Radford's part to any odor of racism, but 'complexion' as used in that scene was double entendre. This was an especially unfortunate omission because, as the last line of Act 2, Scene 1, it is supposed to bracket the opening line of the scene, when Morocco says, ""Mislike me not for my complexion..."" Again, I cannot believe this was a simple editing blunder.

Portia is one of Shakespeare's most vibrant ladies, but the direction and pace leave actress Lynn Collins little to work with in portraying her. The film's Portia is earnest but impotent. Jessica fares even more poorly: she is shown as stupid and promiscuous. A low point in the film production-wise is when Jessica's lines,

""O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.""

are accompanied by lightning and a thunderclap! Her face in the mirror is lighted at that moment in a manner suggestive of insanity. But poor Antonio and Bassanio... Radford has decided they are gay. (I can only imagine what he would have done with Frodo and Sam.) There is much more wrong, but I would be writing for days, and this movie does not deserve the attention.

Taken altogether, the major flaws of this film suggest that Radford was attempting deliberately to disparage both The Merchant of Venice and its author. Pacino was his willing accomplice, delivering his lines so badly that if this film were my first contact with Shakespeare, it might be my last. It will be my last with Radford. As for Mr. Pacino...well, sorry, Al...but why'd you do it? The only line he delivered with sincerity was the final phrase of Shylock's famous 'I am a Jew' speech:

""If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.""",1180828800,26,4808,4.9088669950738915
2247275,2,B0007WRT4Q,"I must disagree with those who think that the acting in this version of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice is 'impeccable' 'stunning' and  so on. Actually, the acting is just awful. It is the sort of verbal acting you see in the worst amateur, and regrettably, in most 'professional', productions of Shakespeare.

What you hear in this production is just words said without real understanding or motivation. You hear 'Shakespeare' when  you should be hearing real people talking. Look away from the seductive and beautiful visual images of the film and you will hear what I am saying. None of the characters speak in a real way, including Al Pacino's Shylock. His is a mechanical way of talking and a totally unsympathetic characterisation of someone who has been subjected to the most appalling discrimination in a racist society.

Shakespeare can be real and not sound like 'Shakespeare'. The Director, Peter Brook, wrote a little book in the 60s or 70s called 'The Empty Space' which focusses on what he calls The Deadly Theatre. Shakespeare, he says, is particularly prone to deadly productions. This production of The Merchant of Venice is a prime example of The Deadly Theatre and it is a great shame that other reviewers can not see that very basic fact.

It is an awful production disguised by stunning visual images.",1179360000,8,1323,4.941441441441442

Before I watched the Michael Radford's movie, I read the play ""The Merchant of Venice"". I did not find the play one of Shakespeare's best - I much prefer his tragedies and historical chronics. Perhaps whatever was funny and comical four hundreds years ago does not seem this way now.

""Merchant of Venice"" is based on three different stories - one is the story of three caskets - a girl should marry a man who would solve the riddle of three caskets, the gold, the silver, and the lead one (very weak premises - with many suitors, the secret of the caskets should have been solved in the first day); the next - the story of the merchant who loans the money for his friend from a rich Jewish moneylender and signs the contract that he would give a pound of his own flesh if the debt is not repaid in time (the most interesting and controversial one), and the last one - the story of the rings. While I think that the play is enjoyable, it's got too many holes in the plot to be called an outstanding Shakespeare's work. What is truly outstanding - Shylock's character. He is in the same category as Lear, Yago, and Othello. I am sure that Shakespeare did not write an anti -Semitic play but he described the anti-Semitic views that reigned in the society during his times. He treated Shylock as a human being and with the compassion, which he expressed in the famous Shylock's monologues:

""Shylock: He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew.""

""Shylock: I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.""

By refusing to show the mercy, Shylock orchestrated his own downfall. It is unspeakable that he was spat on by a seemingly decent man but demanding that man's flesh is equally unspeakable. I think that's the reason Shylock was outsmarted at the court and had to lose his case because, technically, Portia's reasons were weak - if Shylock was entitled to the pound of flesh, he was also entitled to the blood that comes with it. To argue that would be the same as to say that one buys an apple but refuses to take the seeds in it or to rent a room but without air in it. What was different in the play comparing to the movie, in the play, we don't see Shylock after the trial - whatever happened to him is behind the scene. In the film, he's got a long shot - after he had to leave his house and convert to Christianity, he became a real pariah - Christians don't want him because he did not become a Christian by his good will and Jews don't want him because he betrayed the faith of his ancestors. And don't forget that his own flesh and blood, his beloved daughter Jessica betrayed and robbed him. The look at Shylock's (Al Pachino's) face in the end of the film is one of the reasons to see it. It is a nice looking movie with one compelling performance (Pachino) and one surprisingly pleasant performance - Lynn Collins who looked like a young Cate Blanchette and delivered her line convincingly. I liked her intelligent, gentle, and full of life Portia. The celebrated Venice known as ""serenissima"" looked mostly dark and dangerous which I think was rather appropriate because of the disturbing scenes that took place in the city.

The film contains an introduction stating that Jews lived in Venice in a ghetto and under oppression, but after that the movie pretty much follows the play. The director's doesn't even shy away from using the play's most controversial lines. But what is more courageous from Radford, I think, is to be faithful to the material as a comedy, the way Shakespeare meant to. To us, in the 21st century, a comedy with a strong (and approving) anti-Semitism element in it, is unthinkable. That is the reason why in the last century, it has always been shown on the stage as something more of a tragedy (this when the play has been staged; for obvious reasons, this excellent play hasn't been staged many times in the last 100 years). The romantic element was also toned down in modern times; this certainly doesn't happen in the movie, where Portia's romantic choices become central. The movie only botches in the way Jeremy Irons plays Antonio. In the play, Antonio is a very arrogant man, something that shows clearly in the scene where the bond with Shylock is agreed on. The arrogance of Antonio is one of the reasons why Shylock hates him so much. But Irons plays him as a one note melancholic man all way along; this makes it somewhat more difficult for us to understand Shylock's thirst for revenge.",1170115200,,1365,4.763713080168777

""Intolerance of the Jews was a fact on 16TH century life, even in Venice, the most powerful and liberal city state in Europe.
By law the Jews were forced to live in the old walled foundry or `Geto' area of the city.  After sundown the gate [to the Geto] was locked and guarded by Christians.
In the daytime any man leaving the [Geto] had to wear a red hat to mark him as a Jew.
The Jews were forbidden to own property.  So they practiced usury, the lending of money [with] interest.  This was against Christian law.
The sophisticated Venetians would turn a blind eye to it but for religious fanatics, who hated the Jews, it was another matter...""

This is how this wonderful movie begins with the above words printed on-screen so as to orient the viewer.  This movie is based on the controversial and troubling play ""The Merchant of Venice"" (written circa 1596) by William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616).

The main plot of this play that the movie concentrates on is as follows:

In sixteenth century Venice, when a Christian merchant named Antonio (Jeremy Irons) must default on a large loan from a Jewish moneylender named Shylock (Al Pacino) for his friend Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) who has romantic ambitions for the rich Portia (Lynn Collins) of Belmont, the vengeful Shylock demands a cruel substitute repayment from Antonio.

As the movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered by Shylock:

""He [Antonio] hath disgraced me and...laughed at my losses, mocked my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's his reasons?  I am a Jew.  Hath not a Jew eyes?  Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?...If you prick us, do we not bleed?  If you tickle us, do we not laugh?  If you poison us, do we not die?""

Shylock continues:

""And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?...If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?  Revenge.  If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example?  Why, revenge!""

Be aware that at the end of the movie, you may not know whether you've seen a tragedy or comedy (the play is officially classified as a comedy), a love story or a tale of hate.  In its infinite ambiguity, the movie and play can be said to be quintessential Shakespeare.

Also, be aware that the movie is entirely in Elizabethan language.  If you are not used to this kind of spoken language, I would strongly recommend that you turn on the closed-captioning.  (The DVD, unfortunately, does not have English subtitles.)

One final caution:  there are bare-breasted prostitutes that appear briefly.  They were not put in the movie to make it more risqu but rather to add some historical authenticity.  Venetian law at the time required all prostitutes to bare their breasts because the Christian authorities were concerned about the rampant homosexuality in the city.  Thus, this movie has a `R' rating because of this (which I think is ludicrous).

The acting in this movie is in a word--fantastic.  I was surprised by this but Al Pacino is thoroughly convincing as Shylock, a very complex role.  I have to also give credit to Jeremy Irons and Ralph Fiennes who do fine jobs in their roles as Antonio and Bassanio respectively.

The cinematography is excellent.  The movie was filmed on location in Venice, The Veneto (region of North Italy), and in Luxembourg.

The background music is exquisite.  I heard a lute, harp, and other instruments that I'm not familiar with.  I learned later that some of the music was contributed by a Baroque string quartet.  (The Baroque period of art was a period between circa 1600 and 1750.)  The background vocals were mesmerizing.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras.

Bottom line:

This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.

2247293,5,B0007WRT4Q,"There are so few truly timeless stories, but Shakespeare's THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is certainly one of them. So much of what came out of this play still resonates in our society today as to boggle the mind. Words like ""Shylock"" are still representative of money lenders (see GET SHORTY), and the themes of vengeance, religion, and forgiveness still live on. ""If you prick me do I not bleed"" is probably the most memorable line in literature, and here we get to see, feel and experience it firsthand in screenwriter and director Michael Radford's excellent adaptation.

For those who've lived under a stone for the past 400 years, The Merchant of Venice is the story of Shylock (Al Pacino, TWO FOR THE MONEY), Antonio (Jeremy Irons, CASANOVA) and Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE), three men who will be tied together by a bond (i.e., financial agreement). Antonio and Bassanio are great friends who live in Venice during religiously tumultuous times. Both are Christians, but Antonio is man of means, while Bassanio is one who's flittered away his family's wealth. Bassanio, now in love with the beautiful heiress Portia (Lynn Collins, THE LAKE HOUSE), must find a way to travel the distant oceans and wed her. Lacking funds, he approaches Antonio, who happens to have all of his moneys tied to ships that remain out to sea but due back with plenty of loot/merchandise, but agrees to extend his own credit so that Bassanio might travel to his true-love's home. They approach Shylock. He agrees to loan Antonio/Bassanio the funds, but only if Antonio signs a bond that, should he fail to pay it pack in three months, will result in Shylock cleaving ""a pound of flesh from nearest Antonio's heart.""

Needless to say, Antonio's ships never return, thus placing him in dire financial straits and owing his flesh to Shylock. At the forefront of all this are the religious aspects. Jews live in the low-rent areas of Venice and are forced to wear red hats (identifying them as Jews to everyone) whenever out in the general population during the day. At night, they are shut in and not allowed to leave the ghetto. They are often spit upon by Christians, and even Antonio does this, something Shylock does not easily forget. And, to add anger to angst, Shylock's daughter has run-off with a Christian boy and turned her back on Judaism. So when Antonio fails to pay good on his debt in three months, Shylock demands his just dessert: the flesh.

That this play was written so long ago yet remains at the center of what we continue to fight about really shows Shakespeare's grasp on humanity.

Radford's adaptation is beautifully filmed (mostly in Venice itself) using the many cobbled streets and porticos to great advantage. The language is also straight from Shakespeare and not modernized in any way (some may find this difficult to follow but it really gives a sense of the times). For English Lit students, this might make a great cliff notes film to watch.

Al Pacino's performance shines as Shylock, the vengeful and ultimately pitiable Jewish money lender who's own unforgiving attitude spells his demise. His commanding presence forces viewers to pay very close attention to every word he speaks. And he speaks them in awesome tones.

It'd be hard to find another Shakespeare adaptation that could stand up to this one. The only one that comes to mind is Shakespeare in Love, but it's not of the same ilk as this flick. Shakespeare in Love is one of my favorite films. The Merchant of Venice is, too,but for entirely different reasons.",1159660800,9,3549,4.828947368421052
2247294,5,B0007WRT4Q,"I always have a soft spot in my heart for film adaptations of Shakespeare.  They are always labors of love, often cribbed together by excellent actors and technicians working well-below scale just for the sheer thrill of working with the Bard.  Even the less-successful productions, such as Mel Gibson's turn as the Prince of Denmark or the recent update of ""Love's Labours Lost"" win my affection if not my undying devotion.

But I had a special place in my heart for a few Shakespearean adaptations, such as Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" Ian McKellan's ""Richard III,"" and even Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet.""  These were bravura, pell-mell, energetic films that made the Bard accessible and personal to me in a way that I couldn't get any other way.  I had thought that it would be a long time until another film jumped into that pantheon.

Michael Radford's ""The Merchant of Venice"" has made the list.  A lush take on one of Shakespeare's ""problem plays,"" ""The Merchant of Venice"" features a reasonably-well-cut two-hour version of Shakespeare's original play, a stellar cast, and a sumptuous visual feast of Venetian delights.  And, perhaps most surprisingly, Al Pacino does not overwhelm the entire production by either chewing the scenery a la ""Scent of a Woman"" or by his sheer star wattage.  Indeed, in a cast that also features Joseph Fiennes and Jeremy Irons, it is a newcomer, the ravishing Lynn Collins as Portia, who nearly steals the show.  Radiating intelligence, wit, humor, and burning sexuality, Collins is a revelation and worth the price of admission on her own.

This ""Merchant"" also has the courage to leave no doubts as to the relationship between Bassanio (Fiennes) and his lover/patron, Antonio (Irons).  This is a mature, focused, respectful production that honors both its audience and the original source material.  Check it out.",1158624000,8,1885,5.041935483870968
2247295,4,B0007WRT4Q,"William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is an excellent and faithful production of Shakespeare's classic.  Joseph Fiennes and Jeremy Irons perform beautifully in the roles given to them.  The women who played Portia and her maid (whose names I can't remember at the moment) were good choices, and the climactic scene where Shylock is about to cut the pound of flesh was carried out with great suspense.  The only reason I don't give this movie a full 5 stars is because of Al Pacino.  Although he acted wonderfully, I just couldn't get over hearing his New York accent come through despite his valiant attempts to disguise it.  In spite of that one flaw, I highly recommend this movie for any fan of Shakespeare.",1152057600,3,717,4.796747967479675
2247296,5,B0007WRT4Q,"I considered going with four stars instead of five for this production, but then I realized that the problems are inherent in the play and no number of stars will make up for that. So, I will grant this production five stars because it is honestly as good a production of this play on screen as you will likely ever see.

Al Pacino is a wonderful Shylock - I was a little afraid of seeing him in this role, as I didn't want to have to sit through the Shakespearean equivalent of ""Attica! Attica!"", but his performance is actually remarkably understated.  Pacino's Shylock is truly a man who has had to keep his feelings and opinions bottled up for decades in order to survive, and so when his rage and malice do come out,they are fearful indeed.  This is the first production of the Merchant of Venice I have seen where it actually looked like Shylock was going to slice Antonio up.  It really looked that way - preparations were made, Antonio was tied down with leather straps, a gag was put in his mouth, yup, it looked like it was coming down for sure --  like Shylock was finally going to get the revenge he had been silently waiting for all these years while he endured insult after insult. And then, when his goal is frustrated he gets quieter yet, as he has learned to do over the years.  I also felt genuinely bad for him when his daughter ran off - she robbed her own father, and that's not a nice thing to do.

Portia was so well disguised as the young doctor that the friend with whom I watched this video (someone who didn't know the play) didn't recognize her and exclaimed, ""Who's the dyke?""!  When I laughed and told her it was Portia in disguise, she seemed amazed at the transformation.  I never thought of Antonio and Bassanio as possibly having been lovers before - that added a new flavor.

I can't figure out why this movie got an ""R"" rating except for the topless prostitutes. Anyway, all in all a very good production, and as good as you are going to get of this very difficult and problematic play.",1146182400,,2022,4.382352941176471
2247297,4,B0007WRT4Q,"After recently viewing an HBO presentation of director Michael Radford's ""The Merchant of Venice."" I found myself reflecting on whether or not in our politically correct, cultural-sensitive centric world, a play written during the Middle Ages when intolerance for those considered outside mainstream society constituted de rigueur behavior could be appreciated under the definition of the typical Shakespearean  comedy rather than as an example of the narrow thinking of a darker age enacted.

Using this production as cinematic scapegoat, I must answer my query with a resounding `no'.  Too much of what Shakespeare intended as witty repartee buttressing the infrastructure binding his soon-to-be conjugal couples and the consequence of their obligations relies on the cruel treatment of societal outsiders.  Shakespeare's view of community in general while depicting the close social interconnection of Venetians in particular appears almost inbred when examined with today's higher powered discrimination-detecting radar.  The one-liners equate not with humor, but with mockery and are all directed at the play's foreigners---most conspicuously at poking fun at the character of Shylock the Jew and Portia's suitors, the Prince of Morocco and the Prince of Arragon. Even Gobbo's blind father escapes not the verbal mistreatment and I can only conclude that medieval men and women were more apt to jeer at those different from themselves while shouting out Middle Age renditions of ethnic jokes.

Consequently, the original play does not weather the test of time well; our hyposensitivity for diversity neutralizes the humor to the degree that having no compulsion to laugh at the discomfort of an old blind man, an old Jew or a pair of foreign wooers, we can only shake our heads at the ignorance of civilization at an earlier time.  In this movie adaptation, Radford attempts to negotiate the culture fissure by prefacing the actual performance with a written out clause meant to temper the feelings of the audience with regard to the play's overt prejudice towards Shylock the Jew and the race he represents.  Pacino portrays Shylock with all the pent-up anger that the character elicits, but with this disclaimer we can interpret his actions and eloquent speeches (in particular, the stellar ""If you prick us, do we not bleed"") to suggest his displeasure at his lower station in society rather than Shakespeare's true intention his anger at Antonio, the merchant of Venice.

With this issue aside, the production itself is lovely to behold.  The city of Venice sparkles like one of Shylock's sun-lit jewels.  The two hour adaptation of a three hour stage performance takes some scenes out of sequence, but does a wonderful job of maintaining the plotline with most of key segments intact.  Jeremy Irons simpers well as the unfortunate Antonio; his finely drawn face depicts more emotion than the well-spoken Shakespearean iambic pentameter.  In the scene where Shylock draws his sword to retrieving his earned `pound of flesh', Irons writhes with a melancholy terror that belies his feelings not just for his situation but for the unrequited love he feels for Joseph Fiennes' Bassanio.  Portia, portrayed by Lynn Collins, an actress of whose previous work I am unfamiliar, has that je ne sais quoi appearance that makes her the faultless androgyny; she plays both womanly woman and woman dressed up as boy to perfection.  Indeed all players try their best to promote Shakespeare's comedic elements and do so admirably albeit even under the strong modern-day deterrent that arises with the blatant anti-Semitic theme.

In spite of its beauty, the Shakespearean jargon becomes somewhat tedious.  I admit that in the comfort of my living room I did flip open my copy of the New Folger Library edition of the play and followed along for greater enjoyment and understanding.

Bottom line:  Shakespeare remains Shakespeare.  Radford does an able job of converting a complicated play to a visually stunning film format.  Due to our more sensitive modern sensibility with regard to the medieval treatment of the societal outcast, the play's larger theme of `all that glitters is not gold' and the emphasis of mercy rather than vengeance sadly are not fully communicated.  Recommended to all who love seeing a Venice of pageantry and a group of players who excel in bringing the Bard's words to a Technicolor reality.

2247311,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Others here have given excellent synopses of the plot, particularly Bruce Kendall, so I won't repeat what they've explained so well.  However, some have brought up the common complaint regarding ""The Merchant of Venice"" as a ""problem"" play, both because of Shylock's being an ""unsympathetic"" character, all sorts of moral ambiguity, and is supposedly lacking in balance due to the seriousness of the Shylock-Antonio conflict presented side by side with the ""lighter"" subject of love--a complaint that seems particularly strange given the natures of these particular love stories, each of which contains at its center a bitterness and cynicism that is actually a bit shocking. Even Portia's great wit and intelligence seem useless and turned to gall--only in disguise can we see what her life could have meant. As a woman, at home, her wit is used to judge and criticise, to ""measure"" each man who presents himself as a suitor, by cleverly (and very amusingly, though one`s laughter is tinged with discomfort) taking him apart, verbally taking a pound of flesh out of each one (for that, one must get out one`s text, as it`s mostly gone from this version).  And there is nothing ""light"" about Jessica's elopement--it breaks her father's heart and doesn't appear to have brought her any greater degree of happiness than that which she had at home (which a Jewish girl would never call ""hell,"" as the Jewish religion doesn`t have one). The play is presented here mostly intact--purists, please remember that things which can only be described onstage can be shown whole in a single shot in a film--and while I agree with Bruce that the ""Devil"" argument that Lancelot has with himself is a necessary speech for explicating the play`s essential themes, I would never have chosen to cut most of Portia`s cynical evaluations of her suitors, as it shows her aforementioned wit in its worst light, making her less ""perfect"" than director Radford would have us think (my one serious criticism of his reading.)

But as this charge of ""unbalanced play"" persists, it's that which I`d like to address, as I don`t agree that the problem exists when one reads it with a serious eye to tone, as well as to actions and their consequences (whereas I do consider ""Much Ado About Nothing"" to be a seriously unbalanced play).  A deeper examination of ""Merchant,"" especially one that's held firmly together by a well-focused director (Michael Radford never loses his hold here, even keeping Al Pacino well in check), the play becomes a coherent piece, where the love stories and the choices presented within their contexts don't contradict the Shylock-Antonio conflict, but in fact mirror it.  And when you consider that each and every character is entirely defined by their relationship to money while at the same time, their wealth has defined the natures of their relationships, both mirroring and the metaphors of the three essential elements of gold, silver, and lead, are at the very core of Shakespeare's play, with everyone and everything's ""worth"" measured to its nearest milligram (as Radford reinforces visually over and over). Within this context, Shylock, through his demand, becomes the moral center of a complex play about the emptiness of valuing only ""that which glitters "" as its this selfsame demand which forces everyone to recognize that the true measure of a man is he himself, not that which he can acquire.

Keeping in mind the mirroring within the play, one can see how Portia`s boxes become a reflection of Antonio`s assessment of Shylock, being as it is based entirely on  his being a Jew, a ""lead box"" rather than a gold one like himself, engaged in a hated trade, which Antonio is unable to recognize as the only trade possible for the acquisition of wealth available to him. Of course, being entirely focused on the acquisition of wealth himself, he is Shylock`s doppelganger in enemy form, and the dreadful treatment he metes out and which leads to Shylock's equally dreadful quest for revenge can be easily read as mirror-imaged self-loathing, as well as mutual loathing: ""I hate him for he is a Christian,"" is as strong a statement as Antonio`s spitting and hatred of the usurer, but with Venice one big box of so much gold that the characters in the play can`t even find uses for it, are bored by it, sick of it, these two men merely reflect the greed in one another and in the whole city, including the locked ghetto where all the Jews must live. The whole play is heavily weighted by lust for money in one form or another, making Shylock's request for flesh rather than more gold absolutely incomprehensible to his fellow Venetians: Why ask for something of substance when one could have gold instead? Does this mean that Shylock should get his flesh? No, but it does mean that he is aware of there being something beyond cash. It also allows us to see, in stark relief, the suffering of people who are not valued at all--the pain that defines Shylock's life is terribly visible, while that which the rich Christians of Venice feel is hidden behind silk curtains and gold-embossed doors. Ironically, he becomes the only humanized human in Venice as his own choice is forced back upon him as relentlessly as he pursued it, and therefore he becomes the only character for whom we truly feel compassion.

Often Portia's box-test (a well-worn tale long before Shakespeare's day) is played for solely comic effect (and now with a sort of post-feminism contempt for the whole situation), but when well-managed by director and actor, with serious attention paid to the text, through Bassanio's contemplation of the three boxes, their messages, and what they are meant to represent and reflect about the chooser, the wisdom of Portia's father's test becomes clear. He, knowing he is dying and therefore will be absent when Portia is marriageable, has found a way for each suitor to reveal his character as well as his intentions. Having seen her as a  ""pearl of great price"" rather than a moneyed prize to be won, he has done all he can to assure that the man she ends up with will be one of worth, one who is willing to ""give and hazard all he has,"" rather than merely smash and grab.

The box choice test is a well-plotted mirroring of Antonio's choice as a man and citizen of Venice. He can either be one of the many who revile the Jewish population, indulge in publicly endorsed acts of contempt proving himself a smug grabber of goods like the men who choose the gold box with its message of ""you will have all you desire,"" or he can be deeper and more thoughtful, a man who examines other men closely, goes against the grain, and chooses to treat the ""lead box"" man, Shylock, decently despite their differences. His poor judgment, which sets the main action of the play in motion, comes round to haunt him once Shylock becomes someone he needs and therefore worth speaking to rather than spitting on, but still is he so arrogant that he doesn't stop to think about Shylock's terms when presented with them. Bassanio is filled with horror at the idea of his dear friend ending up dead or mutilated on his account, being, for all his youth, a man who realizes that privilege is a gift, not a right, while Antonio doesn't stop to think for a moment, so certain is he of the continuation of his good fortune. It's not hard to know which box he'd have chosen in Bassanio's situation. I see no contradiction here between the love story and the Shylock-Antonio story, but rather a clear measuring of mettle through different sorts of tests. Bassanio passes his; Antonio fails, and while spared the terrible and ultimate price, he pays by losing his standing, both in the society and more importantly, in his own mind; illusions are gone, and he's left to confront how he's brought everyone to this pass. To take both box and mirror ideas further, both men are in the same situation, grieving the loss of their dearest loved-ones, both living lives where the outer visage and the inner man are out of balance. As with Portia-Bassanio, the lead box is not only less worthy than the gold, but in fact holds the real source of power, the quest`s reward, but without any wisdom to draw upon, each man instead relies on pre-conceptions when viewing the other, therefore piling ruin upon loss. Each allows the other to entirely blot out everything else until they are living like conjoined twins, locked together, (and if I may borrow from Peter Weiss' ""Marat/Sade"") ""each engaged in happy mutual robbery."" It's one of the most fascinating relationships in all of Shakespeare--up there with that charming Macbeth couple and Othello and Iago.

Another so-called contradiction is Antonio's kindness to Bassanio contrasted with his cruelty to Shylock (in the film, it's implied that the love between the friends is of the ancient Greek, truly Platonic type, of elder and younger men as companions, possibly lovers, with the older one having to now make room for his eromenos to marry--it's a more interesting choice than the usual avuncular/mentor role). But when seen in social context, it's again gold box embracing gold box. It's unthinkable that Antonio would love so dearly a young Jewish man, so this is not as much a reflection of his heart`s bounty, but rather of its selectiveness. Bassanio, though poor, is of the same class, a true citizen, and in Venice perhaps more than anywhere else at the end of the 16th century, one's station dictated every aspect of one's life. His love is genuine, but bestowed on one of his own--not a big stretch for Antonio. So again, I find no contradiction, merely context.

The pound of flesh issue is another old story, used to great advantage in ""Merchant"" when it becomes literal as well as metaphoric through Shylock's relentlessness. Antonio has, unwittingly, set the terms himself by valuing his own person above that of the Jewish men of Venice, by implication equivocating his very person with gold. In fact, as Radford shows, the city regularly buys and sells flesh in the form of Courtesans, which while being the only trade which allowed women to become educated and independent, is still the trading in flesh. Seen from that point of view, Shylock's forfeit is self-evidently logical. Antonio doesn't spit on Christian Venetians, but from his great height, is quite comfortable with the idea that his life is in every way of greater value than Shylock's, and that therefore he`s not even spitting on a person when he meets Shylock in the street. Jeremy Iron's cool persona serves him well in this role, as nothing is more important than that Antonio radiate superiority from every pore, barely needing to speak in order to communicate the sense of bored entitlement and detachment from the problems of others. Only for Bassanio does he consider sacrifice, and again, in his arrogance, he laughs at the notion, never really believing he'll face such a sacrifice; being an impossibility, it's a frighteningly easy bargain for him to make.

Pacino, who can have problems with ""big"" moments, is kept under as tight a rein as the entire play. His Shylock seems to be one who is living a life of ""quiet desperation,"" very much another ""Lefty"" from ""Donny Brasco,"" and in the famous ""If you prick us do we not bleed"" soliloquy  his world-weary pain and sense of waste that all of them in the ghetto experience daily, comes through as anguish, not rage, and is really compelling. His pain at the loss of his daughter, which she neither explains to him nor to us, is even more anguished. And very importantly, in the critical courtroom scene his ferocity is taut rather than ranting--he can`t back down, can't bend, only be broken. His grief over the loss of  his daughter is visibly wearing him down; his intelligence and good business sense, obvious yet useless in a city where a Jew can only function limitedly, has therefore been turned inwards and grown into heavily nurtured bitterness--but finally he has a stage on which to play out the only power he is permitted: that of the law. But being as intractable as he is, the law cannot bend to his will and ultimately defeats him, but that defeat is as impossible to rejoice in as Antonio's reprieve from a penalty that would have brought about his death. The two men, who at the start of the play are standing as tall as they can, end up exhausted, watching one anther across a courtroom, equally ravaged by events, their own destruction entirely of their own doing. If they were twins in hatred, they are doubly twins in ruin.

It is in this scene in particular that Lynn Collins is so commanding and self-assured that one forgets that she's Portia in disguise. Through her flawless performance, both the actress and character guide the play to an end that clarifies the necessity of mercy if one has chosen to live as both Antonio and Shylock have--blinkered, self-satisfied, limited by a lack of empathy or even a basic understanding of humanity. Neither has seen the other as men like themselves, yet at the end, their situations are indistinguishable. By giving Portia the courtroom, we get to see what she`s made of. Shakespeare, in one of his many real strokes of genius, has allowed her to redeem her earlier glibness, to prove that her mind and tongue can be used for justice, rather than superficial judgementalism, and so to prove herself indeed worthy beyond measure; a woman who can bring about justice and self-examination through logic, intelligence, and clarity of vision is indeed a pearl of great price (and it makes a nice change from the boy-in-tights-in-love trouser roles in other plays). Certainly we are clearer afterwards about why her father valued her highly enough to make sure her husband was a man of equal character, intelligence, and clarity of vision. When Bassanio wins her, one is left with the hope that through his integrity (and I see him as the only character who is not entirely selfish--he speaks first of her fortune, but does get around to her virtues and inner beauty), perhaps she will become less acid-tongued and realize that, as her money could not buy his friend's freedom, neither can it buy her license to judge. It's interesting how like Antonio she is in many ways (more mirroring), yet due to the courtroom scene, one can see that she'd have become someone of substance had not her place and time meant being female kept from such occupations as real doctor or lawyer, therefore turning her gifts into flaws.

I appreciated Radford's choice to leave out the sudden re-gaining of fortune that Antonio announces at the end of the play--it`s always felt false and a nullification of all that`s gone before. It's important to remember that Shakespeare had another job besides illuminating human nature in all its colors: ""bums on seats"" was his other mission, and such sudden, miraculous events, comedic moments that aren't ""relief"" but terribly out of tune, were more a concession to that need than people are comfortable acknowledging--an exception is Julie Taymor, who fully embraced his early potboiler ""Titus Andronicus"" and turned it into a film of unflinching ferocity and brilliance with no concern for its current unfashionability or lack of scholarly support. It's a James Ellroy novel in many ways, and she just went for it with the same gusto with which it was written.

""Merchant"" has always been one of my favorite of Shakespeare's plays for its emphasis on deeper values than what society claims, justice, character, mercy, and empathy, and because it's given to the women to make it end as well as possible for everyone, with none of the drive for justice or revenge being motivated by supernatural events, with the truth revealed only through exceptionally mobile ghosts and wise women (though one can't help but love the Weird Sisters). I have to rate Radford's film as highly as Zefferelli's and his heir Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations, nearly as highly as Polanski's merciless ""Macbeth,"" and certainly every bit as compelling as Oliver Parker's singular ""Othello"" (I've already raved about Taymor's ""Titus""). Bringing Shakespeare to the screen is a tricky business, with its requirements of faithfulness to the original text yet the need to edit for time, to replace or augment conversations with visuals, while finding a genuine point of view and the sort of originality that will make it interesting to a modern audience. As Julie Taymor has said many times, if Shakespeare were alive and working today, he'd be a filmmaker; were he to reappear today, once someone had explained to him what  ""directors""  and ""actresses"" are, I think he'd feel Michael Radford and his band of merry men and women had served him pretty well with this film.

A last note: Jocelyn Pook's lovely, eerie score sets the mood perfectly. A unique composer of strange and beautiful music, she uses various instruments from her own viola or piano, to the human voice in all its colors, to create quiet landscapes that mirror the moods of the characters. Never intrusive, yet always drifting on the wind like a subtle perfume, it is yet another of the gorgeous threads Radford uses to weave his story. You can find her on Peter Gabriel's Real World label, where many exciting new composers have found a home.",1142899200,5,17258,4.8552989130434785

2247313,5,B0007WRT4Q,"This is an excellent film version of Merchant.  This is probably one of the most difficult Shakespearean plays to perform in front of a modern audience.  Shylock is hardly the most sympathetic character in the Shakespearean canon and the conventional anti-semitism of Shakespeare's time is hard to stomach.  Shylock is not, however, a stock figure but a complex character and a real challenge for any actor portraying him and any director developing a production.  On the one hand, Shylock has to be shown as someone remorselessly pursuing vengeance without making him into a stick figure of hatred.  On the other hand, Shylock is clearly too powerful a personality to be presented as a passive victim of prejuidice. Al Pacino's performance here is excellent.  His Shylock is a man of pride and authority whose self-control and reliance on legal authority become virtually tragic defects.  His performance elicits real pity without sentiment.  The rest of the cast performs just as well.  Jeremy Irons is excellent as the melancholic Antonio.  Lynn Collins as Portia is tremendous.  Portia is one of those great female Shakespearean roles which can be pulled off by almost any good actress.  Collins, however, is luminous.  The remaining supporting cast is excellent.  The direction, use of music, and cinematography is excellent. The use of different Venetian scenes, with the contrasting environments of commercial Venice ruled by the law, and Portia's palace outside of Venice, ruled by romance and emotion, is a truly Shakespearean device.  I was particularly impressed by the presentation of the climactic trial.  Beautifully staged and acted, it is unusually gripping and directed with real insight. Collins' handling of the famous mercy speech is particularly fine.  She and the director make the question of mercy the central issue of the scene.  Quite a lot of Shakespeare's work has a religous subtext.  The opposition of mercy to law is probably an implicit comparison of Christian salvation, a New Testament innovation, with Judaic emphasis on law, a strong feature of the Old Testament.  Shakespeare's England had essentially no Jews but it did have a strong Puritan minority that tended to look to the Old Testament for models, and who were agitating for a more stringent Church of England.  Merchant should probably be read in part as a commentary on this controversy.

The last twenty years have seen a number of fine Shakespearean films, like Branagh's Henry V and Much Ado, the Ian McKellan Richard III, and others.  This film is an excellent addition to that group.",1141862400,2,2584,5.158653846153846

A beautiful melody would come in, a voice would begin singing, and we would enjoy a landscape or house shot.  Then, the camera would pan down, and there would be someone shown, actually SINGING the music on the audio track, accompanied by players actually PERFORMING the music on the audio track.  The instant transition from extradiagetic music to diagetic music gave me the willies, as it threw me straight into the scene.  Given the amount of scenes with fantastic extradiagetic music, I was always wonderfully surprised when this feature occurred.

I don't need to rehash everything that the other reviewers have said.  The playing-on of the relationship between Bassanio and Antonio, contrary to being creepy, was really very touching... Al Pacino excited enough antipathy, yet generated enough sympathy, to make the audience despise the mindset of 16th-century Venice towards Jews, even though Shylock himself is so despicable... the cinematography and sets were marvellously done, as were the costumes... A+ all around!",1138320000,4,1259,5.333333333333333
2247318,5,B0007WRT4Q,"There is nothing quite like seeing a movie version of a Shakespeare play that is well done.  On the flip-side, it is nothing short of a tragedy of Shakesperian proportions to see people like Calista Flockhart trying in vain to do Shakespeare.  Thankfully, this DVD falls into the former category.

Al Pacino & Jeremy Irons are outstanding in this version of Shakespeare's classic.  I will admit I knew the basic plotline, but had not read it prior to watching the DVD.  THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is one of those plays that most people know the name to, but don't know much beyond that.  Pacino  & Irons bring the story to life with their professional performances.

Unlike many plays of Shakespeare, this one can't readily be transplanted into a different time or interpretation.  The way in which the Jews were segregated in Venice is too central to the plot to try & monkey with the plotline in a different locale.

This particular play is one that will be appreciated by people who have given good-faith loans to people to help them out, only to be shafted when it comes time for the person to repay the loan.  I myself have been in this situation & I could relate to what Antonio (Jeremy Iron's character) was going through.

So, if you like Shakespeare, this one is for you.  It's up there with Kenneth Branaugh's renditions of HAMLET and MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.",1137024000,5,1364,4.633333333333334
2247319,3,B0007WRT4Q,"Though I only give three stars to this filmed version of `The Merchant of Venice,' it is not because the film is a mediocre one. Far from it. It is only because I dislike the original play, and as to the film itself, it is a nearly perfect adaptation. In a sense Michael Radford achieved something impossible because this version succeeds in translating the text into the image without simplifying the complex (and controversial) nature of the Bard's play.

Whatever Shakespeare had originally meant with `The Merchant of Venice,' it is no longer possible for us to dismiss Shylock as stereotype or stock character. Al Pacino knows it, and plays the role with enough energy and pathos for us to sympathize with him. Jeremy Irons, whose recent films have been either `weird' or plain `awful' also gives good understated acting as Antonio, and even (sorry but I insist on using this word `even') ... yes, even Joseph Fiennes is good as Antonio's friend Bassanio with no mugging. But perhaps you might be most impressed with Lynn Collins as Portia, who perfectly fits in the role of one of the most romantic, resourceful, and clever heroines in English literature.

But the complexity of the original drama still remains and of course that is about Shylock. The film begins with long introductory words that explain how the Jewish people were treated in Venice, and we see Shylock and other Jews spitted on by others in the street more than once as if to emphasis its historical accuracy. But as you know, in Shakespeare's play, Shylock disappears in Act 4 and the rest of the play (Act 5) is comedy about the wedding rings of Portia and Jessica. As Radford gives stress on the tragic figure of Shylock, the comedy part of the play naturally looks weak or pointless, and the subplot about Shylock's daughter gets often annoying to see.

But it cannot be helped. Because that's how Shakespeare wrote, and the story of Shylock must be a tragic one (I know that's a comparative modern interpretation, but what else can we do?). On stage, where the audiences could be a small coterie of people who love the theater, the complexity of this drama is not a big problem, for everyone knows the problematic nature of the drama. In this sense Michael Radford's choice among other Shakepeare's dramas should be called a brave one, and as a whole the film is a success in presenting the nature of the play itself intact.

Still, there is another problem that is unique to film in general. At one scene, as you know, Portia and Jessica disguise themselves as males. That device might be acceptable on stage, but on screen, where you can see the details of the disguise clearly, things don't look good. Watching Portia with beard outwitting Shylock is, to me, the least credible section of the film while this scene in the court should be the culmination of his ambition (and its subsequent 'tragic' downfall), the climax of the entire story. I admit the talent of Lynn Collins, but her otherwise perfect acting looks least effective here.

Again I should say this is not a bad film. Remember, though such outstanding actors as Lawrence Olivier had played Shylock for the screen, it was for TV, not for theater, and Radford's version is the first `The Merchant of Venice' that is made for theatre (except the silent versions and the ones made outside English-speaking sphere). The film is complex and flawed, not knowing which to do, comedy or tragedy, but that's because it faithfully reflects the original drama and its complexity.",1136073600,4,3516,4.785831960461285
2247320,4,B0007WRT4Q,"In 16th century Europe, in a play entitled The Merchant of Venice, a young man (Joseph Fiennes) wishes to compete for the hand of a beautiful woman, named Portia. To do this, he needs money of which he is woefully absent of. Asking his best friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons), for the sum, he learns he too is short of funds, but is willing to risks his name and credit with a short term loan from a Jewish money lender named Shylock. (Al Pacino) In my opinion, this is one of his finest and most superb performances in his illustrious career. Despite the fact Bassino wins the hand of his intended, his friend Antonio falls prey to the vengeful and vindictive hatred of money grubbing Shylock who is hell bent on getting his ""Pound of Flesh"" in the courts of Venice. The court room scene is drama at it's very best. Pacino's performance and Irons' reaction is theater at its finest. There are many versions of this Shakespeare play, but with Pacino, Irons and Fiennes it becomes a masterpiece. *****",1134432000,3,995,4.564245810055866
2247331,4,B0007WRT4Q,"To start off, remember that Shakespeare wrote three types of plays. They can be recognized by simple characteristics:

Histories: based on historical fact but pushed through a self serving filter to ingratiate Shakespeare with the monarchy.

Tragedies: everybody important dies by the end.

Comedies: They may be funny, but the key is nobody dies.

By these criteria, the Merchant of Venice is a comedy, although, except for some minor characters, there is very little humorous going on. More on this later.

The center of the play, at least as done for the last century is Shylock. I approached this movie with a little concern we would see Pacino screaming ""Attica! Attica!"" in the last reel. But he was purely magical. HIs power, for once, is restrained; a banked furnace that glowered and threatened, but was never flashy. It was one of his best performances in recent years.

The second plot involving the courtship of Portia is the source of most of the comedy of the play. Traditionally, the plot of the rings is humorously played for the embarrassment it causes Bassanio and Gratiano. Portia and her maid set this up for fun. They know that they will get a big ""gotcha"" in the end.

However, in this production, because the director wants to play up a newly created homosexual subplot between Bassanio and Antonio, the mood is completely changed. The entire last act is changed from a smile behind the hand to a dour ""you can never trust anyone"" downer.

Every director takes liberties with Shakespeare. This is no different. And for me, although the final scenes were a departure from the lighthearted close that is traditionally presented, the power of Pacino's Shylock is more than worth the price of admission.",1133913600,5,1722,4.893470790378007
2247332,4,B0007WRT4Q,"The film version begins with grim historical facts regarding the treatments of Jews.  Introducing this evidence against the conduct of the Christians voids the possibility of comic relief in Venice, at least for the plot of Antonio and Shylock. A pervasive heaviness drowns the characters in Venice's watery streets and dreary gray skies.  Antonio seems to walk with a millstone around his neck, and Shylock festers from his lifetime of degradation at the hands of the Christians.  The Venetian Rialto appears to be an ancient Wall Street, only with the addition of open prostitution and rampant prejudice.  Venice is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place of greed, vice, corruption, and hypocrisy.

Conversely, Belmont is a bright, airy place, with purity and humor.  There the women are chaste, the music is light.  The suitors that come to Belmont are not at all like the merchants in the Rialto; the merchants in Venice are calculating and quickly cruel, the suitors are arrogant and harmless fools.

In the opening scene in the Rialto where Shylock is spit upon by Antonio and also in Act 3, Scene 1 when Salerio and Solanio talk of business, the background of Venice is wallpapered with push-up bras and the contents peeking out.  In the latter scene, Salerio and Salanio sprawl out among the prostitutes, indicating that vice among merchants is all in a day's work.  In the film, however, the prostitutes act as supporting evidence against the Christians, particularly when Shylock enters the brothel and in his famous speech enumerates the wrongdoings of Antonio.  Salerio and Solanio, who both seem to be molded as the basic archetype of a Venetian merchant, straighten up to listen to Shylock.  The decadence of the Christians is exactly the type of behavior that Shylock cannot engage in.  The unspoken message points a finger at the guilty mainstream society.  Solanio says, ""Let me say Amen betimes, lest the devil / Cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew,"" and while Solanio speaks he is leaning on a prostitute, giving awesome religious irony to his actions, his lifestyle, and his culture.

Dramatic.  Pacino is excellent as (almost) always.",1133740800,2,2190,4.942622950819672
2247333,1,B0007WRT4Q,"This is a terrible production of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. The intent of this movie seems to be more focused on the historical and social context of medieval Venice, rather than the human drama that Shakespeare is so keen on portraying. Shakespeare did not write the Merchant of Venice to show his audience ""life in Venice."" Shakespeare's plays could be staged in any setting with his central themes on the human condition still remaining intact.

It's obvious that most of the actors had absolutley no idea what the lines meant. Al Pacino's performance was especially flat. He knew he was playing the part of an old Jewish usurer, but he could not portray how this character thought or what his emotions were, etc. etc. Whenever I watch productions of Shakespeare's plays, especially theatrical ones, it is not all the time that I understand exactly what the  language means. But I can get a good idea from the body language and voice intonatins of the actors who know what their characters are all about, what their motives are, their emotions, thoughts. This aspect is seriously lacking in this movie, making it very unbearable to watch. It's like watching actors just saying a bunch of lines, and not really acting their parts.

The cinematography is awful. What is the point of lavish costumes if one cannot see them? Tops of heads and legs are chopped off in many shots, leaving viewers with uncomfortable ""in-your-face"" close-ups and zero perspective of the actor's surroundings. An actor talks of a penthouse, pointing to it from a canal in one scene, and yet the audience is not permitted to see what the actors are seeing.

For such a movie that takes pains to portray medieval Venice accurately with irrelevant details, the music is certainly not very authenticly medieval. I found it very annoying, especially when it would come on between scene changes. The audience does not need music to know that the scene is changing.

Too Hollywoody with the worst acting I have ever seen. Don't waste time on this one. Try catching a theatrical production instead if you can. You'll be floored by the vast difference in acting abilities, if it's a good production.",1133308800,16,2175,4.883468834688347
2247334,4,B0007WRT4Q,"The costumes, lighting, sets, camera work and all technical aspects are very very good.  The director keeps things moving and flowing too, so no slow or boring parts.

The only thing that bothers me is that it has been adapted from the original Shakespeare in order that the movie could be made and released without boycotts and protests from the ADL and ""Shylocks"" that prevent any movie to be made that portrays Jewish people in anything but the most positive or persecuted victim.  In fact, in the past couple weeks, 3 people have actually been ARRESTED and may get 10 - 20 years in prison just for not believing the ""official"" version of the holocaust.  Famous historian David Irving is one of these latest victims.

Before this movie begins, you are forced to read a ""disclaimer"" of ""anti-Semitism"", and at the end of the movie, there is a scene which is not in the original story at all, which is supposed to bring an emotional feeling of sorrow for Shylock the Jew.

Even in the extra feature on this DVD, Al Pacino tries to make excuses for why he took the part, admitting that this film shows the character Shylock in not as ""anti-Semetic"" portrayal as the original Shakespeare.

It is sad that the only way one can make this classic work into a movie is to alter and adapt it so that it makes the ""bad guy"" in the story out to be ""the victim"".

I also take offense at the misuse of the term ""anti-Semetic"" because MOST Semites are not Jews.

But if you can look past the political correctness and rules that are forced opon the movie industry today in the ""free world"" the acting and movie are really most enjoyable to watch!

But if you read the play first, then watched this movie, and then lastly watched the extra feature on this DVD, you will wonder what the people on the extra feature are talking about, because they describe Shylock's character in a twisted way that is anything but how Shylock the Jew was.

How ANYONE can see a character that refuses to accept DOUBLE the money due to them, but instead insists on cutting a pound of flesh from the person who is offering DOUBLE the payment back on the loan... how anyone can see this character as anything less than the most evil monster is completely insane.

They try hard to justify Shylock as the victim here, else the movie would have been boycotted and protested, yet how can you call anyone that did what this guy did anything but pure evil?

The most ironic thing is that this is a FICTIONAL story!  Yet a certain group of people must find parts in it very close to reality in order to be so afraid of it, and that the actor (Pacino) says he was always afraid to take the part of this character previously, because of being labeled ""Anti-Semitic"".

I think the casting of the characters was excelent and I enjoyed each actor.  Even Pacino, although it was an odd choice to cast an Italian as a Jew.  But at times he plays the part so well that you almost forget about that and beleive he IS Shylock.

This would have been a full 5 stars if not for the ""adaptation"" that changed the story line a bit.  Other than that, the movie is excelent!

There are no English subtitles for this DVD, but it DOES have Close Captioning, so if you have a CC capable TV set, you will have your English subtitles!  And they only cover the botton black bar of the letterboxed video, so the words do not cover any of the picture.

The thing I find most interesting about this Shakespeare play, is how the same exact problems existed in Shakespeare's time as they do in our world today.  Only back then, they were allowed to make plays about it without having to appologize for doing so.

Finally, I note this DVD is ""Rated R for nudity""  I did not see any nudity at all.  Where is the nudity in this film?

I don't see any reason this film couldn't be rated G.",1132963200,5,3818,4.394025604551921
2247335,2,B0007WRT4Q,"I am usually a fan of things considered more ""lowbrow"" and to be honest, this is my first real introduction to William Shakespeare.  I know the basic storylines of his most famous works but this is the first time I experienced a telling of one of his stories from beginning to end.

To be honest, I was less than impressed by Shakespeare's story of ""The Merchant of Venice"" and really find there isn't all that much real substance in Shakespeare's sophisticated reputation of high art.

I am assuming (whether it is correctly or falsely) that this is an accurate retelling of Shakespeare's story.

In it I find Shylock to be the only character of any virtue.  Shylock only seeks revenge for extreme abusive treatment against him.  In seeking his revenge Shylock lends money upfrontly indicating his interest in supplying the loan in hopes of default in which the terms state he can exact his revenge.  So while revenge itself is of ill virtue, the manner that Shylock executes his seeking of revenge is quite upfront and respectable.  And still if the terms of the loan are fulfilled, Shylock receives no compensation whatsoever for his lending the money.  And to fully disclose his vengeful hopes of default, I can find no fault in Shylock whatsover.  His desire of revenge is justified and his methods are beyond any legitimate standard.

Several side storylines aside, troubles fall upon the borrower and Shylock is entitled to his pound of flesh.

Instead of being able to take the life of his foolish enemy, the lawyers find a way to twist language and terms to come to their predetermined decision to not allow Shylock his pound of flesh of his choosing.

Not only do they rob Shylock of his pound of flesh, the legal system further crashes down on Shylock even putting him in a more miserable position than he started with.

I was already sympathetic to Shylock's runaway daughter situation but now his abuses are now compounded by the abuse of the legal system.  A system Shylock entrusted and worked within with nobility and respect for it.

While the message of corruption of legal systems would be an appropriate point to Shakespeare's story, it seems that Shakespeare has little compassion for his Shylock character, as it seems to me Shakespeare more faults Shylock for seeking revenge and also to really think about how his poorly constructed contract brought him down.

Shakespeare ends with a half-hearted reconciliation between the wives and husbands of 2 couples.  Again Shakespeare seems to be sending a message about the wandering husbands yet the wives had behaved with just as much if not fraud and deceit towards the husbands.

In the end Shakespeare's story is full of everybody frauding everbody else and achieving their goals through political corruption.  The only noble character Shylock gets ruined by it all.  Yet Shakespeare's points don't seem to be about Shylock but about points that are not evidenced in the story.

As such, I am entirely unimpressed with Shakespeare and doubt that there really is that much sophistication separating what society considers high and lowbrow.",1132358400,5,3110,4.940384615384615

The delivery of what is, perhaps, Shakespeare's most poignant dialogue shakes one to the very core of one's being. The social commentary as well as the love-hate one feels toward Shylock is electric. Shylock, both victim and agent of misery, is the soul and conscience of everyman. One will want to watch this film again and again.",1127433600,5,506,4.964705882352941
2247339,3,B0007WRT4Q,"As I become older, I find Shakespeare's plays and poems more and more relevant and of interst as a subject of study.  A brilliant human being, whomever he or she was, the 16th-17th century English playwright possessed incredible insight as well as a not insignificant ability to convey his understanding of the human heart into the written and hence spoken word.

'The Merchant of Venice' has never been a particular favorite of mine. I bought this DVD because I am collecting various films depicting the more important works for my own personal edification. I don't recall another filmed version of this particular play, but I have seen it produced on the stage, and read it as a class assignment, and because I live near the Folger Theater in DC, I have seen it produced as it might have been in the century in which it was written.

I find the play enigmatic and somewhat depressing. Various critics have described it as anti-Semitic, and to some extent I can see that case. However, Shylock could have been anyone who lent money and demanded a pound of flesh as collateral. During  period in which the play was written, only Jews were allowed to lend money. At some point the church no longer forbade Christians to lend money, so today, we have Capital One and other money lenders, largely owned by whom? Some would argue these companies demand a pound of flesh if you refuse to pay what they say you ""owe"".

The performances of the actors in this film are often surprising. While Al Pacino plays Shylock with a New York accent, he does it well. His face is as expressive and his gestures as appropriate as any of a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. In my estimation he outperforms both Jeremy Irons and Joseph Fiennes, neither of who turn in their best performance.  However, the actor my husband and I found most convincing and appealing was Lynn Collins, who is a perfect Portia. (Now, I have to go back and re-watch 'Thirteen going on Thirty' in which she apparently starred)

The DVD features include a ""voice-over"" narrative, to help students follow the play as well as an associated web site. Recommended for serious study, not necessarily fun enjoyment.",1126915200,4,2172,4.73015873015873

Unfortunately the joy was removed from the story along with the humor, leaving only a plot containing ignorant, prejudiced people and the heartache their ignorance gave them (oh, did I forget the love story?)

2247381,5,B0007WRT4Q,"If you struggle overmuch with 16th/17th Century English, you will probably hate this film, and miss an exquisite gem of cinema.  I like the English language, but find it laborious most of the time, as I am American and find myself caught up in things modern (too modern sometimes).

Cutting to the chase: the stellar performance goes to Pacino.  He, of course, has given many great performances before.  However, this performance is so great as it fleshes out the character Shylock, such that viewers feel empathy and compassion for Shylock (and persecuted Jews in general); although, Shylock becomes unreasonable to the point of madness (perhaps more empathy?), and creates a terrible stereotype.  In the DVD documentary, Pacino states that he rejected the role of Shylock many times before this production, because the treatment of Shylock was not sympathetic enough in relation to anti-Semitism.  This screenplay struck the right cord with Pacino, which is reflected in his performance.  He gives his all.  Some say they feel they are watching ""Pacino as Shylock,"" which, to them, was distracting.  I felt it was Shylock (period).  I particularly was moved by the scene where he has to say he is ""contented"" to the judge and court.  It is absolutely riveting.  You can feel the momentum of the times, the situation, the consequence, AND the beauty of Christian superiority/mercy over other religions.  (He he he, ha ha ha, . . . I am a Christian.)  Shakespeare's morality lesson is driven home, like an Epiphany.  You see that revenge does have its limits before it becomes self-destructive and, maybe, mercy and forgiveness are best.

Jeremy Irons as Antonio, Joseph Fiennes as Bassanio, and Lynn Collins as Portia round out the cast with perfect performances from all.  Consider use of language, characterizations (gestures, expressions), and a combination of both.  The art direction makes you feel as if you are right there in Venice.  The clothes, buildings, props, all contribute to the storytelling to recreate ancient Venice for the length of the film.

The funny thing is that the character Portia is outstanding as a woman.  Feminists will have issue with the condition that such a brilliant woman (smart, witty, brave, beautiful) is always subject to men, but I (a male) am delighted that a woman of such qualities respects God's Holy Order: God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, husband, wife, and children.  With the world as melting pot and rights for all (a good thing), traditional spiritual values unadulterated by politics (and religious hypocrisy), are rare indeed.  I feel with Affirmative Action and such, women are placed above men based on commercial concepts such as college education (more or less) and modern social position.  Education is good for anyone who strives to better the world as well as themselves.  I'm not sure more career women than wives and mothers is such a good thing.  We get more material things and less character.  Hmmmmm?  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

I love the traditional family unit, where women are moral support for their men and families, not Dictators.  Portia's character is a perfect example of this support.  I fell in love with women all over again, by this example.  She is everything a man could wish for, or a woman could want to be.  Do not forget or underestimate the trial scene.  Portia/Lynn was bested only by Shylock/Pacino when one considers the quality of acting.  Lynn was good but Pacino was best.

Also, the three caskets (gold, silver, lead) are applicable to timeless choices in life.  All that glitters is not gold, nor is that which is dull outside empty inside.

2247382,4,B0007WRT4Q,"`The Merchant of Venice' directed by Michael Radford and starring Al Pacino as Shylock, Jeremy Irons as Antonio (the Merchant of the title), Joseph Fiennes as Bassanio, and Lynn Collins as Portia may be one of the best renditions of Shakespeare on film in the last decade. That may not be saying as much as it sounds, as there seem to have been remarkably few Shakespearean plays done in the last decade. The last one of any note was the version of `A Midsummer's Night Dream' starring Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline.

It's interesting that these two of Shakespeare's plays should be the ones receiving cinematic treatment, as they are two that most defy categorization. They are neither purely comedies and they are certainly not purely tragedies, and they are most certainly not histories.

I have a strong personal attachment to `The Merchant of Venice' as it was the first Shakespearean play I saw performed live while I was in High School and that performance established for once and for all my respect and enjoyment of Shakespearean drama. And, I think the reason for the strong impression was because this one play is so special in Shakespeare's canon. I know that because my experience of that play lead me to take a two semester course in Shakespeare in college, even though my major, philosophy, had no requirements for me to take it.

`The Merchant of Venice' is easily one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays due to the question arising on how the author portrayed Jews through his main character, the moneylender, Shylock. Looking at the play through 21st century eyes can make one believe Shakespeare was casting Jews in a poor light. However, as my instructor convincingly pointed out, if you see Shakespeare's Shylock through 15th century eyes, Shakespeare is being very evenhanded in his portrayal of all characters, including the Jew.

It is easy to forget that `The Merchant of Venice' really involves two major plots intertwined with one another. And, it is unclear to me whether the dealings of Shylock and Antonio or the wooing of Portia by Bassanio is the more important side of the story. In truth, I suspect that both of these two may really be the servant of a third plot element, the importance of justice and mercy, as embodied by the Venetian court, presided over by the Doge (Duke, in Shakespeare's language). The most dramatic scene of the whole play is the court scene where Portia (in the disguise of a young litigator from out of town) frees Antonio from his contract with Shylock. This scene simply would not work if it were not for all parties' respect for Venetian law, and the recognition that if the Doge invalidated the contract between Shylock and Antonio, the civilized world would no longer respect Venice's mercantile agreements, which, of course, were essential to its wealth.

On the other hand, the courtship plot sets up the whole circumstance which leads to Antonio's borrowing money from Shylock and the romantic conclusion of the courtship events end the play, thereby bracketing and encapsulating the whole financial and legal elements of the plot.

Aside from Shylock's famous `... do I not bleed...' speech where the playwright is giving us the clearest notion that Venetian Jews may be suffering from unfair treatment, there are two events which create sympathy for Shylock. The first is in the first scene of the movie where Antonio spits on Shylock simply because he is a Jew. The second is when Shylock's daughter elopes with a Christian, stealing a sizable quantity of jewelry from Shylock's household in the bargain. Both events add moral, if not legal weight to Shylock's vindictiveness against Christian Antonio.

Aside from great Shakespeare's words, one can consider how well this team of Thespians realized this play. While I am certain Shakespeare wrote almost all words spoken on the screen, the director does get a writing credit. I suspect that may have a lot to do with the fact that Shakespeare's original scripts are incredibly sparse in their lack of stage directions. This puts an enormous weight on the creativity of both the director and the actors in interpreting business from Shakespeare's words and from the ways in which the play has been performed in the past.

I believe that between the director and Al Pacino's interpretation gives us Shylock pretty much the way Shakespeare intended. There is no revisionista meddling with our sentiments about the vaguely unpleasant Jewish moneylender. There was no attempt to make the character more sympathetic. Thus, Pacino carries the day with the best performance on the screen. Irons is quite good, which is no surprise, as, like Pacino, he is pretty much playing a type of character for which he is well known. The remainder of the cast is competent, with a positive mention deserved by Lynn Collins when she plays in disguise as a young male lawyer. I did not catch the names, but the two actors who played Portia's other two suitors did excellently charactured performances.

The setting for the film is lush. The exteriors were certainly done in Venice, in all its watery baroque splendor. The interiors appear to have been done in Luxembourg, which does a good job of providing a 15th century courtroom and various other interiors.

If I had any complaint at all about the movie or this DVD capture of the film, it was that in some places, Shakespeare's words did not come out as crisply as they could have on the soundtrack. While this may be a minor complaint for most scripts, when we are listening to the dialogue written by William Shakespeare, we need to hear every single word as clearly as possible. For example, I distinctly recall hearing each and every word spoken clearly in the McCarter theatre 44 years ago when I saw the live performance of the play.

If you like Shakespeare's plays or you can be swayed, you should buy this DVD.",1123891200,4,5882,4.88376753507014
2247383,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Just how instituionalized religious prejudice once was can be seen today in the recent Mel Gibson debasing of ""The Passion of Christ."" The benchmark of how insidious was the practice, however, has always been William Shakespeare's masterful ""The Merchant of Venice."" It accepts unblinkingly the anti-Semitism of Elizabethan England, where it was written and premiered, and of Renaissance Italy, where it is set. The Bard called it a ""comedy."" Audiences reveled in reviling the hapless Jew, Shylock, then not a major character. But for every laugh a director finds in the text today, we pay dearly.

Over the years, Shylock has become the fulcrum of this ""problem play,"" displacing the title character and redirecting its focus and critical appreciation. In his adaptation, director Michael Radford remains respectful of the poetry while reimagining the play as cinema. He draws our attention to its lighthearted romance, social context and human drama, giving each equal weight. In so doing, the director has given us one of our finest Shakespearean films and, in casting Al Pacino as the Jew, a Shylock of harrowing depth. The actor's interpretation of the role is vivid and all his own.

Without altering text, Radford also has given the merchant (Jeremy Irons) another reason for borrowing money from Shylock to help his friend (Joseph Fiennes) court an heiress (Lynn Collins): the merchant is in love with his friend, which in the end all three come to realize. Other examples of oblique insights inform the script, such as the unease of Shylock's daughter, who has fled into Christian arms, revenge as redemption, and the closing playful cruelties. Some playfulness is needed following one of the most powerful courtroom scenes ever written and played to tense perfection here by Pacino, Irons and Collins.

Artfully shot on Venetian locales, lighted, scored and costumed, and acted as naturally as the comedy and tragedy unfold and dovetail, this is a movie for people who avoid Shakespeare movies. It's full of fog and rainstorms, busy and bawdy streets, candlelit interiors, lapidary canals and, well, Venetian life. Fiennes, who played the playwright himself in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" is almost too handsomee. For this DVD, Pacino, who played ""Richard III"" on Broadway and shot a documentary about it (""Looking for Richard,"") joins the other filmmakers in a valuable commentary and a ""making of"" extra.

Add Radford to the list of filmmakers --- Franco Zefferlli, Roman Polanski, Kenneth Branagh, Baz Luhrman, even Gus Van Sandt (""My Own Private Idaho""), and of course Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles before them --- who know how to bring Shakespeare to cinematic life. On film you can show instead of tell, getting to the beating heart of the great plays faster than on stage. The heart of this masterpiece pulsates in every frame of film.",1123804800,4,2851,5.151187904967602
2247384,5,B0007WRT4Q,"This is the fifth Merchant of Venice I've seen, and I've taught the play many times. I expected Al Pacino to be a Godfather-like Shylock. Instead, Pacino is by far the best Shylock I've ever seen--far better than Olivier. Time after time, he'd put in a pause, say a word or phrase in a certain way, and I'd say, ""Yes, that is IT. PERFECT!"" Jeremy Irons is also the best Antonio I've seen. Superb. The others are very good, but not necessarily THE best. Excellent direction. This is the first time I've heard the opening lines done in such a way that they were completely understandable and made good sense.

There are a lot of ways of doing this play. I was worried by the explanation of Venetian anti-semitism at the beginning, as I was afraid the play would be played as ""The Tragedy of Shylock the Jew."" Actually, the play is meant to be a comedy, and probably Shakespeare's audience found Shylock scary and well worth hating, confiming their prejudices, sort of like having a monster in a play. Seeing his plight as a tragedy is natural for us, in the wake of the holocaust, and it is there in the script--but Shakespeare's audience probably would have missed that. (It's not clear if Shakespeare ever actually saw a Jew in his entire life, but he may have seen the execution of one--a Spanish doctor.)

If you collect Shakespeare on DVD, this is definitely one to have. It's certainly the one with the best Venice setting and the best cinematography.",1123804800,3,1455,4.592307692307692

However, this one I wasn't as fond of.  The story was there, but I thought that until the trial the performances were weak and the way that it played on film was very bland.  I was surprised that I didn't even like Pacino's performance in the film.

The film did what very few films have in the thousand or so I have seen in the past few years, it bored me.  I found myself looking for other things to do as I watched it.  It was very slowly paced as well so it seemed like it took forever.

The ending stages of the film were a bit better with a bit more excitement in the court scenes, however, this was negated by the conclusion where they talk nonsense for a bit and then all go away.

There are ways to make Shakespeare's work interesting and exciting on film, but this deffinetly was not one of them.  I would only suggest this to someone if they were a hardcore Shakespeare fan and even then would tell them to be a bit cautious.",1123632000,5,1156,4.171171171171171
2247386,2,B0007WRT4Q,"Come on, anyone who's seen a decent production of this ( or any Shakespeare play) can tell you this is a dud. Some reviewers here will have you believe it's brilliant. Which is beyond me & sparked enough ire in me to write a review.

Films like this are the epitomy of why most of the general public find Shakespeare mind numbingly dull. Any story, Shakespearean or not, cannot be told soley through eye candy. Which is precisely what director Micheal Radford does here. He's far more concerned with lush cinematography & lavish costume design than character development or pace. Any suspense or intrigue (not mention comedy) has been buried beneath the superficiality of ruffle & gown.

We're simply not given the opportunity to care about any of these characters. For the most part, the actors are reduced to set dressing. As for the verse, despite being well spoken, most of the actors might as well be speaking Martian here because most scenes are aimless, never pushing the story forward.

Radford seems to have just left his actors to their own devices in terms of direction. How else do you account for the extras strolling nonchalantly behind Shylock during one of his famous speeches? Distracting to say the least. I half expected Pacino to turn around & yell at them to get out of frame.

Things do perk up a bit in the trial scene, where Pacino does his best to animate the proceedings. However, alot of lines are paraphrased. Thoughout Jeremy Irons does his noble best, but even his talents are buried in Radford's aimless mush of a film.

Sadly, for the most part this is sumptuous but listless veiwing. Anyone who tells you this is a brilliant ought to go back to school to get a degree in pretention. And I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it unless you want to take a nap in the afternoon. While far from the worst film ever made, it is without a doubt exceedingly dull. Further proof that Shakespeare does not easily translate to film.",1122681600,29,1955,4.688046647230321
2247387,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Having watched this film, methinks one is best served by reading Shakespeare's play before watching this adaptation of it.  I've always liked and truly appreciated Shakespeare, and never before have I found myself saying ""huh"" after certain lines of dialogue, but certain parts of this film quite lost me - to a large extent, I think, this is due to the fact that an infernal number of lines are whispered and hard to pick up, let alone translate from Shakespearean English to modern English.  I also had trouble early on distinguishing between two of the male characters (they both had the same grubby, long hairstyle).  And then you've got characters donning and doffing hideous masks left and right, which doesn't help either.  I had no trouble following the principal storyline, but this film left me with questions concerning some of the minor subplots - had I read the play beforehand, I'm sure these questions would not nag me.  The film does feature wonderful cinematography and some really strong actors and actresses in the main roles, and the most crucial scene vibrates with suspense and nervous energy, but I think it plays much, much better to those already familiar with the play.

This is an immensely complicated story that leaves you with much food for thought.  Al Pacino is incredible as Shylock, imbuing his character with power and vehemence that comes off the screen in waves.  I find myself quite torn in my appraisal of Shylock; he is both victim and devil, and Pacino captures his dual nature to outstanding effect.  As a Jew living in 16th century Venice, Shylock (like all of his people) was cruelly treated and persecuted for his race and faith.  One can certainly understand why he tried to exact revenge on one of the wealthy Christians who treated him worse than a dog and personally spat upon him a mere week before coming ask him for a loan.  The situation with his daughter then threw oil on an already burning fire.  Shylock wants revenge, and he has the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) at his mercy, for some ill-timed shipwrecks prevent the far from noble Christian from repaying his debt.  The bond, of course, states that Shylock can extract a pound of his flesh in payment, and Shylock zealously sets out to take Antonio's heart and will be dissuaded by no one.  His race and religion render him all but powerless, so he lusts for the opportunity to legally extract a most bitter revenge.  Shylock is best summed up in his famous ""do we not bleed?"" speech - even the court scenes toward the end cannot match the power of that incredible speech.

The reason Antonio secured the loan in the first place was to enable his young friend to sail to the manor of a fair, rich young lady whose betrothal is basically up for sale - to whomever solves what is basically a puzzle.  There are three small caskets with different clues, and whoever makes the right choice wins the hand of Portia (a perfectly enchanting Lynn Collins).  Several ill-matched suitors fail (much to Portia's relief) before Antonio arrives to take his chance.  The problem with this is the fact that any idiot would know which casket to choose, as it is blatantly obvious.  Portia goes on to play an integral role in Antonio's final appeal, introducing yet another somewhat ridiculous aspect to the story.  The movie doesn't end there, however, as it carries through another new subplot that, in my mind, renders the most dramatic moments of the film anticlimactic - and that's why the movie is well over two hours long.

I really must read Shakespeare's play now because I do want to clear up, if I can, some of the ambiguities I am left with after watching the film.  The central story surrounding Shylock, Antonio, and the bond is very powerful, but those subplots and my difficulty understanding some of the often-whispered dialogue did impede my enjoyment of this particular film as a whole.",1121904000,4,3901,4.772321428571429
2247388,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Shakespeare's most problematic play, at least for 21st century audiences, is clearly ""The Merchant of Venice,"" due to its inherent anti-Semitism, epitomized in the towering figure of Shylock, the Jew. This is the reason Michael Radford's film is the first big-screen version since the silent era, I suppose. I am Jewish, so I had to do a bit of emotional distancing to watch the movie - to understand it and to enjoy it in context. Then I realized that everyone would benefit by considering the historical and dramatic context in which Shakespeare wrote the play.

When the great Bard wrote ""The Merchant of Venice,"" there were almost no Jews living in England. It isn't known whether Shakespeare actually ever came into contact with a Jewish person, and no one knows how much historical knowledge he possessed about Jews living anywhere else. Fact, rumor, myth and legend were handed down through the generations, and Will Shakespeare almost certainly would have been aware of his country's historical folklore.

In the late 12th century, preparation for the Third Crusade brought a heightened level of anti-Jewish sentiment to England. Anti-Semitic violence grew increasingly worse, until in 1275, Jews were forbidden to lend money and charge interest. Jews were predominantly  money-lenders since this was an activity banned by the Catholic Church, and they were not allowed to own land or belong to trade guilds.

With the loss of their primary source of income, and thus their value to the King's coffers, Jews became expendable to the Crown. They were expelled from the country in 1290, and not readmitted, in significant numbers, until 1655. With the Jewish people gone from their midst, the English perception of them began to be formed by old wives' tales that grew in popularity through the centuries. The strongest was undoubtedly that of ritual murder which remained in circulation long after the Jews had been expelled. The most prevalent was that of Jews kidnapping Christian children at Easter, and using their blood in ritual practices for their Passover ceremonies. None of the many horrifying stories had any basis in fact; instead they stemmed from fear of an unknown culture and a different religion. However, they were regarded as truth by most Christians.

Shakespearean drama had its roots in the medieval mystery and miracle plays, performed by Church sponsored touring troupes for primarily illiterate audience. Within these performances some Jewish patriarchs were praised, but for the most part Jews were seen to be responsible for Christ's crucifixion and were vilified. Shakespeare was influenced by the Tudor politics of his time, by history and by earlier theater, including the plays of the Middle Ages, where Jews were seen and portrayed in the most despicable light.

Shakespeare wrote ""The Merchant of Venice"" somewhere between 1595-96. The exact date is unclear, but scholars agree that it was written after ""Romeo and Juliet."" Under Queen Elizabeth I, small groups of Jews fleeing the Inquisition in Spain, quietly began to seek refuge in England, almost 300 years after they were forced to leave.

Thus, these are some of the influences which might have helped Shakespeare to mold the character of Shylock, who is portrayed, with all his flaws, as being persecuted by Christians, unjustly. I am sure that was an eye-opener for the period. Through the eyes of a modern audience, Shylock can be seen as both a three dimensional character and as an  Elizabethan stereotype. I found a bit of the stereotype, but Al Pacino brilliantly portrays an extremely complex man with his measured performance.

The play was originally meant to be a comedy, and since few Jews attended 16th century performances, there was no one to offend, and nothing to interrupt the laughter. Actually, if it were not for the vilification of Jews, there is comedy, cunning and satiric brilliance here, especially in the way Portia goes to court and plays with the law.

Director Michael Radford's film is not a faithful adaptation of the Merchant. Much of the vicious anti-Semitism has been removed. A prologue has been added, establishing sympathy for the treatment of Jews in 16th-century Venice. Antipathy for the Christians is also ratcheted down by striking much of their vitriolic comments and actions.

For those who are not familiar with the work, Antonio is ""The Merchant of Venice,"" (Jeremy Irons is perfect in the role), a man who made his wealth in the import/export business. When the play opens, he appears concerned, as all his money is tied up in four or five business ventures which depend on the successful delivery of various cargos. His beloved friend, Bassanio, (Joseph Fiennes), a handsome, charming free-spirit, has squandered his own fortune and owes Antonio a lot of loot. The merchant has never been concerned with payback. His friend's company brings him much joy and reward, in and of itself.

Bassanio is in love and wishes to woo the lovely Portia, (Lynn Collins), who lives in distant Belmont. He lacks the money for travel, and to woo her in the manner in which she is accustomed. Antonio, wishes to help his friend, but he has no ready cash. He despises Jews and usury, but goes against his grain and obtains a loan of 3,000 ducats from Shylock, (Al Pacino), the Jewish moneylender. Antonio recently spat in the man's face and has insulted him on other occasions, calling him a dog and worse. The shrewd Shylock, is a bitter man. He has prospered through hard work, yet lives in a world which hates him and his people. Men like Antonio curse him for usury, and for not believing in Christ. The two adversaries make a bizarre pact to guarantee the return of the loan. Shylock agrees to charge no interest. Antonio agrees to give Shylock a pound of his flesh if he does not repay the loan in three months. That very evening Shylock receives perhaps the worst blow of his life. His daughter Jessica, (Zuleika Robinson), elopes with a Christian friend of Bassanio's named Lorenzo (Charlie Cox), and agrees to convert to Christianity. Shylock's rage and hatred of the Christians, personified by Antonio, is intensified almost to the point of madness.

There are other various plots and sub-plots, which I am sure you will enjoy when you see the film. Overall, ""The Merchant of Venice"" is an excellent adaptation. It is an intense drama, a tragedy, a romance, a comedy, and a look at social injustice. Pacino's portrayal of Shylock is outstanding. It's just me, probably, but I kept thinking of him as a Sicilian, not a Jew. He took my breath away with his, ""Prick us do we not bleed?"" speech. The rest of the cast does an excellent job and listening to them speak Shakespeare's elegant dialogue is sheer delight. The film is beautifully shot by Benoit Delhomme, and reveals the best of Venice and nearby locations to full advantage.

2247389,5,B0007WRT4Q,"This is the only film version of ""The Merchant of Venice"" since the sound era.  A few TV versions have been done, but none with these production values.  Why is this play avoided?  Frankly, after the Holocaust of WWII, the plain and unavoidable anti-Semitism of the play makes it very painful and uncomfortable for modern audiences.  Fortunately, we are able to think about all the other things the play is and deal with it in a way that admits but does not endorse the Jew hating of Elizabethan England and of all of Europe four hundred years ago.

Does the play have enough payoffs to work through this difficulty?  Absolutely!  For hundreds of years many of the lines and images from this play were part of the living language.  Some, like ""the quality of mercy is not strained"", still are.  We are the poorer if we ignore this play because it makes us uncomfortable.  We put up with embarrassments within our families, why not in our culture?

Many tens of thousands of words have been written about this play.  Many have struggled with the dark story of Shylock and Antonio versus the lightness of Portia and the suitors.  For me, a way of viewing the play that unites all aspects of the play and helps me understand the what is happening with each of the main characters is the notion of treasure.  What is it they hold as treasure in their heart and how does that both reveal who they are and how it motivates what they do?

Shylock treasures his bitterness over the abuse he has received.  He treasures money insofar as it protects him and his daughter.  How little he really cares about money is how willing he is to forego thousands of ducts for a pound of flesh.  How much he cares about the protection his money provides is his shock at his daughter running off and spending fourscore ducats in one night of partying.  You can do this with each of the characters.  You might find your own path through the play.  For me this view reveals humanity in each of the characters and unites the various aspects of the play.

What about this movie?  It is beautiful to look at.  In style it takes advantage of being a movie and uses many visual cues and provides a very intimate performance.  It is powerful and effective.  Al Pacino is magnificent as Shylock and Jeremy Irons brings a wonderful internal contradiction within Antonio that the character himself is unaware of.  Lynn Collins glows as Portia and is as intelligent and as desirable as you imagine her to be when you read the play.

Are there problems with the movie?  I personally think Shakespeare is all about the language more than the images.  So, all the cuts they make for movie bother me a great deal.  The pace of delivering the lines is slower and more naturalistic than I prefer.  I want to hear more of the meter and move things along so that the crush of the words paints the meaning.  Also, they took the liberty of changing some of the words to make them more directly understandable by modern audiences.  To that I say, FIE!  Let us learn more words and more meanings.  We need to hear MORE words not fewer!

One final thing, since this movie is clearly meant for students and classes as well as general audiences (this becomes obvious with the extras), do we really need the prostitutes decorating a few of the scenes walking around with the breasts showing with very red pasties?  I understand the fashion statement and all, but c'mon!  It makes it more difficult for parents to view this with their children and is quite unnecessary to the meaning of the play.  This kind of nudity is an indulgence that some may like, but actually shrinks the audience, in my view.

Still, it is valuable to have this play on film and to view and talk about.  However, go and read the play for yourself.  I recommend the Arden Shakespeare edition.  ISBN 0174434758 and you can see my review of it on Amazon.com by searching for that ISBN number.",1120262400,6,3914,4.53
2247390,4,B0007WRT4Q,"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is a sad and wicked tale; it is a difficult to watch and difficult to comprehend in its cruelty; it is also an excellent story and this is an excellent production. This is not a filming of a stage production; this was filmed as movie throughout and has all of the production values that would be expected of a high end movie.

The story takes place in Venice. A rich man borrows a large some of money from a Jew. His friend puts up a bond for surety of the debt but there is a cruel twist. The friend has long despised all Jews and Shylock, the moneylender, has been on the receiving end of his insults way too often. Shylock demands a curious bond. He will charge no interest. Only the principal must be repaid. The price of default, however, is a pound of flesh to be cut from the living body. Naturally enough, the trading ships upon which this transaction depended were sunk and Shylock wants to claim his pound of flesh.

There are plenty of subplots. Shylock's daughter runs off to marry a Christian. The purpose of the loan to begin with is to help arrange a marriage with a rich noblewoman. That same noblewoman takes up a surreptitious career in law. All of these an others lead back to the central issue, though. Shylock wants his pound of flesh as vengeance.

This film is a difficult one because it was written when sensibilities were different. The anti-Semitism is blatant and is, by necessity, an integral part of the film. The part of Shylock can be played without any sympathy whatever but in this case, his railing against the injustice done to all Jews comes across well and leads, just for a moment, to our seeing him in a sympathetic light. The noble who must forfeit the pound of flesh (and thus his life) also comes across as a dislikable character. His racism is blatant and he offers no apologies for it. He too becomes more sympathetic and the moment of his impending death grows near but that sympathy diminishes rapidly as he takes his own revenge. All in all, there is no one who is really likable but that does not stop this from being a compelling bit of theater.

Other MERCHANT OF VENICE productions have been better. Some are more complete. Some are more easy to empathize with. Some are just plain more engaging to watch but this one, on the whole, is very good. It is the best Hollywood style production of this work to date.",1120089600,2,2384,4.4610091743119265
2247411,5,B0007WRT4Q,"All my life I've heard about this Shakespearean play.  I've never read it, studied it or seen it performed though.  I think that's because it's supposed to be anti-Semitic and our politically correct times have avoided it for fear of offending anyone.  I was therefore delighted to be able to see this 2004 movie version of the play, starring Al Pacino in the role of Shylock, the Jewish money lender who demanded a pound of flesh from merchant Antonio, played by Jeremy Irons.  There is high drama, grand conflict, and, from the very beginning I was drawn into the story, set in 16th Century Venice.

When Bassanio, played by Joseph Fiennes, asks his friend Antonio for a loan in order to court the beautiful Portia, Antonio cannot refuse, even though he is cash-poor at the time because all his money is tied up in several cargo ships which he is sure will have successful voyages.  That is why he is willing to go the money lender, Shylock, and sign a ridiculous agreement, pledging a pound of flesh to settle the debt if he doesn't have the actual money by a certain date.  Antonio's been successful all his life and fully expects to pay the debt to the Jew who he obviously holds in contempt.  The first scene in the play even shows Antonio spitting on Shylock.  In those days Jews lived in ghettos and one of the only professions open to them was money lending.  Christians, on the other hand, could not lend money because their religion forbade them from asking for interest.  Even though the economy was fueled by the Jews, they were completely despised.

Anyway, Bassanio does win the heart of the fair Portia who we soon learn is a lot smarter than her background of being a pampered lady would suggest.  Later, when Antonio is in court trying to defend himself from the wicked Shylock, she disguises herself as a lawyer and wins the case.  Brilliantly acted by the beautiful Lynn Collins, I was impressed by her acting skills as well as her stage presence which caused her to be the central focus of every scene she was in.

Even though it is unlikely that Shakespeare himself ever visited Venice or even met a Jew, his writing really brings out his understanding of humanity.  Shylock is the product of his times, painfully aware of his place in the world and yet very much a sad and tortured person.  Al Pacino plays this role with full emotional intensity and some of his lines brought tears to my eyes, especially when he realizes that he has gone too far in his rage and Portia has made a fool of him.

How this was all interpreted by the filmmakers is nothing short of brilliant.  I loved the production, the cinematography, and the wonderful performances.  The use of film even makes the original play better because now it is possible to get reaction shots and closeups and show huge sweeping scenes of the pomp of the palaces.  Surely, if Shakespeare had film available to him in his day, he would have mastered its use.  We don't know exactly how he would have used it then; we can only see interpretations today.  And, as far as I'm concerned, this interpretation is excellent.

There's no doubt about it.  The Merchant of Venice is an excellent production.  I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it.",1119744000,5,3241,4.601045296167247
2247412,5,B0007WRT4Q,"I'm always a bit surprised how many people still approach screen adaptations of Shakespeare's work as though it should a completely faithful representation of the original stagework.  Obviously, Shakespeare was writing for a different audience under different circumstances - that his stories resonate still so strongly - and are the stuff of dreams for actors of every era is credit to his genius.  That we can have a director who finds the true relevance - and can prune the 3+ hour script to fit a modernistic vision without destroying the heart of Shakespeare's original makes this a happy time for those of us who love the Bard however we can get him.

I have to disagree with one of Amazon's top reviewers here who complained that the ""pound of flesh"" scene was rendered too realistically.  The situation that Shakespeare filtered through director Michael Radford's own particular genius, has created here is one of such riveting drama, I found my cheeks stained with tears at the horrors that cruelty, corruption, racism and the extraction of revenge can wreak on a so-called ""civilized society.""  Pacino's encapsulation of Shylock's defeat is all the more tragic and utterly pitiable because of the limits he was ready to blindly exceed in the name of ""justice.""

Pacino along with Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes, Lynn Collins, Zuleikha Robinson, Heather Goldenhersh, and Kris Marshall head an international cast that seemed to be of one mind with Michael Radford's project and present an ensemble that (pardon the pun) cuts right to the meat of the matters at hand.

Visually, this is about as opulent and naturalistic as film can get.  Combined with a score mixed of 16th century feeling modern film music and some

Shakespeare's half millennia old play still resonates on issues of racism, social distinction, love, loyalty and the power of friendship.  This film should not be missed.",1118016000,14,1894,5.061093247588424
2247413,2,B0007WRT4Q,"This film seemed to have everything going for it, i.e., great actors, beautiful sets, fine music, not to mention the Bard himself as screenwriter.  Unfortunately, it fell quite flat for me.

Al Pacino showed such great talent for Shakespeare in ""Looking for Richard"" that I hardly thought that his Shylock would be as awkward as it was.  Pacino did not seem to know exactly how to play the part and this is evidenced in how he seemed to stumble through Shylock's various guises.  It must be said that he is not entirely to blame.  The opening of the film gives a brief historical account of the status of Jews in 16th century Venetia.  This is followed upon by an added scene where Shylock is harrassed and spat upon by Bassanio.  This introduction immediately encourages us to take an initially sympathic attitude towards the part of a comic villain.  More important than Venetian anti-Semitism, I believe, is the understanding that when Shakespeare wrote the Merchant, Jews had been expelled from England for over 300 years.  A Shylock-type character would have been a completely foreign personality to the average London playgoer at the time as well as to Shakespeare.  Compared to 16th century Jewish stereotypes (contrast Marlowe's Barabas), Shakespeare's treatment seemed to be more aggravated towards the ""miserly"" Shylock as opposed to the ""Jewish"" Shylock.

That said, it still remains a very difficult character to present to modern audiences without many feeling uncomfortable.  Both Pacino and the director did a great deal towards garnering our sympathies towards Shylock.  Through most of the film, perhaps just up to the discussion of Shylock's and Tubal's regarding the missing Jessica, Shylock evokes great pity.  For instance, I had never seen such the loss of a child in cinema expressed with such heart-rending cries as Pacino does when he discovers that his daughter Jessica has eloped.  But amidst this deep pity we feel, we are introduced to the other characters of the play who seem almost hateful in reaction.  Bassanio is shown an cruel anti-Semite (before the actual play even gets started), causing me to dislike the character who otherwise would have evoked sympathy himself.  Antonio never seems anything better than excessively greedy and his romance of Portia is never removed of its monetary overtones as it so easily is in other stage productions.  Portia, however, seems to remain stellar and humerous though one can't help wonder, even after the film ends, what she ever saw in Antonio (I think she would have been just has happy with Morocco).

Much of the film could have avoided trouble by simply leaving our pity for Shylock to be gained at the end of play, yet by asking for it at the beginning, it left me feeling rather strange to see him hungering so viciously after Bassanio's heart.  By the end of the film, I wasn't sure what to feel about any of the players.  Shylock is played as either pitious or villainous, and though either trait can exhibit subtleties of the other, it's impossible to be both at the same time.

This is not to say that the movie does have redeeming qualities, and I would certainly not say that it should not be seen.  Lynn Collins (Portia) is as beautiful as to role requires and as gracious.  The scenery and sets are marvelous and the ambient music is done very nicely.  The scenes with Morocco and especially Aragon are outrageously funny and courtroom scene towards the end of the film is delightfully intense.

Enjoy the film but keep in mind that the roles can be played differently and better, as with the Olivier production, and that a great deal of lines have been cut.",1117670400,10,3650,4.875202593192869
2247414,1,B0007WRT4Q,"As an actor, Al Pacino comprehends a fairly narrow subset of humanity:  thugs, mobsters, hustlers, operators, anyone conversant with the modern American street.  He has little or no affinity for patricians, intellectuals, the cultivated, the well-spoken, or people from other times and other countries.  This makes him a disastrous Shakespearean, as his Richard III so wincingly confirmed.  Shylock might seem more promising, a resident of the ghetto with an earthier argot; and didn't Dusty do it not so long ago?  But the 400 year-old idiom and a welter of other strangenesses stand between Pacino and the character, blocking empathy and simple understanding.  He accordingly does what any actor in his situation would do.  He withdraws into himself and gives a shy, subdued performance, hoping that muted incompetence will pass for restraint.

Pacino spends much of the film in a state of apparent exhaustion, trudging from scene to scene with his eyelids half-open.  His voice never rises above a gravelly murmur.  With Jessica he shows neither sternness nor tenderness, only somnolence.  His initial scene is impenetrable:  why does this notorious usurer forgo interest in favor of a pound of worthless flesh?  To appease the Christians with a ""merry bond""?  Or to tickle his vindictivenss with the mere possibility of killing Antonio?  The first choice will work only if one cuts Shylock's earlier vow to ""feed fat his ancient grudge"" against Antonio if he ever gets the chance--a cut which this politically correct film predictably makes.  The second choice is the one Shakespeare intended.  Yet remarkably, Pacino plays neither, his droopy-eyed fatigue conveying no glimmer of hatred or hope for acceptance.  At times he comes fleetingly to half-life, only to relapse into insomniac depletion.  ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" is gruff rather than furious or anguished; he is offhand rather than impassioned in the Jailer scene; and his demeanor at the trial is moody.  We must assume that Shylock is motivated throughout by nothing more than weary resignation.

Some critics have dubbed Pacino an accomplished verse-speaker.  Since he has played only two other Shakespearean roles in a 40-year career overwhelmingly skewed towards contemporary semi-literates, this would be amazing if true.  In fact, Pacino speaks terribly, his discomfort with the language manifest in his abashed muttering, and in a hesitant, halting, word-by-word delivery maintained from beginning to end.  Could this be dialectal, the alien Jew negotiating a foreign tongue?  No, because Pacino uses the same plodding diction with Jessica and Tubal.  (Ignorance has a hard time masquerading as characterization).  Phony Britishness causes him to pronounce ""lord"" as ""lohrd;"" when mingled with the strains of his native Bronx, it changes terminal-r words into earsores or rather ee-ah-saws.  His mumbling articulation can have a truncating effect, as when ""tourquoise"" is lopped into ""tourquoi"" and ""better the instruction"" into ""bet the instruction.""  The foreign language is Shakespeare, and Pacino is the hapless negotiator.

Hollywood stars rarely distinguish themselves when they tackle the Bard, and Al Pacino is no exception.  His whispery, tentative and amateurish Shylock is a monument to nothing but his own inexperience.",1117670400,11,3302,5.440944881889764
2247415,5,B0007WRT4Q,"This is Shakespeare written and acted for film, not for a stage audience. Many of the ""pure"" Shakespeare critics miss this important point and pretend that they are sitting in the Star theatre watching the ""the play."" As film it is not expected that all of the original scenes be shown, nor should the modern era film watcher be subjected to antiquated English language. Rather, like most films, this is Richard for the masses and in that light it is masterfully done. Film is after all an art medium in its own right and therefore subject to its own standards.

There are three determining scenes of note, almost all with Shylock: the contracting of the bond scene, the Shylock soliloquy and the trial scene. Al Pacino is masterful and the filming of the soliloquy in its entirety with one shot increases the forcefulness of one of Shakespeare's finest moments. Lynn Collins and Pacino's interaction during the trail was spell binding and resulted in the need for constant re-runs of the film to continuously enjoy the magic of the acting skills demonstrated--a feat not possible in the theatre. Radford's interpretation of the ending and Shylock's exclusion from the synagogue is realistically supported as probably the most disingenuous act taken against Shylock. It was the death of the soul of the man ending with the fishing scene and foreshadowed by Shylock's answered to ""What good (taking the flesh) is that for."" Shylock answers, ""to bait fish with."" So now who are the fishermen shooting arrows at if not the Jews who were thrown in the river during the first scene, and though he did not view himself as one of those so treated-until now-Shylock experienced the same fate-until now.

This was a difficult movie to make and it was well done.",1117584000,5,1752,4.8561872909699
2247416,4,B0007WRT4Q,"This is, generally, a very satisfying filming of a very problematic play.  Director Radford, who also adapted the screenplay, deserves credit for his bold choices in casting and for his not shying away from some of the more troublesome aspects of the text.  Is Pacino a successful Shylock?  I think so, although by way of Brooklyn.  He is especially powerful in the famous courtroom scene, which otherwise comes dangerously close to being exploitative on the screen.  There is much to recommend here, including a stellar supporting cast.  Few actors can hold their own next to Pacino, but Lynn Collins comes close.  After an unfortunate entrance as the young lawyer (she looks uncomfortably like Sonny Chiba), Collins makes us forget the incongruities in her role and attend, instead, to Portia's masterful polemics.  The quality of makeup is not strained!  (Collins, by the way, is an actress from Texas, but this does not become an issue.  She has been linked romantically with Keanu Reeves, her costar in ""Il Mare.""  Perhaps these two will at some point treat us to a film of ""Anthony and Cleopatra""?--another of Shakespeare's plays that has been criminally neglected by Hollywood.)  Other actors worthy of mention are MacKenzie Crook and Ron Cook as the younger and older Gobbos, and Kris Marshall and John Sessions as Gratiano and Salerio.  Heather (""Kinsey"") Goldenhersh as Nerissa and Allan Corduner as Tubal are also fine.  Several up-and-coming young actors appear in supporting roles, including Tony Schiena, Julian Nest, and Tom Leick, who is soon to be seen in ""House of Boys,"" with a screenplay by J.T. LeRoy.

I have given the film 4 stars, but I would like to give the DVD itself 5. Watching the film, I had many questions for the director--for instance, why are certain scenes deleted, while others are out of sequence?--and I'm happy to say that most all of these are answered in the delightful director's commentary, for which Michael Radford is joined by Lynn Collins.  I learned a lot about the rationale behind certain casting and directorial choices and came to appreciate the film itself better as a result.  For example, the director has choreographed certain scenes to reflect a love triangle among Antonio, Portia, and Bassanio, something that is heavily debated in Shakespearan criticism.  Radford even gives us a rationale for his having asked the actresses playing prostitutes to appear with their breasts exposed!  See this film, certainly; it has many qualities to recommend it, not the least of which are a lovely soundtrack by Jocelyn Pook and location filming in both Venice and Luxemburg.  But, to get the whole experience, see it on DVD and then watch the director's commentary.",1117152000,4,2714,5.042600896860987

2247418,3,B0007WRT4Q,"Shakespeare's lines will carry any movie above the waterline, and the same can be said of Pacino's acting. They both make this movie presentable and even excellent at times. However, the angle of the movie seems to be one of contradiction to the text, beginning with the introductory text prior to the film's dialogue (text from the Director NOT Shakespeare). This text attempts to excuse the very play itself for its characterization of Christians and the Jew, Shylock. If the play needed an intro, Shakespeare would have written a prologue. It certainly works to bias the audience in a way. The other attempt to do this is several scenes where the ""Christian"" characters are carousing in a bawdy house with a bunch of half-naked prostitutes. Clearly, the director attempts to make a martyr of Shylock and hypocrites of all the non-Jew characters: however Shakespeare's text is what it is. The nudity is utterly unnecessary and detracts from the integrity of the play--plus it cannot now be shown to young people.

Other than those detractions, I think the film is excellent. The trial scene is superb and brings the tension of the moment to life. Besides Pacino the other actors do a fine job. Unfortunately, though I am a lover of Shakespeare, I would not want to watch this again.

2247419,3,B0007WRT4Q,"While this film is a relatively accurate and well acted version of the Shakespeare play, it has nudity in it where none is called for. This makes it unusable in the American classroom and cheapens the play itself.",1116979200,8,213,4.631578947368421
2247420,4,B0007WRT4Q,"This is an outstanding production of the one work of Shakespeare that is the most difficult to like.  It is impossible to get around the anti-Semitism.  This production tries very hard to put the anti-Semitism in context and I think to tone it down, but in the end it is impossible to eliminate it.  To some extent Shylock is being punished for being vindictive and not showing mercy, but it is impossible to ignore that in the end the play seems to celebrate Shylock's foced conversion to Christianity.

Al Pacino's performance is disconcerting as he seems to be playing Shylock with a New Yawk accent.  But Lynne Collins is truly oustanding as Portia.  This version of Merchant really shines in the comic portion of the story where Portia masquerades as a man and successfully entreats Bassanio to give up his wedding ring (which he had earlier promised Portia he would never part with).  This is one of the few Shakespearean productions I have seen where a woman masquerading as a man is actually credible.

The settings, costumes, and photography are all spectacular.  I found I was able to focus on the positive elements and not get bogged down with the more distressing parts of the plot.  But I sympathize with those who find the anti-Semitic aspects of the story too distressing.",1116806400,3,1287,4.782805429864253
2247431,5,B0007WRT4Q,"In 1596 in Venice, the decadent center of European culture, a young nobleman named Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) has a plan to pay off his debts and find happiness in love at the same time. He wishes to marry wealthy young Portia (Lynn Collins), whose deceased father has dictated the method by which she will find a husband. There is to be a contest. Potential suitors must choose between three caskets: a gold, a silver, and a lead box, each inscribed with a riddle. The man who chooses correctly will have Portia's hand in marriage. Bassanio asks his friend and mentor, the wealthy merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons), for a loan to finance his trip to Portia. But Antonio has no cash on hand, so he offers to guarantee a loan for his friend from a Jewish usurer named Shylock. Embittered by his ill-treatment at the hands of gentiles, Shylock (Al Pacino) agrees to the loan -on the condition that Antonio guarantee it with a pound of his own flesh if the 3,000 ducats are not paid in three months.

""The Merchant of Venice"" is two stories loosely bound into one by some common characters and themes. There is the tragedy of Shylock and the romantic comedy of Bassanio and Portia. Characters cross between the two, but it is difficult to bridge the stories to the extent that they seem to be one. In a sense, Shylock's story demonstrates what happens when people hang onto their hatred, while Portia's story shows what happens when they don't. But that is, I think, as close as anyone is going to come to overcoming the binary nature of this play. Widely held opinion seems to be that ""The Merchant of Venice"" is difficult to adapt in this day and age on account of its unflattering Renaissance stereotype of Jews in the form of Shylock. I think the difficulty is found in the other story: Portia's motives are barely comprehensible and never clear. Bassanio and Portia's story is amusing enough, but it is a bit of a muddle at times. Lynn Collins does a wonderful job with Portia, though.

The idea that ""The Merchant of Venice"" is anti-Jewish apparently comes from Shakespeare's exploitation a Jewish stereotype for dramatic purposes, not from the substance of the play. ""The Merchant of Venice"" is an indictment of religious and ethnic persecution that portrays gentiles as self-indulgent hypocrites. But where the play is sympathetic to Jews and minorities in general, it is not sympathetic to Shylock in particular. Some people will disagree with me on that point. But Shylock is one of Shakespeare's great tragic characters, and, as such, he is more a victim of his own flaws than of external forces. He is a flawed man living in a flawed society that amplifies his imperfection. ""The villainy you teach me, I will execute,"" Shylock says. And in doing so, he brings everyone's faults to light. To say that Shylock is merely reacting to a lifetime of mistreatment would do Shakespeare and Shylock a disservice, though. If he were not fully in control of his actions, the play would have no point.

This film's great strength is the courtroom scene in which Shylock and Antonio  appear before the Duke to find out if he will enforce the bond that requires Antonio to sacrifice a pound of his person. Kudos to director Michael Radford for not copping out in this scene. I have sometimes seen it staged like an intellectual exercise instead of the clash of passions that it is. Radford plays the potential for violence for all it's worth, and it works brilliantly. Even viewers who know the outcome will wonder if Antonio is going to be eviscerated before our eyes. Al Pacino plays this scene perfectly straight and sober. I would give ""The Merchant of Venice"" five stars based on the courtroom scene alone.

""The Merchant of Venice"" had something for everyone 5 centuries ago, and it's a testament to Shakespeare's talent that it still does. There is love, a beautiful young woman, and an undeniably funny challenge for her suitors. And there are hatred, bigotry, and one of Shakespeare's most complex and affecting characters. Director Michael Radford, a terrific cast and Benoit Delhomme's lovely cinematography bring it to life.

The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): Bonus features include a documentary, a DVD-ROM, and an audio commentary. ""The Merchant of Venice: Shakespeare through the Lens"" (30  minutes) consists mostly of interviews with director Michael Radford and the cast in which they discuss characters, themes, and compare the media of theater and film. The DVD-ROM provides a web link to a Teacher's Guide. The audio commentary features director Michael Radford and actress Lynn Collins, who discuss shooting the film in Venice and Luxembourg. Radford talks about historical details, locations, characters, story, and his decisions. Collins talks about her experiences while filming and her reaction to seeing the film. The commentary has very few lulls, and is pretty interesting if you want to find out more about this interpretation of the play. Subtitles are available for the film in French.",1116201600,25,5016,4.908018867924528
2247432,5,B0007WRT4Q,"The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare. I really like this movie.  It is a very good adaptation of a difficult play.  I especially liked Lynn Collins Portia.  Al Pacino as Shylock, Jeremy Irons as Antonio, and Joseph Fiennes as Bassanio.

If you wish to see this movie I would buy or rent it on DVD.  My reasons for saying this are as follows: 1.)  For the television version Michael Radford has been asked to light box out the wallpaper.  (Which actually is the multi-million dollar frescos which are painted on the walls.)  2.)  To get rid of the pound of flesh.  (As it might be offensive to some people.)  3.) To get rid of the kiss between Jeremy Irons and Joseph Fiennes and also the one between the ladies. (As it might be offensive to some people.)  You can hear all this, and more if you listen to the commentary.

 All I am saying is that if you wish to see the film as it was meant to be seen you had better purchase or rent the DVD before the censors get a hold of it, and start telling the American public what we have right to see.  There are still a few of us out here who have enough of a brain in our heads to decide what we have the right to see.  If we wished to see this version of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice uncut we the American public should have the right to do so.  I hope you agree.

To the reviewer who didn't understand the last scene of the movie.  The scene meant to show the importance of Jessica's ring, which she did not give away.  The part of Jessica was played by Zuleikha Robinson.  This information can also be found by viewing the commentary.",1116115200,6,1594,4.229235880398671
2247433,4,B0007WRT4Q,"I had never seen ""The Merchant of Venice"" performed before this 2004 film version by director Michael Radford.  Portia's speech on how ""The quality of mercy is not strained"" is one of Shakespeare's most famous, but the context in which it is delivered in this play is not as well known.  Portia says these famous words to Shylock, a moneylender who demands Antonio pay a pound of flesh for forfeiting his bond, and it is Shylock who is the problematic character for performing this Shakespeare play today.  Shylock is a Jew and the anti-Semitism of the time that is reflected in the play makes the character fraught with pitfalls in a post-Holocaust world.  But Shylock is a Shakespearean character, which means he is fully developed just like the other characters in the play.  As he says in his most famous speech when he complains about the prejudice he faces as a Jew: ""If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?""  That is what is at the heart of this play.

Or rather, of one part of the play, for ""The Merchant of Venice"" is really two plays in one.  The deal that Shylock (Al Pacino) has struck with Antonio (Jeremy Irons) and it conclusion in court before the Doge of Venice is the more dramatic plotline and if it had developed differently in the end it would make the play a tragedy.  But the other plotline has is much more of a romantic comedy.  Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) wants to wed the fair Portia (Lynn Collins), but her husband will be determined by her suitors being shown caskets of gold, silver, and lead from which to choose.  The more lofty suitors make the wrong choice and leave the correct choice to the young Bassanio.  But Portia's new husband needs to be taught a lesson when he supports Antonio in his hour of need, so she dressed up as a man and appears in court to resolve the situation with Shylock.

Portia is clearly the most intelligent of Shakespeare's women, as she amply proves in the courtroom scene where her knowledge of the law allows her to save the day by outfoxing Shylock.  But all characters become secondary to Shylock in this play, especially as portrayed by Pacino.  He has been called a dog by Antonio (before he serves it, he notes) and in court this dog is going to have his day.  The construction of the story is such that Antonio is a fitting target for Shylock's wrath.  After all, Antonio has spit at Shylock, and while he is seeking to borrow money from the Jew readily admits that he will spit at the moneylender again.  The Greek tragic poets would know full well that Antonio will be punished by the gods, but the Venetians in this play and the Elizabethan audience watching it would never stomach him being punished by a Jew.

However, as his examination by Portia proves, Shylock's crime is not that he is a Jew but rather than he refuses to show mercy.  Portia and others give him several opportunities to walk away with not only the money owed him but much more, but Shylock wants his pound of flesh.  Shakespeare's story involves a series of misfortunes that befall Shylock that justify his enmity towards Antonio.  If it were not for the fact that he wants to remove a pound of flesh from a living human being, our sympathies would be with Shylock's case and indeed the only flaw in his cause is that he demands what is promised in his bond (you can even make the argument that Shylock violates the extant stereotype in that he would take the pound of flesh over thousands of ducats).

This is one of Pacino's best performances and his Shylock is a strong character who will not be the supplicant even though he is considered less than a citizen of Venice.  The film does not ignore the anti-Semitism but addresses it head on at the beginning as we are given the facts of how the Jews of Venice were treated in the 16th century.  When he gives his famous speech Shylock has moral outrage to feed his anger, but when he appears in court he has a legal leg to stand on and he takes full advantage of it to give a lot better than he is getting until Portia finally springs her legal trap.  The other key performance is that of Irons, because he is the one during the scene before the Doge who brings home the horror of what is being discussed in coldly legal terms.  Even if his is spared his fate, Antonio is put through the wringer.

The problem with ""William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice"" belongs to the bard and neither the director nor the cast.  The simple fact is that the climax of this story comes in Act IV with Portia and Shylock in court.  Act V, where Portia and Nerissa (Heather Goldenhersh) make Bassanio and Gratiano (Kris Marshall) jump through some hoops trying to explain away their behavior is not that impressive after Shylock is denied his pound of flesh.  There were problems making the two plotlines mesh in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" as well, but at least there Shakespeare ended with the stronger one of the pair and that is just not the case here.",1116028800,6,5047,4.459194776931447
2247434,1,B0007WRT4Q,"I felt this movie was an absolute insult to Shakespeare's excellent play. When I read the play, I felt it was an excellent piece of writing. Going into the movie, I was excited to see what Al Pacino would bring to the role of Shylock. I feel he failed in this.  Pacino just didn't portray Shylock with the emotion I saw in the original play.

The people responsible for the editing also deserve some of the blame for this movie. Scenes such as the discussion between Gobba and Launcelot were deleted, and scenes with pointless nudity were added. The much-anticipated kiss between Antonio and Bassanio served no purpose. The kiss between Portia and Nerissa was just as pointless.

I will admit, the way the movie was filmed was excellent. The way the movie was filmed added a lot to the play.  The darker lighting served to give a darker mood to the movie, at least in the theatre.

The characters were also changed slightly. The audience was meant to sympathise with Shylock's point of view. Portia's character was well played in my opinion. The trial scene was extremely well written.  On the other hand, Jessica, Shylocks daughter, was almost forgotten.

The end of the movie was quite confusing. I have no idea where the idea for the final scene came from. Fishing with a bow and arrow was never mentioned in the play. Had they just left off with the excellent scene of Shylock in the ghetto, it would have been infinitely better.

As it was, the movie was an insult to the play.",1115942400,18,1482,4.587121212121212
2247435,3,B0007WRT4Q,"The original play of The Merchant of Venice was one of Shakespeare's best plays, and definitely his most controversial.  The film, on the other hand, simply follows in the controversy.  Portraying Antonio as gay, and removing parts of the text are primary faults.  One of the few things holding this movie together was the performance of Al Pacino.  Perhaps not best suited for the film, Pacino gave his all.

The acting of others in the movie was in parts excellent, yet vague in others.

Pacino does not play Shylock in the way I had envisioned, as he plays the character with less hatred than in the play, up until Jessica robs him, where his hatred comes off quite strong and escalates from then on, beyond what I would have expected.

Certain parts of the play were removed, possibly to simplify it for the general public, but most likely to keep a respectable running time.  Portions of each character's monologues have been removed.  In some cases this is understandable, but, when it comes to Shylock and Bassanio, this is unforgivable; the parts that were removed added something to the play, that made it special.

Though not a complaint, there was an addition of unnecessary nudity in what seemed like over half of the scenes involving Venice.  This paints a picture of Venice that may have been true to the times, where due to the market setting, everything was for sale.  It was most likely to provide a drastic contrast between the two main settings, Venice being a dirty market city, and Belmont being a beautifully clean and rich estate setting.  I believe that this was done mainly to appeal to the masses, in order to A) profit, and B) introduce new people to the world of Shakespeare.

As the audience, we are meant to like Portia, as she, essentially, single-handedly saves Antonio.  There are some scenes in which the director possibly mistakenly makes Portia seem less than respectful, yet more human.  This comes from her prejudiced opinions voiced throughout the film.

At the very beginning of the film, Antonio spits on Shylock, invoking sympathy and pity for Shylock.  Later on, Shylock's actions and hatred change this view to that of dislike and perhaps even loathing.  This mindset ends during his humiliation in the court scene. The feeling, at that point, reverts back to sympathy and pity, as he is forced to give up all his wealth at the time of his death, and become a Christian (thus, in his Jewish beliefs, sending him to hell).  He then becomes ostracized and outcast from his own people.

All in all, due to the changes in the transition from stage to film, I came away from The Merchant of Venice rather disappointed, feeling that only the settings and the performance of Al Pacino kept this modern rendition of a Shakespearean masterpiece afloat.",1115942400,4,2787,4.7887029288702925

The way the camera work was done was spectacular along with Al Pacino's performance as Shylock. This is unfortunate, however, because it is over looked. They could have been better viewed if this move was not so boring and a terrible disappointment to Shakespearean fans. There were many scenes completely deleted out of this movie, whether for time purposes or to completely boggle Shakespeare fans I do not know. Many lines were altered, deleted, or added. There were nudity scenes that were completely random and ashamed a lot of Shakespearean fans. The nudity in this movie took away from the glorious words of Shakespeare. As for the rumour of Antonio being portrayed as gay, that was false. There were some hints, but nothing of much importance that would hint to such a thing, unless Bassanio was also gay. There was a guy to guy kiss scene that everyone watching had a very negative reaction to, but I want to make something aware to everyone reading this review, that is how men acted back then in Italy. I believe this is not a sign of men being homosexual but a sign of friendship. I believe that this movie was a terrible way to portray this play, there were scenes that could have been better acted and portrayed.

2247437,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Of all of the thankfully increasing number of adaptations of the plays of William Shakespeare for the screen MERCHANT OF VENICE is surely the finest. MERCHANT is one of the more difficult of Shakespeare's play, the subject matter of Christians vs. Jews and the demands on the actors to create sympathetic characters from roles inherently unsympathetic, etc.  But it has also some of the most eloquent writing with many extant usable quotes in Shakespeare's entire repertoire.  For this viewer Michael Radford's adaptation resolves all of these problems and attributes and has created a story that flows sensibly and gracefully and intelligently all bathed in the stunningly atmospheric mists and molds of the vulnerable Serenissma - Venice.

Antonio the Merchant (Jeremy Irons) has devoted his successful life to his business as a trader but is entering his later years in need of love, a desire that he finds gratified in the company of young noblemen, namely Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), a young man who loves Antonio but seeks his fortune and the hand of the infamously beautiful Portia (a breathtaking Lynn Collins) who waits in Belmont for the solver of the riddles of the three caskets her late father determined would elect the proper husband for his daughter. Bassanio is an extravagant youth and has squandered his money for pleasures.  In order to court Portia he must have wealth and he turns to his benefactor for funds. Though Antonio's wealth is tied up in ships at sea, his love for Bassanio outweighs his judgment and he sends Bassanio out into the streets of Venice to borrow money using Antonio's good name.

Shylock (Al Pacino in his finest role to date), a Jewish usurer in the Venetian Jewish ghetto, is recently a widower whose only joy in life is his daughter Jessica (Zuleikha Robinson) who is secretly in love with a Christian Lorenzo (Charlie Cox), and his money gathered from his fame in usury.  Shylock has been humiliated in public by Antonio (the film opens with a fine history of Venice and its social problems in 1576 and with Antonio spitting on Shylock in a memorable moment of facial acting by Pacino) and when Bassanio approaches him for a loan of 3000 ducats in Antonio's name, Shylock's business mind and revengeful heart agree to the loan with the ominous bond that should the monies not be repaid with interest in the allotted time, then Antonio would give Shylock the famous pound of flesh.

Antonio agrees to the bond and sends Bassanio off to court Portia, a journey that leads him to select the correct casket and win Portia's hand.  But when Antonio's ships fail to return with treasure to Venice, the loan falls due and Shylock demands his pound of flesh.  Wealthy and intelligent and well-motivated Portia disguises herself as a lawyer and adjudicates the case before the Duke of Venice.  In this famous courtroom drama Portia delivers the Quality of Mercy speech and makes it ring true with the audience - except for poor Shylock who is defeated by the expertise of the 'law' quoted by Portia.  Antonio is saved, Shylock is destroyed: not only has he lost his revenge, he has also lost his daughter to Lorenzo and further humiliated by his portion of his fortune being ceded to Jessica and Lorenzo in a Christian union.  The scenes that conclude the play involve reiteration of love and commitments between Bassanio and the revealed disguise of Portia,  and Antonio.

The cast is absolutely extraordinary!  Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes, Al Pacino and Lynn Collins deliver their lines melodically, capturing Shakespeare's magic while holding the characters wholly credible and natural.  Pacino's Shylock will be the gold standard for this tough role: he plumbs the humanity of this dark figure and brings him to a completely understandable and quite sympathetic man.  The find of the film is the brilliance of Lynn Collins' Portia.  Here is an American actress (born in 1979 in Texas) who is declared by the director in the DVD commentary to be the finest Shakespearean actress on the stage today.  She is Beautiful, subtle, sensitive, intelligent, and makes Portia (Shakespeare's most intelligent female character) come vividly to life.

Cinematographer Benot Delhomme  visually explores Venice and finds more beauty and atmosphere than any other colleague.  The audacious costumes (most women's dresses recreate the definition of d&eacute;colletage!) are period perfect, sumptuous creations by Sammy Sheldon and the hauntingly beautiful score is by Jocelyn Pook.  But the kudos for all of these pale in the masterfully adapted and directed work by Michael Radford.  This is simply on of the finest films in recent memory.  A resounding Bravo!

2247438,3,B0007WRT4Q,"I can't say I know Shakespeare very well, certainly never knew ""The Merchant of Venice"", (which I would have guessed was one of his lighter comedies), so I was unprepared for the difficulty in digesting this Jew vs. Christian drama which simply smacks of anti-semitism, despite it's lofty and high minded ideals. The sight of a Jewish man merely, albeit outrageously securing the conditions of a debt in a court of law and being threatened, nearly condemned to death, and reduced to a Rumplestilskin-like troll under a bridge, by a person posing as an influential leader, who holds a tremendous bias in the outcome of the case, is a discomforting and ugly situation. The film was only wavering with cinematic interest until this bombshell dropped; ellaborate settings and costumes, immaculate acting, well plotted conflict, musical score by Jocelyn Pook, (""Eyes Wide Shut""), but what is it we're supposed to learn about the merchant of Venice? That in order to learn the sanctity of forgiveness, he needs to become a Christian? Here is a comedy with a very cynical laugh, a tragedy where no one dies. Assuming this is an accurate vision of the essence of the play, the old man wasn't so far removed from his own generation's fears and prejudices.",1115769600,,1246,4.909952606635071
2247439,4,B0007WRT4Q,"It would be impossible to produce a definitive version of this : the most complex and difficult of Shakespeare's comedies.

Too much emphasis has been placed on the interpretation of Shylock, and that is a pity because he is only one of five or six irresistable characters who live and breathe here.

Lynn Collin's Portia will be a revelation to those who have never seen the play or know it by heart.  She is a physical actress who says as much with body language and canny eye -work as she does with her superb recitation of some of Shakespeare's most wrenching monologues.

With the exception of Al Pacino's frequent excesses, and his moving to and fro between a Brooklyn accent and one less clearly defined, this film is a great ensemble piece, with cinematography and a score that are to die for.

Never before on tape or film have I left this play as motivated to think about its disturbing, universal themes.  Never before, live or on any recording, have I revered the laanguage of this playwright as much as I do after viewing this movie, now for the third time.  Never have the many glorious minor roles in this play seemed so significant.

If you love Shakespeare, please take time out to enjoy it. It's a bargain at this price, but would be a bargain at ten times the price.  Spend time with this remarkable film, warts and all, and you will not regret it.",1115769600,3,1367,4.524390243902439

2247452,3,B0007WRT4Q,"The most important lesson we can learn from this film is that you shouldn't kick somebody and then ask for a favor.  Of  course this being Shakespeare we all know that everything will go wrong and in the end primarily evil and despair will prevail.  It goes without saying that Shakespeare is one of Murphy's Law's biggest fans.  The reason I am recommending this film is mostly because of the great trail scene which happens near the end of the film.  There Pacino is allowed to shine and Shakespeare's high drama is given a worthy adaptation.  Michael Radford, having the luxury of jump cuts and sound effects is able to produce a very effective scene that will have most on the edge of their seats.  Of course not all is rainbows and butterflies when it comes to filming Shakespeare.  Many lines are provided only for the audience and are spoken off to the side and supposedly heard by none of the other characters.  These lines are mostly ignored by Radford, and when they are not they should've been.  It will make your stomach turn to see the way that the Christians hold court session.  These courts are built upon some of the shakiest laws ever dreamt up.  It also shows how hatred is all fun and games when it involves spitting on a Jew, but not when he wants to extract his revenge.  The set design here is also beautiful.  The downside to this film is that I'm not sure they do the best job with the build up to the court scene.  Is the extended time necessary for Portia to hold her love lottery? I would say probably not. The language is also a barrier anytime you watch or read Shakespeare and it took me a little longer than I would have liked to settle into it. However, I am still recommending this film, especially for fans of Shakespeare.  ***1/4",1111190400,7,1765,4.451713395638629
2247453,5,B0007WRT4Q,"I eagerly attended a showing of this film, curious to see how Pacino would handle the role of Shylock the Jew.  Having read the Shakespeare play several times in college, I was familiar with the story and was pleased to see that this adaptation of Merchant didn't ""dumb down"" the Shakespearian language.  As for Pacino, I thought he did a great job bringing Shylock to life on screen, even if he did lose his accent a few times, which I found somewhat distracting.  Fans of Shakespearian literature will find this an agreeable film.",1111190400,12,532,4.698924731182796
2247454,4,B0007WRT4Q,"THere's much to be said for the production of this Shakespeare play, not least of which is Al Pacino's brilliant performance as Shylock, who's really the soul of this play.  In fact, the title ambiguously refers to both (or either) him and/or Antonio, a ""real"" merchant.  The term ""real"" is in quotes because Shylock is Jewish and in Renaissance Venice--we are told in a scrolling text prologue to the film--Jews were treated as second-class citizens, thus one of the few ways they had to make a living was by usury or money lending at interest.

Shylock is one such money lender, and Antonio turns to him for help--actually to help his friend Bassanio who wishes to woo a fair maiden and needs the funds to do so.  Antonio, nobly acquitted by Jeremy Irons, is a man who on one hand spits on Shylock (near the beginning of the film) and on the other is more than generous to his friend, Bassanio.  The latter, played by Joseph Fiennes--and quite well, too--is a bit pompous, but not overly so.  Near the end we see how true his heart really is when he does everything he can to save Antonio.

Interestingly enough the entire cast is British except for Pacino and he is the one who gives this great piece of cinema its spirit, its energy, its momentum.  It's really tough to think of the last time he put in as smashing a performance as he does here. This is not a role in which he spouts bombasically as he unfortunately has been given to do in a number of roles.  It's one in which he has adopted an interesting speech pattern and uses it so nimbly that it is an integral part of his entire persona.  When he roars, or cries, or hurls invective, we are riveted to the screen.  He carries this film as he has no other in a long, long time.

The only weak spot, unfortunately, is Lynn Collins who plays Portia, the fair maiden whom Bassanio woos.  When she delivers the justly famous ""The quality of mercy"" soliloquy, it is as though we can hardly feel the speech, as though the raindrops alluded to in the soliloquy itself are invisible ones that leave no trace.  She looks right for the part, no question.  But her acting is just not up to the role.

Pacino, Fiennes, and Irons are the pillars of the film, and, I would say, in that order.  Fiennes has never been better than he is here and in Irons one can sense his weakness--spitting in Shylock's face--and at the same time, paradoxically, his strength of character.

The production and set designs are a marvel to behold.  The director, Michael Radford, has taken great and wonderful pains to insure that the look of the film is truly redolent of Renaissance Italy--and it most certainly is.  This is, as many have said, sumptuous indeed.

The supporting cast does a fine job in the roles of Lorenzo (Jessica's lover), Jessica (Shylock's daughter), Nerissa (Portia's maid), and several others.

The only reason this is not a five star review is because of Lynn Collins.  Had her acting been more substantial, a five star rating would have been a no-brainer.  The reason to see the film is the spectacular set design, Pacino's terrific performance, and the intelligent interpretation of the play by the director Michael Radford who makes no bones about the anti-Semitism that was part of the culture, but still manages to fuse this powerful theme with a love story and with a story of revenge and its consequences.

Definitely recommended, in spite of the Lynn Collins performance.",1110672000,11,3435,4.600985221674877
2247455,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Though I love Shakespeare, I am not a student of his work. So, any movie based on his work has to telegraph visually what I cannot pick up verbally. ""Merchant of Venice"" is admirable on this level. My Elizabethan ear occasionally failed me, but I missed very little of the thrust of the play.

The entire cast was absolutely wonderful. Al Pacino was masterful as Shylock, the outraged Jewish moneylender who took his one shot for revenge at a lifetime of slights.

Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Antonio was low-key, anguished and subtle. The rest of the cast was superb, especially Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins as the lovers Bassanio and Portia. The film deals delicately with the themes of revenge, anti-Semitism and honor. Director Michael Radford went to lengths to show Shylock as a man humiliated by injustices and slights. Shylock's twisted malice was portrayed not as a necessary consequence of his religion, but to a  lifetime of swallowed pride, threats and abuse at the hands of the Christian majority. The play's denouement, probably satisfying to 16th-century audiences, was positively painful in the 21st. Still, that Shakespeare bothered to raise the issues of anti-Jewish feelings so long ago, and managed to criticize his peers in a successful play, was no mean feat.

""Merchant of Venice"" is a master interpretation, true to its original, contrasting pageantry, sweet music and soaring beauty with forced religious conversion, arranged marriages and ethnic hatred. The film will have you pondering the characters' motives and logic long after the screen goes dark.",1110240000,15,1581,5.1640625
2247456,5,B0007WRT4Q,"More and more Shakespeare plays are getting made into good movies-- certainly a fine way for more people to become familiar with more of the bard's works-- and Michael Radford's THE MERCHANT OF VENICE measures up, for the most part. From the beginning, it has a lot going for it: Much of it is filmed in that most beautiful of cities, Venice. It's impossible to make a visually unappealing film set in that city. The scenes of both Venice and the canals are stunning. And the first time Lynn Collins as Portia appears on-screen, she could have been lit by Vermeer, she is so beautifully backlit. She is part of a fine cast headed up by Al Pacino, who is outstanding as Shylock, along with Jeremy Irons and Joseph Fiennes. Finally in addition to beautiful cinematography and a stellar cast, the text obviously is by the greatest writer in English.

Of course one of the problems, as always, that this production has to deal with is anti-semitism. Radord attempts to do that by telling us with written text at the beginning of the movie that in 1596 in Venice that Jews were despised by Christians (sadly some still are), that they had to wear red hats-- as does Pacino-- when they went out during the day, that they lived in a ghetto and were locked up at night. Given that, Pacino for me generated a lot of sympathy and plays his part with a great deal of sensitivity. Also, sometimes the dialogue was hard to follow and the movie was somewhat slow in the beginning. But the court scene where Portia gives her famous ""quality of mercy"" speech is tremendously moving and very, very well done.

Hats off to another Shakespeare play brought to the movies.",1109980800,6,1652,4.577702702702703
2247457,4,B0007WRT4Q,"Michael Radford, director of ""Il Postino,"" turns his attention to Shakespeare with his somewhat abbreviated version of ""The Merchant of Venice."" This production has much more right with it than wrong: By prefacing the story with the real-life, institutionalized anti-Semitism of Venice in 1596--including Antonio, at the time quite without reason, spitting in Shylock's face--Radford provides the motivations for Shylock's blood-lust in a way the stage never can. (Radford also seeks to ""epater les bourgeois"" early on in the film, with bare-breasted whores, a close-up of a lamb being slaughtered, and a very strong suggestion that Antonio and Bassanio's relationship is homosexual.) The film looks impeccable, thanks to the dark, rich production design of Jon Bunker and the even darker and richer cinematography of Benoit Delhomme. And as Shylock and Antonio, Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons cannot be faulted. Eschewing his recent tendencies to ham it up, Pacino exhibits a controlled rage worthy of Michael Corleone. Irons is the first Antonio I've ever seen who made me feel that character's humanity--his anguish at his mortal peril, and the wild yet all-too-common contradiction between his benevolent gentility and his virulent bigotry. Yet for all this, Radford's version of ""Merchant"" for me just missed being a great cinematic adaptation of the Bard. ""Merchant"" is a notoriously difficult play, the director left trying to balance the dominant themes of anti-Semitism with the fairy-tale, comic side story of Portia and Bassanio's romance. Radford succeeds better than most, but though his abbreviations help the plot to move along, they do harm to the play's greatest asset--its poetry. Certainly he commits murder most foul by condensing Lorenzo's great soliloquy on music. For me, it's the most beautiful part of the play, indeed one of the most beautiful things Shakespeare ever wrote (certainly Ralph Vaughan Williams thought so when he set it, in its entirety, as ""Serenade to Music""). And the younger actors, though they're undeniably very good, simply didn't move me as much as Pacino or Irons. Not even Joseph Fiennes (who actually, famously played Will Shakespeare) or Lynn Collins, who has received the lion's share of the critical praise as Portia. She is certainly excellent, as well as a luminous beauty (splitting the difference between Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett), but she just didn't reach my heart the way Pacino and Irons did. So Radford's version of ""Merchant"" is good but not great, worth seeing but not quite a transcendent experience.",1109462400,8,2572,5.33743842364532
2247458,4,B0007WRT4Q,"I honestly can't say that I am a fan of Shakespeare. I had my fill of Shakespeare in high school. Nevertheless when earlier this year I saw that there was a film adaptation of Shakespeare's most popular/well-known play ""The Merchant of Venice"", I thought it looked very intriguing. It also helped that Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons (two wonderful actors I don't see enough on the big screen lately) were in the film.

The story involves Joseph Fiennes as a young man Bassanio who wants to try to win the hand of the lovely Portia (played by the lovely Lynn Collins who bears an uncanny resemblence to Tori Amos). Unfortunately Bassanio has no money to make the trip to Portia's home. He seeks financial assistance from his friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons) but Antonio's money is stuck in his sea ventures. Antonio borrows money (3,000 ducats) from a Jewish money lender named Shylock (Al Pacino). The only drawback is if Antonio does not repay Shylock back in 3 months, Shylock will extract 3 pounds of flesh from Antonio. Things take a turn for the ugly when Shylock's daughter runs off with a Christian nobleman. Instead of wanting his 3,000 ducats back, Shylock is out for Christian blood in the form of his pound of flesh from Antonio.

I enjoyed this film immensely. Al Pacino put in a stirring performance as the bitter, vengeful yet sympathetic Shylock. Director Michael Radford does a great job explaining why Shylock wants vengence to a point where I felt sympathetic towards Shylock. Newcomer Lynn Collins was wonderful. Her performance as the beautiful Portia really stood out in this film for me. Her character was far more intelligent than what one would think in the beginning of the film. The costumes were gorgeous. I loved the film score which was very minimal and not overdramatic which often occurs in period films.

What I found a bit disturbing was the subject of anti-semiticism and the strong language used to describe Jews back in that time period however I will go as far as to say that I don't think this film is intentionally anti-semetic. There is even an intro in the film that states that during the time of the play that it was written that anti-semiticism was big. Nevertheless the strong performances from all the actors made this film very enjoyable to watch. Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons put in some of their best performances in years in this film.",1108771200,3,2376,4.74818401937046
2247459,5,B0007WRT4Q,"That's the big impression one comes away with, that Pacino did an outstanding job with a potentially difficult character. Even when he was off-screen, the movie seemed to revolve around him.

It helped that this presentation of Shylock was the most sympathetic I've see. He certainly had good reasons for his rage. It could have been different, though. This was not an anti-Semitic play, even though was founded on anti-Semitism.

The rest of the cast put in good performances as well. Jeremy Irons' Antonio was shown in a much more three-dimensional than is often the case, not just a stick figure used to get the play in motion. Lynn Collins' Portia was beautiful, and Zuleikha Robinson's Jessica had a bit more substance than I've seen before. Above all, the scenes and costuming were lush and beautiful.

One of Shakespeare's more improbable scenes was very well played, the one where Portia comes to court cross-dressed as a doctor of law. Bassanio would have had to be a bit thick not to recognize his own spouse, but the makeup artists here made the mistake almost credible.

This is a good, modern production of a script that can be read many ways. That complexity is why Merchant needs to be done and redone, to keep it fresh and true for each decade's audience. Pacino and all the rest have made it fresh again for today's viewer. I recommend this highly.

2247460,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Shakespeare's plays are full of the stuff of Humanity and Life: Love, Hate, Revenge, Death, Jealousy, etc. But very few of his plays have all of these. ""The Merchant of Venice"" (Il Mercante di Venezia) is one. And Michael Radford's film of ""TMOV"" is bubbling over, roiling and rocking with the Stuff of Life: though considered one of Shakespeare's comedies, this version is a very somber and dark reading of the play: a very, very dark comedy.
Anyone filming or staging a Shakespeare play is faced with a dilemma: What do I do about the Language? Radford has directed his actors to speak in a natural and conversational manner yet they do not forget to savor the beauty or ignore the eloquence of the Shakespearean verse.
Portia's ""The Quality of Mercy"" and Shylock's ""Pound of Flesh"" soliloquies and Lynn Collins' and Pacino's readings of them are breathtaking in their eloquence, delicate phrasing and common sense rationality: they continue to have real power...the power to move us.
Venice in the 1600's is ripe for drama what with the Jewish population locked up at night and forced to wear red caps when amongst the general population, so as to be recognized and of course, ridiculed. But Jews were allowed to lend money and though not allowed to, charged interest on this money. And out of this ugly, discriminatory milieu comes Shylock (Al Pacino), who lends 3,000 ducats to Antonio (Jeremy Irons) so that Antonio can lend them to Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), in essence so that Bassanio can marry the wealthy Portia (Lynn Collins).
Shakespeare characters are fully rounded individuals, neither all good or all bad: Antonio, though the essence of civility and nobility is also a slave profiteer and a bigot, Bassanio, though appearing to be a close friend of Antonio's thinks nothing of allowing his friend to enter into a dangerous loan agreement with Shylock and Shylock, though a third class citizen in Venice shows a great intellect and an all-consuming love of his daughter but ultimately loses sight of reason and mercy that makes him appear foolish and leads to his downfall. Shylock, as the oppressed is expected to exhibit nobility during the final scene that neither the court nor his oppressors would ever ask of one another. Shylock foolishly, though bravely expects justice from those who would segregate, taunt and revile him. This is strong, potent, dramatically viable stuff.
Shakespeare/Radford's ""The Merchant of Venice"" is a stunningly gorgeous and profound film made all the more important because it is so contemporary in feel, thought and more to the point, ambiguity. It is to Shakespeare and Radford's credit that a play written over 400 years ago can still have the unmitigated nerve to stick in our craw in a way few contemporary dramas can.",1108425600,38,2773,4.978448275862069
2247461,5,B0007WRT4Q,"Many through the centuries have accused ""The Merchant of Venice"" as being anti-semitic. And these allegations are,honestly,somewhat warranted. However,Michael Radford handles this precarious predicament rather deftly. If anything,I would suggest that he somehow brilliantly turns the tables on the Christians in this film.

 While Shylock is expected to show mercy,one can sympathize with him when he doesn't. In the climactic trial scene,we witness the Christians looking down their noses at him. This man that has been ridiculed and spat upon is judged to be vile and unmerciful while the Venetian Christians couldn't possibly understand what he has been through. And their view of mercy is to take all of his money away and force him to accept Jesus as savior under penalty of death. And,alas the Christians celebrate a happy ending while Shylock is left homeless.

 This junxtaposition of the Shylock/Antonio story with the fairy tale courtship is genuinely fun to watch. And Michael Radford's clever screenplay left me with a glimmer of hope in this ever- increasing fundamentalist Christian landscape.",1108080000,4,1107,5.456140350877193
