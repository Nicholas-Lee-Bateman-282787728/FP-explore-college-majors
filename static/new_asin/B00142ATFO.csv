When i got older i realized that WWF did not have the monopoly back in the 80's and before that. So i saw where some stars started before going to the WWF. So now the matches on this VHS. i'm not gonna spoiled the fun by giving you the winners, just a short list of the matches on this VHS, there are 3 matches on this VHS and the host is SGT.Slaughter. I'm pretty sure all the matches date back to 1985 since the copyright is 1985. None the less it's great Old Skool action. Have fun watching this tape and i hope my review helped you. Like you guess it this tape should be seeing by OLD Skool wrestling fans or those that would like to see how it was back in the 80's before WWF became a monopoly.
