8307084,5,B001GTRLTC,"I'm a retired NBC news and documentary producer, so I've seen more attempts at documentaries than most.  This one rates very highly with me because it has all the attributes that many documentaries lack these days.  It of course helps that the DVD is about one of my favorite subjects: hummingbirds.

It's fun, unbelievably informative, beautifully filmed, perfectly scored (the chapter that includes Tchaikovsky's ""Waltz of the Flowers"" from the ""Nutcracker Suite"" is a great example), and narrated as though one of the great voices of NBC were sitting at the microphone.  The scene in which a hummingbird escapes a praying mantis is worth the price of the DVD alone.

In other words, it is the perfect follow-on to the legacy ""Hooked on Hummingbirds"" DVD this company released a few years ago.  The fact that it uses 65 hummingbird species to show many of the birds' rarely seen behaviors in slow motion simply is (gorgeous) icing on the cake.",1288483200,,945,4.911949685534591
8307085,1,B001GTRLTC,Noticed article in local newspaper about a hummingbird video. It sounded like a great gift. Bought two for Christmas gifts don't waste your money not a well made tape.,1259971200,,167,4.793103448275862
8307086,5,B001GTRLTC,"I was doing research for a National Geographic story I wrote on hummingbirds (""Flights of Fancy,"" January 2007, pp. 114-129) when I was referred to an earlier Kaminski DVD entitled Hooked on Hummingbirds.  Its breadth and tone pleasantly surprised me, and it proved extremely useful in the preparation of my article. So when I learned of Hummingbirds! Beauty and the Beast, I purchased it out of curiosity as much as my interest in hummingbirds.  I wondered how he could improve on the first DVD and whether there was, indeed, much more he could show us.

He did, and there is.  He shows 57 hummingbird species, including the 16 that breed here.  Pretty though ours are, many of the Central and South American species are impossibly beautiful.  Some have long, exotic tails with names to match - the Violet-tailed Sylph and Booted Racket-tail, for instance.  Others have ears that they erect to intimidate competitors.  One has a loud voice that sounds more like a raptor than a hummingbird.  Another, a U.S. species named the Ruby-throated Hummingbird, is shown preparing for mission impossible: non-stop migration across the Gulf of Mexico between the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Yucatan Peninsula.  Amazing.  The nesting scenes are in a class of their own.

This video isn't just about beauty and variety - although he also shows 15 other bird species, many of them exotics such as those found in Fiji and the Galapagos Islands.  It's also about hummingbird behavior and ecology.  You see those facets of their lives in slow motion and through other special effects.  These let you grasp what they're doing as they zip along at speeds that leave your vision blurred and your head spinning.  His music choices are great, too.  Any visual associations you have with Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker"" or Mozart's ""Eine Kline Nachtmusik"" may forever be changed.  The whole thing is very informative and entertaining.

It is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in nature.  There is so much content that you'll have to watch it a few times to get everything.  I give it my highest recommendation.  --Michael Klesius",1257724800,,2113,4.977142857142857
8307087,5,B001GTRLTC,"This beautifully-filmed DVD is the second Avian Video Center hummingbird program we've purchased, and we are so happy to have witnessed, via excellent camera work, these small, but powerful creatures.  In addition to showing every U.S. species, it depicts dozens of incredibly colorful hummers that are found in Mexico, Central and South America. It also shows hummers for what they really are: wild animals that live by the law of the jungle, with special adaptations that allow them to do what they do.  We enjoyed the comparison of hummers' hovering flight to that of raptors, for example, but one of our favorite revelations was that the birds shut kown their kidneys at night.  Wish we could do that!  We liked the information ""time out"" when we were shown hummers flitting from flower to flower (none of those flowers are red!) to the tune of Tchaikovsky's ""Waltz of the Flowers.""  There is so much information that you have to watch it several times to take in everything.  A very creative, informative and entertaining DVD that we, and our young grandchildren, give our highest recommendation.  I'm buying another to give as a gift!",1233360000,4,1140,4.93717277486911
8307088,5,B001GTRLTC,"This DVD does a masterful job of revealing little-known elements of hummingbird behavior and ecology through some amazing film and very well-written narration.  As a master hummingbird bander for the Hummingbird Monitoring Network, I also am struck by the amount of research that went into the making of this video.  Among the intriguing information tidbits is the discussion of hummingbird flower mites, which ride in the bird's nostrils and compete with it for nectar.  In addition to seeing them running along its bill, we see them through a microscope as they pursue nectar, pollen, and each-other.  Some of the Latin American species of hummingbird are among the most beautiful birds I've ever seen.  With a total of 57 hummer species and loads of fascinating facts, this will have to be watched several times to get everything it has to offer.  This monumental effort warrants a five-star rating.",1228089600,5,902,5.1020408163265305
8307089,5,B001GTRLTC,"This incredibly impressive DVD captures many fascinating and often unknown hummingbird behaviors, as well as the remarkable beauty of species found in both the US and south of the border.  My family and I have never seen a hummer program this good on a commercial DVD release.  Videographer Kaminski is at his best delivering incredibly colorful clips of hummers ""doing their thing,"" often in slow motion so we can see what they're really doing.  His humorous narrative provides loads of educational information and rare insights into the typical lives of 57 species.  The musical score is outstanding.  This is a very entertaining DVD that should be in every hummer enthusiast's collection.",1226534400,8,691,5.1891891891891895
