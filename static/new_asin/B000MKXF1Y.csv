8169670,4,B000MKXF1Y,"The bizarre D.V.D. box cover catches the eye, but the low-key albeit compelling tone of the documentary GITMO: THE NEW RULES OF WAR feels like you are watching democracy's funeral. It is a peculiar funeral, though, with smiling faces of the American government and the armed forces merrily mouthing party lines on what they purport to be humane treatment of prisoners in America's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, military base, known as ""Gitmo."" However, yards from the Gitmo jail and the screams coming from within its walls, a serviceman tells the filmmakers the inmates are talking and praying.

GITMO centers on Guantanamo Bay prisoner Mehdi, a young man from Sweden, whose father stages demonstrations in their home country. Mehdi's silence seems a result of the torture in United States custody. His father cries, pondering the unspeakable things happening to his son.

While the officials deny they torture anyone, they admit to violating Geneva Convention rules, claiming they do not apply to the men they arrest. All that's missing is the scene in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN where Marty Feldman asks Gene Wilder, ""What hump?"" Perhaps the D.V.D. cover's crazy-eyed depictions of Bush and Rumsfeld are not out of place.

8169671,5,B000MKXF1Y,"This reviewer is probably not who he claims to be as a ""lefty liberal"", which by the way Democrats do not use as a term to describe themselves, only Neoconservative Republicans use this term to describe Democrats. He claims that ""worst thing they ever actually established was done inside Gitmo was 30 below air-conditioning"", which is untrue & in fact was not established nor did the filmmakers try to or stand behind. What was established were the many government documents that were released as well as leaked showing the 72 new types of torture, most of which broke the Geneva conventions. What also was established was that the new General of Gitmo, who took over after the old one did not want to break the Geneva conventions, most likely wrote these new 72 ways to torture, since the documents show they were dated two days after he took over Gitmo. Also, ex-general Karpinsky from Abu-Ghraib (which he can not even spell) spoke very bluntly about these things & much more, which this reviewer has also ignored. There was a lot of proof that this documentary that this reviewer calls ""snide"" has ignored, hmmmm, I wonder why? There are many things that are wrong & untrue in his review, too many to get into here. This reviewer is not a liberal nor a Democrat & certainly isn't telling the truth. Watch the documentary for yourself & then see how accurate his review is. For some reason this reviewer missed all of the facts & it seems most of the points. Gee I have to wonder why his review could be so inaccurate? Hmmmmm.",1177286400,6,1530,4.6286764705882355
