8051644,4,B0007TV68Y,"Part travelogue, part history of the region, this is an interesting watch for those who have read and know the Rennes Le Chateau mysteries. Henry Lincoln makes for an engaging host as he leads you around the area and discusses the various sites tied to the mysterious region. For those looking for an in depth exploration of the mystery, this might be a bit of a disappointment as it's really about exploring the region. I discovered some things I hadn't known before and it certainly whetted my appetite to explore the region next spring. I did subtract one star for the whole map theory-- which while interesting enough-- does bog things down.",1478908800,,645,4.767857142857143

8051646,4,B0007TV68Y,"Pleasant, straight forward, and clear best describes this video for me.  Sit back and enjoy this DVD as Mr. Lincoln shows off the site for you.",1403740800,,143,4.5
8051647,5,B0007TV68Y,"I had first watched this film on a Internet Streaming Player and the channel I was viewing this film on only showed a title of ""touring Rennes le Chateau. To my surprise, there was far more than I expected and was completely intrigued by the message and delivery from the narrator and his many adventures. A fascinating watch!",1394409600,,326,4.637931034482759
8051648,1,B0007TV68Y,...and it didn't dawn on me until today that this film is a Monty Python spoof of a Werner Herzog documentary.,1363305600,,110,4.285714285714286
8051649,2,B0007TV68Y,"Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books.

However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.",1150243200,5,1185,5.0152284263959395
8051650,5,B0007TV68Y,"If you're at all interested in the Rennes Le Chateau story this is a great travel log. It takes you to through a guided tour of many of the sites in the book. It also visits the sites of Lincoln's other books. If you can't make it to Southern France this is the next best thing. I enjoyed the DVD, but this will only be interesting to someone into this kind of mystery-history. If you've read Holy Blood Holy Grail and haven't been to these sites you'll enjoy this.",1125532800,19,465,4.235955056179775
