A GREAT player, David Gogo, who tours with John Mayer and the like, is probably the best bluesman you've never heard of---yet. As a Guitar player and instructor, I'm always looking for great material.

THIS DVD fills the niche PERFECTLY to bridge the player who has learned the technical skills of right-left hand coordination and simple string bending, and who knows a bit of  pentatonics, into TRUE blues and rock lead playing. He starts with a practical assessment of his own rig, with SPECIFIC ""settings"" and tone ideas, then starts  into the playing, giving Albert King, BB King, and Lonnie Mack influenced licks all over the neck, but---better yet---how they connect and build on each  other, giving you the ""true eyes"" of a player on the fretboard, and not just some Berklee Classroom theorist.

This is a practical disc, and should inspire just about any player, but especially early lead players (both rock and blues). THIS book, along with Tagliarano's Chord-Tone Soloing, and Robert Calva's Texas Blues Guitar, is all you need to REALLY learn how to start playing lead.

Thanks, David...VERY accessible and wonderful DVD. Would love to see more from this bluesman in the instructional arena...",1341100800,,1210,5.050251256281407
