2073503,1,0842368175,It was a little over the top for kids. We did not even finish it. I would not recommend at all...,1365811200,5,97,3.6666666666666665
2073504,1,0842368175,Very very poor quality. The writing and animation were horrendous. I would recommend that you seek out another Easter video for your children.,1365465600,,142,5.217391304347826
2073505,3,0842368175,"The story follows Biblical accounts fairly closely, but the animation is odd-the people look and move strangely.  My 7 year old son enjoyed it though.",1365033600,,150,5.0
2073506,1,0842368175,"This is the most irreverent, disrespectful film on a holy topic that I have ever seen or can imagine.  Throughout the film Jesus Christ is called ""the bread man"" and never referred to by his name.  I have taught Sunday School for over 35 years and even I could not follow what was going on in the film.  Unless you want your child to go around calling Jesus Christ ""the bread man"" I suggest you skip this movie.  What a waste of money!",1356134400,23,435,4.204819277108434
2073507,1,0842368175,Could only stand 3 minutes.  The animation is horrible. Would not let my children watch.,1428278400,,88,4.866666666666666
2073508,5,0842368175,Amazingly good for children! ,1428192000,,29,6.25
2073509,1,0842368175,"We were looking for an Easter video to show the kids before bed (it is the night before Easter), and found this.  It is just awful.  It felt like watching someone play Zelda on a Nintendo 64.  The dialogue is totally out of character, and the whole film is very difficult to watch.  Don't waste your time.",1428105600,,305,4.298245614035087
2073510,1,0842368175,"not that good i expected better, the animation was really bad",1428019200,,61,4.636363636363637
2073511,3,0842368175,Good for kids to view during this season,1427932800,,40,4.125
2073512,4,0842368175,Good for kids,1427328000,,13,3.6666666666666665
2073513,5,0842368175,"This is a fictionalized story of Easter.  The story is portrayed through the eyes of a young boy.  It is based in truth and keeps children engrossed in the story of the crucifixion and resurrection.  Our children's group is age 3 through grade 6 and they all watched with great interest.  The younger children did understand, but, of course, not to the degree that the older children did.",1371859200,,388,4.661764705882353
2073514,2,0842368175,Even the kids didn't like this cartoon.  The story of Jesus' death told in a very odd way.  I would not suggest this to any of my friends.,1370476800,,138,3.892857142857143
2073515,1,0842368175,The animation looks like it was done by a first year high schooler and I couldn't even bear it to try and get to the story.,1369699200,3,123,3.769230769230769
2073516,2,0842368175,It was difficult to hear the words of characters. This was very boring and would not hlod children's attention. Having the thought to produce something worthwhile is not enough. Spend the money to get a good script. The Easter story is wonderful. How you managed to make it a terrible bore is quite sad really.,1366329600,,310,4.654545454545454
8025265,5,0842368175,Excellent seller. I had a great experience. I would buy from this seller again.  The vhs is awesome.,1483747200,,100,4.555555555555555
8025266,5,0842368175,Good Movie,1464220800,,10,4.5
8025267,1,0842368175,Barely got through 10 minutes.  Doesn't discuss the story in a way children can really understand and graphics are horrible.,1459209600,,124,5.2
8025268,1,0842368175,Too heady for young children. It appears that the 'artistic' portrayal is more important than the story of Jesus. I do not recommend.,1430956800,,133,4.826086956521739
8025269,1,0842368175,"If half a star was optional, or point of a star was optional that's what this would get. The graphics were dated, but the story and the narrative were just lacking on so many levels. This did not tell a coherent story and my 7 year old spent more time asking What's going on?"", and frankly he had every right to.

ALSO -- Shame on Amazon Prime Video for this being the ONLY Easter related movie available in Amazon Prime. Pathetic!!",1428969600,2,432,4.333333333333333
8025270,1,0842368175,This was horrible. Too kiddish and dud2a poor job explaining who Jesus was and the crucifixion.  Your kid  will watch this and come away knowing  very little.,1428710400,,158,4.777777777777778
8025271,1,0842368175,Worst adaptation of the Easter story I've ever seen. Obscure characters who barely mentioned Jesus only to call him the bread man. It seemed like it was more about a boy in the ghetto than it was about the saving work of Jesus.,1428710400,4,227,4.3023255813953485
8025272,1,0842368175,"I'm sure the intentions were good, but the animation is some of the worst digital animation I've seen.  The story wasn't engaging either.  I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes of it.",1428710400,,189,4.696969696969697
8025273,1,0842368175,"Poorly written, poorly animated, poorly acted.",1428537600,,46,6.833333333333333
8025274,4,0842368175,Very inspirational!  My kids love is cartoon.,1428451200,,45,5.428571428571429
