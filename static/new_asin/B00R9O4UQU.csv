Devil Survivor 2 was a fantastic game, which I highly recommend. That said, I hate this anime with every fiber of my being. Not one thing that I loved about the game is present here, and everything is changed unnecessarily.
The best part of the game was the cast of characters, all of whom were quite interesting and likable. The anime kills all of them off, often in the same episode that introduces them. While they could die in the game, it was something you could easily avoid. Fumi's death in particular is a travesty because it leads to all of her best moments--which are some of the funniest scenes in the game, such as when she cows the demon Trumpeter into submission by throwing several laptops at him--being cut.
Polaris, the main villain of the game, is demoted to the role of a minor character who exists mainly as a plot device. Meanwhile, Yamato, who was a complex anti-hero in the game, is made to replace him as the antagonist, and as a result loses all of the depth to his character.
The protagonist himself (who the player would name in the game, and is here called Hibiki) suffered terribly in the adaptation, as well. In the game, the protagonist is wonderfully snarky and entertaining, with almost every dialogue option having at least one choice that was some kind of joke, sass, or sarcasm. In the anime, Hibiki is just a whiny moron with nothing interesting about him.
But everything I hate about this anime is at its most concentrated during the ending:
~WARNING: ENDING SPOILERS AHEAD~
Yamato is the villain in the anime, like I said. Alcor tries to kill him by grabbing him and blowing himself up, which results in his death, but somehow Yamato is completely unharmed. Then Hibiki takes his turn to confront him, and for no reason that is ever explained, Yamato suddenly starts having siezures every few minutes. Demon fusion--which was a central gameplay mechanic in the game--is pulled completely out of nowhere so that Yamato can create and summon Satan. Then, Hibiki receives demons from all of his dead friends (something which CAN NOT HAPPEN IN THE GAME: characters can send you demons, but not if they're dead, obviously) and uses them to create and summon Lucifer (and it's the wrong Lucifer: there are two different appearances that Lucifer can have in Shin Megami Tensei, depending on the specific game, and Devil Survivor 2 the anime features the one that ISN'T in Devil Survivor 2 the game). Oh, and by the way, the specific demons used to fuse these are not the same here as they are in the game, yet another thing the anime screwed up on. Anyway, Hibiki summons Lucifer, and while he and Yamato yell each other's names, Hibiki's Lucifer, rather than attacking Yamato's Satan, HUGS it, and they both explode for some reason. And this somehow kills Yamato. And then, after all that, despite the fact that EVERYONE DIED and the whole plot was ruined, the Triumphant ending somehow happens. ...If you haven't played the game, allow me to explain: the game has multiple endings, and the Triumphant ending is the closest thing that the game has to a canon ending. Basically, you can get the Triumphant ending if you play Daichi's route, but also keep everyone alive (except for the Anguished One, who dies in every route except his own) and max out their FATE scores. If the game played out even remotely close to the way that the anime does, the Triumphant ending would be IMPOSSIBLE to achieve. And yet, they went there.
~END OF SPOILERS~
I can't even begin to imagine why this adaptation came out so terribly. It feels like the director noticed that the game's plot had a few similarities to Neon Genesis Evangelion, and decided to focus on that and make it into a terrible Evangelion ripoff, rather than letting it stand as its own thing. Devil Survivor 2 is definitely one of the worst anime based on a video game that I have ever seen. Play the game instead, and stay far, far away from this anime.",1435536000,2,3979,4.6776034236804565

8694705,4,B00R9O4UQU,"Video game adaptations are hard to do I believe. In many ways jrpgs, usually the ones to get adapted or visual novels, are hours upon hours of gameplay and story. An anime at it's most can only be 10 hours to 5 (13 to 24ish episodes).  So it's becomes a taxing move to simplify so much game content into an anime, leading me to why devil survivor 2 works almost perfectly. Ds2 is a cliched plot a group of soon to be college kids get thrown into saving modern day Japan. However that is the only real cliche here. These kids aren't heroes with powers or super unique, they are normal. When they join a website that gives them the power to summon demons they become demon summoners, think Pokemon but Mature rated. The game for this is roughly 30-40 hours of gameplay and ds2 the animation does well with reducing that time into 13 episodes, roughly 5 hours. The pacing doesn't follow the game perfectly leaving a unique take on the plot, albeit with similar settings and plot moments. The animation is done very well, demons look cool and the battles/animations are very impressive. My only gripe is the dubbing. The main hero doesn't have the voice I feel suited to a main hero. Maybe this was done to keep the story like I said plausible but it just is grating to here the dude in English for a long time. The same can be said of a few other characters but again it's only a small issue. Overall this is a great anime adaptation of a game I personally recommend fans of the shin megami series to try out. Enjoy wonderful battles, an okay soundtrack and great animation.",1432252800,2,1571,4.417241379310345
