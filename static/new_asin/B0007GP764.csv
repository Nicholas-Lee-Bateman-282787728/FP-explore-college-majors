8047382,5,B0007GP764,"My son loves Todd's world and this a good long one. 105 mins worth of Todd's world for a few bucks, totally worth it. It was brand new, sealed case and works perfectly.",1488153600,,168,4.121212121212121
8047383,5,B0007GP764,Tod's world fascinated my Autism Spectrum son well up to age 9. Really helped him w/feelings and even offered great social skills and problem solving ideas. My nuero typical 3 year old now loves them too!,1480291200,,204,4.694444444444445
8047384,4,B0007GP764,My son loves these videos. The simple drawings and unique characters make this a different type of cartoon series. It stands out in contrast to the rest of them. He wants more for his birthday.,1453507200,,193,4.542857142857143

8047387,2,B0007GP764,"I really liked the price, but my 3yr old didn't like the show. He didn't like that everything was a bright color. He was getting headaches from watching it. We are not keeping it...going to give it to his cousin. I don't want something that is giving my son headaches. I have sat and watched it with him, even adjusted the color on the tv (to dull them a bit), and it is really harsh on the eyes. If there were at least SOME neutral colors, or even pastel people, it would be better. It is just really in your face with the colors. And they are pretty much ALL THE SAME COLORS. Disappointing.",1416700800,,592,4.201754385964913
8047388,5,B0007GP764,"I purchased this dvd for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She watches it over and over and never seems to get tired of watching it. She laughs throughout the entire movie. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, THIS DVD KEEPS HER QUIET. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.",1296345600,,270,4.211538461538462
8047389,5,B0007GP764,"Toddworld was a weekday morning program on TLC and Discovery Kids cable television channels. Todd and his friends are boldly drawn and colored characters and I doubt you can find an animated program that equals the bold, vivid colors. Pre-schoolers will be mesmerized by the colors.

Todd's friends are Stella, a young girl with bouffant hair style, Pickle, Sophie a very young girl with huge red pigtails, Benny the dog, and Mitzi the polka-dot cat. Todd and his friends are big, bold, original characters who will appeal to pre-schoolers.

The message throughout the episodes is simple: what makes us different makes us special. The scripts and songs are simple and entertaining. In fact this is entertainment with a capital ""E"". Hooray for Toddworld. Running time with bonus material is 105 minutes and the bonus material includes sing-alongs.

By the way, Todd is on the DVD cover and the colors are indicative of his friends and all the animation.",1261526400,2,952,5.012658227848101
8047390,5,B0007GP764,"Simple drawings, rhythmic songs, meaningful yet simple messages, unforgettable characters make for a perfect recipe for a great cartoon show for young children.

I was amazed that there existed a show that taught good morals and acceptance in an era where most shows are all about fighting heroes and impossible adventures. ToddWorld is refreshingly different: colorful and back-to-the-basics kind of cartoon.

I buy the ToddWorld DVDs for my friends' children. So far, they have all loved it and they like to bob their heads up and down as they listen to the opening songs. It's really funny to watch them. :P",1134691200,11,610,5.02970297029703
