8599758,1,B000MTEABY,I rented this video to prepare for an upcoming trip to Mexico City. It is an amateur slide show with music. Not very colorful or interesting.,1359331200,,141,4.461538461538462
8599759,1,B000MTEABY,"I bought ""Mexico City: An Ancient Mystery of Passion"", another travel guide DVD by Acacian Tales. If you want to watch a slideshow of fuzzy pictures with crummy music playing (nothing is ever said), this is your DVD. If you don't want to be ripped off, stay away.",1174953600,3,263,4.5
8599760,5,B000MTEABY,"I really like all the background information about the sightseeing in Mexico City. It covers the greatest places to visit and was really helpful in planning my journey to Mexico. This DVD takes you to Teotihuacan Pyramids (the old Aztec Pyramids), Zocalo, Templo Mayor, The National Palace, Cathedral Metropolitana, Basilica of our lady of Guadalupe and The National Museum of Anthropology and History.

It covers everything Mexico City has to offer, Great Guide.",1171152000,,463,5.342465753424658
