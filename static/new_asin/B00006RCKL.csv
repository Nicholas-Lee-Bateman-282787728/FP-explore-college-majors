1788329,5,B00006RCKL,"Before I go off reviewing probably one of the most unfairly hated anime titles in existence, I'd like to share some personal history I've had with this anime.

It was Friday afternoon back in September of 2002, and my fascination with anime was still potent since I've only been a fan for two months. I wanted to rent more anime tapes, so me and my brother went to Popeye's Chicken after school for some good eatin', and we went to the now absent Hollywood Video in our region. I went through the anime aisle and these four tapes each entitled Doomed Megalopolis caught my eye (each tape contained a different installment in the OVA). I though the titles sounded awesome and the cover art was pleasing for my adolescent male brain (one of the tapes, I believe, had Yukari depicted with slugs crawling up one of her legs). I picked up one of the tapes and read the back description, and with the noticeable ""Not for Kids"" sticker on the front, my brain screamed with joy and I came home that evening with all four volumes of Doomed Megalopolis and waited for everyone to go to bed. Once everyone was asleep, I watched all the tapes in a row and despite the total three hour running-length, I wasn't bored once and I went to bed that night pretty freaked out by what I saw, and since then, Doomed Megalopolis has been a favorite of mine for nearly eight years.

STORY

The story for Doomed Megalopolis is that in early 20th century Japan, an evil spirit named Yasunori Kato (who dons a military outfit that makes him look kinda like M. Bison from the Street Fighter games) attempts to awake Masakado (the guardian spirit of Tokyo), which would cause death and annihilation at a grand scale. However, his initial efforts prove unsuccessful, but as some years pass, he sees an innocent young lady named Yukari Tatsumiya and decides she's a perfect tool for awakening Masakado. Shortly after kidnapping Yukari, he possibly impregnates her with a child and as the years go by, Kato plans to use Yukiko (Yukari's daughter) as an even stronger tool to awake Masakado.

SCARE TACTICS

Doomed Megalopolis, being a horror anime, has some of the creepiest and unnerving imagery and atmosphere in the horror anime niche, accounting for most of this anime's high score. One of the ""horror"" things that DM does well is fuse fantasy and reality. While not done quite as well as anything involving Satoshi Kon, it's done well enough for the desired effects, and are the effects intense!! Rintaro, being the wise fellow that he is, decided to avoid repetition by mixing it up with the ""fantasy meets reality"" visions by making some of them fake and some of them really effecting the character. For example, there's a scene in Part 1: The Haunting of Tokyo, where Kato possesses Yukari to have her see the annihilation of Tokyo and after collapsing, he tries to take her soul. Not too long after, there's a scene where Junichi Narutaki (Yukari's friend) sees living black ooze crawl out of a prayer stand and consume him, but it was just a terrifying vision, so you can't really tell what will be real or fake. Though the best ""realistic nightmare"" vision has to be when in Part 2: The Fall of Tokyo, where Yukiko is possessed by Kato and is engulfed by a giant, black oozing mouth with razor-sharp teeth. There's moments where Kato's possessions are fairly simplistic yet so brazen in their evilness. An example would be when Yukari sees a circle of kids playing and singing. They start off singing ""Close your eyes and don't be scared, the evil will never find you"" (not quoted verbatim), but Yukari gets encircled by those kids and the song turns to ""Close your eyes and be scared, the evil has found you."" Doomed Megalopolis also uses violent and sexual imagery very well to enhance the terrifying atmosphere it sets out to make. Fine examples of this would be a scene in the first part of DM where Koda Rohan finds Yukari's inanimate body by a river, and when she gains consciousness, a phallic demon slug crawls out of her mouth. The other is when in Part 3: The Gods of Tokyo, Yukiko is naked and consumed by the Underground Dragon's heart (though some may be really turned off by the fact that she's only 13). Then there's scenes that are just plain messed up for no particular reason, especially when in Part 2, when Yukari is cutting off fish heads in her kitchen, she says to Narutaki ""I don't know why, but I've been feeling much better today."" with a really creepy face while stabbing at the fish violently. There's plenty more, but I don't want to give you every little detail about the fantastic horror tactics in this anime.

CHARACTERS

Depending on who you are, your glass is either half-full or half-empty in this area. To me, my glass is half-full because the characters range from being interesting to so-so. Examples of the interesting characters are Kato and Yukari's older brother, Yoichiro Tatsumiya. Kato is interesting because not only is he one of the most intensely evil characters in anime (I had to reference him in my review for Morbid Angel's ""Altars of Madness"" because of how evil he is), he also has some intriguing reasons for his detestable actions (which is covered towards the beginning of Part 2, so pay attention when watching it). Tatsumiya is also interesting because of his slimy nature and his really mixed feelings about his sister, Yukari. In the past, he had a murky encounter with Yukari and has been haunted by this for a long time. After finding out about her supposed affair with Kato, he commits incest against Yukari in her sleep. I guarantee that you'll want to shank Tatsumiya repeatedly with a sharp, rusty improvised weapon after seeing that. Yukari and her daughter, Yukiko, sorta fall in the middle ground between interesting and dull because while they're certainly the lifeblood of this anime, you don't really get to see them in depth, other than to see their super passive personalities; even though the creators of DM were really pressed on time and money, it would have been nice if the relationship between Yukari and her daughter was fleshed out more. Though in defense of the way the two are fleshed out, it was probably because Japanese culture (especially prior to their defeat in World War 2) tends to bend their women into being passive and invisible when put up against the males. However, Keiko Tatsumiya (who'd be a crucial character in Parts 3 and 4: The Battle for Tokyo) is an interesting female character since when compared to Yukari and Yukiko, stands out due to her backbone and immense supernatural powers, but also has the will to confront her husband, Yoichiro, about his contempt for Yukari and Yukiko. However, some characters, like Narutaki and Koda just seem there to propel the story along. Which is a shame because they had some potential. All in all, the characters are decent, and certainly light-years superior to the walking cliches in Elfen Lied.

APPEARANCE

The animation, while overall decent, can be inconsistent at times. There's some scenes that are beautifully animated with great artwork, some other scenes look visually inferior and unfitting stylistically. However, these stylistic inconsistencies don't happen much, so they really don't effect the grade that much. The character designs have their good and bad sides. While the appearance of the characters themselves look quite pleasing (especially Yukari in Part 1, since I think she's one of the prettiest ladies in anime), they could have had some more stylistic diversity. The biggest problem is that once Part 3 begins, it can be difficult to distinguish Keiko from Yukari (especially at the very start of Part 3), but after a while, you can distinguish the two from each other. The background art is very painterly and finely detailed. Contrary to Charles Solomon's disdain for the color-scheme, I love the colors used for DM since they really make you feel unnerved and combined with the amazing soundtrack, also gives an ethereal feeling on some occasions. Also contrary to Solomon's critiques, I felt the characters were drawn pretty well; I don't recall much, if any ""awkward"" poses. The shape-shifters created by the occult parchments look like abominationss Don Hertzeld would see if he listened to a lot of early wave death metal (such as Morbid Angel and Nocturnus) while inebriated on large amounts of vodka and marijuana. In other words, they look quite creepy and bizarre. Because this was a low budget animation created in collaboration between Toei and Madhouse from 1991-1992, the grainy picture quality and minor imperfections (nothing terrible) in the artwork enhance the unnerving atmosphere this anime already generates, making it even better.

SOUNDTRACK

Doomed Megalopolis has one of the absolute best soundtracks I've ever heard in any anime. Infact, the soundtrack is so amazing, it's one of the extremely rare anime soundtracks I own in CD format. Kazz Toyama really pulled a doozie on us with this soundtrack since the only other anime soundtrack I know he did was for Cyber City Oedo, which was late 80's instrumental synth-pop cheese galore (though a guilty pleasure, nonetheless). However, for Doomed Megalopolis, Toyama uses keyboards, synthesizers, intense drums, and shredding guitars to create a truly chilling and heart-pounding sonic experience that really bolsters the fine qualities DM already has going for it. The keys and synths are used to employ organ-like sounds fused with more traditional horror-entry atmosphere with Steve Vai (not really him that did it) occasionally popping in to mangle his guitar to make it sound like hell in shred guitar format. However, it's not all doom and hellish excitement; there's some piano-driven pieces used for more peaceful and ambient effects in the few ""brighter"" areas of this anime. Toyama struck gold with this soundtrack and sadly, he doesn't get credit for doing so. All in all, the soundtrack alone is one of the best of its kind and if you can find it, I recommend getting it just so you can get an exhilarating audio experience.

THEMES

Doomed Megalopolis takes a smart path by incorporating themes in a subtle manner to actually make the audience think and not look at all pretentious. The two most prominent themes in DM are its use of history to build upon the story and the use of Eastern religion. An example of the former is the use of the Great Kanto Earthquake in the story and an example of the latter is embodied with Keiko's character since she's believed to be the Goddess of Mercy, or in more proper terms, a Kannon. There's also achieving the status of Bodhisattva (enlightened being) and the Buddhist principles of love and hate. I recommend you conduct some research on these topics so you can understand DM's ending better. There's even the use of traditional Japanese spiritual beliefs concerning paying respect to the dead since this is a big factor with the evils at work. While less implied, I believe there's a theme of the struggle between Japanese traditionalism and Westernization embodied in Yoichiro, since he often wears Western clothing yet maintains his devotion to rather misogynistic principles that were commonplace in Japan in that time.

MATURE CONTENT

This is an anime that you should never let your kids see because of how disturbing it is visually and mentally. There's quite a good helping of gore along with the previously mentioned nudity and sexual content. However, as stated before, I think for the most part, they're used very well to further the disturbing concepts at work and not just for the sake of having them.

UNFAIR CRITICISM

While I rarely engage in the following behavior, I feel it's necessary to vehemently counteract the negative publicity surrounding this anime because most of the critiques it receives are really unfair and inconsistent. So right now, I'll protect Doomed Megalopolis much like Ellen Ripley defending Newt in Aliens from an incoming horde of aliens with an M41A pulse rifle/flamethrower. Many people have complained about the misogynistic content in this anime, though it's not really that much greater in magnitude when compared to other adult anime from the same time period since that was a selling point for anime titles (such as Wicked City) in the then fledgling anime market in the US. What people don't really like to acknowledge is that as stated before, Japan's culture had strong amounts of misogyny prior to full scale Westernization, and since DM took place at a time when Japan resisted Westernization, I felt the creators were only being historically accurate about these unpleasant yet true acts that were common back then. The acts of gory violence are also condemned, which doesn't really make sense since it's roughly on the same level as popular titles from the early 90's like Ninja Scroll, so that critique right there is inconsistent. What gets me irritated even more is that many of the people who decry Doomed Megalopolis for its intense violence and sexual content, praise really trendy yet detestable anime titles like Elfen Lied and Gantz, conveniently overlooking the fact that both really outdo DM in terms of violence and sexual content. For those who hated DM for its extreme content, what were you expecting this to be?  Smurfs dancing in the fields and picking flowers?  The notoriety surrounding DM somewhat reminds me of the bashing movies like The Thing (1982), Alien 3 (1992), and Event Horizon (1997) received for being ""too creepy, violent, and disgusting."" While all three films managed to rope in respectably large cult followings and even newfound respect in more mainstream circles, DM unfortunately still lingers in obscurity without a noticeable following. I hope this review can get people to think about this anime and give it a chance.

FINAL WORD

Doomed Megalopolis isn't for everyone. However, if you're looking for a horror anime that will really freak you out all while delivering a unique and intriguing story, then Doomed Megalopolis will reward you greatly.",1276905600,4,14032,4.902274641954508

1788331,5,B00006RCKL,"Since animation can rarely shock, Doomed Megalopolis wisely chooses the alternate Horror route: it disturbs.

He is temporarily successful each time; head-spinning and vomiting up strange phallic creatures are only some of the joys Yukari experiences time and again, and she is quickly reduced to a raving madwoman.",1124928000,3,511,5.2439024390243905
1788332,5,B00006RCKL,"Lots of people don't seem to really like this film, Im not sure why, it has the typical amount of violence and strangeness that one would expect from most anime films.  Who knows?
Anyways, for all of you graphic freaks out there, this movie will not sit well with you.  As it is not up to todays standards, because it was released in the early 90's.  However for those of us who aren't graphic freaks, the graphics are still good regardless.
The story of this movie, revolves around a man hellbent on destroying Tokyo.  This man is Kato Yasunari, and he isn't your every day Joe.  He wields awesome power, at one point pulling the Moon into the Earth.  To stop his crusade of destruction are an assortment of individuals, a scientist, a college student, a psychic, and most importantly a temple maiden who isn't all she appears to be.  The charcters are all interesting in their own ways, and stay a large part of the story throughout the movie.
There are really two parts to the story, Kato, and the family he is using in his evil schemes.  This family is really screwed up thanks to the older brother, who is a man obsessed with work and social status.  You will not like the borther, as he is a very bad person.  The sister is insane thanks to her brother and the demon Kato, who each in some way traumatize her.  Later in the movie a focus is also placed on the daughter of the sister, who possess some magical power, and who is a tool of Kato.
This is a great story as far as anime standards go, and the ending involving Kato and the temple maiden is excellent.
Warning:  This movie is definitely not for children.",1087344000,4,1619,4.377926421404682

1788334,4,B00006RCKL,"What is a WTF Movie you ask?  A WTF movie is a What the (Fill in the blank) movie.  Doomed MEgallopolis is a Mid 90's sci fi anime involving Sorcerors, Dragons, and gods.  The story revolves around a sorceror named Kako who wishes to destroy tokyo.  This two DVD set expands upon this story starting with Kako going after a young women in order to use her to resurect a god, after realizing that she is two weak he impreginates her and 11 years later he uses the daughter to destroy tokyo.  However Tokyo is not so easily vanquished as a few years later Tokyo is rebuilt and he realizes that the spirit is to weak.  So he goes for the dragon sleeping underneath to destroy tokyo for good.  At this point the Goddess of Mercy shows up to stop him ending in a fairly bloody battle.
The reason this a WTF movie is the small things that catch your attention, and or disgust you.  For example in episode one the woman about halfway through ends up vomiting out a demon that has a penis for a tounge.  That is only in the first episode.  There are other moments to include the bizzare ending which does not needed interpreted but is strange none the less.",1041206400,7,1149,4.3023255813953485
1788335,4,B00006RCKL,"This is a four part series, originally created in 1992, that tells the story of an evil necromancer dead set on the destruction of Tokyo and the small group of people who desperately try to stop him.  Kato Yasinori is the magician whose plan is to raise the spirit of Taira No Masikado a 10th Century samurai rebel.  If woken, Masikado's anger will trigger the end of Tokyo.
Caught up in the opening stanzas of Kato's plot are Yukari Tatsumi and her brother, Yukari's daughter Yukiko and Naritake a close friend.  The mage intends to use Yukari as a vessel for the re-incarnated samurai.  When this fails he turns to Yukiko, but she is unsuitable because she is the result of Yukari's rape by her brother.  Although unsuccessful at awakening the spirit, Kato manages to disturb the dragon of the earth sufficiently to trigger the devastating earthquakes of 1923, where over 74,000 died and millions left homeless.
In the last two episodes, Kato plans to renew his efforts at the destruction of Tokyo but taking advantage of the reconstruction effort.  Secretly he works to draw down the moon, using a slingshot effect to ruin the city, and possible, the earth.  This time, however, Tatsumi has married Keiko, a priestess of Masakado.  With the help of a psychic, Kureda, she wages the battle with the necromancer, but it appears to be a hopeless struggle in the face of overwhelming magical powers.  In its final form, it becomes a struggle between the Goddess of Mercy and the Spirit of the Dead.
Director Rin Taro based this screenplay on an original story by Hiroshi Aramato, oulling no punches in the process.  This is a violent film - not do to a lot of killing, but due to an undercurrent of sexual sadism that periodically breaks loose, leaving the viewer more than a little unnerved.  While the plot does stay within certain limits, it is decidedly and adult story, more properly a horror film than a fantasy story.  It combines just enough of real history and common legend to make the tale compelling, but occasionally prone to unexplained events.
The basic art work is good, evoking the Japanese equivalent of gothic atmosphere.  But the animation uses to many short cuts and lacks fluidity.  Even so it has an atmospheric strength that is the perfect counterpoint to the rough edges of the story line.  If your taste runs to noir horror make a point of seeking this out.",1039996800,17,2382,4.733656174334141
1788336,4,B00006RCKL,"Back in the early nineties, Streamline Entertainment seemed to be going after some of the explicit work from Japan. Most of them were very successful and lead to other series, but Doomed Megalopolis seemed to not have gotten the attention it so deserved. I mean it was directed by the famous Rintaro (Metropolis, Galaxy Express 999).
Doomed Megalopolis obviously takes place in Tokyo. The story occurs during the early 1990's when Japan was just starting to modernize. However, evil is afoot as an ancient ghost from China's army called Kato seeks revenge on Tokyo. He tries to summon the soul of Masakado to aid him, but to no prevail. Thus, Kato starts to manipulate certain people in order to get his revenge.
DM contains lots of Japanese mythology references such as the belief of the Earth is a dragon with arteries underground. Another element that is present is actual events like the 1923 earthquake in Japan. When you can successfully mix actual events with mythology, you have a great story. I've heard many people call DM a horror anime, but it doesn't seem to be setup like a horror movie. There is very little death, if any, of the main characters. There are some moments that will remind you of Nightmare on 34th Street, but the similarities end there.
Thats not to say there isn't any action. There are some strange, but quite pleasing battles of spiritual war. To put it simply, it's a good-vs-evil war. The characters all have good qualities and some seem pretty realistic. Actually, character development seems to be driving this anime. And, yes, there is some sex, but not much. There is are some tentacles in the first episode and there is a rape scene, but it's not explicit. However, with an exception for nudity during the last couple of episodes, DM is pretty clean.
I am proud ADV finally picked up this title, but they could have done a lot better. First off, they didn't include the Japanese track. I am happy that now I don't have to worry about wearing out those old DM tapes from Streamline, but the purpose of anime on DVD is to get both tracks. The dub is fine and all, but I wouldn't mind to hear the original track. Moreover, there is some kanji in DM that I really think they should have translated. Soft subtitles could have done the job, but all ADV did was just rip the original prints from Streamline and slap them on a disc.
Overall, DM is a good value considering you get all four 50-minute episodes in one convient package. Doomed Megalopolis is a great anime title that I think every anime fan should atleast try.",1038528000,10,2556,4.63215859030837
7972549,5,B00006RCKL,"I really enjoyed this anime. It had a interesting yet tragic story.
The animation style was great for its time, and I like animation with an older look to it. The villain (with the military uniform) was sinister, and had a hunger for revenge(you could see it in his face).
The story was very tragic, especially when the story revolved around the brother and the sister; the brother is later exposed of his heinous past deed that is the initial cause of his sister's suffering and additionally caused his sister to be prone to the evils of the supernatural. It is troubling because throughout the story the brother is harassed by the memory of that past deed; this terrible act the brother had committed consumed him so much, (in my opinion) that's why he spent so much time working, to forget about the past, (and at one point the sister tries to give her brother, while at work, a fresh pair of clothes because he had been gone from home for several days) which also proves he tries to be away for extended periods of time to be away from the very memory(his sister) that torments him. Just absolutely horrid.
I also recall one part where the brother goes out to a see a prostitute, and he eventually gives into his heinous lust; he begins to strangle the prostitute, but amazingly she is unfazed and begins laughing to then say in a taunting tone,
""You're one of those! Ahahahahaha, go ahead, hurt me, ahahahahah!""
The ashamed look on the brother face is priceless and says a lot.
The brother-sister relationship of the story freaked me out because that's very sad in the case of the sister; the sister eventually becomes crazed (which is also the fault of the brother) and no longer talks as well, which is even more sad because in the first episode the sister is so happy and calm but then the evil creeps in to torment and change her.
Overall, I liked this anime and although I was saddened by the story, I can still appreciate it. I was also surprised these DVDs were used, and for not bad of a price too, almost $20; the DVD box showed NO signs of being used too.",1520035200,,2070,4.464379947229552

7972556,3,B00006RCKL,"Never have I seen a show that has the been the victim of such cultural disparity as DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS. Given the usually hostile reception this anime gets from English viewers not shared by Japanese fans, it is clear that something was lost in translating this thing from Japan to the English speaking world. Indeed something WAS lost in the translation...

For starters, DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS is based on the classic occult novel TEITO MONOGATARI (TALE OF THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL), written by a bibliophile and encyclopedic ""renaissance man"" who specializes in fantasy literature, natural history, folklore and several other subjects; Mr. Hiroshi Aramata. The novel caused a sensation becoming a bestseller with over 3 million sales in Japan alone only a few years after its publication. It would then go on to garner critical praise and win the Nihon Science Fiction Taisho Grand Prize (the same national award that NEON GENESIS EVANGELION won; it is most comparable to the Nebula Award in the West) of 1987. Of course with all that success come the commercial adaptations, one of which was a ridiculously expensive film adaptation in 1988.  That adaptation went on to hold a place in the top ten highest grossing films of the Japanese box office of that respective year. After that, more adaptations came including manga, spin-off novels, sequels, video games, and this anime.

Why was the original book so popular? Basically it was a very unique melding of modern history and the supernatural which introduced many new occult tropes in modern Japanese fantasy fiction. Onmyodo (Yin Yang) mysticism, Feng Shui mythology, Kimon Tonkou magic, etc. are just a few examples of some of the esoteric or mythical Eastern concepts that this book first popularized for a modern Japanese audience. Onmyodo mysticism especially went on to become a big fad in Japanese popular culture after this novel. Just look at all the anime/manga like TOKYO BABYLON, X, SHONEN ONMYOJI, ONMYO TAISENKI, SHAMAN KING, TOKYO RAVENS, NURA: RISE OF THE YOKAI CLAN, etc. and video games like SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI that heavily feature onmyodo magic or variants of. Beyond that, the novel was also a meticulously researched alternate history featuring a great deal of real events and people from Japan's past.

The novel has become something of a classic still being republished and read today 30 years after its publication.  You're likely to find it, or one of its many spinoffs, in any local Japanese bookstore you visit.  It has inspired several artists and scholars, and has elevated the status of its author, Hiroshi Aramata, to the level of a national celebrity renowned for his encyclopedic knowledge. But of course because of the huge number of cultural references and the ""Japanese-specific"" nature of the work, the original novel has been never been considered for translation. In the West, the only things to have been translated are the anime and the first live action film.

Back when DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS was released in the mid-90's in the West, many English viewers didn't know where the story came from. Fast forward to the 21st century in the age of the hyper fast internet and many English viewers...still fail to acknowledge the source material. Despite the fact that this is the 21st century with information readily available online (literally only a Google search away), lots of English viewers continue to be ignorant of the existence of the original novel and judge the anime as a standalone product instead of an adaptation.

Now this wouldn't be such an issue if these viewers were a little more respectful of the subject matter in the story, giving the culturally relevant elements the benefit of the doubt. But many of the harsh reviews I've seen don't consider this background...rather choosing to decry the story and subject matter as nonsensical, sleazy trash completely ignorant (or inconsiderate) of the fanbase of thousands in Japan. In 2011, an internet celebrity Bennett the Sage posted a 2-part video review of the anime condemning the whole thing (especially the story) as ""insultingly stupid"".  What's shocking about his review is that it actively targets many of the folklore references as ""evidence"" of the story's ""stupidity"" (I guess Japanese folklore is ""stupid""?).

Geez...What if a popular critic were to attack one of the HARRY POTTER films, calling the story ""completely stupid"" and citing the presence of wizards and witches (European folklore) as evidence of its ""stupidity""? Don't you think the HARRY POTTER fanbase would have something to say about that?

Bennett's review may have been the latest and greatest of negative reactions against this anime, but as I will discuss below though, it has had a whole history of controversy.  If these critics did their research, then I would be surprised if they showed the same level of hostility. How could anyone be so quick to call the basic premise or story ""insultingly stupid"" knowing that it was based on a groundbreaking, Grand Prize winning 3000 page novel written by a respected ""human encyclopedia"", former professor, natural history specialist, folklore specialist, literary critic and translator?? If you were to do that in Japanese speaking sci-fi/fantasy circles, you would DEFINITELY raise a few eyebrows.  I could understand an argument about it being too convoluted, but ""stupid""?  ""Convoluted"" and ""stupid"" are not the same thing. But many harsh English critics of DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS have been getting away with these kind of ignorant attacks for years, completely inconsiderate of the cultural differences, the source material, the basis of the anime, and the fanbase on the other side of the world.

Let me straighten out one thing here: the story is not the problem. If it was the problem, the novel would have never sold that many copies or been critically acclaimed and Hiroshi Aramata would still be a poor obscure nobody in Japan.

What is a problem is how the anime handles the story.  Like so many adaptations of giant literary works (scifi or otherwise), TEITO MONOGATARI loses a lot of substance in the translation from book to screen.  Likewise it's difficult to recommend this adaptation to Western viewers because: a) the plot is a super abridged, highly stylized and incomplete version of a novel that has never been translated into English and b) it's aimed at the wrong culture.

Regarding the narrative, the anime only adapts the first 1/3rd of the novel (first 1000 pages), meaning it is incomplete. But apparently those 1000 pages still contain too much material because the narrative in the anime shoots along at lightning speed. It also features many wild and exaggerated representations of supernatural phenomena that may be entertaining for someone well versed in the story and its mythology, but distracting for those just being initiated into it.

Regarding the culture, the story is filled with way too many Japanese historical and folklore references that are not expounded upon for the benefit of the uninformed viewer. For example, many of the characters in the plot are based on real celebrities from Japan's past. Although it may be fun for a Japanese person to see their historical heroes in a story about the supernatural, their inclusion won't mean anything to Western viewers.

Let me just try to convey the plot in one paragraph:

The protagonist, Yasunori Kato, is a descendant of many famous historical mystics including the founder of Shugendo, Enno Gyoja and the onmyoji Abe no Seimei; but his bloodline goes back to the indigenous tribal folk from Japan's prehistory (sort of like the Ainu people). Kato wants revenge against the Japanese Empire for the sins the Yamato Court inflicted upon his people in the past. His desire for vengeance turns him into an oni and in the early 20th century (which is where the story starts) he tries to arouse the spirit of the ancient warlord Taira no Masakado, a real life local deity and national rebel from Japan's past, to use as a weapon destroy Tokyo, the current capital of the Japanese Empire. Opposing Kato is Yasumasa Hirai, the rightful descendant of Abe no Seimei and the greatest onmyoji in all of Japan. These two master mystics fight it out with the fate of the Imperial Capital at stake. Caught in the middle of this exotic mayhem is the Tatsumiya family, the descendants of Masakado, whose eldest member Yoichiro, is seriously disturbed. Meanwhile the Soma Family (another bloodline descended from Masakado) send out a trained shrine maiden to defend the Tatsumiya family and stop Kato's machinations.

More references come pouring in...Do you know what kodoku magic is? How about Shikigami? Tsuchimikado Shinto? Kimon Tonkou? Kohbo Daishi Kukai? Koda Rohan? Eichii Shibusawa? Kannon? The narrative of the anime does not stop to explain these elements (aside from small comments by the characters). But they tie into the story and direct the narrative, so you need to have some prior familiarity with them.

Whereas most anime take inspiration from Japanese (and Chinese) mythology and history to create their own unique fantasy universes, DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS builds its entire story purely off of those references, similar to how works like Alan Moore's LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN builds its entire story off references to classic Victorian literature.  Think about it, it's unlikely you would read LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN unless you had some interest in Victorian literature.  Likewise, it's also unlikely you would read (or in this case, watch) TEITO MONOGATARI unless you had some interest in Japanese history and folklore.  For example if you don't know the classic stories of Abe no Seimei (the ""Japanese Merlin"") when you watch the anime, you will have a hard time understanding just who the hell Kato and Hirai are and what kind of magics they're using. If you have no familiarity with the writings of Izumi Kyoka, the whole significance of his conversation with the heroine will be lost on you. If you have no idea about the life and legacy of Koda Rohan, you'll probably be confused trying to understand why the story treats him like such a major character but doesn't take the time to develop him. And of course if you absolutely no clue about who Kannon is, the ending of the show will make no sense whatsoever.

There are also some symbols that Western viewers will undoubtedly misinterpret here, such as the pentagram that pops up a lot during the show. Most Western viewers who see the pentagram assume it has a satanic connotation because Kato is evil and he uses it. In Japanese folklore however, the pentagram is derived from the Chinese principles of ""Wu Xing"" (""The Five Phases/Elements"") and was the magic symbol used by Abe no Seimei, the historical ancestor of both Kato and Hirai. This is never explained in the anime though.  These are just a couple examples of how you have to have some prior familiarity with these old cultural references before you can totally understand and appreciate the story told here.  Little to no exposition is given throughout the anime; it's completely up to the audience to catch these references.  It's clear that the writers did not feel obligated to reexplain these cultural nods to viewers whom they assumed would already be somewhat familiar with them.

Some Western critics will argue that DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS, being an adaptation, should completely stand alone and TRANSCEND cultural limitations. But one has to take into account the period in which the show was created. In the early 90's, anime was made purely for a Japanese audience. Japanese writers made no leeway made for foreign viewers, meaning that cultural specific references and such were left unexplained for the most part. Compounding the problem back then was that a lot of anime adaptations of popular material were highly compressed and abridged, made purely for the purpose of entertainment and not intended as a replacement for the source material. For example, the AKIRA film, although a complete adaptation, heavily, heavily compresses its 2000 page source material to accommodate a 2 something hour time slot. X THE MOVIE is another example, compressing 8 volumes of a popular manga into a 2 hour time slot. In both cases (as fans of the source material will tell you), the narrative suffers a lot. The writers and artists, being pressed for time and money, didn't care about creating ""epic trilogies"" to bring legions of new fans into the fold. They were too busy catering to an already established fanbase. If you wanted a more developed story, you were expected to go out and buy the source material, find magazines or other fans and educate yourself. DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS does the exact same thing, except with literature instead of manga. Oh and remember...DOOMED MEAGALOPOLIS had actually had four visual adaptations of the novel prior. That was a lot of material to consult before you even approached the anime.

So the sad, sad truth is that this anime should NEVER have been brought to the West in the first place. The only reason it did was due to marketing pressures: it was weird, exotic, and violent so the distributors wanted to sell it to the exploding anime market in the West ($$$). They could have cared less about the cultural differences or the source material. But in Japan, the anime was SPECIFICALLY made to cash in on the popularity of the franchise spawning from the novel. This is especially evident by the fact that in the interviews with the staff on the SPECIAL EDITION DVD, the first thing discussed is the NOVEL as if it's something all their viewers were already intimately familiar with (""Assuming you read the novel, you know blah blah blah""). Like I said, the novel sold over 3 million copies in Japan in its first few years of publication; the producers probably thought ""Who wouldn't know about it? Why the hell would anyone buy this if he/she wasn't familiar with the story?""

For a very loose Western literary analogy, consider LORD OF THE RINGS. Nobody would dare question the high status of Tolkien's literary saga in the world of fantasy literature. But before Peter Jackson came along, the early cinematic adaptations that were created of it don't exactly rank as classics by today's standards. The first version of THE HOBBIT (1977) was a low budget made for TV affair with cheap animation that heavily abridged the story, exaggerating and downplaying certain stuff along the way. The Ralph Bakshi animated adaptation is generally criticized for featuring a narrative difficult to follow for people not familiar with the source material as well as for being unfinished. DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS falls between these adaptations. Like TV HOBBIT, its a relatively low budget affair that compresses and stylizes the story. Like the Bakshi film, it is also is darker than its source material, as well as a blatantly incomplete adaptation.

Another analogy I can think of is Frank Herbert's DUNE.  If a viewer were to base his whole impression of Frank Herbert's magnum opus purely off of David Lynch's compressed 1984 film adaptation, he might be confused why the work is so significant.

The problem is that, unlike LORD OF THE RINGS, TEITO MONOGATARI has not had the solid, complete visual treatment that it deserves yet. Combine this with the fact that its difficult to sell the novel outside of Japan, and you realize the problem: all Westerners get exposed to are these flawed adaptations which reference characters, mythology, and history found in material not available in English.

Of course you can watch the Streamline's simplified English dubbed version (also on the SPECIAL EDITION), but this makes things even more confusing. The English dubbed version tries to dumb things down by eliminating the Japanese references and replacing them with loose Western parallels (onmyoji becomes ""priest"", etc., shikigami becomes ""spirit cards"", etc.), reducing plot points in the process. But the story makes even less sense without them since those references are the foundation of the plot. Part of the problem is the translation: terms like the Western cultural connotations of ""priest"" don't translate accurately over to what an onmyoji is. For a parallel situation, imagine if somebody translated LORD OF THE RINGS and referred to Gandalf as a ""monk"" throughout. Wouldn't that be a little awkward?

Things get even more messy when you combine these changes with unexplained elements such as the pentagram symbol. The sight of the virtuous ""priests"" using pentagrams to execute their holy magics might be mind boggling for a Western viewer with a Christian background. It will definitely seem like nonsense. Don't get me wrong though...the actual performances in the English dub are not that bad. The problem is with the dialogue. If you want to understand the story as it was intended, the Japanese version is your only option.

But once you've got the story under control, you're ready to roll and the show can be very gripping, if somewhat disturbing. The animation is excellent for a low budget OVA series from the 90's. The soundtrack is very moody mixing synthesizers, organs, guitars and piano medleys to create a gothic and tragic atmosphere. The pacing of the story is very fast (and it better be, being an adaptation of 1000 pages of text), and constantly entertaining. The voicework (in the Japanese version at least) is exceptionally good, with Kyusaku Shimada's distinct guttural voice stealing the stage as Yasunori Kato. Shimada had previously become hugely popular playing Kato in both the stage and film adaptations of the novel, so getting him back for the anime version was simply a natural idea. I think episodes one and two are the best. Episode three feels a bit more formulaic and loses some steam due to the lack of the Tsuchimikado Family (Kato's main opponents from the first two episodes). However it and #4 are still good and lead up to an appropriate conclusion.

And despite compressing so much, the writers did skim the narrative down just enough to allow the story to focus on only a couple of linear plots instead of a million subplots (like in the novel). The main two stories here are the various characters' conflict with Kato and Yoichiro's terrible relationship with his family. In the original novel, the latter subplot was relegated more to the sidelines because the Tatsumiya family was a reclusive bunch, and the narrative glossed over them in favor of the ""bigger picture"". The anime brings it right to the fore though, portraying the situation as a disturbing tragedy. The biggest change is to Yoichiro, who is shown as sick minded and mentally unbalanced. He expresses disdain and hostility for Yukari, his sister, as a mask for his incestuous attraction toward her. Yukari is the innocent victim of his abuse, but her determination to serve her brother in the family's good name leads her to madness. Kato's supernatural terror adds extra stress to an already fractured group. Eventually this latter plotline ties together with the other one in the last episode.

Unfortunately the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying and forced.  The main reason for this is that, as said before, the anime ONLY covers the first 1/3RD of the original novel and tags on a deus ex machina climax to provide closure.  But it doesn't work.  Character development is left hanging and several questions remain unanswered.

All this would have been resolved in the original novel.  Why they never finished adapting it, I don't know. Most likely it was due to time and money pressure as well as the fact that this whole production was trying to cash in on the success of the previous live action adaptation (which also only covered the first 1/3rd of the novel).  This should be evidence to anyone that the anime is not a replacement for the original novel, and should not be considered a ""great"" or 100% adaptation by any means.

CRITICISM/SEX AND VIOLENCE:

For the longest time now, DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS has had one of the most controversial reputations in the anime community.  It's not as bad as NINJA RESURRECTION, but still pretty controversial.  Some reviewers, like USA Anime will defend the show as a classic of the genre.  But there are a lot of anime fans who will balk at the mere mention of the title and will try their damndest to convince you it's a piece of trash.  Charles Solomon's dismissive jab about the anime being a ""jejune gorefest"" is one example.  There was a recent debate on the website TVTropes.org about whether DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS should be included in the universal list of ""So Bad, It's Horrible"", solidifying its status as one of the worst anime of all time.  Contention came from both sides.

Generally most of the positive reviews I've read seem seem to agree on the consensus that the anime is a solid gothic thriller.  What do the naysayers so vehemently dislike about this show?  This was more difficult to understand because, from what I've gathered, it's a little bit of everything.  Too misogynistic, too confusing, too violent, too boring, too ""lame"", etc.

One consistent criticism that I always see brought up though is the gratuitous sex and violence.  Yes, there is a fair amount of unnecessary racy ""padding"" here, such as the nightmare scenes purely intended to gross viewers out.  The story could have, and indeed has been, told without a lot of this stuff.

That said, I still think the anime fanbase is still being a tad bit...err...hypocritical.

Sure DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS has some nasty moments; so does WICKED CITY.  Why are so many Western anime fans out there so defensive of hyper violent ""mature"" productions like WICKED CITY and NINJA SCROLL in the first place? Ultra-violence, complex story-lines with mature themes, eroticism...these are the kind of things which made ""mature"" anime so popular in the first place.  Think about it...if gratuitous violence really was taboo, then shows like AKIRA, NINJA SCROLL, WICKED CITY, HELLSING, GANTZ, etc. would be dismissed and forgotten as trash a long time ago.  Clearly such is not the case.  It also really is confounding how the fanbase endorses shows like WICKED CITY, which feature some pretty graphic depictions of women being objectified and abused, but upon seeing DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS, they become turncoats, taking the moral high ground and pulling out their hair at the mere suggestion of a rape subplot.

Considering the success of the aforementioned shows, you can understand why the producers upped the nastiness quotient on DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS: marketing.  The original novel was a much lighter affair and was very expository by contrast. For example, not a lot goes on in the first book aside from character introductions, mountains of historical infodumping, social interactions, and a few descriptions of monsters. Indeed, the issue described above is one of the primary reasons the novel has never been considered for translation.  It's not very effective with a visual medium like anime. So the anime had to pump up the imagery and sensational elements. And at that time in the anime industry, lots of violent/nasty adult shows like WICKED CITY, NINJA SCROLL and that dastardly LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND were the ones making money.  The makers of the show felt that in order to attract an adult anime audience the would have to pump it up with racy content.  It was a sign of the times.

Objectionable moments I can remember off the top of my head include:
--A woman pukes up a worm with a phallus shaped head.
--Magical impregnation that's very quick
--A rape that occurs off-screen
--A man explodes in a quick gory flash
--A nightmare scene with some sensual conduct
--A girl has her period
--Instances of female nudity

But that's all I can think of. There's no full-on graphic sex scene ala NINJA SCROLL. There's no ""fanged genitalia"" ala WICKED CITY. And there's not even half as much gory violence and images of death and killing as in NINJA SCROLL or AKIRA (in fact, throughout the anime, only ONE character is murdered onscreen iirc).

Bennett really had a major problem with the incest subplot.  However incest and even rape shouldn't come off to Westerners as foreign topics in ""mature"" fantasy fiction (think about George Martin's GAME OF THRONES, Tolkien's own SILMARILLION and even some classic mythology).  And no...contrary to Bennett's wild accusations, we're NOT supposed to approve of the character of Yoichiro (the rapist brother); he's a sick minded control freak with some serious issues. Granted DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS is a mature title, but this is NOT a hentai; it's an unnerving dark fantasy story about a culture at war with itself.

So why the extra critical hostility towards DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS?  Well, I can't speak for everyone...but I think it has to do with the confusing and cryptic nature of the narrative.  Streamline tried their best to dumb down the story for English viewers to understand it, but Western anime fans were not convinced.  They ultimately realized they were watching something that simply could not make sense of.  The cultural elements of the story, which formed a major part of the appeal for its native audience, simply bored and confused the heck out of Western viewers.  However Western viewers could understand the sex and violence.  Sex and violence are a universal language.  These elements stood out in much greater proportion to the other aspects of the production because of how provocative they were by comparison.

Anyways...I'm getting off the main topic here.  The main question is:  Will you like DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS? I think that's dependent on a variety of factors, including how open minded you are and how comfortable you are with the plot and the subject matter.  I'm in the middle.  I certainly contest the absurd notion of it being as bad as anime fans make it out to be, on the other hand, I'm also not defending it as an ""underrated masterpiece"" as well.  It falls in between.  It's an abridged, commercialized and entertaining adaptation of a classic dark fantasy/occult work who's appeal is mainly concentrated in the East.

What's frustrating is that English speakers are denied the source material and cultural knowledge which provide the substance that the anime lacks.  The average Western viewer might be entertained and repulsed by the crazy action onscreen, but if his/her knowledge of the cultural references and the original story is nil, then his/her experience will probably be unsatisfactory.  I simply cannot see the anime as being meant to stand alone...I really think it was made as an entertaining spectacle to supplement the original novel.

Thus, the ultimate cure would be to start with the original novel first. But that's not possible (at the moment) in the West as the book has never been translated.  Unless you're fluent in Japanese, you're stuck.  So why bother?? Why waste your time on something you can't finish?

I know there will always be viewers with morbid curiosity though.  If you want to continue and watch the show anyway, then I HIGHLY recommend you gain at least a passing familiarity with these concepts and names before you do:

Concepts:
onmyodo, shikigami, seiman (gobousei), kekkai, Feng Shui (especially the concepts of Energy Veins and Dragons), kodoku (Japanese equivalent of ""gu magic""), Kimon Tonkou, Stone Sentinel Maze,

Names:
Taira no Masakado, Tsuchimikado Family, Abe no Seimei, Eichii Shibusawa, Koda Rohan, Gakutensoku, Torahiko Terada, Noritsugu Hayakawa, Izumi Kyoka, Lagrange, Kannon

There are many more references obviously, but hopefully this quick and dirty layout will provide a framework for most of the story.

Optionally, if you have the patience and a healthy interest in Japanese history and culture, here are some suggestions that I can think of:

1) Buy the SPECIAL EDITION only

2) Do some research on Japanese folklore if you're totally unfamiliar with it. May I suggest reading the book JAPANESE TALES by Royall Tyler? Of course DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS doesn't reference ALL the stories in there; but it does reference many of the tropes found in this collection such as female mediums who converse with the spirits, angry ghosts which are placated into guardian deities, Yin Yang divination (essential), curses, insect magic, the power of bodhisattvas, etc. I can tell you for sure that DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS does directly reference the story ""The Genie"" in the climax of the first episode. If you're a frequent consumer of anime anyway, exposure to these classic stories can't hurt.

3) To complement your research, I would suggest you seek out and watch the feature film ONMYOJI (2001) before you go anywhere near DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS. This award winning live action fantasy film is a much more accessible and very entertaining introduction to the Japanese mythology that DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS references.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Onmyoji-Collection-Onmyoji-Onmyoji-II/dp/B0002IQH9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Onmyoji Collection  (Onmyoji/Onmyoji II)</a>

Although chronologically this film takes place before DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS, the books it was based were (ironically enough) actually written 3 years after TEITO MONOGATARI.

4) Then there's the Chinese mythology angle.  Get some familiarity with the basic mythology of Feng Shui and other mythical topics such as Gu magic, Qimen Dunjia magic, and the Stone Sentinel Maze (from ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS for you ROTK fans out there).

5) Basic overview of late Meiji, Taisho and early Showa era Japanese history.  You could take note of key events and people (especially the ones listed above).  Koda Rohan is historical figure I would definitely check out since he's a major supporting character in DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pagoda-Skull-Samurai-Tuttle-Classics/dp/080483332X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pagoda, Skull & Samurai (Tuttle Classics)</a>

Makes sure you understand the social issues prevalent during these historical periods as well.  There was a lot of anxiety running through Japan's social stratum during the early 20th century and that's reflected in the story of DOOMED MEGALOPOLIS.

6) Watch the documentaries (not the interviews) on the DVD BEFORE you watch
the anime. This will familiarize you with some of the references specific to the story. These documentaries (3 about 20 minutes each) were made partly for this purpose.

7) Now that you've sort of pieced together an artificial knowledge base, you can watch the anime: subtitled Japanese version only!!  Write down the references (names, concepts) you aren't familiar with.

8) Google the references.

9) With this knowledge in tow, watch the Japanese version one more time.

10) Finally, you can watch the live action version of the book TOKYO: THE LAST MEGALOPOLIS as a supplement to the anime.  By itself, this adaptation is actually more compressed and confusing.  However it actually touches upon some plot points the anime glosses over, so it makes an interesting addendum.
