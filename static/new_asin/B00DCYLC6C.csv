I have the big boxed vhs, dvd, and  poster and it's one of my more prized possessions. the turnpike killer will definitely  cement itself as a underground /independent great  slasher.  highly recommended if you are into extremes and no boundaries.",1392336000,,290,5.085106382978723

8592042,3,B00DCYLC6C,"This is the first film from directing/writing duo Evan Makrogiannis & Brian Weaver (who would make the even-better THE SUPER in 2010 with many of this film's actors) and while this shot-on-digital effort has its bumps in the road, such as muddy, grainy photography, some questionable acting, bad sound recording and some lousy makeup effects (not all of them, just a few), this is a fairly absorbing look at a serial killer and what makes him tick. We start with two girls alive in a Queens, New York,  basement full of slaughtered dead naked women, when Jon Beest (Bill McLaughlin) comes down after being awakened by a foreign voice in his head (we will hear that voice often) that says, ""Arise! It is time!"". The two girls plead for their lives and when one of the girls says she ""understands"" him, Jon thinks she means she can hear the voice in his head, so he hammers two ten-penny nails in her head, guts her until her innards falls out, puts her plastic bag-wrapped body in his SUV and drives to New Jersey, where he dumps the body on the side of the NJ Turnpike (hence the title of the film). Next we see Jon meeting a jogging Michelle (Alia Lorea) at a park and she asks Jon if she can use his cellphone to call her boyfriend, since she left her's home to take a run. Jon obliges and then asks her out on a date after she finishes talking to her boyfriend. Michelle tells him she already has a boyfriend and Jon's attitude changes on a dime, so Michelle becomes creeped out and runs away. Jon yells out, ""You got a big surprise coming to you, you little c***tease!"". That night Michelle's boyfriend Nick (Frank DeJesus) gets threatening phone calls on his cellphone saying such things as. ""Hey, f****t, I'm gonna kill you and your slut girlfriend!"". Michelle explains what happened earlier with Jon, so Nick, after chastising Michelle for using a stranger's phone to call him, takes Michelle out for a night on the town. Jon breaks into Nick's apartment and waits for them to come home. Once they do, Michelle takes a shower and Jon beats Nick unconscious and ties him to a chair with duct tape (and delivers one more sucker punch when Nick begins waking up). Jon drags a screaming Michelle out of the shower and torments her in front of Nick (""Give me a b*****b"", which she is willing to do, but Jon pushes her away in disgust. ""Lick my shoes."", which she does.). After playing with the nude Michelle for a few minutes and telling Nick what a disgusting girlfriend he has, he cuts her throat right in front of Nick and then proceeds to remove her internal organs, slapping Nick in the face with what I believe is Michelle's freshly removed liver. Jon has had his fun, so he stabs Nick in the heart and then proceeds to cut Michelle's head off, dumping both their bodies off the NJ Turnpike. Divorced NY Detective Lloyd (Edgar Moye) and his partner are assigned to Nick & Michelle's murder case (they are working in conjunction with the NJ State Police), while Jon patrols the Manhattan-bound PATH train for another female victim. He finds one, chases her into an alley, attacks her (while wearing a mask and a wig), throws her in his SUV, drives home to Queens and then cuts off her head. Jon then meets wannabe Scream Queen actress Maria (Theresa Planell), who is standing on the street PO'ed that her boyfriend hasn't come to pick her up. She accepts a ride from Jon (Uh, oh!), where Jon teaches Maria how to scream like a real Scream Queen. When it becomes a little too real for Maria, she opens the door (a severed female head rolls out) and escapes. Jon hears the voice in his head again telling him to stop, so he hops back in his SUV and heads home while Maria is talking to a crowd of people nearby (""A female head fell out of the car!""). Detective Lloyd, with the help of a NJ State Detective, figures out that the NJ Turnpike's increasing victims are all from New York, but the killer drives to New Jersey to dispose of them, the Turnpike being his preferred dumping ground. The killer must be from New York. Lloyd then beats the NY streets looking for info and gets some important clues from street snitch T-Bone (Brian Manthorne). Meanwhile, Jon picks up hooker Lolly Pop (Brenda Gonzales) on the street. She starts making love to Jon in his SUV when the voice in his head says, ""Kill her! Kill her! Punish!"". Jon knocks her out and brings her to a secluded spot in a park, but she escapes and Jon hunts her down, eventually catching her under a tunnel, stabs her in the mouth and kills her with repeated blows of a pipe wrench, which he then throws into the river. A passing jogger sees Jon's face and runs in the direction he just came from to get away. His face has been seen too many times for him not to eventually get caught. Jennifer tells Donnie that Jon is stalking her, so Donnie invites Jon over for a talk. When Jon tells Donnie that Jennifer is his ""sign"", Donnie flips out and tells Jon to get out and never come back again. Jon burns Donnie's face off on a hot stove and, as Jon is leaving, he is spotted by Donnie's friend Jarvis (Chris Vazquez), who discovers Donnie's body and calls the police (""My friend's face is missing!""). Jon has left too many clues not to be discovered and Detective Lloyd gets information on Jon and goes to his home, trapping Jon in the basement while he is holding Jennifer hostage. Jon hears the voice in his head again, lets Jennifer go, charges Detective Lloyd and we hear gunshots as the screen goes black. One month passes and Jennifer still has bad nightmares about the ordeal. Her girlfriend answers the door and tells her a female reporter wants to talk to her. The ""reporter"" knocks her out and when Jennifer wakes up, she is tied naked to an altar while a mysterious hood-wearing cult surrounds her. The head of the cult turns out to be Jon's father (Demetri Kallas), who was also the voice in Jon's head. Jon was a member of this cult since he was a boy and learned to kill women at an early age. His father says, ""You are the chosen! Hail Abraxis!"" as he mounts Jennifer in hopes of creating a new Jon. The film freezes on the father's face and the end credits roll.  My only real complaint about this film is that the sound seems to have been recorded directly from the digital camera, so the farther the person is away from the camera, the harder it is to hear what they have to say (you'll be turning the sound up and down a few times while watching this). Bill McLaughlin is quite good as Jon Beest (I hate that last name, though, but it is hardly mentioned in the film) and Lyndsey Brown is also quite good as Jennifer. The rest of the cast is so-so, especially Edgar Moye as Detective Lloyd, who looks to be a good ten years younger than any detective I have seen. Besides a few wonky special effects, most of the guttings, beheading, etc. are very well done and quite accomplished (and all were done practically; no CGI) for a film that most probably had a budget that wouldn't feed a family of four for a month. I'd keep on the lookout for both Evan Makrogiannis & Brian Weaver, because I see nothing but good things in their future (At the time this review was posted, they were working on two new films). Some of the locations in this film looked very familiar to me because a lot of it was shot in Clifton, NJ, a mere three miles from where I live. It was also shot on location in Queens, New York and various other locations in NY & NJ. This film was finished in 2009 and had various boutique VHS & DVD releases until Wild Eye Releasing picked it it for a nationwide DVD release in 2014. If you are slightly adventurous and like ultra-low-budget gore films with an actual plot, you could do a lot worse than this one. Also starring Niki Rubin, Manoush, Javier Marquez, Lynn Hazelman and Christian McAteer. A Wild Eye Releasing DVD Release. Not Rated.",1434499200,2,7840,4.439972241498959

8592047,5,B00DCYLC6C,"If you are a fan of the old school horror films of the 80's that were brutal, twisted and gory then look no further cause The Turnpike Killer delivers and then some.
The film tells the story Jon Beest at first you think he's a nice guy but as the film progress you see his nasty side as he butchers his victims without an ounce of mercy and it's down to a Detective to find and stop him before he kills again

The Turnpike Killers screams 80's horror and it makes a refreshing change to see some old school horror among all the big budget horror films that studios have been giving us. The film is well directed, well told and cast involved all does a fine job at the roles they play the effects are pretty damn good too and the photography is well made.

All in all I really did enjoyed watching this and it was grim, brutal, gory and above all else enjoyable this film ain't for everyone but that's how a good brutal horror movie should be  and I'm looking forward to seeing the makers of this film will go and do next",1411948800,,1020,4.16751269035533
8592048,5,B00DCYLC6C,"Brutal, gory, and well made.  I saw this a few years ago at Polygrind and loved it.  It was definitely an undiscovered gem and I'm happy to see that it has been picked up by a bigger distributor.  The guy who plays the cop was especially really good.  The killer was really cool and kills a few (naked) chicks.  Check it out, you won't regret it!",1411862400,,346,4.181818181818182
