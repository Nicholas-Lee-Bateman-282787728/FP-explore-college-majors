8735667,3,B0164SVB2C,"I ordered Vol. 1 only to see how he does with the sonatas as I liked his Beethoven concertos with Wiener Philharmoniker which he also conducted from the piano. As expected from a performer of his statue, he played all the notes well. But It certainly is not a spirited performance. Little music making here. Many Beethoven's piano sonatas are ideal medium for a pianist to bare his soul and connect with the audience, but no such luck here.",1482624000,,440,4.582278481012659
8735668,5,B0164SVB2C,"The Austrian pianist Rudolf Buchbinder (b. 1946) first recorded the complete cycle of the 32 Beethoven piano sonatas in 1982.  Thirty years later, in 2012, Buchbinder recorded the cycle again. In August, 2014, Buchbinder performed the complete Beethoven sonatas at the Salzburg Festival.  This was the first time in its history that the cycle had been performed during the Festival.  All told, Buchbinder has performed the complete Beethoven sonatas in recitals nearly 50 times over his long career. He has lived with this music.

This 2-DVD set includes the first two concerts that Buchbinder gave at Salzburg. It will form part of what will be his third recorded cycle of the Beethoven piano sonatas. It is a moving experience to hear and to see Buchbinder's way with Beethoven. The contents of each program are as follows.

Program/ DVD 1

1. Sonata No. 1 in F minor, op 2 no. 1
2. Sonata No. 10 in G major, op 14 no. 2
3. Sonata No. 13 in E-Flat major, op. 27 no. 1
4. Sonata No. 17 in D-minor, op 31 no 2, ""Tempest""
5. Sonata No. 18 in E-flat Major, op. 31 no. 3, ""Hunt""

Program/DVD 2

1 Sonata No. 5 in C Minor, op. 10 no 1
2. Sonata No. 22 in A-flat major, op 26
3. Sonata No. 22 in F major, op 54
4. Sonata No. 4 in E-flat major, op. 7
5. Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, op. 27 no 2, ""Moonlight""

I have heard the sonatas performed in concert and on CD many times, and I have worked to learn to play some of them myself.  This was my first time hearing the sonatas performed in a DVD format. I loved watching Buchbinder perform, seeing the intensity of his facial expressions, his total concentration on the music, and the movement of his hands. There was a sense of a special experience for those in attendance at the Mozarteum, captured as the DVDs frequently showed the audience and its reactions to the performer and the large concert hall. The performance shows Buchbinder's love for music he has played and lived with for a lifetime. With the effects a DVD provides, the music and the performance remains central.

The arrangement of the works on the program is itself highly creative and unusual. Rather that play the sonatas chronologically or by opus number, Buchbinder  juxtaposes familiar and less familiar works, shorter and longer sonatas, and sonatas written at different times. His arrangement emphasizes how each sonata is a living, separate work of its own rather than part of a series of 32 works. The audience is allowed to focus on each sonata and on similarities and differences with time.  Overall, these first two concerts focus on early and middle-period works.  These two concerts begin with the first sonata in F minor. The latest work chronologically is the rarely performed F major sonata, opus 54.

In listening to the programs, I thought of the sonatas that have meant something to me over the years. I was most interested in hearing and watching Buchbinder in the A-flat major ""funeral march"" sonata, op. 26 because I am currently practicing that piece. The C minor sonata op 10 no. 1 was the first Beethoven sonata assigned to me many years ago, while the G major sonata, op. 14 no. 2 also is frequently given to young pianists.  I have always loved the large, spacious early opus 7 sonata in E-flat major which a gifted high school friend performed on local television many years ago. The memory has stayed with me. Buchbinder offers a beautiful, emotional reading of the most famous of the sonatas, the ""Moonlight"" sonata ""quasi una fanatasia"" on the second program and of the lesser known sonata also described as ""quasi una fanatasia"" which appears in the first recital.  I loved the lively performance of opus 31. no. 3, the ""Hunt"", a work which grows on me each time I hear it. The work is of a markedly different character from the ""Tempest"" sonata, opus 31 no. 2 which proceeds it in the recital. I also enjoyed watching and hearing Buchbinder perform the quirky opus 54 sonata, which stands between the ""Waldstein"" and the ""Appasionata"" and is worth hearing in its own right.

The Beethoven sonatas are inexhaustible in the beauty, variety and emotional depth. It was inspiring to hear and see Buchbinder perform these works that he has played with freshness, intensity, and maturity. This is a wonderful DVD set for lovers of the Beethoven piano sonatas. The DVDs were recorded by Unitel Classica and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy
