2001592,5,B0001HAGX8,"I've bought 8 of the movie paks and I really enjoy them. Some are a little crappy, but most are just fine. The silents and some of the earlier movies star people that lived during the civil war. These are not HD but, they are fascinating to watch and to check out whats going on in the background. They are a bargain and just great for any old movie buff.",1178841600,5,355,4.085714285714285
2001593,3,B0001HAGX8,"The HOLLYWOOD LEGENDS 50 MOVIE PACK offers a wide selection at a very fair price. The several genres here span six decades of cinematic history and this diversity alone makes for an interesting box set. The extensive roster of actors in these fifty movies is also quite unique. HOLLYWOOD LEGENDS is a collection that any fan of vintage motion pictures is certain to treasure.

2001594,2,B0001HAGX8,"Mainly want to update Bderoes excellent list to say that my recent set seems to have had three films exchanged for others, so I assume this is now standard for the set -

Gold,

Good News, and

Lets Live a Little

HAVE BEEN REMOVED, to be replaced by -

The Road To Bali w/ Hope & Crosby,

Scarlet Street w/ Edward G Robinson, and

Pied Piper Of Hamelin (1957 TV Movie) w/ Van Johnson.

Roger Moore is still listed on the front cover, but doesn't now appear.

I have to agree with other reviews that this is a poorer set than some others in the series, with a high number of films running at least 10min too short.",1170288000,8,614,4.135593220338983
2001595,1,B0001HAGX8,"i own most of these 50 pack movies,and as i have said most are very good,but,this one is the pits.

  i know for the price you shouldn't grip about quality or the severe edits done to these movies,but other sets weren't edited like this. and the quality of the transfers are far below the standerds that the other 50 packs have been. many more like this and i'll stop buying these sets.",1146009600,,386,4.333333333333333
2001596,2,B0001HAGX8,"I own an outstanding '50 Mystery Classics' where almost every movies was watchable. By contrast, '50 Hollywood Legends' contains was below average collection of movies that I would not want to waste my time on. With the exception of 'The Joyless Street' with Garbo and 'Blood and Sand' with Valentino, I coonsider this a waste regardless of the attractive price. Not recommended.",1117152000,48,379,5.129032258064516
2001597,4,B0001HAGX8,"I own a couple of these ""50 movie pack"" sets and this is my favorite of the lot, mainly because it has more mainstream movies and bigger stars than many of the other sets.  As noted, the print quality is not particularly great but keep in mind you are paying well under a dollar per movie so you can't expect flawless reproduction.  These are all apparently public domain movies; some of the titles can be bought individually elsewhere for $1-10 each but even if you don't watch half of the films you will probably save money buying this set than picking and choosing.  (Also you might want to get this from one of Amazon's ""new and used"" sellers for substantial savings).

There are some rare titles in this set.  I have never seen Hedy Lamarr's post-MGM films ""Dishonored Lady"" and ""Let's Live A Little"" before so I was glad to see them at last.  Among the other hard-to-find titles are ""Affair in Monte Carlo"" with Merle Oberon (alas a  B&W print of a color film), ""High Voltage"" with Carole Lombard (curiously the box totes William Boyd instead of Lombard), ""Monsoon"" with George Nader and Ursula Thiess, ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with Joel McCrea, ""Smash Up"" with Susan Hayward, and the 1970's ""Treasure of the Jamica Reef"" with Stephen Boyd and a young Cheryl Ladd.
I was glad to finally get to see ""Hell's House"" with Bette Davis and ""Heartbeat"" with Ginger Rogers, admittedly two lesser films in their filmographies.  I haven't watched all the films but some of the prints here are significantly better than other companies public domain issues of the movies.  I had earlier bought ""The Snows of Killimanjaro"" at a dollar store and this print is a vast improvement; I bought Gloria Swanson's ""Indiscreet"" on the net quite cheap but that copy was awful, this one is far better.  The prints to the silents ""The Joyless Street"" (Greta Garbo) and ""Blood and Sand"" (Rudolph Valentino) are quite good. I was surprised to see June Allyson's ""Good News"" in this set; MGM films are rarely public domain, that one must have slipped through the cracks.",1113091200,51,2049,4.714285714285714
2001598,2,B0001HAGX8,"On paper, it sounds like a bargain. If the prints used were higher quality, my score would probably double. The noisy, scratchy, dense video and sound is not even the biggest problem here. I can write that stuff off since I grew up seeing films on TV that way. I justified picking this collection up mainly for two films, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" and ""The Klansman"". The latter is unavailable on DVD - most likely due to the political incorrectness of it all. You'll do better buying this from a collector since here it's not in widescreen, but most importantly, it's cut HEAVILY for TV. This is a bad exploitation romp from a major studio (Paramount) and most of the exploitation (aside from frequent use of the ""n"" word) is on the cutting room floor. What's the point? Even still, at least it's actually here. On my copy (which was factory sealed), Frank Sinatra's ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" is not even included! The disk (Disk 8/Side A) that was supposed to have it and ""The Town Went Wild"", while labelled correctly on the disk itself, is a duplicate of Disk 11/Side A (""Heartbeat"" and ""He Found a Star""). What a gyp!

""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" looks like the source used was a 6-hour speed VHS tape...probably worse, actually. A handful of the films suffer similar fate, or are taken from scratchy, thrashed old TV prints. Others are missing title music (replaced by new classical music), including some silent films with out-of-place newer music scores. I find it impossible to believe even the most ardent viewer is really going to sit through a lot of these movies. One disk even locked up on me when I tried to advance to the next chapter, forcing me to power down the machine.

There are some nice moments: ""The Fat Spy"" is a poor-man's beach party flick with Jayne Mansfield and Phyllis Diller (!) and ""Meet John Doe"" is priceless entertainment. The most money this collection is worth is about $10. Otherwise, buy at your own risk.",1109203200,51,1958,4.607449856733524

8012614,1,B0001HAGX8,"I have purchased 50 movie pack before & loved it.  The movies were good, decent condition, etc.  So I decided to try the 50 movie pack of Hollywood Legends.  While there are some good movies: ""Smash-up: Story of a Woman"", ""Penny Serenarde"", etc, most of these movies are cheap B rated movies.  While I do give credit that not all movies are ""Oscar"" worthy, but enjoyable to watch nonetheless, most of these movies were a torture to watch.  Who knew that ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" was a Hollywood Legend.  Come on now, give me a break.  Also, there were a few silent movies on here (if you like silent movies, then this is a plus), and some old TV movie shows that were done on a cardboard stage & you can hear the hallowed halls echo throughout the movie.
  For me, I wish I saved my money or bought another pack, cause this one was definitely not worth it at all.",1239148800,4,870,4.288343558282208
8012615,4,B0001HAGX8,"When buying 50 movies for pocket change you can't expect much. So I'd say I got more than my money's worth.
There are some of the movies that were captivating with good story lines and acting. Some of the movies were quirky but interesting to see how the art of film has changed over the years. And some of the movies I didn't get past the first 10 minutes.
Ranging from the silent era right up to the 1970's with the focus mostly in the 1930's, don't expect digital picture quality or dts 5.1 sound. While not impossible, there is noise in both the picture and sound, coming from old prints. Roughtly 3/4 of them are black and white.
In all, worth your time and money. But you'll get your best value for your time and money if you PLAN on being selective and skipping some of the 50.",1202169600,4,784,4.268456375838926
8012616,5,B0001HAGX8,"Not really going to talk about how ""good or bad"" these movies are (acting/scripts/etc). Personally, I like movies like ""Meet John Doe"".

Instead what I want to do is make a couple of comments about this package of movies that I think many of the other reviewers overlooked:

1 - The packaging of the discs - the package I got consisted of a box with 12 individual cardboard sleeves, each with a single DVD inside. Personally I like this as it seems to have kept the discs secure during shipment. I've bought other multi-disc sets and have never been that impressed with how they were shoe-horned into a single huge clam-shell case. Another thing that I like about the slim sleeves that these discs come in - it makes it really easy to drop one or two of these movies into the pocket of my laptop and/or my portable DVD player case. Also on the sleeves is a short description of each movie - in a very readable 12-pt font.

2 - The number of discs, there are twelve double-sided discs in this collection, with two movies on each side. Why do I think that is important? Mainly because I've bought other sets where a cheaper publisher crammed five movies onto each disc side so as to get 50 movies on five discs. To do that they had to greatly compress the videos which made them have a huge amount of artifacts and pixilation - making them almost unwatchable. The movies on this 12-disc set are of excellent quality, at least as good as possible considering the source material. While there appears to have been some defects in the prints used (scratches and whatnot) there doesn't seem to be any noticeable additional problems introduced from overly compressing the films to get them on the DVDs.

This is the third set of videos from Mill Creek Entertainment that I've purchased; I also bought their ""Drive-In Classics"" and ""Cartoon Classics"" collections. I must say that I've been very pleased with all three sets and look forward to buying more of their collections.",1179705600,9,1968,4.614285714285714
8012617,1,B0001HAGX8,"YES, MANY SAY THAT FOR ITS PRICE THIS PACK MAKES ANYONE MOUTH'S WATER, BUT WOULDN'T BE BETTER TO PAY A LITTLE MORE AND HAVE BETTER IMAGE, GOOD SOUND, AVOIDING CERTAIN MEDIOCRE FILMS? ANYWAY SEVERAL SURPRISES ARE THERE AND IF YOU MAY BE ANNOYED AT WHAT SAID HERE ABOVE, YOU CAN ALSO FORGET IT AND BE CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU DECIDED TO GET.
