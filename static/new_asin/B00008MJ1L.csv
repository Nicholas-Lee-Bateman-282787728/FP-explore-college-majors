1852913,4,B00008MJ1L,I saw it on a pirate (arghh!) web site. Visual wasn't great but okay. Maybe after  they drop the price I will buy it.,1352073600,,117,3.875
1852914,1,B00008MJ1L,"If anyone is interested in this DVD don't waste your money. When I put the DVD in the machine a rectangular box with a blue background and white writing stating ... REGION ERROR. Yes I checked the product information and read the real small print that appeared in the Seller box before ordering and it stated ALL REGIONS. And the Run Time for a complete series is MORE than 83 minutes. Someone just got $45.00 for free. Don't even try to tell me what you shipped was a mistake. Fool me once. Advice for other Amazon faithful who buy products from the ""Other Sellers"" catagory - - DON'T.",1347840000,7,586,4.435185185185185
1852915,5,B00008MJ1L,"Another great show canceled by the hatchet men at CBS after two seasons.  Well - there are 44 total episodes out there if they can be found.  I'd buy it right now if the entire series was being offered.
For those that love this show - check out Threat Matrix (16 episodes on ABC across one season) and The Unit (69 episodes across four seasons on CBS).  Both are very similar and were canceled before their time.  Shows of this type and caliber are rare.",1335225600,20,454,4.305882352941176
1852916,5,B00008MJ1L,"I absolutely loved this series!!  Now, how about getting it on U.S. dvd so that I can purchase a copy.",1299542400,12,102,4.1
1852917,1,B00008MJ1L,Didn't realize that there was more than one version of the show available.  Purchased DVD and tried to watch only to find out that I purchased an incorrect regional version.  Watched the show on TV for 2 years and thought that I would enjoy watching the series premiere on DVD.  Haven't been able to watch because the DVD player recognizes that the video is formatted incorrectly.,1216425600,8,380,4.7272727272727275
1852918,5,B00008MJ1L,"I can't for the life of me, understand why the series ended.
I loved the show & would love to get the whole series.",1214352000,33,115,3.8333333333333335
7985521,1,B00008MJ1L,How can I get all two seasons I bought this and it is not the two seasns just a pilot. Third a rip off where can I get all of it.,1512691200,,129,3.193548387096774
7985522,5,B00008MJ1L,"What was CBS thinking, cancelling this fine drama? And what was NBC Universal thinking, not releasing this on DVD in the US? Just when I was really getting hooked, it is no more. Please release this, not just 83 minutes, but both seasons.",1508716800,,238,4.558139534883721
7985523,3,B00008MJ1L,"DVD is PAL, made for European market. That was never mentioned, but it is not big problem, since I can watch this on my computer. Problem is that I was expecting entire two seasons and I got only 83 minutes??! Or at least one season? Nope:(( 83 minutes is all you get. It plays well, shipping was fine, but I was just expecting to get more. So hard to find this on DVD. Most likely rest is classified  and sitting at Langley:)))) Kidding, but seriously: CBS, release it on DVD, pretty please.",1501718400,,492,4.3478260869565215
7985524,5,B00008MJ1L,Outstanding.,1491436800,,12,12.0
7985525,5,B00008MJ1L,Excellent series.  Would like to be buy the DVD - why is it so expensive?,1458950400,,73,3.8666666666666667
7985526,5,B00008MJ1L,"Just a few episodes from the series, but that's all that appears to be available on DVD or on-line. This show was one of my favorites.  I wish there were more.",1430352000,5,159,4.129032258064516
7985527,5,B00008MJ1L,Loved the show hated it ended way to fast.  would have enjoy ten more seasons.  bought the UK version was able too watch on laptop,1424131200,,130,4.16
7985528,5,B00008MJ1L,"I could not even believe it when ""The Agency"" was cancelled! All of my friends watched it. Such a great cast, most have continued on in other shows. The chemistry between Paige Turco & Jason O'Mara was like nothing I have seen on TV before or since. They did get married, so I'd say it was pretty real. I would love to have the DVD's  of the show, but it is a little pricey.",1393632000,5,374,4.054054054054054
7985529,5,B00008MJ1L,"Authentic!!!
Real people doing an impossible job!
Shows all their mistakes frailties and, heartbreak and, truthful shows the stress this job entails",1384992000,,148,5.7727272727272725
7985530,4,B00008MJ1L,"I want to see this video since I didn't see it the first time. I will buy it even though it is formatted for UK DVD. That is not a problem. You can still play it in your PC whether laptop or desktop. I have played several UK DVDs that way, even one from Germany (it wasn't a PAL format). You simply can play several then have to play a USA DVD so the player doesn't do a permanent switch to UK region.",1360540800,7,401,3.8433734939759034
