8043436,3,B0006U8A8I,"Originally called SOMETIMES A HERO in its initial release, this  somewhat diverting entertainment is passable.  Josh Barker plays a small time hood who decides to go straight but not before he ticks off a crime lord played by Paul Coufos.  Barker's partners, including a somewhat loony Bryan Genesse, aren't sure he's doing the right thing but the main reason is Barker's interest in an ice skating coach (Christina Cox).  The job he turns down involves blowing up the skating arena where his new love's sister is hoping to acquire a tour as a professional skater.  Barker must also contend with his love's psychotic stepfather and an old nemesis (played with awful relish by Darren Shalavi).  Typical car crashes and explosions heighten the slower pace of the film, but Barker and Cox make an interesting couple, so you could do worse.",1124496000,3,836,4.935714285714286
