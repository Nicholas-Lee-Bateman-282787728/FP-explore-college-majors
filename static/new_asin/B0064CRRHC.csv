8492461,5,B0064CRRHC,I got this because of the film selections. I recommend it. I wish some of his other films would be packaged by this company. I'd love to see several of his spy thrillers put together in a collection.,1522022400,,199,4.2631578947368425

8492469,3,B0064CRRHC,"I bought this as a nice compilation of Michael Caine movies.  Unlike most compilations this one has not only a few of his best, but a couple of his worst movies.  And by that I mean the movie itself is terrible, not his acting.  He has a joyful romp in 'Without a Clue',  a short almost cameo appearance in 'Battle of Britain', and a paycheck day in 'Quills'.  'Dressed to Kill' is terrible in other ways than his acting.  'Play Dirty' seems to be
a preliminary for his wonderful role in 'The Eagle Has Landed'.
Caine has the ability to present a character that is in control of a desire to lash out violently.  This he has done in many movies, none better than in 'The Whistleblower'.  And then there is his first great film role, without any hint of a cockney accent, in 'Zulu'.
I thought the price for those two and 'Without a Clue' worth the price, the others just padding,thus the rating.",1490572800,8,893,4.36969696969697
