  Walk through a comic convention with vast mobs of people selling, trading, and sharing with others their love of comics. Stroll down the avenue to Sotheby's in NY where a comic is auctioned off for $75,000. Can you believe it? Take off on a plane to anoter comic con and meet the artists, editors, and inovators of the industry. Welcome to comic land.
  World of Comic Books is not a ""how to"" collect video. It gives you an introduction to the industry, the people who shaped it, the historical forces that impacted upon it and the shear fun in collecting those books that Mom made you through away (they are worth fortunes now). I was intrigued by the vast diversity in the field and was surprised to see how the founders were the innovators of their time. Stan Lee, Jim Shooter, Todd McFarlane and others give their views of the industry and what they see for the future. This is a great introdution to the world of comics.
