2760918,5,B000N7L2DE,This is the best Christmas DVD--good music and light hearted with guest singers like Stevie Nicks.  I was not originally fond of Chris until seeing him live in CA.  He seems to be a nice guy with a kind heart.,1320105600,,209,4.2
2760919,5,B000N7L2DE,I loved watching this during the Christmas season. My husband and friends loved watching it too.  Lots of different moods and arrangement of music.. guests were great esp. Michael Buble.,1264809600,,186,5.2
2760920,4,B000N7L2DE,"Love Chris, but in this video it is irksome that in the first few songs there is a woman's head, literally just her head, over Chris's right shoulder when the camera is stage center on Chris.  She is playing I believe the cello, but you can't really see that until the camera pans away.  Poor stage planning for recording.  It's almost kinda creepy.

Didn't like seeing the dog sloshed and flopped around by Buble, felt really bad for the dog. And the last song you get gypped because they cut away to the credits, would have preferred to have seen the entire song and then the credits.

Enjoyed the Brian Mcknight duo. Herschel has some of the most beautiful guitars and I enjoyed seeing them. He is so talented as is all of the band. Chris has written some brilliant Christmas songs and his CD is hands down my favorite, I can listen to it year round, just wish the few complaints I have were not there so I could give 5 stars.

The DVD is worth owning, great to just sit and watch or have on the TV in the background for parties.",1230336000,2,1032,4.293814432989691
2760921,5,B000N7L2DE,"Koch Vision and Sound Stage presents ""CHRIS ISAAK CHRISTMAS"" (2008) (58 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Christopher Joseph Isaak is an American rock musician and occasional actor --- Isaak signed a contract to Warner Bros. Records in 1984 for his first album Silvertone --- The tracks ""Gone Ridin'"" and ""Livin' for Your Lover"" are from his album, were featured in David Lynch's cult classic Blue Velvet --- Isaak's second self-titled album Chris Isaak was photographed by fashion photographer Bruce Weber. Isaak's contract was renewed in 1988 when Warner Bros. moved him to their Reprise Records label --- His best-known song is ""Wicked Game"" --- Though released on the 1989 album Heart Shaped World, an instrumental version of the song was later featured in the 1990 David Lynch film Wild at Heart.

Many guitarists have thought Isaak's main electric guitar is a Gretsch 6120, however Isaak revealed in a 2002 interview with Acoustic Guitar that it is in fact a one-of-a-kind Gibson --- For my electric, I've got a one-off Gibson version of a Gretsch 6120, a sort of Chet Atkins thing --- They made one of these things and gave it to me to see if I liked it, and I liked it so much I've been playing it ever since --- People told me they thought it was a White Falcon, but it's not. It's just a white Gibson. I don't think they ever manufactured any of the things --- They strung up this one prototype, scratched their heads, and said, 'Huh. Give it to Isaak.'(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

2760922,5,B000N7L2DE,"I am so happy this is finally available on DVD. I saw this on PBS in Dec 2004, I think. I actually taped it. This is such a great show. I have seen Chris Isaak 6 times over the years and this is more proof of what a wonderful performer and song writer he is. And he is funny and humble at the same time. I like the selection of songs. It has the usual cheerful holiday, secular tunes, but I was glad to see that Chris didn't shy away from religion completely (Washington Square, The Brightest Star, Last Day of the Year). So many artists do because it isn't PC.  This DVD -or the CD--can't help but put you in a great mood! ""Hey Santa!"" makes you want to dance and ""You Gotta be Good"" makes you smile.",1226707200,5,701,4.043165467625899
2760923,5,B000N7L2DE,"Having seen the Chris Isaak Christmas show on TV a few years ago and unable to obtain a copy of the dvd, I was delighted to see it was being re-issued for Christmas 2008. A mix of traditional songs plus some great songs penned by Chris - Brightest star / Christmas on TV / Hey Santa / Washington Square / Gotta Be Good - sure to become standards for Christmas in the future.
With guests like Stevie Nicks, Michael Buble and not forgetting 'Rodney' his dog. It's a fun Show! If your an Isaak fan you will buy it anyway. If you know someone who may not have heard of him, maybe you haven't ?! Make this your number one Christmas DVD buy.",1219881600,11,635,4.170731707317073
8175491,1,B000N7L2DE,"Wow, I don't think I've ever watched a Christmas special with less ""goodwill toward men"" or more uncomfortable or offensive.

Mr. Isaak comes off as a complete jerk in this special.  First, he does this duet with Michael Buble of ""Let it Snow"".  Now of course the song is about a couple stuck inside, and most performers could make something fun out of having two guys sing it.  Instead, Isaak starts ranting about how just because he and Michael are standing close to each other, this isn't about them.  He then reels off another two or three homophobic statements until he dedicates the song to ""the cute girl"" in the front row.  Hmm, what about that wedding ring on your finger, Mr. Isaak.  It was so uncomfortable, that you could sense Michael Buble just looking at Isaak in disbelief.

He follows this up about two songs later with a lame ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" joke.  Realize this was recorded in 2008, just two short years before gays would be able to serve openly in the military, not in the 90's when it might have been at least partially topical, if still inappropriate for a Christmas Special.

The music is forced and mediocre, the rest of the show is offensive.  Simply don't buy.",1513900800,,1193,4.580188679245283

Saw him live at an LL Bean (Freeport) concert where he wandered through the crowd, playing and singing---incredible--don't miss one of his performances if he's anywhere near you.",1460764800,,335,4.317460317460317

8175496,5,B000N7L2DE,Anything Chris Isaak & Silvertone is 5 star worthy!! Great Christmas song performances and a fantastic sampling of the concert banter that goes on in all their shows.
