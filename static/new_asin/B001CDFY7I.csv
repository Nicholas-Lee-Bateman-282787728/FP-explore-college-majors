3511110,3,B001CDFY7I,"If you like martial arts and David Carradine, this is a good movie, but it`s not one of Carradine`s best. Unlike the Kung Fu t.v. series (both of them), The Silent Flute or even Son of the Dragon, this movie is a little ""dark"", definately blood spurtingly violent and lacks the spiritual/philosophical link to the martial arts that we associate with Carradine. Still, it IS Carradine, and that makes it worth seeing.",1247097600,,416,4.791666666666667
3511111,3,B001CDFY7I,"As one of David Carradine's last few films to gain wide release prior to his death, it was with some reserve that I - an uninitiated fan to the ""Kung Fu"" hero's work - put the DVD into my player and gave it a watch, well aware that this was a TV production (although you have to admit that, for a moment, the cover looked like a Dragon Dynasty release). One day later, I'm still not sure how much I like the movie, but I can say with certainty that even at age 72 and on a limited budget, Carradine was capable of giving the likes of Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme a run for their money.

The story: set in the mid `30s, White Crane (Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-Two/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume Two</a>) is a caucasian master at a Wudang martial arts school that's attacked by the forces of the ruthless underground gangster/warlord Khan (Kay Tong Lim,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-The-Bruce-Lee-Story/dp/0783226985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story</a>). Left for dead, Crane barely escapes with his life but vows revenge -submerging himself into the Shanghai crime scene in search of Khan. On his quest, he's aided by one of Khan's disillusioned lieutenants (James Taenaka) and an American cabaret songstress (Daryl Hannah,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splash/dp/6305291500/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splash</a>, ""Kill Bill"") searching for her kidnapped brother.

I don't have nearly enough experience in wuxia cinema to be specific, but without a doubt, there is plenty of inspiration and nods to the golden age of kung fu films, particularly in story structure, motifs, and the insane level of violence. Indeed, if nothing else, ""Kung Fu Killer"" lives up to its title for the sheer amount of agony Carradine causes: within the first three minutes of the movie, he's snapped plenty of arms, lopped off many a limb, and even punched a man so hard in the chest that his spine is pushed out of his back (!). By all means, this film pushes the boundaries of television and is certainly not for the squeamish for all of the visceral carnage it has to offer, presented via six fights throughout the movie. With that being said, the hand-to-hand battles really are a mixed bag: though commendable for his minimal use of a stunt double, Carradine looks rather slow on more than one occasion, and despite the liberal bloodletting, only about half of his fights are actually good, with the lazy swordfight of the finale being the definite lowpoint. Luckily, ""Killer"" introduces us to a budding talent in Osric Chau, a 22-year-old student of Crane's whose three fast-paced, technical fights steal the show.

When the action dies down, the movie goes into noir mode, with Carradine walking the sin-ridden streets of Shanghai in a suit and top hat, sniffing out betrayals feigning allegiances to get closer to his target. Director Philip Spink (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-of-the-Unicorn/dp/B0009ETCXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage of the Unicorn</a>) does a darn fine job of presenting the interracially tense atmosphere of coastal China at the time, and for the most part, the cast holds up decently; I thought that Darryl Hannah's role could've been cast better but her singing kind of pulls its own weight, while Carradine lisps his way through his role but is nonetheless redeemed by his commanding screen presence - quite the equal to that of the title character in ""Kill Bill"" (contrary to the IMDb entry, however, he does not play the flute in this film). On a low note, I thought the film had some problems with pacing: though running at a standard 93 minutes, I felt that the story should've been given more time to build and the characters more room to expand, so the final battle would feel a bit less anticlimactic.

As a side note, the great Pei-Pei Cheng (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>) makes a cameo early on in the film - perhaps putting a bit of an exclamation point on how above-average the film has managed to be. While I'm still not a huge fan of the flick, its quality is more than apparent; while I have a feeling that newcomers to the late Carradine's work should start somewhere else, I don't think too many established fans will want to be without this one.",1245974400,13,4607,5.521246458923513
3511112,1,B001CDFY7I,"(1.) Martial arts scenes, techniques and schools were poorly represented & performed. Too much  reliance on obvious blood filled capsules for the mouth and bullets. The breaking prosthetic limbs and poorly created decapitated heads had a laughable effect. The wholly inadequate filming angles and editing made Carradine's lack of skills look even slower and older. Not in the same ballpark/planet as anything Lee, Chan, Li, or Crouching Tiger..., Hero, House of Flying Daggers.
(2.) The low budget of this film was most obvious when initially we are shown a small number of bad guys but when the battles begin it seems as if that number has tripled or even become endless as they are mown down in order to prolong the attention-getting action scenes. Yet when the final scene shows the field of battle the body count adds up to less than what we were first shown. May I suggest some remedial math for the director.
(3.) Daryl Hannah - no point to her role in the movie, in fact you could have erased her scenes and the movie would have moved forward with better fluidity. Her acting was so terrible I was actually feeling sorry for her. Carradine's was not much better.
(4.) Overall the story line was old and tired and disjointed, e.g. some wealthy Singaporean wants to conquer all of China with a poisonous gas he creates in his basement and meanwhile the superpowers of Europe with all their labs and resources were having problems producing the same warfare gas.",1240358400,2,1466,4.794466403162056

3511116,3,B001CDFY7I,"This new Carrantine movie is Not as good as the original kung fu series (1972) which run for 3 seasons and spawned a movie sequel kung fu // the movie (1986) and a sequel series called kung fu // the legend continues (1993) BUT it deserves your attention u movie lovers of carrantine's martial arts movies.
 Carrantine looks old in this movie but still a great fighter who this time battles an evil general who wants to control the country by force.
 An OK movie who deserves your $$$ but be carefull. There is also a sequel called kung fu killer II which is a total waste of time even with Carrantine in it. So avoid that and get this movie which witnessed the return of the kung fu master DAVID CARRANTINE in to the role we all loved him in the past. KUNG FU KILLER...",1224460800,5,770,4.267123287671233

8287206,4,B001CDFY7I,"This interesting (Kung Fu Killer) and action packed DVD stars the late David Carradine and Daryl Hannah, who looks older in this film, but is still a very beautiful woman.  I have always been a fan of David Carradine and used to watch his old Kung Fun T.V series and also loved the movie Circle of Iron;  however I did not realize he made several other martial arts films.

This film takes place in China in 1929 and begins with a scene inside a Wudang monks training temple, where the vicious criminals kill numerous monks including the chief instructor who was White Crane's teacher.  When White Crane's (Carradine)  Kung-Fu teacher is killed by ruthless drug lords he becomes determined to seek justice and joins  forces Daryl Hannah who is a cabaret singer in a gangster's club.

  If you are looking for some great acting this film is not for you, but if you enjoy lots of martial arts action you may want to check out this DVD.  I found it to be entertaining.

8287207,5,B001CDFY7I,"KUNG FU KILLER was one of a dozen or dozens of movies in (mostly) post production when he was found murdered
in Bangkok. The US State Department soon after issued a tourist advisory to keep out of Thailand; notably Bangkok.

This film is mixed bag of anachronisms, typical martial arts mayhem and ersatz Chinese culture, nasty warlord, twisted Shaolin monk mysteries and myths mixed with
lightning-fast martial arts. The spiritual beliefs/aspects in TV's KUNG FU, which this film could have been either inspiration or a rationalization for the blood-letting.

Oh, even a sexy singer played by Daryl Hannah.
She sang pretty good, as good as she looked.

The Shanghai location of KFK is ironic, to say the least. especially Kane on a boldly revenge rampage. The film is rife with ludicrous social and historical inaccuracies.
The only real saving grace of KFK is Carradine's stoic, spiritual monuments. He was a victim of the product's script, direction and apparently, budget restrictions.

If one can see the humor of the juxtapositions and inaccuracies, it can add a star or two, and the over-all action is pure adrenalin.  I'll add three stars for Carradine's
maybe anguished 'the show must go on' presence with the frequent corn, cliches and creative gaffs. It must have been quite a come down from KILL BILL, the TV series
and his so unorthodox career and personal life. It was amazing the grace and drama of his martial arts skills came from his earlier career as a dancer. Just as 'Duncan
McCloud of the Clan McCloud, AKA The Highlander.

I'm keep my KFK DVD has a homage to him. Too bad he hadn't had better scripts and directors like another movie great who just passed on, Peter O'Toole.
Among other off-beat stars I have many of their best films, mostly to enjoy his performances. And at times, eccentric off-screen life. Edit fulfilled. Carradine
still shines.

. . . But complaints that KUNG FU KILLER depicts an older Kane, leading to under five stars (but not many less) is sad. Objections KFK didn't involve Kane wandering from his temple/monastery worse. It was distilled out of his TV adventures seeped in 'Ah, Grasshopper lines', sage wisdom and into a semi-modern parody frenetic Shanghai. Young guy, senior man. His bad-guy KILL BILL triumphs came before this in his rich and often raunchy career. Carradine always was his own man and so took roles at his often bizarre fancy. A maverick of mavericks. It must've been painful to be covered with blood in so many revenge scenes. He'd even been a San Francisco hippy. Overall, he had some great parts.

His career was a real roller-coaster ride. As were his movies. Most always entertaining, the independent and smart
Kane characters were perfect for him, and he for the characters. I really look forward to seeing KFK
to see if his peculiar brilliance still shines...

As soon as the DVD arrives (ordered on 11th, today's the 12th) I'll come back to
edit this high hopes review... (probably will say, 'yeah, 5 star for sure')  rc",1392163200,3,2998,4.8493150684931505
