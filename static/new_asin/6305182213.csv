7884393,5,6305182213,"The VHS tape played well and I don't remember ever having seen 50,000 Breakfast. I don't think the last few '67 shows were as well made but I still enjoyed the interaction between the actors. Too bad Diana Rigg left. She has a real presence on screen.",1376179200,,251,4.361702127659575
