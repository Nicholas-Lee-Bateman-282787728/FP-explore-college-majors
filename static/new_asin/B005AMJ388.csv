4641044,5,B005AMJ388,The old melodrama/horror of these movies is priceless.  I was very pleased with the quality and the combo is some of the best titles of the genre in my opinion.  Really happy with this purchase....,1359072000,2,197,4.6

4641046,3,B005AMJ388,"I had never seen these three Vincent Price horror movies before.  They do not use V.P.'s full range of acting ability , I am sorry to say.  Undoubtably they will live on as a memento of V.P.'s horror career for years to come.",1356480000,,225,4.209302325581396
4641047,5,B005AMJ388,I was surprised by all of the goodies contained in this edition. There are three Tales of Terror and two of them include Peter Lorre.,1355702400,,133,4.36
4641048,5,B005AMJ388,Excellant shape. Plays purrfect. These moviess are portayed as just as the books are written. Borris Karloff & Vincent Price with Peter Lorre did a excellant job in the movie The Raven.,1355356800,,185,4.8125

4641050,3,B005AMJ388,I expected this to be film versions of The Pit and the Pendulum and The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe to show my high school students. Instead this movie is a loosely based amalgamation of Poe's work and so it didn't work for my purposes. It's quite dated but entertaining in a campy way and Price fans will like it.,1353628800,2,311,4.2
4641051,5,B005AMJ388,"These are great shows if you like Vincent Price and I do.
The Pit and the Pendulum is a wonderful classic so is The Raven.
Tales of Terror are some short stories and are great.",1349654400,3,176,4.057142857142857
4641052,5,B005AMJ388,"What movie wouldn't be great with the late great Vincent Price one of the greatest actors of ALL time.

I have seen the majority of Mr. Price's movies (if not all). I am a TCM addict (especially since they can't make movies that can even come close to the classics).

Mr. Price was an Edgar Allen Poe fan and his performance in the movies made from Poe's stories proves this beyond the shadow of doubt.  Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff do these films great justice.

 The Raven; being one of Mr. Poe's most noted stories, was, is and always shall be a delightfully entertaining film (as long as the classic masters noted are in them).  The special effects were great (for that time), Jack Nicholson also has a part in the movie, I think that he was in his 20's at the time, you can spot him easily by his voice....lol.

Once you watch the classics you may find you can easily get hooked on them, as I did.

The Pit and the Pendulum; Another Edgar Allen Poe great.  Once again Mr. Price gives a tremendous performance this time as a sympathetic, deeply emotional man who is unhinged by the sins of his father, sent to the deepest recesses of his mind.

There seemed to be no end to the diversity of Mr. Price's acting ability.",1339977600,10,1254,4.413043478260869
4641053,3,B005AMJ388,"I won't bother reviewing the movies contained, other than to say, if you haven't seen any of Vincent Price's films at AIP, particularly his collaborations with Roger Corman, you're missing out.  This package offers three films, The Raven, the excellent Pit and The Pendulum, and Tales of Terror.

The good news about this package (for those of us used to the decades old MGM midnight movies releases), is that all three films are new, anamorphic encodings of the movies.  The old releases looked godawful, especially when one watched them on a 16x9 widescreen television. All of the films are at least of reasonable, anamorphic picture quality in this presentation.

The bad news is that TGG direct has opted to squeeze all three films onto one single-sided dual layer DVD, and to save space, all are interlaced transfers.  So while these undoubtedly look better than the old outings, they look nowhere near as good as these films could potentially look on DVD.  A missed opportunity, made all the more disheartening by how long we Price fans have had to wait for even this meager upgrade.

Hey TGG and MGM, How about Blu-Rays of the Corman/Price films?  That would get this customer excited enough to shell out yet again for the same product.",1321920000,49,1243,4.85781990521327

The Raven, The Pit and the Pendulum, and the three short stories in Tales of Terror are well scripted and have delightful twists. Although family friendly, these are not recommended for young children.",1465344000,4,454,4.833333333333333

The collection of actors in that movie is amazing. Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Karloff, Nicholson and Hazel Court looking voluptuous as always. The story has little to do with Poe's poem other than the bird itself. You can tell all three movies are very low budget but that doesn't take away from the performances and story telling.

4641089,5,B005AMJ388,"What really impresses me about all three of these movies are the screenplays by Richard Matheson (author of the novel ""I Am Legend"" and several episodes of ""The Twilight Zone""), who manages to stretch Edgar Allan Poe's short stories (and in one case a poem) into full-length feature films. In ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" for example, only the last 20 minutes are based directly on Poe's original story. The preceding 60 minutes are a yarn spun entirely out of whole cloth by Mr. Matheson, who nonetheless captures the spirit and essence of Poe's work. That, I think, is the real genius of these movies.",1420675200,2,602,4.742857142857143

Great special effects for the early 60s long before before all the CGI gobbledygook we have in films today. The ""Pit"" will remain a Price classic. This 3-some dvd would have been better served with the ""Tomb of Ligeia"" in place of ""Tales of Terror"" but then that would defeat the sale of the other Midnight Movies Double Feature available at Amazon.",1405728000,4,603,4.854368932038835

On the other end of the spectrum Tales Of Terror are just that !  The acting and direction more than make up for the lack of high tech effects. The horrific events were every bit as chilling as anything ever put on the screen because of the talent of the cast and directors. Not because of gallons of latex rubber.
  Don't get me wrong!  That came later. And Boy, did we howl !!!!  But these films are among the crown jewels of the AIP Era.",1514505600,,754,4.474452554744525
