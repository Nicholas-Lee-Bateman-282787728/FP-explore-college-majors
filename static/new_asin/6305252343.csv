Volume 3 of the ultimate TV series adds three more  captivating courses in the feast involving the adjustments and shifting  relationships of both she who was ""To The Manor Born"" and he who  was --- To The Manor Bought, as it were.  Penelope Keith continues her  eloquent characterization of Audrey as the untitled blue-blood with the  breedng but not the money against the impressive portrayal of Peter Bowles  as Richard DeVere, the millionaire red-blood with the money but not the  breeding. Episode 8 introduces us to the threatened invasion of the farming  expert from the city (think about that one) and the outdoor man servant  coming indoors as Audrey's temporary butler.  ""According to this, the  butler's duties include brushing and ironing the billiard table, and, in  return, I have to provide him with a new livery every year.  It is just as  well I haven't GOT a billiard table!""Episode 9 takes us into the Tea  Room of the Manor and Richard's valuable antique china collection as well  as Audrey's solution to feeling lonely with non-manor life as she arranges  for all of the local tradesmen to come to her cottage for free estimates.  ""You should go into antiques. You know alot about them.""  ""Only because I grew up with them.  They weren't antiques to us, you  see.  I can remember when the family still used the hand-painted Italian  Magelica dinner service.  Imagine, parting the spinach and finding the rape  of the Sabine women going on underneath!""Episode 10 begins with  ""the departure from the Manor for a day of shooting"" and goes on  to involve us in both the competition and cooperation of the Big Houses  through the Land Owner's Association while dealing with shared problems  including the reputation of each estate, itinerant ""casual  laborers"" (tramps), and pheasant poaching complete with a game keeper.  ""Ever since the Welfare State, there simply haven't been enough  tramps to go 'round.  We should consider it a privledge to have him  here....""There is not one moment of this series that is regretted in  any way.  Each episode increases the enthusiastic anticipation of the next.  It is a delicious feast!!!!!",918518400,8,2313,4.8785529715762275
