Possible spoilers...
Chapter Seven -- The Love Triangle
Touma finally apologizes to Urara and she asks him to bring her to an amusement park to make up.  Touma calls Kieko and she tells him she wants to meet him face to face.  When he meets up with her she's with Kashu who suggests they go on a triangle date.  Komi and Urara look for Touma but find Akimoto instead who invites them out to karaoke.  This happens to be where the other triangle date is taking place.  Urara runs into Touma's karaoke room ... Touma's afraid she might give up his secret.
Chapter Eight -- Mieko's Confession
At the karaoke club instead of giving up Touma's secret, that he's really a cram student, she tells everyone that she's his little sister.  Urara runs away and Komi and Touma chase after.  Next morning Urara tells Touma she wants to meet that night at the ferris wheel.  Mieko and Touma are finally alone and she tells him that she has a long distance relationship with another Keio student currently in Paris.
Chapter Nine -- First Kiss in the Rain
While Touma is pining over Mieko, Urara is waiting for him at the ferris wheel in the rain, he shows up an hour late.  She's not mad and they end up kissing.  While Mieko is thinking about Touma her boyfriend calls.  Next morning Touma tells Urara that Mieko dumped him (even though they weren't ever really going out).",1069804800,,1541,4.543478260869565

Sakura Diaries is a series for someone who doesn't mind seeing the characters so sexually frustrated, you start getting sexually frustrated too...
A love triangle with a horrible end...
Poor Tonma ditches his hot looking cousin(so what? They're cartoons) for a snooty redhead who keeps teasing him.
Urura is too sexy to be waiting around for this blundering fool.
Not only is he a bit lacking in intelligence, but he lies and she becomes part of it to fool this Redhead chick who is engaged anyways....
Blah! Make your friends buy this, then borrow theirs.
It's ok, but that's it..",1003881600,,697,4.629032258064516
7894426,4,630578910X,"Finally, Touma actually talks to Urura. But this leaves Urura very angry so she decides to deliver the final blow by telling Meiko Touma's dirty secret. But whats this? Meiko has a dirty secret of her own too. I'm not going to tell you because it spoil the fun of the DVD. I'd say out of all 4 discs that this one is propably the most boring of the bunch, but you still need to see it because its a drama. You can't stop watching until it ends. Its just that good. Its almost like watching a day-time soap, but not as boring. Anyway, if you have to get one of these discs, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are keeping up with the series and find the story extremely interesting, then pick this up. And by the way, ADV? WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS!",981158400,,743,4.13103448275862
7894427,4,630578910X,"After the freakish twist of the second volume, Sakura Diaries gets back on track with this tape.  There are still some tense moments, but we are mostly treated to what made me love the series, humor and innocent sexuality.  This volume ups the amount of nudity a bit, so this is definitely not for kids, but adult fans of Japanese animation should like this just fine.",970963200,2,368,4.5606060606060606
7894428,5,630578910X,"This tape is a perfect blend of the first two.  It has the comedy of tape one and the drama of tape two.  If you loved the first two tapes get this one now. The story is alot less heart tugging then two, but it actually has some mild nudity (like less then one min.) and I really think it wasn't needed.  The show was fine without the nudity. All the characters are here and a fleshing out nicely.  They are all holding there parts in the story (and Toma is turning into a Golden Boy).  So if you like a sexy(minus the sex) romantic teen drama see this now.",970099200,,557,4.027272727272727
