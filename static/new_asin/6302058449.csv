430123,3,6302058449,"Juan Guarardo(Christopher Rydell) wants to be a famous bullfighter AND marry his sweet innocent Carmen(Ana Torrent). But when he becomes famous, the love of money and power lure him away and alienate Carmen from him. He  grows to shun Carmen as someone beneath him, and leaves her for beautiful  Dona Nina(Sharon Stone). Of course, it is the Dona who has used his love of  fame and fortune to lure him away, and who has seduced him with her wil,  ruining his life/marriage as well as his career-eventually-as he makes more  and more mistakes in his fighting because of the distractions of his  lust/distress when his life crumbles. Usually, I enjoy these kinds of plots  because they are good human interest topics and are true to life. For that  reason, 'Blood and Sand' held my attention well enough. But it was not that  impressive or spectacular to me-a plot with the potential to be  captivating, exciting, and adventurous was made very dry and bland here.  The scenery was not very colorful or eye-catching; most of it was ordinary  and plain. It was mundane, with no real color life to it. The acting was  very mundane, routine, monotonous, and unemotional, particularly from  Rydell. He is not very believable as the broken man whose life is ruined by  lust and greed, though he tries WAY too hard to be emotional and feeling as  he plays Juan. Most of the other actors/actresses are the same way, very  dull and monotonous without a lot of feeling or emotion. I must comment,  however, that Sharon Stone is the movie's strong point. Stone is amazing as  the vixen seductress who cares about nothing and no one except lust, power,  and herself and she is very real in her role. Her facial expressions, voice  tones, and body languages make Dona Nina all too real and convincing. Stone  gives an awesome performance as the bitchy, selfish, and sensual socialite;  she really makes the role. Also, Ana Torrent has a few good moments in some  of her scenes as Juan's wife. If you enjoy these types of stories or just  like watching Sharon Stone, 'Blood and Sand' might keep you sufficiently  interested. But if you're looking for a film where superb acting with  feeling and believability is done by the ENTIRE cast, you might want to try  another film. Those of you buyimg this, have fun.",960768000,4,2294,4.724747474747475
430124,4,6302058449,"If you're a devoted Sharon Stone fan you'll love this film.  The film is LOW budget and with the exception of Stone, the rest of the cast is virtually unknown.  Stone is up to her old tricks with seducing men and  taking control in the bedroom.  The plot isn't the greatest but you're not  purchasing this DVD for the plot...are you?  You're buying it to see ALL of  Sharon Stone....and you get most of it.  If you're grossed out by  bullfighting this isn't a film for you.  The best scene involves Sharon  Stone making love outdoors. Very realistic.  Adult viewing NOT for the  kids.",953942400,17,584,4.5
430125,5,6302058449,"See SLIVER first, but BLOOD AND SAND is a truely great SHARON STONE movie. She plays the bad mistress in this movie! Its about a man's life torn to pieces and his struggle to pull threw after he leaves his wife for his  Mistress, and see later that his mistress walked into the hands of another  man. This is a stunning adaptation of the novel as we see his life crumble,  and his rise to the top. BUY THIS (after SLIVER)! SHARON STONE at  her.......well 3rd best.",945734400,3,464,4.2988505747126435

7821722,1,6302058449,"I bought this dvd some time back, and while it is advertised as being the full length original (113 min), it is in fact the edited (96 min) version. Very disappointing. Beware! I certainly would not have purchased this item knowing that up front.",1373760000,,246,4.613636363636363
7821723,5,6302058449,"I know the two most famous film adaptions of Blasco Ibez`s novel ""Sangre y Arena"": The 1922 version with Rudolph Valentino and the 1941 version with Tyrone Power and Rita Hayworth. And I also know something about Spain and about bullfighting. I stay often in Spain, it's like a second homeland to me. From this point of view I have to realize that neither the 1922 nor the 1941 version even made an attempt to understand their subject. In the 1922 movie the Spanish and their ""fiesta nacional"" are decried in a horrible way. In the 1941 movie, although produced after Hemingways publications, things not really changed to the better. It is very strange if a scene takes place in the bullring of Sevilla but you see a mexican bullring on the screen instead. At least it's strange for someone who knows the bullring of Sevilla and visited some bullfights there.

Javier Elorrieta's 1989 movie is quite the contrary of it's predecessors. It's filmed at original locations. The director is a spaniard himself and naturally knows his country and its customs. The plot of Blasco Ibez`s 1907 novel is transformed into the 1980ies. I myself grew up in the 1980ies and found the portrayal of this time to be realistic. To my mind this movie is quite astonishing. And it's even more astonishing that it could be underrated so much.

It's a shame that the marketing of this movie focuses only upon the sex scenes with Miss Stone. Miss Stone is the most beautiful woman on earth, but with this marketing strategy wrong expectations are created. Expectations which do no justice, neither to the movie nor to the abilities of Miss Stone as an actress.",1358121600,,1637,4.7403508771929825
7821724,3,6302058449,"Not unexpected of a movie from Sharon Stone, not much of a storyline but plenty of explicit sex scenes and bitchiness",1358121600,,117,4.619047619047619

7821726,2,6302058449,"Face it, This was a widescreen movie. On the DVD however, it has been encoded using 1.33:1, the tasteless TV format with only 2 sound channels. I did not read the technical details before i bought it. I think you should read the details. It is like watching a movie with good VHS resolution. nothing more! What have North Americans done to deserve censored DVD versions of European movies. They pay the same price and it is not for public use. Any DVD without 5.1 channel or DTS sound and without anamorphic widescreen dimensions i.e 2.25:1 should be avoided. The stunning beauty of young Sharon Stone makes up for these technical goofs.",1009929600,,637,4.696428571428571
