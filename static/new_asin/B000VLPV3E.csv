8219406,3,B000VLPV3E,"I just watched the Jef Films transfer of ""Love on the Dole."" The video has a nice contrast and a good overall picture. The dialogue was difficult to understand, mainly because of the British accent and fast talking, but also because the audio and video are not precisely synced.

The story is fairly easy to follow, but today's audiences will likely find it slow-moving and rather dull. This production reminded me of ""The Stars Look Down"" directed by Sir Carol Reed. Both are about families who depend upon the coal mines for their livelihood and are struggling with economic down-times. Both are gritty and down to earth---no Hollywood glamour here!

I purchased the DVD solely because of Deborah Kerr, one of the most wonderful and underrated actresses of the 20th century. This film is very early in her career, and she plays her role excellently.",1526515200,,851,4.862068965517241

8219409,4,B000VLPV3E,"The title sounds like this might be a romantic comedy about a newly married couple trying to make ends meet on a tight budget, but instead it is a gritty little film about life in a Manchester, England coal-mining town during the depression. The accents are sometimes difficult to follow, but it's worth giving ths small film a chance. Deborah Kerr, in one of her earliest films, is probably the only familiar name or face, especially to an American audience, and she does very well, especially towards the end of the film when she has to face the reality of her situation and that of her family. Definitely worth your time.",1352246400,3,624,4.63063063063063
8219410,5,B000VLPV3E,"A powerful, poignant drama set in depression-era England, ""Love on the Dole"" examines the crushing effects of unemployment and poverty on a working class family that sinks into despair and degradation as one after another of them lose their jobs and their hopes for a better future.

The script is bleak and bitter, with a distinctly Socialist air.  The entire cast is superb, with top honors going to a young Deborah Kerr, in one of her earliest screen roles.  The only drawback to the film, at least for American audiences, is that it is somewhat difficult to follow the dialogue early on due to the thick accents of the actors.  But this problem disappears as the film progresses and the viewer gets used to the accents.

There are no happy endings here.  The film is gritty and realistic.  It is also very timely given the economic state of the world today.  Highly recommended for those who like intelligent, meaningful films.",1311897600,6,931,4.775
