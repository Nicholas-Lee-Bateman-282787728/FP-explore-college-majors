8570152,2,B00BL3TQCI,"This is a rather good collection of old TV detective shows, but as usual, Alpha Video's production capabilities apparently come with no quality control, as at least one episode is unwatchable. The shows, which are all pretty fun to watch, are available on YouTube for free, though you may have to do some searching for the Follow That Man episode.",1468800000,,347,4.8
8570153,5,B00BL3TQCI,"Four great episodes from four great series of the '50's. Love the old B&W. Martin Kane is the granddaddy show of the bunch, having first aired clear back in 1949! It set the trend for TV detectives. The cover of the DVD case has a photo of George W. Bush!  Can't beat that!  ;-)",1443225600,,278,4.12962962962963
