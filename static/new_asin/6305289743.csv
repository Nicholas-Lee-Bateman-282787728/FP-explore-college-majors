7886804,4,6305289743,"The short films on these discs are chosen from Chaplin's 1914 - 1919 period, the early time of his career. Although they are transfered from mediocre prints, these are probably the best available at this time until planned restorations are completed. Most are available in other collections, but at least 1 may be difficult to find elsewhere. The packaging is nice with full sized cases for each disc. The other reviewers may not think much of this set, but their standards are probably too high. As an experienced viewer of early silent films, the quality in this set is fairly typical of un-restored films made before 1920.",1185321600,2,625,4.850467289719626
7886805,1,6305289743,Please do not buy this collection. Quality as well as the Movies are not good to see/enjoy. Pls don't buy.,1045094400,15,106,4.35
7886806,1,6305289743,"Miserable transfers from what look like battered home movies photographed from a screen.  Titles are not centered, images are blurry-I could go on and on.  Got rid of my copy immediately!  Grab the wonderful David Shepard restorations of the Mutuals instead on DVD or laserdisk, and wait for him to finish the Essanay series, if it isn't completed already. This set is worthless.",971481600,33,379,4.984126984126984
7886807,1,6305289743,"I wish I could give it NO stars, but this is the lowest I could choose.
It's bad when a marvelous comic like Chaplin has his legend reflected like this. These are horrible DVD transfers, so bad, you cannot  understand much of what is occuring in the film. Save your money and put it  toward the Mutuals collection. Or go buy ice cream with it, at least you'll  get some pleasure rather than the pain of watching this garbage.
After  releasing these Chaplins and that shoddy version of 'Metropolis', I doubt I  will ever buy a DVD made by Madacy entertainment again.",948499200,64,565,4.5
