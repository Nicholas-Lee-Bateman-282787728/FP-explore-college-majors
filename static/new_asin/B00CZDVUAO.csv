8587902,5,B00CZDVUAO,"Music is as close to perfect as one can get...but to quote Dali, don't be afraid of perfection, cause you will never reach it, but I am glad there are still people out there striving for  it in their art.  The end will be unintelligible to most, and not surprisingly, the opera goer will prefer the Met's version, but the Met's Parzifal with their neat little resolution of symbols does not ring completely true ...it might be relatively true, but not what the legend of Parzifal was pushing towards.  One has to go through a lot of modern art and thought and be able to grasp the whole space time relationship as well as had the so called 'holy grail' already established within to be able to understand the final representation.",1407888000,,730,4.557251908396947
8587903,3,B00CZDVUAO,"But first of all to the important part - the music. Thielemann's Parsifal is from the orchestrial side the best one can listen to at the moment. The singing is also very good, but does not reach the level of the Metropolitan cast.

But, by Wagner's eternal soul, what is wrong with the ""director"" Michael Schulz and his ""costume designer"" Alexander Polzin? Is there a secret competition between so-called avangarde directors to outdo each other in staging something completely ridiculous and see how far the ""intellectual"" crowd can be driven in commenting with deep and insightful revelations about the performance? Rats in Lohengrin (Bayreuth), Gunther and Hagen at a sousage seller in Communist East Berlin ( also Bayreuth). And now we have a Parsifal where Kundry murders by suffocation the alter Ego of Klingsor ( a dwarf) at the end of the 2nd act and the grail is, you guessed it, a scarf with the purpose to blindfold Jesus at the end of act 3. Nothing makes sense, the costumes are a joke, the set is meaningless in act 2 and 3 and downright ugly in act 1.
I thought that the Parsifal in Bayreuth was strange, but compared to this ""staging"" it is coherent and even brilliant. It is a shame that pepople like Schulz and Polzin get the opportunity to completely destroy such a great work on such a great stage with such a great conductor. But I am sure that I did not understand their concept and that after more than 40 years of Wagner study and many life performances all over the world I am not in a position to have an understanding of Parsifal - so they might say. It does not pain me to say that these two guys gave a new meaning to the here very fitting label eurotrash. I liked the 2012 Chicago performance, I am deeply impressed by the last Bayreuth performance and I personally believe that the last Metropolitan staging is the best I have ever seen!
This performance is just trash, but the singing and the conducting is extremely well. As I always say: ""one can always close the eyes and ejoy the music!"" Never was it more true than with this ""staging""!
Another missed opportunity.....",1401148800,8,2103,4.5782493368700266
8587904,5,B00CZDVUAO,"Stage director Michael Schulz heaps a big load of pseudoprofound nonsense on top of Wagner's feeble-minded Parsifal libretto. However, if you give up all ambition of making sense of what is happening on stage, and resolutely assume that Wagner's sole redeeming value is his music, this BD will procure you four hours of considerable pleasure.
For the soundtrack is extraordinarily good and more than compensates for the stage director's silly affectations. The Dresdner Staatskapelle and the Saxonian and Bavarian Choruses, conducted by Christian Thielemann, play and sing Wagner's beautiful score with exceptional clarity and precision. Johan Botha does not act, let alone look like a legendary medieval hero, but sings his part with a marvelous voice; Michaela Schuster plays and sings the Kundry role innovatively and convincingly; and Stephen Milling's clever and serene Gurnemanz dominates the first and the third acts. Moreover, if one succeeds in forgetting the intended meaning of the symbols on stage, the colors, the lights, the costumes yield at all times a visually very agreeable spectacle.
Since I do not care at all for the plot of this opera --were it not for the music I would happily drop it and the Ring into the trash can of history-- I have assigned five stars to this BD, in the understanding that not a single one of them was earned by Michael Schulz.",1388448000,,1374,5.084070796460177
8587905,4,B00CZDVUAO,"I would give the musical performance 5 stars, but ... the physical production is - er - strange, to be politely charitable. Let me quote the original reviewer: ""Christian Thielemann's musical direction. You really have never heard a Parsifal like this. This is a Parsifal delivered with delicacy and sensitivity, the reduced size of the orchestra not only working for the requirements of the auditorium and the singers, but finding another way to deliver the extraordinary beauty of the compositional elements so that they reveal the true brilliance of the work.""

Very true. It's difficult to believe the stage directors had not partaken of magic mushrooms while attending an Easter mass, as well as reading a poorly drawn comic book edition of the Bible and a synopsis of Wagner's work paying little heed to Wagner's stage setting or stage instructions. The pantomime actors behind the singers are clearly trying to express something which will theoretically remain unclear to the viewer; however, there are some great moments in the pantomime, whether or not an ardent Wagnerite would agree.

The last performance of Parsifal I'd seen was the magnificent Met production during its HD run in movie theaters; so this version, no matter how well performed and sung, was slightly disappointing when considering the visuals. I'll add that because of his voice one does forget Botha's girth as the performance progresses. I'd suspect with his fine singing that in a live performance one would not notice his size as obviously as one does in a video performance.

If you want an excellent musical version of Parsifal, this BluRay presentation fits your desire, despite the strange production. If you want a new Parsifal which is gloriously moving and well staged, I'd suggest you wait until the current Met version with the sublime Jonas Kaufmann becomes available on BluRay.",1384041600,9,1871,5.127868852459017
8587906,4,B00CZDVUAO,"The Salzburg Easter Festival production of Wagner's most enigmatic work is not the most attractive you've ever seen, nor is Michael Schulz's strange take on the work particularly obvious in its intentions.  Even with the use of actors playing doubles of the main characters, their personalities and motivations remain for the most part remote, flat, mysterious and largely lifeless but the production does nonetheless hold close to the themes and the meaning of Parsifal.  The real insights, innovations and illuminations on the work here however are almost entirely on the musical side.  This is very much Christian Thielemann's show, which means that it may not meet the expectations we have of Parsifal, but it is never less than a thoughtful, fascinating and revealing exploration of this remarkable work.

It's a fairly lifeless production though, with little sense of narrative direction, and - critically for this particular work - little in the way of mood or atmosphere.  While the appearance might be a little unsettling, unfamiliar and alienating, it's clear nonetheless that the director's choices do address many of the themes in Parsifal.  There are five young boys and then five young men who shadow Parsifal, a bruised and battered Jesus who appears to be a physical representation of Kundry's curse, and a dwarf actor who represents the evil of Klingsor (who is sung moreover for extra significance here by the same singer who plays Amfortas).  Two almost naked dancers meanwhile clinging to Amfortas are credited as Nike here, who may be representations of the pain that clings to him in his eternal torment.  Whatever the meaning, there are clear references here to youth and innocence, age and experience, death and rebirth, suffering and redemption, and together with the musical expression, the meaning in this imagery does come through in those key moments with immense power.

Much more significant and much more interesting in the expression of the work however is Christian Thielemann's musical direction.  You really have never heard a Parsifal like this.  This is a Parsifal delivered with delicacy and sensitivity, the reduced size of the orchestra not only working for the requirements of the auditorium and the singers, but finding another way to deliver the extraordinary beauty of the compositional elements so that they reveal the true brilliance of the work.  Thielemann's conducting of the orchestra seems to float and almost evaporate, but it also finds the warmth and Romanticism within the work and still commands tremendous force.  Nothing sounds like a routine account of the work, but every note is carefully delineated, measured, weighted and balanced.  It's extraordinary, the delicacy actually revealing even greater force of expression in this most enigmatic and unique of musical works.

It's not just a matter of toning down the orchestration to prevent it overwhelming the singers either.  All of these singers here are capable of singing with considerably more strength, but the choice seems to have deliberately made to allow them to sing the words softly, sweetly and soothingly, avoiding any sense of declamation.  The sweet tones of Johan Botha are perfect for this Parsifal then, but he moves around awkwardly and the suit is most unflattering for his very large frame.  Michaela Schuster is not a typical Kundry either and difficult to fathom, but her interaction with her own ""personal Jesus"" and with the other characters can be utterly shattering in its intensity.  Wolfgang Koch has a very difficult task by taking Amfortas and Klingsor as a dual role and does tremedously well.  Stephen Milling's soft cooing Gurnemanz lacks the traditional authority and wisdom, but his beautiful timbre and the staging really does bring another dimension out of the character.  It's not how you expect to hear Parsifal then, but it is surprisingly effective.

The High Definition presentation of the opera on Blu-ray from Decca is also exceptionally good.  I don't think the production is well served by the lighting or the filming (Brian Large over-lighting the set and sucking out anything like a theatrical atmosphere), but the image quality is flawless and the audio tracks - LPCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.0 - are superb at capturing the warmth and detail of the orchestration and the singing.  There are no extra features on the disc, but there's a synopsis and an essay in the enclosed booklet.  Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.",1377129600,13,4536,5.189300411522634
