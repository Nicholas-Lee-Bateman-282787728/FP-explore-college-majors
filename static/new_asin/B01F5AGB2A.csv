8760156,5,B01F5AGB2A,"You know that you are in for a heartbreaking story when the documentary starts off with you seeing the subject at hand breaking down in tears. That is what happens with the Scott Hall story...Living on a Razor's Edge. This man is a guy that you keep rooting for because when he is sober, he just oozes all kinds of magic and wisdom. The documentary is a hard watch if you are a fan of Scott's because you feel the pain of him, all of his friends and family telling their horror stories of this man's troubles in life. You get it all with this documentary...his beginning, his ups and definitely all of his downs. You get the story of his frightening encounter with a man that Scott ended up killing. You truly feel his pain, suffering and his overwhelming guilt that this fight ended up with someone losing their life. But, the documentary ends up on a high note that any fan will feel inspired. Tons of matches on here as a bonus. The Blu-ray has more extras than the DVD. Another knock out of the park with WWE and their documentary series! I wish they had more of Scott's mic time in and out of the ring. A cool montage of all the times he said ""Hey yo!"" would've been too sweet!
The steelbook case is very nice and holds the two Blu-ray discs firmly.  Awesome artwork and definitely get this steelbook version if you are a fan of Mr. Hall!",1471219200,,1343,4.308300395256917
