2673085,4,B000JJSKXQ,"Die You Zombie Bastards is a  really dumb movie.  I am a member of that group of people who truly enjoy dumb humor.  There are some laugh aloud parts that I can't mention here because they would ruin the movie but trust me, they are hilarious.  Don't watch this movie thinking it is a horor movie, because it's not.  There is only one scene that is sort of stomach turning, the rest is pure camp.  The only one that can act their way out of a paper bag is the female lead.  The rest of the actors ham it up like they were sniffing helium.  If you enjoyed such Troma movies as Class of Nuke 'Em High or The Killer Condom, this movie is for you.  If you think those kind of movies are dumb, run, don't walk away from this one.",1173484800,13,724,4.042253521126761
2673120,3,B000JJSKXQ,"This movie is bad, but in a good may if you have a very morbid sense of humor and view it for what it is. I had bought a used copy of this movie in 2007 because one of my college professors had co wrote, co produced and had done a little directing for the hodgepodge pile of dung of a B movie. I do actual mean that in a good way though. Its just like any John Waters movie. it is what it is and it its contents has no redeeming qualities at any point in this film. The writer/directors/producers know this is a pile of crap and they're not going to apologies for it. They did what they set out to do and that is to make a bad film.

2673122,5,B000JJSKXQ,"Gave it a 5  just for it being SUCH an outlandish movie.  Low budget  for real  but the thing just rocks (cannot help myself) and is so off the wall -  in no way correct -  or child safe  that Id watch it before Id pop in a Troma film (I and I like lots of Troma films).  The special features were so strangethat they are worth looking at and you can tell from them, that these folks just had a real rollicking good time doing this film and cracking themselves up.  So they did not take themselves serious and it shows in the way they toss themselves into the characters they play.  From the fish monster, to Nefarious, to Red and Peanutch, and the spider blood  you either are watching this with one horribly bemused twisted smile on your face, or staring in disgust and disbelief.  Im the twisted grin type  budget and acting be darned here, even though they did pretty good for DIY.  Just a fun and twisted sick (a good sick) little film that made me compelled  to love it.  I really doubt, you will find this at the video store LOL, not with the title, so if the price looks low enough to take a chance, take it.",1362355200,,1116,4.169014084507042
2673123,4,B000JJSKXQ,"A fine low budget film. You do need a little patience to get past the weird, old dude at the very beginning of the movie, but after that the film takes off.

2673125,2,B000JJSKXQ,"Die You Zombie Bastards! (Caleb Emerson, 2005)

One of the late Jamie Gillis' attempts to break into the mainstream came with Night of the Zombies in 1981. It is such an unrelentingly bad movie that I find it amazing anyone ever cast him in another one. And yet, Gillis' final film role is, yes, in a zombie movie. I grant you, it's a zombedy, which is a much better fit for Gillis than the hardboiled-detective-horror-flick that was Night of the Zombies, but still, you gotta wonder. At least, you gotta wonder until you start looking farther into the cast list.

Die You Zombie Bastards! is the third installment in the ongoing tale of Red (Tim Gerstmar), a serial killer, and his lovely wife Violet (Pippi Zornoza). In this installment, an evil genius, Baron Nefarious (Geoff Mosher, who previously worked with Emerson on Toxic Avenger IV), is raising an army of the undead to do his bidding. Nefarious falls in love with Violet and kidnaps her, sending Red on a globe-trotting trip to hunt her down before Nefarious can recruit her into his army of zombies.

Now, let's get this straight: if you don't like bad movies, you need to avoid this like the plague. I mean, come on, Red wears a superhero outfit made of human skin (with added red long johns and a pair of yellow waders). Hasil Adkins makes an appearance as himself. (He died not long after filming completed, and the movie is dedicated to him.) Red finds himself in a Swedish village containing no men. Lloyd Kaufman hosts a game show called ""Swap Mate"". You know what you're getting into before you even start. Or you should, anyway. This is not classic cinema by any means. But surprisingly, it's actually pretty funny; the script, from Emerson and Haig Demarjian, has some solid comic timing, and while you might feel guilty laughing at some of the jokes, they'll still raise a chuckle. Surprisingly, not released by Troma (Image Entertainment nabbed this one), and with the exception of Poultrygeist, is better than anything Troma's done in decades. Check it out if you're looking for a stupid way to kill a few hours. **",1277251200,3,2089,4.717808219178083
2673126,5,B000JJSKXQ,"Die You Zombie Bastards! is a lo-fi indie horror comedy with a serial killer protagonist (those two things---serial killer and protagonist---should never go hand in hand, and yet here they are!), an odd villian, zombies, dogmen, ninjas, robots, beautiful women, a fishman, a cheese demon, and one-man rockabilly singer/songwriter Hasil Adkins. Red Toole, our protagonist, goes in search of his missing wife, Violet, but not before donning his super hero outfit complete with yellow rubber boots, doo-rag, red jammies, and a cape made of human flesh. Violet has been kidnapped by a bumbling, monster-faced villian, Baron Nefarious, whose strange habits and equally bizarre sexual appetites make him a unique villian indeed. In short, Baron Nefarious has invented what he calls the Zomb-a-tron, which is a laser gun that turns people into mindless, violent zombie drones. That's just his mini Zomb-a-tron, though. His master plan is to complete the jumbo Zomb-a-tron, which will---yup, you guessed it!---turn the entire world population into mindless, violent zombie drones. For Red Toole, otherwise referred to as Redman when in super hero mode, this is an Epic journey, to be sure. He follows clues from one strange set of circumstances to the next, from a mysterious police officer that turns out to be much more to a weird Bahamian obeah man (witch doctor) in the bathtub of a Pittsburg tenement, from a land far across the ocean where only women terrorized by a Cheese Demon dwell to a ramshackle backwoods residence in Wisconsin where Hasil Adkins sits shirtless in a lawn chair, and from a fishing shack where Red learns a shocking secret to the lunacy of Baron Nefarious's hideout where Red battles fiercely to reclaim his lovely Violet. It you like b movie horror comedies or Troma films, Die You Zombie Bastards! is for you.",1262822400,2,1832,5.11
2673127,3,B000JJSKXQ,"""Die You Zombie Bastards!"" (2005) is the latest film I've seen in my Sisyphean effort to review every zombie movie ever made. ""Die You Zombie Bastards!"" is distributed by Troma Entertainment.  For those who recognize that name, you can probably stop reading the review now.  That's all you need to know.  You either like Troma, or you don't.  For those who don't recognize that name, movies that are made or distributed by Troma tend to be terribly written, have ridiculously fake effects, are unapologetically raunchy, and filled with gratuitous sex.  If someone buys a movie with the Troma logo on it, then they should not be surprised that the movie has any or all of the qualities that I listed.  ""Die You Zombie Bastards!"" is no disappointment.  It had all of those qualities, and more.  Simply put, the plot is about a serial killer who is searching for his girlfriend who was kidnapped by zombies.  The zombies are under control of a giant phallused prehistoric-fish-alien-thing, Baron Nefarious.  Or were the fish and the Baron two different characters?  Not that the plot really matters in this movie.

Now to get down to my typical zombie review.  What strain of zombie are these ""Zombie Bastards""? You know that green alien lady from the classic Star Trek?  That's kind-of what the Zombie girls look like...only more naked.  The zombie boys are pretty much the same.  People in green grease paint and wigs.  They are transformed into zombies and are controlled by Baron Nefarious.  The makeup is pretty bad, and the zombies are fairly harmless, so they get a meek zombie rating of 3/10.

There is a lot of gore in the movie, mostly played for comedic value.  Someone went overtime with the latex and rubber cement.  The ""hero"" wears a demented superhero outfit, with a cape made out of human flesh, and a belt with the center bit being some male genitals.  Various bodily fluids are sent flying throughout the movie.  It's all really fake looking, but it's sort-of meant to be that way.  This film gets a zombie gore score of 7/10.

This is a Troma film, so it had more than it's fair share of the zombie movie gratuitous sexism and nudity.  The zombie women are topless most of the time.  On the hero's journey to find his girlfriend, he encounters a field of Swedish women, an all girl bar, and a girl administering herself pain in the background of a weird Jamaican guy's apartment 6/10.

""Die You Zombie Bastards!"" is a bit slow and repetitive at points. The plot is not very consistent, but it isn't really trying to be.  It's more the type of film where the viewer is supposed to sit back and enjoy the idiocy.  Although I realized that, I still found myself reaching for the remote to hit the FF button more than once.  On the boredom scale (0 being insomnia curing, 10 being '78 Dawn of the Dead) this movie gets a 6/10.

The dialogue in the movie is really awful.  Once again, this is not a surprise when someone buys a Troma film, but even for Troma this dialogue is bad.  The acting is even worse.  It's that type of acting where all the performers know how bad the script is, so they go out of their way to perform is as awfully as they can.  This movie gets a 3/10 for having a bad ""even by Troma standards"" zombie movie dialog. +1 point for a great soundtrack that has the required zombie synthesizer, and even some songs by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers.

Overall, ""Die You Zombie Bastards!"" gets a slightly below average 4/10 in my Zombie movie scale.  It's probably not worth buying for the hardcore zombie fiend, unless you really like the Troma type of movie.  It might be worth renting for the more casual undead movie fan, but by no means a necessary watch for a hardcore zombie movie purist.  Considering the film, not on my Zombie scale; rather using a Troma scale, I would probably give this movie a 7/10.",1211155200,,3845,4.580645161290323
2673128,1,B000JJSKXQ,"Save your money and time.

The positive reviews must have been written by people who are making money off the sale of it.  There's no way anyone found humor or sense in this.  It's awful.

If you want a really worthy low-budget bizarre zombie flick, try ""Shatter Dead,"" ""Feeding the Masses,"" or ""Revolting Zombies.""  All three deliver what this title promises.",1195776000,2,360,4.836065573770492
2673129,5,B000JJSKXQ,"DIE YOU ZOMBIE BASTARDS! is all about yelling, violence, and nudity, right in line with all those troma movies(Lloyd Kaufman even manages a voice cameo). We've got a crazy serial killer couple split up by a South Park-esque super villain who plans to turn everybody into zombies. This sends our man Red on a trek all across the world(on a geographically bizarre map) to fight zombies and hear about stories of weird Bahamaian hunters and Swedish cheese demons and all sorts of great things like that.

And there's dogmen. If you love dogmen, just get this already. You can't go wrong with dogmen. Not werewolves. Dogmen. If you think the idea of dogmen isn't so great, then definitely don't buy this film.

The humor's great and never lets up, it's constantly bizarre, and there's plenty of messiness and nudity to satisfy you if that's the sort of thing you demand of your ridiculous movies.",1193529600,4,892,4.785714285714286

8151203,5,B000JJSKXQ,"First of all this movie is complete an utter crap..fair warning. I do find some odd John Waters'ish touches here and there. It also has a Troma vibe to it (i generally don't care for Troma films BTW) . It somehow works if you take it at it's dime store face value... you can expect really awful sfx, and amateur hour film making. Also expect to laugh. you will. The best thing going for Die You Zombie Bastards is Hasil Atkins who inspired such bands as the Cramps, I had never heard of him up till I saw this movie. If Hasil Atkins is the only thing I take away from this movie, it's good enough for me.",1455494400,,604,4.127118644067797

8151205,1,B000JJSKXQ,"Die You Zombie Bastards (2005)
 While watching this wretched piece of garbage, I noted the similarity of Die You Zombie Bastards to some of the worst crap put out by Troma Productions.  Sure enough, director Caleb Emerson worked on Citizen Toxie; The Toxic Avenger IV by the famed low budget film house.  Die You Zombie Bastards does not reach to the status of the entertaining Toxic Avenger films.  It is more closely akin to Poultrygeist, a similarly worthless project.
 The film is repetitive, with the same stale fake penis jokes time after time.  This may be because the film was done over three different years (2001, 2002, and 2003) and the director may have forgotten what he had previously filmed.  The plot is senseless, with space aliens, Zombies, robots, dog headed men and some kind of giant insects all playing some nonsensical role.  Oddly, the film is a sequel to Reds Breakfast: Dawn of the Red (1995) featuring most of the same cast.
 The only thing that sets this film apart from the newspaper in the bird cage of Zombie flicks is its frequent twist into near porn status.  This may be due to the influence of actor Jamie Gillis who is known for his dozens of appearances in porn flicks.  He has a straight dramatic role here as a marooned space being (a different space being from the one who lives an aquatic existence and has a big fake penis.)
 If a leading man who is a serial killer and cannibal in a ludicrous plot with admittedly attractive young women, often painted green, undressing to the max every little while is your cup of tea, you might like Die You Zombie Bastards.  But I doubt it.  Zero brains for this tasteless, classless, humorless, scare-less pile of wasted film.  One hour and 37 minutes that I will never get back.  I do this so you won't have to.",1442534400,,1792,4.588050314465409

2. lots of really sexy naked chicks (if you are a sexy naked chick reading this don't fret there's a big monster cock in there too)
3. its funny as hell the writing is clever and original

5. watch and repeat as needed",1389139200,,676,4.2
