7319758,5,B0112HPVEY,SO excited to finally get this on DVD,1444176000,,37,3.75
7319759,5,B0112HPVEY,"This is a very cute movie that was part of Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas movie line up in 2014. As always, the Hallmark movies are fun and heartwarming to watch.  They help to put me in the holiday spirit every year and this was an especially cute one to watch.

It is the story of a Nicky Talbot (Alicia Witt), a single mother who finds herself unexpectedly unemployed at the wrong time of year is trying to find a way to earn money to give her daughter Becky (T.J. McGibbon) a fun and happy Christmas with at least a few gifts.

Nicky discovers that Cartwright's department store is hiring help for the holiday season and tries to get a job.  It seems like all will work out until Fiona Aldrich (Gabrielle Miller), a senior executive at the store, puts a damper on her plans and turns her down for the job. Fiona has seen her would-be boyfriend, Bill, with Nicky and thinks that he may prefer Nicky over her if given a chance.  Bill is the store manager and is played by Gabriel Hogan.

All is not lost, as a corporate executive (or is he?) by the name of Harry Osbourne (Wallace Shawn) suggests that Nicky become the store Santa and keep her identity a secret from the rest of the workers.  The situations that arise from a young woman hiding and playing an older male Santa are funny and a little unbelievable but this movie is about a little bit of Christmas magic.

The movie was really enjoyable and I especially enjoyed seeing so many familiar faces in the cast.  I've enjoyed Alicia Witt in so many movies and shows over the years (I especially liked her recent appearance on The Librarians.)  Seeing Gabrielle Miller was a real pleasure  I am a real fan of her character on Corner Gas.  Wallace Shawn was a blast, though I kept thinking of various phrases and quotes from The Princess Bride.

I am always pleased to watch Hallmark movies and especially their line up of Christmas movies.  Some are very realistic and some, like this, allow the watcher to believe in a little bit of holiday magic.  It is a movie that all ages can watch and one that I will add to my holiday line up of movies for the future.",1440892800,18,2121,4.402564102564103

7319961,2,B0112HPVEY,"A desperate mother (Alicia Witt as Nicky) seeks work during the holidays.  She hasn't paid the rent.  She has a daughter to raise.  She tries store after store but no luck until she happens on Cartwrights Department Store where they are hiring temporary holiday help.  But.  For reasons never stated, the stores vicious senior VP (Gabrielle Miller) takes an instant dislike to Nicky and refuses her employment.  (The reason for not hiring her is only briefly touched on and it is insane.  Nicky just happens to chat with another employee, Gabriel Hogan as Bill.  Thats the extent of it.  She chatted with a total stranger.  So she couldn't be hired).  Then someone mixed religion with secularism and an angel shows up (Wallace Shawn as Harry Osbourne) and he magically keeps the elevator from going where Nicky needs it to go.  Instead, she ends up in the basement and is magically locked in a dressing room where she dons a Santa suit and tried to pass herself off as a man...............using her voice in a ludicrous imitation of an old man (which shouldnt have fooled anyone).  She looks like a woman in a Santa suit.  For the rest of the movie she is hounded by the suspicious VP who sneers continuously with a flurry of ugly expressions.  And yes, inexplicably, Bill keeps popping up.  They flirt.  He tells the desperate lying single mom that honestly is very important to me.  So naturally, she continues to lie.  And the EVIL VP continues to glare.  Its an odd movie.",1481673600,,1476,4.69140625

There was better chemistry between her and the male lead, and her daughter was adorable.  I also love how this movie felt like an actual Christmas movie.  Most other movies just take place at Christmas but don't have much to do with the holidays.  This one definitely put me in the mood for Christmas.",1455494400,8,475,4.402298850574713

It is about a young girl and her mom, who needs a job and winds up getting possibly the best job someone could have for the holiday season.  I was especially impressed with how well the movie dealt with the problems of kids, and not just her daughter but all the kids that sat on Santa's lap and learned something about themselves.

Highly recommended family entertainment for the holidays.",1450569600,,470,4.63855421686747

One scene in particular when she gets caught in santas changing room she is brought to the boss for ""shoplifting"" the boss lady is told her name, Nicky. ""Nicky?... You're Santa!"" Give me a break.
