7159367,5,B00X65ENPE,"When Downton Abbey ended, I was looking for something to replace it - I missed the costumes and drama...
So I was VERY glad my daughter suggested this series!  Am absolutely loving the story and characters!
(In case you are like me, another favorite title I could suggest is Lark Rise to Candleford)",1463356800,2,299,4.6415094339622645

7159369,5,B00X65ENPE,"Mr Selfridge was the rival in 2013 to The Paradise which began a year earlier. IN 2013 they went head-to-head and Mr Selfridge won, and now continues for its 4th season. Every season of both series is excellent and worth the purchase. Own, don't rent, as this is worth multiple viewings, that good. They deal with the same real story of the man who made the big department store an item of history.
Harry Selfridge continues to be played by Jeremy PIven, flawlessly. He has department store office help in Crabb (Ron Cook) and Grove (Tom Goodman-Hill). Others who have been with this show from the start and continue are Miss Mardle (Amanda Abbington), Frank (Samuel West) Victor (Trystan Gravelle), George (Calum Callaghan), Kitty (Amy Beth Hayes), well the list continues.

New 4th series episodes, aired beginning in January 2016, with the storys beginning in 1928. Lady Mae (Katherine Kelley- all 10 episodes after being gone for 2015) returns to London, and of course Harry gets himself into financial difficulty again with hasty promotional decisions. Grove celebrates his 20 years with Selfridges.
Family dynamics and relationship are played up in episode two and a highlight, or low-light, of the third is an affair of a significant person.
As can be expected, in the typical Selfridge fashion, the store has its ups and downs with more sub-plots and relationship issues than the store has departments. Outsiders get involved, as does Harry, not his first unwise fling. Its more and more of the same old fantastic storylines and believable acting. So many returning characters it is like a family reunion.

I bought and saved and have watched and re-watched every season. Go ahead and pick up The Paradise on DVD and youll see a parallel story, and learn just how GREAT Mr Selfridge had to be to beat out the competition in 2013.
Mr Selfridge is a Masterpiece modern classic, worth more than five stars at our house.

BUT buy individually, at least check the price. Cost as I write this review totals $72.87 individually, but they ask $98.89 for this bundle. Why? And used from Amazon marketplace is even cheaper. You do your own math, but make sure you see Mr Selfridge, all 4 seasons.",1460073600,,2194,4.86096256684492

8715145,5,B00X65ENPE,"This show is freaking awesome!  I absolutely love anything on PBS because they truly make the most visually stunning shows and are right on par with historical accuracy.  The main actor is phenomenal.  He is so wells spoken, so compelling, so interesting that its impossible to not want to know what happens in the next episode.
Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around
Con:
- The fourth season is the last season! 
- I don't get to shop at Mr. Selfridges",1476921600,,800,4.342281879194631
