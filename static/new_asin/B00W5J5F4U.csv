8712170,4,B00W5J5F4U,"1. MITB Ladder Match  This match was good for what it was worth  most of the time ladder matches aren't my cup of tea but there have been some great ones in the past  I would put this one in the okay category as there were some pretty cool spots in it!  My favorite of those was when Randy Orton pulled out Nevilles foot from underneath him while on the ladder and giving him a thunderous RKO!!  Best spot of the whole match!!  Other than that it was just normal guy after guy running up the ladder (knowing somebody was gonna pull him down) then the same old going up the ladder slowly (Kane) and waiting for somebody to grab their foot!  In the end it was between Neville and Sheamus  glad Sheamus won since I think hes the top heel in WWE right now besides Rollins!  Eh  Ill go (7/10).

2. Nikki Bella vs. Paige (Divas Title Match)  I must say this is the best Divas match Ive seen in a long time!  The Bellas are acting like heels again in this match I declare, they switch back and forth from face to heel more times than Big Show!  Well heels or faces the Bellas are still the prettiest girls on TV!!  Anyway  both Nikki and Paige are getting their offenses in Looked like Nikkis been watching old 4-Horsemen matches  she pulls off a great slingshot suplex (shades of Tully Blanchard) and also a spine-buster (a-la Arn Anderson)!  Then later she does her Bob Holly Alabama Slam!!  Cool stuff!!  I went through an emotional roller-coaster towards the end they pull off Twin Magic with Brie (who has fixed herself up to look more like her sister) coming out from under the ring to roll up Paige Paige REVERSES and gets the three count!!!  OH NO  has Nikki lost her title??  Thank goodness Brie pulls her chest-stuffings out and shows the ref the top of her below the belt tattoo, proving she wasn't Nikki so the ref re-starts the match!!  Then one of the best spots of the whole event happens Paige turns around and Nikki charges  hitting a THUNDEROUS Lex Luger Forearm!!!  HOORAY for Nikkis forearm smash!!!  She follows up with a Rack-Attack for the 1-2-3!!!  Another successful title defense for Nikki and a great match to boot!!!  (9/10), oh what the heck  with Nikkis forearm smash Im giving this a (10/10)!

3. Big Show vs. Ryback  eh, I wasn't too keen on this match  first of all it was wayyy too short and 2nd the little pesky fly by the name of Miz interfered right when the match was getting interesting!  I have no clue why Miz wants to get either of these guys mad as they could both whoop him with one hand tied behind their back!  Big Show wins via DQ after the interference, was hoping the ref would re-start the match since Miz made contact with both guys, but no such luck!  (4/10)

4. John Cena vs. Kevin Owens  Okay, this match gives a person a REASON to be a wrestling fan!  Even the non-fan whos just casually watching would be on the edge of their seat watching this masterpiece of a match!  I agree with Owens completely about Cenas gimmick  Ive never liked that hip-hop you cant see me stuff that hes been doing for far too long now!  I do respect Cenas toughness and resilience though!  Well these two guys can do no wrong in the ring!  Theyre working flawlessly in this match, move-for-move with PERFECT timing in their spots!!  Just an amazing match!!  Cena finally wins it after about his 3rd or 4th AA!  Afterwards Cena offers a handshake, but Owens pulls a Chris Jericho/Shawn Michaels moment from WM 19 and kicks Cena out of the ring, then power bombed him on the apron!  Kevin Owens is gonna be a big star and a future world champion!  He reminds me of a young Hugh Morris (Bill Demott) except Owens is about 10 times better!!  Another candidate for match of the year in my opinion!  (11/10)

5. The New Day vs. Prime Time Players (Tag-title match)  Cant say I cared much for this match but it was okay I guess  Xavier Woods took Kingstons place due to Kingston being in the previous ladder match. Big E got his spear through the middle rope in and Darren Young didn't get any offence in at all!  He was getting beat up all over the place!  Finally Titus gets tagged in and is a house of fire, whooping everybody in sight until finally he hits his sit-down power bomb on Xavier and we have new tag-champs!  Not that bad for a short match but could have been much better (and longer)  Ill go (6/10).

6. Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins (WWE title ladder-match)  I thought this was a good match altogether but it seemed like it took forever to get going  they did some silly spots in the opening mins. of the match  Rollins did a suicide dive through the ropes on Ambrose who was holding the ladder  then Rollins played hurt you mean he didn't see Ambrose holing that ladder??  Then they did the round-robin little kids game of who can climb the ladder the quickest  they did the same thing in the MITB ladder match  that seems so stupid to me!  But oh well  at least this match got going at the mid-way point and they started doing cool spots!  Ambrose back-drops Rollins on the ladder which was bridging between the apron and the announcers table  broke the ladder in half!  Rollins winds up putting a good whoopin on Ambrose to try and keep him down, power-bombing him into the cushion on the outside barrier (yeah that really hurts) and stacking chairs on top of him (like that really can keep a person down)!  Ambrose kept coming back and stopping Rollins from climbing the ladder  they both wind up grabbing at the title but Rollins holds on while they both fall off the ladder  so he retains his title, and without any help for a change!  I wouldve liked to have seen more high-risk moves from Rollins, maybe a splash from off the ladder (being the Shawn Michaels Jr. that he is)!  Anyway  this could have been better, but as it was Ill give it an (8/10).
All in all this was a pretty good event  my favorites were Nikki Bellas match, KO vs. Cena and of course the wonderful segment they did on Dusty Rhodes!  (8/10) altogether!",1441843200,2,5968,4.383912248628885

Reviewing: WWE Money in the Bank 2015
Next PPV: WWE Battleground 2015

Bought this WWE DVD at Fry's last Sunday along with Battleground 2015.

R-Truth def. King Barrett - R-Truth, seriously? K-Kwik, R-Truth whatever he's called, he has no business mocking the legacy of the emperor known as King Barrett and that's the pregame show match.

We still miss you Dusty Rhodes, long live the American dream!

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
I've seen better ladder matches than this, but this one is acceptable. Sheamus wins after Bray Wyatt intrudes as Leatherface and puts the unbreakable curse back to Roman Reigns by Sister Abigail.

WWE Divas Title Match
Nikki Bella def. Paige to retain - Controversy once again after the Bella Twins punk'd Paige with Twin Magic. Nikki Bella wins.

WWE Intercontinental Title Match
Big Show vs. Ryback
The Miz ad Big Show have problems once again, well this is how the match ended. The Miz attacked Big Show with microphone first and the fans are screwed now that Ryback is disqualified at final decision, however Ryback retains. The Miz cutting a promo contains Miley Cyrus reference. :(

Kevin Owens (NXT Champ) vs. John Cena (WWE US Champion)
Awesome match, but the winner of the match is the same tired script. Kevin Owens did the right thing by attempting to end John Cena's wrestling career after the match the same he did to Sammy Zayn.

The Prime Time Players are the cool tag team rap superstars who finally won the WWE Tag Team Titles over The New Day, Big E Langston and Xavier Woods.

Seth Rollins def. Dean Ambrose to retain the WWE World Heavyweight Title in a Ladder match after a tug-o-war at the peak of the ending. This match saved this PPV from defecation.

This PPV was acceptable at most, only building up the rivalries for Battleground and then SummerSlam.",1441324800,,1850,4.789308176100629

8712175,4,B00W5J5F4U,"It should be noted that Dusty Rhodes passed away earlier in the week so they started out the show with a 10 bell salute along with a highlight video along with references to him from the talent & commentators & the fans throughout the night.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Neville vs. Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Sheamus vs. Kane - You knew the direction this was going when everyone went for the ladders early as there were plenty of highlights including one man constantly trying to find a way to sneak past the other participants up the ladder, a powerbomb onto a ladder only for another man to be powerbombed onto that same person on top of the ladder, RKO's ""outta nowhere"" onto anyone in sight, the ""altitude era"" coming into effect, one man doing a ""crash & burn"" more than once, bodies flying over the top rope onto a pile of others, and others who got involved in the match as well in a match that you got what's expected from it in terms of spots involving individuals & groups of competitors.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Paige - Both girls started off evenly matched with each girl coming off very aggressive with their offense on the outside such as a cannonball off the apron to driving their opponent into the barricade & apron while getting real physical in the ring from running knees to the face to a spinebuster while each girl grounded the other using submission holds as they traded momentum throughout the contest with each other with both hitting & kicking out of big moves along with each crashing & burning off the top rope at one point resulting in one of the best matches I've seen from Nikki while this was the best Paige has looked since her feud with A.J. Lee with the only downfall being that you understood the direction they were going with finish but it still came off as was overbooked.

Intercontinental Champion Ryback vs. Big Show - The Miz was on commentary for this match as he had issues with both men for weeks as Ryback took the fight right to Big Show taking him off his feet & to the outside in the opening moments more than once while Show used the same strategy of constantly taking Ryback down & to the outside himself as this was one of those matches that was short & solid for what it was but more about furthering a storyline between all three participants.

John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - The rematch from two weeks earlier at Elimination Chamber where Owens shocked the world by gaining not only a RARE clean pinfall victory over Cena but in his debut match on the main WWE roster.  The crowd showed that they were clearly in favor of Owens early as both men were evenly matched early with Owens attempting to use Cena's own offense against him while Cena was able to keep countering big offensive moves into his own as they traded momentum with Cena showing signs of frustration that we haven't seen from him previously whenever Owens kept kicking out of pin attempts to where he would question & lose his cool with the referee as we saw both men use moves that we normally don't see from them from a rana to the code red while both men attempted to go aerial off the top rope at one point as this was an incredible match as Owens got a performance out of Cena that we've seen from others such as C.M. Punk & Daniel Bryan where he was taken to the limit.

Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Prime Time Players - Big E & Xavier Woods defended the championships due to Kofi's participation earlier in the night as they attempted to divide & conquer singling out one of their opponents in their half of the ring with double teaming & frequent tags including a unique way of doing their ""clap therapy"" while applying holds while the Players took advantage of mistiming by their opponents & used their strengths like Titus' power advantage in what was a quick but solid match.

Ladder Match: WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - Both men started out brawling right from the start with the ladder coming into play throughout the match using it in different ways such as executing moves onto it to blocking their opponents offense using it while just using it recklessly in other cases such as such launching it towards their opponent with other weapons used as well such as the steps & chairs to the announce table & barricades around ringside as this fight even went into the crowd at one point as both men used different strategies against the other such as using the weapons to focus on a specific body part to just trying to create enough distance & obstacles away from the ring so they could climb without interruption as this overall was a ladder match that was a very physical fight from start to finish that literally came down to the last second.

The pre-show match was R-Truth vs. King Barrett.  This was another solid show from start to finish with some good action & some standout matches (Ladder Matches, Cena vs. Owens, Divas) so in the end, this is worth checking out.",1435795200,2,4979,4.492817679558011
8712176,3,B00W5J5F4U,"The Money in the Bank Contract Ladder Match: Randy Orton, Neville, Kane, Dolph Ziggler, Kofi Kingston, Sheamus & Roman Reigns wasn't a particularly violent ladder match because there weren't that many crazy bumps, but there were definitely some memorable moments in there. The Divas Title match: Nikki Bella vs. Paige was solid even with the dusty finish. The Intercontinental Title match: Ryback vs. Big Show was a short match with a bad finish to follow up the previous match with a bad finish. The Kevin Owens vs. John Cena match was a fantastic back-and-forth wrestling match of the night. The Tag Team Title match: The New Day (Big E & Xavier Woods) vs. The Prime Time Players (Darren Young & Titus ONeil) was just okay with Young working the whole time before the hot tag to ONeil for the finish. Its a tough spot following Cena/Owens, but at least they did a promo before the match to upset the fans. The World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose was a very good match with a unique finish that is reflective of how WWE is really reluctant to push Rollins as a strong champion. It just lacked that extra something to make it feel special. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1434326400,,1209,4.601851851851852
8712177,4,B00W5J5F4U,"R-Truth vs Wade Barrett: Truth won with a roll up and thought he won the crown but it wasn't on the line.
  Sheamus won MITB after Bray Wyatt interfered and pushed Reigns off the ladder.
  Nikki Bella vs Paige: the Kim Kardashian wannabe had her sister Brie switch with her again. Paige pinned Brie thinking she won. But then annoying Nikki hit her finisher for the win. Paige should have won since she dedicated the match to Dusty Rhodes...
  Big Show vs Ryback (IC Title): Another eh match. The Miz had to be out there for god knows why and he caused a DQ ending by attacking both men.
  Cena vs Kevin Owens: Great match with Cena doing many new moves. But that doesn't mean I still don't find him stale and played out. After Owens won last month; this rematch was made literally 10 minutes later. Just so yes Cena could obviously win. When he puts someone over he has to win every single rematch.
  Cena won after his s***ty stunner followed by a 3rd AA..
  Owens attacked Cena with an apron powerbomb after the match. To set up a 3rd match Cena will also predictably win. Get ready for a career of midcarding after a feud with Cena; Owens.
  Prime Time Players vs New Day (Tag Team Titles): Titus O'Neil won for his team when he pinned Xavier Woods.
  Seth Rollins vs Dean Ambrose in a Ladder match (WWE World Title): In one long ladder match this one helped make the show good. Next to the great but unnecessary Owens vs Cena 2. Rollins for once won with no help what so ever. In one of best ladder matches ever Rollins won when he and Dean fell off the ladder together but he was holding the belt.",1434240000,3,1603,4.311036789297659
