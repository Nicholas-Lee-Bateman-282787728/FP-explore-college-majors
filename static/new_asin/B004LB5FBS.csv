4401124,4,B004LB5FBS,"An underrated Western. Maybe not a great movie, but one that has scenes that impress. Probably Lee Marvin's last excellent performance. Smith, Howard, and especially Grimes give fine performances. Rarely, if ever, have characters deaths been as painful and sad in a Western. I'd forgotten the screenplay was by Ravetch and Frank, two fine writers. I caught this movie on Retro and was slightly more impressed the first time I saw it, when I didn't see the beginning. Seeing it that way may have added to the interest but it's still a movie worth seeing every few years if you hopefully get the chance. There's a short but impressive shoot-out between Marvin and Grimes that deserves to be mentioned, because it's well done and stays with you. And it should be mentioned that Grimes' character not only holds his own against Marvin's, but Grimes stays with him as an actor too. There's a lot of talent in that scene. Old pro Arthur Hunnicutt has a fine scene too. Like I said, the movie's not great, but damn well worth seeing. Paul Marvis is the only critic I've read who praised this movie. Too bad that more critics didn't notice at the time of it's release. Fans of The Culpepper Cattle Company have a good chance of liking this film. Hope they stumble across it. Grimes had a short but worthwhile career.",1384473600,3,1308,4.666666666666667
4401125,5,B004LB5FBS,This is a good old fashioned western with the one and only Lee Marvin. The story is a little bit tragic and yet it has a message which is to stay off the crime stuff. No happy ending but still watchable.,1382832000,2,203,3.975609756097561
4401126,4,B004LB5FBS,"i seen this in theatre as a kid and i thought this was the best movie ever... now that im older its intresting to watch again, and realize i wanted to be an outlaw as a kid too.... but i never was.... i just thought about it. its slow paced but if you notice the details in the settings its pretty true to the old west in everything....gritty yet not too gritty.",1379030400,2,362,4.041666666666667
4401127,5,B004LB5FBS,"I really like this movie it is very well acted and has a very thoughtful plot.  Lee Marvin is at his best playing an outlaw who basically mentors and uses some kids on the run.  The 3 kids are played by Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith and Gary Grimes.  Howard and Smith turn in very good performances, you have sympathy for these kids and the circumstances that put them on the road to crime and hard times.  Gary Grimes is the star of the film and he gives a very solid, nuanced performance in this film  He is a young man who did about a dozen movies in his teens and early 20's and then just disappeared from the business.  Its too bad, he has some real talent.  He was also in another well done western, The Culpepper Cattle Company that you should check out.
Spikes as played by Marvin is not all bad or all good and it is his part of this story that really stirs the pot that helps raise this film above the ordinary.",1369094400,2,924,4.157303370786517
4401128,4,B004LB5FBS,"Though it suffers from the on-the-cheap film style of the 1970s -- bland lighting and too many cheesy zooms instead of dollies, for instance -- ""The Spikes Gang"" plays like a good novel, a drama about growing up and disillusionment rather than a standard rip-snortin' western.  Richard Fleischer, son of animator Max Fleischer and director of one of my favorite childhood films, ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" paints an unsentimental portrait of the old west, even if it retains some of the imagery we've come to expect.

Sturdy Lee Marvin is in fine form here, playing Harry Spikes, the sort of gentleman bandit that children (and even some foolish adults) want to believe is the reality rather than the fiction.  Despite his geniality, he is a realist -- direct, logical, unflinching, and in his own way, honest.  When three boys (Ron Howard, Gary Grimes, and Charles Martin Smith) fall under his influence, it spells the beginning of the end of their innocence.  ""The Spikes Gang"" is the kind of story that rarely gets told anymore, actually showing the consequences of violence, selfishness, and poor choices.  It offers a greater range of emotions than most films do today -- at times, the boys really are on the grand adventure they think they are on -- but it always comes back to harsh center.  In some ways, it's a revisionist western, but ""The Spikes Gang"" really has more in common with the sentiments of Mark Twain, who blamed romantic writers like Walter Scott for filling the heads of boys with foolishness about the glory of war.

In many ways, the film also serves as a critique of mainstream American culture.  It's easy to forget that the Bible-quoting father, for instance, rules his family with a belt and an iron fist, teaching them that love is always accompanied by violence, and that all of the male role models in this film are brutal while all of the women are either untrustworthy or self-absorbed.  The only place where peace even seems possible is in Mexico.

Brief scenes with Arthur Hunnicutt and Noah Beery, Jr., highlight this film.  Though Fred Karlin's music is at times intrusive, the emotions of the story generally run true.  Unlike with most contemporary films, where the feelings are gone a few minutes after you leave the theater, this one may stay with you a long time, especially after you experience the ending, as consistent with the film as it must be.",1358985600,2,2399,4.807785888077859
4401129,5,B004LB5FBS,"THE SPIKES GANG IS AN OUTSTANDINGLY DIRECTED AND ACTED WESTERN, WITH UNUSUALLY GREAT ATTENTION TO HISTORICAL DETAIL.  THE DEALER WAS PROMPT, COURTEOUS, AND EFFICIENT, AND THE DVD ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.",1317686400,3,225,5.617647058823529
4401130,4,B004LB5FBS,"Great acting. Great story. A little slow for my taste but a great ending. Film transfer grainy in a couple of spots. If you can buy at the right price,this movie should make it to your collection.",1306713600,3,196,4.324324324324325
4401131,3,B004LB5FBS,"For what it's worth Leonard Maltin is very critical of this film and only gives it 1 1/2 stars. I thoroughly disagree. While it is not Academy Award material I believe any western or Lee Marvin fan will enjoy it. It also has creditable acting roles by Ron Howard, Gary Grimes, & Charles Martin Smith. The 3 latter actors play teen boys who are close friends. They find the Marvin character suffering from gunshot wounds resulting from an attempted robbery. The boys help him hide and feed him while he heals. They subsequently run away from home and are lured into crime by Marvin. This makes an interesting story that kept my attention. I also liked the sets (filmed in Spain) and photography. Using Maltin's four star system I would rate it 2 1/2 stars and you can see here that I gave it 3 stars of possible five. Again, I think any Lee Marvin or western film fan should see this. It is on the Encore Western Channel periodically.",1298592000,8,933,4.4941176470588236
4401132,1,B004LB5FBS,"You don't need me to tell you this 70's western featuring Lee Marvin is worth seeing, but please don't pay $18.00 for a product that should be $3.00.  If the studio is too cheap to give it real release, then don't insult us with a ridiculously high price.  I refuse to pay more than $5.00 for ANY movie that is ""burn on demand"" and won't pay more than $3.00 for something as obscure as this.

The studios have been swimming in our money for years.  They need to understand that they will not be receiving a steady level of profits forever and cannot bilk us at every turn every time some idiot in marketing thinks up a new way to rip us off.  We (consumers) need to make a stand on this or they will continue to fleece us at will.  If you pay it, they will charge more.",1297728000,7,769,4.12751677852349

It is one of those movies that makes you appreciate your life and freedom. My spouse says Uvalde looks nothing like the movie if that sort of thing interests you. Movie may have been made in Spain.

8434215,3,B004LB5FBS,"The Spikes Gang was a western film from 1974. It features an all star cast. Three teenage boys help a wounded bank robber back to health. He leaves them afterward, while later on in the story, the three teens decide to runaway to find themselves seeking adventure. Sadly, the boys struggle to find any work, and are desperate for food that they resort to being bank robbers themselves, although unsuccessful at it as well, with a horrible result. They later meet up with the bank robber who they helped weeks earlier, and he takes them in. He sort of becomes a father like figure to the teen boys through out the film. Sadly, the film ends in tragedy, ultimately resulting in grave consequences. I thought this movie was entertaining, somewhat slow paced on telling the story. I would not say this is an instant western classic either, but its not a terrible movie either.

This film was released as a manufactured-on-demand DVD-R format from the MGM Limited Edition Collection.",1415750400,3,978,4.78698224852071
