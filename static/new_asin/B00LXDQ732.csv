Pixelated edges around opening logo was immediate red flag for inferior processing method.  What did I expect for $8.00?  [Also not widescreen as stated which is OK as original does not appear to have been shot in widescreen.]",1521158400,,379,5.0

8668724,4,B00LXDQ732,"The print was great. As a collector of these old films, I really praise the studios to continue to give the consumer great prints of these classic films. It's really a disappointment to purchase something and you can't view it or understand what's going on. So please continue to digitize films in all of there splendor!!",1485302400,4,321,4.75
8668725,5,B00LXDQ732,"My mom and I watched this decades ago when Jack Palance was alive and seen in other films. By today's standards this ""spaghetti"" barbarian movie would not merit a star. The plot was based on a story that a woman was forced to drink from her father's skull by the conqueror of her kingdom. In making the film in Italy, the Italian actors spoke  Italian while Jack Palance and Guy Madison spoke Engish. I noted in the credits that the actor who portrayed the brother of the conqueror(Jack Palance) had the last name Palance. I sent it to my Mom who loved the surprise that this movie finally it to DVD.",1453507200,3,600,4.405405405405405

St. Vitus dance throughout his performance as the son of Genghis Khan.",1435881600,5,156,4.571428571428571

8668729,5,B00LXDQ732,"This is a rare period piece from the Italian Sword & Sandal genre & one of the movies in that genre with a decent production value. It is not the quality of the 50's, 60's color epics but still a gem as there are few movies covering this time frame or tribes of the Byzantine era.  Its very fun to see a very young Jack Palance doing what he doe's best, playing the bad guy. I don't rate movies by there budgets but by there ability to entertain on that budget & this movie entertains so I was happy to give it 5 stars. But be aware this is not the sweeping Hollywood epic style film but a top notch Spaghetti Sword & Sandal flick!!! Once your aware of that your choice to purchase is easier. This is also not your typical Sword & Sandal flick as it goes a little deeper than usual as far as being more cerebral.  It doe's have some good set design's & accurate early jousting helmet's. The action is typical to the genre & if your not a armchair critic & looking for an afternoon of fun this is right up your alley.  If your looking for the big budget sweeping Hollywood epic period piece then you might want to steer clear.  I am a huge fan of everything sword or historical so I was satisfied with this film, others with a more high standard might feel disappointed.",1415059200,11,1269,4.188524590163935
