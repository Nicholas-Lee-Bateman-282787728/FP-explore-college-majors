8455658,5,B0053TWV0K,we loved this documentary about the movie and book of the same name. this documentary tells the story of Punk Islam following the release of the Novel. It seems so many muslims can identify with not fitting the mold. It seems much of Islam in the USA is dictated by Saudi Arabian imams. really strange and sad. I think every one should watch this for a fuller perspective on what it means to be muslim in america today.,1469059200,,419,4.384615384615385
8455659,5,B0053TWV0K,"In this documentary we go on Tour with a few punk bands and Michael Muhammad Knight, it takes us on an insider look at how Muslims who play Punk are looked at by the outside media and how they are looked at within the Islamic community and how they are trying to find a place within the diverse culture of both worlds. It's wonderfully put together, filmed and a must watch for those who have read the Book, seen the Movie and have an interest in a history of Punk Music.",1407024000,,471,4.186813186813187
8455660,2,B0053TWV0K,"This was such a waste of time and money. A bunch of directionless young fools, trying to act intellectual. There's no identity, just a thorough lack of creativity and originality. I grew up listening to hardcore and punk music, and those shows had so much raw intensity and energy. These kids plain and simple sucked! Walking on the American Flag to get into their freshly painted bus? Really? I'd go to a show of theirs simply to strangle them. Punks? No. Idiots? Definitely!",1357948800,2,476,4.746987951807229
8455661,1,B0053TWV0K,Save your money and time and just skip this documentary on a bunch of rich young muslim men from rich families who drive around in a nice bus that their parents purchase for them. This had nothing to do with finding their identity as muslim men in America as it did with them being boring and wasting their parents money as they moped around. The music they create is also boring and unoriginal. If you want to watch a bunch of spoiled kids waste time then this movie is for you.,1314144000,4,479,4.274725274725275
8455662,5,B0053TWV0K,"The organization that I intern for hosted a screening of the film with great turn-out; sold out theater! This film is not just about Muslim punk rockers going around the country in a beat up bus, or getting in trouble at the ISNA conference; but to me, it was about identity. Identity: both in the form of religious identity and the struggle it can create within a person, but also the identity that is associated with generation.

Although I am not Muslim, I continually saw issues that I could connect to with my own religious journey and my life.  I understood the struggles, trying to find a balance in what seems to be two completely different worlds.

This is a great film to watch if you are interested in punk rock, Islam, diversity, or identity.",1310774400,8,754,4.57037037037037
