7795949,5,155881518X,"I wanted this film so badly that I settled for it on video.  It is late Ray - if you want village nostalgia, stick to the Apu Trilogy.  The story is set in a changing India (albeit now 40 years ago).  Urban versus rural motif runs through it.  Visually stunning.",1331769600,,262,4.18
