7926589,5,B00004Y6BU,This is a wonderful video.  My three year old has been watching it for over a year.  He loves to watch it and it is very interesting to watch.  It is great the way the machines talk.  Would highly recommend for preschool age children.  Would also be a great gift for a preschool or kindergarten teacher to use with a unit on big equipment,1028160000,8,338,4.21875

It's great to be able to sit and watch with him and not have to watch that purple dinosaur [junk]... It's also great to be able to do the dishes too while he watches.
Buy this Tape if your kid likes this kind of stuff.",1023753600,5,319,3.8484848484848486
7926591,2,B00004Y6BU,"When I bought my lawn tractor, my two preschool-aged boys seized upon its instructional video. Two years later, they both still watch that silly thing regularly. They just love it. They sit still and quiet to learn once more about starting the mower, getting an even cut, and unclogging the bagging chute. The tractor video made them notice farm tractors and even construction equipment more and more. So I figured they'd enjoy a video about construction equipment.
Given that the boys put this video into the VCR about once a day, it's clear that they like the *idea* of this video. But they invariably lose interest in it after ten minutes or so. It could be that the distant shots of these large machines don't grab their attention. Also, it could be that the character voices given each machine sometimes seem disconnected from the machine.",1004659200,4,844,4.827586206896552
7926592,4,B00004Y6BU,"My 5 year old son loves this video. I brought it home from the library and now I have to purchase a copy because he won't let me return it to the library. He loves the music and of course all the talking machines are great. If anything, the video is too short. We end up rewinding and watching it over and over and over again.",996019200,2,326,3.9545454545454546
7926593,5,B00004Y6BU,"We have had this tape virtually run continuously for nearly 4 years now.  The humor and silly voices are right up any preschoolers' alley.  Our kids always seek out ""Dozers"" and look for ""Dino"" at any construction site.  Absolutely love this tape!!!!",991785600,,250,4.904761904761905
