6153898,5,B00HCSO9O6,"Did you know that a pound is based on the weight of 5,026 barley grains? Grain made the perfect balance weight for early agricultural societies. Soon stone balance weights replaced the laboriously counted grains. Interesting explanation of our various types of measurement. Strong use of visuals and interesting narration in the program. Perfect for science classes and the inquiring mind.",1451088000,3,389,5.5
6153899,5,B00HCSO9O6,"I borrowed this set of DVD's from my local library, which has an extensive interlibrary loan agreement with 18 other county libraries (sclends.lib.sc.us). It was so good, I watched it multiple times during the two weeks I had it from the library.

VERY INTERESTING LESSONS

This is a wonderful collection of lessons (lectures?) about measurement tracing the history of measurement from the days when there were no measurement standards at all, through the periods where each city or region had their own standards, to the more modern days when measurements were not only standardized worldwide, but where experts got things closer and closer to exact, non-changing standards, like defining a unit of measurement by another standard that cannot change, like wavelengths of light, or weights of specific atoms. (Of course, I still estimate yards with my ""chin to fingers"" standard.

ANECDOTES ABOUT HISTORY

The anecdotal history is wonderful. Can you imagine living in Egypt when the length of a cubit changed every time one Pharoah died and another took his place? I wonder, when a child became Pharoah then grew up, did the length of the cubit change as he grew?

HOW GOOD ARE THESE LESSONS?

I will be borrowing these lessons again in the future, they are SO GOOD. (By the way, ""The Story of Math"" collections are also excellent.)

YOU WILL LEARN THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW

Get these, and learn. Even if you thought you knew all that there was to learn about our measurement standards, you will learn from these very interesting lessons.

6153900,5,B00HCSO9O6,"This is an absolutely fascinating series tracing the evolution of the various systems of weights and measurements. Engineer or not, you will enjoy this series. It begins with people using the length of the arm of a king, to using certain numbers of barley grains, to a platinum meter bar stored in France, to the Space Age, to our modern-day cyber-society. If all of this sounds mystifying, it is because it is meant to. This series will get you thinking about just how important precise measuring systems are in your life, and in the history of civilization .  Anyone will enjoy this series, it would be great for classroom use. I gave this to many engineer friends. A couple of them actually admitted that there were a few things in the series that they had not previously known.......enough said!",1442707200,13,799,4.748201438848921
6153901,5,B00HCSO9O6,"One of the best videos I ever bought. It's both very informative and full of intelligence, a craft that supersedes every presentation that deals with science and math. It is a quadrone of what man is made of, such ability only a Sovereign creator can give and instill to a man. The indulgence of man in matter, numbers, weight and mass has changed the world of man's thinking, judgement and perception. A must copy for those who want to have a better attitude on how we should manage the world, and ourselves. Thank you for the richness of the presentation of this video. i never have imagined is was superb!",1438646400,10,608,4.536363636363636
6153902,5,B00HCSO9O6,"An engaging and clearly written story about the importance and history of metrology.

6153904,5,B00HCSO9O6,"This British feature contains a wonderfully clear exploration of all aspects of scientific measurement. In particular, I enjoyed the production which avoided the irritating jumpy, flashy editing so often encountered in recent scientific documentaries.",1429228800,8,251,6.411764705882353
6153905,3,B00HCSO9O6,I found this presentation interesting but disappointing. I was expecting more science but got more history instead.,1424649600,7,115,5.823529411764706
6153906,5,B00HCSO9O6,"Cave men did it. Astronauts did it. Every top scientist did it. Modern man can't keep up with it.
""IT"" is measurement. This miniseries addresses all 7 fundamental international units of measurement. A brilliant math master, Marcus du Sautoy, brings viewers another astounding science DVD series that is capable of dazzling beginners, and delighting professionals. He's seldom over your head in lingo or vocabulary, so the viewing is educational for all.

THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR EDUCATIONAL LIBRARIES.

 SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 episodes, each about an hour.
Episodes are fully packed with fact, visuals, experiments from past and state-of-the-art.
```` 1- - - TIME AND DISTANCE: Basic measurements from privative time, 17,000 years ago a French cave calendar. Cubit to the world's rulers using body parts as measure standards, as changeable as their reigns. Academy of Sciences in Paris standardizes length (meter) during the Fr. Revolution. Time advances to atomic and speed of light.
```` 2- - - MASS AND MOLES: The definitive kilogram vaulted underground near Paris is losing weight. That is a crisis for measurement throughout the world. Is replacing ""Le Grand K"" with a ""mole"" the answer? So much education, so fast, but in a pleasant way, I went back for a second view immediately.
```` 3- - - LIGHT, HEAT AND ELECTRICITY: Is there a fundamental never changing law of the universe that can be used for a more accurate measurement of heat, light, and electricity? See how far we've already come on Earth. How close to finding better measurement are we in modern science and technology? The historical photos, footage, and facts are amazing; as are the peeks into the future.",1391817600,24,1678,5.028776978417266

Other reviewers have listed the content of the episodes, so I will not do so again except to note that it is a well balanced blend of history and light technical information which tells a coherent story.  I show this DVD to my high school Chemistry I classes.  The students really like and remember it.  The material and presentation are in that perfectly tuned zone where you hear students whispering to themselves ""That is so cool"" again and again as they watch.

8631551,2,B00HCSO9O6,"Gotta admit, this is the most uninteresting science dvd I have seen.  I think there were between 12 - 20 close-ups of the host deep in thought (kinda overkill).  I was actually looking for the thing to end as it approached 50 minutes, then, to my unhappy surprise found there are another 2 whole programs to go.  Compared to PBS and other science/history programs I have purchased - this is the least 're-watchable'.  Perhaps the other 2 are interesting - but probably more of the same.  No interest in viewing them anytime soon.  On the upside - I found where a Meter length comes from.  This could have been a good 10-12 minutes.  50 minutes dragged.  The 12 page viewer guide IS interesting.  Two Stars only because it might be a winner to a different watcher.  177 minutes, 3 episodes",1475625600,4,788,4.557142857142857
8631552,5,B00HCSO9O6,I'm a documentary geek and very un-educated in maths and science. Mr. (Prof.?) du. Sautoy uses both simple and entertaining analogies to make it very understandable. I watched all of his items on Prime and Acorn and also bought a DVD series not available on either of the previous. Would love if he made more! Excellent teacher.,1473465600,,328,4.771929824561403
