8350244,4,B00243FVT6,"A  great companion to the fabulous new movie ""TYSON"" and as usual Charlie asks intelligent questions  and like the film Iron  Mike does not flinch  and  is direct and honest...and the director James Tobeck helps quite a bit. I just saw the film and loved  it and this half hour would make a superb bonus feature  on the DVD but I don't expect it to show up there.",1244332800,,363,4.25
