8491037,3,B0062A5OCQ,I'll try any movie with Daphne Zuniga in it.  It struggles to be just about adequate,1468972800,,84,4.25
8491038,1,B0062A5OCQ,"Worst  movie ever!  I know one of the ""stars"" personally and that is why I bought it.  I thought the plot non-existent and the acting very poor.  The flashes of body parts were stupid and made the film even cheaper than without them.",1426032000,,233,4.348837209302325

8491040,1,B0062A5OCQ,"A story about a narcissistic infantile failing actor who is kept by his hard working executive wife. Unhappy with his life and career trajectory, he embarks on an affair with a self serving manipulative, MAW. Unfortunately people like this do exist. However watching this pathetic excuse of a male wallow around  with his self indulgent , destructive antics and vile behavior is neither funny or moving. This new paradigm of the terminally adolescent kept man as appropriate social dynamic will leave a lot of women reaching for a medicine cabinet, a lawyer's number, or a loaded gun.",1385251200,,584,5.020618556701031

I would rather put my fingers in a meat grinder than watch a second time.",1369267200,,134,4.625
8491042,2,B0062A5OCQ,"An alcoholic, out-of-work actor (Stephen Barker Turner) cheats on his successful TV executive wife (Daphne Zuniga) with a trashy, men-using bimbo (Heather Gordon) he meets at a party. He suffers the consequences for his infidelity, and we, the audience, don't care....

That pretty much sums up ""Seducing Charlie Barker"", a small independent comedy directed by Amy Glazer. The fault with this film lies not with Glazer, who directs very skillfully, nor her talented cast, who are all quite good (including Daphne Zuniga as the scorned wife, Stephen Barker Turner as the loser title character, and the gorgeous Heather Gordon as the bimbo Clea who brings about Charlie's downfall). The problem with ""Seducing Charlie Barker"" is the story and characters themselves---this is a really unpleasant film about some truly despicable people you wouldn't want to hang around with. The film also teeters towards male-bashing as the women have all the power while the men are portrayed as wimps. And we don't care for Charlie Barker either because he is such a jerk. He deserves the outcome he gets. Seriously folks, if a guy is out-of-work and living off his wife's earnings, the WORST thing he could do is cheat on her. He shouldn't be cheating on his wife to begin with, but cheating on her when he's *unemployed*??? Stupid, stupid Charlie....

""Seducing Charlie Barker"" is based on a stage play called ""The Scene"" (and Heather Gordon, in fact, originated the role of Clea in the stage production). This material may work decently enough for the stage, but, for all of it's verbal bite, it just isn't good enough to warrant a film version. It's a movie that basically adds up to nothing. Still, the acting is good and the direction is good, so it's not a total failure, but there's no getting around that the story and characters are weak. If you must see ""Seducing Charlie Barker"", don't buy it, just rent it. You'll probably only watch it once anyway.",1328486400,2,1945,4.908814589665654
