7962343,4,B000066C79,"An emotional tornado sends an actress over the rainbow to find herself.

A kooky paranoid actress, feeling out of place in her life and career, disappears in the midst of filming a $70 million dollar movie, and begins a journey down the bricky road of self rediscovery. On her trail is her therapist/manager, who flies between being bubbles and glitter supportive and evil mean wicked and nasty dictatorial. As she winds her way through the forest of self re-evaluation, she teams up with three unusual individuals who, in teaching her the tricks of their trades, re-awaken her faith in her own brain, heart and courage, and remind her that she knows where her home is...and there's no place like it.

This is a quirky comedy with a unique style, some fantastic double meaning dialogue, and good performances. If you're looking for a different kind of laugh, with cereal filled swimming pools, topical muscle relaxants and bad golf, along with a touch of dreams, follow ""Betty.""

Favorite Line(s): ""Evel Knievel, he was my hero. He helped me through my childhood. I saw him break his back four times!""

""What's wrong with this thing (cigarette lighter)?"" ""It's childproof."" ""Childproof?! A g*dd*mn f*cking scientist couldn't make this thing work!""",1113350400,4,1247,5.038834951456311
