2115785,4,B0002PUGYI,"Serious research went into the making of this set. A lot of DVDs of this kind are so obviously speculation, but these real experts know what they are talking about. Not only are they incredible speakers, they can also back up what they are postulating with real research & data.",1374883200,,278,4.58
2115786,5,B0002PUGYI,I don't usually get dvd sets like this. I'm glad I gotthis one though cause it was a really good deal. I think the other reviewers do a good job of detailing the contents so I'll just say that this is worth your time. A ton of knowledge is coming your way.,1374883200,,256,3.9423076923076925
2115787,4,B0002PUGYI,"This product was perfect, but for a few scratches on the disc.  The narration was clear, concise, and to the point.  The credits at the end rolled a little too fast but the music was great.  The narrators had good deep voices for the purpose.  I recommend it for anyone interested in this topic of ancient history.",1365724800,,314,4.456140350877193

2115789,5,B0002PUGYI,"READER'S DIGEST MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD is a modern visual update of their perennially popular book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WORLD-S-LAST-MYSTERIES/dp/B000S6X3S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WORLD'S LAST MYSTERIES</a>. An  oversized profusely illustrated work first published in 1974, it discusses most succinctly dozens of ancient sites, peoples and customs.

That model was clearly followed by this excellent three-part documentary: lots of interesting film clips accompany well-written narration. During nearly 170 minutes much is covered within each sub-topic. It's a fine program for all students and anyone interested in long ago civilizations. Highest recommendation.

2115790,5,B0002PUGYI,"To those people who wish to enjoy these types of videos: Most documentaries on ancient mysteries subjects regurgetate the same information over and over.  But this Reader's Digest production was a shock; much better than what I expected.  Almost all of the episodes present some new facts, substantiated with scientific evidence, which is hard to find heretofore, even in the Ancient Mystery literature.  For example, conventional old history says that 200000 people built the pyramids. The movie's presentation about why the number was only 20,000 is interesting, to say the least.  Anyway, to those hard core Ancient Mystery fans, this one really does present some new information that is not ""way out there.""  Worth adding to your collection.",1238457600,5,745,5.279661016949152
2115791,5,B0002PUGYI,"I was given this as a present.  At first, I expected it to be much like all the others.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  The cover says ""Unlock History's Oldest Secrets"".  True to it's word.  I was informed, entertained, and inspired to find out more by doing web searches for current day information.  The production is not ""slanted"" in any direction, rather it is factual and brilliantly produced.

A BIG thumbs up!",1137542400,24,419,4.736111111111111

8030631,2,B0002PUGYI,"I was loving this DVD, which was very well produced and seemed to offer new information on old sites, and I was ready to give it five stars.that is, until I came to the section on Chaco Canyon near the end.

I cant say I know a lot about the material covered on this DVD, with the exception of Chaco Canyon. I have visited the site three times, have studied quite a few books about it and the Ancestral Puebloan people it relates to, and have given a number of public presentations on Chaco and other sites from the same culture.

Right in the midst of filming related to Chaco they show part of what is presented as a structure in the canyon and describe a massacre that took place there and related evidence of possible cannibalism. I am familiar with the incident discussed. It did not take place at Chaco Canyon but at another Ancestral Puebloan site called Cowboy Wash. Chaco Canyon is in New Mexico. Cowboy Wash is in Colorado.

The fact that the movie producers went to some lengths to make the massacre happen at Chaco Canyon disturbs me. They did not need to do that. Telling the truth about the massacres location would not have diminished their film. The fact that they knowingly distorted that piece of history, perhaps out of convenience, causes me to wonder if other parts of the DVD have intentional distortions. It shatters my ability to trust that the producers of the DVD are doing their best to present accurate information. Now I don't know if I can trust any of this DVD set to be true.

(This section on Chaco Canyon is labeled Anasazi a long discarded word for what is now referred to as the Ancestral Puebloan culture. The name Anasazi was replaced because its meaning is insulting to contemporary Pueblo people, who are descendents of the Ancestral Puebloans. Unless this film was made before the name change, the use of the name Anasazi is very inappropriate.)",1404691200,22,1886,4.58753709198813
