5300031,5,B009AMAHO8,"The Oogieloves in The BIG Balloon Adventure was a wide-release movie last year that seemed to have flown under my radar. Usually I am pretty up-to-date on all things toddler-friendly, but this somehow was a movie I missed. Fortunately it has been released on DVD only at Wal-Mart and is ready for your toddler's viewing pleasure.

The Oogieloves are a group of live-action, stuffed animals named Toofie, Zoozie, and Goobie and they are in a band together. In this movie they are planning a surprise party for a friend, but lose the balloons. Their adventure revolves around finding the balloons.

This movie works for the toddler crowd, but much older than that and I suspect I'd get an eye-roll. The story is physically interactive as we are told that every time we see butterflies on the screen we can get up and dance, but when we see turtles walk across the bottom of the screen we must sit down. My 2 year old son found this exciting and from time to time he'd jump around to the butterflies.

I was impressed to see how many famous people voiced the characters in this movie. The cast included Toni Braxton, Cloris Leachman, Christopher Lloyd and Jamie Pressly! In the end what really matters is what my kid things, right? Well, my toddler definitely enjoyed The Oogieloves and has watched it a few times since our first screening. All in all I'd classify that as a win!",1360195200,,1376,4.631147540983607

She got up and sang and hasn't stopped asking to see it since she saw it the first time. We would have seen it again if it hadn't been pulled so quickly. I plan on buying it asap for her. I don't really want to get the streaming version but that is all I see available at this time. I'm going to check netflix first!",1360022400,3,450,3.849462365591398

But from the stand point of a parent it is bad! The second time I went I invited a friend with her kids, so we could talk. Not surprising the theater was completely empty both times we went except for our families, of course. I came to Amazon today to see if I could buy it for my daughter. I would have really loved to surprise her with this movie on Christmas morning.",1355270400,2,525,3.9158878504672896

The movie was creative, engaging, and the perfect G-rated kids movie I've seen in a long time. It held her attention the whole time and had a perfect storyline that was easy for any child to follow and understand. The movie is packed with great music, awesome adventures, and a wonderful cast of colorful characters.

5300037,5,B009AMAHO8,"I took my twin nephews (age 6) to see this movie shortly after it was released.  They totally loved it from the moment it began.

This is a 100% kid friendly movie - something which has been lacking both on television and the big screen.

The movie is just over an hour long, very entertaining, kept my nephews attention and, at certain points, encouraged them to participate and get up to dance.  It was wonderful!

So glad it is going to be released on DVD, because it will make a wonderful Xmas surprise.",1348617600,3,507,4.408602150537634
5300038,5,B009AMAHO8,"We saw this film in the theater with my 5 yr. old and 8 yr. old...I have to tell you, they loved it so much that even now, a month later, they're still talking about it and quoting lines from the movie to each other.  They really loved the absolute sillyness of it.  Although it might not be my cup of tea, I feel that this is a movie that's meant to entertain THE CHILDREN and not the adults for once.  It's their movie, for crying out loud, and honestly I think if parents did show up for this movie with their kids, the kids would really get a kick out of it.  Just made me happy to know that they enjoyed the movie, so I felt like I got my money's worth.  Will buy this when it comes out on DVD.",1348272000,2,699,3.8943661971830985
5300039,1,B009AMAHO8,"I didn't see the film. I watched the trailer. It could not hide the dreadfulness it was pitching. It does answer a question, being a massive film flop, ""What if they made a film and no one came."" Okay. Here it is.
  There is a reason it flopped. A film like this, geared to three year olds is not going to attract many willing adults who will suffer in silence for their children. It should have been a straight to DVD venture.",1348272000,6,427,4.195121951219512
5300040,1,B009AMAHO8,"Over Labor Day Weekend, I took my 5-year-old to see the ""Oogieloves"" movie (as in, desperate parent needs something to distract child). There were 11 people in the theater, counting us. My son, of course, adored it. For an adult, however, it's a mind-****ing experience in utter badness!  I found it fascinating the way people find train wrecks interesting. Take the more bizarre aspects of the Wiggles and multiply them by 50, and you get the idea. Things like weirdly colored puppet people, lead characters such as a vaccum cleaner and a throw pillow, a cowboy with bubbles in his pants, a giant tulip, a flying sombrero and people like Toni Braxton and Christopher Lloyd totally humiliating themselves in an incredibly tacky looking production. It cost $20 mil to make, $40 mil to market, and has taken in $1.0 mil so far! I'm part of a historical event -- one of the few people to see in the theater one of the worst big budget bombs ever!

I'm looking forward to the DVD release, actually. My wife wasn't with us in the theater, and she really needs to experience this with us. I only hope she doesn't file for divorce immediately afterwards for spousal abuse...",1348012800,19,1167,4.68780487804878

The movie is also very boring. If you want a good adventure movie to show your toddler, show them one of Britt Allcroft's movies (Mumfie's Quest and Thomas and the Magic Railroad).

5300163,1,B009AMAHO8,"My little girl (then 6) asked to borrow this from the Red Box after seeing a poster for it. She usually likes campy shows, and especially loves the *Wee Sing* series, so I thought she'd appreciate this interactive DVD. She didn't enjoy it at all, and both my husband and I could barely stand this after the first 10 minutes.

We're definitely not movie snobs around here, but the plot was non-existent, the music was nothing spectacular, and it just wasn't a satisfying movie to watch. I thought with the all-star cast, they might be able to make this movie at least watchable, but they weren't enough.",1399766400,2,602,4.626168224299065

5300272,1,B009AMAHO8,"I became fascinated with the bad press this movie got. It must have been the worst rated movie - ever - at least in numbers of visitors it got in theaters. I like mysteries, specifically when they include business models. Here, you have some guy with a much exaggerated ego, Kenn Viselman, who is some sort of self proclaimed genius, a marketing visionary. He is often quoted as the father behind Thomas the Tank Engine and Teletubbies where in reality he did nothing else than distribution in the US.

Oggieloves is the own creation of marketing visionary Kenn Viselman. You have to leave this to Viselman, it introduces some innovation, the interactive movie for very young children. I read somewhere that Viselman applied for a patent for that concept. You can read it in many places, the rest of the movie is beyond pathetic. Though, it is a harmless movie. There is absolutely nothing disturbing happening in the movie, (besides some erotic dreaming of a vacuum cleaner towards a sexy window - I mean your kids won't get this part). No, I find lots of inappropriate content in some teen oriented Disney creations, but this movie is really harmless and pleasant. It kind of leaves the taste like, I want to shoot myself, if I have to sit through another minute of this, but my three kids, 4, 5, and 6 actually enjoyed it.

According to Viselman, he spent $20m making the movie, and another $40m marketing it. Certainly not a ""lean""production. Perhaps his genius comes from how you can spend $40m in the most ineffective manner - I meant this is lots of money to get rid of. Even the $20m for production, where did it go?

The worst for me as an adult was the plump, amateurish way, how the marketing visionary Viselman believes people are just stupid and they will buy whatever you tell them to buy. From the cheap print on the DVD cover, which reads ""the first-ever Oogieloves movie"", to the reemphasizing of the Oogielove brand during the movie - go and buy merchandize. In that sense the movie is an insult to sanely minded parents, more so than the content. The movie itself is a rage - if you are in the right mood: I really cannot believe that this happening... My all-time favorite is Carey Elwes as Bobby Wobbly - I found myself going back to that scene again and again, poor Carey.

I am pretty sure that this movie will go into the hall of fame of movie history - but I am pretty sure that this is not just the first-ever Oogieloves movie - but also the last.",1375056000,6,2473,4.52572706935123
5300273,1,B009AMAHO8,"After renting this movie, I understand why it didn't do too well at the theaters and why most people stayed away from it except those preschool kids who begged their parents to take them to see it. Although this movie allows kids to make a ruckus at the theater, it's a good thing it only stayed there for a week or two. Otherwise, theater employees would be out of a job. That being said, why this movie went to theaters is beyond me. This movie has straight-to-video written all over it. It also didn't have much of a plot. It had a premise like a video game for little kids. Those color-coded creatures would have to get five ""magical"" balloons back to their home before a surprise birthday party begins for a pink pillow. Pillows don't have birthdays. They're not even alive. Plus, whenever they go for a balloon, they have to do musical numbers and they repeat a cheer they do when they finally get a balloon. Not to mention there were other things the movie suggests that were too repetitive for my liking. I even had to make up some decent MST3K-type responses so I wouldn't get bored. Folks, do yourselves a favor. No matter how much they beg or cry, do NOT rent or buy this movie for your kids. Give them Wreck-it Ralph or Toy Story or The Lorax or something but stay away from the Oogieloves.",1372636800,3,1302,4.406639004149378
5300274,2,B009AMAHO8,"Making movies is far more difficult than most will give credit; as such, I tend to be more forgiving that many critical reviewers. That's why I've given this film 2-stars instead of my gut reaction to be far less generous.  Maybe I'm not the target audience... but who is?  Even infants are likely to find this too sophomoric. It's a train-wreck of a film on every level, except, perhaps, production design (which follows the Terry Gilliam School of Hallucinogenic color schemes).",1369094400,5,480,4.91358024691358

That being said, I have always encouraged my son to get up and interact with his shows when prompted by the characters.  He never has.  I was amazed when he spent this entire movie dancing, laughing...repeating words and lyrics.  It was amazing!

5300281,1,B009AMAHO8,"It's probably safe to assume that a lot of the people reading this review had no idea that ""Oogieloves in  the Big Balloon Adventure"" even existed until a few days ago, when it suddenly turned up in the electronics department of their local big box store.  Its theatrical release was very poorly marketed; I remember seeing only one TV ad, which protrayed the Oogieloves as though the viewer should already know who and what they are.  Then it tanked at the box office.  How badly?  Well, it had a budget of around $20 million, and it only barely managed to break $1 million in earnings, making it one of the biggest flops in film history.  Ouch.  It will be interesting to see if it does any better now that it's available for home viewing.

I'm not sure if I want it to.

The bad movie enthusiast in me--who adores ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"", ""Troll 2"", ""The Happening"", and movies made by The Asylum--wants everybody who shares my taste for the charmingly awful to see this movie.  It somehow managed to cost $20 million, but you wouldn't know it.  The tiny sets, little more than glorified dance floors, are minimally decorated.  The body suits used to portray the characters are abysmal: they sag onto themselves in several places, the seams are obvious, and what little puppetry exists almost never works like it should.  Eyes wobble indistinctly.  The mouths are very special: bottom lips jut out, corners droop.  They're always hanging open, too, giving the overall look of a manta ray filtering plankton.  For heaven's sake, the puppets in ""Neverending Story 3"" are better than these things!  There are only a handful of special effects worth mention, and they're all so bad that you may as well be looking at a game produced for the Sega CD or the Philips CD-i.  In fact, even the practical stuff somehow manages to look like this at times.  It makes your eyes water.

Alright, so it's ugly.  What about the story?

Here's the setup: it's Schluufy's birthday.  Schluufy is a pillow.  Don't ask.  He.. she.. it? lives with these creatures.  They're Oogieloves, and their names are Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofie.  They want to throw a surprise party for Schluufy.  Their friend, an upright vacuum cleaner called J. Edgar (Get it?) is on his way with five magical balloons.  Some squirrels startle him (At least, I think that's what happens.) and he lets the balloons go.  The rest of the movie is about the oogieloves (Is this a species?  Is it a name?  Should I be capitalizing it?) wandering around and trying to find them.  That's it.  It tries to set up something sort-of like conflict with the loss of the balloons, but it's so trivial that it really shouldn't count.  There are no antagonists.  There are no consequences.  In other words, we are given no reason at all to care about what happens in this movie.

(Oh, except for the weird pseudo-romantic tension between J. Edgar and a window.  Don't ask.)

The writing is exquisitely lazy.  It's loaded with agonizing dialogue, the stupidest of puns, and embarrassing songs about things like how to climb ladders.  It's supposed to be interactive, but all that really happens is the audience gets told to repeat asinine rhymes (Such as, ""One!  Two!  One, two, three!  Windy Wendy, what do you see?"").  It tries to present itself as a sort of variety show, but what you really get is various celebrities looking confused.  You thought it was embarrassing seeing Harvey Korman in the ""Star Wars"" holiday special?  Wait until you see Christopher Lloyd in ""Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"".  It's awful.

(I do have to say that Cary Elwes as Bobbly Wobbly is a lot of fun to watch.  He clearly knew exactly what sort of movie he was in and was just doing whatever he wanted in front of the camera.  It's a riot.)

""Ah,"" I hear you say, ""But it was made for kids!""  Sorry, but that's not good enough.  ""Sesame Street"" is also made for kids.  The Dr. Seuss shorts were made for kids.  Don Bluth's movies were made for kids.  Most of Disney's animated movies are made for kids.  ""Animaniacs"" was made for kids, which might come as a bit of a shock to those of us who re-watch it as adults.  All of these can be enjoyed by children and adults, too, because they aren't written with the assumption that the target audience is stupid.  ""Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" is.

If you're a bad movie enthusiast looking for something new, sure, give this a shot.

If you're a parent looking for something new for your kids, don't waste your money, your time, or their time.",1360454400,20,4538,4.644388398486759
8538534,1,B009AMAHO8,"I wanted a copy of the Oogieloves movie because I'd heard that it was really stupid....and believe me, in that respect it does not disappoint.
The plot - gathering birthday balloons, some sub-kindergarten song-and-dance, and that's about all - is thinner than a Donald Trump campaign
promise, and the fact that the guest of honor is a talking pillow named ""Schluufy"" guarantees appeal only to those who find Barney the Dinosaur
too cerebral.  The Oogies themselves look like the product of some misbegotten collaboration involving Jim Henson, Sid and Marty Krofft,
and the creators of the Teletubbies (a horse designed by committee ends up as a camel; a Muppet designed by committee ends up as an
Oogielove).  One bit of wit, though - a talking vacuum cleaner named J. Edgar (he's probably a Hoover - ha ha).  In short, this is the most

You can kind of see how it was going for a feature length tv episode with the story. But this... this is not made by people who understand making children's entertainment. Because what they made is a disorienting adventure of some very monstrous and lifeless puppets and they do a bunch of incredibly random and hard to explain things. The movie tries to bully you into dancing and strange times and has a very OCD way of repeating things which is more curious than anything.
