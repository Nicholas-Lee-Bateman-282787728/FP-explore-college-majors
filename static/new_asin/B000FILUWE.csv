2568085,3,B000FILUWE,"I got to check this out on TVOne today, and to be honest I have mixed feelings on it. First of all you have these two people, Dorien Wilson, a married man, who never forgot his high school crush Peaches(Wendy Raquel Robinson)yet in this play, it's best you don't go back. For one, she's got a substance abuse problem with a drink constantly in her hand, she has a lunatic ex fiance stalking her, she has unresolved past pain that she masks with the alcohol and prescription drugs, and though Wilson was warned about this woman, he still went after her to his own detriment. Talk about the grass being greener? definitely not in this instance. I tend to agree with the folks here on this because although there was potential, even with pros here,there wasn't no hope for this. If your curious, watch it on TVOne or rent it.",1249776000,,822,4.486666666666666
2568086,5,B000FILUWE,Both Wendy and Dorien are good actors however they are both bigger than the roles they played. On a scale of one to ten I would say the play was a five.,1241827200,,152,3.78125
2568087,1,B000FILUWE,"Whoever thought this was a good movie is crazy.  The movie was horrible. I saw my girl and was like heyy. But I had to beg people to stay so we can see the end.  Not to mention when the end came it just left you hanging what was the point of the last call.  They could have left that part out.  Don't buy it, rent it, wast your time on it.",1238112000,2,339,3.6666666666666665
2568088,4,B000FILUWE,"I found the message of the play to be on point. However, some parts were too over the top, (barking man, gorrilla banana freak man) but I think that Wendy Raquel Robinson is FUNNY as ever. She is the reason that I even purchased the DVD. The price should be cheaper though. I think this is about a $7.99 to $9.99 DVD, not $13.49.",1237420800,,329,4.15625
2568089,2,B000FILUWE,I was truly disappointed by this movie(stage play). Now don't get me wrong it had it's moments and when a moment was good it was gooooooood. There are a few moments that are a touch confussing as well I thought it was just me at first but we were having movie night and everyone was asking what happened. It had a message true enough and I know you can't share an entire life story of the characters in 90 mins but at least I should care about them. I didn't truly care what happened to them.  I just wanted it to get to the end so I didn't feel like I wasted my money. Bottom line this is not one of those movies where I will be poppin' it in the DVD player when there is nothing on TV.,1234137600,,687,3.9424460431654675
2568090,5,B000FILUWE,"Looking at the cover I thought this movie was a stage play. How wrong was I. It is a documentary for singles. The women in this documentary were very real. They spoke of thoughts that you think of but you shouldn't express because you are ""christian"". This is written expressly for African American women. This would be great for single and married women ministries to use for discussion about the realities of life.",1226880000,,416,4.712328767123288
2568091,4,B000FILUWE,"No one should take either of the other two reviews presetly posted for this DVD seriously. Both betray a certain level of political correctness run amuck and failure to understand what this film is trying to achieve. Peaches is a beautifully realised character drama filled with deeply affecting performances. I'm a fairly cynical person, and fairly intolerant of film cliches...though the film vaguely covers territory a few other films touching on some of Peaches' themes cover, I didn't find it cliched or overstated, and I know many people agree with me...they just don't feel a particular need to validate their opinions through blowzy Amazon reviews.

Both other reviewers' snarky descriptions (one filled with laughable pseudoacademic jargon) of the romantic subplot in the film betray their real issue with the film, namely that they disapprove of the onscreen sexuality and of the age disparity of the characters involved. (Perhaps if George Clooney had played Alan there wouldn't have been so much whining on this general subject.) Plenty of viewers I've talked to have had no problem finding Steph's desires, or her frustration at growing up in a town with no perceived future, plausible. It's refreshing that any film these days can address this sort of sexuality without judgment or a presumption of female victimhood. Yes, the affair is doomed to fail, but one understands why these characters were drawn to one another, and what they gained from the experience. (Also, no matter how much you hate any film, posting major plot spoilers is tasteless and crass.)

Nor are are the script or performances melodramatic--in fact they're admirably restrained, and Weaving and MacKenzie do a great job of playing characters across two decades. Compared to much of what passes for character study in mainstream American films, Peaches is a revelation in its depth and lack of hand-wringing over its characters. It's not quite as astonishing as Craig Monahan's first film, The Interview, and not for all tastes, but deserves to be seen more widely than it has been, and deserves a break from the snide mischaracterizations of some reviewers who prefer opacity or imposed moral platitudes.",1197763200,18,2192,5.1892655367231635
2568092,1,B000FILUWE,"Ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems mandatory in Australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance.

That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot's overburdened with ""wow"" symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. A gross example is the giant peach float, obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory - too good to waste a free prop like that! The peach is given a cursory, unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends.

Similarly, the contrived ""black spot"" road sign where Steph's parents were killed, is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past, but her escape to what? She's had a pretty good deal where she was, especially considering her visual disability and the unending, loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.

The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama, however, goes to the characterisation of Alan. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for the wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss!

As a supervisor, Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work, implementing redundancies until, surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and Alan's left as a pathetic, unemployed failure.  No clich-free zones here, mate!  Not only this, but he also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd ever encounter.

If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, don't ask about detail.

What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg?  Why doesn't the hotel, where the couple makes love, eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and, among other pandemonium, the sheets are regularly being soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion.

Summing this movie up in one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.",1193184000,,1994,5.203125

8123289,5,B000FILUWE,"I think the fusion of reality and fantasy that this writer achieves is pure genius.  The fact that the writer basically produced the entire thing singlehandedly is amazing considering it doesn't look like it.  Often times when one person wears all of the major production hats, you get that near-sighted perspective in the production.  This goes far beyond that.  Great script.  Great actors.  Great direction.  Great emotional depth (the exchange between the two best friends about the affair was a Tony-Worthy scene and produced emotion without melodrama, which is VERY hard two do in a male-only sequence).  I absolutely loved this production as a writer and as a viewer.",1460073600,,674,5.1192660550458715

8123291,2,B000FILUWE,"Nothing to say. Sorry! Just didn't like it, I love Wendy as a actress,but not in this play. It doesn't do it for me.",1365984000,,116,3.875
8123292,3,B000FILUWE,"Well, Hugo Weaving is solid as always, and never overacts.  It's pretty obvious in places that the screenplay was written by a female.  It's too rambling, and wastes too much time on some pretty uninteresting female characters.  The brunette with the bangs is unconvincing, as is her ""affair"" with Weaving's character.

Weaving does pull the film up to three stars, with a sensitive and sympathetic portrayal of a man in the difficult position of a middle manager who was promoted from the ranks.  As someone who's been there, I can sympathize.  I figure the negative comments below reflect a kind of immature ""class bigotry"".",1360108800,,626,4.971153846153846
8123293,4,B000FILUWE,The play was very good. I love plays so I purchase them Alot I was really impressed with the quality I had never brought used before so I was Kind of nervous but I was very pleased.,1358208000,,181,3.918918918918919
8123294,4,B000FILUWE,Wendy is a fool. You will crack up and her stunts in this movie. men tend to think or act like women have majical powers and in this Play Wendy will show you just how animalistic a real crazy woman could make a weak man act. Get it its funny.,1329091200,,242,3.86

8123296,3,B000FILUWE,"When I looked at the previews, this looked like a great play. When I received the play, I watched the beginning of it and got completely thrown aback. It was not that entertaining to me. I heard more of the audience laughing far TOOOO loud to perhaps really enjoy the play. I am going to watch it again today to see if I can get to the end of it without taking it out.",1260057600,,368,3.9864864864864864
