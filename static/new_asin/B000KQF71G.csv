2697030,5,B000KQF71G,"I made sure my own windows were closed after I'd watched the first half hour, and the scariness just grew after that.  A Martinez and Richard Jordan (brilliant as usual even if he doesn't play the psychopath for once) are the detectives after the Night Stalker, and gradually even they become frightened for themselves and their families.  Skip the slasher and chainsaw murder movies - go for this one, where the detectives actually have characters and the whole thing builds and builds and scares the living daylights out of you all the way to the ending where EVERYBODY knows this killer and he can't run anymore.",1223683200,12,615,4.7924528301886795
2697031,4,B000KQF71G,"This version of the Night Stalker remains close and true to actual facts during the police investigation and capture of Richard Ramirez (aka the Night Stalker). This movie was originally made for TV so some of the violence and language are watered down, but still worth watching. If you want some more insight then you should check out the book about Richard Ramirez by Philip Carlo. There are no extras on this DVD such as commentary or interviews with the real police or Night Stalker but again still worth the watch. It is reported that Ramirez himself watched this movie from prison and was impressed with it.",1184112000,9,613,4.738317757009346
8158722,5,B000KQF71G,"This is one of my favorite movies for the cast, the acting, the presentation of those days in the 1980's when people were living in fear. It is very well done. A. Martinez has always been one of my favorite actors.

There have been other movies made about the same story but this exceeds all of them. It is a not a horor film but one done in the best of taste.

If you like suspense, and action then you will enjoy this.",1522281600,,420,4.048192771084337
8158723,5,B000KQF71G,"I have always wondered why Richard Ramirez was not dubbed""The Night Prowler"" just like the title of the old AC/DC tune. Stalkers tend to case their potential victims. Where as a Prowler just chooses a residence totally at random, not really caring who is inside and who his potential victim(s) of that particular evening are going to be. The movie had very decent acting, a very close to real life plot, and was in my opinion very well done. The actor who played Ramirez really shined at the end when in the interrogation room. He also played a hit man in 'Scarface' and the hospital janitor in the movie 'Cobra'. I thought he was chillingly convincing. The DVD was well worth the money.",1467590400,,687,4.59349593495935
8158724,5,B000KQF71G,"I already owned the vhs tape, but was glad to see that they finally came out with it on dvd. It's pretty close to what happened to Ramirez. The actors did a good job. I really liked the movie.",1458691200,2,192,3.948717948717949

8158726,1,B000KQF71G,"I am from Greater London, in the U.K. and find the Night Stalker case to be the most frightening.
There are TV true crime movies that can be intriguing like Ted Bundy, the Deliberate Stranger, or John Wayne Gacy, to catch a Killer.
However, I once owned this TV movie of Manhunt: search for the Night Stalker and it is very dull, it is trying too hard to be a ""Chiller-Thriller"" and trying its best to exude feeling of suspense, but it fails to do that because of hammy performances and lack of reality in the script.
The black-clad Killer in the movie made so much noise, and used too much flashlights in the dark, you would think people would wake up when he enters in their residence, when in real life, the Killer is suppose to be militant and work in darkness, hence the moniker; ""Night Stalker"".
The script was terribly careless, for example, one of Gil Carrillo's Daughters was called Rene, but 43 minutes into the movie, Gil's Wife, Pearl called the same girl ""Mica""- this erratum could have been corrected. The worst part is the rest of the dialogue, which is not convincing to match the real life characters, their personal experiences and personality backgrounds from this movie, it fails to represent their personalities altogether.
Richard Jordan, who plays a ""seasoned"" Detective, Frank Salerno always ""feels things"" in this case, he tells Sheriff Grimm as he proves one Serial Killer is operating the crimes ""This is one Guy doing this - I can feel it"" and to his Partner, Gil, ""I have a funny feeling about tonight - he is going out again"" and when they pursue Ramirez prior to ID him in the Newspapers, Jordan says "" I can feel it Gill it is all over"".
Also Frank goes on about how ""great"" things are, there is a scene Gill solemnly says ""oh no! He switched guns on us! He used a .25 instead of a .22"" Salerno replies ""that's Great, Phil (the Forensic Scientist) can give us a positive make on the 25, if we get him with this Gun, he is nailed!"" and another ridiculous scene is when a cop goes ""Hey Frank, we found the shoe, it is a special shoe made by Avia and there are thirteen thousand and fifty-six distributed"", and Salerno's response is ""that is Great Washington!! It is going to be that much easier for you to trace every bit of sale today"" and Washington laughs ""How do I know you are going to say that!!"" - this was suppose to be an amusing line, but there is no ring of truth to it. Why did Washington NOT mention there is ONLY one pair of avia 440 modal that is size 11 and a half twelve, which is the same one at the scenes from the series of murders and just 'one' man is wearing this 'rare' shoe?
The Movie Writers did miss out conspicuous details of not illustrating Diane Feinstein's elocution slip up of mentioning the rare Avia shoes of a ""particular size"" that made the Killer change his footwear. So there was loose research to these ""true-crime"" accounts of what actually happened, and lack of realism in the script.
The writers probably never put their heads together to think about the ""real"" lives of these Detectives, because when Richard was caught and put into custody, Jordan turns to Gill and says ""we will be living with this for a long time!"" For an experienced Detective who also worked on the Hillside Strangler case, mentions an unrealistic line - I am sure other Viewers will find this line quite false.
All the Actors were given unrealistic lines, the acting was bad too. The visage of the killer was dramatically revealed near the end. Richard Ramirez should be portrayed by a talented actor, but NOT Gregory Norman Cruz, he was equally bad, and does not resemble Ramirez! Greg had a single bug-eyed sneer, distinctly wicked expression, The Real Richard was Handsome as a Movie Star, possessing a dangerously seductive streak and the combination of looking Angelic with a mysterious air- Guys and Girls flock to him. It was too politically correct for my taste.
It is a predictable movie with bad enactment, terrible humour, and bad music score with a song that is a rip off of Night Prowler by AC/DC, Bruce Seth Green should instead produce the feel of Los Angeles in 1985, like show statistics of Guns and burglar alarms sold by the hour, or vast amount of people being alarmed when staying up at night and being jumpy to every a nuance of sound thinking the Stalker is there, because the minds plays tricks on the people, and the brutal heat did not help much that summer; the paranoia was insurmountable, the scary aura of the city at that time was absent in this film, it is not a convincing thriller.
Anyway! I read Philip Carlo's book and that is miles better, and showed the truth about real-life events and situations. Read the book instead.",1422748800,,4706,4.544169611307421

8158728,4,B000KQF71G,"Lived in L.A. back then. Most people weren't that afraid, but we heard the ""bumps in the night"" more often! Saw this on TV years ago and I still like it. Acting is a bit predictable but it's still an interesting piece of history.",1397952000,3,229,4.2272727272727275
8158729,3,B000KQF71G,"At one point in this film, a television executive -- he was a male of course, since the film was set in the 80s -- puts his arm around a female reporter who works at the station, just before he walks her out to her car.  She didn't feel comfortable being out in the parking lot by herself, but could you blame her?  It was the mid-80s, and Richard Ramirez was still on the loose.  But did she really think that some male executive could really protect her against a monster such as Mr. Ramirez?  Probably not.

But she might have sued the male executive for sexual harassment, although that kind of craziness didn't really start happening until around 1990.  So while she wasn't safe having an escort, that male executive was probably safe at that time from a sexual harassment lawsuit.  Ah, how times have changed.  We are probably safer today since there are fewer people around who are as horrible as Mr. Ramirez was, but we're surely less protected from frivolous lawsuits.

I just read the book ""Night Stalker"" by Philip Carlo -- a fairly riveting read although I ""only"" gave it a 4 on this site and wrote a review, saying why -- so I just had to see this film.  After all, Mr. Ramirez actually watched this film himself with the detectives portrayed in this film who were chasing him, inside the county jail.  Those detectives were nice enough to record the TV show on VHS tape and take that tape to the jail with them so that Mr. Ramirez could view an encore presentation; they even brought him popcorn.  (Mr. Ramirez, while he had TV privileges in prison, was not allowed to watch the first showing of ""Manhunt"" for punishment due to bad court behavior.  It's one thing to kill people, but swear at a judge?  Tsk tsk.)

Yes, I will admit that this review is somewhat snarky, but I had to pay $35 bones to purchase it, and it was a used DVD.  Plus, it was originally filmed in 480i, cropped, and not in HD, but luckily for me, I watched it in upconverted 1080P, which was still pretty poor, to tell you the truth.  But what can you expect?  Back then, no one had cell phones -- watch people running into homes to call the cops towards the end -- no one had HD at that time, and evidently, most people had VHS.  Ah, happier times. . . .

I thought that the man who plays Mr. Ramirez here didn't exactly work for me.  Mr. Ramirez was pretty tall in real life, and while I usually don't care if an actor looks like who he is playing, in this case height did matter.  After all, that was a great part of what made people scared of Mr. Ramirez.  Sure, the actor had bad teeth -- probably not his own would be my guess, probably prosthetics -- but that wasn't enough to make him seem real or really scary to me.  The detectives weren't bad here, especially the Hispanic partner (I'm still trying to determine his name).

I watched the film ""Night Stalker"" a while back, and for me, it was pretty much a misfire.  So, I decided that I wanted to see if I could find a good movie about Mr. Ramirez.  Well, I guess that I will have to keep searching.  Hollywood, Mr. Ramirez was nice enough to get cancer and die, which was a lot nicer than the state of California was for letting him live about 30 years too long.  So, why not make a good movie about him now, especially since you won't have to cough up any royalties about his life?",1379635200,,3331,4.301765650080257
