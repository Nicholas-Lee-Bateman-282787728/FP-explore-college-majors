7202652,5,B00XX3VR0S,Great Movie!! Follows historical fact very well ..only complaint is the actors sometimes look way to picture perfect for the dirty frontier otherwise  a great film,1436227200,3,163,5.269230769230769
7202653,5,B00XX3VR0S,"Very good movie, tho difficult to watch the fighting scenes; and sad to see how the Tribes were driven off of their land.",1436227200,2,121,4.304347826086956

7202658,5,B00XX3VR0S,"Excellent film. Such brave children /teenagers. I'm very sorry it was/is a true ""story"". Beautiful music. Thank you for making it available. I have nothing negative to say about this. I rented it, but now that I've seen it, I'm going to buy it.",1524873600,,244,4.568181818181818
7202659,2,B00XX3VR0S,"I was really looking forward to viewing, Alone Yet Not Alone. I don't like to criticize small indy films done on a low budget, because I know that a lot of work goes into them. At the same time, I must be honest about my personal feelings of a movie, and I was highly disappointed. The character development, the story, and the acting was quite below average performance. When I find myself wishing a film was over, I don't consider it time and money well spent. The characters did not interest me, and the story came across more like a documentary, than the epic tale it could have been.

Having said that, I really really enjoyed the musical score by Joni Eareckson Tada. As a matter of fact, I actually included it in my kids bedtime music playlist. I remember the complaints about the song not being awarded when the movie was released. A lot of people were crying wolf, and although the song is absolutely beautiful, the movie was not. This was probably the reason why it did not get the award.",1524873600,,999,4.459016393442623
7202660,5,B00XX3VR0S,Great Movie!!!  Watched it several times and love the theme song...have sung it in church,1523836800,,89,4.933333333333334

7202664,5,B00XX3VR0S,"Watch/Listen to this movie all the way to the end through the credits, when this wonderful invalid lady on a wheel chair sings the theme song about the Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. She sings ""Alone Yet Not Alone"".  Wonderful Song!. This Song WON an academy Award which was taken back.  My guess because of liberals who didn't like it because it was (1) about Jesus, and (2) made the Delaware Indians look bad. This movie is a true story about how in the 1700's the Delaware Indians joined up with the French, in the French & Indian War. These Indians went on a rampage in the Pennsylvania frontier - murdering, killing, and kidnapping women and children American settlers.  Is this why this Academy award for bed song was taken back? The truth?",1521936000,,750,4.582089552238806
7202665,4,B00XX3VR0S,This is a wonderful movie based on a true story. I learned some things about our American history that I did not know. Not recommeded for young children because of some intense violence. The theme of the movie is God's never failing love for us even in the worst of circumstanes.,1521676800,,279,4.490196078431373
7202666,1,B00XX3VR0S,Boring.  Terrible acting and boring story.  Turned it off after 10 minutes,1520640000,,74,5.083333333333333

7202671,5,B00XX3VR0S,What a great story.  The only thing unreal is the main actress looked too much like she was a model and not to get dirty.  The singing was awesome and Joni Erikson Tada should have won an award for her song.,1517270400,,207,4.024390243902439
7202672,4,B00XX3VR0S,I enjoyed this movie but thought the make up and such was a little over the top.  The Indians wanted to make her look like an Indian after they  kidnapped her and I didn't like the look.  The story line was interesting enough though to hold my interest.,1517184000,,253,4.229166666666667

7202689,5,B00XX3VR0S,"I really enjoyed this movie, & have watched it more than once. The visual aspects in this movie were beautiful .... the acting, as far as I am concerned, was good .... the story-line was based a true story, & I felt it gave the correct balance of the mistrust, the hatred, with touches of love. I am not religious, but the religious element had to be in the movie, as German immigrants were often escaping persecution for their ""heretic"" faith, so to remove that element from the movie, would make the story different from the True story of the two German sisters taken captive & raised as Native Americans, along with many other children. I am happy to recommend this film, but if you christian religion offends you, then this is probably not the film for you. By the way ...... I loved the music & the song, which stuck in my head for days, & I would find myself singing it.",1497916800,,876,4.380368098159509
7202690,5,B00XX3VR0S,Great movie for the family. Filled with good decent human values and performed by very good actors!,1496880000,,99,4.882352941176471
7202691,5,B00XX3VR0S,This was hard to watch only because we now live such a sheltered and comfortable life.  It is amazing that these children were able to survive and that some were able to escape and return to their families.  The Native People were really portrayed quite fairly.  Some were mean and some were not.  The arrogance of the British commander and stubbornness of the Quakers initially was what caused the whole problem to begin with.  The bad reviews are likely from people who had formed an opinion before even watching the film.,1496448000,2,524,4.714285714285714

7202697,4,B00XX3VR0S,A fairly well documented account of a real event. But Hollywood has its artistic license to take liberties with the facts.  Worth viewing to learn the historical story.,1492560000,,168,5.0

7202770,5,B00XX3VR0S,Ok...I get it. Some of you found this movie just so so. Well to me it was beautifully made despite the negatives you pointed out. Honestly to find a movie that was both true and without Hollywood's cursing and sex was refreshing! Joni Earickson Tada's song was so touching. We need more movies like this and people try to look at the positive side rather than bad wigs and Indians talking more English sounding. So what!!!! It is a movie that families can watch together and discuss the reality of history in America! I watched it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it faults and all!,1482105600,9,578,4.5673076923076925

7202805,1,B00XX3VR0S,"This movie seemed to be made by and for simpletons.  My wife and I could only tolerate about 20 minutes of the horribly shallow characters and insulting, elementary-school dialog.  It was all way too amateurish - more like a 6th grade school play than a production by professional anythings.  What ""story"" the movie had to tell was totally lost once one's eyes glazed over and the brain slipped into hibernation mode.  Even if you're desperate for something - anything - to fill in for an hour of entertainment, whatever else is available simply must be a better choice.
Before I selected this film to watch, I was impressed by the numerous favorable reviews written by Amazon readers.  How anyone could sit through even 20 minutes of this film and develop an honestly favorable opinion is beyond my understanding.",1481587200,,814,4.869565217391305

As I got older, I was able to appreciate the book. When I saw the movie title I decided I needed to watch it. It was surprisingly good! The acting of course could be better, some parts were a little awkward in transition, but it carries a great message and is a wonderful family movie.

The acting was atrocious - specifically, their speech was so slow that it was unnatural and the actor's movements were awkward; 4.

Felt like a high school musical, and I kept expecting someone to burst into song. Poorly written. Bad acting. Bad costumes. Bad sets. This movie doesn't cut it if you're up for realism, but I imagine it might make for decent family viewing. In all fairness, I couldn't get past the first five minutes.

7203010,2,B00XX3VR0S,"This feels like a 1980s TV movie or a movie run at Christian camp. Something is very wrong with how people rate movies on Amazon Prime. I guess they are movie newbies and have not watched hundreds of good quality pictures, and do not have the ability to judge or compare works of art, and just care if they ""like"" something. By all objective measures, this movie is jarringly low budget, with simplistic acting and direction, a poor script, and questionable historical facts.

Then we have the themes: if you do not know history, unfortunately, you will believe all Native Americans were like ISIS. And of course, this is a pro-Lutheran/Christian propaganda piece, where Western culture (as represented by the colonies and British) is supposed to be more civilized than the evil French and heathen Native savages.

All that said, my spouse cried at the end, and was into the movie, even with all of these flaws. So to each your own! The theme song is great. For Christians only.",1478908800,5,978,4.747058823529412

This movie was like a summer camp play with beautiful scenery.  The dialog was absurd and insulting. The natives growled their lines. The women chirped them. As one woman is burning alive she sweetly forgives her captors in a quiet voice.  I'm not saying she didn't forgive, but she probably would have forgiven very, very loudly! She would have been screaming forgiveness I would think. Then years later the heroine grows up and she is wearing a wig and heavy handed drug store makeup.  Just silly.  I realized right away that this film was pushing a Christian agenda, but hoped that the story would be cast in an unbiased historical manner. It particularly sticks in my craw that in the beginning of the film the family was thrilled to be in America where there was religious freedom for everyone. Everyone except for the people who were there first.  Anyway, I could not finish it. Ill go read about Susquehanna to see how it ends.",1478304000,6,1061,4.563157894736842

It is told, however, and you can see the effects it has on the two girls who are captured as slaves for the indians.

There is so much happening in so many ways: Drama, adventure, suspense, dignity, outrage, hostility, love, and numbness from grief and yet great joy from impossible turns of events. Not every one will like this story...but very many will be inspired.

7203225,2,B00XX3VR0S,"A just okay supposedly true-life story with a less than true-to-life ending. Not really much in this tale that shows how the protagonist's faith in Jesus Christ got her through her trials. The truth is, many if not most, white children captured by American Indians that survived the ordeal assimilated into their respective tribes and did not want to go back to so-called white civilization (Read the story of Cynthia Ann Parker for one). Also, the story of life for a female within an American Indian tribe is also highly romanticized. Women within tribes lived brutal existences, even if they were native to the tribe, where they did nearly all of the arduous work and the men primarily hunted and made war. Even the settler's lives themselves were highly romanticized by portraying life as relatively easy when the opposite was true. This movie is filled with cliches from much better films and borrows heavily from the 1992 feature, The Last of the Mohicans, with Daniel Day-Lewis. Also downright laughable was the Indians dying the hair of the main white captive and putting tanning cream on her skin to make her look more native AmericanDidn't show what brands the Indians used. There also seemed to be plenty of eye make-up around for when the white females grew up so they always looked gorgeous. Overall this is a very amateurish and trite, untrue-to-life tale. This is particularly disappointing since Christians having been making better ""faith-based"" films of late such as, 'God's Not Dead' and ""War Room.' This is definitely a rental and not something I would want to own. I viewed it from a copy from the library.",1473292800,,1627,4.898550724637682

7203250,3,B00XX3VR0S,"Starting in 1775 we have a story of a German family who emigrated to America to avoid religious persecution. They buy their own land in an area that was previously the domain of the local Native Indian Tribe. The British are at war with the French  again  and both sides drag the local populace into the conflict and the local tribes also.

This results in a previously allied tribe raiding the frontier homesteads and killing, burning and taking prisoners. This includes Barbara Leininger and her sister. What follows is what befalls them and their friends.

Now I love a good frontier tale, the Native Americans are really done well and some of the locations are excellent  I think they used the same area as Michael Mann in The Last of the Mohicans so very evocative. The acting ranges from good to am dram and that is a shame. Some of the characters are stereo typed to the point of incredulity  especially a couple of the English officers. Then there are the wigs which started of being funny and then became annoying. I have seen more realistic toupees on sale in a joke shop. Why ruin a film that had a fair amount of money spent on it with minor hic cups? If you like a frontier story with a  bit of action and some great fancy dress then there may be a great film here for you, if you like true quality in your films then think twice.",1467158400,,1343,4.391129032258065

However in addition I really liked how scripture was brought in and a person's faith in Christ is applied to get through tough situations.  This period of history was really hard for the settlers and for the ones who been living here prior to the settlers coming and invading their land.

I believe the movie did a good job of balancing good and evil.  It showed that there were good, compassionate people within the Delaware Indian tribe as well as on the British side.  It also showed that evil exists in every ethnic group of people.  Each side had their reasons for doing what they did.  Another reason I liked the movie is because it moved me to think deeply about the fact that we are truly never alone (Theme: God is always with us), I think it scored!  I highly recommend this film based on the true life experience of a frightened little girl during the early years of our American history and how her faith carried her through a horrendous experience.

7203365,4,B00XX3VR0S,"I really don't see why all the detractors feel justified in maligning this film. The visual aspect is, well, stunning! The music is not distracting and the melodies set the mood. The story is closely based on history. Some of Native Americans were for England, some were for France. The war was harsh, people were brutally murdered. Many children were indeed kidnapped by warring tribes. The plot focuses on a group of children who struggled to make it home to their families. History cannot be white-washed! These immigrants from Germany on which the film is based, were a people of faith and to leave this fact out of the story would be censorship at its worst. I found the plot to be fast paced and intriguing. I am not taking sides for one race or another. One of my ancestors was scalped by Indians and a couple generations later, his descendants married Cherokees, so I am mixed blood and proud of it. What I most want to say is political correctness and atheism have no place in historically based films. Just sit back and learn something from these movies.",1449014400,24,1064,4.634920634920635

On the other hand, it covers a period in our history that was formative for the nation-to-be and it does as fairly as possible. The Indians, in particular, are neither villains nor totally righteous. They are portrayed as people. Same with the settlers.

My three kids loved it, it got them to asking lots of questions, and that says a lot for any movie.

How wonderful is that!  And it also shows that when we truly belong to the Lord we will not make the wrong choice.

7203411,5,B00XX3VR0S,"This movie is based on the true story of Barbara and Regina Leininger. There is also an excellent book by the same title written by Tracy Leininger Craven. Barbara and Regina, 12 and 9, lived on the Pennsylvania frontier during the French and Indian War. They were taken captive during an Indian raid in which their father and oldest brother were killed. Their mother and other brother were away at the time. Barbara and Regina were separated and taken to different Indian villages. This movie focuses on Barbara's journey and covers a span of 9 years.

It came to our attention because a Native American from our area actually got the chance to play an extra in the movie.  The power of prayer is very evident throughout the movie.  Their belief in God saw these girls through a terrible period in their lives.",1443312000,,400,4.351351351351352

7203443,5,B00XX3VR0S,This movie was very well done and the soundtrack is excellent.  Great historically accurate depictions of colonial life on the frontier.  No inappropriate scenes or language.  There are some very intense scenes which may be too much for younger or more sensitive children.  It is a great opportunity to share with your children the reality of evil in the world and how a vengeful spirit destroys all in its path including self.  There is also the great lesson of trusting in Jesus Christ no matter what men may do to the body.  Excellent movie!,1442448000,,544,4.73404255319149

7203445,5,B00XX3VR0S,It didn't take long to understand the reason for the title.  This sweet song will remain in my heart as a reminder that I am never truly alone.  I appreciate that it was based on true accounts.  It was well written and directed.  I felt sympathy for both sides and understood the pain both sides felt as they made their way through that difficult period of colonization.  It brought me to tears several times and not once did I have to concern myself with inappropriate language or immoral acts.

I felt that it was powerful and it gave us a glance into some of the history of the time 1750's-1760's.

It was beautifully depicted and historically told with a musical score based on the beautiful and moving song sung by Joni Eareckson of the same title as the movie.

7203468,4,B00XX3VR0S,"We had been waiting to see this since it had made an appearance in limited movie theaters and none were around our area.  We enjoyed the theme song and it was beautifully sang.  This was a good family movie and had a lot of good moral lessons to discuss with older children.  If you have younger children, I would caution whether you would want them to watch.  There are some emotionally scary parts for younger children as the Indians are raiding, killing and scalping families and capturing the kids and women.  We see the kids being marched off without their parents which could be terrifying for younger children.  For older children, though, it is a good discussion to have and how they would respond in a similar situation.",1441238400,,729,4.65625

I'm the type that would rather enjoy a low budget clean movie with a good story instead of a blockbuster film filled with vulgarity and innuendos. I only wish it was on bIu-ray instead of DVD. I also LOVE the theme song (which bears the same title of the movie) performed by Joni Tada.,1441065600,9,348,4.3538461538461535

The movie did not have a wide theatrical release so I did not expect a lot from the production.  The acting and production quality was much better than I expected for an independent release without a sizeable budget.

7203488,4,B00XX3VR0S,"Above average movie for a relatively low budget film.  Overall it is quite scenic and often feels ""bigger"" than one might expect.  It seems to have wanted, and gotten in some circles, a reputation for being ""religious;"" I'm happy to say it's undeserving in that regard as Alone Yet Not Alone simply doesn't IGNORE that America's founding generations, including Native Americans, had God or gods in their lives.  Heaven forbid!  LOL  Religiosity, thank goodness, is arguably downplayed in this historically-based period piece by any stretch of the rational imagination.  It is family friendly but this is not a theme for sensitive children in my opinion.  This might have done better in the box office just being entitled ""Taken"" but I think that was already in use...  Granted, this won't be anyone's favorite film of all time but it also won't disappoint anyone (who doesn't choose to be offended by who knows what).

It was hard to connect with the characters.  The  woman who grew up with the Indians after being captured as a young girl, looked like she stepped off the pages of Vogue magazine. The only thing that looked like she had lived  off the land in a hut was the feather stuck strategically in her black- dyed hair. The Indians were pretty realistic looking, but I thought  the 'me tarzan, you jane' type of dialogue was amateurish.. I suppose young children might enjoy this for a family movie . I also wonder about the lack of political correctness in the movie, even though I don't usually stoop  to that level of criticism . Its just that the Indians were depicted as soooooo mean and animalistic for the most part. I've been programmed by the media to squirm when I see things like that I guess.",1439596800,7,967,4.454545454545454

7203529,5,B00XX3VR0S,"I enjoyed this story of faith and determination in the face of war's brutality. Set during the French and Indian War, it relates a German immigrant family's experience coming to the colony of Pennsylvania and settling on the frontier. I appreciated the historical accuracy of the film and the period costuming. The Leininger family, the focus of the movie, comes across as genuine and loving. While not appropriate for young children, it is a good movie for adults and teens, especially those who believe in the important role of God in family life.",1439424000,5,549,4.913978494623656

Her make up was way to perfect, she had very white and straight teeth and she wore buckskin pants which a woman of an Indian tribe wouldn't do.  She was way to clean for her roll as a white captive of the period.  She just didn't look believable and didn't fit the roll she was playing.  I would have only given it 2 1/2 stars, but that wasn't an option.  Also the movie wasn't really that good to be delayed in being released.",1439337600,,556,4.19811320754717

7203546,5,B00XX3VR0S,"Many may have seen this when in the theatres. I am sorry to say I didnt, but now that I watched it via DVD I am astounded. The timeframe is during the French and Indian War when people were living on land far from anyone. Daily living was hard enough, but then when taken captive to remember Gods faithfulness through all sorts of trials was really inspiring!
After the movie, the full song that plays in the background at different times in the movie is sung in its entirety at the end. Joni Erikson Tada is the one who sang and it is a beautiful song of worship sung by a woman who can attest to the truths spoken. As I watched the story, I couldn't imagine being an immigrant, settling in a new land and having part of my family torn away from me in such a manner. All throughout the movie as characters lived through the trials, tears and loss what a testimony to the enduring faith of believers in the 1700s.
Watch the movie all the way through to see what enduring faith lives on long after the real people died. I hope you are as inspired to be bold, to be unashamed and to cling to God no matter what life experiences you live in or through. It simply blew me away to see what lives on a lot longer than any of the people from the past.
May I be like those who have come before me who left a testimony that points future generations to the One and Only God!",1438905600,3,1365,4.135338345864661

This movie is definitely worth the watch.. In fact, first my wife and I watched, and then the next day we watched it with the children. 100% kid safe movie in my opinion.. You still have fighting and killing but no blood and guts in your face. The way I see it, those poor kids in the movie lived through it, then my kids can watch it and just maybe learn a little more to appreciate how good they have it.

I would only complain about one aspect of the filming, the ending felt rushed and the spinning effect to see all characters reaction was a bit dizzying.  The other complaint I have is the lack of good public relations and response to people wondering about what theaters it might be in and when it might be released.  I heard an interview about the film on the radio just as the movie was released and found out that it wasn't being shown in my state.  And after that no word from anyone in response to Facebook and Twitter questions about a release date.  I had to find that out from imdb.com and a Christian movie website, with the release date pushed back multiple times.  I rented the film on Amazon the day it was released.  I have an ancestor that went through something similar during the French and Indian War and truly wanted to see how they portrayed being captured by Native Americans.

7203573,3,B00XX3VR0S,"I recently watched another Christian Film that was a period piece called (The Over-Mountain Men: Rise of the Regulators) by Shiloh Films, it was Realistic, Historically accurate and Exciting to boot!!! I was hoping to get the same from this film but it fell just short of my previous expectations.

This Film was good but had a few Ridiculous issues that I couldn't get past.
I will name 2 for now.

#1 (LAZY FILM MAKING) The British were feared by the Natives and for very good reason. They were soldiers, trained to work well as a unit. This film made them look like drunken fools waiting to be killed off so the indians could look better. What the Director missed was that IF the Redcoats would have been more realistic then the Indians would have looked that much more Dangerous after killing them.

#1 (UNREALISTIC CHARACTER) The Girl in the leading roll had grown up living with Natives, but she looked more like a modern day Fashionista dressed as an Indian at a Halloween Party. With clean face, perfect white teeth and freshly plucked eyebrows she looked ready for a runway and not period piece film. This sort of thing pulls viewers out of the Idea that this is set back in a day were Salon's didn't exist.

I give it 3 stars because it was well done. Good Cinematography, good story and great Music!!!
I would recommend maybe renting it or waiting until this film comes down in price.
I suggest saving your pennies for Shiloh Films (The Over-Mountain Men:The Price of Freedom), it will be on DVD next June!
Hope this helps!",1437523200,12,1534,4.587591240875913

It is a great story that wanted to be told, but the acting was so bad, and the costuming, which included bad black wigs, were bad.  The native American actor's dialog was so predictable, it fell flat for me.  Then there was the heavy eye makeup on Barbara.  After she returned, her hair and makeup was very glamorized.

In a daring escape, (punishable by burning at the stake if caught) Barbara and Marie with two other captives traversed hundred of miles of hostile territory seeking freedom.  The story is a rare glimpse into the suffering and sacrifices of so many Scottish, German and English families living along the Pennsylvania and Virginia frontiers in 1755.

Benjamin, unfortunately, missed the real point of the story and seemed to focus on immature expectations.  I'm glad he envisions himself as a ""visionary"" because he must be the only one who holds himself in such high regard.  This is a superb story of love and faith triumphing over evil and misfortune.  Given the fact that movies like this don't have the mega financial backing of big studio productions, I must say the makers of this film did a superb job.  I am ordering several copies for family members and friends.  But this movie today for your family and you won't go wrong.",1436659200,45,678,4.6

8717008,5,B00XX3VR0S,"Great and inspirational story.  It is a faith-based film, but not a preachy one.  The storyline is true and touching.  Don't expect Hollywood production values that you would find in a secular film costing a hundred million.  But do expect a true story that is heartwarming and clean-cut.  There is violence (but not gratuitous violence), so the film would probably be too intense for children under 13.  No foul language whatsoever.",1535068800,,433,5.028169014084507
