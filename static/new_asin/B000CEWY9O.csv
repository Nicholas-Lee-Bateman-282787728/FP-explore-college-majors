4862305,3,B000CEWY9O,"Wilson (Woody Harrelson) is a neurotic loner who has a dog for company. He has a habit of talking to strangers that don't want to be bothered. When his father passes away, Wilson tries to connect to his past, including his crack smoking street prostitute ex-wife played by Laura Dern with stringy hair. She gives him information that gives Wilson hope for the future...a quest.

Wilson was a guy you could pity and laugh at with his neurotic tendencies, making the film a comedy which suddenly turns into violence in a few scenes, changing the tone of the film for a moment. We really know very little about Wilson, like his former occupation. He does stuff that is wrong, but doesn't realize how frequently he crosses lines. He lives a life of loneliness with fleeting moments of happiness. The film had its ups and downs and didn't work when it attempted to be a drama.

4862311,4,B000CEWY9O,This movie deserves a better rating than it has received. I think it's mostly because people don't know what to expect of it. It's not the kind of performance you normally see from Woody and I like that. But plenty of other people will be disappointed. It's a quirky dramedy. If you can laugh at the strange turns life can take then you'll probably enjoy this movie. If not then go away you're not welcome here.,1513296000,2,411,4.421052631578948

This movie was just okay...it was a bit predictable, with too much sadness (read: real life) for my taste in a comedy - so classifying this either way would be very difficult. If you don't like cuss words - this move is not for you. The language was just part of the characters portrayed, so not really for impact. Watching it once was enough forever.

4862343,5,B000CEWY9O,Woody Harrelson is great in this movie about a quirky kind of man and his way of dealing with his life. I would watch this again and that is a statement that I hardly ever make.,1503446400,,177,3.9444444444444446

4862345,5,B000CEWY9O,"I will agree with some of the other negative reviews that the movie preview did not give justice to what the story is.  I was drawn to it because the preview shows a man who has very little filter between the brain and mouth and a lot of time says things which comes to mind and that would lead one to believe that this is a comedy.  There are some funny parts, although, the story goes deeper than that.  I can certainly understand why it would not appeal to a younger crowd.  It was appealing to me because I feel that the story is relative to my own life of going through a divorce and not having full custody of my own children with current feelings of sorrow of not having been a full time, better father.  Wilson has depression and also feels loss of not having been a full time father to his daughter.  Many may relate to this story and I feel that those who may appreciate it  the most may be an older crowd of whom has been through some of the hurdles of life with depression and regrets of past decisions.  All in all, the story was touching and I almost cried at the end.  I would say this may fall under the genre of tragic comedy.",1502841600,3,1143,4.135746606334842

4862347,2,B000CEWY9O,"I am not sure whether to call this movie a comedy or a drama as it really cant seem to make up its mind what it wants to be.  The trailer makes this look like it is a comedy but if you have watched the trailer, that is really the only comedic moments in the movie as the rest is mostly a sad, depressing mess.

Woody Harrelson is ok as the quirky, weird character but the inconsistent, uneven script doesnt make him relatable or even likeable.  There is very little development of his character who suddenly becomes someone different after finding the lost daughter.  The storyline, like the character, really made no sense at times.

The few light moments there are in the movie are consistently ran over by the heavy, depressing feel of the rest of the movie.  The story is inconsistent and seems to get lost at times in what point it is trying to make with an ending that feels a little sappy and totally inconsistent with the rest of the movie.

The movie as a whole was pretty boring and dull with such an uneven script it was pretty disappointing to watch.

4862350,2,B000CEWY9O,"The annoying main character was not believable. Nor was it believable that two attractive women would find him attractive enough to sleep with him. Seemed retarded, not just socially awkward. So this movie is about a mentally deficient guy with no filter who occasionally says some serious things that seem profound in contrast with everything else he says. I probably say two or three  more profound things every day before I even eat breakfast. Difference is I continue to say intelligent things the rest of the day and no-one thinks twice about it. I mean, I'm not even that smart. After all, I paid for this movie thinking it was going to be an interesting character study. And I watched the whole movie. Didn't think the movie was good. Or maybe it was a great movie, right in front of me and I just couldn't see it. Oops, there I go again saying profound things ...

4862353,5,B000CEWY9O,"We decided to watch this movie on a whim.  We had never heard of it before, but we love independent films and Woody Harrelson is always good.  The story line is about a man (Wilson) who lives an odd life, mostly on his own.  He learns that a long-time girlfriend from many years ago, gave birth to a baby and gave her up for adoption.  What follows is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking search (with his ex) for the daughter they gave up.  The character, Wilson, is a very strange guy with a huge heart.

Taking David Clowses graphic novel character  a chatty grouch with a penchant for striking up inconvenient conversations  and putting him on film, with Woody Harrelson in the starring role.

What did I think?

If you saw the trailer for this, you might well have laughed out loud and you might well feel compelled to pay and see it. Dont. All the good bits are in the trailer. The storyline is aimless, the script dull, and any endearing qualities difficult to locate; leaving Harrelsons sweet smile & Laura Dern and Isabella Amaras good turns stranded on an island of meaninglessness. Its mercifully short, but you cant help feeling a gung-ho editor may have left just a few too many scenes on the cutting room floor, leaving a comedy with insufficient laughs, and a talented cast with little to work with.",1495756800,6,824,4.774647887323944

This movie was also filmed in my home state, and I was also an extra in this movie.  Got to see Woody Harrelson in person during the filming of the scene where I had been an extra.  Was hoping that I would have been in the movie.  The scenes that I had been in during the filming were not in the final production.  So that is my only disappointment.

I really did not know what to expect about this movie.  Was thrilled to see many of the people that I had seen during the filming, that actually made it into the final piece. It was great to watch and try to figure out where the various scenes were shot.

While watching the movie, thought it would go in one direction when it turned down a completely different direction than anticipated.

Was thinking that it would be a darker comedy.  Was thrilled that it turned out to be a lot lighter than expected.

Don't want to give it away.  Have an even deeper respect for Woody Harrelson as an actor.  He sure has come a long way from when we first saw him on Cheers!  Love this Guy, and his great diversity of talents!

This has parts where you laugh, cry, hold your breathe, and are surprised.  Highly recommend watching!  It is a good movie for teenagers of all ages.  Little ones might not be so interested.",1517875200,,1321,4.254032258064516
