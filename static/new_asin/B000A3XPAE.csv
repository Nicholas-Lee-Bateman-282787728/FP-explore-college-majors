2358700,5,B000A3XPAE,"What is so good about abortion? If they say ""it is OK"" to do it, why then, you cannot speak about what happened after?
I LIVED IN SHAME, REGRET, UNFORGIVENESS AND GUILT FOR SO MANY YEARS! I finally heard about the One who has the POWER to RESTORE my life to the fullest through this ""Tilly""-Video and I can assure you that my life has never been the same again! And even more... every women/men I have recomended it has experienced the same HEALING, RESTORATION, PEACE AND NEW LIFE WHEN DOING WHAT IT IS SO CLEARLY SPOKEN IN IT...
Who says there is no help for the wounded? I am a living proof of God's Extravagant Love!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tilly/dp/B000E1EPMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tilly</a>",1250640000,12,752,5.275

8074345,5,B000A3XPAE,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I would recommend every teenager to see this video. I sent it to a friend of mine's daughter in NYC.  She had her opinions on life and I asked her to please watch this, if for no other reason than to humor me.  She agreed then wrote me back after she watched it and said it changed her life.  She will never think like she did about an unborn child.  She was very moved by it and had her sister watch it too.",1422230400,2,444,3.8461538461538463
8074346,5,B000A3XPAE,"Any movie the promotes pro-life I'm all for. This movie while quite expensive is very well written and directed/produced. Well worth the cost. On a lighter note don't buy it right off. It was $85.00 when I added it to my save for later and came down to $24.95, and I had not the money at the time, and it raised to $33.00 before I had the funds to buy it. Well worth the waitl.",1411948800,,377,4.04
