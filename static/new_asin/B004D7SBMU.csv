4331570,5,B004D7SBMU,I was hoping this would be a basic explanation of how the brain works.  The video explains various individual kinds of mental events -- such as how we are fooled by magicians -- in an interesting way.,1381536000,5,200,4.405405405405405
4331571,5,B004D7SBMU,I enjoy the Nova educational movies. Very informative and well worth the time to watch. I certainly recommend this one!,1367020800,6,119,5.0
4331572,3,B004D7SBMU,"NOVA Science Now: How Does The Brain Work? like National Geographic's Brain Games shows how the brain can be fooled if we lose concentration. Brain Games does the same thing. Both use tricks to show how easy it is to fool someone. Neither DVD set gives the information I want to know about the human brain.
Instead I recommend NOVA's Secrets of the Mind hosted by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran, which goes much deeper into subjects such as phantom limb syndrome,intense spiritual experiences and how the brain rewires itself. See my review of NOVA Secrets of the Mind.",1359763200,23,560,4.783505154639175

It explains with simplicity and uses great visuals, examples and easy to understand language. This DVD can be used to expand your own knowledge, your children's knowledge or as a tool in education, substance abuse counseling or mental health education and treatment.",1347148800,13,552,7.0144927536231885
4331574,5,B004D7SBMU,"Abandoning psychology for neuroscience ... hmmmmmm, we might be a much more productive and adjusted society if more college students did precisely that.  Yes, get rid of an entire field that may not be doing much of a service at all, and put the funding into something that takes us strides forward.  Freud has long since been proved scary as an alien.",1330300800,3,352,4.661290322580645
4331575,3,B004D7SBMU,"Although the title asks a question, please don't expect to receive a definitive answer here.  I once saw a documentary on the mind and like much in science, it asked, ""Well, what happens when things do wrong?""  So it first looked at Alzheimer's and brains ravaged by tina, etc.  I could predict the structure of the documentary there, but not for this one.  Think of this doc as a series of minisodes.  It covers magic tricks, machine that can inhibit actions, synethesia (sp?), computers that can beat humans in games, etc.  This is just tracking what researchers around the nation happen to be studying.

There are many scenes here in which the narrator is shown interacting with another version of himself.  I have loved, loved, loved that in Eurythmics, Mariah Carey, or Madonna videos.  However, it felt silly here.  I think in music videos for women, they are studying contrasts and stock characters: good and evil, housewives and vamps, etc.  It wasn't done to express a deep concept, just to display a video trick.

The narrator concludes by saying, ""As chemistry was born out of alchemy, perhaps neuroscience will replace psychology.""  Despite his smile, I think many on college campuses will find that scary.  Departments often receive funds based on their number of majoring students.  Psychology departments would be trembling if all the students abandoned them for neuroscience.

This isn't something I would need to view again and again, or speak about for years to come.  However, it's a nice user-friendly watch.  It would be suitable for high school and junior high science class viewing.",1302566400,13,1605,4.992452830188679

8424874,2,B004D7SBMU,I was really looking for a dvd that would highlight areas of the brain and really break it down into functions.  Absolutely not what I was looking for.,1391299200,,151,4.392857142857143
