5158893,5,B008FXLYW2,"Yeah!! Christmas time is coming soon!! Well for my family it is already here. I start Christmas shopping and Christmas activities early just because I love this time of year! The Christmas Spirit is just a wonderful feeling to me! People are happier and jolly! I really do wish people would have that spirit all year long!

While my family loves Christmas I want to make sure they understand the true reason behind Christmas. It is not just about getting gifts! It is not always easy to teach these things to young children. That is why I am really loving the Veggie Tales The Ultimate Christmas Collection!

I have a two year old that is actually sitting down watching and LEARNING about the true meanings behind Christmas. Oh...and the songs are so cute! We play them in the car to! I know, I know, it is only the beginning of November :)

This is a 2-disc collection and includes  Holiday Favorites + 25 Favorite Christmas Songs CD!

It's a Meaningful Life ~ A wonderful story of learning to be happy with what you have.
The Little Drummer Boy ~ A heart string pulling wonderful story of learning about the birth of baby Jesus.
The Toy That Saved Christmas ~ This story reminds children that Christmas is not about getting, it is about giving.
The Star of Christmas ~ A very funny, action packed story of God's love.
Saint Nicholas ~ The Veggies discover the true joy of giving to others.
Christmas Sing-Alongs Songs ~ 10 silly songs with a karaoke feature so you can sing along :)

The way VeggieTales take a heart warming lesson and makes it fun to watch with silly song is wonderful!",1351987200,5,1589,4.538461538461538
5158894,5,B008FXLYW2,"Christmas is my favorite time of the year. With all the Secular Christmas Specials that come on I feel the need to really teach my kids about the True Meaning of Christmas.

The Veggie Tales: Ultimate Christmas Collection does just that.

I got a chance to Review this collection.  These are full length videos just like the original ones. Just by buying them all together you get the same movies all at a cheaper price.  As a mom on a budget I really like that.

Veggie Tales are one of those shows that even if you watch them, as an Adult, they can apply to you as the parent.  That's because each Veggie Tales is a story of God's Word with an application to your life.

I found myself crying with Steward as he compared his life to another's life.  St. Nicholas gave me a way of teaching my kids about who St. Nicholas really was and that he gave to those in need.  The Star of Christmas is a film about the struggle to be the best and how nothing else should be center in our life but Jesus.  The Little Drummer Boy taught me that, without Forgiveness, bitterness and an attitude of hate will grow.  The Toy That Saved Christmas reminded me of the Greed that can grow by not being content with what you have.

All tough Veggie Tales are meant for children they have a deeper meaning for Adults.  Often we learn a lot through our Children.

So this year, take the time.  Sit down and watch these videos with your children.  My children 9,7,5, and 3 loved these videos.  You as a parent will be blessed, while you laugh, cry and sing-a-long.

You can order this collection through the Veggie Tales Store.  You can also get the Veggie Tales Ultimate Christmas Collection on Amazon.

Here is a brief Synopsis of each of the videos along with some fun activities for your children.
It's a Meaningful Life: In this veggie-version of a holiday classic, Larry the cucumber he meets a mysterious train conductor who can turn back time, Stewart gets a chance to have the life he always wanted. Will he finally find all he's been looking for? And what does this mean for those he loves most? Find out in this story of wonder and a lesson in being content.
Saint Nicholas: Laura Carrot's Christmas stocking might be empty this year because her dad is in danger of losing his job. While Larry thinks a letter to the North Pole should fix the problem, Bob knows what will really help... and tells the story of a little boy named Nicholas who made a discovery in Bethlehem that changed Christmas forever. But what did Nick learn and how can it possibly help Laura and her family? Find out as the Veggies discover the true joy of giving to others - at Christmas time and throughout the year!
The Star of Christmas: (Bob and Larry) are putting the finishing touches on their first Christmas musical. With more electric lights than London has ever seen, Cavis is sure his show will ""teach London how to love!"" Unfortunately, the local church Christmas pageant is scheduled for the same night. Which will London turn out to see? Find out in this Christmas story adventure that encourages us to love each other. And more importantly, that God showed the greatest love of all when Jesus was born!
The Little Drummer Boy: In this Veggie-version of a holiday classic, Junior Asparagus stars as The Little Drummer Boy, a lonely child who finds the true meaning of Christmas when he stumbles upon the birth of the baby Jesus. A story of generosity, hope, and love, this timeless tale will warm the hearts of children everywhere!  You can print a coloring sheet  and  You can also make your own drum.

There are 6 stories total and there is also an included CD with 25 Christmas songs!

DVD #1 has 3 stories. These are:
-The Toy That Saved Christmas: The toymaker Wally P. Nezzer appears in his own toy commercials and has convinced the whole town of Dinkletown that ""Christmas is when you get stuff!"" The children in town start begging for more and more toys! One brave toy, Buzz-Saw Louis, decides to take matters into his own hands in order to save Christmas. This story helps to remind children that Christmas is about giving and not getting.

-The Star of Christmas: This story is set in 1880's London and Cavis Appythart and Millward Phelps are putting up the finishing touches on their first Christmas musical. Cavis believes this musical will teach London to love. There is also a church Christmas pageant that little Edmund Gilbert stages that is set to open that same night. How will Cavis make sure his show comes out on top? This story teaches all about God's love.

-Saint Nicholas: Laura Carrot's family is in trouble and headed for a presentless and treeless Christmas as her dad is in danger of losing his job after his truck breaks down! Larry believes a letter to Santa can fix the problem but Bob knows what will really help and that is to tell the story of a little boy named Nicholas who made a special discovery in Bethlehem that changed Christmas forever. But what was it he learned? In this story the veggies discover the true joy of giving to others.

The 2nd DVD includes:
-Christmas Sing-Along Songs!: These songs are sure to bring out smiles at Christmas time. Bob, Larry, and the rest of the veggies star in this sing-along for the whole family. It also includes 10 Silly Songs with a karaoke feature.

-It's a Meaningful Life: Stewart (Larry) plays in the biggest football game of his life and had a chance to win it. After he is injured in a bad play, his hopes are dashed. Years later, he loves his family, friends, and job but still wonders ""what if"" things were different. He meets a mysterious train conductor that can turn back time. He gets the chance of the live he wanted but will he find what he's looking for? The silly song ""Goodnight Junior"" is included in this story of wonder and lesson in being content.

-The Little Drummer Boy: When it feels you have nothing to bring what can you give the King? Junior stars as The Little Drummer Boy who is a lonely child who finds the true meaning of Christmas when he stumbles upon Baby Jesus. This is a story of hope, love, and forgiveness and also features the silly song ""8 Polish Foods of Christmas"".",1420502400,,2843,4.573673870333988

We popped all of them into our DVD player and have been enjoying them all season, and still. It is also great family fun to put the songs into the karaoke and all take turns singing! Good wholesome fun and great moral lessons for each video like Aesop's Fables. In today's society, it is nice to have something the whole family can enjoy. They are cartoons but make references to products and things that sometimes only the adults get the bigger joke, while the kids just think it is funny! Great stuff!",1388361600,,680,4.448

Now i had seen most of these before, except for The Star of Christmas. and i love them all. they are so clever and just all around great. its the best that there is the christmas cd too. i will definitely put all those songs (except feliz navidad cause i kinda despise that song) on my mp3 player come christmas time. the only thing bad about this collection is the singalong dvd. i just don't really see a point to those. maybe for older kids who can read but i'm not sure what else it is useful for.

other than that its awesome. i just love that they made a collection like this.",1361923200,7,1292,4.3940677966101696

5159002,5,B008FXLYW2,I bought this for my Grandkids. I paid less for the whole set than it would have cost for 2 dvds. This was a Great Product at a Great price and I am very happy with it.,1358985600,,168,3.5675675675675675

5159015,5,B008FXLYW2,"This collection does have at least 2 missing silly songs.  But for the money you pay for this, you could get this and then get the original movie for the ones that are missing a silly song.  St. Nicholas is one of the movies, if i remember correctly, that doesn't have a silly song.  Other than that, glad I got it.",1358121600,,315,4.131147540983607
5159016,5,B008FXLYW2,"Our 6 yr old grandson loves Veggie Tales . It is such a good introduction to Christian thought without being overtly religious which is very helpful in some family situations. I was also very pleasantly surprised how the story of St. Nicholas was presented mixing factual and conventional story. Also  ""Sing Along "" is such a good addition putting everybody into a Christmas spirit. Other stories may require more maturity from our kids or grand kids but we as parents and grand parents never know exactly  where the kids are so it is really fine. If they are not ready then they go away and will probably watch it next year with more understanding.",1358035200,,649,4.684210526315789
5159017,5,B008FXLYW2,I bought these for our new grand baby to start her collection.  Our older grand kids loved them.  They sang the songs together when they thought no one was listening.  Great memories.,1358035200,,183,4.65625

5159020,5,B008FXLYW2,"I love how the true meaning of Christmas- the birth of Jesus, as well as the reasons we give gifts, and even who Saint Nicholas was is all taught in this collection of Veggie movies.

My family truly enjoys VeggieTales, and if yours is anything like mine (and I'm guessing it is) then you'll love this entire collection. My four year old loves ""The Toys that Saved Christmas"" and actually seemed to understand that the true meaning of Christmas isn't about what gifts and new toys he receives.

My personal favorite is the story of Saint Nicholas. After watching it, my seven year old asked a few questions about Santa and I was able to openly discuss this with him from a point of view he could understand.

If you'd appreciate a little extra help entertaining your little ones while teaching them these valuable lessons this holiday season, then this VeggieTales collection could be an excellent option for you!",1356048000,,913,4.729559748427673

5159022,5,B008FXLYW2,"My kids and really my whole family have been fans of the Veggietales gang for a long time. The messages that they share are timeless and really hit home many of the values that my wife and I want to share with our kids. Thus, over the years our Veggietales collection has really grown and our kids have seen all of the DVDs that have come on the market (at least all that I know of).

This new DVD compilation set is great as it brings together all of the Christmas related shows in one DVD set (instead of having five individual DVD's sitting around the house, now you only have two main DVD's). Whats better though is that you get the messages that are shared in all of these DVD's. Each offer a slightly different look at God's love for all of us as well as powerful messages about love, friendship, understanding and so much more.

On top of this you get all of the great toe-tapping songs that stick in your head that also come with any VeggieTales DVD.

This set will definitely become a new family tradition that can be continued not only at Christmas, but at anytime during the year!",1355097600,,1091,4.338235294117647
5159023,2,B008FXLYW2,"I bought this just a few days ago and wanted to make everyone aware that this set is actually missing material. In addition to all bonus features from the original individual DVDs being gone (which I had a feeling they would be), the silly songs for ""The Toy That Saved Christmas"" and ""Saint Nick"" have been edited out. I'm not sure why the studio has done this or why no one else has caught it. While it's true that the price is good, why would you want shows that are very incomplete?",1354492800,41,486,4.293478260869565
5159024,5,B008FXLYW2,"My kids are a bit too young to enjoy ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but by watching VeggieTales ""It's a Meaningful Life"" they get the same message and learn to be grateful and content with what they have. This is really a perfect collection of shows to watch with your kids to help them learn about the meaning of Christmas.  And it helps that my husband and I also enjoy watching them. :)  They always crack me up :)",1352764800,6,410,4.243589743589744
