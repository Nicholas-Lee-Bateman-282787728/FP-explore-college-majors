1900622,5,B0000A1HTW,"""Angelina Ballerina: The Show Must Go On [Christmas in Mouseland] is a 50 minute feature length special. It's Christmas time, and there is a special musical performance titled 'Cinderella Mouse and the Ugly Whiskers', in honor of Queen Seraphina. Unfortunately, Angelina loses the coveted part of Cinderella Mouse to Priscilla Pinkpaws and is given the role of Wicked Stepmouse instead. This is a great blow to Angelina and the little mouse throws a diva-sized tantrum, refusing to play her assigned role and stalking off in a huff. Ms Lilly [voiced by Dame Judi Dench] takes on the role instead but is later house-bound after an accident. The director of the show,grumpy Mr Operatski decides to call of the show, and Angelina learns to swallow her pride so that the show may proceed.

Angelina does have her bad moments in this series, and resorts to some bad behavior, but she always learns from her mistakes in the end. This is another wonderful production in the DVD series. There are some special features here such as a picture album, and also a read-along feature.  The animation remains faithful to Helen Craig's beautiful illustrations, and on the whole, I'd recommend this to young aspiring dancers, preschoolers and up who love charming tales featuring lovable mice.",1240876800,2,1277,5.018867924528302
1900623,4,B0000A1HTW,It is a very charming and intelligent story with very good production quality.  My six year old and three year old Grandaughters love it.,1152403200,,137,4.708333333333333
1900624,5,B0000A1HTW,"My grandson (he is 3) LOVES Angelina.  And, unlike most of the squeaky voiced children's videos, the Angelina Ballerina videos are actually adult-friendly.  The artwork is lovely, the stories have morals/lessons, and what I like best is the music!  It is not only not irritating, but pleasant to listen to.  The voices are Judith Densch and her daughter, among others, and very British, but that is fun too.  If you like the books, you will LOVE the videos!",1130371200,6,457,4.8076923076923075

7995265,5,B0000A1HTW,There's no violence in this simple ballerina tale. My child loves it and watching the movie has my daughter spinning all over the living room. :),1387497600,,145,4.615384615384615
7995266,5,B0000A1HTW,"ALWAYS love Angelina Ballerina!!  We are a big fan of the cartoons, but NOT of the computer animation-look.  Angelina does whine, (the way she talks), but the colors, the setting, the charm, is outstanding!  Why can't they make cartoons like this anymore?",1385337600,,255,5.023809523809524
7995267,4,B0000A1HTW,"Angelina movies are so cute! Only two parts that i did not like was when the male dance teacher yelled at the mouslings for spilling cabbage all over the dance floor and the end song. The dance teacher ended up realizing that you have to be patient with small children as they learn and apologized, so if your an angry parent, look up to this example. But my daughter's eyes opened up so wide when she saw that. The end song talked about being wicked and and the best way to be. I know its part of a ""play"" but....not what i'd want my daughter to sing back to people. If you can ignore those two parts, the movie is still good.",1382054400,,627,4.147540983606557
