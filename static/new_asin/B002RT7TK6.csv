8378860,5,B002RT7TK6,"I purchased this archive memorial as a tribute to my father.  He served with General Merrill in WWII and I was delighted to see actual footage of my father during this time.  Sad that a boy of 17 served in Burma but a learning experience for those that were not there.  If one wishes to purchase this historical archive, I recomment getting the move ""Merrill's Marauders"" as well.  Not many of the men were referred to by their ""right"" name, however my father was in just about all the footage that Hollywood produced.  Knicknames were used, and my father was ""Bullseye"".

I am very proud of him for what he deemed a necessity to serve his country.",1400457600,7,648,4.495726495726496
8378861,4,B002RT7TK6,"The Burma-India-China theatre of World War II is the one most forgotten and at the time was among the most challenging, with latent nationalism burning under war activity in the entire region. There are some valuable and real war film footage here that bears witness of what real jungle fighting was like, rather than the Hollywood version.",1363910400,2,340,4.982456140350878
8378862,5,B002RT7TK6,"This is another superb film transfer to DVD via the NARA/Amazon partnership.  The description on the website, and on the DVD case is WAY wrong.  It states this is color footage of P-47's (Actually the film 'Thunderbolt'), in fact this is the text that should accompany this DVD (from NARA's website):

""This film covers the secret campaign, under General Frank D. Merrill, to reopen the Burma Road behind enemy lines during World War II. The film was photographed and produced by David L. Quaid.""

Other then this mistake, this is a great DVD of rare footage!",1255564800,9,559,4.791666666666667
