3908856,5,B002D1XK74,"Lovely film, a people and a time gone by. Everyone can appreciate this film - it's not a just a chic flick.",1501545600,,107,3.909090909090909
3908857,5,B002D1XK74,The filmography was breathtaking.  Acting excellent.  The storyline well developed.  ....and it was based on a true story.  I loved it.,1501113600,,135,5.285714285714286
3908858,1,B002D1XK74,This movie was a bit too slow for me and I feel the young boy was very disrespectful to the older man. I have an older friend and I would never talk to her that way and such filthy language. He was also disrespectful to his father .The story was interesting but lacked  a good plot. I recommend you look elsewhere for a movie worth watching .,1499126400,2,342,4.104477611940299
3908859,3,B002D1XK74,"I really enjoyed the story and I felt it developed well. Personally I also enjoyed the insight the film provided into the medium of painting. I thought it was wonderful. While the film felt a tad low budget, I thought the cast did a wonderful job and the score was nice. If you are in the mood for a feel good film and you like art, this might be for you.",1498953600,,355,4.014084507042254
3908860,5,B002D1XK74,"Captivating story, and like a great work of art, captures the heartbreak, beauty and joy of the shared experience between a painter of renown and a young artist. A collateral message and one to which I wholeheartedly ascribe is that modern art is so much garbage and that the masters of previous ages knew that to represent the world as they saw it was the real gift. Abstracting nature's beautiful forms into weird shapes and sharp edges and spattered paint etc. is emotionally empty. Armin Mueller-Stahl inhabited this character so perfectly I don't think the movie would be what it is without him. His piercing blue eyes communicate so much of the love, joy and struggle of life. I truly enjoyed this film and in moments found it very, very moving. Ich habe den Film wirklich genossen!! Auch die Schonheit der Landschaft. (I was an exchange student in Germany at one time!!)",1496188800,7,877,4.776315789473684

3908886,5,B002D1XK74,"I really don't understand how this movie slipped through the cracks, according to IMBD it only grossed $48,895! This movie was well acted and written and the cinematography was spectacular. A beautiful coming of age story about a fledgling artist learning to see beauty in a world full of despair and cynicism.",1486598400,,310,4.980769230769231

3908895,2,B002D1XK74,"Cougar film! I enjoyed the film up until the1:07:04  ""want some coco"" speech nonsense.  This situation would never happen period.  The script is poorly written, yet I get the message that the writer(s) were trying to come up with.  It's a beautiful message of a young reject being taught by an old reject.  Together, they give each other meaning in a cruel world.  However, I couldn't put up with the bull s**t anymore at 1:27:00  It's just lost in translation for many I'm sure.  I love these films about art/artist, e.g. Mr. Turner, but this one gets half marks.

Rating should be 2.5 stars any that's very generous...",1485561600,,620,4.666666666666667
3908896,5,B002D1XK74,Fabulous beautiful emotional well written and filmed,1485475200,,52,6.571428571428571
3908897,5,B002D1XK74,This is one of many movies my wife and I missed seeing several years ago. It portrays very well the process of a young person learning from an old expert in art who describes his feelings and the principles of good painting in an abundance of profanity. Ron Perlman has only a peripheral role as a pseudo-expert in art who is exposed as ignorant in an amusing scene involving handicapped children's scribbles. The boy who learns about becoming a painter has a home life with a father who is contemptuous of art but later accepts his son's talent and ambitions. This movie develops the personalities of the main characters very realistically.,1485475200,6,641,4.783783783783784

3908900,3,B002D1XK74,"The best part of this movie about a young man with a passion for art, is how he pursued his interest despite family reservations.",1485388800,,129,4.416666666666667
3908901,5,B002D1XK74,Great story and excellent acting,1485388800,,32,5.6
3908902,5,B002D1XK74,"I have watched this movie 6 times.  It is a beautiful movie celebrating art and the artist's inner life. The acting is fantastic!  Such an intelligent movie with great dialogue.  If the f word offends you beware, but tin this movie it works.",1485302400,,241,4.558139534883721
3908903,4,B002D1XK74,"Local color is an interesting movie that was a bit slow unwinding, but well acted and enjoyable.",1485216000,,96,4.705882352941177

3908915,1,B002D1XK74,I love Ron Perlman and Ray Liotta. Did not like this movie. Kept waiting for it to get better. Stiff acting. Dialog was sappy. I am an oil painter so was excited to connect...that didn't happen.,1485129600,,194,4.416666666666667

3908923,3,B002D1XK74,I found this film a bit choppy but it sure turned up the volume on my how-to-see-the-world reciever. The use of the first person voice at the beginning and end was effective and special to the core story.,1484006400,,204,4.394736842105263

3908962,4,B002D1XK74,"Like many European films, it is unassuming.  Vivid, quirky characters and terrific acting.  It has a lot to say about a painter's eye and has a wonderful satirical bit about the contemporary art scene.",1483228800,,201,4.882352941176471

3908986,4,B002D1XK74,A very touching and honest story about a complicated and simple relationship. I loved it for it's ability to allow me inside these wonderful characters. Pacing was a bit slow.,1482883200,,175,4.866666666666666
3908987,4,B002D1XK74,An interesting story. The interaction between an old artist and a young inspiring artist is a contrast in life. The young artist is also having problems with family that don't believe in his artistic talents. Good acting all around.,1482796800,,232,4.9743589743589745

3909006,5,B002D1XK74,"No shooting, no violence, no explosions.  This movie is an excellent attempt to show us, the less artistic public, how painters look at the world.  In my opinion it succeeds very well.  I highly recommend it.",1481932800,13,208,4.722222222222222

3909010,5,B002D1XK74,Awesome coming of age story. I was reminded that being an artist is real work. The experienced artist teaches more than how to paint. His relationships with his protg and other friends are teaching moments in themselves. Sons of anarchy actor ron pearl man deftly plays a flamboyant self absorbed art analyst to perfection. Loved this movie!,1481846400,,341,5.0

3909026,3,B002D1XK74,The story line was moderately entertaining but a little difficult to follow due to the poor soundtrack quality. I was personally disappointed that there was not more shown of actual painting. I am interested in George Gallo's artwork and had hoped to see some glimpses.,1481328000,,269,5.0

Bad, really bad. The casting of the young artist played by Trevor Morgan, nah, didn't connect with his character even remotely.

This film literally used broad sweeping strokes, to ""enlighten"" us about the art world and the cynicism, the four or five ""deep"" insights into artwork, the sappy art history Cliff Notes.

3909173,5,B002D1XK74,"The Color of Experience

  George Gallo's film, Local Color has taken the word riveting and has successfully raised its meaning to a new charted height, for this film has opened my eyes more, and has given me the return opportunity to recall the powerful direction I received from my first mentor.

  The film truly drives home its message of never giving up on one's dreams, but more than the latter, to make that road not taken beyond a destiny; moreover, a journey that quenches the soul from acquiring newfound knowledge fighting to get out

  I can guarantee you whether you are two inches or 10 feet back from your viewing screen, Gallo's Local Color will create a link to that one special person in your life. Be prepared for an ocean of onslaught of emotions because the film's entire acting and production cast merges color and composition in a way that viewer just can't let go.

  On the language side, I found its restricted rating right on; in fact, somewhat sickening because too much of it expressed in a short time, however Local Color is still a must see in my assessment; in fact, I recommend it to anyone who wants to see the distance between the inexperienced and experienced, for this is where the age difference prevails with a dramatic contrasting greatness.

  There is only one question that remains in my mind, being, I wonder if today's youth could withstand the verbal mental swings that tend to rise above flood stage when a mentor runs out of steam and has no time to count to ten, however one must stand back and see how well the people give and take, follow and return to their travels on life's yellow brick road.

3909267,4,B002D1XK74,"If you appreciate art, particularly impressionist / neo-impressionist, and feel a sense of frustration with the art scene of most of the 20th century and beyond, you might like this film. It has some beautiful moments that give you such a sense of inspiration...but then it has some other moments that could have been a lot better. Nonetheless, I think I would still recommend this film to the right person, with the caveat that it has quite a number of cringe moments. I would do this because much of it does ring true...and I guess I am a sap, because the film can hit you even when you feel like it really shouldn't. I definitely wanted to cry in a number of places, while wondering at the same time, ""why do I want to cry? The scene is so awkward!"" It has that sort of odd mix to it.

I think those who are frustrated with the ""modern"" art scene (I have no idea what they call it these days) might get a great kick out of some of the scenes, and maybe even see themselves in it a little bit. I know the scene at the local art show...wow, I could see myself in Nicholi's reactions for sure! I would love to give some of the judges of local art shows a little bit of the ""truth,"" like how Nicholi did! And slap a blue ribbon on a fan! Nice! And the painter with the black canvas, philosophizing like a spin doctor on too much weed over the nonsense he had produced...wow, that rings true to so many things that I see today, at gallerys and art shows alike!

Yet the scene where he tricked his friend into thinking that children's art works are great innovations by a new artist...I had to cringe. For one, it was a little cruel. But that aside, as an artist he ought to have been aware of how the Impressionists in their day were also mocked as having no talent, and how people at the time said that children could paint better than them! Seroff's work appears to be based on Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism, and his constant references to Monet, Renoir....he should have known that people used to do something rather similar to them, which sort of invalidated his point. Plus, was it Picasso or Matisse who said, ""It took me four years to learn how to paint like Raphael, and a lifetime to learn how to paint like a child."" Many more ""modern"" artists wanted to paint like children so to speak, and so his friend could have easily defended himself by pointing this out - that children often have more raw energy and feeling than adults, and that great artists strove to paint like children, and would probably see it as a compliment to be compared to the works of children, even retarded ones (a little low to use retarded children...they are so special in a good way but often so put down...should have just used regular children).

That said, I am not taking up for modern art. I agree with much of what this film said. I just found it surprising that they could not remember that their own arguments had been used against their own style of art at one time, as well as their heroes such as Monet, and that many modern artists after the Impressionists/Neo-Impressionists wanted to paint like children. It would have made their opinions stronger if the film had faced these issues head on, provided answers to them, and not ignored them. I do hope the art world wakes up at some point though. It has just gone too far off the deep end.",1447459200,2,3342,4.395799676898223

It speaks of life and loss, friendship and mentorship and finding beauty in what looks to be the mundane to others. This film shows what it means to be an artist, how deeply we feel, the drive we have to create that springs from somewhere within us that we can not explain.  It speaks of our pain and sorrow and even our joy at spotting that light tint of pink at the edge of a cloud. This film was a great learning tool in how to really look at your surroundings, to ""SEE"" objects and nature the way they truly are, to see the swirling colors and the dancing light.

3909343,5,B002D1XK74,"This movie is almost a chick flick. It's relational, but with an edginess that some men would appreciate who don't normally go for ""girly flicks"". I personally loved the way the modern art world was exposed for the phonies they are, and the added bonus of the best definition of art I've ever heard. It calls lazy effortless thoughtless ""art"" what it really is...passionless pretentious crap. The characters are real - even if there are a few editing gaps like how the wallpaper that was falling down magically got pasted up and what happened to that brush and bucket of paint that was just left out on the ladder. Or maybe I'm just being picky because I'm a wallpaper hanger and painter. Despite that, I loved this movie for all it's other redeeming qualities.",1441756800,,761,4.686567164179104

Makes us wonder why and what is the point yet in the end we learn we must continue to learn exprience and do life right to the end. . This is a movie which is really a calm movie with much to learn.

This is one of the most heart-warming, entertaining, breath-taking films I've ever seen - story of a young boy yearning to become an artist - ""not because of the money"" - who insists his way into getting a crotchety old landscape painter (Nickolai - played by Muerller-Stahl) to become his mentor. Against his father's wishes (Ray Liotta) the boy goes to the mentor's country home in the wilds of Pennsylvania.  Their relationship is a difficult one, but it becomes obvious to the mentor's friend played humorously and delightfully by Ron Perlman who says to Nickolai ""my, you two really are peas in a pod.""

3909669,5,B002D1XK74,"I read over the other reviews for Local Color and felt they missed what might be the essential message of this film: that the pursuit of love and beauty is essential to the survival of human spirit and civilization, if not to the survival of our species. I recently heard an art critic defend the great painter Norman Rockwell against those who find his work to be overly sentimental and irrelevant. The critic noted that Rockwell's work was humorous and kind and that he always respected his subjects. What's not to like about kindness and respect? This art critic's sentiment seemed to me to be a less passionate expression of Local Color's brilliant old painter Nicolai Seroff railing against the arrogant and empty elitism of the postmodern art movement. Nicolai had the courage to call out the championing of ugliness and moral bankruptcy in this movement, which tacitly conspires to destroy all that is beautiful and noble in our lives. He knew this art form was ""bull----,"" like the communist revolution that led to the death of his family in Russia. Over time he felt worn down and defeated by the cowardice of so-called intellectuals afraid to admit that this postmodern emperor wore no clothes. Nicolai's nihilist despair was reinforced by his ongoing conversations with his academic artist friend Curtis, an oh so intellectual but emotionally hollow fellow traveler who is finally defeated when Nicolai tricks him into thinking that some slapdash paintings made by retarded children were the work of an undiscovered postmodern artist.  Nicolai then asks Curtis, as an expert in this form of art, to judge the quality of these paintings.  In what may be this film's funniest and most redeeming scene, the pompous Curtis holds forth on the deep meaning and refined significance of this new artist's work.  Nicolai unmasks the lie of this art form to the delight of his young student John.  At least for a time, and in the local place of the old teacher's sphere of influence, the evil soul destroying force of postmodernism is defeated.  As in the wonderful 1998 film Pleasantville, ""local color"" is restored to the living and the good.

In the best of our classic traditions love wins out in the end.  Nicolai has succeeded in making a hero's journey in daring to overcome his cynicism and attend to his devoted student's needs.  This courageous old teacher is able to pass on to John something of the great beauty-making talent he has developed over a lifetime of struggle, dedication, and passionate devotion to his craft. This story could also apply to the cancer of postmodernism in philosophy, academia, and politics. As an old man myself, this film gave me hope that smart and creative people are beginning to wake up to the tyranny of political correctness and the antiheroic lie of postmodern cynicism. God is not dead. God is love and truth and beauty.",1315008000,6,2871,4.893004115226337

3909674,5,B002D1XK74,"This isn't ""Karate Kid"" for painters--it's ""Karate Kid for Artists."" And there is a big difference between the two. Mr. Seroff's views of art and artists as portrayed in this film are the kind that send the artistic intelligentsia limping back to their Dojo. I remember having these same heated arguments with my Fine Arts professors in college and I would have loved to have had Mr. Seroff (Miyagi) in my corner. I hope the real young artist who learned from this man knows how blessed he was to have his influence in his life.

It is a shame that the trailer for this movie seemed to focus so much on the scenes where Seroff is cursing like a sailor. My wife is more sensitive to foul language than I am, and she was a bit hesitant to see it for that reason, but actually, the movie as a whole was not nearly as coarse as expected. We both felt that the only weak parts of the movie related to the young artist's love interest. Nevertheless, for someone like myself, who has been making a living as a professional artist for over forty years, I found the movie and the story, both engaging and encouraging. If you are the kind of person who has any artistic bent at all, I highly recommend you see this movie, even if you choose not to make it a part of your DVD library.",1266796800,6,1273,4.304166666666666

3909685,5,B002D1XK74,"I'm a little surprised there are not more reviews on this movie. I found it to be fresh and satisfying, like cool water on a hot day.

I have struggled for years with the image of the artist as tortured soul driven to brush or pen or whatever by the dark flecks that drive the human psyche. Certainly some artists are like that, but some of us are more normally dysfunctional, more interested in the old idea of creating beauty, of moving another person, of expressing deep truths for other's to appreciate. This is the essential message of this movie, that the true purpose of art is not self-expression (or at least not just that), but that art can give others a way to see how beautiful the world is.

The two main actors, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Trevor Morgan, give flawless performances. Mueller-Stahl is particularly good at delivering dense and rich lines as if they are natural and flowing from a lifetime of thought and realization. There is something authentic and authoritative about his delivery.

In some ways the film is a criticism of ""modern art"" and a call to appreciate nature and beauty as the common purview of all human creativity, but on a deeper level it is about how we as people can become beautiful if we embrace the role of artist as ""lifter of human souls"".

If you agree with this basic premise then I'm not sure there is any way to not like the movie. It is well produced, the cinematography is good, and the story is nicely familiar while also being interestingly different. It is basically the mentor/student story arch but the content of the work being learned by the young artist is presented, unabashadly, as something important and almost sacred.

My only criticism is the content of the narration. It seemed in places to boarder on platitude, especially compared to the dialogues of the main characters, but this is a minor point.

There is an innocence, truthfulness, and purity about this film that I look forward to dipping into again and again when my motivation flags.",1264118400,12,2010,4.6960227272727275

3909688,4,B002D1XK74,"LOCAL COLOR is one of those films that move sensitive audience members despite its flaws.  The story by George Gallo (also responsible for the script) is based on a true event - the coming together of a young student artist with a crusty alcoholic master painter and how one summer of cohabitation in the beauty of Pennsylvania's countryside sets the stage for the transformation of each.  The idea is excellent and the story does indeed provide information about the importance of representational art in a world preferring the jolt of 'progressive art' for both the novice art appreciator and art students - among other values - but the dialogue at times is so repetitive and predictable that the mood frequently changes inappropriately.

Armin Mueller-Stahl lends his usual credibility to the tortured soul of Nicoli Seroff, a Russian landscape artist of advanced years who came to America after the Stalin purges murdered his family and his wife Anya and who now paints very little because of his disillusionment with the contemporary art scene and the tenor of the times.  Down the street (the film begins in Port Chester, New York - the year is 1974) lives a lad named John Talia, Jr (Trevor Morgan) who is at odds with his inner need to create art and the world of 'normal boys' as viewed by his father (Ray Liotta).  Through a series of instances John discovers Nicoli and after frustrated attempts to study art with the master, Nicoli begrudgingly invites John to his summer studio in the wilds of Pennsylvania.  There the two grow into each other's worlds, in part due to the external influences of art critic Curtis Sunday (Ron Perlman) and the lonely Carla (Samantha Mathis) - a young girl whose only child is now dead and who lives for the closeness of caring for Nicoli.  How the boy and the master mend fences and learn form each other is the story of a summer of enlightenment.

The acting is very fine, the photography matches the mood of the landscapes each of the two characters approach, and the story line  is touching.  Gallo somehow finds it necessary to pepper his dialogue with two expletives that grow boring and seem like laziness on the part of the script writing.  But once over this bothersome hurdle the result of this film is a touching tribute to the concept of inspiration and the camaraderie of master and pupil.  Especially fine for art students who are faced with the dilemma of representational versus non-representational expression in art.  Grady Harp, October 09",1255219200,23,2503,4.833723653395785
3909689,1,B002D1XK74,"I must not have seen the same movie as the other reviewers. Armin Mueller-Stahl manages to overcome his ridiculous dialogue and create a character of interest, but the 'arguments' between him and Ron Perlman about the nature of art are apparently lifted from 50 All-Time Greatest Cliches About Art. Writer-Director Gallo has been around a long time, and is a painter himself, but the art concepts and definitions fly around like shrapnel, dropping out of the mouths of characters who have managed to memorize Webster's Dictionary without grasping the meaning of the terms. And all accompanied by a music score that swells up to jarring dramatic heights worthy of a Monty Python film. Perlman is a terrific actor, but how he was able to stare at a developmentally challenged child's painting (after being told it was by a promising new contemporary painter) and talk about the 'depth' of the painting and the 'sadness' and 'rage' and 'emotional pain' while keeping a straight face is beyond me. Yes, the scene is supposed to be funny, showing us the shallowness of his pretensiousness, but the writing is strictly out of a high school drama. I turned it off after that.

The Amazon trailer and editorials cover nicely this period art film's attempt at showing one young man's summer spent with an icon in the canvas painting industry. Trevor Morgan and Armin Mueller Stahl fill the lead roles wonderfully as student and mentor. Ron Perlman plays the gayishly flamboyant friend of the old man, and having just recently watched the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-of-Anarchy-Season-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0024FAR5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons of Anarchy: Season One [Blu-ray</a>] I think he deserves an Oscar nod for proving his diversity and believability here. The story unfolds over a summer of learning about life, love and the passion needed to paint successfully. A nice touch is the film's narrator having a Stand By Me feel (older man voice but teen character); I liked it.

The supplements include a 8:15 minute making of that contains a little too much from the film and not enough meat on the production, but it still contained some decent info. The interviews with the actors (Armin, Trevor and Samantha Mathis) supplement lasts 14:35 minutes and covers a thorough background regarding their characters and thoughts on the film. The George Gallo's studio piece is a two minute pan/scan of his painting studio; it looks like what you would expect a painter's room to appear if you toured it.

The film has a genuine feel of one learning about art and painting even if you are not a painter. The laugh out loud moments are punctuated with solid and heartfelt dramatic moments, and the scenery is used perfectly (like looking at a canvas). It will be on my recommendation list for customers, and I am glad to see it getting poster and ad placement. Enjoy.",1252108800,21,1981,5.302547770700637

8364701,2,B002D1XK74,"Wooden acting by the young protege.  As noted by someone else, F bombs throughout the movie.  I would like for a film of art inspiration to be one young folks could watch without vulgarity.  It is not needed.  The old artist, Armin Mueller-Stahl, was decent to watch, although certainly not his best performance but still worthy.  Ron Perlman plays the guy who so steeped in progressive art so much that he cannot even identify the work of a small child but searches for the deep meaning in blue squares or a red brushed stroked x!  If you want to watch a lot of drinking, listen to a bunch of curse words and a put down of a family that cared about their son, then this might be for you. I am disappointed to say the least.  I have Gallo's book on art and hope that it rises above the level of this movie directed and written by George Gallo.",1511049600,2,843,4.264150943396227
