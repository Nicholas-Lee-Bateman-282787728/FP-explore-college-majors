6243347,3,B00HYCO0J4,"Of course, a must if you're a True Blood fan or collect the DVD's, like I do.  I had never actually seen this season until it came out on DVD.  Wow, was I surprised!  A lot of drama; little excitement; very little intrigue and even less ""thrills,"" like past seasons.  It was very predictable and the ending left me feeling I had wasted seven years of time.  Having read the books, I wasn't too happy with the way they ended the series.  That being said, I AM a fan and have every other season, so, I had to have it.  You may feel the same way.",1477440000,6,543,4.066037735849057

6243352,1,B00HYCO0J4,"Bought this season tried it in both my DVD & Blu-ray player and this didn't work. When I asked to return the movie I was given the return label, but was not informed that I would not be getting my money back because it wasn't shrink wrapped. How is anyone supposed to know if it is going to work without opening it. Buyers are not informed that it is formatted for a different country which is why it doesn't work. So I just ate $25 & they have the product. Basically they have stolen from a customer",1466380800,20,500,4.164948453608248
