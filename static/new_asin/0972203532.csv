173859,5,0972203532,"I first saw some of Meinrad Craighead's art in the early 80s.  This wonderful video explores her work and life.  It shows representative images of her art, and includes commentary by a number of different women.  It's a good intro to Craighhead and what her art means to her, what moves her to create beautiful, haunting and challenging images of the god the mother.",1249257600,5,366,4.6875
173860,5,0972203532,"Meinrad Craighead is an amazing mystic/artist and so is the Praying With Images DVD.  It works in every way- this beautifully produced DVD compellingly captures Meinrad's life, art, and the natural world in which she is integrally embedded. The DVD rings true to what I know of Meinrad over several decades of acquaintance. The audience of several hundred artists, writers, friends, family, healers and the spiritually-inspired at the recent film opening in New Mexico was clearly absorbed, delighted, and transported into a sacred space that Meinrad's presence and vision evoke.  This is a DVD that is so rich that you will want to watch it many times to absorb all that it has to offer on so many levels.",1249257600,11,706,4.92436974789916

I have some books but the dvd Praying with Images is more powerful and moved me to tears. The film is well presented and has suitable music. I have never paid more than 15 quid for a dvd but this was good value and the experience was priceless.

7794475,5,0972203532,"It is wonderful to be able to see Meinrad talk about her past and see her in her studio working. She is a very powerful, sensitive artist. My only problem with this documentary is that I found it a little short at one hour and wished I could see at least another hour's worth. She takes you into the realm of the sacred and I find that inspiring, as an artist who likes to work that way as well. I hope that more people get to know who Meinrad Craighead is through this documentary. Meinrad's artwork and life are very rich and full of a spiritual depth that is rare.",1276473600,3,567,4.163636363636364

7794477,5,0972203532,"I first became aware of the immensely gifted artist and mystic Meinrad Craighead in 1989 when I came upon her book `The Mother's Songs: Images Of God The Mother' while browsing around a Catholic bookstore in Costa Mesa, California. I was struck by the vibrant colors and evocative image on the cover. Looking within I was immediately taken aback, it was akin to opening Pandora's Box. The contents were highly evocative, strangely threatening and deeply personal. I intuitively understood that I was being exposed to a depth and scope of spirituality that was unlike anything I had experienced up to that point in my life. Momentarily confused, I couldn't help but wonder why this book was on the shelf of a Catholic shop. It most certainly didn't resonate with anything Catholic that I was aware of. My initial opinion would change in time.

Not long after discovering this little gem Meinrad's `The Litany Of The Great River' was released and my journey into her fascinating inner landscapes and sacred spaces continued. Now eighteen years later I have finally been given the opportunity to meet this incredible, unique woman through this lovingly crafted documentary film. Her life, her work, her inner thoughts are all there pulled up from the depths and brought into the light via the vehicle of cinema. Absolutely spellbinding. I may never get the opportunity to meet her, but at least I have `Meinrad Craighead: Praying In Images' to watch whenever I feel the need to return and rest in the ""dark beauty"" and ""divine gaze"" of the Great Mother.

Personal Note: The only contents I have an issue with is the glaring absence of a masculine perspective of this amazing woman. There are numerous comments and appearances sprinkled throughout the video by family, friends and fellow artists and only one of these individuals are male. Even more bothersome was the fact that several times during the film the narrator mentions how inspiring Meinrad has been to so many women. Can't men be inspired as well? The divine Goddess is a universal image with a universal message accessible to both genders. I hope the makers of this beautiful documentary didn't intentionally leave us out. That would surely be a disservice to both Meinrad's legacy and the Goddess.",1251849600,21,2258,4.955145118733509

Deep authentic story is medicine and this visual chronicle of the evolution of Meinrad Craighead's art and spirituality is food for the soul.  Whether you are meeting her phenomenal artistry for the first time or have followed her work for decades, you will find this film inspirational.  Meinrad's images are visual myths that make the invisible visible.  Moreover, her simple daily rituals done with deep reverence suggest a path to guide and inform our own quests.  This exemplary documentary spotlights what is possible when one listens deeply with the ears of the heart and surrenders to that call.  I highly recommend it.",1249430400,13,647,5.123809523809523

When I saw the premiere screening of this DVD I was impressed with the integrity with which it captures her art, her personal stories, and the profound impact her work has had on others.
