6155613,4,B00HE01030,"The Hidden Fortress takes place in a war-ravaged feudal Japan. Two peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matakishi (Kamatari Fujiwara) have escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp and are heading home when they encounter General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune). The General tells the men he knows where a large amount of gold can be found, and enlists their help transporting Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara) to safety. With Yuki disguised as a mute farming girl and the gold hidden in bundles of sticks, the small group travels the countryside avoiding enemy soldiers except when the General is forced to take action.

Director Akira Kurosawas primary inspiration is American films, particularly those of John Ford. The Hidden Fortress is different from many of the directors films in that it is as much a comedy as an adventure movie. The story is told from the point of view of secondary characters. Tahei and Matakishi are bumbling and greedy and provide lots of the humor. According to George Lucas, these characters were the inspiration for C3PO and R2D2 in Star Wars.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Dual-Format Blu-ray/DVD edition include audio commentary, a 2003 making-of documentary, a 2001 interview with George Lucas about Kurosawa, and a booklet featuring a critical essay. The film is in Japanese, with English subtitles. The Criterion Collection releases continue to be the most elegantly packaged with the best quality pictures, particularly of older films.",1395187200,3,1462,5.2703862660944205
6155614,5,B00HE01030,"Received my pre-order a day early from another retailer who had a better deal. I've been waiting a very long time for Criterion to release a blu-ray edition of this incredibly entertaining film. I must say, they did a stellar job of overhauling the visuals to a level this film has never even come close to. The clarity of the film's widescreen format with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1 is breathtaking. There will be two large black bars on top and bottom of the screen. It seems noticeably brighter and the contrast level is maxed out. You might want to tone down the brightness level a notch or two in order to make it easier on the eyes for the next 2 1/2 hrs. The blacks are deep and the visual integrity is near 3 dimensional. You won't get that fuzzy low rez blur that you get from lower quality formats. The close-ups of faces are incredibly detailed to the point where you can see their pores, sweat, wrinkles, and grunge. The foreground as well as the background is crisp and detailed. It's hard to believe such a dramatic makeover could be possible with a film nearly 60 yrs old. The subtitles are brighter and much easier to read. There is noticeable grain throughout the film which is intended and doesn't detract from the enjoyment rather it's appreciative. Don't see how this film can get any better.

There are 3 audio options; original monaural, 3.0 perspecta simulated surround, and a commentary from the Japanese film scholar Stephen Prince. The commentary is very insightful and highly entertaining. Other options include the making of the film called ""It is wonderful to create"" and a short interview with George Lucas; how he was influenced by Kurosawa in SD quality.

The case includes a small booklet which has the chapter selections as well as an insightful introduction from another film scholar Catherine Russell. The DVD and Blu-Ray discs are arranged from top and bottom inserts instead of separate spindles to minimize space as well as cost.

Now that you've read my spiel. Go click ""confirm purchase"" now!",1395014400,31,2032,4.7507082152974505
6155615,5,B00HE01030,"the hidden fortress is often relagated to a place behind other more popular works of kurosawa like yojimbo, sanjuro, ran etc. but imo this movie is second only to seven samurai in terms of development of the plot and characters, acting, direction and sheer entertainment.

the plot is pretty simple - a defeated kingdom, a princess on the run, a loyal general, two greedy bumbling peasants who unaware of the true identity of the princess are used by the general to aid them in their escape.

the movie is in turns comic, adventurous and action packed.

kurosawa's greatness lies in bringing to the fore the pettiness of human greed and the greatness of idealism and loyalty. over the course of the movie the two peasants who are initially lured into the enterprise with the promise of gold, over a period of time as the plot develops are so enveloped by greed that they simply become human personification of greed itself! the transformation is done/shown so beautifully.

toshiro mifune plays the loyal general who skillfully manges the two peasants and also charts the course of the party's escape over enemy territory.

the movie also features a beautifully done spear fight between mifune and an enemy general.

brilliant movie this! criterion's print is superb too. enjoy!!!",1394841600,2,1280,4.957943925233645
6155616,4,B00HE01030,"Certainly good, but I don't believe it is one of Kurosawa's best.  I would not rate it in the same category as Yojimbo, Seven Samurai or Kagemusha.  I wouldn't even compare it to Dersu Uzula.  Probably more in the range of Sanjuro or Red Beard.  Good, but not great.  Frankly, I am surprised it received such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

I found the comparisons to Star Wars more interesting than the movie itself.  The similarities are beyond numerous.  Lucas freely admitted that he used the film when making Star Wars, but it is still fascinating to see how he translated the plot line into a science fiction movie.  For that alone, it is worth watching.",1393200000,3,663,4.598290598290598
6155617,5,B00HE01030,"I will probably get the blu-ray version. Already have the DVD. Best Kurosawa movie and one of Mifune's best. I have over 300 Japanese movies and this is my favorite. If you are looking for a samurai movie with a lot of fighting scenes, this isn't the movie for you. Lucas has admitted that he got the basic idea for Star Wars from this movie. The main plot is a general trying to take a princess through enemy territory to get her home with the help of two bumbling peasants. The two peasants provide most the comedy with Mifune playing a stoic samurai leader. Great movie and I highly recommend getting it.",1390003200,27,607,4.428571428571429
6155618,5,B00HE01030,"I just can't believe there's no review on this amazing movie.  Incredible.  Please look this movie up elsewhere online and read the reviews you can find.  Even Rotten Tomatoes gives it 5 stars.  Anything I write won't come close to some of the more insightful reviews on this fantastic movie.  I will say this, the hilarious scenes starring the 2 peasants forced to accompany the General (the great Toshiro Mifune giving another one of his amazing performances) and the Princess throughout the movie were the inspiration for R2-D2 and C3PO in Star Wars.  Pretty cool trivia fact.  If you're put off by sub-titles, that's a shame.  You're missing some of the greatest movies ever made by one of history's greatest directors.  I can watch this or Kurasawa's Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ran, Throne of Blood, Kagemusha and Rashomon all day long.  (Sorry, I couldn't pick just one once I started.  And I'm know I left some out.)  Of course, Seven Samurai is an all day long movie just by itself..lol.",1389398400,62,992,4.804733727810651
6155619,5,B00HE01030,"This is the movie that lead George Lucas to create Star Wars.  The movie is told from the Point of View of Tahei and Matashichi, two common men who get tricked into helping a Young Princess, Yuki and her older wiser mentor General Rokurota Makabe. Tahei and Matashichi became R2D2 and CP3O.  There are some minor changes but you can see the resemblance.  Toshiro Mifune is  an actor of many talents and does a great job of leading helping Princess Yuki (Leia), She is ready to fight when she has too, but when the situation requires it she also shows great compassion for a girl of 16.  There is no Darth Vader Equivalent in the movie, but if you look at the Samurai helmets, you will see a very close resemblance to Darth Vader's helmet.  There is a certain bleakness in Kurosawa films.  Much of the landscape is barren and depressing. The story is well told and it moves along.  There is even a sword fight between The General and an older General.  This is a great film. On the DVD these is even an Interview with George Lucas that explains the connection between this movie and Star Wars.",1447718400,,1092,4.447236180904523

The comic relief throughout the film made you want to hate them, like then, beat them, kill them and hate them all over again As for Toshiro Misfune, wow!. WOW! WOW! WOW! He is crazy good in this role. The Princess, not so good, one personality throughout the film until the last 45 minute, then she came into character and became a person I would have wanted to see more of.
The cast was great, this is a Japanese version of Star Wars, for those who are wondering why I give high praise. The concept is there, you'll see that, but the story different then what I expected. I would purchase this film again because it was really good.",1434499200,,663,4.354838709677419
6155625,5,B00HE01030,"Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress is great fun. It is well-known to be a template for George Lucas' 1977 film A New Hope (Star Wars Episode 4), and just like that film, Hidden Fortress starts off with the unusual technique of the field of battle being described and surveyed by the lowliest of all participants - two bickering peasants from the same village who've stuck together as (failed) soldiers of fortune. On top of this major item, there are several other parallels as well - the noble general (like Obi Wan), the feisty princess (Leia) - from A New Hope, and one at the end that mirrors Darth Vader's final decision in Return Of The Jedi.

The film itself is a bit hit-and-miss, as it shows just a bit too much of the bickering Mutt and Jeff peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, especially at the beginning when their scenes go on for just a bit too long; but this is still contrasted brilliantly with horrific scenes of the aftermath of war that is really stunning to behold in terms of its brutality, filth and horror. And despite the length of some of their scenes, they do shine in their physical comedy routines, such as clambering up a slippery slope of rocky debris that keeps sliding away from them. Real Keystone Cops/Charlie Chaplin stuff here, but also with great lines/recurring motifs like ""let's stay friends in heaven too."" Funnier/lighter than a Kurosawa film has any right to be. The battle of wits between them and the noble general Makabe Rokurota, played by Kurosawa stalwart Mihune Toshiro, is always amusing - Makabe needs them as allies mainly for their labour and he plays their greed perfectly. Uehara Misa, a 19-year-old actress with gorgeous legs, is also stunning as a growling, feisty 16-year-old princess, especially in scenes when she holds off the randy peasants by snapping bushes and branches at them in a chase through the forest, and also for her whipping actions; she also has an amazing scene where she cries giant tears for literally 30 seconds in the middle of the film. Mihune's long spear duel with his adversary/ally General Hyoe Tadokoro is also a brilliant sight, especially when they tear apart curtains, the scene reminds of something from China's Three Kingdoms war epic.

The ups and downs of our team of four (later five) heroes is reminiscent of Luke and Obi-Wan's attempts to escape the Death Star and is great fun at every turn - tense and action-packed. Not a perfect film, but with plenty of great moments, many of which are unique in the Kurosawa canon. Loved it!

Not many bonus features on this one, but there's a very interesting interview with George Lucas on Kurosawa (8:10), where he mentions that the first Kurosawa film he ever saw was The Seven Samurai, and he ate Kurosawa films up after that. Lucas, a film school student, noted that Kurosawa's generation was still influenced by silent film, but that he was also a fan of John Ford, making his films more accessible to western audiences (where he was a film festival sensation), but also alienating him from Japanese audiences as being un-Japanese. This was eventually reconciled, but only after many years. Talking about Star Wars, Lucas notes how he picked up the motif of having the tale set up by the lowliest participants (droids, or peasants), but his princess is more of a stand-and-fight princess to Kurosawa's fleeing-to-safe-harbour princess; earlier drafts of the Star Wars screenplay had Leia be more like Princess Yuki, fleeing to safety, but this changed with revisions. Lucas notes that Kurosawa, in his films, tries to answer the question ""why can't people be happier, and why can't they be happier together?""

Finally, there is a pretty good theatrical trailer (3:45) that includes a few shots of Kurosawa making the film.",1434153600,,3754,4.8609375
6155626,5,B00HE01030,One of my favorite directors is Akira Kurosa.  One of my favorite actors is Toshir Mifune.  This is an unbeatable combination.  Wonderful film about a Samurai General (Mifune) protecting his princess from enemy troops.,1432166400,,218,5.352941176470588
6155627,3,B00HE01030,"This rating is not for the film but for the physical media itself. Maybe I am a bit spoiled but the first Kurosawa Criterion Collection I got was Seven Samurai and that one was a little more money, but when I got it I was floored with the packaging and the treatment it was given. So when I got this one and the packaging was just like any other Blu-Ray (albeit with incredible art work which is rare on many films), this one was a little cheaper than Seven Samurai but nowhere as cheap as a normal film so I think it is fair to expect a little bit more from the packaging on a product that has more of a premium price. I also bought Yojimbo with this and it has similar packaging so a similar review will be on it's page. So again maybe I was just spoiled with Seven Samurai as my first but that's how it goes.

The film is incredible and would be 5 out of 5 without question.",1431216000,2,877,4.040229885057471

6155635,4,B00HE01030,"We all agree that 'The Hidden Fortress' is one of our favorite Kurosawa films (if not our first choice) for various reasons you'll find in the Amazon positive reviews. A few years ago we made a trip from Connecticut to Portsmouth New Hampshire to watch it in a theater to enjoy it better on a big screen. But seeing this new Blu-ray is a revelation after owning the previous Criterion DVDs and watching a good print with an audience. This restoration is the best we'll ever see so trade in your previous editions and get this one which includes a DVD version for non Blu-ray owners and looks very good as well. In addition to the older extras there's more of the Toho series about the director's films, 'It is Wonderful to Create,' found on other Criterions and now there's an excellent commentary by Stephen Prince who has contributed other Kurosawa commentaries. Fan of these films should get his book 'The Warrior's Camera.'

However I will repeat my disappointment about Criterion's Blu-ray of another Kurosawa classic 'Throne of Blood' I reviewed on Amazon: ""My only complaint is that the subtitles on this black & white film are too often difficult to read and worse on the above mentioned extra 'It is Wonderful to Create' due their white letters not having wide enough black edges when shown over white or light grey backgrounds. I've seen worse on other films and this continuous problem makes for a frustrating viewing experience which lessened my understanding and therefore enjoyment of the story. I have complained on Criterion's website about the bad subtitling on their Blu-ray of Fritz Lang's 'M' and other Amazon customers have commented about this problem on other Criterion discs of black & white films. Why they continue to release films this way is a mystery. Don't the folks in charge see what we see at home or more likely what we can't see? This problem could have been corrected very easily or at least have the subtitles printed in easy-to-read yellow as I've seen on B&W films from other companies.""

What's the point of Criterion issuing a great restoration with new extras and us always willing to pay more for their quality discs if we can't fully enjoy them because of bad subtitling? Even a mediocre English dub would be preferable but you won't find one here. If the subtitles were easier to read, I would rate this Criterion five stars. Anyway it's a five star classic movie in any book and a must own set for fans.

Postscript 2/9/15: So far my review earned some unhelpful votes. I don't understand why anyone would think that being warned about illegible subtitling would be unhelpful unless the voter had something to do with this disc and didn't like my comments. Other than that, I praised this edition. Go figure...",1417824000,13,2756,4.773584905660377

After picking up HF and high and low, I know i'll be watching them all over again, several times.

The print is the best I have seen, and the 2k resolution is really stunning especially with the revolt of the slaves scene. With Kurosawas deep focus there are so many faces in the background, previously represented by a grey pixel or two on dvd, that now have visible expressions!!

My only thing is the translations for a lot of these movies aren't as good as the old vhs translation subtitles, imo. I would like an option of the old subs along with the new translations.",1407196800,11,834,4.374193548387097

6155644,5,B00HE01030,"One of my all-time favorite movies has finally been given the dazzling Blu-Ray treatment that it deserves. If you have yet to upgrade to Blu-Ray, then this Dual-Format edition should force your hand. Not only is the picture and audio quality spellbinding (definitely a thousand times better than the old Criterion DVD), but this disc comes with a plethora of extras that was nowhere to be found in the now expendable DVD version (except for the featurette where George Lucas talks about its influence on ""Star Wars""), including another installment of Kurosawa's delightful ""It is Wonderful to Create"" series. ""The Hidden Fortress"" has never looked better and probably never will in the future.

The movie itself remains timeless. One of Kurosawa's best and best-loved movies of his already superlative film canon, ""The Hidden Fortress"" is a grand-scale adventure that combines all the usual Kurosawa tropes: compassionate humanity, striking cinematography, superlative performances, wonderful pacing, a subversive outlook on the samurai period and, of course, riveting action. Most of all, it's funny as hell. Between the interplay from the bumbling bandits and Toshiro Mifune outwitting his foes to protect the princess, rarely have I watched a Japanese movie that has left me laughing and thoroughly entertained. After all, there's a reason why people pick ""The Hidden Fortress"" as the perfect way to start learning about Kurosawa.

I could write a half of dozen paragraphs describing the movie's greatness, but you have to watch it yourself. Don't wait. Go out and purchase this terrific Dual-Format edition of ""The Hidden Fortress"".

8631792,5,B00HE01030,"This is where George Lucas got his ideas for ""Star Wars.""  You have several cinema greats at work here. Among them: Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune.
Mifune was Clint Eastwood, Yul Brenner and Douglas Fairbanks wrapped into one unforgettable actor. Not only will his command of character amaze you, but watch how he effortlessly leaps onto horses, rides like lightning, and sweeps the princess into his saddle with a flick of his wrist. No one ever commanded the frame and performed stunts the way Mifune did.
Believe it or not, Lucas' robots R2D2 and C3P0 are in here as a supporting pair of human characters - short and tall - bickering and floundering the same way Lucas used them decades later. The story, too, is similar.
Like ""Hidden Fortress"", two other Kurosawa films were later copied by great filmmakers. ""The Seven Samurai"" became John Sturges' ""The Magnificent Seven"" featuring Yul Brenner. And ""Yojimbo"" became Sergio Leone's ""Fistful of Dollars"" with Clint Eastwood. In this way, Kurosawa is the true father of the Spaghetti Western.
If you don't mind subtitles and are looking for a great classic of Japanese cinema - this is it. If you like ""Hidden Fortress"", try some of Kurosawa and Mifune's other great films: Rashomon, Throne of Blood (Macbeth as samurai), High and Low (Macbeth meets Wall Street), Stray Dog (great cop drama) and Yojimbo.",1464739200,,1360,4.964912280701754

8631796,5,B00HE01030,"This is a very enjoyable movie from Akira Kurosawa in 1958, obviously influenced by John Ford's westerns and in turn influencing, so I'm told, ""Star Wars.""  The setting seems to be in the early 17th Century -- a combination of early firearms and body armor -- and in the aftermath of a clan war or civil war which has led to the defeat of the Yakizuki clan at the hands of the rival Yamanas.  Princess Yuki (Misa Uehara), the last of the Yakizuki royal family, has to be got to safety with a nearby friendly clan, along with her gold, by means of which she can negotiate alliances to revive her clan's fortunes.  General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune) undertakes to get her to safety, enlisting on the way the help (not totally reliable) of two peasants, Tahei (Minoru Chaiki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara), who are more interested in the gold than anything else.  The movie becomes a kind of ""road movie"" through hostile territory, with a good deal of humor, suspense, and action along the way.  The humor comes largely from the peasants, with their transparent greed (which Rokurota plays on to keep them in line) and with their squabbling with one another in a way that seems to remind one of a less gloomy Didi and Estragon -- or even R2D2 and C3PO.  They are also responsible for a good deal of physical comedy -- tumbling and sliding -- and Kurosawa takes his time in letting us see their greed and incompetence, to an extent, perhaps, that American audiences might find a bit overdone.  But the pacing is one of the features that distinguishes this movie from, say, American Westerns.  Later an important duel between Rokurota and a rival samurai -- a duel with weapons that seem half lances and half long-staffs -- is staged as a kind of formal dance, and there is too a formality in the movements and speech of the aristocratic characters that seems odd to American viewers and yet that one comes to accept as expressive of something stable and desirable in the dissolving, chaotic socio-political world that the movie shows.  The influence on ""Star Wars"" is perhaps most clearly seen in two ways -- first, in the journey through hostile territory with the Yakizuki group adopting a ""hiding in plain sight"" strategy on many occasions, and second, in the representation of the princess as an independent and capable ""strong"" female figure -- athletic, too, in a way that Carrie Fisher isn't quite!  For a long stretch of the movie, she has to pose as a mute, which is both humorous and tension-enhancing.

There are a couple of big ""set pieces"" -- the duel already mentioned, and the Fire Festival, about which I will say only that it is marvelously conceived and filmed and that, with its chant that emphasizes that life is a brief flaming-up of energy against a dark and indifferent background, seems to sum up the chaotic, violent, and dangerous world of the movie.  At a crucial later moment in the action, the aristocratic characters remember the Festival and the chant is heard again (not to give too much away).  The ending, though, is entirely satisfying.

The movie was shot for a wide screen in black-and-white, and Kurosawa's deployment of a variety of physical settings is very effective.  It's more varied than John Ford's settings tended to be, though it has some of the same effect of framing the characters against a vast, inhospitable background, but it doesn't seem as picturesque as Ford's Monument Valley can sometimes seem, perhaps because Ford tended to overuse it and because it came with a ready-made cultural value.  And the characters here seem conscious, or become conscious, of human vulnerability and frailty to an extent that the heroes of Westerns tend not to.  That's to say that the representation of masculinity is an unfamiliar one for American audiences.  Not that there's any doubt about Mifune's character's masculinity.  He is an actor made for the movies, with an unforgettable face that can assume a blend of humor, intelligence, and threat (different kinds of threat, depending on whom he's threatening!).  Uehara is a vivid princess, a formidable figure in her own right, usually carrying something that might be a springy branch but that looks and works like a whip.  She's not a cold dominatrix, though.  She gets into the Festival and she effects the rescue of  a slave girl of her clan from a life of prostitution over the objections of Rokurota.  By the end, it's clear that she fancies him . . . and who wouldn't?",1455321600,,4477,4.7844155844155845

8631798,4,B00HE01030,"I compared the 2001 Criterion edition of ""The Hidden Fortress"" with the 2014 blu-ray edition.  The picture quality of the blu-ray edition is a vast improvement with sharp, crisp, and clear images. Plus, the sound is also improved over the older release.

The subtitles of this blu-ray edition are a big disappointment. The translation is fine, but the visual aspects of the subtitles are not.

In both the 2001 and the 2014 editions, viewers are presented with subtitles that are black and white superimposed over the film's black and white picture images.  Yellow subtitles, or at least being given the option to watch the movie with yellow subtitles, would have been better and more readable.

The black and white subtitles are hard to read in many parts of the 2014 edition of the film.  In my comparison, I discovered that the 2001 edition has subtitles that are easier to read.

Yes, the 2001 subtitles are also black and white superimposed over a black and white film. But the 2001 subtitles' dialogue is composed of letters that are slightly thicker with a bolder black border around each letter.

The 2014 subtitles' dialogue is composed of letters that are thinner with a thin black border around each letter. Many of the lines of dialogue blend into the picture on the screen, making them hard to read.

In my opinion, based on watching foreign films for years, subtitles should be presented in an easy-to-read manner.  The viewer should not have to be too distracted from the action of the movie while constantly straining to read faint subtitles at the bottom of the picture image.

And for those who may not be fans of yellow subtitles, there is also the option that DVD companies can raise the widescreen picture image, making the black band at the bottom of the screen wider than the black band at the top.  Then most subtitles will fit within the larger black band at the bottom.  I own a number of foreign films where this was done and it has worked out very well.

Whatever the solution, I wish Criterion had put more effort into the presentation of the subtitles of the 2014 blu-ray edition of ""The Hidden Fortress."" It would add so much to the viewing experience of this landmark film, and there's always hope that this issue will be addressed in future editions.",1451865600,11,2283,4.732323232323233
