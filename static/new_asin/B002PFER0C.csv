3964538,1,B002PFER0C,Amazon has another Great Queen disc but it's only Volume 1 and this disc provides no information at all. Is it the entire series? Vol2?,1258329600,,135,4.44
3964539,5,B002PFER0C,"One of the best Korean historical drama I've ever seen. Just love everything and everyone in it. Mishil, played by Ko Hyun Jung was simply amazing & evil, you will really hate her there. While Princess Deokman, played by Lee Yo-Won was simply alluring, she will captivate your heart to cheer for her to beat the fierce and powerful Mishil. All the other cast were also wonderful & fantastic! You will love & hate them too. A must watch!!!",1258156800,,438,4.556962025316456
3964540,4,B002PFER0C,"Great story, plot, tempo.  Terrific group of acting talents.  Koh Hyun-Jung as Mishil should win top acting award.  She appears in episode 1-50.  That's Vol 1 and Vol 2.  The show has aired 50 episodes as of Nov. 10th, and is expected to extend to 62-70 episodes in total.

I had high hopes for the drama series to become one of the classics.  Unfortunately it falls short as the lead actress Lee Yo-Won for the role of adult Duk Man, the future Queen Seondeok, cannot act.  While great in stubborn, kind, and often times dumb contemporary female roles in her past, Lee proves to be incapable to portray Korea's first Queen, known for her outstanding wisdom which eventually provided foundation for the unification of the three Kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula in the 7th Century.

As much of the show was based upon the power matches between the two main characters Mishil and Duk Man, Lee Yo-Won's unconvincing performance as Duk Man was a stark contrast to Koh Hyun-Jung's brilliant portrayal of the charismatic, powerful Mishil.  While in the story Duk Man wins in the end, Lee's Duk Man is decidedly not a worthy opponent of Koh's Mishil.  Pretending to believe Lee's Duk Man as someone she isn't through this LONG series is exhausting, taking away quite a bit of the excitement and pleasures from the stories and other actors' great acting...

The show enjoys immense popularity in Korea.  Despite the tiresome Lee Yo-Won, the show is otherwise excellent, and has plenty to offer.  I wouldn't miss the fantastic Koh Hyun-Jung for the world.  So for those who wouldn't mind a BAD lead actress, go for it.",1257811200,,1609,4.758122743682311

The woman who plays her Go Hyun Jung is so amazing, she plays the villainess to perfection. Really worth watching and entertaining. Looking forward to watching the next Volume.

I have been watching Japanese, Chinese, and lately Korean historical dramas since I moved here to Santa Clara, CA twenty years ago. This is the first one I have ever bought.

3964550,5,B002PFER0C,"This is volume 1 of a 3 volume dvd set of the TV series airing in 2009-2010 in the US. This is a top quality south korean tv drama which is receiving rave reviews globally. This month (dec '09), Volume 2 of  this set has just come out... As soon as Vol 3 comes out I'm getting it too!

This story is extremely addictive! - I warn you it will make you stay up till the wee hours if you are not extremely disciplined. At time of this writing the US broadcast of the weekly series is probably somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd volume. I bought the 1st volume because I missed the earlier episodes, and because it's well worth owning and sharing with your family. As with other MBC, KBS or SBS historical korean dramas of this decade, this video set is clearly and expertly translated with english subtitling (including all idioms and colloquialisms to english equivalents). Compared to american tv historical dramas, this as with similar kdramas is more addicting, higher production quality, more accurate  historical period recreation, and MUCH longer lasting enjoyment. Plenty of eye candy of all types, characters with depth, intellgent script, interwoven plot lines, cliffhangers, martial arts fights and wars (not gross), political intrigue (not dry), family and romance themes, country and individual economic struggles, etc.

Yes, as with american dramas, these script writers take many liberties with the historical true story in order to flesh out historical gaps and to make a riveting plot line - and they succeed - it's such a great story we really don't care - we just enjoy the story... and then many non-korean viewers get very interested to learn about the actual history behind the fictional drama! So we learn the real history one way or the other.) It has overall excellent production, costuming, historical period re-creation, video quality (not HD or blu-ray but with excellent quality flatpanel tv, dvd player and a monster ultra  hdmi cable (yes, brand DOES make a difference - you get what you pay for in signal quality), this dvd set is equivalent in video clarity, color depth, etc., to my blu-ray discs).

Thoughts on k-dramas in general (some US amazon customers may be unfamiliar with this genre):

I find that the good kdramas are well worth watching - and worth owning, too. And others who would ordinarily not be interested in foreign video and not have any desire to watch subtitled foreign dramas find themselves hooked after 1 or 2 episodes... what's more, people find that typically women, men and kids all enjoy these - especially the historical dramas, which are very relevant human stories... These are not ""chick flicks"", they are designed as intelligent family entertainment.

Other historical drama greats are Dae Jang Geum (the one most people new to kdramas start on), Hae Shin ('Emperor of the Sea' about Jang Bo Go), Admiral Yi Sun Shin (famous humane leader and military strategist that saved korea from two samurai invasions in the late 1500's; military historians study his activities today, many judge him as better than Lord Nelson), Sangdo (The Way of Trade), Hur Jun (famous historical doctor), Damo (female policewoman), etc. Many of these are available in Region 1 for the US market. You can often get them at amazon... if not, then look at hanbooks or yesasia.

This addiction got me to get a second dvd player for playing all region dvd's, and it was well worth it - besides, it's good to have a backup. The one I have I got at amazon (search ""multi region dvd player""). It's a great player and does everything - and more - see my review on it (Pioneer Dv610av-s Silver Multi Region Code Free Hdmi 1080p Upconverting DVD Player with SACD and DVD-Audio Playback). Has various type output connectors. Plays my european and asian movie DVD's just fine, and of course all american DVD's as well. Also plays CD's and has other neat features. Bookmarks the location of where I stopped at, too. Most foreign movies and tv dramas are not yet coming out on blu-ray, though that will probably change soon... so far, blu-ray capable multi-region dvd players are WAY overpriced, but perhaps that too, will change soon. Not necessary to have blu-ray for very fine video playback quality on regular DVDs, if you have high quality video equipment.

Postscript to my comments on this video set:
  1). One nit: One disc, one spot on my Volume 1 set, during episode 2 got stuck partway through, but it was fine at the next episode, and everything else played fine on this set of the first 20 episodes. This hangup happened at exactly the same spot on the disc on both my Pioneer and my Samsung excellent DVD players, so something was wrong with the disc burn there, I guess. But I'm so happy with the entire set of DVD's and these are not always easy to get (since not everyone sells them and they go out of print after a year or so, with english subtitling), that I will overlook it just this once (if it happened more, I'd send the set back for a swap copy). I didn't miss out on key parts of the story, and if I was curious I'd go online to see the tidbit I missed... but it wasn't in a key part anyway.

  2). WOW I've been watching Queen Seondeok Volume 1 dvd set and it's a very high quality video, visually, when you watch it using high quality equipment. WOW it really pops!! - seems like the filmmakers really made this a high-quality film, technically. I'm wowed by it, can't say it enough. The video and sound quality of these discs, using my multi region Pioneer DV-610AV- player is really fantastic! Surprisingly, it's equal to the visual and sound quality played with blu-ray discs, using my high-quality top chip blu-ray (or upconverting for regular DVD's) player, displayed over quality monster HDMI cable to my Kuro Elite plasma tv. I watched same Queen Seondeok disc on both. All the eye candy costumes, indoor and outdoor scenery (day and night) etc. really pop in color richness and visual detail, down to hair, sweat, whiskers, various skin tones, various textures and the costume and set details. So in terms of visual & sound quality, using a quality upconverting 1080 DVD player, quality HDMI cable and fine TV, this DVD set really really delivers!

Comments on kdramas generally, relevant for this Queen Seondeok set and others, for US & western audiences:

Many of the kdramas can be found online for free if you can stand low picture quality and watching an hour at a time on a pc, which I hate. Top-rated kdrama stories such as this one are so well made that it's really really worth watching them on your nice big TV at home. Try it - it's amazing how dim and flat and awful the online version is compared to getting it on broadcast TV or on DVDs. If you get them on disc, be sure to avoid formats that are not actually DVD - the other formats are not fine video quality, but cheap recordings of originals... you may save money but for non dvd quality you might as well watch on the pc... i.e., don't bother. You can usually purchase them new from amazon, amazon marketplace (e.g. videocity), or hanbooks or yesasia; note many of the english-subtitled ones (except for Dae Jang Geum) go out of print after a year or so and become hard or impossible to find. Sometimes you can rent the dvds for cheap at korean-owned markets that rent movie discs as part of their business - but make sure these have subtitles! Most of the clientele of these stores are native korean speakers so often their dvds don't include the subtitling.

Kdramas are done both as historical dramas, and as modern dramas and soaps. But even the soaps are better than american soaps - even people who hate american soaps can enjoy some kdrama soaps.

Hopefully the american makers will eventually learn something from this.

Why the local or national nonprofit stations in the US haven't glommed onto these videos is a mystery... Not everyone in the US has access to the broadcast channels that play the historical or modern kdramas.

Why South Korea on the whole doesn't market these products more actively, effectively and widely to western audiences, we don't know either. Electronics and cars are not the only quality export products of south korea. These video dramas are an export market in themselves that have growth potential; as they are popular globally, they have already generated an increase in world tourism to korea and its historical sites. The US has a number of k-drama fan clubs (chicago, philadelphia, california) and scattered fans around the country, and you can find their websites online. The korean tv networks have on occasion attempted to tap into the US interest, but not in any effective way nor with any effective followup... Guess they think we are at heart ignorant barbarians. All that does is perpetuate the non-awareness.

Yet, these shows are a great way to stimulate an interest or at least awareness of korean culture, both modern and historical (even if the historical dramas are heavily fictionalized versions)... Pre-western Korean history is not usually taught as part of world history in the US school system, in spite of the rich melting pot that makes up the US population... Most americans are woefully ignorant of non-european, non-american world history. This is a rich lode to tap for great story-making, at the very least, if not also cross-cultural interest.

More frustratingly, some fine historical kdramas are not fully translated - apparently the makers didn't feel it worth the investment to subtitle the complete story for western audiences... (but since they don't market their products effectively to western audiences they are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy!). For example, the western version of Admiral Yi Sun Shin is a smaller DVD set than the original - they only translated the strategic, political and military story parts and not the other human interest parts of the story into english. They did a very good job of selection/cut-down here, so that the subtitled set of discs views as a complete and excellent, and extremely captivating story - - but, we all wonder what juicy bits of the story we are missing out on. Imagine if a story of Lord Nelson, General Lee or Grant, George Washington, or other western notable chopped out a lot of their  personal life?  We'd all like to enjoy that part of the story, too - whether fictionalized gap-filling, or based on true events. And some great dramas aren't translated at all into english. Furthermore, there are many fine fictional and historical books that these kdramas are based on which are NOT translated into english. There's probably more chinese and japanese and indian works translated into english than south korean. C'mon, guys! Get with the times!! There's export money to be made here, and making the world aware of your country's cultural richness!  Stop sticking your head in the sand!",1261958400,18,10849,4.791332263242376
3964551,5,B002PFER0C,"The above reviewer put bad review out of ignorance, which is bad ethics on the marketplace.

In reality, this is volume 1 of a 3 volume dvd set of the TV series airing in 2009-2010 in the US. This is a top quality south korean tv drama which is receiving rave reviews globally.

Note that this volume one seems to have two amazon pages - with different sellers. One webpage at amazon lists it for $35, a very good deal, sold by videocity. The other webpage at amazon currently lists 5 different sellers - it ranges from $50 to the more average price of $69. For the other page for the Vol 1 listed at around $50, where I'll post this review as well, go to /Great-Queen-Seondeok-Vol/dp/B002PFER0C/ref=pd_cp_d_0  at amazon.

In this particular drama, the character of Misil (a key opponent) is amazingly well played - her body language, subtleties of face and voice, the script lines, etc. - what an amazing persona and intelligence the actress, script, and director created together! Kudos, I hope she wins awards. Wonder what other kinds of roles she can play? And I say that of a drama where everyone else is a good actor, too.

My only story criticism so far is minor: I do wish they'd done a better job with the character of Kim Yusin - I am up to episode 50 on TV. I read online that he was one heck of a great general, so in real history, he must have been even a smarter and more dynamic and involved character than he is being portrayed in this drama (probably to make the heroine look smarter?). But even so, in this story, he's a likable character and good hero.

Postscripts to my comments on this video set:
  1). I noticed that there seems to be two versions of this product. This one is listed as put out by Insta Entertainment, and has a blue background cover. The other one is listed as put out by MBC, and has a green background cover. I actually bought the green background cover version of Vol 1, so far. So my review in terms of video/disc quality is for that version and Vol 1 set only; I cannot speak to whether or not this one is precisely the same. (But I would guess that this Insta Entertainment version is authorized by the original publisher MBC who created this drama, or it wouldn't be sold here on amazon (this ain't no ebay! :) This version is more competitively priced, so it's worth consideration.

  2) One nit: One disc, one spot on my  Volume 1 set (I have the green cover Vol 1 set by MBC - not this red cover Vol 1 set by Insta Entertainment), during episode 2 got stuck partway through, but it was fine at the next episode, and everything else played fine on this set of the first 20 episodes. This hangup happened at exactly the same spot on the disc on both my Pioneer and my Samsung excellent DVD players, so something was wrong with the disc burn there, I guess. But I'm so happy with the entire set of DVD's and these are not always easy to get (since not everyone sells them and they go out of print after a year or so, with english subtitling), that I will overlook it just this once (if it happened more, I'd send the set back for a swap copy). I didn't miss out on key parts of the story, and if I was curious I'd go online to see the tidbit I missed... but it wasn't in a key part anyway.

  3). WOW I've watched the entire Queen Seondeok Volume 1 dvd set (green cover) now, and it's a very high quality video, visually, when you watch it using high quality equipment. WOW it really pops!! - seems like the filmmakers really made this a high-quality film, technically. I'm wowed by it, can't say it enough.

All the eye candy costumes, indoor and outdoor scenery (day and night) etc. really pop in color richness and visual detail, down to hair, sweat, whiskers, various skin tones, various textures, and all the costume and set details. So in terms of visual & sound quality, using a quality upconverting 1080 DVD player, quality HDMI cable and fine TV, this DVD set really really delivers!

The only problem I had with the discs was what one reviewer stated, that disc one got stuck part way through episode two, and all the rest of the discs played fine. A few months ago I sat down to watch the series again and now almost every disc will not play past the half way point! I have A LOT of DVDs and this has never happened. But there is good news! The entire series is available in a boxed set from Yesasia.com. It is the Korean release with English subtitles (which are pretty good)and is on sale for $230. I've only watched two discs so far but have had no problems. Apparently MBC Korea has something that MBC America does not... quality control! Almost forgot, there are extras on these discs (no subtitles) that include interviews, photo shoots and outtakes. UPDATE I finally got through the entire set and had no problem with any disc.",1334361600,5,900,4.395209580838324
8376977,2,B002PFER0C,"Queen Seon Deok is a captivating historical drama. The quality of MBC America's box sets is lacking though. Be sure to check the bottoms of your discs once you receive because many are filled with scratches. Boxes 2 and 3 have discs laying on top of each other in a digipak case, and these discs come out of their holders during shipment and end up rolling around in the box. Box 1 has plastic clips on the sides that hold the discs in place, and there are scratches on the bottom because of that. So be sure you are able to play your discs before the return period is up. I had to get a replacement 2-3 times. Also the info on Amazon should be updated, these only have English subtitles (no Spanish).

I guess MBC doesn't care about the quality of their items for Region 1. The packaging looks pretty, but it does not serve the basic function of holding all discs safely. The Korean Region 3 release has normal DVD cases like movies and I doubt they give those local customers scratched up DVDs. 5 stars for the show itself, a generous 2 stars for these box sets... I ended up ordering the Region 3 set from Korea and will eventually sell off the ones from MBC America. You even get a bonus disc in the R3 Korean set with extras like outtakes, etc...which are always fun to watch.",1332374400,3,1281,4.3153526970954355
8376978,5,B002PFER0C,This was fun to watch. I had to get the other seasons and it was hard to wait for the other two seasons to arrive. Now my son has borrowed by set to watch it.,1332028800,,158,3.5428571428571427
8376979,4,B002PFER0C,"I won't get into how great this series is as others have already done a fine job of that. I'll just say that after watching 20 episodes online I already decided I had to own the DVDs. Quite unlike other Korean period dramas, Queen Seon Duk, for a while, was like one long movie. And it was great. But then the first of a few lulls arrived and the series entered into soap opera mode killing its momentum. Fortunately the lulls don't last that long, but they are there. And I hate to say it but I don't feel the story did enough to justify why the hero of the show... should be the hero. That aside, this is easily my second favorite Korean period drama.

Now, as for the DVD's themselves. I was expecting them to be at least the same quality of Yes Asia Entertainment releases, especially considering their absurdly high price tag. But these official MBC discs fall somewhere between the Yes Asia quality standard and that of the cheap Hong Kong releases. What I noticed at first was the thin boxes. They didn't feel sturdy like YA Entertainment releases. They're thin and soft and kinda flimsy. I bought all three volumes and one box was dented, one plastic tray cracked and 2 discs were loose in the packaging. So far they play fine, but still, it's pretty annoying to dish out a hundred dollars and find that MBC is trying to save money by cramming as many discs as they can into one box.

The picture quality is not horrible (most of the time), but it's far from good. Or, again, far from being worth the price you have to pay. At times the image is grossly over-sharpened and hard to watch. This happens especially during interior scenes. A clearly visible ""halo"" is apparent along any edge in the picture. They went way overboard with trying to make the show look better that they wound up ruining it.

Some discs hold 2 episodes, but most hold 3 and it's then that the video compression really shows. Slow movement looks fine, but when things pick up with the fighting and battle scenes you clearly see grossly apparent pixelation and compression. I almost felt like I was back to watching them online again.

The DVD menu is annoying and unfriendly. Each screen takes too long to fade in. The menu doesn't tell you what episodes are on the disc. It just shows you the first episode broken up into 4 chapters. You need to click, click, click through a lot of ""Next"" buttons to get to the next episode. There are interlacing problems as the menu flicks up and down one pixel when you press buttons. For some reason the opening theme is only shown once at the front of each disc, and sometimes not at all. The closing credits aren't usually shown till the end of the last episode on the disc. Between each episode (in lieu of the opening theme) is a screen shot with the episode number. And this is kinda funny: it's in the ""STAR WARS"" font. If that weren't inappropriate enough, the font is also hard to read when numbers are shown. Nines look like zeroes and such.

Bottom line: great show. These MBC discs are far from high quality, but they are the best versions you'll be able to get unfortunately.",1308355200,,3108,4.45518453427065
8376980,1,B002PFER0C,"I began watching this by accident on a local foreign language TV station and became hooked. This costume drama series has it all. Full of action, drama, struggle, star crossed lovers, villians, plucky comic relief characters, and a little bad acting. The struggle between the two strong central women characters; One young and one old, one royal and one not, one idealistic and the other pragmatic and powerful, drive the series. Even after the older one dies her actions continue to echo through the story line through the actions of the surviving characters.

I'm totally unfamiliar with Korean TV, so I don't know if this production is typical or not. It is a really interesting story once you get all the characters straight. There are a lot of characters and the social and familial relationships are very intertwined. There are many plot twists. Some of them look improbable and created to just to fix story lines that got out of control. And you pick up a little bit about Korean culture of this ""medieval"" era and it's relationship to the rest of the world at that time.

Occasionally, there are some wordy and philosphical parts I feel must have some tie in to current issues in Korea and Asia that are passing by me. But that is ok. Also, some of the drama is slow paced and drawn out in comparison to most stories I am used to for TV. But you get hooked on seeing the characters develop and change over time. Both the heroes and villians have many dimensions.

It's very, very different from American TV. The episodes are a full hour long each and and the series itself is very long, three volumes. The most interesting character doesn't even show up until the second volume! I bought the DVDs because there was just no other way for me to get through it all.

This addictive series is really an escape into a completely different world.

ADD ON WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Change from 5 to 1 star. Very dissapointed in volune 1 disks.

I still rate the series highly, but the product I have from MBC America is labled region 1,4 with release date September 2009 English subtitles. It appears to be genuine product. Also, the runing time is 1400 minutes, so I think there is an error in the product listing details on Amazon for that.

The DVD's are locking up, skipping, defective and impossible to watch with enjoyment. Extremely poor quality control by MBC America. These are systemic and repeatable errors, indicating they prepared data wrongly for writing to the disks or used a corrupted file. MBC America apparently has no quality assurance department to check master file before manufacturing disks. Supposedly this was a huge hit series in Korea and I guess they wanted to get the DVDs out fast. But it is inexcusable for for the MBC to ever ship item of such poor quality for export. What a bunch of amateurs!!! If their defective sets were recalled, they missed the one I got. So buying something labled MBC America product is  no guarantee of functionality.

I bought volume 1 from another vendor locally, so I am out of luck as far as replacement. If you can get a guaranteed functional set, go for it, as the series is very enjoyable.

I am not sure what region 1 set is ok, as mine looks identical to this listing. The only difference I can see is there are  no Spanish subtitles as listed in the amazon product details on the volume 1 set I have purchased.",1303862400,3,3382,4.62771285475793
