8617346,4,B000TXNDOI,"""Una Cancin a la Virgen"" is strictly for those who believe in miracles and/or want to hear Luis Aguilar and Rosita Quintana sing - which for many of us is enough to pass an hour or so. Although it is marketed under the umbrella of ""La Coleccin Ranchera"" this is not a ranchera movie, but a very urban melodrama involving theater performers who, sometimes, sing rancheras. The script was already well-worn when the movie was released in 1949, and the formula has been used many times since. That being said, the theatrical numbers keep it moving at a fast pace, which the good quality of the print, both in image and audio, make it easy to enjoy. Don't expect much from the dramatics, just enjoy the entertainment.",1361491200,2,713,4.622047244094488
