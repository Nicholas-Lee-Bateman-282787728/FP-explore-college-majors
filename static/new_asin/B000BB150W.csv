2409591,2,B000BB150W,"Eric Idle is not the problem here.  By the time he's been on stage for a minute and a half, he's convinced us that he has the chops to handle the singing, the dancing, and the comedic attitude to make classic Gilbert and Sullivan work delightfully.  He does the best he can in the middle of this very bad idea of taking the Mikado out of its native setting in a comic-opera Japan and putting it in -- really? -- purportedly an English seaside resort village.  There's no good reason to do this.  Let me repeat that:  There is no good reason to do this, and there is never so much as a pretense of an attempt to convince the viewer that there ever was a good reason to do this.  Compounding the error, the artistic designer seems to have gone to great lengths to be sure the result is extremely unfortunate.  The makeup is garish and the posturing of the individual members of the chorus -- I don't blame them personally any more than I blame Eric Idle -- runs the gamut from distracting to repulsive.  The dancing of the chorus line, dressed as bellboys and maids, is frenetic, intrusive, and all over the map stylistically yet relentlessly unsuited to the music or the setting.  I won't even describe how ill-conceived and ham-handed the direction for television is.  If the makeup weren't so hideous, the serial close-ups might not seem like such a bad idea.

The singing is excellent from all the lead characters, but the look of this thing is an utter failure.  The best way to watch it is with your eyes closed.",1439856000,,1516,4.452898550724638

2409611,4,B000BB150W,"I have always liked this version.  It underscores the fact that there really isn't anything inherently Japanese about the Mikado.  Eric's rendition of the Lord High Executioner is brilliant with some excellent ad-libbing.  Almost overshadowing his performance is the narcissistic future daughter-in-law who absolutely drips of self-importance.

The sets were simple and lent themselves well to the television audience.  The camerawork was decent.  The video quality could have been better, but this was a live performance, and there are some compromises that happen there.  The only complaint I would have is the audio needed a bit more cleaning up because the first couple of numbers it was very difficult to decipher what was being sung when a larger number of performers were involved.  This may have been a case of the sound tech getting used to how things were sounding on the fly and the quality did seem to improve later on.

All and all, this is an enjoyable performance, and I hope it gets re-released with some work on the audio.",1402272000,,1039,4.994186046511628

2409613,5,B000BB150W,"it is strange to see the Mikado in 1920s western garb, but as the director says it always about England, not Japan.  The players were wonderful especially Yum yum and Kittishaw (sp?).  Eric Idle as Koko was surprisingly good.  Of course Pooh Bah steals the show.",1397347200,,262,4.6521739130434785
2409614,4,B000BB150W,"Like Richard Wagner, W.S Gilbert took great pains in the design of the sets for his works.  The visual design of the Mikado was inspired by an exhibition of Japanese culture Gilbert saw in London.  The director of this production has transferred the setting to a posh British resort hotel of the 1920's; there is no observable reason for this choice and it certainly does not enhance the experience.  That said, the musical end of the production is very good, including the performance of Eric Idle of Monty Python.  One of the Three Little Maids appears to be Sandra Bullock's mother.
All told, recommended, but the director's design choices are a distraction.",1393113600,,661,4.875
2409615,1,B000BB150W,"This is a very entertaining and enjoyable opera.  It's survived for over 100 years, and it will surely go on being produced for years to come, but in spite of this version rather than because of it.  The changes in set and costume, hammy acting and poor direction make this a lesser production.  In addition the poor sound and video quality make this DVD a chore to watch.  Even fans of this play will be hard pressed to enjoy this production.",1391904000,,443,4.432098765432099
2409616,3,B000BB150W,"I thought this performance was well sung but I was unsettled by the staging and costumes.  i didn't fully realize that this was totally restaged when i ordered it.  The director, Jonathan Miller, said that the operetta is so very ""English"" that he felt it should be staged at a 1920's English seaside resort.  It worked to an extent; the tapdancing was a bit startling at first until I remembered it was set in the '20's.  But there are enough references to Japan that Miller could not make disappear, e.g. the music for the entrance of the Mikado and several verbal references to Japan and Titti-Pu that I began to long for the familiar kimonos and black wigs.  Eric Idle was very funny but surely he could have been just as funny in Japanese costume.  In sum, if your first concern is for the musical performance you probably won't see any incongruencies in the staging.  But if you want the staging to fit the music I would say look for a more traditional performance.",1390003200,,971,4.545977011494253
2409617,5,B000BB150W,"This rendition of Mikado,  in the costumes and mannerisms of a seaside luxury resort in the 1920's,  is superbly ridiculous.  Eric Idle is an unforgettable Nanki Poo.  And because it's the English National Opera,  the singing and playing of the music is first rate.  Not to mention the acting of all the principles.  All around greatness.",1385424000,,338,4.928571428571429
2409618,5,B000BB150W,".....except perhaps for the setting, which is a large fashionable hotel, at a seaside resort in Japan, in the 1920's. Don't be dismayed however, once the first notes sound, you will be swept away by all that is The Mikado and this engaging, imaginative and novel staging. The cast and orchestra are simply superb, every word is clearly enunciated every note is true. There are outstanding performances by all the principals, particularly, Leslie Garret as Yum Yum, Bonnaventure Bottone as Nanki- Poo, Richard Van Allen as Pooh-Bah, Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush and last, but by no means the least a superlative Katisha, performed by Felicity Palmer. Eric Idle might be gently criticized by purists for becoming, briefly, a little pythonesque in a couple of scenes, but is otherwise flawless as Koko.  Koko's patter song is humorously updated, much to the delight of the English audience.  Finally Richard Angus is the very model of a modernized Mikado! The staging and the costumes, all in monochrome, are certainly a contrast to the usual multi colored Kimonos and Robes and the highly decorated back drops we are used to seeing, but they work extraordinarily well. I think I may have detected one or two minor omissions in the libretto [Mia Culpa WSG].  If you are a Savoyard [or even if you are not] I urge you to delight yourself by watching this production",1383177600,,1361,4.908695652173913

2409655,4,B000BB150W,"Great performance once you get past the the first few scenes. Annoying is the camera close ups of some particularly ugly, and somewhat out of sync, men during ""Do you want to know who we are"". Followed by the unnecessary fake entrance of Mr. Idle in tennis togs and the first rather uncertain notes out of his mouth. He redeems himself in a very funny ""I've got a little list"" and the rest of his vocals are quite good, if not operatic in quality. But then Koko is the comic and doesn't really need to be a good singer. The rest of the cast more than makes up for it with very good voices.

After the shaky opening scenes things settle down and this version becomes my favorite out of all the versions I have.  (I'm a G&S groupie :) ) As for the lack of Japanese costumes... If you rip the audio to an MP3 as I do, so you can have your G&S when exercising, and listen without watching you will understand that the costuming is just a diversion. Ignore the ""non-Japanese"" surroundings and let the music stand on its own. You will not be disappointed.

The ""making of"" extra is worth watching to see what went into the production, including why they decided to pass on the Japanese trappings. Fascinating.",1287273600,,1203,4.385650224215246

2409658,4,B000BB150W,"I wish Amazon had a system of fractional rating. I would give this a 4.5, with 4.4 going to all that went into the creation of this particular Katisha. Felicity Palmer sings the role beautifully - her voice is a different category/league to those of all the other principals. She acts brilliantly and hats off to the costume designer and tailors. Katisha is a woman with a very elegant and expensive wardrobe, only slightly over the top. This is not a grotesque Katisha, but a plain woman determined to get her man. She even has a unrequited admirer in her train.

Eric Idle is fun, though he can't really sing. He moves beautifully and though some gags fall flat, his sense of comic timing is superb.

I prefer traditional productions and colourful sets and costumes. Yet, though this production is intentionally non-traditional and the colour palate is white/black/grey/navy blue, it works well.",1273968000,,897,4.894736842105263

This new DVD is obviously much clearer and makes it even better then before. The singing is excellent and Eric Idle holds his end against the professional singers and is a terrific Ko-Ko. The whole cast is very good and the Mikado is very good entertainment. First class in fact. The extra section on 'The Making of the Mikado"" is fascinating as it shows the cast as they are in real life and they are almost unrecognisable without the make-up.

2409673,1,B000BB150W,"Poor Gilbert! He must have turned over in his grave every day since this monstrosity was created.

Removing the opera from Japan and dressing the characters in British 1920s formal attire takes Mikado out of context, and renders it humorless and senseless.

Gilbert was a genius. The creator of this perversion is not!",1227916800,,318,4.981132075471698
2409674,5,B000BB150W,"I'm always leery of ""new and improved"" productions of the works of Gilbert & Sullivan.  The originals are hard to beat.  To my amazement, this version of The Mikado is actually very watchable and enjoyable!  The producers stayed true, for the most part, to both the original story line and libretti (other than the fact they ""moved"" the story from Japan to England, and made a few very minor changes to the dialog).  The performance of the musical score is outstanding - Sullivan would be proud.",1219363200,,495,4.72093023255814
2409675,4,B000BB150W,"""The Mikado"" is arguably the most-performed of all the G&S operas. The current stage director of the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Austin and renowned G&S scholar Ralph MacPhail said that not a day goes without the Mikado being performed somewhere in the world. I don't know if that's true, but ""Mikado"" is without question a very popular and frequently-performed comic opera. In addition, there are many different takes on it. There's Red Mikado, Hot Mikado, Swing Mikado, and recently the Mikado Project.

This version, with Monty Python's Eric Idle as Ko-Ko, is set in a seaside resort in the 1920s. (For those of you not familiar with the plot of Mikado, see my comment for a link to the G&S archives, as they summarize it far better than I could.) The setting, a 20s resort instead of ancient Japan, works surprisingly well. The costumes are enjoyable to watch, though I thought they went a bit heavy on the makeup for a filmed version. The highlight of the show is clearly Eric as Ko-Ko. His presence injects life into the show. Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum do an adequate job, though I didn't think they particularly had a lot of presence. Katisha and the Mikado are both excellent.

I think producing it as a movie, rather than filming one of the stage performances, works against it somewhat. For it to work as a movie, the screenplay would have to have been considerably revised, which it wasn't, and so it never escapes its stage roots. As the Mikado says, ""virtue is triumphant only in theatrical performances."" Beyond that, my only major complaint was that in the Act I finale, the tap-dancing of the chorus drowns out the principals. Overall, however, this is an enjoyable production of one of the greatest comic operas ever written, and belongs on the shelf of every G&S fan.",1216339200,,1783,4.748387096774193
2409676,3,B000BB150W,"Director Jonathan Miller is normally an intelligent and resourceful stage director, as some of his witty comments even here on the making of this largely blighted production suggest. In the present case, sadly, he has fallen victim to a widespread delusion among contemporary opera and theater directors about the nature of how to please their audiences. He remarks that since we've by now ALL seen various productions of ""The Mikado"" set in the original Japan, the times cry out for a version that's radically different. Neglected in this view is the fact that in the audience of any production of even so familiar a work there will be a significant number of people who've never seen it before. For their sake, if it's still stageworthy, it deserves to be presented without being maimed by a ""bright"" idea. Miller, though, has presumably thought it wiser to cater instead to those sated members of the potential audience who'd be bored by straightforward Gilbert and Sullivan. If, however, such is his judgment, why do a new production of ""The Mikado"" at all? If this masterpiece of comic opera can no longer hold the stage as written, why not let it slip quietly into oblivion? Having chosen to set the work in the England of the 20's and 30's of the last century, Miller ignores so many consequent absurdities that he unwittingly invites viewers to question whether he's done more than just maim G&S. Signs saying ""No Flirting,"" which might make sense in the repressive Victorian England which lies just beneath the surface of the original ""Japan,"" seem pointless in a roaring 20's hotel. More seriously, ""Japanese"" concerns with beheadings and the presence of a Mikado have no pertinence at an English seaside resort. And just how the work has been made meaningful much less been improved by early 30's cinematic references and dance routines remains problematic at best. Miller, in sad allegiance to our current conformist tradition of arbitrary ""innovation,"" emerges here as a director who could himself benefit from having a director with the foresight to nix such ""bright"" ideas in future.

The three stars here are for the singers from the English National Opera, all of whom manage through fine voices to transcend the dull and ugly irrationality which has replaced the fun and high spirits of the original

DVD EXTRAS:
""A Source of Innocent Merriment: The Making of the Mikado""; downloadable libretto in PDF format; thumbnail cast biographies; menu and scene selection.

TEXT:
The spoken dialogue is generally faithful to the version Gilbert wrote, despite a couple of pointless omissions and gratuitous additions.  The usual silly updatings have been made to Ko-Ko's ""list"" and the Mikado's ""punishments"" song.  As usual the changes add nothing to the show.  The overture is truncated to a little over two minutes.

SETS:
At the beginning of Act 1, a card appears on the screen to inform the audience that the show takes place at a seaside off the coast of Japan.  It appears to be quite some distance from Japan, perhaps near the Isle of Wight, for the scene appears to be the main lobby of a large, mostly white-painted, very snooty, Edwardian hotel that is jammed full with English luminaries.

COSTUMES:
The overall production design is consistently black and white with some dark gray.  Even the makeup tends toward very pale.  The production has been yanked out of medieval Japan and plunked down in the late 1920s or early 1930s, sometimes making absolute nonsense out of the spoken lines.  Whether inappropriate or not, the costumes range from formal to sporting and are handsome and elegant.

TELEVISION IMAGERY:
The television director, John Michael Phillips seems to be an incompetent or a fool or perhaps both.  He clearly feels that he is required to ""improve"" on a mere stage piece by nervous cutting, irrelevant camera angles and superimposed images.  Each of his directorial touches interrupts the flow  of  the show and is progressively more and more annoying.  Throughout the DVD, there is a subtle hint of fogginess that reminds me of the Vaseline-on-the-lens close-ups of Doris Day in her old films with Rock Hudson.

SOUND:
Dolby digital stereo without any particular bells and whistles.

COMMENTARY:
This is an example, albeit mostly benign, of ""Regietheater,"" so-called ""director-theater.""  The director, Jonathan Miller, appears on the accompanying ""making-of"" piece, carefully explaining that author W. S. Gilbert got it wrong and that a hundred years of doing the show his way has been a fluke.  At last the genius of Jonathan Miller has penetrated to the truth about ""The Mikado:"" it is NOT about the Japanese, but about the English.  When I heard that, my reaction was, ""Big whoop, Jonathan!""  It is nice to discover that even such a close-minded creature as a famous and revered stage director can eventually work his way to what has been painfully bleeding obvious to audiences all over the world since the show opened on  March 14, 1885.

In accordance with his great revelation, Miller has thrown overboard all the Japanese trappings in favor of ultra-posh, 1930-ish Englishness.  Miller was so hyped up on this notion that he spent great effort in duplicating the accents found in early English sound films.  (In the making-of feature, there is a scene right out of the old movie musical ""42nd Street"" during which Miller attempts to get his leading soprano to say ""wuhlld"" rather than ""world.""  Just like Ruby Keeler, more than fifty years before, she repeats the line over and over without discernable change.)  Miller is obviously quite indifferent to the fact that his re-setting of the show makes absolute hash out of the plain meaning of many of the lines, whatever the accent in which they are spoken.

Having now vented on the directorial concept, I must report that the performance is a good one in spite of Millers' brainstorm.  The sets and costumes look good, the performers range from more-than-adequate to excellent.  Eric Idle is the name star of the show and he is fine as Ko-Ko the upstart former cheap tailor who has been promoted to chief man of his town.  (For hard core G&S fans, I must amplify that by adding that while very good, he is no better than such historic Ko-Kos as Henry Lytton, Martyn Green or even John Reed.)  Felicity Palmer is a very good Katisha, although, I think, directed to make her voice too harsh from time to time, but she is made up and costumed in far too glamorous a fashion for a love-sick maiden reduced to boasting about the loveliness of her elbow and despairing of finding a new victim ... ahem, lover.  Bonaventura Bottone is a surprisingly fine G&S tenor, in some ways the real ""find"" of the show.  Mark Richardson offers an unusually strong Pish-Tush, even if he is a bit over-parted with the basso-profundo depths required in Act 2.  Richard Van Allan is OK as Poo-Bah, but I have the distinct impression that he would be much better with more experience in the role.  Richard Angas in an astonishing costume, is visually impressive as The Mikado but not a great deal more.  Garrett, Bullock and Robinson are fine as the three little maids, although hardly memorable.

The male choristers are made up to look like famous individuals of the 1920s.  This is amusing at first, but it quickly becomes a nuisance.  After all, if Lytton-Strachey and Noel Coward are there, why won't they step forward and say something witty?

This is a production with grievous faults for a knowledgeable G&S fan.  Those faults, however, are not of such nature as to bother the great majority of viewers who simply want a good-looking, funny, well-sung version of a show that has plenty of good music and laughs.

Four stars, for not even Miller can stifle a perpetual source of ""innocent merriment.""",1196467200,,6377,4.982986767485822
2409686,3,B000BB150W,"While this production was interestingly staged and seriously fun to watch, (it takes Eric Idle to remind us that ""Oh bother the flowers of spring"" is a euphemism for ""Oh buggar the flowers...""), I suspect I am just too much of a purist to be wholly comfortable with this ""Mikado"".  When I visit Titipu Japan, I expect to see a chorus of samurai at the beginning, rather than a group of seedy-looking Englishmen Making creepy ""slant-eye"" gestures at the audience, and people who look more like they belong to P.G.Wodehouse's universe than Gilbert & Sullivan's.  Did I like it?  In itself, it was a typically fresh-faced Jonathan Miller opera production, of the same quality he bestowed on Mozart opera some years ago.  But then, this is not Mozart, and Japan doesn't cut it looking like the Miami hotel in the Marx Brothers' classic, ""Coconuts"".

2409699,1,B000BB150W,"Short, sweet, and to the point, I was extremely disappointed in this version of THE MIKADO.  I guess I should have known it would be a poor production when a NEW copy is selling for $1.62.  I learned a valuable, albiet inexpensive, lesson though.  From now on I will read the reviews before making a purchase.",1170979200,,309,4.482142857142857
2409700,5,B000BB150W,excellent in every aspect from staging direction and performance. I highly recommed it to any one who likes G&S.,1167955200,,112,4.947368421052632
2409701,5,B000BB150W,"There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever, but that is only so long as I'm not listening to Iolanthe. Be that as it may, The Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas. (Yes, I put the composer first. Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppe, or Balfe. Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time, so they put his name first. It's time that silly practice was put to rest.

Anyway, The Mikado is a compleat S&G operetta. It has some of Sullivan's catchiest numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's cleverest lyrics. It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness. And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming.

This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, turns its imagination toward striking simplicity. Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Noveau period, it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely. The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites, grey, and blacks, accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to exclaim, ""Oh, pooh. Bah!"" (Did I just say that?)

It's most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD.  However, one caveat:  the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy.  The tendency to superimpose images is, alas, annoying.  Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort?

But it's the performance that counts the most. We may skip the overture, since although one is performed, Sullivan never wrote one. (True, it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys. But the Mikado overture doesn't even date from Sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it's first-rate and supremely funny.

The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle, who does it credit. There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role. The was a U.S. TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is delightfully quirky ... he does ""Taken from a county jail"" assisted by a tennis racquet. His ""I've Got a Little List"" is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much funnier than the usual run of such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. It goes on that way throughout.

In this operetta, it's important to have a good Katisha; it's just no fun if you're not being bellowed at in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle. She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially, for a soprano. And her costume...!!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying.)

Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during ""A Wand'ring Minstrel"", where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of ""his nancy on his knee"" -- bear in mind the Mikado's decree about flirting.  Be that as it may, Bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-Poo, his performance does.

Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly. She and Bottone do lovely duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody marvelous, with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics.

I don't recommend you get this as your only Mikado.  Get a good traditional production as well, so ou can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging.  That being said, I'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once.  On the whole this is a terrific offering, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and all. Watch for the bellhops with signs.",1163030400,,4831,4.759569377990431
2409702,3,B000BB150W,"The quality of this DVD is disappointing, both in video and audio. It IS a clever production, but the flaws are too great to make it a real joy, even with Eric Idle. The Stratford Festival production is a much better DVD.",1142553600,,221,4.285714285714286
2409703,3,B000BB150W,"You would think that it was a match made in heaven. After all, Gilbert & Sullivan were the 19th century version of Monty Python, with delightfully silly things that let you laugh at things that really didn't matter.

Eric Idle is, in fact, among the best things about this version of the Mikado. There are moments when he falls out of the role of Lord High Executioner and into the Minister of Silly Walks, but I think we all *hope* for that. That isn't what's disappointing here.

The worst thing about this DVD is the sound quality. If you don't know all the words to the Mikado (based on many listening to a D'Orly Carte CD), you won't have the first idea what the people are singing here and you will have NO idea what is going on. It's that bad. (If you *do* know the words, you'll be exhausted at the end of the opera, because your ears will have worked overtime for the last two hours.)

In part, the sound quality is a reflection of the ""movie making,"" such as it is. This show is the result of a few people with movie cameras photographing a stage play (unlike, say, the Pirates of Penzance movie with Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline, which is truly a movie... and darned good, too). Occasionally, the cameraman found it necessary to get ""creative,"" which in this case was not a good idea.

The other issue is the creative decision to place the opera in England, in a 1920s-30s cross between Hollywood (the Mikado himself as Fatty Arbuckle) and the Ascot Races from My Fair Lady. It doesn't work very well for me, because the absurdity of Englishmen in Japanese kimonos is part of the appeal of the Mikado, for me. But maybe I'm just an old fuddy-duddy in this regard.

I'm almost done with this review and I've said very little about the performance. Mostly, it's because one can barely hear it. However, Eric Idle does a decent job of singing his part (I don't think we were expecting Caruso), and most of the cast does a good-to-excellent job. None of it is jarring -- if only I could hear it!

The major ""extra"" on the DVD is a ""making of"" feature in which the camera records the stage rehearsals. It's fun, and since the sound quality is so much better, I enjoyed several of those performances more!

Should you buy this? Maybe. If you're a die-hard fan of G&S or the Monty Python crew, it's worth watching, once. I'm not really sorry I got this, just that it didn't live up to expectations. On the other hand, if you want the full entertainment of the Mikado, there are probably better recordings. (In fact, the subset you get from the fiction-ish G&S bio, Topsy Turvy, has a much better presentation of the opera.)",1140912000,,2629,4.453222453222454
2409704,5,B000BB150W,"I was in the chorus in the early 1960s in New Zealand when my school (Southwell School) put on the Mikado and have loved it ever since. My D'Oyly Carte LP version has been much played over the years.

I first saw this version of The Mikado in Australia many years ago. As a Gilbert and Sullivan purist, I thought that I was going to hate this updated version. I was completely wrong.

Although the setting has been moved to a hotel lobby and moved forward in time to the 1920s (?), the production is first rate. The casting is excellent with no weaknesses. Standout scenes for me were (naturally) the ""list"" song, the trio between Pooh Bah, Koko and Pish Tush (one of my favourites)and of course Yum Yum's start to Act 2.

Katisha's various songs are the best I have ever seen. It is hard to dislike the villain of the piece when she (Felicity Palmer)

8084070,3,B000BB150W,"Excellently staged and cast version of ""The Mikado"" misses the point entirely.  Anyone who loves the world of P. G. Wodehouse will enjoy the costumes and so forth.  Fine.  And Richard Van Allen, unlike Eric Idle, is a genuine singer.  But the point of ""The Mikado"" was to make fun of (in his unique, conservative way . . . it always seems to be the conservatives who are the best satirists because their humor at the foibles of their society doesn't get nasty) English society while casting his very, very English people in Japanese garb.  To cast it with Japanese-looking people in an English setting (English playing English while looking Japanese) is pretty dumb.  Furthermore, it can even be seen as racist, since the period they're in (apparently 1920s, since they have aeroplanes that carry passengers and such) the Japanese were actually trying hard to westernize before WW2.

Some of the songs are rendered wonderfully.  Idle is a disgrace.  A lot is expected of former Pythons and Idle is always over the top (unless he's going insane stage business like licking the sole of the Mikado's shoe).  Gilbert always said the humor should come from the words and characters, not stage business.  Idle didn't get that memo.  Since the Victorian Era is nothing more than history book stuff it's possible Gilbert's satire is inexplicable per se.  But most G&S performances for the tube these days have to plug in a non-G&S star to draw viewers, which is a shame.  And when you plug in an Eric Idle people expect him to be over the top, so the producers get what they pay for.",1487376000,,1575,4.721611721611722
