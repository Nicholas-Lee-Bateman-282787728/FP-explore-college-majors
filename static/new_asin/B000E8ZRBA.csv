Director John Huston's THE MISFITS was scripted by Arthur Miller (Marilyn's ex). It concerns four very troubled and lonely individuals.

G&aacute;y (Gable) is an aging rodeo roper who hates the idea of working for wages. He and small plane pilot Guido (Wallach) eke out a living catching the few wild mustangs that still roam Nevada's mountains to sell them for dog food at 6 a pound. Guido's wife is dead, G&aacute;y's left him and took their two kids.

Pierce (Clift) is an accident-prone rodeo rider with a huge drinking problem. He's haunted by memories of seeing his dad accidentally killed by a hunter. Roslyn (Monroe) is a club dancer and new divorc&eacute;e who falls for the much older G&aacute;y. She happily fits right in with his little group, unaware of their cruel horse huntng tactics. Seeing for herself what rounding up entails, Roslyn first tries interfering, then offers to pay for the animals' freedom.

THE FAMOUS ""CURSE""
Clark Gable died of a coronary two months before this film hit theaters. It's been said the hard physical labor required in THE MISFITS may have hastened his death. Marilyn Monroe followed Gable to the grave in mid-1962 of an apparent suicide or accidental OD. Monty Clift's demise came from heart disease in '66, after too many years of drug and alcohol abuse. He was 45. By contrast, the fourth member of their unlucky quartet, Eli Wallach, continued working until four years before his 2014 death, at age 98.

Another ""Misfits"" player, 58-year-old 'B' westerner Rex Bell, succumbed to a heart attack in 1962 while campaigning for Nevada governor. This was also character actor James Barton's final big screen appearance. He too passed in 1962. You may remember Barton as the grizzled tall tale spinner in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TIME-OF-YOUR-LIFE/dp/B0000C8AWZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE</a>&nbsp;(1948), with Jimmy Cagney.

8107480,5,B000E8ZRBA,"The well-deserved notoriety of this 1961 B & W classic THE MISFITS is two-fold: the film is a stunning triumph which withstands the test of time, as well as the tragic swan song of two of its principal players. Both Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable would be dead within a year of its release. Monroe's then-husband, playwrite Arthur Miller, scripted the role of vulnerable Roslyn specifically for Monroe. Roslyn is an emotionally damaged woman who travels to Reno for a divorce. In Reno, she falls in with  Gable's aging cowboy, Gay, and Eli Wallach's embittered Guido. The two men are drifters, ostensibly running from the dread prospect of ""earning a wage,"" when, in fact, they are running from the failures they have made of their lives. Enter Montgomery Clift's sensitive Perce, a battered rodeo rider going no where. Venerable director John Huston helmed the picture, and, with unprecedented sympathy for Monroe's infamous diva-idiosyncracies, he coaxed an incandescent and matchless performance from her. She willingly shed the sexual facial tics and affected mannerisms which had long characterized her screen appearances. With new and savage honesty, she portrayed a woman of equal parts street-savvy and childlike naivete, a woman teetering on the brink of damnation who is nevertheless called on to act as savior to the lost souls of three no-count men. It is, perhaps, ironic that Monroe, the undisputed Sex Icon of the 1950's and 1960's, was cast in a role that essentially defines ""Woman."" She is All Things to the three men who have become her make-shift family. She is Mother, weeping for them when they are hurt. She is Erotic Fantasy, dancing recklessly with one and kissing another. She is Cheerleader, bolstering their bruised egos and applauding even their most pathetic efforts. She is Guardian, watching oevr them when they, in their perpetual drunkenness and irresponsibility,  might otherwise harm themselves. The film's harrowing climax is, of course, the stuff of legend. It is the habit of the three men, ever in need of money and diversion, to go ""mustanging,"" whereby, employing appallingly primitive and cruel tactics, they round up the mustangs that roam wild on Nevada's open range and sell them for slaughter to a dog-food factory. Monroe, one of their number now, unwittingly accompanies them on their latest ""mustanging"" jaunt. The collision course is perilously set between the innate humanity of Woman and the dark side of men. Mention must be made of one of the movie's more interesting - and disturbing - footnotes. Gable's character engages in riveting hands-on combat with a stallion that resists capture. 59-year-old Gable, like the aging cowboy he brilliantly portrayed, was in denial about his own spent youth, and, obstinately refusing a stunt double, he insisted on performing the violent action sequence himself, which unquestionably led to his massive and fatal heart attack only two days after filming was completed.",1150675200,,2963,5.196652719665272
