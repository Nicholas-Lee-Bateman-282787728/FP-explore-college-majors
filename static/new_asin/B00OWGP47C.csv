6775591,4,B00OWGP47C,"I grew up with the original ThunderCats and enjoyed the show when I was younger. The original though really should stay in the past. I have watched a few of the episodes and rediscovered the level of lameness I was willing to accept at 7yrs old. I had heard that cartoon network had started and really enjoyed the series. 30 years after falling in love with the original I couldn't tollerate it but this series was well written, animated better, and left that horrible 80's overly goody two shoes behind...  by comparison that is.

Completely disappointed that they canceled the series and didn't even finish the story line they had started. Its a great show and certainly worth the time to stream the show but no reason to purchase a show the network didn't feel they needed to put any faith behind. At this point you are only supporting Cartoon network and not the future liveliness of the show.",1415145600,20,897,4.635220125786163
6775592,2,B00OWGP47C,"Lame,  Lame release.

Until  they release the original 1980's series on Blu-ray, this is a no buy for me, since the remake sucks!!",1415059200,6,130,4.565217391304348
6775593,3,B00OWGP47C,"Cartoon Network pulled the plug on this in the middle of the story.  Even though this was better written, and had a less-episodic plot (telling a saga), it was cancelled, effectively, mid-run, even though it seemed to be rather well received.
Just be aware of this before you go in.  There is no  conclusion or decent stopping point, and because it is NOT episodic, it will feel as if you ""had the rug pulled out from underneath you,"" when you reach the end of the last episode.",1414713600,166,478,4.471264367816092
6775594,4,B00OWGP47C,"I'm really happy the 2011 ThunderCats reboot is getting a complete release on Blu-ray. I watched the series on Cartoon Network and enjoyed it quite a bit. With this Blu-ray edition, though, the images will be even sharper than what I saw on TV. However, I could only give this FOUR stars instead of five because there are no notable extras on this set. For what it's worth, though, at least viewers can enjoy all 26 episodes in one shot instead of getting three ""books"" worth.",1414281600,34,476,4.546511627906977

6775599,5,B00OWGP47C,This series was great! My 3 kids and I binge watched it straight through in one evening. They were exposed to it for the first time and loved it. The animation is superb. There's not a single episode we didn't like. In fact it's difficult to say which episodes are our favorites since we enjoyed them all so much.

6775620,5,B00OWGP47C,"Came in good condition and on time. As far as I can say about this series, it is an epic remake of an original classic. The story starts off the same way as the original, and from there onward the series explores into other new territories and introducing new characters along the way. One of the things that I loved from watching this series is when they explained the origins of the Sword of Omens. Along with great voice acting and story progression, this was a great experience.

The only bad thing I can say about the series is that it was unfinished. Even though this did gain a good number of viewers when it aired on cartoon network, but the amount of viewers wasn't enough to call it a success. There are some things that I like about this age of TV entertainment and there are some things that I hate. This is what drives me nuts about the industry today. When it comes to TV shows that actually have great potential and gains a cult following, they're often marked as failure and scrapped because it's not getting enough viewer support. This doesn't make the show a failure it just means that there are areas that need improvement. But is the production company willing to take the time to make those improvements, of course not. :- /",1465603200,3,1245,4.4605263157894735

6775631,4,B00OWGP47C,"This new version of Thundercats from the 80s is very different from the original. In some sense it focuses on more mature topics, delves deeper into psychology, shows Lion-O's growth from a relatively young cub to a more mature and confident leader of the Thundercats. Thematically and visually the new series could appeal to a new fan base. In fact I liked this remake myself,but only because I viewed it as a separate entity, a new series in its own right, somewhat related to Thundercats but not sufficiently. Granted, I may have been a bigger fan of the original than many other fans visiting this page, having the Sword of Omens as a pendant and Penthro as well as Mumm Ra for my toys. So I would not be surprised if the differences I see is not something to bother a more casual viewer, but...
Snarf without his legendary ""Snarf, Snarf?"" In what universe does that make sense? Claudus being a difficult father to handle, Jaga becoming a harsh instructor instead of the gentle one I remember. Mutant Slithe without his customary ""yes?"" phrase that virtually identified him from the other Mutants, and no Vultureman whatsoever, I could understand no Jackalman or Monkian, but Vultureman was another Mutant that had his own significance. And Mumm Ra insisting on announcing his transformation process...If you remember the series well, the original Mumm Ra would say ""to Mumm Ra the Ever Living"", at the end, not ""into Mumm Ra the ever Living"" as does the remake. Or Lion-O sounding almost uncertain at the end of his triple ""ThunderCats"" proclamation. I don't understand how such minute changes were necessary when they don't add anything to the plot other than saying, ""look, I am different from the original."" LOl
So I personally understand why the series did not last. If all we expected was ThunderCats, well we barely had even any episodes with Mumm Ra, only a little of Claudus, Grune and Jaga and the ThunderCats we did see had their history a bit changed. The only reason I can watch the series and enjoy it is because it had many nice touches after all, without meeting my idea of Thundercats or a cartoon(I see a difference between cartoons and animes and in the case of this series, the difference was not a favorable one for me).
On the positive side of the sequel is good visual affects, more races of animals are shown, some familiar faces show up, among them Tygra, Cheetara, Lion-O, Jaga, Claudus, Penthro, Lynxo, and Grune. The kids are actually more realistic in this version than the original, which I liked. If I am not mistaken, without verifying my facts it appeared that the voice of Penthro belonged to the original character as well while Claudus, the previous Lord of the ThunderCats and father of Lion-O might have been voiced by the actor who did the original Lion-O, at least sounded a lot like him, which contributed greatly to my acceptance of the new series. There is also enough humor, values and battles, and new characters that play a major role are well defined and memorable.
So, overall, my impression of the new Thundercats was positive, if I saw it as another series on Youtube I would definitely try it out, and in that the creators definitely did admirably.",1451692800,,3203,4.741935483870968
6775632,5,B00OWGP47C,"You can't go wrong with the ThunderCats! My son grew up obsessed with them and had almost every toy they made. Now that he is a dad, he still loves them and has some very fond memories, thus the reason for this purchase!

Too bad it was canceled early.  Bring it back, finish it off properly.",1446854400,2,302,4.788461538461538
6775638,5,B00OWGP47C,"I purchased this for my husband for our anniversary (1/3 of his gift) because he loves Thundercats. Although this is the reboot and there have been a lot of people who feel it doesn't do the original justice, my husband enjoyed the story line. It's (believe it or not) a Rankin/Bass production.

This bluray set packs the entire series onto two disks, where the dvd version is 6 disks long. There are no special features at all that we could find, just the series itself.

The only thing my husband never liked about this series is that it just abruptly ends. They didn't tie it up at all and we feel they could have done far more with it and brought in more characters, but it seems like it was just canceled at the last minute.",1445385600,3,729,4.352941176470588
6775639,5,B00OWGP47C,"This might be controversial, but I think this is better than the original Thundercats series, which doesn't really stand up in terms of plot, or animation quality.

These are beautifully animated, and there is a plot arc running through the entire season. This is only partially resolved by the end, and was supposed to be concluded in a second season which never happened. A shame, but still recommended.",1443398400,6,405,4.955882352941177

It would still be on the air if the morons in charge of programming had an IQ higher than 12 and knew how to schedule properly.  My whole family from the 2 year old daughter through my teenage son and up to my 72 year old father all sat and enjoyed this together.

Not according to original series. i thought that this originally started with the first chapter entitled, :Exodus"" This is where The Thunder cats flee their home planet of Thundera i guess I'll try to purchase another set with the original story lines in it and all.

UPDATE! Wednesday,  JULY 1, 2015. I  was so disappointed  with the complete Blue Ray series as I personally felt that it didn't hold true to Thunder cats original  story line I went ahead and ordered the regular DVD  Season One. I received it today, and all I can say is WOW! THUNDER CATS! HO! This is the Thunder cats cartoon that I remember in the 1980's. How do I know this? My son was born in 1985. He is now 30 years old. I can even remember the very first episode entitled.""Exodus"" when they left their home planet of Thundera. Here  I'm  writing about the DVD version. It you're a true to form Thunder cats fan, I do not recommend purchasing the complete series. Not the sellers fault at all of course, but who was out to lunch on this one??.

6775677,4,B00OWGP47C,"Only thing which reduced this to 4 stars was the complete lack of special features. C'mon WB, it's great finally having it in hi-def, but not a single special feature showing the evolution and making of this update to a classic 80's toon? Interviews or commentary with the voice cast, ANYTHING?!

This is 2014 people, you're lucky I didn't drop more points for such a half-done release.",1419033600,,386,4.7611940298507465
6775678,5,B00OWGP47C,"This is the best example of how to remake an old series. The animation, the chararcter designs, music and such an awesome origin and story is just wonderful. I've seen the original series and I thought it was fantastic for its time, a little campy somewhat with stiff dialogues and mediocre voice acting. For those who hates this remake is stuck in the past and set their minds not to like this wonderful anime-esque remake and it's truely sad. Everything about this remake is top notch and I was legitimately disappointed when I heard they stopped the production after 3 seasons due to bad advertising and placement of the show in a wrong timeslot and channel, the same reason how xena warrior princess show ended. The creators put everything into this show and nothing was overlooked, lion-o's sword, the thundertank, the character's abilities are all there and they use it too, (Lion-o and his friends actually cuts and beats the hell out of their foes) not like the old show where it shows maybe once per episode and no one gets actually beaten. Lion-o and the others are strong and they're not overshadowed by their leader, each characters and how they joined Lion-o is a great way to show the audience instead of them just being there as a background figures compared to Lion-o. Character development to fresh origin along with fantastic voice casts, this remakes is deserves the very best praise one can receive. I'm really hoping they'll continue the series because it was just unfair how it ended. 5 stars isn't good enough.

The blu-ray is too basic and nothing in the way of extras, no anamorphic menues, no music or scenes from the episode on the menu, its like they didn't even try.

Buy this bluray for the show, not for whats in the disc and enjoy this wonderful remake.",1418515200,,1785,4.699680511182109

6775683,2,B00OWGP47C,"No slip cover, only a simple wraparound depicting the remade characters under a 2005 WB classic series logo, not the 2011 series' logo - an odd choice. Discs are similar in design, with Lion-O being the only remade character included on each of them.

All episodes that aired are included in this set. The disc menus are the same, static and without music or sound effects. There aren't any ""special features,"" nor any option to change languages - both audio and subtitles (for the hearing impaired) are in English.

The only plus is that the episodes are in beautiful HD quality, audio is clear and so far no defects have appeared.

If you still want this set, I suggest waiting until it is being offered at a ""deep"" discount unless you enjoy buyer's remorse after paying $20-25 for such a bare bones set as this.",1417651200,9,814,4.6

6775686,5,B00OWGP47C,"A wonderful remake! A friend of mine introduced me to Thundercats when this remake first aired. I was hooked after watching the first hour special. I think the animation is gorgeous and the storyline is awesome (that's why I give it 5 stars). My favorite character in this remake is obviously Snarf (the new snarf is better than the old one). Anyways, as some other reviews stated; this Thundercats remake is NOT the Complete Series. Here's information I found on that:

""Initially planned for 52 episodes, it was confirmed by ThunderCats art-director Dan Norton in early 2013 that the show had been canceled after only one season.""

Why was it canceled? I have no idea. Usually a series is canceled if it didn't make enough money (reached it's goal) or the company had problems with the copyrights. Anyways, I think this series is worth getting. Now don't get me wrong, the original Thundercats is a classic, but this remake expresses a big wow.",1416873600,27,946,4.7975460122699385

6775690,5,B00OWGP47C,"I was waiting for this release for a while, and now that it's out, Thunder, Thunder, ThunderCats Ho! A great series cut short because of the circumstances, but before getting axed, it produced an entire season of action packed episodes, 26 in total. In Blue-Ray, the series shines, with vivid colors and excellent sound. Story wise, it merged the past series lore with new ideas that kept it fresh for the new audience, and maintained long time fans wanting to see more. Blue-Ray wise, it comes only with the episodes, no extras whatsoever. I hate to see a series like this getting canned, it deserves a second chance. The WB has been doing this lately, (Young Justice, Green Lantern, etc.), maybe doing movies of it would be a good idea. The series is entertaining and fun to watch with everyone, buy it if you're a fan or not. HO!",1415836800,13,832,4.590604026845638
6775691,5,B00OWGP47C,"Loved this series. Short lived, but way better than the original (like the Cartoon Network He-Man remake cartoon). This show, like many others, should have lasted longer.",1415836800,,170,5.333333333333333
6775692,4,B00OWGP47C,"I absolutely loved this back when it aired on Cartoon Network. In fact, I looked forward to it every night there was a new episode. I loved that the developers were trying to please both the original fans and the new fans. It was brilliant to me. However, I was highly disappointed when Cartoon Network cancelled the show. (Highly disappointed might not even begin to describe just how let down I was by their decision.)

This set does not contain any special features or commentary, which is also kind of a huge let down, as I was hoping for a better closure to the series or maybe a spark in the future for a second season to finish the show. On the other side, it's probably cheaper than purchasing the individual dvds (or books as I've seen them called). I was actually kind of let down by the blu-ray release. :/",1415750400,,817,4.410596026490066
6775693,5,B00OWGP47C,Love the series both remake and old. As it's pointed out there is an open kind of ending where there was much to be done when CN Pulled the plug on Airing it BUT the creators were in the process of finishing off the series so I would say this isn't the Complete series as it says but there will be something extra to come to finish it off or atleast I hope so since the series was good.,1415318400,,386,3.8987341772151898
6775694,5,B00OWGP47C,"I was delighted to see the new version of my -one time favorite- show on the screen again. I'm also an avid anime fan, so I instantly fell in love with the looks of the series.  With this version, the world seemed so much larger and detailed now, with many creatures populating the cities and the world.  Not only that, we were getting to know more about each and every character this time around.  Both the characters and the story were developing very nicely, and then... nothing.  They cancelled the show, without a proper ending.

I think the show challenged the attention span of the targeted age group a bit, and failed.  Had this show been episodic, monster of the week kind of show, it might had a chance.",1415232000,18,713,4.488372093023256
