7846669,5,6303444385,"Probably the best documentry on the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Company. In depth and entertaining with numerous celebrities presenting each chapter of Harley Davidson's history. Excellent historical footage cleverly spliced with clips from well-known motorcycle movies.  Enhanced with interviews of unique and everyday HD owners, as well as nice footage of riding in the wind. Deserves a re-release on DVD.",1026950400,2,406,5.88135593220339
