646119,5,6303421016,"I think this is one of the better films Macaulay Culkin did during his child actor career. It was generally poor received by critics, but it's still one of my favorites. Culkin delivers a great performance. This is a must have for any Culkin fan.",1027814400,9,246,4.488888888888889
646120,1,6303421016,"extremely fair family comedy that highlights macaulay culkin's plunge into cheesiness.  it's very unfortunate that such a talented child actor had to be forced down the tubes with fare like this and pagemaster.  i guess you'll like it if you're a ted danson fan, but that's about it",993513600,4,282,4.854166666666667
646121,4,6303421016,"In yet another enjoyable performance, Macaulay Culkin plays an 11 year old kid who has not had that much quality time with his dad, who is an ex-con.  Just as his father (Ted ""Sam Malone"" Danson) is about to commit one final  robbery, Culkin arrives for a visit and disrupts his fathers plans.  In turn,  Culkin hides his father's loot that was just stolen and only says he will give it back if his father does time-- as a dad.  Culkin is great as usual, and Danson does  as good a job as he did as his ""Cheers"" womanizer.  It does bear a little  resemblence to the ""Home Alone"" movies, eespecially two of Dansons' cohorts  (Saul Rubineck and Gailard Sartain).  But it makes the movie all the more fun.  Don't miss this one!",940118400,8,724,4.368421052631579
646212,4,6303421016,"A fun movie about A young boy who just wants to spend time with his dad & when he has been dropped off by his newly married mom he finds out his dad, with his two friends, has just stolen their biggest score yet. He hides it & says he'll give it back after he spends the week with him. I enjoyed it as A kid & you can't go wrong with Macaulay Culkin.",1383264000,2,350,3.7432432432432434
646213,4,6303421016,"When I received the Dvd I never suspected anything wrong with it so I wrapped it up for a xmas present.  I never had any problems with the company, so when I was told that it didn't play that it was a 2 instead of a 1 in the world logo on the back of the Dvd.  I contacted the company and they gave me my money back I was so happy that we were able to come to a solution about my Dvd.  I never detected that it was a 2 when I bought but I do look closer now so that doesn't happen again, I still deal with the company, I like the way they send my videos and cd's. They are very prompt and they package everything very well.",1327363200,,623,3.7045454545454546
646214,4,6303421016,"I love the movie. However the movie company that released this movie on dvd needs to make a higher quality packaging etc. The stickers always ruin the cover art, the cases cuz cheap get damaged in transit all the time, etc. I shouldnt have to go search ebay or here to find a good case and I should have to order another copy just to get a good disc good case and good cover.",1327104000,,375,4.081081081081081

646219,1,6303421016,"Saturday August 14th, 1994. I was still rather uncertain about the future. I had asked Jesus into my heart 2 days before watching this movie, and thought things would be a breeze. Don't hold your breath Dan. It got even more confusing as I was trying to get with one of 2 girls at this time. One was the daughter of the woman who planted the seed for me to come to Jesus, and another one was a baby Christian who was in love with someone else. Well I went out with the girl of the woman, and I made so many mistakes that night. For starters I didn't know how to do a date properly. I made her pay for her ticket, and then she brought her cousin along, so I couldn't consider this to be a proper date anyway. It was a movie I really wasn't all that up to seeing anyway after Caulkin did ""The Good Son"", and the forgettable ""Nutcracker"" I felt his talent was spent as far as the movies would go. This had Danson as a Sam Malone wannabe. Apparently things didn't go too well with Whoopie, and he would try to get back into the groove rather quickly with doing another shallow character who was only concerned about himself. Well this was supposed to be a comedy, but it was far too serious. They would also use the Countors ""Do You Love Me"" for the umpteeenth millionth time, and what seemed like it was supposed to be a simple cute movie turned out into being a long-drawn out night not only for the movie, but also me. I learned alot that night, and it was stored away until now. Here are the lessons I want to pass onto you:

For those about to date I salute you.

1. Pay for you and your date. If your date brings someone along for protection use discretion, and know your budget you may be able to pay for them too which could, and I emphasize ""COULD"" get you some brownine points with the girl.

2. There's no such thing as ""Dutch"" unless you 2 get serious and steady.

3. Go with what your heart tells you. Don't be confused with what anyone tries to tell you. I know that morning that the woman was trying to say ""Back Off"", and if she doesn't respond it wasn't meant to be. I know that it's a risk, and believe me I feel that if I wasn't desparate I wouldn't have bothered with her too much after the first couple of times when she say ""Call Me"", but she'd not be home, and I would not hear from her again. However, begin to learn about discernment through books on dating, and from your peers.

4. Give it up for getting that all important ""First Kiss"" It won't happen unless you do everything immaculate. Don't even think of getting her pants off either. Movies lie to you about that. If you tried, and this is coming from a man who gets frustrated quick Don't go away mad.

5. Be sure to take care of yourself. I mean the car I drove was an eyesore, and because I didn't know how to take care of those things the girl actually took the dented part off because she was experienced with that; how humiliating. If you don't know how to do car repair you can learn online, or have a friend help you learn. Also...well this is one thing I did know about, and that was Come to your date reasonably clean.

6. Of course thank the girl for going out with you.

These are just 6 of the lessons I learned that night, and the movie well I almost forgot about it until recently. I just feel it's a long, drawn-out flick that was top heavy on the serious side of comedy. It was probably worthy of at least 2 razzies.",1160784000,2,3412,4.159090909090909
646220,3,6303421016,"I have mixed feelings on this movie. Is the Culkin kid dude or woman? Its like he's both genders. I wonder if Ted Danson knows? I mean i know he's a dude in home alone and saved but then there's this and party monster and i think ""Is this Shlong, i'm watching or is this thing, this creature a Chic?

Does anyone know? What happened to becker? Has anyone ever seen this movie? I guess not.",1126828800,,389,4.118421052631579
646221,5,6303421016,"When first saw this movie on Abc Familey I knew I was going to like it. This movie also has Ted Danson it. It's about Father & Son Relationship. Macaulay Culkin looks older in this movie than the others he did like Both Home,Uncle Buck & My Girl. He was propbably 13 at that time he made that movie. I loe this movie,I gotta get this movie!!!!",1089936000,5,343,4.134328358208955

7847103,5,6303421016,"Why can't movies be this enjoyable anymore? The 80's and 90's were the best times to make a family film.  There's just something magical about popping in an old classic movie and watching it.  I highly doubt movies that are made nowadays won't be as memorable.  It just brings back the kid in me.  While this movie isn't as good as Home Alone, it's about 98.9% close to it.  It's funny, sad and heartwarming.  If you're a fan of Macaulay Culkin's early work then, here you go!",1397347200,,476,4.413793103448276
