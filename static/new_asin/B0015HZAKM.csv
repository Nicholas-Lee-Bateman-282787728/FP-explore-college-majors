8258493,4,B0015HZAKM,"Dated, but still current. Walking across Scotland - both historic and present day, including following the footsteps of Bonnie Prince Charlie's escape to France. You feel like a local watching this DVD. Of particular interest are the Gillies that manage a large land area including trees, red deer and soils (the DVD follows them during winter with snow on the ground).

Thinking of visiting Scotland? Watch this DVD first to find the wilder places, even adjacent to cities. You are shown how to ""read the landscape"" to tell what has come before. What happened to the coniferous forests (removed for grazing) and are the forests coming back (with stewardship).",1236902400,,660,5.055045871559633
8258494,5,B0015HZAKM,"This is an eccentric and absolutely delightful look at several gorgeous places in Scotland.  Our charming, spry, and unassuming guide is a veteran traveler in the country, and his knowledge of history and local people adds to the fascination of his film.  The film itself has not been remastered (as is admitted on screen), and more maps should have been used, especially in the first segment.  Still, anglophiles won't want to miss this gem.  Indeed, anyone interested in the beauties and stories of Scotland will want to purchase at least one copy.",1211932800,3,550,4.945652173913044
