2334591,4,B0009XRZK6,"Susan Winter Ward is a dynamic teacher. Her instructions are very clear. The DVD although for Bigginers, would also be good for intermediate practitioners.  This is a Vinyasa Style of Yoga and deals with the entire body.  Excellent DVD - I love it.",1173484800,13,248,4.744186046511628

8069672,5,B0009XRZK6,"Susan Winter Ward is an amazing instructor.  I was so out of shape when I started yoga 9 months ago.  I am amazing myself with the results.  I immediately connected with my yoga instructor and am able to take classes with her twice a week.  After seeing my results I thought I could do even better if I practiced my yoga at least every other day.  After trying 6 other dvds I was recommended to Susan by a lady in my class.  These dvds make you feel as if you are in an actual class at the studio.  Susan has a calming and inspirational way of instructing.  She explains every move so anyone can understand.  The other dvds I purchased are pretty cold, clinical and difficult to follow.  Perhaps I will use them at a later date.  For now I have all three of Susan's and will continue to use them on the days when I'm not attending my live classes.  I HIGHLY recommend all three of Susan's dvds to anyone who wants to transform their mind and body at ANY age.  If you are just starting do only what you can.  You will make steady improvement and be thrilled by the results.",1399852800,,1072,4.216748768472907
8069673,5,B0009XRZK6,"This is a wonderful gentle, relaxing yoga workout.  I am 50 years old and an intermediate level yoga practicioner who works from DVDs at home., and I was able to do all the poses comfortably.  The instructor is very pleasant and has a gentle voice as she guides you through the hour of yoga poses.  Every muscle in my body was stretched, and I felt wonderful after doing the workout!  She has a variety of people (male, female, older, and younger) doing the poses with her.  It really lives up to the title: Yoga for Every Body.  The music is gentle flute and dulcimer sounding rather like the Renaissance Faire, but it is relaxing not distracting.  This is yoga for relaxing after a long, hard day--not some strenuous pulse-pounding power yoga workout.",1389139200,,753,4.659090909090909
8069674,4,B0009XRZK6,Some moves are too difficult for older people. It would help to show ways to modify some of the moves.,1372723200,,102,4.15
8069675,4,B0009XRZK6,"I have taken Yoga classes for a couple of years off and on. I am ""obese"" according to weight charts, and over 50.  But need to continue the Yoga during non-class periods.  I like to be guided because I don't have the discipline to hold the poses long enough my self.  This Video is a good guide.

I like this video for the flow, length (almost an hour) and routine- stretches many areas.  It's well paced so that you can get into all the poses and get to hold the stretch.  It is not very strenuous.  I can't seem to do the pidgeon pose- puts too much stress on the knees, nor the ""pretzel moves"" I call them of twisting the waist.  Need to find other DVD to help me stretch those parts.",1309132800,,687,4.112781954887218
