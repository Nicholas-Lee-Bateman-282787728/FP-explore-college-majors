1172756,5,9089709339,"Wow, this title delivers in a way I didn't expect.  It has scenes of crystal clear aqua waters, but so much more.  It seems that the Isis Visuals team has made it their personal mission to provide viewers a full experience of the location on this disc.

This disc has all nature sounds matching the scenery  The main film shows transitional scenes around beaches, BUT the location chosen makes me think that the beaches are in several different parts of the world instead of just one place.  There is the white sand dream beach, as well as the rocky coast and tide pool type of scenes in the main films.  As with a lot of the films by this producer, you get to experience the beach from morning until dusk.

The beaches are completely clear of people, so you can feel like you are there experiencing the proverbial walk along the beach alone.  All of the gently transitioning scenes show a shoreline with gently lapping water. The wave ripples and tide are light, even at the rocky parts of the shore,  I love crashing waves, but this sets a slow and relaxing tempo that is utterly relaxing.

 A favorite part of this film is the switching the scene from looking our to the water to looking to the shore from the water.  The shoreline is a jungle setting.  I really like this, as I can make my imagination fill a 360 degree view of my location.  I also like shots into the water from a crystal clear location, revealing the rocks and coral under the shallow surface.

This disc provides a bonus 6 scenes, each spending a little more time at one of the locations we got to view in teh main fil. Both the aqua water and rocky shoreline types are represented, but a surprise to me was that one of the scenes has to be close to an all time favorite Isis Visual scene for me - the closing sunset.  I am not a fan of sunsets, not meaning that I don;t like them, but they re not a scene I would choose on its own in selecting nature scenes to watch.  I've seen orange, purples, and dark hues in many scenes, but this one is the most magical gold color I've ever seen, and has an along the shore view with symmetry that I couldn't even imagine being so perfect until I saw it.  The way that light and show meet in this scene is unforgettable.

This disc will remain high on my rotation list, and is another reason to give this production company a chance at providing your next vacation from the comfort of your couch!",1386460800,23,2410,4.315555555555555

You can imagine being on the beach watching the sea.

1172776,3,9089709339,"This could well be a 5* for any one who wants panoramic scenes of mountains, rocks, tree, boats as well as the beach.
I gave it a 3* because on I realized that I wanted more of a close up of a sunny sandy beach with out boats in the back ground.
I wanted more golden tones with very blue sky as I wanted this as background for a chic party. There is too much variety in this for me. Sound of breaking waves is very good. Color is too true to actual for me.
Rocks are too imposing & loom up in the middle of a nice beach scene as a large very dark unattractive presence.
But I am looking for a very specific type scene...this may very well be what you want if you like panoramic. Yet again this is a full day at the beach.
If any one knows of a golden sandy beach with soft breaking waves & very blue sky dvd with out fish & boats let me know.
I saw what I wanted in a chic lounge but they wouldn't give me details.",1390176000,5,914,3.8412698412698414

7901385,5,9089709339,"I LOVE the Tony Helsloot, directed, ambient dvd's. The films are vibrant and colorful, set to lovely, soothing music.. So relaxing, calming and serene. I know it sounds probably silly, to some people but I have (2) older rescue dogs, they both came from bad homes, with high levels of abuse and neglect. Our ""Ambient"" dvd collection, has helped both of them to calm down, to sleep better, and to be more relaxed . Both of them, now sleep soundly when the dvd's are on. There is no more anxiety, or fear from them, they love the music and the bird sounds. A family member, bought these as well, for her very fussy little toddler. The nature sounds soothed her, right down. After (3) nights of Ambient music with a nice tuck in before bed time, the toddler settled in and looked forward to what sounds she would hear, each night. The dvd's worked like a charm! The parents got more rest, as did the little child. These are also great when one is home, sick. The soothing sounds, music and videos are so calming, so peaceful, and so easy to fall asleep to. I just love them...all of them.",1495238400,,1085,4.43
