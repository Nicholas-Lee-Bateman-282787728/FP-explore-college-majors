8730953,2,B014JD2L96,"Since 1957 I've attended the most amazing Elektras in Europe and the USA.  Any new production can be (should be) most amazing and shocking.  But this production for all of the money invested, is just a big theatrical mess with lots of fire, filth, terrible amplification, an idiotic concept if one can call it that, and some basically mediocre singing start to finish.  If you really want a good laugh at how ridiculous it all is, then check out the arrival of Klytemnestra and gang, like a 'punching bag ensemble' and naked Mommy'.  This is a great example of a total waste of money on a ridiculous production which should never have happened.",1465430400,2,644,4.672566371681416
8730954,5,B014JD2L96,"From its beginning at the end of the 16th century, the spectacle has been an important part of the multi-media genre of opera. Audiences always wanted something bigger than the last opera, going back all the way to Peri's Dafne in 1598. When Phaton's chariot was pulled by horses on-stage in the Lully opera of the same name presented at Versailles in 1683, the composer had the latest theatrical technology available to him, and he wowed his audience and his King with special musical and theatrical effects; in other words, a spectacle.

Between then and today we've seen spectacle's role in opera rise and fall as fashions for naturalism or surrealism or minimalism or magic realism come and go. The complete takeover of the movies by CGI, 3D and other technology-enhanced goodies has raised the bar in terms of what audiences expect. Nowadays we always feel it's our right to be amazed, and more amazed than we were last time. It's also led to a bit of a backlash where live special effects become more important, re-balancing the mix with those effects  added in post-production (as in the amazing Mad Max: Fury Road). And of course live special effects are pretty much the only thing available in a live medium like opera.

There's a counter-balance to the bigger-is-better spectacle, even for an opera as blood-soaked as Elektra, the Freudian nightmare remix of ancient Greek myth put together by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss. This less-is-more idea has the enormous bottom-line advantage. Even with the large amount of blood in the TV teaser, the Norrlands Operan 2014 production of Elektra might have led to a relatively subdued affair, in the style of Hitchcock's Psycho. But no, with the frightening vision of Director Carlus Padrissa and the help of the Spanish theatrical collective La Fura Dels Baus they went big.

Blood is gushing forth in the barrack square.
Elektra is biding her time.
Enormous steel giants are rising.
Elektra curses her mother.
A forest is set on fire at Umestan.
Elektra demands revenge!

Just how big you'd only know if you were there in Ume in August of 2014, in front of the largest opera stage in the world. But you'll also get a pretty good idea from this really special DVD/Blu-ray from Unitel Classics.

Spectacle by itself is pretty empty, but that is definitely not the case here. The singing and acting of the principal singers is absolutely outstanding, beginning with the electrifying performance of Ingela Brimberg in the title role. Put Brimberg on an empty stage with a black fright wig and an axe, and she would provide a good percentage of the sheer horror we get from this performance. She's that good. A great deal of credit must also go to Rumon Gamba who keeps what must have been a spectacularly chaotic project from spinning out of control. That it didn't is due to his steadfast reliance on the music of Strauss and the drama of von Hofmannsthal. That's the real bottom line.",1462320000,2,2950,4.8316831683168315
8730955,5,B014JD2L96,"I went to the trouble of buying this from Amazon UK, because for some reason I couldn't find the listing here on Amazon.com. Truly spectacular production of my favorite opera. I don't normally like circus-acrobat based productions, but this one is different, as is Fura's version of Wagner's Ring. Sometimes they get a little carried away with the effects (I could have done without the Cadillac, for instance), but overall, their concepts are breathtaking. In the case of Elektra, they have made a production which does justice to the stature of the myth.",1461974400,,556,4.989247311827957
8730956,5,B014JD2L96,"WOW.....really a spectacular Elektra. I think this and the Aix en Provence's staged by Patrice Chereau, are the best Elektras in bluray.

Ingela Brimberg is spectacular in the title role. She has a strong and powerful voice perfect for this role. She is a very good actress too and much much better than other Elektras in the market (audio and video formats), except fon Nilsson's. There are many famous sopranos singing Elektra arround the world actually but I think hardly will reach the Ingela Brimbreg's level. Hope she add new roles to her repertoire as Salome, Isolde and Turandot.

The rest of the cast is very good too. The orchestra sounds great and very well conducted by Rumon Gamba.

People who does not like unconventional stages maybe will not like this production but it is really spectacular and a must have bluray. Giants with the singers singing inside their chests. bloody water and other special effects. Even though that does not distract the audience and makes a wonderful, powerful and BREATHTAKING performance. Wish I was there.",1452816000,,1052,4.965909090909091
