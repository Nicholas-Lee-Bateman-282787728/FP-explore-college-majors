1051470,5,6305613524,"Christopher Walken and Glenn Close headline the cast in this excellent series of three Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.
In the first movie of the series, ""Sarah, Plain and Tall,"" Walken plays a widowed Kansas farmer who desperately needs someone to help him rear his children while he tends to providing for the family via his farm in the early 1900s.  Glenn Close plays Sarah, a woman from Maine, who responds to Walken's newspaper ad search for a wife.  The rest of the story focuses on the developing relationships between Walken, Close, and the children.  An excellent story and great movie -- 5 stars all the way.
In the second movie, ""Skylark"" (sequel to Sarah, Plain and Tall), the story of Walken and Close's life continues as they face a severe drought, possible failure of the farm, and stresses those things place upon the family.  Top-notch, equal in emotional impact and believability with ""Sarah, Plain and Tall"" -- definitely another 5-star movie.
The third movie, ""Winter's End"" finds an unexpected guest in Walken and Close's home -- Walken's father, long absent from any family interactions.  In this movie, the children have grown considerably (I believe that all the members of the original cast are still together).  While an enjoyable movie, this one is not in the same class as the first two, and hovers someplace around 3.5 to 4 stars.
I awarded the set 5 stars on the collective strength of the first  two movies.
Just in case you hadn't noticed, Walken is often cast in somewhat quirky roles, but this is probably my favorite work of his.  He plays a devoted father dealing with a range of believable real-life issues.  These movies also underscore the incredible talent of Close, who can pull off roles as diverse as Sarah's and that of Disney's Cruella DeVil!
Do yourself a favor...if you haven't watched these movies, watch them.  They are wonderful.
Have a great day!

1051471,5,6305613524,"I have always loved the novel. I teach fifth grade, so it is a great historical fiction piece. The story takes place in 1910 Kansas, not Indiana, and is a story of coping with a loss, finding closure, and then  going on. Jacob and his two children, six year old Caleb and ten year old  Anna, with the loss of their wife and mother six years before. Sarah with  the loss of her Maine and the life she left there. There are many  heartwarming scenes so I won't attempt to mention them here. In the end,  Sarah does ""sing"" and ""she makes a difference"". Just  know that these films are something you can sit down and enjoy with your  entire family. I know there were quite a few hugs exchanged after we  finished each of them.",964051200,3,722,4.257352941176471
1051472,5,6305613524,"This trilogy is great viewing on television.  Sarah, Plain and Tall was the first, about a woman who comes from Maine to marry a man in Indiana (a mail-order type of thing).  When she arrives in Indiana she does not know  what to expect, but is pleasantly surprised that the man is quite  attractive.  She instantly gets along with the little boy, and the little  girl takes a little time to get used to her, but the entire family grows to  love Sarah, no matter how plain and tall she is.
In Skylark, it was more  of the same, a continuance of Sarah, Plain and Tall and the trials and  tribulations of living in a land where so many bad things can happen:  drought, fire, and so on.  Sarah takes the children back to Maine with her  after the Indiana barn burns to the ground and the drought is so bad  because the creek is almost out of water.  The little boy, Caleb, puts a  glass outside before he leaves Indiana so that when it rains, he will have  a glass of water to remember it by.  In Maine, the children meet Sarah's  aunts, who are all characters in themselves.  One of them likes to skinny  dip in the moonlight, and Caleb says she looks like a great white fish.  It  is in this movie that Sarah finds out she is to have a baby.  And at the  end of the movie when Jacob comes to take Sarah and the children home,  because there has been rain in Indiana, Sarah tells Jacob that she wants  their child to be born in Indiana.  It is very touching, and made tears  come to my eyes.
In the third, Winter's End, Sarah's little girl is  around 5 or 6 years old, and it rounds out the trilogy quite nicely.  I'm  just wondering what I've seen that little girl in before.
I would  recommend this entire set of movies to anyone who likes watching historical  information, especially that which is based on true stories.",961286400,3,1821,4.261764705882353
1051473,5,6305613524,"Great series of movies!
I first stumbled across this movie wondering what Christopher Walken would be like in a ""warm,fuzzy"" movie with Glenn Close!  Well, I was totally surprised and I thouroughly  enjoyed it!  The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.
I truely  cared about the Witting family - how they became a family, and the trials  that farm-life in the midwest in early 1900's provided the family.  This  three-part series was very warming!  A definate movie for families, and  people who simply enjoy sitting down with a wonderful movie that takes you  to another place and time.  A series which I really hate to see end.
I  rented the last in the series first, and promptly went back and rented the  first two.  I now own all 3 movies!
Highly recommended as a real  feel-good movie with wonderful charactors and good acting performances by  Glenn Close (as always), Christopher Walken and the rest!",947203200,29,911,4.780645161290322
1051474,5,6305613524,"I highly recommend the Sarah, Plain & Tall trilogy is for everyone - children and adults.  The story is heartwarming and the acting superior.  It portrays a ""true"" American family.",946857600,6,180,4.966666666666667
1051475,5,6305613524,"This trio of movies follows very closely the books by the same author.  Sarah answered an ad for someone to ""make a difference"". She felt a move was necessary and this was, perhaps, her only chance to make a life  of her own.  She did not expect such a stubborn man, but fell in love with  Caleb and Anna.  The story was first a children's book, then the movies  started, and even we adults can relate to the gentle relationships that  formed, the family spirit in times of tragedy, and the antics of being a  blended family.  I especially liked the fact the movies follow the books so  closely up to the point they needed to enhance to complete the time frame.  I recommend these 3 videos for warmth, sincerity and easy watching.",946598400,2,730,4.413533834586466

1051628,5,6305613524,"I bought this movie for my 93-year-old mom, and she loves this old-fashioned, down-on-the-farm drama. It's a good story about, essentially, a mail-order bride who comes to the farm from New England. In the changes she faces challenges with and alongside her husband, but they're both strong and adapt, and they demonstrate the practical value of simple honest thinking.  Glenn Close and Christopher Walken, who have played in so many steep dramas, are at cruising altitude with the strong and lovely people they play in this movie.",1516838400,,531,5.103448275862069

Very disappointed with the fact that the first movie in the series was in this package twice and the second movie Skylark wasn't in the package as it was supposed to be. Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't watch the second movie. I paid a lot for this set of movies and to have this happened makes me think twice about ordering sets again. I now have two of Sarah plain and tall and Winter's End but not Skylark. My second job is taking care of a hospice patient who has never seen the movies and was excited to hear that I had them. So we were watching them for the first time today and I find this. Not happy. A big disappointment for her not to see Skylark. Sincerely Lori,1465084800,,789,4.12987012987013

1052281,5,6305613524,"Just ordered this for my BFF roommate today and she LOVES this movie series. I pretty much didn't care much for it back in the day, because I find Christopher Walken to be a very weird actor back in his prime in the 80's-90's, he picks mostly oddball, awkward roles and everyone finds him funny because of that along with his tendency for cue cards (he's using them in this series, too). The casting for Glenn Close in this series makes her and Walken quite the odd couple, too. After Close's steamy sex scenes and psychological role she had in Fatal Attraction which came out 5 years before the first movie of this series makes me wonder why Hallmark decided to cast an actress who had starred in a R rated movie that garnered some fame in a kid-friendly movie series. Ah, well...I love my lady friend and if getting her this movie series makes her happy, then I'm happy.",1447459200,,872,4.45625

1052284,5,6305613524,Great!,1444348800,,6,6.0
1052285,5,6305613524,"Love all of these movies.  They take the short and simple children's books they're based on and flesh them out into quality stories.  The casting is good, though I'm not sure that Glenn Close's hair is really very historically accurate.  Small issue though.

Sarah Plain and Tall tells the story of a spinster (Sarah) traveling from Maine to Kansas around 1910 to potentially marry a widower (Jacob) with two young children (Anna and Caleb).  It would be a marriage of convenience and the couple have many challenges adapting to each other and for Sarah in particular dealing with living on a farm, far from her beloved sea, and with a man who is still obviously in love with his dead wife.  Will Sarah choose to stay, or will she go back to Maine?  But despite all the problems, true love does triumph in the end.

Skylark is the story of Jacob and Sarah settling into married life, only to be hit with a new struggle: a drought that jeopardizes their farm.  When things get really bad, Sarah takes her stepchildren to visit her old home and family in Maine, while Jacob stays behind on their farm in Kansas.  Will it ever rain again?  Will Sarah and the children go home or stay in Maine?

Winter's End begins with the arrival of a stranger to the family's Kansas farm--who at first is seen only by the family's youngest child, Cassie (Jacob and Sarah's child together).  It turns out to be Jacob's father, who abandoned his family when Jacob was a young child.  While Sarah and the children start to welcome this long-lost relative, Jacob is bitter and resentful.  But will Jacob change his views when several near-catastrophes give his father a chance to help and prove he's changed?

*One thing that I really think is neat about this series of movies is the fact that scenes from all of them were filmed at the Cowtown living history museum in Wichita, Kansas.  That's near where I grew up and where I attended some summer scouting day camps at the museum.",1444262400,6,1961,4.589080459770115

1052739,3,6305613524,"Pretty basic Hallmark entry is likely more known today due to the somewhat notoriety of the books and the TV special's two lead actors, Glenn Close and Christopher Walken. Like most of the Hallmark specials, this one is not much different in its attempt at sentiment over character study. I would say this is fine for family viewing, but not much too chew on for the more sophisticated adults. Paradoxically, the followup, ""Skylark"", is actually much better. This may have had something to do with the director on that one. Where TV director, Glenn Jordan, helmed this one, the film director, Joseph Sargent, landed ""Skylark"", which was likely the reason for the difference.",1421712000,,674,4.9734513274336285

At the end of the first two one wants more of the story! That is what you get in the next two movies and you start to feel like you know this family. We all can relate on one level or another to the struggles that this family goes through. They stick it out and their love grows stronger.

1053096,5,6305613524,"It's a Hallmark film, ergo -family oriented. The Sarah, Plain and Tall trilogy is a beautiful collection of three films (Sarah, Plain and Tall; Skylark and Winter's End) about a woman, who answers a personal ad from a widower with two children in Kansas. She travels with her cat, Seal, from the lush greeness and crystal waters of Maine, to a wind blown, prairie farm in Kansas, after corresponding with him. The agreement is she will visit for a month and in that time all will see if there is basis to create a family unit that will work.  This film is epic in its story line- In Sarah, Plain and Tall we experience how the death of Jacob's first wife still haunts him; the young children, trying to retain their mother's memory and still have room and love for Sarah and Sarah trying to adjust to the harshness of Kansas in respect to the openess of Maine and the sea. The film moves on to two other chapters in their lives: Skylark and Winter's End. In each segment time has past and the children are grown by the third segment. Each film presents a realistic view of life and how old memories and aspects of the past shape the personalities of the characters and their abilities to cope with their daily joys and sorrows. I enjoyed it and never tire of watching this trilogy of films. Glenn Close and Christopher Walkin are superb and very believable in their roles.

Happily ever after doesn't come easy to this farm family, but they all find they can get there. The lesson of learning to love and to make a difference wherever we find ourselves shine through in this wholesome and lovely story. Despite giving up a life that most would consider ""better"", Sarah chooses to give herself fully to those who need her, resulting in a wonderful turnaround in their lives. I laugh every time I see this movie because, having tried a more self-sufficient lifestyle, and found the result wasn't worth the extra work for me, I am still intrigued by the thought of a simple farm life which holds such a simple appeal in movies like this. While the farm life is definitely not glamorized here, its strengths definitely shine out in the movie. Moreover, placing the needs of others above our own and doing the right and loving thing even when it is difficult and odds seem stacked against us are gentle threads which weave this movie together.",1395619200,3,1052,4.6310160427807485

1053479,5,6305613524,"I am only reviewing the first movie. I have not seen the other two.

I have not read Patricia MacLachlan's Sarah, Plain and Tall but this movie really makes me want to.

Glenn Close gives a beautiful, sensitive portrayal of Sarah Wheaton, a strong, devoted woman who accepts a position as a housekeeper to Jacob Witting, a Kansas farmer. She brings a quiet, subtle strength to the role which makes her very endearing and was well-nominated (although she didn't win them) for a Best Leading Actress in a TV Mini-Series Golden Globe and Emmy.

Her character reminds me a little of Maria in The Sound of Music. Even though their personalities are different (Maria is bubbly, flighty and outspoken and Sarah is more quiet and stoic) both women accomplish basically the same goal--the woman who helps the widower and his children appreciate the joys of family life again. Yes, the romance between her and Caleb is predictable but it develops so slowly and gradually that it feel real. They are both stubborn, strong-willed people but you can tell that deep down they admire and respect each other despite not always seeing eye to eye.

The screenplay does an excellent job fleshing out the personalities of the two adults and children and contains plenty of dialogue crackling with wit and spark.

I recommend this movie. Definitely the warm, pleasant, feel-good type.",1374969600,,1363,4.908695652173913
1053480,5,6305613524,"Glenn Close is such a marvelous actress that no make-up artist can possibly make her look ""plain."" The trilogy by author Patricia MacLachlan is excellently written and acted. I wish all families in all countries were required to watch the three DVDs to see how families who love and respect each other work, laugh, and love together.
Ms. MacLachlan must have had Glenn Close in mind as the person who would so beautifully bring Sarah to life. These DVDs are the ones I turn to when I want to escape the selfish and thoughtless and even criminal acts that seem to occur so often in the current time.
Thank you to Ms. MacLachlan for writing such beautiful stories and to Ms. Close, Christopher Walken, their children, Jack Palance, ""The Three Treasures,"" and the rest of the cast for giving us such significant inspiration.",1374796800,3,821,4.748251748251748

1053622,5,6305613524,"This is a trilogy, 3 movies of 100 minutes each, 5 hours in all (in English, NO subtitles - 'Product Details' claims English subtitles - it is not so!):
1) 'Sarah Plain and Tall'
2) 'Skylark'
3) 'Winters End'

On IMDB the trilogy has 7 stars (max. rating) and it has 9 Emmy and Golden Globe nominations!
Originally made for television by Hallmark in 1991.

Glenn Close is carrying the movies, well supported by Christopher Walken.
Glenn Close is acting brilliantly, as usual, giving substance and character to Sarah Wheaton, a Maine single woman, responding to an advertisement for a wife and mother to widowed Jacob Witting (Christopher Walken) and his two children on a farm in Kansas.
The story is set in the period 1910 - 1918.

1) 'Sarah Plain and Tall' is centered around the relationship of Sarah and Jacob, who can not let go of his dead wife, but ends up loving the headstrong Sarah after all.
The movie ends with their marriage, that would not have come about, had it not been for the two children that Sarah came to love and can not abandon without a fight.

2) 'Skylark' is centered around a prolonged drought, that causes Kansas farmes severe hardship, causing many to leave their land to try their luck elsewhere.
Jacob is bound to his land though and can not give it up. He sends Sarah and the children back to Maine, back to the sea, to the lush greenery, to the three spinster aunts - 'the unclaimed treasures' - who walk about barefoot and goes skinny-dipping in the sea at night.
Sarah discovers she is pregnant and is later joined by Jacob, who can leave Kansas for a while, after the rain has finally come to the farm.
The movie ends with the family going back to Kansas.

3) 'Winters End' is centered around a terrific Kansas winter and the return of Jacob's father, believed dead since Jacobs childhood. It proves that the father actually left Jacob and his mother, who were estranged by bitternes and the hardship of life on the farm.
The father, who is seriously ill, perhaps dying, is finally forgiven by Jacob and the family united.

It sounds simple, even banal - perhaps it is; but the story, the acting and the filming makes it into a riveting experience about life, love, endurance and humanity...
These are the kind of movies that grow on you, that it is hard to forget - the sheer humanity, the pain and the joy!
I don't know if this kind of movies are made any longer, or if it has all gone up in rattling guns, murder, special effects and extravaganzas - if movies like these are not made, it is a loss and a pity!
One to watch!",1342224000,,2563,4.477516059957173

I've seen all three movies on TV several times, but the televised image quality wasn't great.  Getting them on DVDs resulted in better images.  All three movies are in the old 4:3 format - but the old format contains more detail in the images since they haven't been cropped to fit the HD format.
As usual, Hallmark DVDs have a few more scenes than the movies that have been televised.  Not critical scenes, but they do help round out the stories.

We would listen to the audio tape read by Glenn Close herself, taking all the characters parts but changing her voice slightly for each one. Then as a concluding activity, we would watch the DVD. What a precious, precious story. If I remember correctly it is only about 63 pages long, but the dialogue is beautiful yet simple. It is somewhat of a lost art to read with expression. This book, DVD and audio can show a young child or an old one, the art of  reading with expression. I am planning on buying all three (book, DVD, and audio) for my nine year old niece for Christmas. It is a gift that I feel, she will truly remember. I also plan on exposing my three grandsons (ages: 5, 4, and 3) to the three venues.

I introduced my husband the series and he thought they were pretty good. I particularly enjoy watching Christopher Walken's performance as the husband. ""Dammit Sarah, they're not pets! We live by them!"" But this is a great window into the struggles of living on a farm, and in a different era. The values and emotions ring true. All in all a wonderful, enriching entertainment experience. And you don't have to be worried about children viewing this series, there are good things instilled by this story, not junk like most of the ""Family"" features marketed today.",1242345600,2,722,4.784
1053991,4,6305613524,"I bought this DVD after my 10 yr. old fourth grade daughter read the book in school and then watched Sarah Plain and Tall movie in school as well. Prior to that, I had never heard of it nor do I receive the Hallmark Channel, which produced it.  My daughter mentioned how much she liked the movies and wished she could see it again (without interuptions since she watched it in school over a series of several days). She said that she had been told there were two more stories (also two other books) and wished she could see them as well.  Thus, I researched the film to discover that it is currently out of print.  However, it was available from Amazon's marketplace.  It was a big decision, because I had to pay quite a bit more than what it was originally priced.  Since we only recently received it, I have only seen Sarah Plain and Tall and not the two others yet.  I hope to see them soon.  I'm therefore, giving the movie(s) 4-stars because of having to pay such a high price.  However, it is really a 5-star movie for the whole family to watch.",1240099200,,1051,4.299492385786802
1053992,5,6305613524,"This is a heartwarming, favorite movie collection of mind, about a love between two wonderful people, Jacob and Sarah, and Jacob's children, Anna and Caleb. Jacob and Sarah's love withstood the test of time!

 Sarah a mail-order bride who lived by the sea, where there is always plenty of water, and green grass. Sarah answered Jacob's advertisement for a wife, to help him with his two children, and his farm.( I loved the hand written letters in these movies!) Jacob and his family lived in a dry place, with brown grass, and not much water, so it was a big change for Sarah, and also for Jacob, because Sarah was strong willed, and had a mind of her own, and Jacob was used to having things his own way!

 I highly recommend this movie collection! I saw it years ago and I loved it! My favorite ones of the collection was Sarah Plain and Tall, and Skylark! I loved the adorable barefooted treasures! Jacob, in these movies was a man after my own heart!",1234051200,,955,4.471264367816092

I will not go into what the story line is about as many other reviews have done that already but what I will say is this.
These movies are the best non Christian movies in my opinon ever made. Sarah Plain and Tall movies focus on the importance of family, forgiveness,healing,love....I could not praise these productions enough and if I could give more then 5 stars I would.
If you are looking for clean wonderfully made productions to add to your collection that the whole family can enjoy both young and old. This collection of movies would fit the bill.",1183939200,2,795,4.414965986394558

Lose yourself in the world of droughts, fires, children, animals, farm work, and love.  I cannot recommend these movies to do them justice.  Wonderful.  Exciting.

1054078,1,6305613524,"Sarah Plain and Tall, the book, is beautifully written. It's Hallmark ""Made for TV"" movie adaption does not live up to it's book's glory. I am not impressed with this movie. My little girl, whom I homeschool, watched this movie and said that she hated it because, ""They [the children] didn't look like they did in my head!"" The two others weren't any better. I am extremely dissapointed with the casting. The worst part about it is that it's not told from Caleb and Anna's point of view, which is what makes the book what it is. I have to say this to anyone who's thinking about seeing these movies, DON'T!!",1141257600,4,607,4.4774774774774775
1054079,5,6305613524,"This is excellent family viewing.  It gives one a sense of how tough it was to grow up in the 1800's and early 1900's. People had to work hard for everything, certainly much different than our world where people are pampered by modern-day conveniences.
Glenn Close is one of the great actresses of all time, no question here.  If you like Close, check out her excellent performance in ""World According to Garp.""  She is also capable of playing evil as well...in ""Fatal Attraction.""
Watching the Sarah Plain and Tall series is a great way to help your family grow closer together.

You watch the kids grow up and there are these marvelous stories and it's just good entertainment.  Sarah comes to Kansas to marry a widower farmer to ""make a difference"" to him and his two children.  The first movie concerns their meeting and eventually marrying, the second movie shows their life through a drought and forced separation and the third brings them into WW1 and some personal family problems.  Everything is done perfectly and you'll enjoy these time and again.  I've watched them all several times.",1043107200,15,601,4.796116504854369

  Glenn Close and Christopher Walken are terrific together. The emotions and expressions of love are so pronounced. Excellent performances by Chris Bell and Lexi Randell. It is amazing to see the last video, Winter's End, and how the kids are all grown up. Time does march on.",1028160000,7,553,4.63265306122449

Glen Close and Christopher Walken were Sarah and Jacob. I was is awe just watching Christopher Bell at his age being such a convincing young actor and Lexi Randall the perfect sister and replacement mother. The Story takes place in 1910 Kansas. Jacob who has been widowed for 6 year places and add for someone to come live with them to ""make a difference"", which a young woman from Maine Glen Close answers.  Young Anna (Lexi Randall) does not want a new mother but Caleb (Christopher Bell) falls in love with Sarahs letters before she arrives. Not ever reading the books the movies were excellent.  I found only one discrepancy in the second and third movies where in Skylark Jacob talks about how he and his brothers and sisters would talk about better times but mostly owning there own land.  In Winters end, Jacobs speaks as if he is an only child. Other than that, these are must see, must own videos that you will watch over many times and enjoy introducing them to your grandchildren.",986688000,7,1134,4.490291262135922
