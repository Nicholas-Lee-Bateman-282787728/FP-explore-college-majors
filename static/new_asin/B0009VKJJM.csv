8067449,2,B0009VKJJM,"There are 6 discs but five of them are ""documentaries"". Only one, disc 4 about Mary, is a movie. IT IS QUITE GOOD. The others steal scenes from the other discs and reuse them. They leave out more than they cover, for example, the disc ""the apostle Paul"". When Paul had his ""Damascus road"" experience, he was alone, when the Bible says he was with others. It only had a tiny bit of what happened which left out many of the things like the sheet from heaven.
  If you like documentaries you might like some of these but I didn't",1392422400,2,526,4.25
8067450,4,B0009VKJJM,"It did not completely follow what I know is to be ""true""; but it does what the word says, that the truth will be verified with two or three sources.  They did that for me.
So, it served it purpose...thank you

Do you have the book, People of the Bible where more specific information is given concerning verifiable dates?  And there is one more request;  The society of the order of the Jesuits?  It is a cover that is red in color and has a swastika on it.  I would appreciate your help in my search for these books
Thank you",1382572800,,526,4.158415841584159
8067451,5,B0009VKJJM,This video is excellent.  It is entertaining and authentic.  I have checked details and it seems to be Biblically correct.  Very well done.,1351468800,,139,4.956521739130435
8067452,1,B0009VKJJM,"Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob & Joseph Disc no longer has the original narrator reading from the King James Bible.  Reader's Digest must have purchased this from The New Media Bible and decided to dumb it down.  The authentic music and the bible verses read by an amazing voice, have been replaced by an annoying narrator who tries to explain the stories for a pre-teen who's never read the bible.  I've been waiting 15 years for these films to be converted to DVD, and now I'm extremely disappointed that they've been ruined.  I've never seen the other 5 discs, so I don't have a reference as to whether they've been changed from the original version.  I will be buying the VHS and converting it to DVD myself.",1318982400,7,710,4.603174603174603
