8713850,1,B00WOB84DS,It was supposed to play on dvd players but it didn't.  My rating is zero stars.  I entered one only to be able to write the review.,1517011200,,131,3.814814814814815
8713851,4,B00WOB84DS,"I first saw this movie edited for television a few years after its initial release.  In spite of the cuts, it was a gripping portrayal of culture clash.  It's even better uncut with the intense performance you'd expect from Oliver Reed and really satisfying contributions from Eddie Albert, Cliff David, and especially Louise Sorel.  The format won't play on my DVD player but I can watch it on a (dedicated) computer.  Be careful if you do this because your computer can be permanently affected.",1479859200,,496,4.869047619047619
8713852,5,B00WOB84DS,"This video is a realistic, engaging, and motivating story about teens and young adults dealing with unintended pregnancy, alcohol abuse, and sexual decision making.  It's entertaining and educational without being preachy.  As a professional sex educator I highly recommend it.",1465516800,,277,5.9

8713855,5,B00WOB84DS,"This is a five-star DVD of a three-and-a-half (well, maybe four) star movie -- and one I've waited decades to see, as it was suppressed by the censors for two years after completion in England (despite such high-powered names behind its production as the actors Peter O'Toole and Jack Hawkins) and was barely ever seen in the United States . It should be noted that this review is based SOLELY on the standard DVD disc in the package (I've not made the leap to Blu-Ray yet); and played on an all-region player (which you will need in the United States to enjoy this release). That said, the BFI have done a fine job of restoration, annotation, and packaging on this cinematic curio of the early/middle 1960s, the release (or non-release) history of which may be more interesting than the movie itself -- though the film does contain some fascinating (Oliver Reed) and even fine (Eddie Albert) performances. THE PARTY'S OVER was the ""white whale"" of Guy Hamilton's filmography, shot in 1963 and unreleased in any form until 1965 -- by which time the filmmaker and the producers had taken their names off of the recut, censored version -- a blank space in terms of accurate information, release history, and official acknowledgement, and even the version here, based on a non-censored pre-release cut of the movie, has to acknowledge the lack of the imprimatur of Guy Hamilton.

The plot concerns a spoiled American girl (Louise Sorel, in her movie debut) who has fallen in with a pack of British beats -- mostly frustrated middle-class poseurs -- and doesn't want to return to her life in the American mid-west as the daughter of a wealthy industrialist (Eddie Albert, who doesn't show up till the second half of the film); between her dalliances with de facto group leader Oliver Reed and others, as they pursue their lives of non-conformist decadence, she manages to elude the pursuit of her fiance (Clifford David), who has shown up in London to bring her home. The not-so-merry chase on which she leads him ends in her accidental death at a party that quickly descends into a orgiastic ritual, literally over her dead body (the participants don't realize at first that she has succumbed), which leads to further conflict, tragedy, and mayhem, as well as a Rashomon-like series of recollections, all interspersed with more iconoclastic posturing and unwilling soul searching (plus a song done by Annie Ross, the highlight of the John Barry-composed soundtrack), before the truth -- more or less -- is known.

The uncensored film itself might make a great companion feature to WITHNAIL AND I, and I was glad to have finally seen this lost artifact of its era. Oliver Reed's performance is the most compelling in the picture; he is very mannered and theatrical, but also fascinating to watch -- he carries much of the movie, even though it seems like Clifford David gets more screen time, and it is clear that Reed is the one to watch in this cast, and the most interesting character (he isn't really attracted to the American interloper Melina, and finally indicates a real indifference to her supposed allure -- if the picture had been made and set a little bit later, you could almost imagine the Rolling Stones' ""Please Go Home"" as a music cue for some of their scenes). Louise Sorel, who later became much better known to soap opera audiences in America (and also to Star Trek fans, as the doomed Rayna Kapek in ""Requiem For Methuselah""), is suitably elusive as a callow, selfish American girl who gets in over her head with a much more decadent crowd than she's prepared to handle -- among the others seen in the picture is Alison Seebohm, whose venal hanger-on (stealing the dress and some of the underclothes of the dead girl) is a startling and frightening turn from an actress best remembered as the quietly sexy secretary in the producer's office (into which George Harrison accidentally walks) in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Other background players worth noting include Roddy Maude-Roxby, memorable as the somewhat effeminate manager of the run-down building where many of the low-lifes in this bunch seem to live and lay about; and Katherine Woodville (who, a decade later, was married to Eddie Albert's son Edward) as Nina, one of Reed's pack of followers. And those scenes, which open the movie's attenuated credits and get repeated, of this pack of lowlifes and layabouts wandering zombie-like across the Albert Bridge, are etched in my mind already.

The BFI have delivered an excellent transfer of the picture, and supported it with some related short films and an extensively annotated booklet. This might not be quite on the level of a Criterion Collection deluxe special, but for a movie that barely got seen on either side of the Atlantic it's downright royal treatment, and pretty much deservedly so, even if it isn't an earth-shattering cinematic statement or the mortally offensive offering that the censors treated it as 50 years ago.",1409961600,4,4953,4.880047505938243
8713856,5,B00WOB84DS,Another of Oliver Reed's early pictures that deals with a group of British youth. This movie was held up for release for at least 2 years because the censors deemed it showed the youth of England in a negative way. When it was finally released it had numerous cuts. This Blu-ray offers the most complete version to date. The print is crisp and clear. The scenes that were added back are a little fuzzy but have been restored as best as possible. A really good movie and I highly recommend it.,1331510400,6,492,4.417582417582418
