The wet nurse has beautiful nipples. (Just kidding!) Seriously however, the humbleness and beauty of the wet nurse seems to be the main cause for envy and jealousy from those she has to serve and work with. The victorian society from those days seemed to relish looking down on those less fortunate than themselves which in real life, isn't so far fetched nowadays as well. My girlfriend liked this movie while i did not, except for the breastfeeding part which got me a pillow right across the face simply because i said she has beautiful breasts. That only proved my point how women are jealous of other women even in fictional terms.",1335484800,,815,4.627586206896551
