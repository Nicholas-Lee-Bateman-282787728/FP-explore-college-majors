8192841,5,B000PN4U7Q,"Talcs series "" The essential of piano"" is very helpful I used them for review and usually have to wait in line when I request them from the library. His course is in demand and is actively in circulation at my county library. I plan to purchase the entire series for my collection. Great job Talc.",1422316800,,297,4.321428571428571
8192842,5,B000PN4U7Q,"I am an adult just starting out on piano. The explanations, demonstrations and suggestions given are clear and simple. This video series (I have used the first three and am looking forward to getting others) is perfect for learning the fundamentals and how to use what you have learned to make your own music.",1420243200,,309,4.7407407407407405
8192843,5,B000PN4U7Q,"I'm really writing this in response to the other commentator. Really unfair to judge the guy on his complexion and hair!  I've tried several ""teach yourself piano"" schemes in the past. A Miracle piano that hooked up to a nintendo and one of the computerized programs. I didn't advance very far with either because of the emphasis on note reading in time and songs like ""Mary had a little lamb"" and ""the farmer in the dell"". It all made me feel like a retard, (sorry just no other way to put it).

Tolchin's videos take a different approach and are oriented for adults. I was amazed at how easy the basic concept of a piano is. This is volume one. He orients the student to the keyboard. Yes, the music is very basic - what do you expect from begining piano - but it's still better than ""Mary had a little lamb"" and ""the farmer in the dell""!

I went on through vol II, he actually does show you a method for picking out songs by ear. (So then you can choose your own music!) There is more difficult work because you have to hack your way through the various chord voicings, but it is very rewarding.  I'm currently in Vol III where once again the work is in sorting through chord voicings -- 7ths this time.  But I work at it because I know that I'm about to embark on blues improvisation. I am amazed at how much I've progressed in so short a time.

If you're an adult, say 18 - 65 or older, and have always wanted to learn about piano but were put off by the note reading and made to feel childish because of the nursery rhyme type songs, then give Tolchin's video a try. And please don't judge the man's ability based on his complexion or his haircut.",1217894400,9,1653,4.248407643312102
8192844,3,B000PN4U7Q,"The lessons are part straight forward lessons on scales, chords and other essentials. The other part that is interspersed is the instructor playing on a keyboard, emphasizing timing. The problem is that the music he plays is very bad, it makes elevator muzak seem like Mozart! Also, this guy has one of the most unsettling hair cuts I have ever seen. Apparently he does not get out much, as he has a pale sickly complexion.",1209600000,,423,4.653333333333333
