8468791,2,B005ENCIYY,Although the cost of the DVD is cheap the quality is real poor. I which the Amazon would put down the name of the company that put the dvd out. Alpha Home Entertainment is know for cheap cost but real bad quality in the dvd product they out.,1430956800,3,241,4.041666666666667
8468792,5,B005ENCIYY,"Don't buy this DVD for enjoyable entertainment. I've given it five stars because it's a profoundly illuminating view of very early narrative films. It was particularly interesting to see Musketeers of Pig Alley, the first gangster film. These movies will give you insights into the development of cinema, the values of the period, and the way Americans lived 100 years ago.",1389744000,4,373,5.131147540983607
