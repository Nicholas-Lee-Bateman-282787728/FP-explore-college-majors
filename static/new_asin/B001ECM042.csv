8339262,5,B001ECM042,"During my pregnancy, I was encouraged to use natural forms of relaxation to ease tension, anxiety and stress. While attending birthing class, it was suggested that we explore music for this purpose; unfortunately,  my teacher's choice of ""relaxing music"" was anything but. This Waterfalls DVD kept me turned on to the idea with its wonderful and unique selection of soothing music. Not to mention the added bonus of its calming visuals and freedom to inter-combine both to create and set your mood. It is truly a wonderful option.  I recommend it to all moms and moms - to - be!",1242691200,,578,4.77
8339263,5,B001ECM042,"From the stunning, beautiful nature video scenes, which are breathtaking and so calming, to the relaxing and soothing musical options, I can't think of a better way to drift off to sleep or to just take a break from a stressful or hectic day. The production quality and professionalism of this Waterfalls DVD are superior to many other relaxation products that I have bought and tried. In addition to using this for general relaxation, I would recommend it also for headache relief, anxiety reduction, pain management, meditation and even for relaxation before a stressful event such as a medical procedure.  I plan to give them to several friends and family members for birthdays and Christmas. I think it's an ideal, healthy and thoughtful gift for men or women of any age.

One of the things that makes this DVD different and so worthwhile is that you can pick from a number of different really nice soundtracks (I especially like Jim Kimo West's gorgeous guitar music and the Japanese bamboo flute but they are all really beautiful and calming) to fit your particular mood or personal preference.  It's like getting 6 CDs in one!  Worth every penny and a real gem for anyone with stress, a busy mind or a hectic life...or who just likes beautiful music and the splendors of nature!",1218931200,,1285,4.800904977375565
