8455959,1,B0053YPAUI,This movie was boring beyond belief.  I made it half way through the movie and decided to stop wasting my time.  I highly advise against renting this movie.,1371686400,,156,4.535714285714286
8455960,3,B0053YPAUI,"Too bad I am always having download problems with prime!  I tried TLA the other day and no problems whatsoever. . .After dropping my Prime membership,  I will start using TLA.  They even have a greater listing of gay movies and more current ones!",1367366400,,246,4.545454545454546
8455961,2,B0053YPAUI,"Before Picasso was an artiste, he was an illustrator.  He MASTERED the techniques of illustration before tackling the new, rare, and different, and thus gaining immortality as a great artiste.  Why don't Indie fim makers master the techniques of moviemaking before they take on the pretensions of the filmmaker artiste?  This film is tedious and tiresome, with characters that are flawed, at best, and (possibly) psychotic, at worst.  Boring. Next?",1361145600,,448,5.357142857142857
8455962,5,B0053YPAUI,"This movie shows the complexities of relationships as it pertains to infidelity, trust,and forgiveness from the cheater and the one being cheated on.  No one gets a pass when it is okay to cheat.  This film shows the unintended consequences of cheating on your partner and who it may affect.",1358035200,,291,4.8
8455963,4,B0053YPAUI,Wasn't a bad video and had a cool story line.  I would recommend if nothing better to do on a cold lonely night.,1353196800,,112,3.869565217391304
8455964,2,B0053YPAUI,"I had hoped for more - movie tedious at times, too much repetition, plot had a little merit, acting was not bad.  A bad attempt at being Artsy.",1328313600,,143,4.107142857142857
8455965,5,B0053YPAUI,"It's a low-budget production, but a unique, non-linear narrative (the elevator sequence is great). If you're looking for a politically correct gay affirmation story, you may be disappointed. If you're looking for a true story about love, lust, and loneliness, watch it. It's not a gay story; it's a story about lonely people; some of whom happened to be gay. Interesting characters; good acting, in particular the female character.",1311724800,6,431,5.260869565217392
8455966,1,B0053YPAUI,Nothing original in this  slow moving film. Some dreadful acting from the female  lead that is embarrasing to watch. Not worth wasting your time.,1309219200,,145,5.0
