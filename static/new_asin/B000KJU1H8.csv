2692400,1,B000KJU1H8,"Somewhere in this footage is an interesting film. If only the director had left his smug boomer life out of the movie entirely, focused on Sean, Debbie and their father John, and actually asked trenchant questions, then this picture would have been moving and worthy. Arlyck tells us this documentary took 10 years to make. If so, then he needs to get a job, perhaps as a grant writer as he was able to get so many institutions to pay for this unsatisfying muddle.",1196553600,7,464,4.535714285714286
2692401,5,B000KJU1H8,"Following Sean is a great documentary-- it's not one that hits you over the head with its message, but instead ruminates on life during the 60s and the passage of time. Part of it is about what has become of the 4-year-old child running around Haight St that the filmmaker interviewed in 1969, but it's also about what has become of all of us. The film weaves together the director's own life with Sean's, as we discover strange parallels and sudden twists. When you're done watching, you'll be left thinking about your own friends and family, and how each generation changes while still influenced by the past.",1170028800,22,611,4.719626168224299
2692412,4,B000KJU1H8,"In this case, of communist hippies in the drug infested Haight Ashbury section of San Francisco in 1969.  There is a 14 minute film of a freakishly intelligent 4 year old Sean and then a follow up almost 30 years later.  The problem is, Sean doesn't much care to talk about his childhood, so we're forced to hear the extended family's whitewashed version of reality.  Still, the producer did the best he could based upon the answers they were all willing to give.",1352073600,,463,4.554216867469879
2692413,3,B000KJU1H8,"The title is a little misleading.  I expected it to be how ""Sean,"" the chid of 60's hippies living in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, turned out twenty five years later. It's a good idea and as one who lived through that era myself, I was quite interested in seeing it.  There is a lot of good footage of Sean as a child and some of the neighborhood scene, including his parents.  And then later we see the same folks, plus Sean's new wife, son, his half brother. I liked all of that.

I think the problem with the film is that it strays from focusing on Sean's family and introduces a lot of footage of the film maker's own family.  We see and hear a lot about his own life and that of his wife, two children and his parents over the years.  There are similarities to the two sets of families and if this had been the intention of the film maker this could have been an interesting film but a very different one. As it is, it rambles on between time frames and coasts and the two groups of families and the generations. There are some interesting parts, including his parents'eventual retirement to a Steiner farm commune but that had nothing to do with Sean.

Some serious editing would have made this a tighter film with more emotional punch to it. As it was there were so many characters that I couldn't sustain any genuine interest in any of them.",1349395200,3,1352,4.362549800796812
2692414,5,B000KJU1H8,"Really enjoyed this work! I gave this to my daughter in Austin,Texas...she enjoyed it as well. For me...this is my generation...for my daughter it's a chance to see a slice of life in my day!",1347235200,,191,4.485714285714286
2692415,4,B000KJU1H8,"Understated, thoughtful documentary about different recent generations in America, and
how their politics and upbringings intermeshed and evolved.

As a film student in 1969 Ralph Arylck made a 15 minute short about a bright 4 year old
boy who lived upstairs with hippie parents in Haight-Asbury.  4 year old Sean had tried pot,
refused to wear shoes, etc.

Now Arlyck sets out to find out what happened to Sean 30+ years later - was he a mess as some
predicted?  Had his upbringing left him free as others hoped?

Of course the answer is far more gray and complex.  And in
examining Sean and his family, film-maker Arlyck also looks at his own.

A quiet film, not deeply emotional, but a very interesting and worthy essay about parental ideals, family, and life.",1301961600,5,763,4.734848484848484
2692416,5,B000KJU1H8,I laughed and cried with Arlyck as he created this film about his career as a filmaker and the impact Sean had on his life. Arlyck was able to do what many of us spend our whole life trying... Find the secret of how we mutually influence one another.,1300665600,,250,4.122448979591836
2692417,5,B000KJU1H8,"A warm, wonderful documentary that makes you think. Poetic and haunting, the fascinating story of Sean and his family is told with wit and grace. Highly recommended! Cudos to Ralph Arlyck for putting this together after spending decades collecting film material.",1272412800,,262,5.414634146341464
2692418,3,B000KJU1H8,"In the late-1960s San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury was the counterculture's ground zero. Filmmaker Ralph Arlyck lived in the Haight back then and made a movie about his four-year-old neighbor, Sean Farrell. Sean's parents allowed him to run barefoot in the streets and use marijuana.

In the 1990s, Arlyck returned to San Francisco and tracked down Sean to see what had become of him. Sean and his family have differing opinions on the 1960s and their time in the Haight. The younger members, frankly, don't seem interested in the old counterculture.

If Arlyck had better instincts, Following Sean could have great. He should have used his interviews to bring out the family's story and how the 1960s shaped (or didn't shape) them. Arlyck is a poor interviewer who talks over his subjects when they don't give him the answers that he wants. He also insults Sean's father, Johnny, by saying that Johnny abandons people when they become a burden. A skilled interviewer with a few social graces could have gotten more out of the interviews.

A bigger problem is that, after the first 20 minutes or so, Arlyck makes himself the focus. Following Sean bogs down as Arlyck wallows in self-centered navel gazing and boring tangents. Viewers suffer through footage of Arlyck's two sons and of his cat. The sons show the same level of interest in the film as does the cat.

Following Sean is mildly interesting. For a better look at the 1960s, try the documentary Commune.",1269820800,5,1461,4.902834008097166
2692419,3,B000KJU1H8,"The premise for FOLLOWING SEAN is fascinating.  In 1969 while living in San Francisco Ralph Arlyck made a short documentary film about his four year old neighbor Sean which won many awards.  Sean lived in a ""crash pad"" above Arlyck's Haight-Ashbury apartment with his free thinking ""hippie"" parents, a couple of siblings plus assorted visitors and the precocious child spoke articulately (and to many shockingly) on camera about pot smoking, speed freaks and his contempt for the police.  The background of Sean's parents is also interesting as his father is the son of a banking family while his mother's parents were prominent Communists active in the organization of longshoremen.

Arlyck moved back to the east coast following the success of the first ""Sean"" film but years later decides there might be another documentary to be made if he updated Sean and his family's lives.  Similarly to the subject of another well received documentary, STONE READER, Sean and his family are not that hard to find and their lives are not particularly extraordinary.  So to pad the movie to more of a feature length Arlyck includes lots of footage about his own family - his elderly left leaning Brooklyn parents, his French wife and his two college age sons, one of whom in my favorite quote from the movie tells his dad he is just ""fishing for sound bites"" when he grills  him on his reaction to the current Berkeley counterculture.

The fact that Sean and his family are currently leading pretty normal lives is interesting in itself and I wish Arlyck had been content in just updating their story and getting some of their recollections and reactions to their lives in ""The Haight"" circa the late 60's.  Yet like so many documentary filmmakers Arlyck just doesn't seem to be able to keep the focus off himself or realize that a longer length doesn't necessarily equate with a better film.",1209513600,12,1882,4.87460815047022
2692420,5,B000KJU1H8,"This is not only a movie about ""Following Sean"" but also a film about following the threads of several generations in multiple families including the filmmaker's own family. If there was anything wrong with this film it is that it had to end. There is still so much we want to know about the direction the lives of the various characters take. Bottom line is that this is one great film. Highly recommended here.  Nuff said.",1199059200,12,424,4.578947368421052
2692421,4,B000KJU1H8,"I started watching this documentary thinking it would follow the life of a boy called Sean.  The scenes of Sean's earlier life were too short. I did not learn very much about his young life except for the facts that he went barefoot and smoked dope. The director put too much about himself and his family into the film.  I would have liked to see interviews with Sean's parents when they were living in Haight Ashbury and shots of Sean with his friends and at school.  There was too much of Sean's life missing for the film to be called Following Sean.  This said, however, I did enjoy this film and thought it was an excellent insight into the 60's 'hippy era' in America.",1196726400,5,673,4.403225806451613

8157558,5,B000KJU1H8,I have a personal connection to the people in this movie. It is a compelling story and Ralph does an excellent job of telling it.,1378080000,,129,4.2
8157559,3,B000KJU1H8,"One might better experience this documentary when one realizes it is much less about his original subject, Sean, than it is about the documentary maker himself.  I'm sure it started off as a nice, introspective follow-up into the now-life of the precocious little boy that shocked the nation at the time but then rather quickly meandered into the personal life of the film's writer/producer/director, Ralph Arlyck.  In fact you're almost halfway into the documentary until you even see any new footage of Sean, all grown-up and a newly minted union electrician, something that would no doubt making his proto-Communist grandparents very, very happy.

Perhaps the grist of Sean's life today didn't prove to be that interesting to Arlyck's mill, so he turns the film into a kind of reflecting pond upon which he might contemplate his own life and his failings (one reviewer referred to it as ""navel-gazing"" which seems apropos).  If one considers the reality that Arlyck's own life has essentially been one of meandering around as a professional grant-writer looking for money to fund his film-making ambitions - his French college professor spouse has undoubtedly been the bread-winner through their 30+ years of marriage - it becomes clear that ""Following Sean"" is more like ""Finding Ralph Arlyck.""  When his own father openly mocks his career choice - laughingly noting that ""every time he says cut that costs me a $1000!"" - and he actually includes it in the documentary you know at least he is self-aware enough to realize that he isn't that distant a character from Sean's rather disconnected and extremely irresponsible father Johnny who has largely abdicated his basic responsibilities as a parent and run away from what any one of us might consider a real life.

As such, the documentary is not an entirely bad one, given the context.  A great deal has swirled about Mr. Arlyck in his lifetime and it's interesting, but the freight of it carries into the kinds of probing questions he asks Sean or Sean's father Johnny or Sean's other family or Mr. Arlyck's own family.  His sons, undoubtedly exasperated by the camera being pointed at them yet again, are openly derisive of their father trying to use them to stamp more ""meaning"" and context on to his documentary.  They prove to be bad material for his introspective mood but he includes them anyway.

Still, I think Arlyck got his point across.  It's a look at two lives lived parallel and the similarities and differences between them, how one impacted another.  In a way I think Sean came out the winner in the grand scheme of things.  Ultimately I don't think his life was as impacted as much by Arlyck's as Arlyck's was by Sean's, which is certainly why he came back to do the film in the first place.  A thoughtful, hard-working, and even well-educated (he has a degree from Cal) product of a universe that really wasn't quite as bent as we were lead to believe - in fact outside the documentary Sean admitted that at four he probably embellished the reality of his daily life.  He was too savvy and funny and world-weary for his age, already, and probably said vastly too much.  In a way though that made Mr. Arlyck's career and it seems like he's spent 30 years trying to recapture the glory of it.  Ah ha, in the perfunctory details of everyday and the tectonic shifts of this cultural revolution, look at this moral puzzle I discovered!  Instead Sean turned out to be a rather ordinary person and so Mr. Arylck is found back-tracking to recapture that same glory.  The documentary ends up, then, light and moody and pensive and thoughtful about the lives threading through it.  For that it strikes me as quite valuable and meaningful and worth watching, even if it's not ultimately what you expect.",1358640000,6,3767,4.819875776397516
8157560,3,B000KJU1H8,"I like documentaries and it was very interesting to see a little boy who was being brought up in the Haight Ashbury of the 60s. That was the original doc., included. but also, this is the follow-up doc., showing him as an adult and he is about to marry a mail-order bride from Russia who ends up ditching him!!!!!! One thing is I hope he finds a good woman who loves him. He deserves it and is a nice and handsome man!",1355529600,2,418,4.109756097560975
8157561,5,B000KJU1H8,"Following Sean is a heartfelt, thoughtful and insightful documentary that truly takes a good close look at a young boy, originally interviewed in 1969 by filmmaker Ralph Arlyck, and what happens to him many years later when he has become a full grown man. The cinematography is excellent and I can see why the film won awards; it's all done so very well. (It did receive criticism, too, for showing what some people felt was wrong with America.) As others state, the film progresses at a good pace never feeling forced, too fast or too slow. It truly held my interest every step of the way! The quality of the original 1969 print is very good especially when you consider that it was not filmed using Hollywood studio quality equipment.

We see four year old Sean answering some questions posed to him by Ralph Arlyck; Arlyck had moved to San Francisco to experience the freedom loving/youthful California lifestyle of the 1960s and just two stories above him in the same apartment building was Sean in an apartment with his parents--and quite a few people coming and going with Sean's father and mother considering their apartment as ""an oasis"" for anyone who needed a brief safe haven while they were transients on drugs or running from spouses who had abused them. Sean's father teaches Sean how to use tools at a very early age and we see Sean loving it all; he's also quite intelligent--you can tell by the way 4 year old Sean answers Ralph's questions!

Ralph sensed some similarities between his own family and Sean's family (liberal parents, creativity, thinking outside the box, etc.) so quite a few years later--just about thirty, in fact, Ralph returns to San Francisco and he meets Sean again on a corner in the Haight-Ashbury district where they all lived previously. It's initially quite something to see Sean looking so different; but it didn't take long for me to see similarities in Sean's facial features and actually Sean's basic way of thinking is not unlike his earlier ways only much more mature.

For the next decade Ralph Arlyck follows Sean going through his life; we see Sean doing contracting work as an engineer and there are fascinating interviews with the immediate members of Sean's family and Ralph's family. The similarities and differences between Sean's family and life are explored along with how Ralph's life is progressing including romantic relationships with women.

It may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that is not the case. There is plenty more to this story!

The DVD comes with some great extras. I particularly liked the bonus scenes; the original 14 minute film of Sean from 1969 and the filmmaker interview.

People who enjoy biographical documentaries with social and cultural themes would do well to add this to their collections. I highly recommend this film.",1352246400,3,2832,4.853002070393375
