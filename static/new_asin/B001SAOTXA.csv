8339596,5,B001SAOTXA,"For those new to Liu He Ba Fa the earlier DVD part 1 presents challenges.  When they become familiar with Part 1, Part 2 of the form will be much easier to learn,  Excellent Demo but  2 or 3 of the movements  are done fast.  In Part 1 there are 4 sections each with 8 movements and in part 2 4 sections as well.  The 2nd half of the form is on DVD Part 2. Each main movement contains more than one part  and shown as the complete main movement from a few different angles.  For a beginner some of the difficult movements should be broken down into its components and shown much more slowly so the material can be followed and learned from.  Each movement is still clearly show from more than one angle and easily learned from with practice and effort.  The Part 2 DVD is an excellent followup to Part 1 DVD.  Highly recommended, and excellent instructional DVD,",1448496000,2,861,4.285714285714286
