2699752,5,B000L43PG6,This season has both of the Count Manzeppi episodes!!!  Excellent and probably the best season of all 4!!!!  I love it!!!!!,1172793600,5,123,4.809523809523809
2699753,5,B000L43PG6,"THE WILD WILD WEST's second year is the essential and definitive season of this awesome, super-cool show.  The series at this stage achieved a colorfully artistic peak and gave us the most fondly remembered and most often syndicated episodes of the entire four season run.  Although some first year shows benefited from the gothic atmosphere created in part by the black & white photography, the second season's abundance of colorful circuses, carnivals, toy factories, magic shows, Victorian interiors, jewel-bedecked ""aliens"", harem dancers, and many other things too numerous to list, gave us a phantasmagorically mod and pshycedelic wild west universe to romp in.  The stories are also the best in the series and the episodes as produced are each a virtual masterpiece of 1960's TV.  This is the season that most fans think of when they remember THE WILD WILD WEST as one of the most awesome and cool shows of all time.  Each season contained great episodes and all are must-haves for anyone who likes the show.  But if you only buy and/or watch one season of the WILD WILD WEST, this second year is it.  Discover for yourself exactly what I mean and you'll have a blast doing it.  The fantastic plots are too numerous to list, as are the superb guest stars(OK, a few: Boris Karloff as an east Indian Maharajah, Ricardo Montalban as a paraplegic with an impossibly mind-blowing secret, and Richard Pryor as a mute magician's assistant).  You'll experience how time travel is believably worked into a very well-done episode.  Once again, I must stress that this set is pretty much IT when it comes to action-adventure television.  Have fun seeing how fast you can pick out ""Arty"" in disguise...and...Enjoy...'Nuff said.",1170806400,47,1722,4.986013986013986

2699755,5,B000L43PG6,"Awesome!  I bought the first season set and really loved each intro by Robert Conrad.  A fan from the beginning, I never missed an espisode and now my 10 year old son just loves it so we watch them together.  The first set contains great info, like the multi talented Ross Martin was a concert violinist and Robert Conrad's Ever Ready Battery commercial which although 8 years after the WWW, he's is still dreamy.  Plus they have the interview of Red West who many know was Elvis Presley's long time H.S. friend and bodyguard, but also introduced Bob to Elvis over a flag football game.  Don't worry Bob, only the jerks were confused by your battery commercial, most of us loved it.  I'm buying the second set today and cannot wait to see the Wild West Movie on DVD.  What a great find!  Now I get get rid of my home VHS and Beta tapes where I taped off the TV (smile).  Buy this, fans, you'll love it!!!",1169424000,,904,4.333333333333333

2699757,5,B000L43PG6,"What a great show! I was a senior at St. Augustine High School, San Diego, when this

released on dvd format. It does not get any better than this!!",1168473600,12,359,4.59375
2699758,5,B000L43PG6,"This great series is finally available on DVD collections by seasons. ""The Wild, Wild West"" was one of the last successful Western television shows, coming on right as the era of the great Western TV show was coming to an end.

Its success was due to the fact that not only was it exciting and action-packed, but it was a curious meld of traditional Western action, espionage, science fiction, and high camp. It was in equal parts a product of its time as a Western, such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza,"" a semi-serious, lots of camp spy show like ""I-Spy,"" ""The Man From UNCLE,"" and ""The Avengers,"" science fiction like ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea,"" and sophomoric camp like ""Batman."" Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made a formidable team as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemis Gordon, as they travelled all over the West in their personal locomotive thwarting the schemes and intrigues of power-mad scientists and ruthless governments.

This show is near and dear to a lot of us who grew up in the mid to late 60's, and it is a joy to watch these episodes and remember that while the world was not a simple, carefree place, our living rooms could be while watching shows like ""The Wild, Wild West.""",1166486400,43,1227,4.598173515981735

The show is replete with supervillians, top secret weapons and devices that James Bond would love, and of course a beautiful woman in every episode.  How can you ask for more from an hour show.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin are a great team to watch and kept the stories fun.  This is too good to pass, so don't.  Get this.",1166140800,28,558,4.565656565656566

2699775,5,B000L43PG6,"This show was one of my all time favorites.  Combining the adventure of the old west with the marvel of science.  Artemus Gordon is far more than just a sidekick as displayed on the cover of this set; who wrote that summation anyway?  Aren't you trying to sell these box sets?  In any case Ross Martin's antics as Artemus Gordon is professional acting.  His ability to literally bring to life such colorful characterizations are a must see.

James West,the cowboy version of Jame Bond, far out shines his counterpart in my humble opinion.  Time and again his flare for always getting into the tightest of spots sets up the role for Gordon and his wonderful disguises.  Travel back into the 1870's with these two and you're in for a real treat.",1464220800,2,743,4.6183206106870225

I intend to buy both season 3 and 4 once I get closer to finishing season 2 because I want the whole set.  These are not your normal westerns of that era; nor are they, in my opinion, like the movie which I didn't care for.  They are what I love most about old-time radio and television which I have lots of examples of each.

2699792,3,B000L43PG6,"If you are a fan of the Wild Wild West you probably remember the shows fondly.  Maybe it was the quirkiness of characters or fantasy story lines that took place in the old west.  All mixed with a little true history.  As a kid my friend and I always played at being James West and Artemis Gordon.
Now for the bad news.  Except for a few really good shows the series falls to the wayside.  The stories do not stand up to the test of time.  The stunt work that held your attention as a child becomes boring and repetitive.  All the gadgets and innovative ways of getting out of predicaments now seem somewhat foolish.  The editing of some scenes did not match up and the acting is corny and quaint.  Sorry.  The series is best remembered as a fond, romanticized, childhood memory.  Watching the complete second season was a chore, not a joy.",1419811200,3,839,4.383116883116883
2699793,5,B000L43PG6,"The gadgets, the villains, the women (both good and bad); they're all here in brilliant color in the second season of the iconic 1960s TV show. This is a very high-quality product, within it are 28 episodes on 7 disks, many of which are my favorites from the shows 4 year run. If you remember the series from its original run or some of the re-runs in later years, these episodes are bound to be some of your favorites. Robert Conrad was the perfect high-tech western star in matador pants, and Ross Martin was brilliantly cast as the urbane, sophisticated Artemus Gordon.

Several of the episodes in this second season feature Michael Dunn as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, evil genius and archenemy of Wests. I prefer him to any James Bond villain. I love the guest-stars: Sammy Davis Jr, Ricardo Montalban, and Agnes Moorehead all have terrific roles in this season. Altogether, this series had everything and is one of the most memorable of the Sixties. Even the animated title sequence and theme music are iconic.

Its a shame this show was cancelled after the fourth season, accused of being the most violent show on television. Conrad denounced the cancellation initially but has recanted since due all the broken bones suffered. It remained popular in syndication, even spawning some awful TV movies and remakes",1412553600,,1312,4.878923766816143

As I watch the episodes, I am continually delighted by the quality of the picture.  I have to keep reminding myself this series was filmed over 45 years ago.

2699832,5,B000L43PG6,"Spy movies with gadgets were very popular in the 1960's.  Westerns were popular, though that popularity was waning by 1965.  Michael Garrison combined the still popular western with the newly popular James Bond and created the ""Wild Wild West.""  Robert Conrad was James T. West (note that this James Tiberius was before James Tiberius Kirk), the star of the show who did many of his own stunts and had an array of gadgets at his disposal, many of them courtesy of Artemus Gordon (the late Ross Martin), Jim West's equivalent of James Bond's Q.

One of the things I noticed as I watched these 28 episodes is that the second season had several campy episodes, while the first season was more of a traditional western.  Perhaps one of the campiest was ""The Night of the Flying Pie Plate"" where Jim and Artemus investigate a flying saucer filled with green complexioned alien females.

As with the first season, there are a number of anachronisms throughout the season.  Apparently, the scriptwriters were more interested in telling an interesting story than attempting to be even remotely true to the era.  Of course, that was part of the fun of watching ""The Wild Wild West.""  Just what interesting or ludicrous thing was going to happen to Jim and Artemus this episode?

Other episodes had bizarre themes that seemed more appropriate to ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits.""  For example, ""The Night of the Man-Eating House"" featured a ghost and a haunted house.  Travel between dimensions was the basis for ""The Night of the Lord of Limbo.""  In the ""Night of the Feathered Fury,"" everyone is seeking a toy chicken containing a philosopher's stone, which has the ability to turn things into gold.

As with the first season, many of the stars of the day routinely appeared in the series.  Among the many names is a very young Richard Pryor.  Agnes Moorehead received an Emmy award for her appearance in ""The Night of the Vicious Valentine,"" the only award the show received in its four seasons.  Some of the other well-known actors were Joseph Campanella, Soon Tek Oh, John Astin, Ricardo Montalban, Carroll O'Connor, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Ida Lupino, and Boris Karloff.

The DVD transfer and sound are even better than the first season.  The only thing I found disturbing was the extremely bright colors.  I had forgotten that when color was new television shows preferred to use many bright colors, which is another anachronism.  Unfortunately, there are no extras in this season.

Another thing I noticed in this season is that the shows became much more formulaic.  Each show progressed in a very similar fashion.  Unfortunately, it seemed mandatory that Jim West get involved in two fights per week.  Some of these fights were quite complex.  I noticed that West often seemed to be without his gun just before the fight started.

As I noted in my review of the first season, I was a big fan of the television series when it came out.  This series has aged.  I find it much easier to pick out sets, which was most of the time.  Even many outdoor scenes used sets.  Backgrounds seen through doors were often painted.  The special effects in many cases are no longer quite as special.  Yet, the series remains charming and frequently very clever.  I found myself intrigued by the method that Jim and Artemus used to get themselves out of each, almost impossible predicament.

""Wild Wild West"" has joined the array of television shows that have become classic television.  The show was inspired and creative.  The show used its unique premise to come up with plots that few other shows could encompass.  I enjoyed every moment of these DVD's and I look forward to watching them again, along with seasons one, three and four.

Enjoy!",1301875200,,3746,4.802816901408451

This season began the colorized version of WWWest and it makes a huge difference.  FYI the one thing missing from Season One set: there is no extra interview running commentary option with Robert Conrad (or anyone else) on this series.  Still, a great way to relive some childhood memories, and share them with my son.  He is hooked!  Sure the action scenes weren't exactly up to today's graphic standards (which may not be a bad thing), but the storylines are respectable and a little bit of a history lesson is incorporated in many episodes.

The second season is in some ways better than the first in that it's in color, the plots are more outlandish, & the over-acting by the guest villains is more outrageous.

I have listened to the episodes and also listened to the full explanation, and they even include a Music Rehearsal in which you hear the musicians and Markowitz talking.

The whole series is wonderful.  I remember some episodes and even had a single DVD with 3 episodes (Grand Emir,Whirling Death and the Puppeteer) from a earlier version that got damaged over the years.  But for pure fun and entertainment, it is a real mccoy,",1249344000,,709,4.669354838709677

2699845,5,B000L43PG6,"One of the all-time TV greats, ""The Wild Wild West"" was a truly unique series that incorporated many genres within its action-adventure format. The vivid transition to color gave the CBS show a tremendous boost in the 1966-67 season. Stunningly remastered, the DVD set includes classic Robert Conrad-Ross Martin episodes such as ""The Night of the Returning Dead,"" ""The Night of the Big Blast,"" ""The Night of the Man-Eating House"" and ""The Night of the Lord of Limbo."" An affectionate nod to 007 is evident in ""The Night of the Deadly Blossom"" - highlighted by a ""Dr. No""-inspired climax. The guest-star roster rivaled ABC's ""Batman,"" with memorable appearances by Boris Karloff, Sammy Davis Jr., Ricardo Montalban, Ida Lupino and Emmy winner Agnes Moorehead. Happily, Michael Dunn returns in four of the best Dr. Loveless encounters - reaching its imaginative apex in ""The Night of the Surreal McCoy."" Another recurring villain is Victor Buono's magical Count Manzeppi, who regrettably vanished after the second season. Devoted viewers can only fathom the increasingly bizarre trails James West and Artemus Gordon might have taken if creator Michael Garrison had not died so early during the show's four-year run.",1218585600,3,1213,5.257731958762887

Wild, Wild West is one of the most imaginative and brilliant television series ever made. I tip my hat to the producers, writers, actors, and stunt people on this show who made Wild Wild West the most successfully executed cross genre television programs of all time. In lesser talented hands, a series attempting to merge Science Fiction and the Western would have been an unprecedented disaster. Thankfully for us Wild Wild West fans, the right people came along at the right time in the mid-1960s, and merged Science Fiction and the Western into the most flawlessly and brilliantly executed genre series of all time. Wild Wild West has not one fault in it, not one. And as this second season proves, Wild Wild West is a non-stop roller coaster ride of brilliance, fun, and non-stop entertainment. Special merit must go to Robert Conrad and Ross Martin who really nailed their characters down by the time the second season rolled around. These guys will convince you that they have been friends within the framework of the series for years. Their chemistry is effortless. Special merit must also go to Michael Dunn, who as evil Miguelito Loveless, took the audience along for one heck of a journey as he unleashed one Jules Verne-esque Death Trap after another on West & Gordon.

I appreciate the TV shows of that era where a family could gather around and not worry about what might pop up on the screen and be inappropriate for the kids. OK, maybe I need to explain why Jim is always kissing women and has his shirt off to my younger ones, but that's not too rough. I have nights where I put in an episode from either the 1st or 2nd DVD collection and my 5 kids gather and we have a light hearted romp with a good show that has something for each of them to have fun with. It's great to hear them ooh and ah the way I did, and still do. It's also great that I introduced them to a cool show for a change instead of me trying to figure out what they were watching and if they should be in the first place.

The first set was very good. But I do prefer the color over B&W and the characters are more developed. I did like the extras in the first set and it made quite a difference in the total package. The second season is straight to the point with all of the episodes reproduced perfectly. Another reason I'm glad I have both sets.

In the second season, the direction of the show is established and a formula and chemistry are apparent. There are also some great guest stars and it's cool to see them portraying a villian. There are some episodes in this set which are the ones I always think of in the series. Some strong stories and action with all the classic interaction between Jim and Arte, the gagets and the fun (admitingly campy) feeling of the classic shows of that era.",1178841600,5,1615,4.0754716981132075

Can't get too 'out there' for me.  The only drawback is the lack of extras, as I had gotten a big kick out of Robert Conrad's episode 'previews' from season one.  Overall though, you can't go wrong if you're a fan.  I find myself enjoying these shows at age forty-four just as much as when I was a kid of twelve or thirteen.

2699890,5,B000L43PG6,"The second season (1966-67) of this CBS classic, its first filmed in color by ace cinematogtapher Ted Voigtlander and production designer Al Heschong, was the year in which all of the series' phantasmagoric pieces came together: high concept, fantasy, and Saturday-morning serial thrills. The show's stars, Robert Conrad and Ross Martin, hit their stride collaboratively and singly, with Conrad's unbelievable stuntwork and Martin's comic, undercover characterizations. Because the show had by now achieved a certain cachet, ""West"" attracted a Who's Who of 60s character actors, including John Astin, Ed Begley, Hazel Court, Boris Karloff, Ida Lupino, Ricardo Montalban, Carroll O'Connor, Leslie Parrish, Nehemiah Persoff, Mala Powers, Vito Scotti, Karen Sharpe, and William Windom. Michael Dunn returned four more times as arch-nemesis Dr. Miguelito Loveless; Victor Buono presided over two memorable episodes as Count Carlos Manzeppi; Agnes Moorehead took home the series' only Emmy for her starring turn in ""The Night of the Vicious Valentine."" Highlights of the season include ""The Night of the Returning Dead,"" a haunting tale of guilt and justice with guest stars Sammy Davis, Jr., and Peter Lawford; ""The Night of the Man-Eating House,"" a full-throttle ghost story starring Hurd Hatfield; ""The Night of the Surreal McCoy,"" one of the series' sheerest flights into fantasy. Much of this season's joy lies in watching its scriptwriters lovingly pretzel classic movie premises to fit ""West""'s format: ""Frankenstein"" (""The Night of the Big Blast""); ""The Wolf Man"" (""The Night of the Wolf""); ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (""The Night of the Raven""); ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (""The Night of the Flying Pie Plate""); ""The Time Machine"" (""The Night of the Lord of Limbo""); ""Papillon"" (""The Night of the Bottomless Pit""); ""Ten Little Indians"" (""The Night of the Tottering Tontine""); and a rollicking, genre-bending ""Maltese Falcon""-cum-""Goldfinger"" (""The Night of the Fearthered Fury""). The remastered video is excellent; the audio, good. The set's only downside is the complete lack of special features that made last year's resissue of the series' first-season magnificent. The twenty-eight episodes themselves are so consistently strong and entertaining, however, that they overcome CBS/Paramount's shameful stinginess.

This was a must buy in my household and I know others that loved the show will enjoy it also!!!,1176336000,,413,4.125

2699898,4,B000L43PG6,"The second season of the Wild,Wild West was to firmly etch its' place into TV history.

Everything about the 2nd season was an improvement on the first from better scripts,improved music and a bevy of wonderful supporting character actors,especially the villains. The show also was now in colour but for the majority of viewers this was of no consequence as it was still a black and white world.

Looking back at this show(and others of the period) I had forgotten just how many of the guest actors that would appear from week to week on  this show would also be seen on so many other shows as guests there. If you are a Star Trek fan like I am you especially will be acquainted with many of the actors and even those behind the camera that went on to play in THAT show from the Wild,Wild West.

Technically again the powers that be have done a wonderful job on the presentation of the show as it looks quite fresh and crisp. The colour is in good contrast and,as was the tendancy of most shows doing colour for the first time at that period,they used it to the max. Even the best colour sets of the /60s couldn't present these shows any where close to what we can see today. These episodes have never looked or been seen this good.

There are a couple let downs with this set that I should mention. First there is,like the first season,no scene selction for each episode. Secondly there are no extras of ANY kind in this set. It's a bare bones release. Shocking for such a popular show. Lastly where did Robert Conrad go?Mr. Conrads' rather wry but mostly dry intros to each episode are noticeably absent. He really didn't have much to say or tell but it was just a nice touch and nice to hear his voice.

CBS-Paramount video take note: I would like to see a full modern interview done with any cast and/or crew still with us who appeared on the show,and especially Mr. Conrad, included on seaon three or four of this series. I haven't seen this actor for years and it would be nice to hear his thoughts on the show and also catch up with him and his life today.

In conclusion this season was to prove to be The Wild,Wild West at the height of its' popularity and guarantee its' place in TV History. As I noted in my Season one review Mr. Martin was to eventually be plagued with health problems which would  take him out of the show for awhile and be temporarily replaced. Show and ratings would plummet and his eventual return could not save the series in the end. However let's savour the good times which are in Season two in abundance.",1175990400,8,2542,4.382165605095541
2699899,4,B000L43PG6,"The general feeling is that the 2nd Season of The Wild, Wild West is probably the best. It is probably true. My all-time favorite episode, ""The Night of the Tottering Tontine"" is in the 2nd Season. Amazing, the difference between VHS and DVD. Paramount / CBS is really doing a fantastic job with the transfers!

But, I agree with some of the other reviewers, Why aren't there any extras? To hear Robert Conrad give some background info for each episode was priceless. I really believe that is why most people buy DVD's of their favorite shows is to get that extra, behind the scene type info. Ideally, I was hoping that Robert Conrad would have been interviewed on camera and not just on audio for season 2. That is what really make these DVD's desirable to the fans. Please try to get Robert Conrad back in the studio. The Star Trek DVD's were over-flowing with extras, why not The Wild, Wild West?",1175990400,5,899,4.549382716049383
2699900,5,B000L43PG6,"I'll admit it. One of the reasons why I eagerly awaited the second season of The Wild Wild West is to hear Robert Conrad introduce the episodes or give me a behind-the-scenes recollection of their filming. This time around, however, there isn't an extra to be found. Why? Mr. Conrad is still alive. Other actors from the series probably are, too. Why no commentaries?

Shame on you Paramount!

That typed, I have to say I love season two of The Wild Wild West. Dr. Loveless is back. So is the cadre of eccentric villains, daring (if improbable) escapes, sexy women, clever disguises, and a theme song that I still say is one of the best ever written for a TV show.

Robert Conrad as James West is the epitome of cool. His smirk, alone, is worth the price of admission. But watching him perform his own stunts (my wife just commented, ""He has some amazing upper-body strength"" as she watched him pull himself up a rope with a grappling hook on the other end) is actually quite exhilarating.

The sound quality is superb. The picture, ditto. All 28 episodes of Season Two are here for me to enjoy again -- some 40 years after they were first broadcst.

Thank you, Paramount, for releasing season two on DVD. But a big raspberry for not releasing any extras with it. The Wild Wild West is a part of American television that should be treated with more respect.",1175990400,10,1357,4.522448979591837
2699901,5,B000L43PG6,"Paramount Home Video has kindly released in a timely manner the second and COMPLETE season of The Wild Wild West.  This 2nd season offering being in color, the transfers are magnificent with clean sound, crisp color, no artifactual trash and single-sided picture discs.  A job well done!

As I have just started watching the set, it contains a couple of silly episodes to start off with, but I have finally come to the episode that IMHO ranks as the finest episode in the entire series.  I'm speaking of ""The Night of the Man-Eating House"".  The title itself reminds me of a cheap '50's scifi movie but it is anything but!  The screenplay is brilliant with a supurb set and splendid choreography.  ""TNOTM-EH"" is a scintillating story that displays the eclectic distinguishment of this series.  An excellent season set for anyones collection.",1175990400,3,841,4.914893617021277

I bought the first season and am very happy. The second season is even better and in full colour!

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a mixture of westerns, science fiction and humour. They don't series like this anymore.

2699903,5,B000L43PG6,"No extras and that's a shame but this still gets 5 Stars from me. Why? - Because the second season was THAT GREAT it doesn't need extras to make it a MUST OWN for fans of the show.  Some real classic Episodes here and in color for this season. Jim and Artie develop the chemistry that elevates this show. That along with the clever ideas, marvelous stunts and terrific art direction this was one of the best shows ever made period. Too bad it didn't run for 10 years. If not for that Television anti-violence crusade it probably would have. Long Live The Wild Wild West!",1175385600,6,570,4.377358490566038
2699904,5,B000L43PG6,"Season Two is perhaps better than the First Season in several ways. First, actors began to appear who were famous for other Hollywood productions. Would you believe Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford? Yes! and a few other members of ""Oceans 11"" as well. Great scripts, colorful sets, interesting inventions and returning criminals in the physiques of Victor Bruno and Michael Dunn. Yes, Dr. Loveless is on the loose once again in various plots. Shrinking the world's population to make him the tallest, living like Robin Hood in Sherwood Forest to fool some indian tribes and perhaps one of the most interesting is ""The Surreal McCoy"" where masterpiece paintings turn deadly after Dr. Loveless invents a way to transport criminals through them right into your room! Wow! With that kind of ability, he should have turned legitimate! Anyway, Robert Conrad and Ross Martin are at their colorful best, wearing silk vests (a great style by the way) and there are a lot of purple and green scenes used in this second season as background colors.  West can take on even more guys at one time in fistfights and continues to win despite 4 or 6 to 1 odds. So much so that Martin makes a few jokes about it here and there in the series.  The team works well together and it shows in this second season. The plots are great and the scenery of San Franscisco, Denver, and other western places make for a fascinating hour of entertainment per episode. By the way, the opening sequence is still one of the greatest ever done. An entire Lawman's career is shown in a few seconds. Karate chop a bankrobber, arrest a card sharp, surprise a gunman that has the drop on you with a back up gun and punch out a back stabbing lover before she gets a chance! Then tip your hat and walk away into the sunset! Absolutely great! Get this set, you will be entertained and it is really special in full color.",1175299200,6,1878,4.586309523809524
2699905,5,B000L43PG6,"Have enjoyed watching The Wild Wild West ever since it first appeared on television in the 60's.  It's sort of a western James Bond.  Special effects weren't all that good back then, but still enjoyable to watch.",1175040000,,212,4.702702702702703
2699906,5,B000L43PG6,"There are some negatives with this release and with the show as nothing is perfect but nothing worth taking a star away from my rating.  Few shows have dared attempt the blending of three more different genres.  The Wild Wild West was at times Traditional Western, Fantastic Sci-Fi and Espionage Thriller in equal parts.  Those few who have tried creation a fusion of all three forms have often come up with a result that was often painfully trite awkward and in most ways unsatisfying.

The more recent remake of the Wild Wild West in movie form is a perfect example of the best of intentions meeting a disastrous end.  Will Smith is a skilled committed accomplished actor but, his efforts in this picture were wasted not because of his race but because, there was an implied chemistry of weirdness the coursed through the series that his movie lacked.  Likewise the Addams Family movies while OK are no where near as weird and off beat as the original series because again the was this implied weirdness a strange chemistry the original actors had with their audience in the intimacy of the small screen that does not translate easily into a movie.

I am not a fan of most westerns, but I love sci-fi and I love the wild strange intrigues the Wild Wild West characters got themselves into.  I enjoyed watching the Wild Wild West evolve over the years.  I enjoyed all the strange villains.  I enjoyed the fights and hokey sci-fi.  I enjoy how unlike Star Trek that tried to explain so much of its technology the Wild Wild West tended to explore the sick twisted motives of the creators of these odd ball weapons.  Where Star Trek made you look at humanity as a whole the Wild Wild West made you look inward to confront, acknowledge and explore your own darker inner demons, drives and scruples.  Who among us did not if only for a few seconds ponder to themselves like wow how cool it would be to control the world using some of the wild wild tools villains and foreign powers developed.  Like Star Trek there was always a moral sewn into the plot of most Wild Wild West Episodes but again unlike Star Trek the moral was often delivered with greater subtly.  The Wild Wild West shows that man's ability to discover ingenious ways to kill versus others who discover ingenious ways to survive is a timeless battle.  The best thing is the Wild Wild West series framed its epic battle of wits in a way that made the entire experience most satisfying which makes this series a must own in my collection, that I highly recommend you buy!",1174953600,4,2532,4.56858407079646
2699907,4,B000L43PG6,"One of the things that I liked in the First Season was the commentary by Robert Conrad before each episode.  He really added to the experience.

As a Robert Conrad fan, the absence of his commentary drops my rating of the Second Season from 5 stars to 4.

2699913,5,B000L43PG6,"I have been patiently waiting to see The Wild Wild West produced on DVD for years.  I spent my teenaged years watching The Wild Wild West every week on CBS.  Since we didn't have a colored TV, I could only imagine the colors I was missing. I had no idea how much blue Conrad was wearing! The colors were so brilliant and enjoyable on the DVDs.  The most popular guest starring actors of the day made the rounds on this show.  It's so much fun to see them again so young. Victor Buono, Carroll O'Connor, Even Samy Davis, Jr. and Richard Pryor.

I was sad when Ross Martin died of a heart attack. It became unlikely they would ever do a remake of the show.  The on screen chemistry Conrad and Martin had could never have been replaced by another actor as Artemus Gordon. The movie made a few years ago was a cheap shot for a fan of the orginal show.

I haven't seen these shows in over 40 years  I loved every minute of them. I especially enjoyed seeing Michael Dunn as the infamously funny Dr. Miguelito Loveless again.  I was terribly sad when he prematurely died before the end of the series of a heart attack.

I admit, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't get Bob Conrad back to give a description of the episodes  as they did on the first season. But such is life. I am thrilled to have these shows s a part of my collection. I look forward to season three and I recommend these to anyone who fondly remembers James West as much as I do.",1174867200,4,1446,4.202898550724638

There are no chapter menus; no subtitles and there is no; ""play all"" feature. I know there are a few cast members still alive besides Robert Conrad. Whitey Hughes; (The Night of the Vicious Valentine) the great stuntman (who occasionally acted on the show) would probably provide some interesting comments about the stunts on the series. Phobe Dorin; (Dr. Loveless's Anntoinette) it might be interesting to hear from her too.

It is amazing how this triggers the long-term memory in the brain. Portions of shows that I have not seen in 40 years triggered my recollection of what was about to happen, while not a conscious thought all this time.

2699916,4,B000L43PG6,"As others have noted, this nostalgic series has held up well over time.  James West, smooth talking tough guy and Artemus Gordon, not so tough but a master of disguise, make for some entertaining exploits set in the mid 1800s.

The restoration on these episodes is excellent.  The colors are bright and vivid.  The giant ruby ring on Victor Bono's finger (very first episode) never sparkled so bright since the first day it was filmed.  Jim's blue ""Matador"" suit and Arties green outfit shine.  No artifacts are visible, this is an outstanding print.

The extras?  Well, there are NO Special Features.  I enjoyed the first seasons voice over introductions by Robert Conrad.  No sure why he is not back for this set.  Also, no subtitles are available for those of us with less than perfect hearing.

All in all, 4 stars.  Take away one for no special features and no subtitles.  Buy this set, you will enjoy it.",1174694400,8,910,4.677215189873418

And boy did the set designers have fun with color.  It's almost eye popping....One of Robert Conrad's suits was a green that I've never seen outside of the emerald city

One of the great things about owning this, is that my nephews who are in the pre-adolescent range share the my passion for the wild wild west.  I still have a hard time imagining what CBS was thinking with canceling this excellent program.  It appears that the darkness that brought us Anchorwoman Couric was alive in well in the 60's..the birthplace of political correctness.",1174694400,7,877,4.6797385620915035
2699918,5,B000L43PG6,"In the mid-1960's the Western genre - while still boasting top-rated shows such as ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke"" - was nonetheless going into decline. In the film industry, meanwhile, the ""James Bond"" mania was at its height, providing television with a number of copycat shows such as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"" and ""I Spy"". In 1965, the executives at CBS-TV gave the green light to a seemingly bizarre combination of the Western and the spy film, and ""The Wild Wild West"" was born. The muscular Robert Conrad played James West, the Secret Service's top agent, who was sent to the Old West by President Grant to stop a never-ending array of mad scientists, would-be dictators, and all sorts of villains from conquering or destroying the Western United States. Travelling with him was fellow agent Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin), West's dapper sidekick and a master of disguise. They travelled on a personal train that was the 1870's equivalent of the Batmobile, and which was equipped with an arsenal of clever gadgets which West and Gordon used to get themselves out of trouble when the need arose. Despite the series eccentric plots and storyline, the show was an instant hit, and ran on CBS for four years.

As someone who loved watching reruns of ""The Wild Wild West"" as a kid on weekday afternoons, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD sets of the show's first and second seasons. And, as most other reviewers have noted, you won't be disappointed. The episodes are sharp and clear, the sound is excellent, and the special features are adequate. I have seen a number of my favorite childhood TV shows on DVD, and in many cases I have been disappointed by how cheesy or silly the shows seemed now that I am an adult. However, ""The Wild Wild West"" is actually better than I remembered - the episodes are cleverly written, the villains (often played by top stars such as Leslie Nielsen, Martin Landau, Burgess Meredith, and Suzanne Pleshette) are superb, and the personal chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin is genuine. Indeed, it is obvious as you watch this series that these two actors really liked each other and enjoyed their roles. The best episodes are often those starring dwarf actor Michael Dunn as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a power-mad genius whose inventions (such as television!) are decades ahead of their time, and whose rage against Jim West and his ""perfect"" manly physique makes him the perfect foil for our heroes. Dunn starred as Dr. Loveless in ten episodes during the series' four-year run, and he remains one of the most popular villains in TV history. He is featured in four of the second season's episodes. The second season was the first one filmed in color, which in my opinion was a major improvement over the otherwise excellent first season, which was filmed in black-and-white. IMO, this DVD set is well worth the money, and I anxiously await the release of the remaining seasons. Highly Recommended!",1174521600,7,2929,4.846307385229541
2699919,5,B000L43PG6,"The second season of ""The Wild Wild West"" looks terrific in its DVD presentation with nice, bold colors. We get all 28 episodes of the second season included in this set. With guest stars such as Victor Buno, Richard Pryor (both in the first episode ""Night of the Eccentrics""), Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis, Jr. and William Windom among many others. As with the previous set the season in housed in a cardboard box with discs 1-6 facing each other in slimline DVD holders. The 7th disc is in its own holder.

This season features many episodes for which the series became famous. In ""The Night of the Flying Pie Plate"" Jim and Artie face lovely green skinned Venusians but quickly discover that these aliens aren't what they appear to be on the surface. ""The Night of the Rave"" features Dr. Loveless in a plan to shrink the entire human race--except Loveless who will now be a giant and rule humanity. ""The Night of the Big Blast"" features a doctor who has resurrected the dead and changed them into duplicate of Jim and Artie to kill the President. In ""The Night of the Lord of Limbo"" Jim must track a kidnapped Artie who appears to have been sent back in time aspart of a plan to change the outcome of the Civil War.

Sadly, it appears that Paramount put all the extras they're going to put out on the first set of<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000ERVJKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;This set comes without extras. We get some fantasy themed episodes as usual with ""The Night of the Lord of Limbo"" in which Jim must find Artie and is taken on a strange journey through time. ""The Night of the Surreal McCoy"" features Dr. Loveless' evil plan to transport murderers into his faked masterpieces and then use them to kill important people and ""The Night of the Big Blast"" in which duplicates are created of Artie and Jim from two dead people and sent on a mission to assassinate President Grant.

There are also plenty of episodes that focus much more on more traditional spy western adventure plots but always with an unusual twist. That's what made ""The Wild Wild West"" so unique; the willingness of the producers/writers to introduce a mix of different genres within the show. As usual Robert Conrad and Ross Martin are both superb in their roles. Conrad did many stunts on the show later earning special recognition from the stuntman's guild.

As with the first season the plots are vary from more conventional James Bond-like episodes to the surreal ones I've mentioned. A pity that no one was asked to provide commentary for any of these episodes. While most of the cast are deceased, we could have used a commentary by someone who studies TV and the impact of the show or, at the very least, someone who knows trivia about the show. I have no complaints for the most part however because Paramount has done a terrific job making sure these transfers look top notch and clean in their presentation here. I didn't find many of the episodes quite as dark here as some of the early black and white episodes of the first set.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000ERVJKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West - The Complete First Season</a>",1174435200,84,3377,5.10126582278481

Some of my favorite episodes in this season are:
""The night of the Flying Pie Plate where we are introduced to flying saucers that run on melnum or ""gold"" as we earthlings call it. They of course need all the gold the town holds to get back to the planet they came from in exchange for jewels that seem to be in over abundant supply on thier planet, and on their costumes.

""The night of the Green Terror"" where Dr. Lovless tries to hoodwink the local indian tribe into believing he is some kind of god, until West and Gordon show up to battle with the evil genius in his giant sized suit of armour, specialy rigged to make it look like he is taller than we all know he is.

""The night of the Tottering Tontine"" Jim and Artey are assigned to protect a member of a tontine which is an investment group where the last survivor gets all the money. Well we all know that spells trouble and it sure does as all the members are trapped in the meeting room of a mansion owned by one of the members. They are forced to spend the night against their wishes and one by one the members are being killed off and West and Gordon must find the culprit behind these mysterious deaths before it's too late.

""The night of the Vicious Valentine"" In this episode, the villainous played by Agnes Moorehead is running an antiquated computer dating service where some prominent heads of state are joined in unholy matrimony. These new brides are actually an accomplice in a plot to murdering them. West and Gordon get tangled up in this mess and  must come to the rescue once again.

All in all the second season has some great episodes that are sure to please all the fans of this series and will definitely entice newbies to the show into obtaining all four season when they are finally released.",1172880000,43,4196,4.5557029177718835

8160066,2,B000L43PG6,"I really like this show in BW, and now the show has jumped to color. Looks awesome though. BUT, yes, a but! The first episode with Victor Buono, awesome character actor, is not just a magician, but some kind of other worldly being, and VOILA, WWW goes too kitchy. Campy to the tenth power. Think, WWW goes Lost in Space!! I like my westerns like The old BW plots, seemed to be a little more grounded, and the BW reinforced that. I will try to update this as time goes on, but I'm not holding out for hope. I guess I just forgot how over the top and out there the plots were. If it gets better I'll let you know I was off base. I just wrote a review similar to this about Have Gun Will Travel, with a serious Paladin circling the drain with goofy and comedic 'C' Grade character list.",1511827200,,783,4.124183006535947
