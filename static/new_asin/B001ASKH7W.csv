8412092,3,B001ASKH7W,"I bought this DVD expecting a repertoire of lute music with which I'm familiar - including Ronn McFarlane's recordings of Renaissance and Scottish lute pieces. I should have realized that 'contemporary lute virtuoso' meant that he would be featuring his own compositions which for me are better suited to mandora or even twelve string guitar. As it stands, this DVD demonstrates Ronn as an accomplished lute player, but not a lutenist. Nevertheless it's worth buying for those like me who love the lute. It's such a pity that there aren't more DVDs of concerts performed by master lutenists: Paul O'Dette; Nigel North; Jakob Lindberg; Konrad Ragossnig; David Parsons; Jacob Heringman; Parkinson Smith etc. Why aren't they recording on DVD? It's a crushing disappointment - I mean this DVD and the lack of any alternatives available from Amazon.",1229817600,6,844,5.1678832116788325
