3786755,5,B001SSHPH4,"It is one of those things you don't appreciate it until you see it. When you think Disney (as a non super fan) you think of safe cute fun that is not as raunchy or slap-happy as looney tunes or Tex Avery MGM cartoons. Goofy is the exception for a reason. This is a hilarious collection of brilliant cartoons that will ignite your nostalgia like napalm and even shock you with new-to-you forgotten jems that never made it to television syndication. If you can get a laugh having a beer with friends and watching Bugs Bunny, you should grab some buddies and enjoy this collection.

If you are going to watch it with your kids, most of the more mature stuff does come with a clip of Leonard Maltin apologizing in advance of certain shorts. If you are a parent, do not consider this a matter of letting uncle-television babysit the kids. You will enjoy it more than your kids at any rate.",1367798400,,884,4.423312883435583

3786757,5,B001SSHPH4,"Summary:

This is an excellent collection of Disney shorts featuring Goofy. It is well worth having if you are a Disney fan/collector, or if you have children who would enjoy classic Disney animation. The UK Region 2 disks are every bit as good as the Region 1 versions, provided you can play them.

-------------------------------------
On the content:

The content of this region 2 DVD set is the same as in the region 1 version, which is well-reviewed and described here:
http://www.amazon.com/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Complete-Goofy/dp/B00006II6N/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358548167&sr=8-2&keywords=%22walt+disney+treasures+goofy

Briefly, it contains 46 shorts featuring Goofy alone, released on the big screen between 1939 and 1961, starting with ""Goofy and Wilbur"" and ending with ""Aquamania"". All are in color. Some of the shorts are prefaced by a ""Fully Restored Animated Classic"" title, whatever that means. The shorts are all in very good video quality with very few artifacts. In addition to the shorts themselves, it includes a short introduction (5 minutes or so) by Leonard Maltin describing the contents of the disks (there's a separate Maltin introduction for each of the two included DVDs), another 8 minute mini-documentary on Goofy's development and evolution, and one more 8-minute documentary on the original voice of Goofy: Pinto Colvig.  Also included are image galleries showing the movie poster art that accompanied the shorts in their original theatrical release.

It does NOT contain the first appearance of Goofy as ""Dippy Dawg"" (Mickey's Revue, 1932), nor does it contain any shorts featuring the ""trio"" of Mickey, Donald, and Goofy (Such as Lonesome Ghosts or Clock Cleaners). For those, you will have to seek out ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color"" volume 1 (http://www.amazon.com/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Mickey-Living/dp/B00005KARD). The shorts on ""The Complete Goofy"" are only those that feature Goofy alone, without other recognizable Disney characters.

-------------------------------------
On the UK (region 2 version):

I've been hunting down Disney Treasures collections in order to provide my young kids with the experience I had growing up watching classic Walt Disney short cartoons (Mickey, Donald, Goofy, etc.). Unfortunately the Treasures collections were limited edition and so you can only find them used, usually with hefty price tags.

I stumbled across this (region 2) DVD set (The Complete Goofy His Greatest Misadventures) for sale from someone in the UK for $10, shipped. Ridiculous, I thought. This must be a fake or a bootleg or something. I mean, the region 1 versions of the same DVD collection sell used on Amazon for AT LEAST $70, and often well over $100. How could (and why would) this seller be selling the same thing for $10? I expected that something was fishy about it, but given the high value if it did turn out to be legit, I was willing to risk $10 on it.

Turned out to be a good bet! The DVD case arrived wrapped in what appeared to be the original plastic-wrap, with the case/labeling looking very legitimate Disney. It even had the tiny Steamboat Willie hologram on the edge, implying authenticity. The disks looked immaculate and include a cardstock mini-poster for one of the shorts. The content when the disks are played is well-produced and includes the introductions and disclaimers by the Walt Disney Corporation and Leonard Maltin. This is a legitimate Disney product. As far as I can tell the only physical difference from the region 1 version is that the region 2 version comes in a regular plastic DVD case, while the region 1 version apparently comes in an aluminum tin.

Thus, for $8, I now have every single Disney short featuring Goofy as the solo star (1939-1961). Yes it is region 2 and I live in region 1, but on a Mac, one can switch the region code on your DVD player multiple times. It's also easy to rip the videos from the disk to your computer (for archival and fair-use purposes; NOT to sell or distribute) so that you can play them on your iPad, iPhone, and Apple tv.",1358467200,11,4054,5.211981566820277
3786758,4,B001SSHPH4,This movie shipped quickly and would be great if I lived in Europe! I didn't realize that DVDs aren't universal. If it says Region 2 it will not play in the US. Other than that the shipper did what they were supposed to do. Amazon is one of my favorite shopping sites.,1357344000,,268,4.173076923076923

3786786,5,B001SSHPH4,"I love Goofy - in small doses anyway  - and this fits the bill perfectly as you can pop in a disc and just watch one or two then move on to something else.

I prefer Micky or even Scroge McDuck but Goofy is fun as well.

Picture was pretty good and sound better than I expected. Price was a little higher than I would liked to see but then this was bought on the secondary market so it is what it is. The set arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

I would rate this a high 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10 - almost everyone will like some of this - some is very clever - some is just a little too dumb for me but overall, in small doses, I love this set - recommended!",1424995200,,660,3.795620437956204
