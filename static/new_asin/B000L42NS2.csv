If you want to see the same ole same ole that you can see in any tourist dvd or literature- the Cristo Redentor statue, hang-gliding, people doing the samba, a couple of shots of girls in tight jeans- then this dvd is fine but still average. If you're looking for hot scantily clad Brazilian women in little to no clothing having a bunch of fun and going wild, you will be highly disappointed. It's a basic tourist video from a tourist point of view.",1195257600,7,489,4.384615384615385
