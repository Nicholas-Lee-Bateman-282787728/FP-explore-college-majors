8362595,5,B002BZTNNC,"Joosep is the odd man out. We begin the film understanding that on a awkward basketball court that transitions into a harrowing locker room ordeal, ultimately continuing through day after tragic day as things progressively worsen. Kaspar, a boy on the in with students like Anders, kids that constantly ridicule and bully Joosep, sees this and begins developing a conscience. What seemingly starts as a gesture to help soften things with a girl becomes something more meaningful  and that should matter, right? As he says in the movie, it becomes a matter of honor. The only problem is that kids like Anders are never wrong and never back down, and they hold sway not only with friends but with an entire class.
How far can you push something until it finally gives?
There are a few movies that fall into the bullying leads to violence genre, and some are better than others. With Klass, you have some really good performances and you really do feel a kinship with Joosep and Kaspar. There were moments in the film that I did not want to watch as the other students bullied and acted out, and there were moments when I wanted to yell at the teachers and tell them to do something. I suppose that is one of many points, too, beyond the film and the violence. Sometimes things break and we see the reaction, but could that have been prevented and how far is too far?
I also thought it was interesting to see this issue presented in something other than an American classroom, with ideas coming up that I did not realize were such big deals. Another reviewer noted how homosexuality is perceived as the lowest condition of man in that society, for example, so things that happen within the movie would be awful in the states but would utterly ruin a life there. There is also the headmistress, the way teachers react, the school setup; a lot of differences and yet the same place when it comes down to it. Some of the students might have been archetypes of bad behavior, but I kept thinking that I knew kids like that. Monstrous ones pushed and pushed, never thinking anything could happen. It makes for something I enjoyed watching and something that made me feel for the characters at the same time.
Remember what type of movie this is and judge it on that criteria alone. If you like this type of film, you will enjoy Klass. If not, well, you know.",1430784000,,2348,4.563981042654029

8362597,5,B002BZTNNC,"The law of the jungle is fair and kind compared to the law (or lack thereof) of high school. 16 year-olds can act with the utmost cruelty and viciously attack their peers. Contemporary psychologists call this phenomena bullying. And that's exactly what Joosep is struggling against. He's constantly bullied by a group of abusive boys that act under the guidance of Anders, the alpha male, the ultimate bully.

When the boys assault Joosep in the locker room and remove his clothes, leaving him completely naked, Kaspar, a boy that was part of Anders's circle rebels against the abuse and saves Joosep from further mortification. Kaspar then embarks upon an almost impossible task, after all, he is an idealistic adolescent fighting against an abstract threat. He can fend off Anders for a while, but he cannot neutralize bullying as a continued and ever increasing practice in high school.

Anders ridicules Joosep persistently, accusing the defenseless boy of being gay. It doesn't matter if Joosep is gay or not, the important thing is that Anders behaves like every other uncouth teen in the world: he relies on the homosexual phantasm in order to articulate himself in the symbolic order and, more accurately, in a place of power within the lawless dynamic of high school.

Homosexuality is seen as a synonym of the abject, id est, the vilest, the very lowest condition of man. That's why it's also the most common insult among teens in Western (and perhaps Eastern) society. According to contemporary philosopher Slavoj Zizek in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essential-Zizek-The-Complete-Set-The-Sublime-Object-of-Ideology-The-Ticklish-Subject-The-Fragile-Absolute-The-Plague-of-Fantasies-4-books/dp/1844673278/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essential Zizek: The Complete Set (The Sublime Object of Ideology, The Ticklish Subject, The Fragile Absolute, The Plague of Fantasies: 4 books)</a>, we should ask here a naive, but nonetheless crucial question: why does the Army so strongly rejects gays? For Zizek, there is only one possible consistent answer: not because homosexuality poses a threat to the `phallic and patriarchal' libidinal economy of the military community, but, on the contrary, because the Army itself depends on a disavowed homosexuality as the key component of the soldiers' male-bonding.

In fact, in any phallocentric society there will be a constant and insatiable need to humiliate the one who is different, the one who doesn't act as virile or as manly as he should. And if there is no such person then every group of men will create this figure, even if it's as a purely phantasmatic projection of their own fears and insecurities. This of course pertains to high-school, after all, adolescence is a difficult age in which the subject must reaffirm both sexual identity and gender role, something that is made all too clear in ""Klass"".

This flimsy concomitance of extreme and violent homophobia with thwarted (id est, publicly unacknowledged, `underground') homosexual libidinal economy, bears witness to the fact that the discourse in high school can function only by censoring its own libidinal foundation. That's why it's impossible for the boys to divulge what is really going on in their lives: they cannot talk to their parental figures or teachers simply because the underlying social structure cannot be interpreted through language. What goes on in their lives is far more complex than simple aggression. It's not a matter of fists, but minds.

When Kaspar decides to help Joosep, his other relationships start to disintegrate. Once a popular boy, Kaspar is now labeled as a pariah, joining Joosep in the murky confines of the land of the ""losers"" (it's fascinating to observe that this dichotomy between popular kids and losers exists not only in the US but also in Estonia). Thea, Kaspar's girlfriend, soon loses her patience. Why is he defending this pathetic, antisocial boy? For Kaspar is a matter of honor, is a matter of standing up and fighting against an unfair situation. If Anders represents power, Kaspar is the heroic resistance. Resistance is immanent to Power; although in the case of sexuality the disciplinary `repression' of a libidinal investment eroticizes this domination attempt. This is why Anders is completely obsessed with the alleged homosexual condition of Joosep. Although very subtly, Ilmar Raag's film presents a homophobic that could perfectly be a (very furious and frustrated) closeted homosexual. Anders also hates Kaspar because he's dating a girl, and he's man enough to defend his beliefs.

Anders displays an obsessive behavior that obtains libidinal satisfaction out of the very compulsive rituals destined to chastise gays. That's why when he fails to create the phantasy of homosexuality through an elaborate scheme of false e-mails sent to Kaspar and Joosper he chooses a more radical approach. A very typical masculine ritual is the practice of hazing -a ceremonial beating up or a humiliation of sorts. Should this practice be publicly disclosed the very dynamics of the heterosexual normativity would be undermined. Because to consider themselves as straight guys, these boys must depend on the mechanism of self-censorship: a mechanism which is effective only insofar as it remains in secrecy. Hazing seems to be accepted by teachers or parents as long as no one outside school finds out about them. That's why in sports class no adult seems to worry about Joosep getting punched. In the same way, Joosep's father gets mad at his son, not because of the hazing but because the hazing has escaped the boundaries of school and has reached their house. The rule is simple: violence can take place as long as it's not discovered.

Anders's new trap seems to work at first, when he captures Joosper and Kaspar in the beach. There, he menaces both with a knife; he then proceeds to put Kaspar on his knees and forces him to receive Joosep's penis into his mouth... while filming everything with a digital camera. The hazing, of course, nowadays can be perpetuated through YouTube, Facebook or any other social network. Anders has planned to destroy the two boys, to make them feel so ashamed that they must either leave the school or commit suicide. But his plan has one error: as it has been stated, once these images are broadcasted online, the required self-censorship gets deactivated; thus vacating the place of power and creating a counter-power.

In other words, Anders can no longer be the leader, something made clear by the comments of the boys in his group, who feel disgusted at his actions. The homosexual slandering had been fundamental for them insofar as it had only worked in the dimension of the phantasm. Once homosexuality is embodied by the two victims, everything falls to pieces.

The Power edifice is never indestructible: to reproduce itself and contain its Other, it has to rely on an inherent excess which grounds it. To put it in the Hegelian terms of speculative identity, Power is always-already its own transgression, if it is to function, it has to rely on a kind of obscene supplement. Once Anders has degraded his two victims, he loses all power, and thus empowers Kaspar and Joosper who now feel compelled to exact revenge on the bully.

""Klass"" is one of the most honest, heartbreaking, cruel and powerful films I've ever seen regarding teenagers, games of power and violence. Once violence escalates we know that tragedy ensues. Reminiscent of productions such as Gus Van Sant's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elephant/dp/B000H1690W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elephant</a>&nbsp;or Murali K.

8362598,5,B002BZTNNC,"Cinema has given us many movies on the teaching process, with students, schools and teachers as main protagonists. TO SIR WITH LOVE, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, DEAD POET'S SOCIETY, FREEDOM WRITERS and many others, as excellent as the ones mentioned. However, none of these or any other movie have impressed me as much as this one. It's a devastating, heart-breaking, terrifying and terrific drama about bulling. As a teacher of Literature for future English teachers, I've commented this movie with my students (whose ages rank between 18 and 22) and they share a common opinion: every future teacher should watch this one. I've seen it four or five times and each time it has impressed me deeply. It's not only about bulling, actually: it also speaks about intolerance, loneliness and self-respect. Some people might find it hard to watch it due to its brutaliy and violence, but it's worth waiting until the end, though predictable. Both young protagonists are brilliant, and the direction is superb, with an intensity that goes from - to + until reaching a climatic moment difficult to stand. In a nutshell, DON'T MISS IT!!!",1317945600,2,1131,4.957894736842105
