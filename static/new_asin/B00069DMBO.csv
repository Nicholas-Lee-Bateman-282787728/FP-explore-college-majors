8040537,5,B00069DMBO,"Not everybody's cup of tea, but for me, Mr. David is brilliant and tremendously humorous. Maybe it has to happen to you, to relate. I really have no idea why I think Mr. David to be the best, and so many others are averted. . . . This set is intellectually plotted, tightly acted, and well filmed.",1448928000,,297,4.228070175438597
8040538,5,B00069DMBO,I haven't seen a better show on television. Thank you Larry David... Genius!,1439164800,,76,4.923076923076923
8040539,5,B00069DMBO,I initially rented these DVDs at a local video rental and decided that it would be more expensive to keep renting than to buy the series.  When I am stressed I sit down and watch Larry David make a fool of himself.  It makes me feel more competent and brilliant.  I find this series so hillarious that I can watch it over and over and still get a laugh out of the outrageous situations that he gets himself into and tries to get out of.  This is a series that I will keep and add to as long as I can.,1162080000,,500,3.9207920792079207

8040545,5,B00069DMBO,"Larry David addresses the everyday minutiae of life, the things we all think but never say..... You find yourself gripping the chairarms and wincing at the faux pas and complete idiocy of this man.  My sister won't watch it because she said it makes her nervous wondering what horrific thing he will do next..... which is exactly why I love it!  He completely takes you away from your humdrum everyday life, talk about feeling superior!  Comic genius at its best, clearly the reason for the tremendous success of Seinfeld, it's fresh and funny and you cannot roll your eyes enough!  Love it!!!!!!",1112054400,7,596,4.813725490196078
