8173021,3,B000MVDH66,"This is two more complete Hee Haw shows,  The first one has Freddy Fend singing Before The Next Tear Drop Falls and Wasted Days And Wasted Nights.  And also Melba Montgomery who I was never too crazy about.  The second show is better.  With Johnny Cash and La Costa who is Tanya tucker's sister.  I alway's liked her but I was a teenager and never had any money so I didn't have any money to buy anything by her.  She does two great songs Get On MY Love Train and This House Runs On Sunshine.",1493856000,,492,4.126315789473685
