4689877,5,B005G815QY,"This documentary shows the upbringing of a young Harpy eagle unto mid-adulthood under the care of his mother and father as they hunt down monkeys for him! How awesome!!!  The Harpy eagles are one of my most favorite breeds of eagles, and birds in general. A great bird of prey. If your looking for a short documentary that jam packs awesome footage of this most elusive and beautiful bird in its habitat, then this is the dvd for you. Because where else are you going to see a documentary on the Harpy eagles??",1386201600,2,510,4.483870967741935
4689878,4,B005G815QY,"Amazing documental about one of the greatest predators on earth.
As a wildlife photographer I know how difficult can be to get close to certain wild animals and this movie bring us incredible images of this fantastic eagle.",1382832000,,223,4.894736842105263
4689879,5,B005G815QY,Suburb photography that imparts insight into the eagles existence with true artistic presentation. Well worth viewing and adding to a DVD library.,1370995200,,146,5.681818181818182
4689880,5,B005G815QY,"This movie covers the powerful Harpy Eagle, the largest eagle of all eagles in the world. Our story begins in the jungles of Venezuela's Orinoco River jungle. Wildlife filmmakers Fergus Beeley covers a Harpy Eagle nest, and films a newly hatched eagle nestling, through its development, as his parents hunts and brings him all the food he needs until he's old enough to leave the nest and fend for himself.

Harpy Eagles are powerful enough to hunt Howler Monkeys, and Two Toed Sloughs. I enjoyed this movie, the look of the eagles, even the sounds they make when they are vocal. You will see how powerfully built they are. The movie is crystal clear, and the scenery is all jungle, with the sound of other exotic birds being heard in the background.",1364169600,6,750,4.681818181818182
4689881,4,B005G815QY,"I'm a birder and I love birds.  This is a wonderful DVD about the ""Harpy Eagle"" (Jungle Eagle).  We loved watching the birds and seeing how they caught the growth of the baby eagle from birth to and adult.  Our only problem at first is watching the Specialist enter onto the story and then hearing no voice.  At first we thought the DVD was broke.  After two tries we realized it was ""captioned"".  We thought being in South America maybe it was in another Language.  We watched the whole story enjoyed the photography and the hard dangerous work the men went through placing cameras up, etc near the Eagles. It did not say ""closed captioned"".
Maybe our DVD could play the voices of the people in the DVD.  They looked like they all could speak English.  Why was it captioned?  It was too hard to watch the beauty of the birds and the other creatures and birds while at the same time trying to read the captions.  We just watched the Documentary and occasionally read.  The captions went too fast because it was keeping up with the speed of the person talking.
It was quiet though the whole DVD.  Did we get the wrong one or was it supposed to be captioned?  Maybe we missed the sounds of the creatures.  The great part of the captions was they did identify the creatures!",1357430400,7,1271,4.418103448275862
4689882,5,B005G815QY,"I have no choice but to give Jungle Eagle five stars. I'll tell you why if you have a minute or two to spare.

  The simple truth is this documentary has many things going for it. As always, this Nature film has amazing video and sound quality. The story is compelling too, even more so than usual and that is saying a lot. This bird lives in hard to get to places that are in and of themselves dangerous. And the beautiful creature is itself very dangerous as you quickly find out in the film. So what really stands out even more than that? Why, the interaction between beast and man. Let me tell you what I mean.

  The Harpy Eagle, the species this show is about, is very intelligent as one quickly notices. The resident eagles in this program are aware of everything that goes on in their domain including the small humans trying to invade their home. They do everything they can to drive them out. They have no interest in them being there. Well, ok, the eagle chick seems interested. In fact, watch particularly at the end of the film for the interesting things he does. He seems to genuinely like the people. The events documented herein would seem most strange if it was not there right in front of you. Amazing I say.

  I think this documentary is yet another exhibit about why we absolutely must protect the wild places of the world. I expect you probably agree with this or you would not be reading this or thinking about getting this movie. All I can say is buy it, watch it, and enjoy. If you don't you will be missing out on something amazing. Enjoy!",1346803200,8,1565,4.36896551724138
4689883,4,B005G815QY,"No much information can be found about big jungle eagles, like Harpy or Philippine eagles. The current documentary is a rare and very welcome peace of information about South American Harpy eagle. The only downside is the lack of eagle hunting sequences in the film.",1340323200,4,266,4.933333333333334
4689884,5,B005G815QY,"This is the only video out there entirely about the Harpy Eagle so it is hard to be negative about. Science knows very little about this huge Eagle because they are so elusive. This video documents the life of a baby Harpy Eagle from a baby to a young adult. Video quality is fantastic.
If you are a Harpy Eagle lover like I am this is the video for you.
The only negative I have about this Blu-Ray is that there is no video footage if the Eagles hunting. For the benifit if the filming crew I know it is almost impossible to find these birds in the Jungle let alone document every aspect of their lives but it would have been cool to see them hunting a monkey or sloth.
Like I said this video is one of a kind. Get it !",1337126400,,720,4.006944444444445

8471355,5,B005G815QY,This video is captivating on multiple levels.  I highly recommend it. I first saw it on PBS and had to purchase it for my collection.,1445731200,,133,4.32
8471356,5,B005G815QY,"Absolutely beautiful film about eagles. Leads one to ask how they are like the primates of the bird world--or at least like the big cats of the bird world. Takes one to a sea of green, the ocean that is the tropic canopy, yet another infinity",1435795200,,242,4.282608695652174
8471357,3,B005G815QY,"Jungle Eagle follows a group of daring (or fool-hardy) researchers on a stint in Venezuela's Orinoco region, described by the narrator as an eerie place similar to Jurassic Park. Their mission? To place a hidden camera in the nest of a harpy eagle, a bird of prey so large that it habitually grabs and kills monkeys. The mission succeeds, but only after the team members don riot gear! The rest of this PBS documentary is filled with all the usual British understatements: I'm here to understand it, it's going to be so interesting. I'm sure staying close to an eagle nest in a jungle filled with army ants, botflies or vultures with a penchant for non-dead meat could be called interesting, but something tells me the insurance company will have a few questions to ask about that riot gear thing",1430524800,,796,4.692857142857143
8471358,5,B005G815QY,"Very nice footage of a magnificent, but very rarely seen animal of the tropical Americas (parallel to the bald eagle, which was almost never seen in the USA prior to the banning of DDT). Particularly engaging is the obvious compassion the investigator feels for his subjects.",1415750400,,275,5.0
8471359,5,B005G815QY,What a majestic bird! I saw one at the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise Idaho. Even there it was as awe inspiring as it was seen in the DVD. Glad I bought it.,1412467200,,165,3.611111111111111
8471360,5,B005G815QY,The nature series is a wonderful series from PBS. I love birds and have learned a lot about our indigenous species the American Bald Eagle through the Decorah Eagles web site and have learned a lot more through these informative educational DVD's. Thank you,1393632000,2,257,4.863636363636363
8471361,5,B005G815QY,this magnificent bird is so beautiful.  I applaud the patience and perserverance of the folks who spend weeks in uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous places to show us the private lives of some of the world's more elusive creatures.,1390867200,2,233,5.131578947368421
