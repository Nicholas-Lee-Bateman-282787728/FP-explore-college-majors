8330663,5,B001OJ1PPA,Even thought I've been dancing for quite a while I like picking up a good beginner DVD or taking a level one class now and again. Evey dance instructor teaches a little differently and every dancer continues to have their 'problem movements'. I'm fortunate in that I also live close enough to be able to take her classes and workshops now and again. Lana Mini is a fantastic teacher and performer.,1365811200,2,397,4.605633802816901
8330664,4,B001OJ1PPA,Made this purchase based on other reviews. Lana is very thorough and gracious in her teaching style. Lana dances in the American cabaret style. My personal preference is Egyptian a la Fifi Abdo or Sohair Zaki or the american Sahra Saeeda. Lana has produced a very pleasant practice companion for American cabaret. You may want to continue your search if you prefer Egyptian.,1305936000,2,374,4.9523809523809526
8330665,5,B001OJ1PPA,This DVD is fabulous! It breaks down the steps in an easy to follow manner. It is well worth the money. I used it in tandem with taking lessons and it really helped me remember and practice what I had learned in class. I highly recommend it!,1268697600,2,241,4.148936170212766
8330666,5,B001OJ1PPA,I'm a belly dance instructor and this is the DVD I recommend to my students. Some people are visual learners and need something during the week to practice with in between classes. This DVD is perfect and covers every movement in my beginner class. Lana breaks down everything well and also emphasizes posture! So important! It also makes a good practice companion for dancers past the beginner stage.,1253059200,3,401,4.911764705882353
