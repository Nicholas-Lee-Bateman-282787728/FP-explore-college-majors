8639923,5,B00553I2K2,Not much can be said that has not been said before its just a great and fun way to lean and build the moves to make you a confident dancer. like the others that have left reviews I also enjoy trying out these moves on the local dance floor. changing sides and moving down the line of dance keeps me focused and the girls smiling which is really what's this is all about.,1436400000,,370,4.082191780821918
8639924,5,B00553I2K2,"This DVD covers promenade + lady inside turn; then promenade + lady inside turn + guys outside turn + lady double turn; then promenade + lady inside turn + guys outside turn + lady outside double turn + lady outside turn + lady inside turn to closed position.  The bonus shows you how to daisy chain the ladies' double turns together.

As Shawn says in the DVD, practicing your control is important, and you have to do these pieces at the right time.  As the leaders, guys have to isolate each of the pieces to control the momentum and energy to make sure the lady is on the correct foot as she turns.

Helpful Hint: You need a good understanding of each section before moving onto the next one, or you'll find yourself constantly going back over the 1st section and stumbling through the rest.  Don't rush it.  In my case, bc I don't have a dance partner at home to keep working with repeatedly so I could do the moves over and over (100-200 times is recommended), I have to find dance partners at the dance halls, some of which are new to two-stepping, in which case I actually only get about 5-10 shots of practice, far below what we need in order to master these moves w/o thinking about it.  If you're in that light, I found it's better to not try and put all of the sections & bonuses in your head and do them all in 1 night, or it'll get too confusing.  Better to add each piece (or section) on different nights.

The moves were easy to share with my dance partners, they followed along nicely, as long as I guide the lady to turn into the 'line of dance' direction.  I've watched this video several times and I still find new tips every time.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone of any two-step skill.  Girls at my local dancehall have told me to hurry up and learn these moves and patterns so I can come back and show them the moves.",1376870400,,1845,4.2701149425287355
8639925,5,B00553I2K2,"In a very short period of time you complete one turn after the other, singles, doubles and partner turns.  You move down the line of dance quickly changing direction often. The men really have some great moves that build on the ladies moves.  This DVD is essential for the dancers who really want to feel and look absolutely confident.  It has the smoothest combinations.  After completing Vols 1 through 4, Volume 5 adds the step up that is just right to bring enjoyment as well as accomplishment to your dancing experience.",1313452800,,525,4.736263736263736
8639926,5,B00553I2K2,"I have just finished going through the fifth DVD of this intermediate two-step dance DVD set. This one presents several patterns for the promenade position, one of the basic positions in the two-step dance. I really liked this one as it taught some moves where the man gets to do turns. Like the previous DVDs in this set, one section's pattern builds on the previous section's lesson. And there are chapters after the three pattern lessons for review and practice and a bonus chapter with variations on the pattern lessons presented earlier. I would continue to highly recommend this new DVD set to anyone wanting to improve their Two-Step knowledge.",1312329600,,651,4.927272727272728
