If you have suffered child abuse and/or sexual abuse, be aware there are many, many triggers throughout the movie. Think a long time before you watch it. Note that I gave it four stars, which is one star more than I would normally give a movie of this type. I only give five stars for classics that have stood the test of time.

2257425,5,B000850C3C,"5 stars, not for the subject matter, but for the amazing performances of the noted cast members. I've never seen Ms Thomas perform with such passion and eloquence, until now.  The other cast members were equally compelling in their cast roles. Now for the subject matter at hand.  First hand, I have worked with survivors of sexual, emotional and physical abuse.  The goal in any counseling session is to support and assist as persons of professional status.  Too often, clients will leave counseling abruptly because the emotional roller coaster they face becomes overwhelming. Fear is very real. Blame is usually assumed by the victim. The rationale is that of a faulty hope, as Ms Thomas portrayed.  The bargaining which will not change the situation, is adopted by the victim, hoping if they improve, the abuses will stop.  Of course, that doesn't happen.  Everyday, children all over the world are molested and abused by the one person who is supposed to care and nurture, protect and comfort.  The disconnect of an abuser over their selected victims is the key which allows them to act as they will, without conscience or consequences.  In this film, the atmosphere was intense. The courtroom scenes were almost per se, in the cases I have managed professionally.  What is shown here is IMO, 100% genuine and factual.
I applaud the real-life persons who had the courage to stand up and speak out, to hold accountable their parent who was inflicting their personal horrors.  They are inspiring in the fight to pry the truth from family members, who themselves are deeply mired in abusive behavior. What a child sees and remembers, what they feel...will remain with them throughout life.
This is a brave and difficult film to watch, especially because it is based on fact.  It's hard to watch at times, but I believe it is an eye-opening story that must be told.  I hope these women have been able to move on and continue to heal from these traumas.  Their courage in telling their story is stunning.  I was deeply moved by these performances.  This is an important film for all the above reasons. NOT for children, but it does serve as a clear message to those who use their power to abuse and assault their children.  The world is watching them, and they will find no refuge for what they have done.  In time, I hope this disgusting predator is found and punished.
Let this film serve as a warning that the truth will eventually be heard.  You cannot understand it if you haven't lived it. But you can accept those persons who have survived, usually in silence.  People are no longer willing to remain silent.  Stop the abuse, stop the damage, and stop all the excuses.  Zero tolerance.  No more suffering in silence.",1451174400,,2723,4.759061833688699

2257439,2,B000850C3C,"This was an interesting story, but some of the story was not clear to me.  SPOILER ALERT.... I did not understand the scene with Mary and the father, where she said that ""it didn't work"" and she was bleeding. Why did he put on a rubber glove? What exactly happened that night, and what exactly was happening between them every night? I understand that the movie could not be too graphic, but it went too far the other way and was not clear..... And in the scene where the father banged his daughter's head against the iron pipe over and over, I don't understand how she could not have permanent injuries after that, or be knocked unconscious, or at least a 911 call..... And it was said that the children always had obvious bruises like cut lips, so if the father had such a great reputation, why didn't anyone at school or church or a doctor or family member or neighbor ever question all of these injuries on all of the children all of the time, I understand that it was many years ago when things were different, but at some point, there must have been at least one 911 call or at least one person questioning.....It was never mentioned whether the children had friends when they were little, didn't anyone ever come over? What about holidays and birthdays, didn't anyone ever see anything? I understand that the father and mother were keeping up appearances in public, but all of those small children must have cried or been depressed or acted strangely sometime because if you are beaten and raped and bruised constantly, you can't do well in school or walk around smiling like everything is wonderful without breaking down at some point.....Mary ""beat up"" her three year old daughter and she wasn't ever arrested? Mary was living in more modern times where you could not get away with that. Her husband was at the point where he wasn't putting up with it anymore, but still, he did allow his child to be beaten....One of the sisters said that she ""can't hold a job"" but she certainly looked well off to me. All of the siblings (with the exception of Mary) looked like they had problems but were still able to live productive lives.....Marlo Thomas's children were a mess but it appeared more important for Marlo Thomas to be in therapy than to get help for her suicidal and alcoholic children because there was no mention about anything being done to help them.....It was said that the two brothers got the worst of the beatings, and yet, they defended the father, but at least they could have supported their sisters if they didn't want to get involved in the lawsuit.",1417564800,,2575,4.5978260869565215

2257456,3,B000850C3C,"This movie deals with horrific situation a family should never have to face-- abuse by a parent.  All seven of the children were
abused physically.  All five girls were also sexually abused.  The mother was also a key contributor to the abuse as well
by preferring social status, and a dependent income over the welfare of her own children.  For example, when one of her
children became pregnant at age 17, the mother was more concerned about how it would affect the family in the social
circles they frequented-with the ""naughty"" pregnant girl, than she was about the babies welfare, her daughter's emotional
being, or the circumstances surrounding how her daughter got pregnant.  Silence was the lesson taught to all of the children
by both parents lest their secret come out, and the families status shattered. And Silence, not love was learned.",1401926400,,848,4.943661971830986

2257461,5,B000850C3C,"I chose this five-star rating because that is what I feel the movie deserves. This is one of the hidden dark secrets of the world today, yesterday, and probably tomorrow too. This is one of the reasons for a number of mental illnesses today. This sin is committed by someone that is suppose to provide, love, and nurture you--and yet it just destroys the prey's present, and future hopes. It literally stops your growth and sends you into a hellacious down spiral. I believe all rape victims, rapists, predators, incest survivors, and silent onlookers should all see this movie. It may help those in denial, the fearful, and the ignorant to see this for what it is--and to tell on the devil. Stop keeping the devils secrets, you are only as sick--as the secrets you keep. The truth shall set you free--so free yourself and tell it, let it all go. You may be encouraging someone else that may be suffering the same tragedy and loss. Go to your local mental health centers and get into counselling. Help is out there, this is not your fault & you deserve so much better. Amen.",1390176000,,1074,4.569948186528498

2257463,5,B000850C3C,"As this movie is factual based, the theme is nonetheless as real today as it was then.  I have had several friends over the years whom I strongly suspect were victims of abuse, sexual, physical and/or emotional.  Most of them have never admitted this, however over a period of time, their repeated actions and verbal accounts of various incidents belied it.  Based on my limited education in psychology and various jobs dealing with people on this level, I have come to identify in even more people.  I would venture to say it is the underlying cause for much of the deviant behaviors we see in the world today.  I am a strong advocate for counseling for the abused.  Though I did not suffer the physical or sexual abuse myself, I certainly have emotional scars as a result of my own parent's relationship before they subsequently divorced.  If it were not for a loving grandmother's intervention and other family members (most notably an aunt) I and my siblings could have suffered the long term effects I see here.  The movie was very raw and honest.  This is an outstanding movie and all the actors involved did an outstanding job.  I only wish more could have been brought out about the brothers as they were in deep denial.

As the story unfolds the youngest sister plans to bring the aging father to trial but backs out leaving the other two sisters confused and unsure what to do next. The eldest sister takes up the slack and continues the trial which the father fails to even appear as a defendant. The two brothers who were also suffered physical abuse turn on their sisters, threatening to cut off all contact if they continue to ruin their father's ""good name.""  The mother who permitted the abuse also blamed the daughters for all that happened to them. Even though the father was found guilty there was really no resolution. The brothers and the mother were entirely alienated from the 3 sisters who had suffered not only horrible physical abuse & incest but they really achieved very little through the courts system but the airing of their grievances against their ex-law enforcement father. All you could take away from this was a least the horrible secret was out and these 3 sisters could support each other now.

The ending informed us that congress had not yet passed the proper laws to protect victims. I got the impression that there was not much out there for the redress of grievance for victims of incest.",1380758400,,1331,4.708154506437769

Sometime during the series she became a rabid ""Feminazi"" and went on every talk show that would have her to espouse her (even for the times), over the top views. She publically stated her disdain for her father (and of course the very comfortable lifestyle her Daddy provided while she was growing up),until her dreadful TV show (That Girl), was cancelled. She then did the Hollywood Squares route of has beens and then largely disappeard.
I just wish the character she portrayed in this movie was really her and it was old (and she is VERY long in the tooth now), Marlo that had abuse heaped on her in generous proportions while growing up. Heck, Im sure that if some TV talk show paid her $300 she would swear up and down that she was indeed abused as a child growing up under the very benevolent Danny Thomas, her Father.
In short Marlo's true nickname rhymes with runt and has a ""C"" in it and I wouldnt be at all surprised if her picture wasn't next to that word in the dictionary.
Avoid this movie as watching it might actually put a nickle in Old Marlo's pocket!!",1363219200,,1243,4.504424778761062
2257473,5,B000850C3C,"This movie drew me in and held me from beginning to the end. Wish the end would have shown more of the healing process to complete the story, story but then don't we all want more from a good movie.",1362787200,,198,3.975
2257474,3,B000850C3C,"why did i get charged TWICE?  the movie completely stopped playing half way through, hit the back button to replay it, only to find out later I was charged TWICE",1362700800,,161,4.366666666666666
2257475,1,B000850C3C,"I watched it for about 15 minutes and quit.  It is not my kind of movie.
I hate the fact that Amazon makes me waste my time with these required fields.  This product was not worth my time.",1360454400,,188,3.9210526315789473
2257476,5,B000850C3C,"Incredibly deep and deeply moving.  The film tells the story of a family's dark past and seeking justice from a father's cruel, cruel acts.  There is no film like this!  Check it out",1333929600,,182,4.454545454545454
2257477,5,B000850C3C,"This is a very heavy film that you CANNOT take your eyes off.  Very engaging with more and more dark secrets revealed by the moment.  But in all of this darkness, there is strength in the daughters.  I won't say too much more, check this film out for yourself!",1333929600,,260,4.26530612244898
2257478,5,B000850C3C,This is a well done movie about an issue that needs to be addressed and understood.,1251849600,,83,4.25
2257479,5,B000850C3C,This is a great movie based on a true story starring Mel Harris and Marlo Thomas about 2 sisters who sue their father over child abuse. It's worth checking out!!!,1121299200,,162,4.433333333333334
8055611,5,B000850C3C,This film surprised me.  I have a Master Degree in counseling (mental health specialty) and I am always looking for additions to my resource library.  This story opens many insights into the world of parental abuse including the fearful reluctance siblings share when attempting to face the memories and the intertwined emotional web that makes such an effort immensely difficult for everyone involved.  I highly recommend professionals take a double look at this film.,1501632000,,469,5.3108108108108105

8055613,4,B000850C3C,"This is a very good movie regarding sexual and/or physical parental abuse. I hope that some negative reviews were based on not knowing beforehand the subject because it's certainly not for entertainment, but real life enlightenment. This type of case is never 'outdated' as one reviewer put it.  I give it 4 stars for the acting and vivid portrayal of the devastating, varying consequences to the abused and subsequently their loved ones. Denial or shutting down kills the soul, the very essence of what makes us human in our capacity to love and feel. Regrettably, movies like Spotlight highlight the ongoing problems of such detestable behavior.",1486252800,,647,5.10377358490566

I remembered it and wanted to see it again... although I remember different things about the one that aired on TV years ago... I'm not sure if this one was cut to make room for the time slot... all in all, it was a powerful movie...",1485129600,,308,4.065573770491803
