3028621,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is a great prenatal workout for those of us who want to do something, but are short on time (I have a 2 year old as well.) They should warn you that you need equipment to do the workouts, though. (Ball, bands, hand weights.) But at least I feel like I am DOING something, even in the short amount of time. (I think someone in a coma could do some other prenatal workouts I have.) The only weird thing: What is up with all the boob shots? Isn't this a workout FOR women? Something is wrong with the camera MAN!",1206576000,,514,4.099009900990099
3028622,4,B000YGGNEW,I bought this for my first time pregnant daughter. She has liked the workouts very much.,1206144000,,88,4.5625
3028623,2,B000YGGNEW,"Things I didn't like about this video:

-You need too many tools - hand weights, a strechy band, a chair, and a yoga ball. This isn't mentioned on the Amazon description.  You don't find this out until you go to do the workout.

-A partner is used in the video - not practical.  They say you can use a door frame or bedpost but I don't have those near my dvd player.

-It is only for the first 2 trimesters.  No workouts given for the 3rd trimester.

-Not enough leg workout.

-Time is deceptive.  If you do the warm-up, workout, and cool down it takes you more than 15 minutes.

What I liked:

-Good upper body workout (if you have all the tools).",1205625600,,648,4.186991869918699
3028624,2,B000YGGNEW,"I found this workout to be misleading... I was under the impression it covered the entire 9 months, which is probably my fault for reading into things. It only goes through month 6. If you worked out regularly before you were pregnant, you really can use normal workout videos up until month 6. Obviously, you can't do everything and need to use common sense, but there are plenty of excellent toning videos that pregnant women can do up until and probably even through 6 months. (For example, the toning workout (workout 2) from Shape's Bikini Body Transforming Workout was great for me until about 28-29 weeks - I modified the ab exercises at the end of the workout.) That being said, a pregnancy video that only goes up to 6 months is not helpful for people who are already fit and regularly work out. However, if you are new to working out, this may be a good workout for you and may be a good introduction to all the equipment. She also does exercises that require the aid of her trainer - not at all helpful unless you have a workout partner.",1204588800,,1048,4.463541666666667
3028625,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is by far the BEST prenatal workout video available. This is my second pregnancy and I wish this were available during my first. I spent lots of money on other videos that were not challenging enough. This video focuses on toning the areas that can get flabby during pregnancy: arms, glutes, thighs and abs with weight and strength training. These areas needn't be out-of-shape due to pregnancy. Because of this video I have been able to maintain (and build) my muscle tone and prevent the flabbiness, most noticeably in my arms during this pregnancy. The workouts are short (20 minutes) so I can fit them in while my son is taking a nap.
 I found this video six months into my second pregnancy and even though the workouts are labeled for the first and second trimesters I am still completely comfortable with the exercises. I am currently rotating the 4th, 5th and 6th month workouts.
I am thrilled that there is finally a workout challenging enough for people at a medium to high fitness level. You do need a fitness ball, fitness band, and dumb bells to experience the full effects of this workout video but the investment is worth it. My arms look great and I am confident wearing sleeveless shirts during the hot Florida weather because of Gabriel Reece's workouts. Arm jiggling is sure to be banished for users of this video.
Being in shape for my first pregnancy really made my labor and delivery fast and smooth, not to mention my recovery. I am sure the time spent during these workout sessions will only enhance my second time and provide an even faster return to pre-pregnancy form. I just hope her post-natal video comes out by the time I deliver in May!",1204588800,21,1672,4.648648648648648
3028626,5,B000YGGNEW,"I bought this DVD when it first came out and I was nearing the end of my first trimester. I was looking for something that would be fun, work all the ""zones"", and be challenging enough to give me a good, but safe workout. Not to mention a workout that wouldn't take hours to do. This turned out to be exactly the workout I wanted.

I love that there is both a warm-up and cool-down for both the first and second trimester workouts. Also, I like that they have a ~15-minute workout per month, so you can do just that or more, depending on how you feel.

I personally like the casual nature of the DVD -- like the trainer telling Gabby to keep that belly button in and she responds that it is in. :) I also really like the changes throughout the workouts from using a ball to bands to weights or combinations. That keeps me more mentally engaged.

Now in my second trimester, I do in fact feel like the title of the DVD -- fit and healthy. I would recommend this to anyone who is already active and wants to stay strong as their baby belly continues to grow.",1204156800,10,1056,4.192118226600985
3028627,5,B000YGGNEW,"This video was great for me, I highly recommend it! Because working out can be a little uncomfortable while pregnant (not being sure what is safe to do) it was really comforting to me to know that this was all safe. Being able to see Gabrielle go through the workouts as she too was growing was very cool. It was so much better to see another pregnant woman doing the workout instead of someone who was not pregnant. The trainer was very patient and soothing to watch. He was encouraging without the uncomfortable ""go go go"" cheering you typically get from workout videos. One of the best parts for me was that there wasn't the typical annoying workout music. This whole workout was not the typical workout DVD. It was a little more raw and real. I liked that. I say give it a shot. I look forward to the 3rd trimester video release. Two thumbs up from this prego!",1203638400,,864,4.40625
3028628,2,B000YGGNEW,"The description of this video is deceptive. The workouts are tailored month-by-month. The first workout is for women in the first month of pregnancy, the second for the second month, and on through month six.  So if you're already in your sixth month, like I am, this video isn't very useful.

A lot of equipment is required: light weights, bands, and a workout ball. Since I only have weights, I had to improvise for the exercises with the bands and workout ball.

Gabrielle awkwardly follows the directions of her trainer. It doesn't seem like the two planned the workouts very well. Gabrielle appears to not to know what's coming next.

While Gabrielle looks gorgeous, she doesn't smile and she seems nervous and uncomfortable in front of the camera.

The workouts are very short, and I didn't feel like I accomplished much in the 20 minutes. It was awkward to follow, not very fun, challenging, or satisfying.  I guess if you're looking for a quick workout, it'll do. But I'm pretty disappointed.",1203552000,38,1000,4.818713450292398
3028629,4,B000YGGNEW,"The exercises were great. Unfortunately the exercises only went through the second trimester. You will also need weights, a ball and those bungy exercise cords (can't remember their exact name).",1355184000,,194,5.5
3028630,5,B000YGGNEW,"I have been enjoying the workouts alot on this video and really appreciate that it is designed with being safe in mind - the extra help she receives is really helpful and something that I found a good thing.

As mentioned in the description, it is designed for the first 6 months, so to me it is not an issue that it is something that may not work at some point for me, but that was what I expect.

Overall a very nice DVD that I feel is paying attention to me as I work out now.  You may need something for the last trimester, but that is not an issue with this, it is how it was made...

Well done.",1354665600,,600,3.9338842975206614
3028631,4,B000YGGNEW,"I started using this dvd around 10 weeks and am now in week 26.  At first it was frustrating that Gabby's trainer assisted her so much & used so much equipment but with a little creativity most of the exercises can be adapted using dumbbells instead of a theraband.  Some guidance from the trainer on how to make these adaptations would be great if they decide to come out with an updated edition.  Overall the workouts are wonderfully well rounded & I think have gotten better in the 2nd trimester.  I can't speak much to the 3rd trimester yet.  It is also great that there is a new workout for each month, keeping the workout fresh.  Very glad to have found this pre-natal work out dvd.  Also recommend Perfect Pregnancy workout, vol. 1.  It is longer & is really excellent.",1347408000,,776,4.492857142857143
3028632,3,B000YGGNEW,"This video is ok, it was stated that it has work outs for your whole pregnancy; 1 workout per week, and each trimester.  This is not true it only goes up to 6 months.  So after that you are kind of stuck.  The work outs are good, but too intense to be doing the last trimester when your stomach gets in the way.",1299110400,,311,3.9047619047619047
3028633,1,B000YGGNEW,"The trainer in this video helps Gabrielle with everything. While you are at home with no one to help. He also tells you after you get on the ground you might need to stabilize the ball? He holds the chair for Gabrielle and hands her everything, holds the ball stable for her. This is not a do it yourself at home video. Also why not just put a warm up and cool down at the beginning and end of every month? It was a waste of time and money!",1277078400,2,440,3.955056179775281
3028634,4,B000YGGNEW,"First I must say I read a lot of reviews addressing how great Gabby is, how they didn't like her trainer, or the background, or the quality, or buying the ball, weights and band. On the equipment, Ball $2 at Tjmax, the band and light weights $4.50 at Play It Again Sports. This is a 150 minutes of video for $9.99, still a great deal with the added $6.50 in equipment. The rest who cares, it's just cosmetic. On the actual video, the warm ups and cool downs are great, I use them to augment some of my other videos that don't have good warm ups or cool downs. The workouts are quick and fast pace, which is why I bought them, for days when I don't have a lot of time. If one of the workouts isn't enough for you just repeat it as a circuit, or pause the video and do extra reps of each exercise. I do not recommend ever doing a workout that isn't for your trimester and month of pregnancy. I really liked that the workouts are completely different for each month of your trimester for the first two trimesters, you can really get board of the same workout. The exercises are good, safe, and challenging, most of them are different from all the other videos I have reviewed. I am also very happy to finally have abdominal work explained for the second trimester, such as splinting your abs. However I have to add for the same price you can get her Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy Workout video which has third trimester workouts and postnatal workouts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gabrielle-Reece-The-Complete-Fit-and-Healthy-Pregnancy/dp/B001AYWY72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gabrielle Reece: The Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy</a>",1267920000,3,1684,4.975177304964539
3028635,2,B000YGGNEW,"""Fit & Healthy Prenatal Workout"" contains six workouts (1-6 months of pregnancy).  Gabby's other pregnancy DVD, ""The Complete Fit & Healthy Pregnancy,"" contains these identical 6 workouts, plus 6 more (of which 3 are postnatal to help get your body back in shape), for only $2.00 more.  Do not spend your money on this one when you can get the 12-workout one instead.  Nothing in the packaging or description alerted me that I was duplicate buying, so I wasted the money on this one.  Also, make sure you read the ""tips"" section, which is poorly placed at the end rather than the beginning, because it provides very important information about safe-techniques to do everything from the exercises themselves to getting up and down from floor exercises.  Finally, I did find it irritating that several of the exercises require a second person to help you. Although her trainer says you can ""hold onto a door"" or ""secure your band to something,"" I don't have a door that I can pull against the way she was pulling against him, or anything I can attach a band to and pull my entire body weight against without moving it (she used her trainer for these).  Overall, even if these workouts were effective for her, with the assistance of her trainer, they were not well thought out for how efficient and effective they would be for a single woman at home trying to do all of this alone.  That being said, the actual exercises are appropriate, challenging, and physically effective, if you can make them work with all the extras that you need.",1263945600,6,1534,4.701492537313433
3028636,4,B000YGGNEW,Its not your typical bubbly techno blaring workout video (which is nice. lol) It does has a nice break down of exercises. Good variety of workouts. No workouts for third trimester which is a majoy bummer.,1260403200,,204,4.694444444444445
3028637,2,B000YGGNEW,"Though this DVD offers great tips on technique I broke more of a sweat going upstairs to the bonus-room to work out. I was a little disappointed. Gabrielle is such a supreme athlete I was hoping that she would put out a DVD that was somewhat match her level of fitness.
I would recommend this for any novice pregnant woman just getting into working out as opposed to someone who is at an intermediate or an advanced level.",1246233600,,422,4.423076923076923
3028638,5,B000YGGNEW,"This Pre-Natal Workout Dvd with Gabrielle Reece was well worth the money! Includes workouts, warmups & cooldowns for each trimester of pregnancy. Each workout is actually broken down Month 1, Month 2, etc. The workouts are a little challenging, but not too hard. They are 15 min. long, so easy to fit in a busy schedule. It's just enough to help you feel like you're getting a good workout while pregnant. Highly Recommend this DVD!!!!",1243468800,,435,4.8133333333333335
3028639,4,B000YGGNEW,"I bought three prenatal fitness videos when I found out I was pregnant with my third and I am happy with this workout.

I have worked out steadily leading up to this pregnancy and wanted to maintain something and know it was safe.  This video fits the bill.

Yes, you need a fitness ball, resistance bands and some light weights, so be prepared for that.  The workouts are short, so I usually like to do two.  I don't love how chopped up the segments are. You have to go back to the main menu to select warm up then back to the main menu to get to the main workout and then back to the menu again for the cool down, but I do like the exercises and feel like a get enough of a workout without overtaxing myself.

I would agree with another reviewer that the DVD is broken up into trimesters so the first three workouts are designed for the first trimester.  If you're picking this up in your late second and into your third trimester you may not find a whole lot that is relevant for you.

Overall a solid video that I am happy with and will get good mileage out of.",1242000000,,1065,4.135922330097087
3028640,4,B000YGGNEW,The video has shot workouts which I like. The videos are informative and give a good workout.,1235952000,,93,4.529411764705882
3028641,2,B000YGGNEW,"Sorry to say both Gabi and her trainer need a little more personality. It's not only a slow workout, but they are boring. I've tried 3 of the 6 workouts and haven't been impressed.",1232409600,,180,4.323529411764706
3028642,3,B000YGGNEW,"I was disappointed with this video. The workouts are too short and it doesn't seem like the trainer does enough reps. I've got all the equipment needed, but the pace at which we're expected to switch gears is annoying. Gabrielle Reese has her trainer handing her the weights, band and ball but those of us doing it at home aren't so lucky. I feel like I spend half the workout keeping track of my equipment. That said, I do think it has stregthened my back and abs and Reese is pleasant enough on camera. I wouldn't buy it again though.",1225152000,,536,4.37
3028643,5,B000YGGNEW,"Before my pregnancy, I was already doing core exercises, therefore had all the equipment needed.  So it was an easy transition, since I was already doing similar exercises.  I like how the workouts are only 15 minutes and move from one exercise to the next.  I've also found that during the day I can easily do some of the stretches learned.
I feel great afterwards and get a great stretch.  Since my husband is a physical therapist, he is always telling me how good posture prevents back pain.  These exercises definitely help you focus on your posture and strengthen the muscles that support your back.",1223596800,,604,4.714285714285714
3028644,4,B000YGGNEW,"great workout for the preggers out there just one thing I wish they would mention what kinds of exercise equipment that you need before you start, such as stability ball, weights, bands and chair.",1221782400,,196,4.794117647058823
3028645,3,B000YGGNEW,"I have been lifting weights for about 6 months.  Then the first trimester sickness and tiredness took over and I took about a 6 week break from weight lifting.  Today was the first day I tried it and I used this video.  There are positive points and negative points.  The positive is that it's nice that every month (up to 6 months) you get a new workout.  This keeps it interesting.  I also liked that the trainer used different equipment, but then I own all the equipment he used and had it readily available.  I thought that every exercise he did was new and different.  I don't think there was really a single exercise he did that I've done before and I've been working out very regularly for several years.  For the negative, it is not much of a workout.  He says that while pregnant you want to lower the amount of weight and increase the reps, but in the video he does not increase the reps at all.  Most exercises probably average 8 reps, maybe even 6.  I think I'd have to do the video 2x to get a decent workout.  On the plus side, it is very short, so those days you feel like you only have 15 minutes or don't have a lot of energy there is no excuse for not workingout.  Another negative is that the video stops at 6 months, so you're left with no workouts for the next 3 months of your pregnancy (even though in the special features she says she wanted to do a video that covered all 9 months of pregnancy and post partum.  Obviously not this particular video.)

Bottom line, if you have all the equipment ready to go and don't have a ton of high hopes in terms of getting a great heart pounding workout in, this is probably a good video to have for your pregnancy.",1219104000,,1678,4.229559748427673
3028646,1,B000YGGNEW,"I have to agree with other reviewers on wishing I had a heads up to the amount of equipment I needed..and with such a SHORT workout, I found that it was very excessive to have so many different tools needed.  I had been working out prior to my pregnancy so I found this to be a very easy workout as well.  Just felt disappointed and not impressed at all.",1218240000,,354,4.115942028985507
3028647,3,B000YGGNEW,"What I like: 1. she looks great, which is inspiring, and she is a real person when doing these exercises (not flawlessly rehearsed). 2. The 15 minute sessions are perfect for my work schedule.  I do them in the morning before hitting the shower for work. I never get to do the cool down for lack of time. Hard to talk yourself out of a 15 minute workout.  3. The exercises are very effective...and just challenging enough to bring your heart rate up and work your muscles. 4. The exercises feel safe and well planned.

What I don't like:
1. I used to like Gabby Reese, and maybe it's b/c I'm pregnant but she sort of got on my nerves in this video. She and her trainer do not have good chemistry, and you get tired of hearing the commentary between the 2 of them.  I have to remember that she's an athlete and not a TV personality.
2.  You need a partner for a few exercises/stretches.  He suggests replacing a partner with a door knob or bed post at times...neither of which I have. My doors are modern with a lever rather than a knob, which doesn't give me a secure piece to hold onto. In one exercise, he suggests jamming a stretch band in the door for chest pulls. The band snapped loose from the door jam and whipped me PAINFULLY in the face. I was furious!!
3. He transitions from one exercise to the next too quickly sometimes, forgetting that while he is there to assist Gabby with changing out her gear, most ladies at home will not have a personal trainer to fetch these things for her.  By the time you have your chair, ball, etc... they are nearly finished with the set! I.e. they are not mindful of the real audience they have.
4. The video should start with a quick address on what to expect: gear, partner, what to keep nearby throughout the program, what substitutions are acceptable, etc... I found myself scrambling around for things in the middle of the workout.

You need: large bath towel (to make a situp splint), weights, stretch band, partner (or secure door knob or 4-poster bed post!...assuming you are working out in the bedroom!!), stretch ball, and a grippy yoga mat to keep your ball from sliding all over the floor (even on rugs/carpet).",1217808000,2,2168,4.4433249370277075
3028648,4,B000YGGNEW,"What I appreciate so much about this series is the straight forward approach that doesn't rely on bells and whistles to make it interesting. It's about providing a comprehensive workout that targets the right body parts and aims to teach and guide the viewer. I felt challenged and not condescended to, as I have with other workout videos. And I like the idea that Gabby is going through pregnancy with the viewer.",1214697600,,414,4.763888888888889
3028649,4,B000YGGNEW,"NOTE: you will need certain equipment to do these exercises, and it only goes up to ""month 6.""

I've always liked Gabrielle Reece, she seems nice and very down-to-Earth, and she looks great here. She's obviously in very good shape to begin with, (although surprisingly not very flexible!) since she's a pro athlete, and I don't mind her in this DVD at all.

Although, the trainer she uses REALLY annoys me in several ways, particularly the way he constantly says certain words like ""straight, strengthen, strain, strong"" etc- which he pronounces, ""shhtraight, shhtrengthen, shhtrain, shhtrong,"" etc. Oh my GOD it is so annoying since he says words like this non-stop. I'm not sure if I can handle the same workout and hearing him with his annoying speech habits for a month at a time. {Once they get to the second trimester months, I noticed Gabby has picked up this annoying habit from him, and she starts saying things like this!!} It really bothers me, I'm sure some people won't notice, but a lot of people do this now, I guess it's new lazy American ""English."" I find it distracting and irritating. Even when my mom was visiting she heard them talking from the other room and was getting annoyed by them!

The trainer is always interrupting Gabby and they don't communicate well on camera, it seems uncomfortable and awkward. But I don't think that is her fault. It doesn't seem like they rehearsed much which can come off as amateurish and clumsy.
It gets very repetitive after doing them a few times a week since they're such short workouts.

Also, they jump around from one thing to the next (the weights, the ball, the band, a chair, a towel,) and unless you have someone there to keep taking them away and handing them to you, like she does, it's kind of annoying and it doesn't flow- you're always getting up to get something when you just had it in the move before last. They could have maybe grouped them together better or something.

Other than these things, its ok- not too hard, not too easy, and there's modifications for some moves to make them more challenging. It's also not too time consuming or exhausting to do the warm up/workout/cool down, it goes pretty fast.

I guess she has a newer one out that has a third trimester workout and one for after delivery, which makes more sense to buy. This one only goes up to ""month 6.""",1213833600,,2349,4.621103117505995
3028650,2,B000YGGNEW,"I saw this featured in Fit Pregnancy and thought this would be a great workout dvd, but I ended up hating it.

First of all, you will need a chair, hand weights, an exercise band, a towel, a yoga ball... quite a bit of props, I think, for a 15 minute workout session!  What was worse was that it was not mentioned ANYWHERE on the dvd packaging or even in the introduction to the workouts that you would be needing any of these.  So on the first day I was ready to workout, I got all geared up, only to realize I didn't own half of the props I needed, so I wasn't able to do the workout, and instead had to wait until I went out and bought the necessary equipment.

Once I got the equipment, I realized, this workout is ridiculous!  I think I burn more calories jumping up to get my ball, then my strap, then my weights, then my chair, then my ball and my chair... than actually doing the exercises.  What makes it worse is that Gabrielle has her personal trainer with her who hands her each of the props, so she is able to start the next set of exercises right away.  Since I don't have a personal trainer on hand, I have to get up and get the props by myself.  By the time I get situated, Gabrielle is already well into her exercises.

And on the subject of the trainer:  he is really really annoying.  Everytime Gabrielle tries to get a word in, even if it's just a sarcastic joke, he talks right over her.  He interrupts her constantly, and this is really annoying to me.

I also didn't get the impression that Gabrielle and her trainer ever rehearsed this workout before filming.  As the trainer is trying to explain to Gabrielle how to prepare for an exercise, she's completely confused and seems to have no idea what he is talking about.

I thought I'd like this workout, but I was very disappointed.  I even gave it about three tries before deciding to sell it back.

I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone.

3028652,2,B000YGGNEW,"First, my DVD was scratched and it was difficult to get it to work.  When I finally did, all the workouts require additional pieces of equipment.  There is nothing that indicates that those items are required before you play the DVD.  It was a complete turn off for me.  If equipment is needed for the exercises, it would be nice to know so that I could plan accordingly.",1210377600,,371,4.411764705882353
3028653,5,B000YGGNEW,"I'm in my first trimester and I just started this workout.  I don't have a lot of time but still wanted to dedicate 20 -30 minutes of the day for ""me time"".  Some days I'll do the whole rutine (from warming up to exercising and cooling down) and some days I'll skip the warming up part if I'm tight on time.
The workouts are great and they feel safe.  Gabrielle and the trainer keep reminding you to take it easy, listen to your body, do what feels comfortable and they give different options for the times you feel better doing a little less or the times you feel confident that you can challenge yourself and do something a little more difficult.
Believe it or not, the days I don't exercise with this DVD I feel tight by the end of the day, my back really hurts and I don't sleep as well at night!  The days I do excersice I feel SOOOO much better, the difference is amazing!
You do need a couple of things I didn't have like the exercise ball, weighs and the elastic band.  I decided to get the ball and the weighs first and get the elastic band later if I ended up sticking to the exercise. They are not super expensive items and they really help you opening up your chest, stretching your back and so on.

The workouts require some equipment, which isn't mentioned on the box (yoga ball, resistance band and light weights).  I got it in my 6th month so I'm not sure what the earlier months require.

Overall, it's a pretty quick workout that offers a little challenge and covers the body areas that my daily walking routine misses.",1208476800,,574,4.653465346534653
3028655,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is the best prenatal workout I have tried.  With my first pregnancy I tried yoga, Pilates, and Salsa.  All were either boring or not challenging I wish Gabrielle came out with this earlier.

The workouts are short 15-20 minutes so I am able to do them either first thing in the morning before work or during my daughters nap time on the weekends.  I have noticed a big change in my energy and confidence levels.  It really helps with pelvic and back pain.  I haven't gained even half of what I did with my first and I'm sure this will help ease delivery and recovery.

Each workout is accustomed for each trimester and month.  Gabrielle is growing with you which is definitely motivating.  I bought this DVD at the begining of my second trimester and I am now well into my third.  Even though it stops at month 6 you learn so many exercises that are great all throughout your pregnancy.  I am now 35 weeks and no longer use the DVD but still use the exercises with my own routine.  Some days I am only able to do the warm up and cool down.  You just have to pay attention to what your body is telling you or accustom the workouts to how you feel.

-You need too many tools - hand weights, a strechy band, a chair, and a yoga ball. This isn't mentioned on the Amazon description.  You don't find this out until you go to do the workout.

-A partner is used in the video - not practical.  They say you can use a door frame or bedpost but I don't have those near my dvd player.

-It is only for the first 2 trimesters.  No workouts given for the 3rd trimester.

-Not enough leg workout.

-Time is deceptive.  If you do the warm-up, workout, and cool down it takes you more than 15 minutes.

What I liked:

-Good upper body workout (if you have all the tools).",1205625600,,648,4.186991869918699
3263121,2,B000YGGNEW,"I found this workout to be misleading... I was under the impression it covered the entire 9 months, which is probably my fault for reading into things. It only goes through month 6. If you worked out regularly before you were pregnant, you really can use normal workout videos up until month 6. Obviously, you can't do everything and need to use common sense, but there are plenty of excellent toning videos that pregnant women can do up until and probably even through 6 months. (For example, the toning workout (workout 2) from Shape's Bikini Body Transforming Workout was great for me until about 28-29 weeks - I modified the ab exercises at the end of the workout.) That being said, a pregnancy video that only goes up to 6 months is not helpful for people who are already fit and regularly work out. However, if you are new to working out, this may be a good workout for you and may be a good introduction to all the equipment. She also does exercises that require the aid of her trainer - not at all helpful unless you have a workout partner.",1204588800,,1048,4.463541666666667
3263122,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is by far the BEST prenatal workout video available. This is my second pregnancy and I wish this were available during my first. I spent lots of money on other videos that were not challenging enough. This video focuses on toning the areas that can get flabby during pregnancy: arms, glutes, thighs and abs with weight and strength training. These areas needn't be out-of-shape due to pregnancy. Because of this video I have been able to maintain (and build) my muscle tone and prevent the flabbiness, most noticeably in my arms during this pregnancy. The workouts are short (20 minutes) so I can fit them in while my son is taking a nap.
 I found this video six months into my second pregnancy and even though the workouts are labeled for the first and second trimesters I am still completely comfortable with the exercises. I am currently rotating the 4th, 5th and 6th month workouts.
I am thrilled that there is finally a workout challenging enough for people at a medium to high fitness level. You do need a fitness ball, fitness band, and dumb bells to experience the full effects of this workout video but the investment is worth it. My arms look great and I am confident wearing sleeveless shirts during the hot Florida weather because of Gabriel Reece's workouts. Arm jiggling is sure to be banished for users of this video.
Being in shape for my first pregnancy really made my labor and delivery fast and smooth, not to mention my recovery. I am sure the time spent during these workout sessions will only enhance my second time and provide an even faster return to pre-pregnancy form.

I was looking for something that would be fun, work all the ""zones"", and be challenging enough to give me a good, but safe workout. Not to mention a workout that wouldn't take hours to do. This turned out to be exactly the workout I wanted.

I love that there is both a warm-up and cool-down for both the first and second trimester workouts. Also, I like that they have a ~15-minute workout per month, so you can do just that or more, depending on how you feel.

I personally like the casual nature of the DVD -- like the trainer telling Gabby to keep that belly button in and she responds that it is in. :) I also really like the changes throughout the workouts from using a ball to bands to weights or combinations. That keeps me more mentally engaged.

Now in my second trimester, I do in fact feel like the title of the DVD -- fit and healthy. I would recommend this to anyone who is already active and wants to stay strong as their baby belly continues to grow.",1204156800,10,1056,4.192118226600985

Because working out can be a little uncomfortable while pregnant (not being sure what is safe to do) it was really comforting to me to know that this was all safe. Being able to see Gabrielle go through the workouts as she too was growing was very cool. It was so much better to see another pregnant woman doing the workout instead of someone who was not pregnant. The trainer was very patient and soothing to watch. He was encouraging without the uncomfortable ""go go go"" cheering you typically get from workout videos. One of the best parts for me was that there wasn't the typical annoying workout music. This whole workout was not the typical workout DVD. It was a little more raw and real. I liked that. I say give it a shot. I look forward to the 3rd trimester video release.

The first workout is for women in the first month of pregnancy, the second for the second month, and on through month six.  So if you're already in your sixth month, like I am, this video isn't very useful.

A lot of equipment is required: light weights, bands, and a workout ball. Since I only have weights, I had to improvise for the exercises with the bands and workout ball.

Gabrielle awkwardly follows the directions of her trainer. It doesn't seem like the two planned the workouts very well. Gabrielle appears to not to know what's coming next.

While Gabrielle looks gorgeous, she doesn't smile and she seems nervous and uncomfortable in front of the camera.

The workouts are very short, and I didn't feel like I accomplished much in the 20 minutes. It was awkward to follow, not very fun, challenging, or satisfying.  I guess if you're looking for a quick workout, it'll do. But I'm pretty disappointed.",1203552000,38,1000,4.818713450292398

At first it was frustrating that Gabby's trainer assisted her so much & used so much equipment but with a little creativity most of the exercises can be adapted using dumbbells instead of a theraband.  Some guidance from the trainer on how to make these adaptations would be great if they decide to come out with an updated edition.  Overall the workouts are wonderfully well rounded & I think have gotten better in the 2nd trimester.  I can't speak much to the 3rd trimester yet.  It is also great that there is a new workout for each month, keeping the workout fresh.  Very glad to have found this pre-natal work out dvd.  Also recommend Perfect Pregnancy workout, vol. 1.

On the equipment, Ball $2 at Tjmax, the band and light weights $4.50 at Play It Again Sports. This is a 150 minutes of video for $9.99, still a great deal with the added $6.50 in equipment. The rest who cares, it's just cosmetic. On the actual video, the warm ups and cool downs are great, I use them to augment some of my other videos that don't have good warm ups or cool downs. The workouts are quick and fast pace, which is why I bought them, for days when I don't have a lot of time. If one of the workouts isn't enough for you just repeat it as a circuit, or pause the video and do extra reps of each exercise. I do not recommend ever doing a workout that isn't for your trimester and month of pregnancy. I really liked that the workouts are completely different for each month of your trimester for the first two trimesters, you can really get board of the same workout. The exercises are good, safe, and challenging, most of them are different from all the other videos I have reviewed.

Do not spend your money on this one when you can get the 12-workout one instead.  Nothing in the packaging or description alerted me that I was duplicate buying, so I wasted the money on this one.  Also, make sure you read the ""tips"" section, which is poorly placed at the end rather than the beginning, because it provides very important information about safe-techniques to do everything from the exercises themselves to getting up and down from floor exercises.  Finally, I did find it irritating that several of the exercises require a second person to help you. Although her trainer says you can ""hold onto a door"" or ""secure your band to something,"" I don't have a door that I can pull against the way she was pulling against him, or anything I can attach a band to and pull my entire body weight against without moving it (she used her trainer for these).  Overall, even if these workouts were effective for her, with the assistance of her trainer, they were not well thought out for how efficient and effective they would be for a single woman at home trying to do all of this alone.

I have worked out steadily leading up to this pregnancy and wanted to maintain something and know it was safe.  This video fits the bill.

Yes, you need a fitness ball, resistance bands and some light weights, so be prepared for that.  The workouts are short, so I usually like to do two.  I don't love how chopped up the segments are. You have to go back to the main menu to select warm up then back to the main menu to get to the main workout and then back to the menu again for the cool down, but I do like the exercises and feel like a get enough of a workout without overtaxing myself.

I would agree with another reviewer that the DVD is broken up into trimesters so the first three workouts are designed for the first trimester.  If you're picking this up in your late second and into your third trimester you may not find a whole lot that is relevant for you.

3263142,3,B000YGGNEW,"I have been lifting weights for about 6 months.  Then the first trimester sickness and tiredness took over and I took about a 6 week break from weight lifting.  Today was the first day I tried it and I used this video.  There are positive points and negative points.  The positive is that it's nice that every month (up to 6 months) you get a new workout.  This keeps it interesting.  I also liked that the trainer used different equipment, but then I own all the equipment he used and had it readily available.  I thought that every exercise he did was new and different.  I don't think there was really a single exercise he did that I've done before and I've been working out very regularly for several years.  For the negative, it is not much of a workout.  He says that while pregnant you want to lower the amount of weight and increase the reps, but in the video he does not increase the reps at all.  Most exercises probably average 8 reps, maybe even 6.  I think I'd have to do the video 2x to get a decent workout.  On the plus side, it is very short, so those days you feel like you only have 15 minutes or don't have a lot of energy there is no excuse for not workingout.  Another negative is that the video stops at 6 months, so you're left with no workouts for the next 3 months of your pregnancy (even though in the special features she says she wanted to do a video that covered all 9 months of pregnancy and post partum.  Obviously not this particular video.)

3263144,3,B000YGGNEW,"What I like: 1. she looks great, which is inspiring, and she is a real person when doing these exercises (not flawlessly rehearsed). 2. The 15 minute sessions are perfect for my work schedule.  I do them in the morning before hitting the shower for work. I never get to do the cool down for lack of time. Hard to talk yourself out of a 15 minute workout.  3. The exercises are very effective...and just challenging enough to bring your heart rate up and work your muscles. 4. The exercises feel safe and well planned.

What I don't like:
1. I used to like Gabby Reese, and maybe it's b/c I'm pregnant but she sort of got on my nerves in this video. She and her trainer do not have good chemistry, and you get tired of hearing the commentary between the 2 of them.  I have to remember that she's an athlete and not a TV personality.
2.  You need a partner for a few exercises/stretches.  He suggests replacing a partner with a door knob or bed post at times...neither of which I have. My doors are modern with a lever rather than a knob, which doesn't give me a secure piece to hold onto. In one exercise, he suggests jamming a stretch band in the door for chest pulls. The band snapped loose from the door jam and whipped me PAINFULLY in the face. I was furious!!
3. He transitions from one exercise to the next too quickly sometimes, forgetting that while he is there to assist Gabby with changing out her gear, most ladies at home will not have a personal trainer to fetch these things for her.  By the time you have your chair, ball, etc... they are nearly finished with the set! I.e. they are not mindful of the real audience they have.
4. The video should start with a quick address on what to expect: gear, partner, what to keep nearby throughout the program, what substitutions are acceptable, etc... I found myself scrambling around for things in the middle of the workout.

You need: large bath towel (to make a situp splint), weights, stretch band, partner (or secure door knob or 4-poster bed post!...assuming you are working out in the bedroom!!), stretch ball, and a grippy yoga mat to keep your ball from sliding all over the floor (even on rugs/carpet).",1217808000,2,2168,4.4433249370277075

3263146,4,B000YGGNEW,"NOTE: you will need certain equipment to do these exercises, and it only goes up to ""month 6.""

I've always liked Gabrielle Reece, she seems nice and very down-to-Earth, and she looks great here. She's obviously in very good shape to begin with, (although surprisingly not very flexible!) since she's a pro athlete, and I don't mind her in this DVD at all.

Although, the trainer she uses REALLY annoys me in several ways, particularly the way he constantly says certain words like ""straight, strengthen, strain, strong"" etc- which he pronounces, ""shhtraight, shhtrengthen, shhtrain, shhtrong,"" etc. Oh my GOD it is so annoying since he says words like this non-stop. I'm not sure if I can handle the same workout and hearing him with his annoying speech habits for a month at a time. {Once they get to the second trimester months, I noticed Gabby has picked up this annoying habit from him, and she starts saying things like this!!} It really bothers me, I'm sure some people won't notice, but a lot of people do this now, I guess it's new lazy American ""English."" I find it distracting and irritating. Even when my mom was visiting she heard them talking from the other room and was getting annoyed by them!

The trainer is always interrupting Gabby and they don't communicate well on camera, it seems uncomfortable and awkward. But I don't think that is her fault. It doesn't seem like they rehearsed much which can come off as amateurish and clumsy.
It gets very repetitive after doing them a few times a week since they're such short workouts.

Also, they jump around from one thing to the next (the weights, the ball, the band, a chair, a towel,) and unless you have someone there to keep taking them away and handing them to you, like she does, it's kind of annoying and it doesn't flow- you're always getting up to get something when you just had it in the move before last. They could have maybe grouped them together better or something.

Other than these things, its ok- not too hard, not too easy, and there's modifications for some moves to make them more challenging. It's also not too time consuming or exhausting to do the warm up/workout/cool down, it goes pretty fast.

I guess she has a newer one out that has a third trimester workout and one for after delivery, which makes more sense to buy. This one only goes up to ""month 6.""",1213833600,,2349,4.621103117505995

First of all, you will need a chair, hand weights, an exercise band, a towel, a yoga ball... quite a bit of props, I think, for a 15 minute workout session!  What was worse was that it was not mentioned ANYWHERE on the dvd packaging or even in the introduction to the workouts that you would be needing any of these.  So on the first day I was ready to workout, I got all geared up, only to realize I didn't own half of the props I needed, so I wasn't able to do the workout, and instead had to wait until I went out and bought the necessary equipment.

Once I got the equipment, I realized, this workout is ridiculous!  I think I burn more calories jumping up to get my ball, then my strap, then my weights, then my chair, then my ball and my chair... than actually doing the exercises.  What makes it worse is that Gabrielle has her personal trainer with her who hands her each of the props, so she is able to start the next set of exercises right away.  Since I don't have a personal trainer on hand, I have to get up and get the props by myself.  By the time I get situated, Gabrielle is already well into her exercises.

And on the subject of the trainer:  he is really really annoying.  Everytime Gabrielle tries to get a word in, even if it's just a sarcastic joke, he talks right over her.  He interrupts her constantly, and this is really annoying to me.

I also didn't get the impression that Gabrielle and her trainer ever rehearsed this workout before filming.  As the trainer is trying to explain to Gabrielle how to prepare for an exercise, she's completely confused and seems to have no idea what he is talking about.

I thought I'd like this workout, but I was very disappointed.  I even gave it about three tries before deciding to sell it back.

I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone.

3263149,2,B000YGGNEW,"First, my DVD was scratched and it was difficult to get it to work.  When I finally did, all the workouts require additional pieces of equipment.  There is nothing that indicates that those items are required before you play the DVD.  It was a complete turn off for me.  If equipment is needed for the exercises, it would be nice to know so that I could plan accordingly.",1210377600,,371,4.411764705882353
3263150,5,B000YGGNEW,"I'm in my first trimester and I just started this workout.  I don't have a lot of time but still wanted to dedicate 20 -30 minutes of the day for ""me time"".  Some days I'll do the whole rutine (from warming up to exercising and cooling down) and some days I'll skip the warming up part if I'm tight on time.
The workouts are great and they feel safe.  Gabrielle and the trainer keep reminding you to take it easy, listen to your body, do what feels comfortable and they give different options for the times you feel better doing a little less or the times you feel confident that you can challenge yourself and do something a little more difficult.
Believe it or not, the days I don't exercise with this DVD I feel tight by the end of the day, my back really hurts and I don't sleep as well at night!  The days I do excersice I feel SOOOO much better, the difference is amazing!
You do need a couple of things I didn't have like the exercise ball, weighs and the elastic band.  I decided to get the ball and the weighs first and get the elastic band later if I ended up sticking to the exercise. They are not super expensive items and they really help you opening up your chest, stretching your back and so on.
I highly recomend it!",1209427200,,1232,4.203389830508475
3263151,4,B000YGGNEW,"I agree with some of the comments from another reviewer that Gabrielle and the trainer seem a little out of synch, but I think that's OK.  It's tough sometimes to follow videos right from the start so seeing that Gabby is learning too was helpful.

The workouts require some equipment, which isn't mentioned on the box (yoga ball, resistance band and light weights).  I got it in my 6th month so I'm not sure what the earlier months require.

Overall, it's a pretty quick workout that offers a little challenge and covers the body areas that my daily walking routine misses.",1208476800,,574,4.653465346534653
3263152,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is the best prenatal workout I have tried.  With my first pregnancy I tried yoga, Pilates, and Salsa.  All were either boring or not challenging I wish Gabrielle came out with this earlier.

The workouts are short 15-20 minutes so I am able to do them either first thing in the morning before work or during my daughters nap time on the weekends.  I have noticed a big change in my energy and confidence levels.  It really helps with pelvic and back pain.  I haven't gained even half of what I did with my first and I'm sure this will help ease delivery and recovery.

Each workout is accustomed for each trimester and month.  Gabrielle is growing with you which is definitely motivating.  I bought this DVD at the begining of my second trimester and I am now well into my third.  Even though it stops at month 6 you learn so many exercises that are great all throughout your pregnancy.  I am now 35 weeks and no longer use the DVD but still use the exercises with my own routine.  Some days I am only able to do the warm up and cool down.  You just have to pay attention to what your body is telling you or accustom the workouts to how you feel.
I hope she comes out with her postnatal video before my delivery in September.",1208217600,,1230,4.2727272727272725
3263153,5,B000YGGNEW,"This is my first pregnancy and continuing to be active was very important to me. Gabrielle Reece's DVD is excellent! It walks you through a ""REAL"" prenatal workout at each stage of the pregnancy. She even had me laughing at times because she says out load what most of us are thinking while working out and pregnant. The DVD was well done and is great for anyone at any fitness level and stage of pregnancy.",1207526400,,407,4.44

3263155,1,B000YGGNEW,"I bought this when I was almost 6 months pregnant, not realizing that it only gives workouts for the first and second trimester. Mostly my fault because I should've known I can't workout too much towards the end... but I really didn't like that for all the workouts, you need different equipment. You need weights, a stretch band, and an exercise ball. Make sure you have all the equipment before you start. Basically, I have no use for this DVD now.",1207440000,3,450,4.567901234567901

8232664,5,B000YGGNEW,This came recommended to me by a friend when my wife was expecting.  Exercise is good for anyone and can be very important for expectant mothers that are able to exercise.  Make sure you're doctor recommends though.,1387497600,,215,4.783783783783784
8232665,3,B000YGGNEW,"I don't hate it, but it's not the best prenatal workout dvd. It requires a lot of different workout equipment and I prefer workouts with less. The instructor and Gabrielle seem kind of awkward together, and it gets even more weird when the term ""kegels"" come up.",1372636800,,262,4.595744680851064
8232666,5,B000YGGNEW,"I have used 4-5 other pregnancy work out videos, and this is by far the best one out on the market.  During my first pregnancy, I started using this video in my 3rd month of pregnancy and continued to use it until my 8th month.  After I had my first child, I started working out with the postnatal workouts as well since many other workouts were too strenuous right away.  I liked the video so much that I used it again during my second pregnancy.

I read a complaint about being 6 months pregnant and not being able to use much of the video.  Yet the video has workouts for months 1-3 that can be mixed, months 4-6 that can be mixed, or the last trimester.  In addition, I found myself going out of order because I appreciated how the video was designed with comfort, medical input, and exercises that can be modified.  What I don't appreciate about most other videos on the market is that it is the SAME routine for all stages of pregnancy; they become boring and monotonous.

This video is really the best on the market for its versatility.  If I have a third baby, I just hope Gabrielle Reece updates the video with another version; otherwise, I'll be happy enough to reuse my own original copy because it's the only video I've found so far that doesn't bore me after the 5th time using it.",1364342400,,1294,4.358333333333333
8232667,3,B000YGGNEW,"I thought this DVD was ok. I didn't make it through a whole workout. I was so excited to get started but I went through about a half hour and felt like we hadn't even accomplished anything. Its not the style where she does the exercises and you follow along at home and get the workout done in an hour... The whole time she had a personal trainer guy going over the moves and showing her how to do them. I guess you can go through it once and memorize the moves to do on your own later but I can't imagine watching and following along every day, seems like a waste of time for every day use. I got a better use of my time using Lindsay Brin's prenatal series.",1361923200,,659,4.038167938931298
8232668,4,B000YGGNEW,"Unfortunately, I didn't keep up doing these workouts for as long as I hoped (chalk that up to carrying twins), but during my first months of pregnancy, I really enjoyed these videos. Gabrielle and the trainer came across really friendly and realistic to the pressures of being pregnant. Prior to pregnancy I had just started to enjoy exercise (loved riding my bike and was fairly consistent with weight-training, too) but hadn't been in the greatest shape. I was immediately told to cease all exercise that brought my heart-rate up. These videos fit my doctor's orders perfectly. I could do them, feel better physically & mentally, and not worry that I was harming our babies.

The workouts are completely do-able in your living room (with just a little bit of space needed) and don't absolutely require any unique workout accessories. There were a few positions I couldn't get into alone (Gabby had help from her trainer for some moves), and a few that I wasn't flexible enough to make the most of -- but overall, the workout was realistic and the trainer seemed quite knowledgeable. Recommended.",1360022400,,1097,4.92972972972973
8232669,2,B000YGGNEW,"I am trying out all the prenatal DVDs I can get my hand on, granted, I didn't start these until 30 weeks because I work all the time and mostly just use the elliptical.  I'm an obstetrician, and honestly you don't need to use workout specific to pregnancy in the first trimester and really in the beginning of the second trimester either.  This is why this video is so ridiculous - it has a new workout for each month you are pregnant up until 6 months (24 weeks), which isn't even into the 3rd trimester yet.  First off, most people don't even find out they are pregnancy until they are at least 4 weeks along (you miss your first cycle at 4 weeks.)  I think they hardest time to find appropriate y, that,exercise is as you get more and more pregnant, so it just seems ridiculous to me that this only goes until 24 weeks.

Not only that, I didn't actually bother to do the workouts because I was 30 weeks along when I got it from Netflix, but I watched part of it anyways and Gabi Reece seemed totally disengaged from the workout and the trainer and it looked pretty boring.

She apparently has a different pregnancy video, and I plan on trying that one too.  Look for my review!",1357084800,,1180,4.3122171945701355
