8087835,5,B000BKDNYY,"Excellent documentary, especially when watched after reading Neal Bascomb's book, Sabotage. The documentary chronicle's some of the history behind the search for heavy water, the Allies desire to keep it out of German hands, and the underwater search for the sunken barrels. Includes an interview with Knut Lier-Hansen, member of the Norwegian resistance and one of the saboteurs.

8087839,5,B000BKDNYY,"Forget Hitchcock's Notorious, this WW2 tale of espionage to forestall the Nazis from developing the first atomic bomb is for real, and every bit as suspenseful. After providing background information on the process of manufacturing the hydrogen isotope deuterium (""heavy water""), present-day interviews are conducted with civilian survivors of the sabotaged ferry ""SF Hydro"" force sunken by Norwegian commandos in 1944 because it was carrying barrels suspected of containing this critical material which had been manufactured high above Lake Tinnsjo at the Nazi occupied Vemork Hydroelectric Plant. Did the barrels (now lying in deep water) actually contain ""heavy water"" or were they decoys? Sixty-one years later (2005) we are invited along as researchers strive to find the answer to this question by raising intact one of the barrels to find out... if they can. The DVD is presented in a wide-screen format.",1325548800,10,911,5.422535211267606
