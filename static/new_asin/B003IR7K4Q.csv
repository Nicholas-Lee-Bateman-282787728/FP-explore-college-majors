I have a strong theory this concept will come to replace or in the least side along w/ the funny book art form. I love all things Batman & I love anthologies so this is the perfect combination. Just seeing all the stunning art from a vast array of artists to the tight narration, each tale is singular in its presentation of Gotham City & its inhabitants. If you like comics you can't go wrong w/ this. The idea of using subtle animating techniques onto original comic book illustrations is truly innovative. Personally I look forward to future releases in this format from DC, Marvel, & any other comic publisher's willing to test out the waters. This is the future of entertainment.",1317340800,,775,4.58273381294964
4127966,5,B003IR7K4Q,"Just a few years ago, I read the BATMAN BLACK & WHITE comic books and enjoyed not just the writing but the variety of art and the black and grey color schemes. Real classic Film Noir material. And with this DVD, those works take on a whole new dimension with motion, music, voice, and sound effects. Every Batman fan from age 4 to 104 can enjoy this DVD whether they enjoy just the action or the more sophisticated stories. This DVD and others like it are a terrific addition to any BatCollectors inventory.",1294099200,2,507,4.462365591397849
4127967,4,B003IR7K4Q,"I'm not sure what to write here. I really enjoy most of the batman presentations. To have a graphic novel set to video was very exciting to me. The challenge here is that it is not one consistent series, but a series of short vignettes. Each of them are all so different. Some of them are really good. Others are not nearly as good. If you are a Batman fan and can't get enough of the character then you simply must have this. Although I wasn't blown out of my socks, the curiosity of having not seen it would have kept me wanting to take a look.

My real challenge is that my first exposure to the motion comics genre was ""Ironman:extremis"". That was absolutely incredible from the story, voice-overs and artwork. As a result I can't help, but compare the two. If I had to persist in the comparison, Batman loses.... Big Time!

However, I will say that this program does give greater insight into the Batman character's inner thoughts. For that I give it high praise. I have no regrets for my purchase. I enjoyed it and will have my brother watch it as well. Ultimately you will have to judge for yourself. I hope this review helps.

4127968,2,B003IR7K4Q,"Watched this motion comic & found it very enjoyable. But motion comics are getting better. Do a search & you know what I mean. Now the audio was great. Voice actors top of their game. Motion comics are like watching the Marvels 1960s cartoons which did similar stuff, except that these motion comics didn't move their lips. Now for the down part. On my dvd only one episode was not watchable as it not their. Collection One, chapter 10. ""Perpetual mourning"". I would have given 4 stars but Warner Brothers should do better check-ups for mishaps like this. The reviewer above nails it too for his review.",1279152000,,603,4.644859813084112
4127969,4,B003IR7K4Q,"If you're like me (god help you if are--never gets old, people!), you probably looked at the description and asked, ""What the @#$% is a 'motion comic'?"" Remember the 1960s Marvel comics cartoons, which were images lifted off the comics page and given some semblance of motion? It's like that, though this effort is a tad more sophisticated and lot closer to the source material.

Surprisingly, I wasn't bothered by the stilted animation as I was in the early Marvel ones. (Again, that's probably because it's closer to the source material; you don't get images that are mushed together from completely different stories.) Once you begin to enjoy the format, you can focus on the stories.

This particular ""motion comic"" is a great one: The first 2 volumes of ""Batman: Black and White"" were surprisingly stong. Generally, multi-team efforts produce a wide range of quality, but these are mostly above-par stories.

Couple of downsides, mostly in the format: You have to sit through the introduction and closing credits after EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. And yeah, you can hit the ""advance"" or ""fast forward"" button; but because these segments are so short, you're doing it every couple of minutes, and it gets ridiculous after the 12th time or so. (This problem is even worse with another DC motion comic, ""MAD LOVE / BATGIRL: YEAR ONE."") Also, this is a bit pricier for a DVD, roughly $5 more for a DVD that isn't even full length (it comes in under the obligatory 75 minutes, esp. if you exclude the multiple multiple MULTIPLE credits). Plus, it will play only on DVD-R capable machines, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, I can heartily recommend it to Batman and DC Comics fans.",1271376000,9,1672,4.839160839160839
