3423570,5,B00195FUCI,I bought this as I love the national parks and the price was very reasonable for 15 hours of footage. The picture is clear and the narration is informative. I would recommend this to anyone.,1259539200,22,190,4.457142857142857
3423571,5,B00195FUCI,Gave this as a gift to older couple who will be seeing Yellowsonte Natl. Park for their first time this summer.  They're were amazed at its beauty & the coverage of the Park that this DVD showed - if you're not into guidebooks this is the next best thing!,1247961600,11,255,4.204081632653061
3423572,5,B00195FUCI,"If you want a recent DVD that really covers this beautiful place like a blanket, this is it. Beautiful overhead shots from helicopters, in all seasons. Closeup pictures of wildlife and wildflowers. Quick interviews with real park visitors and park rangers. Nice shots of the major lodging facilities in the park. A little about the fun stuff to do just outside the park (snomobiling in the winter) as well as inside (swimming in the swimming hole, fishing, horseback riding, sightseeing, wildlife viewing...).

I wanted it to help me plan an upcoming trip. If you can not go to Yellowstone, this video will make you feel as if you have been there. Wow!

There is also a bonus video about Grand Teton National Park, the breathtaking smaller park just South of Yellowstone.",1239494400,34,771,4.877862595419847
3423573,5,B00195FUCI,"This is an excellent National Park DVD set.  I own most (if not all) of the National Park collections already, and this is by far my most favorite.  It has the best video quality and is in widescreen viewing format (it says on the box that it is filmed in high-definition).  I have only a couple complaints about the set: (1) the first is that more time should of been spent on the parks themselves, and not on other topics such as the lodges, inns, maintenance issues, etc, (2) there can be a repetitive element to the collection, in that certain portions of one DVD are also featured on another DVD, and (3) I don't believe there were any parks east of the Rockies featured in this collection, which is ashame.  Beside these minor flaws, I believe this collection is a must-own for National Park buffs like myself.  There are 2 to 4 features per disc, with each feature running approximately 50 minutes. I have listed the contents and a description of each disc below.

DISC 1: (1) Yosemite: America's Treasure, (2) Wild National Parks, (3) National Parks: Extreme Maintenance.

Yosemite - Venture into the heart of Yosemite and marvel at a legendary landscape of soaring granite peaks, tower sequoias and thundering waterfalls that are among the world's tallest. Next, answer the call of Wild National Parks, from bear watching in Alaska to discovering a hidden world of over 1,000 species of bees in Arizona. Then, meet the dedicated workers who preserve the National Parks for future generations in Extreme Maintenance.

DISC 2: (1) Yellowstone: America's First National Park, (2) Inside Grand Teton National Park.

Yellowstone - Yellowstone ignites the imagination! Llama trekking, wolf watching and geyser gazing are just a few of the out-of-the-ordinary activities that await you. Inside Grand Teton National Park, saddle up for a working dude ranch, feel the rush of whitewater rafting and witness a staggering array of wildlife in America's Eden.

DISC 3: (1) Inside Grand Canyon National Park, (2) Zion & Bryce National Parks, (3) National Parks Of The Southwest.

Grand Canyon and The Great Southwest - Experience the supreme spectacle of one of the world's natural wonders, the Grand Canyon. Journey rim-to-rim through extreme backcountry and hidden side canyons, along wild rivers and into ancient pools. In Zion and Bryce National Parks, embark on a breath-stealing two-mile ascent to Angel's Landing, take a day hike through the watery Narrows and test your mettle climbing sheer cliff walls. National Parks of the Great Southwest reveals vast lands of astonishing beauty in Canyonlands, Arches, Saguaro and Death Valley.

DISC 4: (1) Mount Rushmore & The Black Hills, (2) Great Train Rides, (3) Lodges & Inns.

National Park Icons - Mount Rushmore & the Black Hills presents a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the monumental Mount Rushmore. From the elegant American Orient Express to the restored glory of the Grand Canyon Railway, it is all aboard for Great Train Rides through America's National Parks.  Do not forget to make your reservation for Lodges and Inns to kick back in luxurious getaways and rustic retreats, including Yellowstone's Old Faithful Inn and Yosemite's Ahwahnee.

DISC 5: (1) The Best Of The National Parks, (2) Hawaii's National Parks, (3) Denali National Parks, (4) Secrets Of The Southwest.

The Best of the National Parks - Discover a universe of the spectacular and seek out the best place to delve deep into the earth, scale a mountain or tie the knot in The Best of the National Parks. Witness molten lava bubbling from the earth, catch a spectacular sunrise above the clouds or take a dip into pools of paradise in Hawaii's National Parks. Then, get a touch of the tundra in rugged and beautiful Alaska's Denali National Park, where you will experience the untamed wilderness with wildlife roaming free, and take to the air over a river of ice. Secrets of the Southwest uncovers the land made famous by Georgia O'Keeffe and takes you to where many of Hollywood's classic Westerns were filmed.

DISC 6: (1) Glacier National Park, (2) Canadian Rockies: Banff & Jasper, (3) British Columbia: Vancouver & Beyond.

The Rockies and Beyond - In Glacier National Park, reach up to the clouds along America's most scenic mountain pass, raft a river wild and take an unforgettable trek along the Highline Trail. Canadian Rockies: Banff & Jasper's explores a region renowned for its panoramic beauty, ice-fields, glaciers, high mountain passes and Black Diamond downhill runs. British Columbia: Vancouver & Beyond cruises the Pacific Northwest where rugged coastlines and ancient forests give way to world-class cities.",1231286400,105,4679,5.054545454545455
3423574,5,B00195FUCI,"I bought this and another for my father.  He had been watching scenery like this while he was in the hospital and it calmed him.  Sadly it arrived the day after he passed.

3423599,5,B00195FUCI,This is SUCH a great purchase! The DVD package allows me to explore these natural wonders from the comfort of my home.

3423605,5,B00195FUCI,"Truly one of the best documentaries I've ever watched till now.

Filmed in high quality, interesting and has everything I love; nature, details about each place, lodges to stay in, sense of the culture of each area.  Very very happy with this set.

And the extras are very interesting as well; i.e. extreme maintenance of the parks and behind the scenes.",1428278400,,354,4.770491803278689
3423606,4,B00195FUCI,"$9 is a bargain for 6 discs.  A lot information, Most of them are good, some are just okay.

It is in 1:85 or 1:77 aspect ratio not 1:33 as Amazon described. That's a great plus.  Video quality is good in general but not fantastic HD quality as they claim.

A lot marketing talks about the local hotels and restaurants. Most of them are upscale and quite expensive.  Wish it would also tell us other less costly alternatives for budget minded retirees like us.

We have visited most of the national parks featured in the video.  It gives viewers a good highlights of each parks. It will definitely inspire you to visit all these places but it is hardly a complete tourist guide.  Research on line and do some home work before you go on trip.",1426291200,5,741,4.397058823529412

3423619,5,B00195FUCI,"There are MANY available DVDs on Yellowstone, and after narrowing it down I can say that this one is superior. There are no corners cut in making this film. The photography is stellar. And there are TWO films on this disc: an hour of Yellowstone and an hour of the Grand Tetons (with an emphasis on wildlife, rock climbing, and winter sports, including pretty cool stuff about avalanche rescues). I wanted these for the scenery, and it does deliver! the wildlife footage is amazing and they include shots of Yellowstone features that you don't see on the main tourist loop. Just watching it makes me want to go back and see all the things I didn't even know I had missed.",1360800000,3,671,4.553719008264463

3423632,5,B00195FUCI,"I always seem to want to rate things with a half.  I gave this a 5, but to me it's really a 4.5.  I've been to many if not most of the parks, but there's always more I don't know about them and I enjoy watching when I can't be there, which is most of the time.  I disliked as much time as they spent on the Canadian and Alaskan parks, partly because they don't interest me as much, partly because they aren't very accessible and would be difficult for me to visit or explore.  Still, overall very good, both content and production.",1331683200,7,531,4.12621359223301

3423637,5,B00195FUCI,"An excellent introduction to Yellowstone, its major features, and what you can expect to see on a first visit.  The variety of geological features, wildlife, etc., is mind-boggling!  Also some great background on the Park's origins, pioneers, etc.  Before my trip to Italy, I viewed Rick Steves' videos of that country and they were a great help.  I really knew what I'd see, what to expect, what the various places actually looked like.  This Yellowstone video has given me the same experience regarding my trip to that National Park.",1283212800,9,535,4.966292134831461
