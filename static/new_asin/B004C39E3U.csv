4324621,4,B004C39E3U,"A must-have, regarding the recent events which have characterized the life of Andie Latimer, whose title- ""The Opening Farewell""- is emblematic: a collection of famous immortal tracks like the sensible ""Ice"" or the intelligent ""Spirit of Water"" (regardless the fantastic ""Lunar Sea"" from ""Moodmadness"" and ""Mother Road"" from ""Dust and Dreams"") and a few less famous tunes, such as ""Slow Yourself Down"", ""Another Night"" or ""For today""...a famous gig held at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz- California it was- and actually the opener of a successful (as I hoped in it) Tour 2010, in which Camel performed also ""A Fox Hill"", here not present unfortunately...but coming back to the set list, you will remain enthusiast in front of ""Lady Fantasy"" and of course will feel nostalgia for some sensible songs like ""Unevensong"", ""Hymm to her"" or ""Echoes"", just to mention the classics and finally still loving the flute and the guitar excursions too, regarding ""Rhayader""/Rhayader Goes To Town"" (from ""The Snow Goose"" naturally), after all: here Tom Brislin (already present in the ""Yessymphonic Tour) is excellent at the keyboards, but also the other musicians support Andie in a magnificent way!! If this was the ""Farewell Tour"", for me it's very sad!! Camel is among the bands which gave an important contribution to my artistic path...this live is an important document, coupled with the fantastic gig of ""Coming of Age"" and aligned with the artistic contribution of the early eighties at the time of ""Live Pressure"" (dated 1984, if I'm not wrong...), talking about the recording quality and the choice of the songs (even though I don't like ""Stationary Traveller"" very much, but nevermind...). In spite of my considerations above, I forgive them for ""erasing"" a lot of gems from ""Harbour of Tears"" to ""Dust and Dreams"", but actually it's a minor defect, cause the present live is well worth checking out and I hope that all the new fans will buy it!",1319241600,,1940,5.027950310559007
4324622,4,B004C39E3U,"Camel's live performances are always excellent, so is this one. In addition the production is very good.
Highly recommended.",1310947200,,124,5.578947368421052
4324623,5,B004C39E3U,"Denis Clement was the drummer.  I was there too - so naturally had to have this.  My name is even in the liner notes!!  This is an excellent introduction to Camel with a good assortment of songs from old and new albums - all sounding fresh.  You can get one more song from this concert on Footage Two where Colin Bass did a very spirited Fox Hill (""it's not about fox hunting!!"").",1303257600,9,380,4.236111111111111
4324624,5,B004C39E3U,"I became a Camel fan late. I was unable to see them at Nearfest but was excited to learn they were coming to Atlanta, which is much closer. The day of the concert I called the venue to find out what time the doors opened. The person on the line said...""Oh, you didn't hear...the show was cancelled. The drummer is sick"" Was I bummed. But at least now I got to see their final show by purchasing this DVD. I highly recommend this one plus their ""Coming of Age"" DVD.",1297296000,6,464,4.166666666666667
4324625,4,B004C39E3U,"This concert was just to be more of a trial run for the ""last"" US tour ... Andrew Latimer was obviously feeling tired due to his health issues but still gave it his all and treated the fans there (and us via the DVD) to a passionate performance ... again, highly recommended to any true Camel fan ...",1297036800,3,300,4.189655172413793
4324626,5,B004C39E3U,"I had been looking forward to this release for a long time. The reason is because I was there. This was a concert advertised only to fans on the Camel Productions web site. It was at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz CA, USA, a small intimate venue for Andrew Latimer and Camel to test out the material for the first time in front of an audience before the tour.

The show was fantastic and the DVD reflects that. The set list includes: Lady Fantasy, Unevensong, Hymm to her, Echoes, Stationary Traveller, Drafted, Rhaydar, Rhaydar Goes To Town, Lunar Sea, Another Night, Ice, Spirit of Water, Slow Yourself Down, Mother Road, For Today). The only songs from the show that I remember not being included here are Fox Hill (which is on Footage II) and Homage to the God of Light. If you were to add that material in here you might have to sacrafice picture quality to get the whole show to fit on the DVD so I'm not complaining.

Among the players is Tom Brislin (Keyboards) who Yes fans might recognize from the Yes Symphonic Tour when Rick Wakemen was not touring with YES. Colin Bass is on Bass and forgive me for not having the drummers name in my head at the moment.

The audio mix is good and the picture quality varies but this is due to the limitations of Standard Def video and not any fault of the mastering. Most of it looks great but there are a few overly bright scenes and a few where the blacks don't hold but it doesn't at all take away from the show. If you like Camel you will love it, if you are into progressive rock give it a try. I used to say Camel was a bit like Yes mixed with Genesis (Trick of the Tail era) but with Pink Floyd vocals. Having said that for years it was funny when I head the Roger Waters met with Andrew Latimer and had him try out for the Gilmour parts when Waters was going to tour DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.

I've said enough. Buy it and keep Camel alive.",1292198400,15,1888,4.207182320441989

8422750,5,B004C39E3U,Product arrived early. Camel is a great group and should have been given a lot of recognition through the years. Well worth the purchase.,1492732800,,137,4.75
8422751,5,B004C39E3U,A well-received Christmas gift - thanks!,1420934400,,40,5.833333333333333
8422752,4,B004C39E3U,Not a sparkling stageshow but musically at their best. Well worth buying. Ment to be Camels farewell concert but now they are back touring.,1384128000,2,139,4.833333333333333
8422753,5,B004C39E3U,"I bumped into Camel's music about three years back and have been buying up all the CD's and DVD's. As of now I only, lack Rajaz and Live CD's (which is my next purchase) and Footage on the DVD's. These guys are GREAT!!! Both Andy's are fantastic but I have to say... Denis did a great job on the drums, what a basher. He did a great job on sound as well. I have not heard a bad CD/DVD yet... each one is different which is what I enjoy. I sure hope there's some more music coming our way soon.",1371427200,,493,3.94
8422754,5,B004C39E3U,"Everything about this disk was excellent; the playing, the song selection, the video and audio quality.  This is the way all band DVDs should be produced.  No silly graphics, interviews that interrupt the music, or other annoying extras that irritate me.  If you just want to hear good music played by good musicians, this is the ticket.  Camel was a tragically under-appreciated band.  Thankfully, some of their live work was recorded well for posterity.",1363392000,4,455,5.094594594594595
8422755,4,B004C39E3U,"The only way to explain the fact that Camel did not get the attention they deserve over the years, must be they were contemporaries of such monsters like Genesis, Yes, ELP just to name a few. Andy Latimer extraordinaire guitar playing can be compared to David Gilmour (bluesy style), and his vocals, even though not as singular as Gabriel, Anderson or other singers in the genre, is perfect for Camel's music. This DVD shows them playing on a small venue, as usual, in front of an audience of american fans, and the set is as always amazing, this time including songs from their latest album A Nod and a Wink (2002). Joining Latimer is his partner since 1984 Colin Bass on bass and vocals, Dennis Clement on drums (superb) and the same talented keyboard player that joined Yes on his symphonic DVD.
The only thing I missed was some back screen or any visuals on stage to complement the music which we all know, speaks by itself. Andy Latimer really deserves major recognition of his playing and contribution to the prog style. I hope it will happen before he passes away. Great band, beautiful heartfelt music. I only wish we could have more new songs to enjoy. Pay attention to the reaction of one particular guy in the audience after the song For Today (dedicated to the ones who lost their lives in 9/11). I was moved too. Long live to Camel one of my favourite bands ever.",1363132800,2,1376,4.55241935483871
8422756,5,B004C39E3U,"As a long-time Camel fan - growing up with them, buying every album, attending many concerts, listening to their songs over and over in true bliss - I can say that they have affected me like no other artists.  A truly under-appreciated group, but one with the constant guidance and influence of one of the best guitarists and performers ever.  My son and I were fortunate to be at this show and witness a small group of very enthused fans giving Andy and his mates their final send off.  This dvd captures much of the joy, incredible talent, and artistry that was present that night and I will enjoy watching it for years to come.",1330992000,2,630,4.460869565217391
8422757,5,B004C39E3U,"This was the first night of CAMEL's FAREWELL TOUR and I must say the sound and image quality is not as good previous releases like the magnificient COMING OF AGE.  I also miss material from recent albums (RAJAZ, HARBOUR OF TEARS and A NOD AND A WINK) although it is understandable why LATIMER and co. decided to play older numbers and keep their loyal fans happy.

Despite all of this, OPENING FAREWELL is another great release by CAMEL.  Colin Bass playing is as solid as it gets, the new keyboard player is very good (although the keyboards are not really present in the mix), Dennis Clement drumming is amazing and continues the fine tradition of great CAMEL drummers and Andy Latimer's guitar playing is as soulful and passionate as ever.  The rendition of LUNAR SEA alone is reason enough to buy this DVD.

Let's hope Latimer reconsiders his initial decision and may take the beast on tour again.",1320883200,2,901,4.677215189873418
8422758,5,B004C39E3U,"If you love the sound of the electric guitar, see this thing! Recorded as a test run before their (possibly) final live tour, this disc finds the UK quartet in top form, giving a fiery, emotional performance before a small, energetic audience.

In the '70's and '80's, Camel had the reputation of being colorful, creative, but not as dynamic and powerful as some of the top British artists of that day. Concert videos like 1984's ""Pressure Points"" featured songs built around stories of people caught in tough times (wartime England, Cold War Berlin, etc.) with arrangements including massed keyboards and a relatively laid back drummer. Their lyrics were a cut above and Andy Latimer's guitar skills were up there with the best of his peers.

After a break of quite a few years, Andy returned with a smaller, leaner Camel that dropped much of the lushness for a harder sound featuring power chords along with a more propulsive sound from the drum trap. ""Opening Farewell"" captures the 21st century Camel better than any other video. At this point (2003) Andy's guitar playing is on a level few in rock history can match and his genius for creating memorable melodic hooks shows in a strong set list that reaches deep into the band's body of work. I found his rapport with the audience and banter with long time bass player Colin Bass a nice bonus to the performance.

Also in the band are drummer Denis Clement, a cheerful young Canadian who pounds his drums with a fury that would make Keith Moon wince and an enormously talented keyboard player named Tom Brislin, whose high energy rock technique works well, despite being different from the jazzier sound Pete Bardens gave them in years past.

Although the sound is only stereo, it's a damn fine mix (by Denis) that begs to be played loud. Video is 4:3 ratio, but clear and colorful and the editing is quite good. No extras.",1319932800,,1878,4.73394495412844
