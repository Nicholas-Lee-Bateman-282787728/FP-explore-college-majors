2499412,5,B000E6ESG2,"HEY GUYS,

IT'S YOUR FRIENDLY DVD REPORTER HERE. (RICK). I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS SET TO BE RELEASED. I ALMOST PURCHASED THE EVOLUTION SET LAST MONTH UNTIL I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS SET COMING OUT. BUT, TO LET YOU KNOW. THEY MADE THIS SAME KIND OF SET FOR THE ALIEN QUADTRIOLOGY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. FOX ONLY RELEASED IT THERE. IT'S AN ALIEN HEAD THAT HOLDS THE DVD'S IN IT. I PURCHASED IT LAST MONTH AND IT IS TOTALLY COOL. IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT, YOU CAN FIND IT AT AMAZON. UK. JUST GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE AND CLICK ON UNITED KINGDOM AND ONCE THAT SITE PULLS UP JUST ENTER UNDER DVD SEARCH - ALIEN HEAD AND IT WILL PULL UP. YOU DON'T GET THE REGION 1 DVD'S, THEY ARE REGION 2 AND DON'T WORK ON AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS. HOWEVER IF YOU WANT THE COLLECTOR'S ALIEN HEAD YOU CAN BUY IT THERE. I FOUND THIS OUT BUY READING THIS REVIEW AND THEN DID SOME RESEARCH. PEACE.

We've got some major release updates for you today.

First of all, we have the official skinny from 20th Century Fox on their upcoming celebration of all things Planet of the Apes on DVD. The centerpiece of the affair will be the 3/28 release of the 14-disc, THX-certified Planet of the Apes: The Ultimate DVD Collection (SRP $179.98). Here's a disc by disc list of the extras, as confirmed by the studio:

As you can see, what's new in The Ultimate DVD Collection are the new anamorphic transfers of the four classic Apes films that have previously been available in letterboxed widecreen only, along with the complete animated TV series (its first appearance on DVD and exclusive to The Ultimate DVD Collection) and a couple new extras on the 1974 live-action TV series. All of this comes with a special ""ape"" display case designed to replicate the original mask designs from the classic films. This is the kind of packaging that Fox has previously released in Japan only (with I, Robot and The Alien Quadrilogy), so you've got to at least give the studio credit for making it available to U.S. fans as well (expensive though it is). Here's a picture of the packaging...",1139961600,4,2047,4.4361702127659575
2499413,5,B000E6ESG2,This is great news.  I also just seen they will be including the 92 minute tv version of Battle for the Planet of the Apes.  Before it was only available as the theatrical 86 minute version.  So this is definitely worth it if your a fan of the apes like me!,1139356800,7,257,4.0
2499414,4,B000E6ESG2,"They forgot to include the bonus disc that came with the special edition of ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"".  It would also have been interesting if they'd collected all the appearances Roddy McDowall made while in Apes makeup, like the Carol Burnett Show episode.",1137628800,13,264,4.866666666666666
2499415,3,B000E6ESG2,"The Planet of the Apes: Ultimate DVD Collection is both good and bad news.  The vast majority of people who are big enough fans to pay that SRP for this set already purchased the box sets for the movies and the TV series.  Now we have to by these all over again even if we don't care about the animorphic feature because the set includes TV promos for the Television series and the animated series currently not available elsewhere.  Even if FOX makes the animated series available separately (which I am not expecting because they want us to shell out more cash for this new release) those TV spots to me are very appealing.  Like Star Trek fans who felt they have been made fools out of by buying the original series in the two episodes in a package format and then follow up with releases of the season sets, I am really annoyed with FOX for pulling this stunt.  Why were the TV spots not placed on the original release of the TV series?  I can't help but think this was done intentionally.  By the way, despite what was said above, the season set of the TV series is not that difficult to find.  Anyhow, I feel as though I wasted my money now and will have to spend well over $100 just to get a few TV spots (and possibly the animated series which FOX will probably hold hostage exclusively to this set).  I expect to see countless copies of the previous releases on ebay in the months to come.  I am even now wondering where I can unload my own film and TV series box sets (which are just like new) but minimize the loss.  It is actually disgraceful when you think of all of the wasted money, packaging and DVDs that will now be looked upon as inferior and in some cases unwanted due to this new release.  Oh well, when it comes to greed what else is new.",1137542400,30,1760,4.252252252252252
2499416,5,B000E6ESG2,"This should be the set that every ""Apes"" fan wants. It collects every bit of ""Planet of the Apes"" ever committed to film, including all the episodes of the never-before-released animated series ""Return to the Planet of the Apes"" and the hard-to-find live-action television series that starred Roddy McDowell. All five of the original movies, plus the 2001 version, are presented in digitally remastered, animorphic widescreen and are THX certified. And there are tons of commentaries and extras, including the feature-length documentary ""Behind the Planet of the Apes.""

Disc 14: ""Planet of the Apes (2001)"" bonus disc, including 23 featurettes and six documentaries: Ape School, Makeup Testing, Costume Testing, Shooting on Location, Scoring the Film, and Ape Movement. Also included: eight interactive multi-angle sequences, four quad-angle/4-way audio split vignettes of makeup testing, apes reactive testing, costume testing, movement and stunt testing, five extended scenes, an HBO ""Making of"" special, TV spots, trailers, and a music video.

Quite a package for the true ""Apes"" fan. For those fans, like me, who have already purchased these films and the live-action series, I hope Fox will put out a separate set of just the animated series. I have been waiting a long time for that.",1137456000,139,4130,5.216012084592145
2499478,5,B000E6ESG2,"I never could justify the normally high cost of this set, but very recently FoxConnect.com had this on sale for $29.99.  Of course I had to jump on that deal!  It arrived today and I couldn't be happier!  The original movies were a huge part of my childhood, and having them all together plus the live action TV show and animated series is an Ape-Fan dream come true!  I haven't watched all of it yet, but having watched parts of the DVDs they look good.  Having it all come in a bust of Caesar is just marvelous!  The workmanship of the whole package is well worth it.  Pity, though, that the day after I ordered it, Fox Connect sold out of them.  I guess they were just trying to clear out some warehouse space.",1388361600,,713,4.268656716417911
2499479,5,B000E6ESG2,"Great set that includes the TV series as well.  This is just to alert potential buyers that this exact set is available at FoxConnect (foxconnect dotcom, you can search for the set), brand new for $29.99 as of 12/19/2013.

UPDATE:  It seems that the set is now sold out at FoxConnect.  Sorry.",1387411200,,292,4.5576923076923075
2499480,5,B000E6ESG2,"There should no other way to own the full collection.

A must have for any PotA fan or DVD/Blu-Ray collector.

It could also be used for pranks and scaring people.  That too is worth the price.",1386979200,,193,4.305555555555555
2499481,5,B000E6ESG2,Very satisfied! Very cool packaging for the Planet of the Apes collector. Was a perfect Christmas gift for my son!,1386028800,,114,4.75
2499482,4,B000E6ESG2,"This 14-disc DVD collection is still relevant because it includes the TV series, animated series and 2001 remake on extra discs. This Ultimate DVD collection is now out of print but worth tracking down for Apes collectors. The films and TV shows are all available on Blu-ray but broken up into two or more collections. This collection is pricey but has managed to hold its value extremely well.",1378857600,,394,4.8088235294117645
2499483,5,B000E6ESG2,"This set arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I was very surprised and pleased that it still had the original box, with only slight wear to the edges.  The bust is in absolutely beautiful condition, and the DVDs all seem to be just fine.  This is a great addition to my sci-fi collection, and I am very pleased.  Outstanding seller!",1359504000,,340,4.616666666666666
2499484,5,B000E6ESG2,"This is an outstanding collection.  It has everything ever associated with Planet of the Apes (Movies, TV Shows, Cartoons).  The only thing missing is the latest movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes (and that is because this was released before that movie).  Highly recommended.",1331424000,,278,5.0
2499485,3,B000E6ESG2,"Anyone shelling any amount of money for this set must be kidding themselves. The movies are child like in nature - unleee you want to see special effects. Save your money, like me, and wait unitl the powers that be release the original on Blue- Ray. Better yet, buy them and see them, speceially the original with Charlton Heston.",1312416000,,330,4.610169491525424
2499486,5,B000E6ESG2,"I bought this set in 2008 when Amazon had a gold box discount of $57.99.  I have to be honest I was not a huge fan of the movies, I remeber watching the first two with my dad when they were on TV on Saturdays when I was little, but other than that I never really got into them.  What got me was the sweet Ape head, it actually has hair.  I probably would have paid $60 for the ape head alone so to me it was like buy an ape head get a bunch of movies for free.  When I got it and pulled it out of the box it was everything I hoped it would be.  The movies were okay, an interesting piece of nostalgia, I have never watched the TV show, but I guess if you want the most complete set of all things Planet of the Apes it would probably be hard to find a better set.  This review is less about the movies and more about the ape head. I put it in an alcove that I had about 9 foot in the air which I think you are supposed to put plants or something.  It looks amazing sitting up there.  I have gotten many comments from people, a common example of the comments is, ""I think that looks scary, Why would you have that?""  and ""Wow you are an idiot why would anybody put that there have you ever even seen those movies?""  Basically in the end my thoughts on this product are it is one of the best purchases I have ever made, whether you want a charming centerpiece for a table or a conversation starter this will definitely do that.",1281657600,11,1424,3.9131944444444446
2499487,5,B000E6ESG2,I believe it was June of 2008 when amazon offered this set for $58.99. It would be pretty cool if they gave us another chance at that price.,1273449600,,140,4.035714285714286
2499520,5,B000E6ESG2,"The Ape Bust is super. It has a slot in back, under a green flap, where the DVD's can be stored.  It is very well made and large. A must for any scifi fan.",1269302400,,155,3.5588235294117645
2499521,4,B000E6ESG2,i am considering buying this because i loved all 5 ape films. i never knew there was an animated apes show until now. how cool is that? but the reason i gave 4/5 stars is that they included the inferior 2001 marky mark remake. when and if i buy this marky marks going bye-bye lol.,1267488000,,280,4.109090909090909
2499522,5,B000E6ESG2,"I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday, who was BEYOND thrilled!  I found the collection brand new without the outside shrink wrap for less than 1/2 the normal price.

Everything you could possibly want to see in a Planet of the Apes collection in an APE HEAD!  He is fuzzy and his uniform even has working zippers!

Let's just say, my bf's assertion that he has never had a gf that gives him decent let alone AWESOME gifts, has come to an end!",1229385600,3,450,4.258823529411765
2499523,5,B000E6ESG2,"For any PLANET OF THE APES FANS out there this collection is for you the video,sound is very good in this collection. I enjoyed this collection in fact its the best collection I've ever seen it ranks with the DIRTY HARRY ULITMATE COLLECTION I give both SETS 10 STARS and 10 THUMPS up get both before it becomes rare and hard to find.",1222214400,,333,4.301587301587301
2499524,5,B000E6ESG2,"The ultimate collection doesn't lie when you get mostly everything... Seriously, apes apes and more apes... and I couldn't be happier!  The ape bust is great for staring down employees around the desk for intimidation.  It has stopped workers in their walking paths everyday.  It's the glare of a determined ape which no man can escape.  I'm glad i made this purchase and have filled the ape void I have had since the first time I watched ""Planet of the Apes"".",1217548800,,460,4.6419753086419755
2499525,5,B000E6ESG2,"These movies are just a great slice of sci-fi pop culture. The original was still the best but the whole universe is fun to take in. I especially loved the cartoon collection, not because it was good, because it was so bad it was good. I had a blast going through it and i love the collectable angle of packaging it in the head of an APE.",1217462400,,338,4.059701492537314
2499526,5,B000E6ESG2,"You simply cannot beat this collection of Planet of the Apes DVDs.  It literally has every single thing you could possibly want.  It has the original movie, which was outstanding and really is the best individual movie of the entire genre.  It has all five of the sequels, which at times border on the cheesy, but if you are an Apes fan and loved them as a kid, you'll certainly want these as well.  It has the ENTIRE television series, which I loved as a kid.  It has all the animated (cartoon) series, which I don't care for too much.  And it has the 2001 remake of the original Planet of the Apes.  And finally, it has a disc with all bonus features.

All the discs are of very high quality reproduction with no problems.

You just can't beat having such a comprehensive collection that includes everything you would want if you are a Planet of the Apes fan, and then some.",1205798400,,876,4.3580246913580245
2499527,5,B000E6ESG2,"I purchased this for a Planet of the Apes fan.  I do not know a lot about the series but she was absolutely elated with the gift.  What was cool is that this has pretty much every movie and TV show.  At first I did not think that the latest movie was in the pack.  But, it was.

Definitely a good pick as a gift based on my experience.",1200787200,,335,3.7971014492753623
2499528,5,B000E6ESG2,"Wow! What a set! If you love POTA's Then you gotta have this set! All the films,TV episodes,documentaries and cartoons.....you name it,it's here! all remastered and looking great! It even comes in a very cool Caesar ape's head! The only thing they could have added is the director's cut of ""Conquest"". This is a must have for the ape fan! The original film is a classic, but the sequels vary in quality, unfortunately the budget was cut lower on each film and it shows! It's still a fun series.

Not only is every single filmed Apes project included (think about that for a moment, every single Apes project put to celluloid), not only are all the movies are anamorphic (squee), but it's all packaged in an authentic Ape head replica.  Maybe you gotta be geeky, but that's just freaking awesome!

I've displayed my Ape head in the living room for the time being and I get a kick out of the jumps and creeps it gives people.  Truly a set for the fans, completists and DVD collectors.",1171324800,6,532,4.3979591836734695

The best part - aside from having it all in one collection - is that they restored ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes."" I hated the version I owned in the Legacy Box Set because they had removed the scenes about the bomb. (If you're as big a fan as I, you know the scenes I mean.) I was furious about that, because those scenes are essential to tying the whole story together. But now that they are back- I am happy as a monkey in banana cream pie.

This really is the ULTIMATE collection for the ULTIMATE apes fan.",1167091200,4,637,4.213114754098361
2499543,5,B000E6ESG2,"To say that this set is the 'Ultimate' POTA collection seems pointless - look at the discription.  There's nothing ""Apes"" that ISN'T here.  As a fan of these films (and TV series) since I was a kid I was totally psyched when I read about this coming out.  I would have bought it if it was in a plain cardboard box.  But the packaging...an APE HEAD!  Even my wife (not a fan) was impressed by the sculpture.  I wondered why they chose Ceasar but if you think about the stories the movies tell he was the ape that started it all, so I guess it makes sense.

I had thought several times about collecting these films but something else always came up.  Now at last I can have it all for one decent price.  And I get an Ape head to boot!

Fox did justice to this wonderful series (but I won't get into the screw-job I got from the same company after buying the MASH seasons one at a time only to have a box set crammed with extras come out).",1163635200,4,936,4.093406593406593
2499544,5,B000E6ESG2,"This is the greatest and most complete collection ever released.  It not only contains all of the movies but, both the live action and animated TV shows.  I LOVE IT!!!",1163116800,,167,4.533333333333333
2499545,4,B000E6ESG2,"Let's make one thing clear - The only people devoted enough to shell out $180 for this collection are the same devoted fans that shelled out $90 to purchase the original DVD boxed set less than a decade ago.  So, in discussing this collection, it's less a question of whether the 14 discs are worth $12 a piece, and more a question of whether the 8 discs of new material are worth the $180 cost to upgrade.

To be clear, there's virtually no difference between the original and new DVD releases of the 5 Apes films.  The first film has a new menu (I don't like it, but at least this one doesn't give away the end of the film), and the last film has ten minutes of previously cut material that makes a nice connection to the second film.  Some will note that the five original films are now presented in Anamorphic Widescreen instead of Letterbox, but the difference won't be noticable unless you have a widescreen television.  Aside from these changes, everything else is the same...even the DVD menus.  Oh, and Fox has added two unskippable anti-theft statements at the begining of each DVD, which is quite annoying.

No new supplimental features have been added for any of the 5 films.  The only new feature to be found is on the Behind the Planet of the Apes documentary DVD, which now features silent behind-the-scenes footage of the first film as shot by Roddy McDowall, as well as a few 1968 promos for the first film and sparse behind the scenes footage of the third film.  The 2001 Planet of the Apes film also features a second disc of features, though I don't know if any of these are included in this set for the first time.  As for the the remaining Apes films, no new material has been added at all.  Each film DVD includes trailers for all six Apes films as their only special feature.  The 1974 television show and 1975 cartoon discs have no special features at all.

Here's a rundown of what Apes fans will recieve by upgrading to this new set:

The Caesar Bust package - Cute, but how many of us are really planning on displaying this in our living rooms?  Personally, I prefer the original DVD release packaging.  Much nicer to look at than the generic cardboard case that holds the DVDs within the bust.

Supplemental footage: Roddy McDowall silent footage, 1968 promos, and some behind the scenes footage for the third film - Only the most obsessive of Apes fans is really going to care much about this.

The complete 1974 Television Series (14 episodes) - A major bonus.  The series isn't as campy as you might expect.  It still makes excellent use of costumes and sets, as well.

The complete 1975 Cartoon series (13 episodes) - Another major bonus.  The cartoon is surprisingly well done and definitely worthwhile to a serious Apes fan.

The 2001 Apes film - You can find this for $5 in virtually any used DVD store.  Definitely not a major selling point for most.

Special features disc for the 2001 Apes film - You'd have to be a fan of the film to really care.

While I enjoy owning this set, I'm not sure I see the value.  I was able to acquire mine while Amazon was running a sale ($100 and free shipping for the set), which almost made sense to me (I'd probably pay $30-40 each for the 1974 TV series and 1975 cartoon series), but I'm just not sure you're getting a $180 value out of this collection, especially without the addition of any major supplemental features.

Think long and hard about this one before purchasing -- just how much is a hairy bust of Caesar worth to you?",1158969600,38,3508,4.473270440251572
2499546,5,B000E6ESG2,"The most comprehensive collection of Apes films TV shows and Animations I have ever laid eyes(and ears) on.  I got lucky with this one.  Most cult classics are not availilbe or ""currently unavailible since 1975"" or sum such rot.  Not only do you get the entire movie sequence epich with full anamorphic format but enhancements in sound(ALL films 5.1) and color corrections in video(I noticed more in this set than even the previous release of 35th PoP anaversery.  even the first and by far most important film got the video treatment and is bright and vivid as it should be. It is ALso DTS 5.1 now, as well as Dolbe Standard.  In addition the TV series with McDowel/Harper/Naughtan which is more detailed than the movies because of time and character developement. It is no different than the orange DVD release so I need not go into it.  And for the first time(in my meezly and deprived life of lame-o pollicical correctsters not wanting me to be subject to such a wonderful experience) you get the 1975 Animated series(ALL of it!)  By far the best Animated anything I've seen.(except for Star Trek).  In 1975 the final(worthwile anyway) release of Planet of the Apes was a deep and moving experience.  Yes Fred Flintstone's voice is in it, but the dialogue is far from comical and not Hanna Barbara-like simpletonistic in any way and he is beliveable as General/EXGeneral Urko. You almost pity him when he looses his rank(no Black/white ethical/moral nonsence here).  Most voices are familar to us 70's children, in countless other sat morning cartoons(mostly  Filmation and Hanna Barbara) characters like Blackstar(Filmation) who has Zira's unearthly voice as aliens as well as various crew on Star Trek animaton series, Superfriend's Aqua man=Ape sergent(also in 1974 TV series) and wonder woman(Astronaut Judy), and ""Astronaut""(for lack of a better title) Bill Stanton's voice sounds vaguely like the original robot head commander in the origianl Voltron series ""Red Lion"" and ""Air Team"" from the Japanese animae series.. ""Sea-team's voice is in here too.""  Austin Stoker who was in the Final movie is Astronaut Jeff(last name unspecified) and Fred Flintstone's voice who is hard to NOT recognize but is perfect for Urko.  The incidental music(AK) and sound FX is very Pink Panther-like with ""falling"" from the comical Pink Panthar seirs used as the Spaceship's compressors overdrive when crashing and the Pink Pantar's frequent Goouph! sound from hitting the ground when the poor cat got ""punched"" ""Run over"" or some other peril.(also used very cheaply in Matt Huston series) and the machinations of the Underdwellers(odviosul a Scooby Doo memory).  The muszak is very well done and not at all comical.  the Moogs are a bit overused at times to give that 70's sci-fi feel rather than Apes film fill but it is still awsome. The producers/directors of the Pink Panther show it in the sound and Pink Panthar-like psycadelic 60s drawings, very reminecent but beautiful and very detailed despite lack of animations this is gorgeous comic-style with just enough animation to make belevable.

2499547,5,B000E6ESG2,This set brings me back to my childhood. I remember seeing the films in the theater and the tv show and cartoon as a kid. the novelizations were the first real books i read. Also as a child all i could get then were 15 minute 8 mm adaptions of the films and the storys on record. Now 30 year later i can have it all and i have been going ape all weekend.  I love the movies and the social comentary is just as valuble today as it was then. It was also really cool to see the original cartoon although i could have done without the 2001 film. but im not complaning  this is the best dvd set i have ever seen. and best of all i get to reexpirience the movies and i get to be that 12 year old kid again who was going ape and driving my mother crazy,1148256000,4,745,3.831168831168831
2499548,5,B000E6ESG2,"With HD and Blu-Ray hitting the market, I was reluctant to get my stinking paws on this expensive set, but after breaking out my old non-anamorphic Evolution box set and watching it on my widescreen Cinema Display, it was immediately apparent that I was in dire need of an upgrade to hold me over.  The standard 4:3 letterbox transfers played as small unscalable windows within the confines of my 16:9 widescreen display and the audio was only in Dolby stereo surround which prompted me to take the plunge.  Now I could have just purchased the new anamorphic remastered Legacy box set for about a quarter of the cost but there was just no going part way.... if you're going to upgrade, you gotta go ALL THE WAY!

First of all, what true Apes afficianado could resist the limited collectible packaging of a 2-foot tall ape bust of Caesar?!?!  It is beautifully sculpted with soft ape-like hair and real cloth green shirt with zipper pockets and will instantly standout as the centerpiece of your collection.  The DVD box is cleverly stowed behind a velcro flap on the back of the shirt.  Limited to only 10,000 (mine is 2099) there surely won't be enough Ape Heads across the country to satisfy demand.  I guess for the inevitable HD box set (and you KNOW it is coming) they will probably package them in the Lawgiver Statue, a Dr. Zaius bust,  or maybe even the partially buried iconic remains of the Statue of Liberty (FOX, if you are reading this, I hope that you will seriously take this into consideration).

The transfers are finally all preserved in anamorphic widescreen and will scale correctly when viewed on a 16:9 widescreen display while preserving the original 2:35:1 theatrical aspect ratio so they still have a letterbox matte but without any cropping of the original frame.  I can now behold the breathtaking panoramic vistas of the Forbidden Zone in true anamorphic < < < W I D E S C R E E N > > >  glory!  The audio has been digitally remastered with Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS on the original Planet of the Apes that was included on the 35th Anniversary release which I thankfully didn't buy because it is included here.  All of the bonus material like trailers and marketing publicity for each film is included as well as the extensive Behind the Planet of the Apes documentary hosted by Roddy McDowall.  There is even an Easter Egg hidden under Ape Phenomenon on disc 2 which is an old Mego toy commercial of VERY poor VHS quality but is still a nice extra for nostalgic preservation.  In addition to the entire catalog of theatrical Apes films (including the blasphemous 2001 Tim Burton ""re-imagining"") it includes all 14 episodes of the television series and also 16mm film transfers of the 13 episodes from the never-before-released Return to the Planet of the Apes animated series (featuring the voice of Fred Flintstone as General Urko) which is only included in this set and is another major consideration to upgrade your collection.

This set has everything to satiate even the most fervent Ape appetites.  If you are holding off for HD, then you are denying yourself a truly remarkable piece of historic Apes memorabillia.  I will gladly pay for another remastered HD box set at some point but for now, this Standard Def box set is enough to keep me entertained until they arrive. Unlike Taylor, however, it probably won't take us 2000 years (give or take a decade) to return to the Planet of the Apes.",1147392000,17,3430,4.6883333333333335
2499549,5,B000E6ESG2,"Since I discovered this series following the Original Airing of the AMC ""Behind"" Production - I have been supremely infatuated with this highly underrated series.

2499570,4,B000E6ESG2,"Any meditation on early 1970's child pop culture would be incomplete without Planet Of The Apes.

It was among the mix with Star Trek, Space:1999, Six Million Dollar Man, Monster and Godzilla movies for those kids that had a taste for Sci-Fi.

The toys, mainly the action figures and playsets by Mego were on Birthday and Christmas lists (and you could have the Star Trek figures hang out with them because they were made by Mego too). The movies were kid ""events"" when they came to TV.

Of course, as you get older, you start to see the subtle (and not so subtle) socio-political comment in the Ape movies and you enjoy the movies (and shows) in ways beyond entertainment and nostalgia.

The Planet Of The Apes Phenomena fizzled in the middle 70's to ultimately be buried by Star Wars. Still, they stand as solid examples of 1970's movie and TV Science Fiction, are loved by a loyal group of fans and have a rock solid place in pop culture.

The history of Apes on Video goes right back to the beginning of it. Planet Of The Apes was among the first prerecorded videos released by Magnetic Video who contracted with 20'th Century Fox in 1978.

Throughout the years, Apes movies have seen releases on video, laserdisc and finally DVD.

When the first DVD's came out a few years ago, they were among the last to not be put on DVD in anamorphic widescreen. Instead, they were letterboxed widescreen which didn't allow good viewing on 16:9 TV's.

At the time, that was just fine for me since I had a run of the mill 4:3 TV. Now I have a 4:3 TV with anamorphic squeeze and the non anamorphic Apes stuck out like sore thumbs with less line resolution then what I became used to.

Now comes the Ultimate DVD collection with all films anamophically remastered and putting together most all the stuff released about POTA before on DVD and adding (for the first time) the animated show.

Planet Of The Apes gets the best treatment with a whole extra disc with the comprehensive AMC documentary Behind The Planet Of The Apes and other material. The movie and bonus disc is identical to the special edition released before.

The first movie, adapted by Rod Serling from the novel ""Monkey World"", in retrospect plays like the most elaborate ""Twilight Zone"" episode ever. With the shocking twist that time has somewhat blunted but is no less clever, Serling effortless weaves social comment into the fantastic happenings.

The Ape makeup at the time was revolutionary and it all was in a Simian city with uniquely different production design.

One funny thing about this movie (as well as many of the Apes movies that follow) is that while most these days would peg it at a hard PG or PG-13, the first three Ape movies were rated G.

This, despite the fact that in the first movie, there is a lot of violence and some male nudity. The second and third movie had their share of violent and scary happenings too.

I can only conclude that the way the MPAA was at the time that they considered Talking Apes attacking humans to be too fantastic to be taken seriously and declared it ""fantasy violence"". Also they must of figured the Male nudity did not matter because it was non sensual.

Next up is Beneath The Planet Of The Apes. Some hold this sequel in low regard but I have always liked it. The images of scared mutants, the scenes of post atomic NYC, with buildings that looked like ransacked jigsaw puzzles and the grim ending always stuck to me.

What I do see now is the heavy use of pullover ape masks in crowd scenes. I don't know why they decided to have pullover ape masks all have a slack jawed, gaped mouth look. If they were all made with closed mouths, they would gone less noticed.

From there we go to Escape From The Planet Of The Apes. Cornilius and Zira arrive in modern (well, modern back in 1973) America. It's easily the best and most enjoyable of the sequels. In the first half Cornilius and Zira experiencing aspects of our culture. Then, like the first two movies, it all ends on a tragic note when the government begins to see the danger they (or more specifically, their unborn child) bear to the future.

Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes comes next, set some 20 years later in a totalitarian America of enslaved Apes at the verge of speech. Because of the similarity between the Apes revolution and the Watts riots still fresh in people's mind, the MPAA gave the first PG to an Apes movie. Also, some of the ending dialog was altered for a slightly more upbeat ending.

Battle of the Planet Of The Apes is easily the least of the franchise. But it is made slightly better on this new version with the inclusion of some deleted scenes first seen in network showings and later on Japanese laserdisc. It is also interesting to note that this movie had really, the first post apocalyptic battle using abandoned cars (and other vehicles, like a school bus in this case) that would become a cliche' after ""The Road Warrior"". Apes did it first.

With Battle, they seemed to get more careless with the makeup. Unlike most of the time before, Ape actor's teeth were not painted black to hide them beneath the false teeth attached to the appliences. And in a key scene where Caeser shouts ""Now, fight like Apes!"" Roddy's lower mouth piece is almost falling off (and his real teeth are in full view). This is why there is a smudge on the picture. It was added optically to try to hide this but does not succeed (and it was used in the trailer).

All the Ape movies are anamorphically remastered with pretty good results. But that's not to say thier age does not show in spots.

20'th Century fox is at work on making a full film restoration to Planet Of The Apes (I saw a print with the pieces restored so far recently). But the Apes films here all are done with video based restoration which is fine for DVD.

I should also mention here that all films have a remixed 5.1 soundtrack but also have the option of original mono. I often choose the mono as that was how the films were released. The 5.1 gives improved sound to the score if not that much more directionality to rest of the soundtrack.

This set also has the complete live action Planet Of The Apes TV show. It wasn't a hard feat since it lasted only 14 episodes.

The show is actually more similar, plot wise, to The Fugitive. Two Human Astronauts with an Ape friend (Galen, played by Roddy McDowall) work to evade capture by General Urko and Dr, Zauis. During which they encounter different groups of people and apes with different challenges.

Unlike the movies, the other humans in this show can talk too, although they are still slaves to the apes.

In order to gain syndication revenue, Fox ended up pairing up a number of episodes of the show into several TV movies with names like ""Life, Liberty and Pursuit Of The Planet Of The Apes"".

Some have said Roddy McDowall filmed additional material in Galen Makeup in 1981 for these TV movies. It's been so long since I've seen them I can't remember if that's true or not. If it is, it should've been included on this set. Also, early information for this set also mentioned that there would be TV spots and stills for the show. They are not included but somehow I figured it was a mistake and was not surprised. The transfers are the same as it was with the original release of this show, pretty good considering the age.

For what it was POTA: The TV show was pretty good. Roddy McDowall was especially fond of playing Galen since he had so much more time to develop the character then he had for Cornilius and Milo/Caeser.

Same goes for Return To The Planet Of The Apes, the 1975 Saturday Morning Cartoon. This rarely shown cartoon, was taped by me in the late 1980's off of WPIX on Saturday Morning. It turns out I was lucky because many an Ape fan has had their money ripped off with absolutely awful looking bootleg tapes and DVD's from Ebay just for a chance to glimpse the show. If they didn't come from edited Sci-Fi channel showings then they usually came from murky, awful sources.

I never would've believed that the Apes Cartoon would see legitimate DVD before the Star Trek cartoon would, but that's exactly what happened (and proves just how asleep at the wheel Paramount is with the Trek Franchise).

So far, unlike the rest of the stuff, the cartoon is exclusive to this set (for now at least, Fox has said it will release it separately in the future).

The cartoon is produced by the same people that did the Pink Panther cartoons (DePatie and Freling) and has yet another three astronauts (Bill, Jeff and Judy)land in Ape land.

Although this is a slightly more advanced ape world. The apes have cars, and (primitive 1950's looking) television. This Ape world also has giant mutated spiders, a prehistoric bird and a pacifist ape sect that is looked over by a giant King Kong style ape that they worship. B Monster movie stuff that us kids would eat up.

Not to mention the titles of the episodes which read like the attention grabbing titles of those same B movies. ""Flames Of Doom"", ""Lagoon Of Peril"", ""Terror on Ice Mountain"" and so on.

The cartoon is in a semi serial format. For instance, Judy seemed to be swallowed up by a Forbidden Zone illusion of the Earth opening up only to turn up again with the Underground dwellers in the third episode. Still, they fail to retrieve her until a later episode.

The cartoons are barely animated, taking the term ""limited animation"" to the legal limit sometimes. But the artistic style is really nice, with many high contrast renderings that remind me of comic book style art.

The show also avoids the cute and/or young character put in the the show because it was for kids.

The voices on the show include Austin Stoker (who was in Battle for The Planet Of The Apes and the original Assault on Precinct 13)as the Astronaut Jeff and Henry Corden as General Urko. Henry Corden took over the voice of Fred Flintstone after Alan Reed died. Therefore, you can hear a lot of ""Fred Flintstone"" in General Urko's voice. It's a little bizarre.

It appears that fox used pre-existing transfers for most of Return. They lack the look of a full high definition remaster like was done for most of Spiderman the 1967 cartoon.

The print quality on these old school transfers is colorful but worn looking. It will still be better than anything you can get bootleg but not a home run by any means.

But at 3 episodes: ""Tunnel Of Fear"", ""River Of Flames"" and ""Mission Of Mercy"" that have undergone the full high definition transfer treatment. These episodes are so clear you can often see the brush strokes on the art and they are cleaned up nice too.

I don't know why they remastered only a few shows without doing the whole thing. Perhaps they were unable to locate 35mm prints for most of the shows and if so, it just isn't worth it to do a high def transfer of 16 mm if you already have a fairly decent transfer already on hand. Or perhaps those are High def transfers of 16mm prints. Who knows?

Whatever the case may be, I'm glad at least a few got the better treatment to at least give a good representation of the art in the series.

!UPDATE! It would now appear that the old school transfers being on this set were only there because most of the new transfers weren't ready when the head set was to be released. Fox did, as promised, release the cartoon series seperately and on this release all the shows are remastered and carry the next week previews. Although I am glad that these remastered versions are available they should've been the ones buyers of this set got. Now you have to buy this seperate release if you *really* want to have the Ultimate collection. At a $15 price point (and probabaly less than that as time passes and secondary sellers offer it) it's not too big a deal but it's doesn't take away from the fact that Ape Head set buyers were entitled to it from the beginning !UPDATE!

Finally, there is the 2001 remake by Tim Burton duplicating the 2 discs of the original 2 disc release. I haven't looked at it yet.

While I thought the remake was okay, it doesn't demand repeat viewings by me as the older films do. One day, I'm sure I will check it out.

The 14 DVD's in total are put into a small fold open plastic tray case that does a good job of holding the discs and allows for easy finding of the disc you want.

It all goes into a compartment in the back of this 2 foot Ape head bust. It resembles and is dressed like Caeser.

For a long time, I have seen the things that was done with packaging for multi disc sets in Japan and wishing we could have something like that in the US.

Well, with Apes, it has come to pass. The head is made of hard vinyl or plastic is nicely painted with real (well, real synthetic) applied hair and the green jumpsuit on the bust is represented by real fabric and zippers. The likeness to Caeser is a little off with the face being a little more narrow than in real life. The hair is set a little too close to the face as well. But overall, It is a nice representation of the Apes makeup.

It makes a nice conversation piece in the very least. But if you are somehow disenchanted with the head, the case with the discs goes very nicely onto the shelf while you can store the head somewhere seperately(maybe in the huge box and styrofoam packing it comes in).

But it shows everything comes full circle. At least for those that grew up with Apes as a part of thier pop culture tapestry. The Ape head with all the movies is like a huge toy. Something you can look at to see the detail in the makeup (which it was sculpted from). I think the face is a little bit too narrow for Roddy McDowall but it is still nice to have an up close look at a close to life size representation of the Apes makeup.

If I had a choice of getting all the discs without the head, I'm not sure if I would've gotten it but since it's here, it ain't going nowhere.

The movies (the updated anamorphic remasters) are available seperataly, as is the TV show (in exactly the same way as it is on this set) and the 2001 2 disc set.

What this set gives you is a unified set of discs with matched labeling and the cartoon series (that is promised to someday be released seperataly) in a unique (to say the least) package.

For those that have been waiting for the right time to plunge into the Planet Of The Apes, this is a no brainer. Long time Ape fans who have gotten the previous DVD's will have most everything here and will have to decide for themselves if the cartoon and the deluxe head make it worth the purchase (since the anamorphic remasterings are available seperataly).

If only they added some more to the extras (like really having those TV spots and addtional versions of trailers and TV spots for the movies and the rumored material shot for the TV films) that eclipse what had been in release before, it would be more of a must for Ape fans who have kept up with the DVD releases in the past.",1144368000,79,14923,4.4390779363337

2499572,5,B000E6ESG2,"I've seen these movies numerous times since I was a child, and every time a revisit them (particularly the original), I get something new out of them.  Why these movies are still relevant today is clear:  We are the apes, and the apes are us.  Intellegent design...The War in Iraq...Terry Schiavo...Sadly, Planet Earth is still being run by a bunch of d*** dirty apes.  After forty years, the monkeys are still in charge.

The jewell of this collection is, of course, the 67 original.  For the few if any out there who haven't seen it, I will say that it contains perhaps the best ending of any sci-fi film in history.  The other films are not nearly as good ,especially the crappy Tim Burton film, the absolute worst in this collection.  Still, they are all entertaining in there own way.  I especially look forward to watching both the live action and animated TV series, neither of which I've seen in over 30 years.

The ape head case is cool, I'll admit, but its also far too geeky to display in my living room.  I wish the films themselves were put in DVD size cases instead of CD size jewel boxes, so that I could put my films in my DVD collection and put the ape head in the closet.  But its really no big deal.  Since there are only 10,000 of these being produced, I guess I ruined its potential value by even opening it.  Oh well...",1143763200,3,1341,4.376518218623482
2499573,5,B000E6ESG2,"My set arrived today, and words can't say how happy I am with it.  If you're thinking of buying this, you're already familiar with the material on the discs, so what I want to do is talk about the special packaging.

The #1 concern with something like this is how the discs are stored.  Sometims the casing of a big set will open at a place that leaves a bad and obvious seam in the pacakaging, and it distracts from the look.  In this case, the shirt on the back of the figure lifts up from 2 velcro tabs, and the discs are in a box that slides out.  PERFECT!  No distraction from the look of the figure at all.

The next major concern would be the condition of the discs.  The more discs, the higher the risk of one popping out and getting scratched, right?  Not here.  The discs are in a very compact box, and there is absolutely no chance of them popping out and getting scratched up on the holding hub.

Next up is the packaging of the package itself.  The last thing you want is for your outer casing to be damaged.  The head is packed in a styrofoam block, which is then packed in a box, with a PotA slipcover, and all of that is put securely in another box.  This is an extremely well-packaged set!

Finally, the storage aspect.  Since the discs are in their own little box inside the bust, you can take the box out and place it on your DVD shelf, and either display the bust separately or box it back up if you don't have the room.

I really can't recommend this set enough!",1143676800,9,1483,4.165492957746479

This set will not disappoint.  I received it today, and have to say that the case is bigger than I thought it would be.  The ape head isn't life size, but it's close.  The movies are hidden under a flap in the back of the ape bust's shirt and are easy to access unlike the Alien Quadrilogy that made you unfold the box 20 times to reach the first disc.  The only thing that I would have wanted would be special features for all the films, but I'm sure that if any more features existed, they would have been included.  The first film is the same DVD that was released last year, but all the other DVDs are the first anamorphic transfers for the other films.

2499575,4,B000E6ESG2,"This is a phenomenal collection housed in a magnificent, collectible case. The only reason for the 4 star rating is that the lacks a few vital bits of footage (enumerated in another review on this page), preventing it from being the ""definitive"" Apes collection for ""completists."" That said, I thought I would make an additional comment as well as a suggestion.

COMMENT: The first two discs in the set replicate the 35th Anniversary Edition of the original PoTA, which was issued on DVD a couple of years ago. Discs 7-10 replicate the previously released DVD edition of the TV series, while discs 13-14 replicate the two discs that were included in the 2-Disc Special Edition of Tim Burton's remake. Only discs 3-6 (the newly remastered editions of the 4 theatrical sequels) and 11-12 (the animated series) include content that was previously unavailable in the North American DVD market.

SUGGESTION: (Careful, this includes spoilers!) Don't just sit down and view the discs in order. If you want to gain a greater appreciation for the powerful story arc of the PoTA saga as depicted in the theatrical films, watch them in the following order: Escape, Conquest, Battle, Planet and Beneath. (Or, in terms of this set, Discs 4, 5, 6, 1 and 3.) In this way, you would follow the chronology of the saga in Earth time, beginning with the arrival of the apes from the future. You would be spared the disappointment of concluding the films with the anti-climactic Battle for the Planet of the Apes, easily the weakest of the  theatrical films, and would instead conclude your viewing with Beneath the Planet of the Apes, the most fitting way to end your PoTA movie experience via the most powerful (and most bleak) final moments of perhaps ANY mainstream Hollywood studio release.

Some sort of printed booklet would've been nice but hey ... you get an ape's head!",1406073600,,503,4.164948453608248
8106448,1,B000E6ESG2,The bust of Caesar that housed the cds was not included with the set as stated in the description.  After I purchased it I was told they can't guarantee that study guides etc. Would be included.  They should have stated that in the description.  I would've purchased it elsewhere if I knew that wouldn't be included.  Very disappointed ! ! !,1406073600,,341,4.540983606557377
8106449,5,B000E6ESG2,A must have collectible for all true POA fans!  The ape head is very displayable.  Great box art graphics as well.,1394668800,,114,4.380952380952381

To start off with, this set is bundled inside a big figure of an ape's head, presumably Cornelius or Caesar. The DVD set is in the back of the head. The set contains 14 discs!! Here's what the discs consist of:

1. Planet Of The Apes (1968) Movie
2. Planet Of The Apes (1968) Special Features
3. Beneath The Planet Of The Apes
4. Escape From The Planet Of The Apes
5. Conquest Of The a Planet Of The Apes
6. Battle For The Planet Of The Apes
7. Planet Of The Apes (1974 Show) Disc 1
8. Planet Of The Apes (1974 Show) Disc 2
9. Planet Of The Apes (1974 Show) Disc 3
10. Planet Of Te Apes (1974 Show) Disc 4

12. Return To The Planet Of The Apes Disc 2
13. Planet Of The Apes (2001) Movie
14. Planet Of The Apes (2001) Special Features

If you already have the Legacy Collection, you're missing the 1974 show, the 1975 cartoon show (Return To) and the 2001 remake. It's up to you to decide to purchase it for just these though. Although it doesn't look like this set has the documentary Behind The Planet Of The Apes, it's located on disc 2. Thus set has EVERYTHING made under the Planet Of The Apes name. I already had the Legacy Cillection when I opened a BIG present for Christmas a few years ago to find this set from my wife. I wound giving the Legacy Collection to my parents who love the series like me.

Overall, I LOVE this set. Get it if you feel you're getting your money's worth with what you already have. If you have no POTA on DVD, GET THIS!!!",1392336000,,1667,4.08868501529052
