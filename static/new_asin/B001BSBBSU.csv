3498750,2,B001BSBBSU,"This disc consists of a very young Shirley Temple and other children acting in adult situations.  It is meant to be comedic, but I find it disturbing. I would not have ordered this had I known specifically what its content was.",1442188800,,227,4.536585365853658

3498758,5,B001BSBBSU,"Decent collection of her toddler shorts, showing her first introduction to American audiences. Shorts are clever and quite well written, Our Gang type of subject matter.

It's a emotion to have all films of Shirley. The biggest movie star of all time. It 'amazing to see how Shirley to 4 years old already knew acting, dancing, singing ... thanks to mother of Shirley who was able to enroll her Meglin's Dance School of Los Angeles.

3498782,5,B001BSBBSU,"I love these Shirley Temple movies, especially the early years.  Quality is pretty good, sound okay.  Colorization was very good.  Can't decide if I like color or black and white better.  This is a lot better than the individual movies I taped off the late-night TV, editing out commercials.  Now my collection takes up a lot less space.",1394236800,,337,4.741379310344827
3498783,5,B001BSBBSU,This was a great resource for my granddaughter entertainment needs. I looking forward to review other items on your list in the near future.,1393804800,,140,4.875
3498784,5,B001BSBBSU,"In today's sea of blithering rot in children's television and film, this little set is so refreshingly hilarious and original and clean! I remember watching some of these shows as a child and loving them. Now my four children request to watch these DVDs over and over again. You will not regret introducing your children to these classics.",1392336000,,339,4.862068965517241
3498785,2,B001BSBBSU,"I thought is was more movies with her singing and dancing...........it was more skits that she did
I bought it for my 4 yr. old grand daughter she wasn't too interested!",1388793600,,169,4.483870967741935
3498786,1,B001BSBBSU,Unwatchable. Turned it off after five minutes. Even my mother who requested Shirley Temple dvds for Christmas did not like it.,1388448000,,126,5.0476190476190474
3498787,4,B001BSBBSU,I had expected more dancing and singing.  Quality was good - color added a lot to it. Granddaughter that I bought if for - loved it.,1383264000,,132,4.076923076923077

3498789,4,B001BSBBSU,"i always enjoyed, and still do enjoy, the Shirley Temple movies. A talented little girl, Shirley always made me smile, after the obligatory teary parts of her movies. This shows the short clips of her earliest work. This is before child labor laws. She steels the scene every time. Though the subject matter of these shorts are very dated, the talent of this little girl comes through. These were very fun to watch. They are a bit strange, so keeping the time in which they were made in mind is required.",1380153600,,504,4.549450549450549
3498790,1,B001BSBBSU,"When I read about this product I was under the impression it was three of her early movies including Hiedi. I was very disappointed when I received this DVD instead. I was looking forward to sharing the early year movies with my grandchildren in this generation. Even my grandchildren would not enjoy this well maybe if they are about 1year to three. So bottom line the little flicks are fine for that age group I'm giving it a terrible rating because of the way it was advertised. Very misleading.
 Either I misunderstood your add completely or it was very misleading.",1379635200,,569,4.69
3498791,1,B001BSBBSU,"I thought Shirley was all about singing and dancing, but not in this one.  I couldn't understand what they were saying and I don't think they ever danced.  Very let down.",1373414400,,170,4.451612903225806
3498792,1,B001BSBBSU,"I was very disappointed with the content of the DVD. I made an assumption that any Shirley Temple would be child appropriate
so I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter. A few minutes into the story, Shirley temple, child star was strutting
across the screen  in a Mae West style. I  was shocked. Totally un-appropriate for children.. No more Shirley Temple material for me..  Truly sorry about that since my granddaughter is enrolled  in dance.
One cannot judge a book by its cover !",1369008000,,487,4.627906976744186
3498793,4,B001BSBBSU,"I liked the early years, I didn't relized how young she started to be in the movies.  I movie came on time as expected and in very good condition.  Thanks",1365379200,,154,4.1
3498794,2,B001BSBBSU,"I did not like it, her acting was great but the plays were too adult for a child, They were probably meant to be funny but I thought there were tasteless.",1364947200,,154,4.0
3498795,4,B001BSBBSU,"This 2-disc set is wonderful and ""A MUST BUY"" for Shirley Temple fans. It shows Miss Temple in nine of her earliest works. Seven of her eight ""Baby Burlesk"" Series one-reel short films, produced in 1933-1934, are on disc one. Disc two has one complete ""Frolics of Youth"" Series 2-reel short film: ""Merrily Yours"". The other film, entitled ""Our Girl Shirley"" appears to be a (1942?) colorized compilation of two 1934 ""Frolics of Youth"" films (""Pardon My Pups"" & ""Managed Money""). Also included on disc two is the documentary entitled ""Biggest Little Star"".",1361145600,,555,4.978494623655914
3498796,5,B001BSBBSU,"I bought this for my Granddaughter, she  really enjoys Shirley Temple.
This collection is real vintage Shirley Temple . When I was just a child I would watch them with my Mother who also was
a fan of Shirley Temple from movies of her youth. Some of these episodes I have never seen.

Though It was not really the most interesting for me as I'd rather be watching the Lone Ranger Or Captain Video, it was
the early days of TV so there wasn't a lot of choice and it was something that Me and Mom could watch together.

I seems to have real appeal the young girls who like my Grandaughter like Shirley and her adventures.",1358812800,,618,4.264957264957265
3498797,5,B001BSBBSU,My little neighbor loves every episode on these disks.  Even the adults enjoy them!  We were happy to find it at such a reasonable price.,1358208000,,137,4.44

3498799,3,B001BSBBSU,"Had no plots, just child play. Couldn't make any sense out of it. I was looking for more like the good ship lollipop and the colonels daughter",1351641600,,142,4.296296296296297
3498800,1,B001BSBBSU,I watched Shirley Temple when I was young I don't ever remember seeing movies like this. Maybe it was before my time. I am 50 years old. My 4 year old daughter is learning tap. I thought she would be encouraged by another small girl performing so well. Less than one minute of any dancing. There were so many children scantily dressed in those movies. I believe this was the early version of child porn. I would not let my daughter watch the early movies at all. We were purchasing the movies strictly to watch her tap dancing technique.,1343520000,,537,4.434343434343434
3498801,3,B001BSBBSU,"I so wanted to view thes with my great niece and nephews.  I was previewing them to make sure all was in working order.  It was not. The volumn 2 was great and played all the way through without any problems;however, the volumn 1 never did start.  I cleaned my machine, wiped the disk with a soft cloth reinserted several times and then I held it up to the light and to my astonishment I think there is nothing on the disk at all. no imprinting grooves are there.  the price is so low on this one I am tempted to buy another one just to see if I can get volumn 1, but I am afraid that a second one may have the same issues.",1342742400,,623,3.9206349206349205
3498802,1,B001BSBBSU,"I was expecting her movies, but these are just short shows with little kids trying to act like adults. Being a conservative person, I was surprised at the content. I don't think kids should be flirtacious and having scenes in bars. Some of it was downright offensive which shocked me.",1339027200,,284,4.7
3498803,5,B001BSBBSU,"I bought this movie for my Great grand children, they loved it!! There are no movies like this for children today. Film producers have lost the moral responsibility to furnish kids movies that teach,love, respect, humility and decency. Nothing but filt and discusting relations between people. What happened?
It was a wonderful movie. B. Ridgway",1322438400,,345,5.290909090909091
3498804,3,B001BSBBSU,The DVDs came in a timely manner and in good condition. The video quality wasn't great but they are very old movies so I am not sure what I should expect great quality.,1318291200,,168,4.121212121212121

3498807,5,B001BSBBSU,If you're the type that loves colorised movies then Legend have done an excellent job on these vintage Shirley Temple shorts.  The picture clarity is great and the colorisation process makes so much more detail appear.  I have watched some of these shorts several times before in black and white and yet while watching them today in color I was noticing little details that I have NEVER noticed before.  Highly recommended to all Shirley Temple fans as well as lovers of old films and even Tarzan fans will get a real kick out of her Kid 'n Africa adventure.  Hope Legend films continues the great work of converting the old b&w classics into colorful treats for modern viewers.,1293580800,,678,4.720338983050848

3498809,5,B001BSBBSU,"Anyone interested in the career or films of Shirley Temple would be well served to pick up this particular compilation package, the Early Years I and II.  Both discs contain rare or previously unreleased shorts from Shirley's personal archives, all of which have been completely re-mastered to enhance image quality and colorize their once grayscale images, and all are bundled at an unbeatable price (almost half as expensive as buying the two discs separately, and cheaper still than letting Amazon do the bundling for you).

Shirley herself presents these wonderful shorts, including the best of the Baby Burlesks that launched her career and some behind-the-scenes material done in the style of an old-fashioned newsreel.  At risk of repeating my Amazon reviews for each separate disc, I can say with conviction that the superior quality of the discs' production (due to the aforementioned re-mastering) makes this package a curiously strong value for the money.",1228176000,,966,5.300653594771242
