7984782,1,B00008K79B,"The 3-D was so bad that you couldn't even tell it was filmed in 3-D.  All attempts at using 3-D were blurry and out of convergence, so no perception of depth whatsoever.  I am a 3-D afficiondo, so I know how to set up the TV for it.  The movies were useless, the story horrible, and the humor unfunny.  Almost no nudity despite supposedly being a ""softcore porn"" flick.  This was the worst waste of money that I have ever experienced.",1132963200,,434,4.308641975308642

7984784,2,B00008K79B,"I saw the lollipop girls last year at a midnight showing in Houston. I liked it mainly because the wacky storyline and 3d sex. The sex itself wasn't great, but the fact that it was in 3d was a cool idea. The line to get tickets was so long that when I got in the theater, I had missed the first 10 min and after seeing it, I wanted to see it again. So I went online to see if it was on video. Then I found out M3D the movie was coming to DVD. I had heard that it was ""edited"" and the box cover said ""Unrated Director's Cut"" Usually when something comes to DVD, they put in all the good stuff they couldn't publically show in theaters and seeing how this was re-edited and unrated, I was thinking this would be cool. So I order it and 2 weeks later  I get the movie and watch it. I was so confused by this movie because M3d is very different than the original Lollipop girls. They put all these clips in that look like they are from the 80s into the movie and the story is pretty different. If you see this movie, just know most of the clips that don't have a fuzzy/gritty (and sometimes 3d) look were all the re-edit[s]  they used. I guess I can't blame them because if they took out the sex, the movie would be like 45 min long. All I have to say is you can't cut sex out of porn films and ASTERIX should release the theatrical version instead of this ""soft-core"" crap. The only real way this movie is enjoyable is if your drunk or high. The original Lollipop girls was good and enjoyable.
The playmates - I don't know much about this one, but again, they cut out the sex and killed this movie too!
If they ever re-release these 2 films in their original theatrical cuts without any editing, I would recommend buying it. Don't waste your time unless you are really bored.",1062547200,8,1772,4.133333333333334
7984785,3,B00008K79B,"M3D! was originally released as LOLLIPOP GIRLS IN HARD CANDY and later as SCORING. The M3D version is a softcore version while the original was more explicit. The 3-D is pretty bad on this one, and the film isn't half as funny as the writers seem to have thought it was. The audio commentary by some fan is pretty awful!
 THE PLAYMATES is probably the more interesting of the two films in the set and it also makes better use of 3-D, which isn't high praise as we are looking at the the inferior red/blue stuff here, not the more traditional polarized technique. There are some decent gimmicks and depth on display, which is good as the story makes no sense at all.
Also available in the same bad Deep Vision (red/blue) 3-D are WILDCAT WOMEN and BLONDE EMMANUELLE (a.k.a DISCO DOLLS IN HOT SKIN). The latter features a commentary by the star.
These are only interesting from a historical perspective and if you are a student of sexploitation films that doesn't mind watching truncated versions of porn films in awful red/blue 3-D.",1061856000,4,1030,4.628415300546448
7984786,5,B00008K79B,"For those of you out there who have no idea about this film, let me tell you!  I have not yet seen this dvd, but A few years back at the Spectrum Theatre in Albany they had a 3d film festival and this was the last one they showed. We all thought why was this m3d rated nc17? So we dogpiled into the car on a Sunday night and saw one of the stupidest and funniest films of my entire life!!!!! (Went back I think 3 or 4 times) M3d is basically a wonderful porn ""MOVIE"" from the 70s from back when they made these things with a plot.  Intercut into the very beat up film was some semi hardcore footage of people like Joey Silvera and John Holmes doing some offshore drilling :And that in 3d from the third row- I had a black eye for a week and a half!  But anyway, I had never thought I'd see this out in any format, and for real it is one of my favorite movies.  The plot involves a candy company that used to process toxic waste and if they don't come up with a winning product than the evil waste plant owners will buy back the company.  Enter the LOLLIPOPS!  An absent-minded scientist comes up with a putrid aftershave lollipop that is just horrible until a gladiator parachutes into the film and spills his thermos of yak's tail soup into the secret formula- and voila!  So, not knowing this, the candy people decide the best way to get rid of this candy is to throw it out of airplanes, giving the filmmakers a good enough excuse to show footage of Lifesaver Lollipops being dropped at the cameraman, and innocent topless bored housewives around ubiquitous swimming pools a decent enough reason to ""seduce"" hapless pizza boys (nudge nudge).  But this movie is so much fun that you'll be yelling things at the screen just like the entire audience did for a few weeks back in 98.  We even went so far as to purchase bulk bags of LifeSaver lollipops and threw handfuls backwards over our shoulders whenever the airdrop footage came on.  So, I don't know anything about the second film, but the first one alone is enough to  get me to purchase the disc.  You won't be disappointed if you like screwball comedy.",1050105600,6,2110,4.3274111675126905
