8277419,4,B0007M8N3M,bought this - thought I'd learn it but never tried I'm too lazy for certain scams...but I'm sure it's good info..,1359936000,,113,4.428571428571429
8277420,1,B0007M8N3M,"Video totally useless I asked for my money back they told me I bought it, its mine.  I've read many books on blackjack
which had more information than this video.",1321056000,,162,4.4
8277421,5,B0007M8N3M,"The DVD does kick ass  - definitely recommend. Unlike other products of this kind that teach you something  most of us already know or that gives us very limited information, this DVD is very informative, filled with great advice based on real-life experience. This DVD doesn't try to fool you by tons of effects and mysterious lighting like some of other DVDs I've seen. It's very straightforward, very easy to follow, very clear, and, what I find very important - you do LEARN a lot from it.",1143590400,7,493,4.655172413793103
8277422,1,B0007M8N3M,"Audio wasn't clear.  Sound cut in and out.  You would think that they would at least retake the section where the speaker belches his lunch.  Poorly produced.  I got more out of the history channel special.  I feel my money was wasted on this product.  I think I would have been better off buying a $6 paperback book on blackjack.  Video was extremely short.

You can tell that he knows what he is talking about, but he doesn't communicate the information",1138492800,3,455,4.530864197530864
8277423,5,B0007M8N3M,"I have to give this DVD 2 thumbs up. This totally took me by surprise.  I figured that those MIT guys would be talking over my head and spitting out math formulas left and right.  That could not be further from the truth. This DVD took me step by step into the world of card counting.  Semyon lays out his card counting theories & techniques in a format that the ""average person"" can understand.  The DVD not only teaches you the basics of card counting, but also touches upon getting to the ""Long Term""/""Making $$$"".  The DVD captivated me for the full 50 minutes of instruction.  It was so well put together that I had to go to [...] to purchase his second DVD (Advanced Techniques).  Now in the second one he once again walks you through the more advanced techniques used by his now infamous Amphibian Team (aka. MIT Blackjack Team).  Here he covers Ace Sequencing, Cut-card games, and Shuffle Tracking.  It's like having your own MIT Blackjack tutor in the privacy of your own home.  If you can't attend his Blackjack Science Seminars this is a GREAT alternative.  Suit/Spade",1106524800,15,1079,4.596858638743456
