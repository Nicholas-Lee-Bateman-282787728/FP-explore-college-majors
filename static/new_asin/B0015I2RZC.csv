3144901,5,B0015I2RZC,Great series that keeps you up way past your bedtime. Ken Stott is a wonderful actor. The only downfall was that one of the DVD's was so badly damaged I didn't get to see the whole series.,1352764800,,188,4.108108108108108
3144902,5,B0015I2RZC,"Somehow I -- and a lot of others -- missed this excellent crimes series coming out of the UK.  When I bought the DVD series I thought it must be a new show, only to later discover that is is few years old.  The characters are very intriguing and fallible.  The storylines are dramatic and as per the norm with BBC programs, not afraid to kill off a favorite character or two.",1258156800,6,375,4.180555555555555

I've been addicted to VICE ever since they first started!
Now they are a big shot HBO show but they have preserved their originality and their authenticity.
If you're not familiar with the concept - they sent out their reporters onsite. The reporters mingle with the protagonist of the reportage - that could be ISIS soldiers, drug dealers, illegal immigrants trying to cross the border. The result is an exceptional firsthand account of this totally different world that otherwise you would have never caught a glimpse of.
The standard media normally reports the facts and drowns you in analysis and opinions.
VICE not only gives you a front roll seat but makes you part of the action.",1486598400,,749,4.8062015503875966
