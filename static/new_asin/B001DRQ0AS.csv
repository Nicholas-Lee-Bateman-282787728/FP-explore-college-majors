I loved making this movie and being apart of a dream that so many people share! I am so very proud of this project...I love the story, characters, music, cinematography, editing, and everything in between.

8480919,5,B001DRQ0AS,this is one of the most delightfully twisted films that has come along in a while. a perfect blend of comedy and the macabre blended together in one work of absolute genius.  i recommend this film to anyone who enjoys well made independent cinema.,1222300800,,247,4.613636363636363
