8220175,4,B000VUZSB0,"Film quality (VHS converted to digital) was less than avaerage, but film itself is a true classic. Excellent entertainment for the whole family just as it was described in teaser.",1397520000,,179,5.0
8220176,3,B000VUZSB0,"It's a classic with lots of great footage.  It's SOOOO 70's!  It's like taking a time machine back to 1970.  The mid-grade rating is for the horribly cheap packaging and the so-so quality of the transfer.  If you want to own this, I'd hold off until a blu-ray is released.",1363132800,,272,4.38
