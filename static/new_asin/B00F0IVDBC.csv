8611095,5,B00F0IVDBC,"second disc is behind the scenes footage and very eye opening. i already own the awe print of this film, i knew there was something different concerning this release. metal pak editions(just like steelbooks) are great, difficult to damage and easy to wipe clean if dirtied. another great cinematic triumph from the director of the burning moon(the vhs which shocked american gore hound fanbase to it's very core back in 1997.",1404864000,,425,5.0
8611096,4,B00F0IVDBC,Either you like this movie or you don`t. I happen to enjoy these actors that Olaf uses in this movie and in Legion of the Dead. They are unfamiliar to the majority but they all work well together. I am more impressed by movies with low budgets that seem to produce a decent quality product. Thats just me. Haven`t been to the theatre since Blade opened in the 90`s. This movie is very well paced. No dull moments. The special effects are great but people expecting Premutos style will be disappointed. Premutos was like Peter Jacksons BrainDead. Who can jam the most gore into one movie and make it work. The storyline in this movie is unique in its own way and not the usual borrowed stuff like movies do today. Its like 3 stories tied into one. I still have yet to see a good re-make. The 2 dvd set has tons of extras and the dvd`s play on U.S. dvd players which is a plus. If your a Olaf fan then you gotta have this in the collection.,1398384000,,938,4.216666666666667
