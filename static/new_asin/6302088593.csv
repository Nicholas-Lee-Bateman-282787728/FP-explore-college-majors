419958,5,6302088593,"What a classic, who doesn't feel like Lucas sometimes. I watched this film so many times, its crazy. It still entertains me though. Great Cast : Charlie Sheen, Corey Haim, & Winona Ryder. And a great,sad, funny and uplifting story.",1073088000,2,231,4.8
419959,5,6302088593,"I can relate very well to this film. I saw it my senior year of high school in 1991, but I didn't notice how true it rang for me until today. Like Lucas, I was unpopular but outgoing. Many students looked down on me because I was in special education and was considered 'stupid'. I also had a crush on a cheerleader and did everything to get her attention. And also like Lucas, my heart was crushed when she decided to date a football player. I was even told by one of the teachers to stick with my own kind (he didn't say those EXACT words, but it sounded that way) when he talked to her about me. The good news was the pain I felt healed in time.
That is why I like Lucas. It is a movie I can relate to, and is full of honesty. Unlike a few other 80s teen films, it doesn't stereotype it's characters. Lucas is not a stereotypical geek because he is interesting, Cappy is not your stereotypical jock because he has a good heart and looks out for Lucas, and Maggie is not your stereotypical high school cheerleader because she doesn't act snotty. Looking back on this film now would be a trip through innocence because many of the main stars have had their share of trouble in recent years. Still, if you want to watch a great film that takes an honest look at teen angst, 'Lucas' hits the right buttons.",1046304000,52,1305,4.224
419960,5,6302088593,"The year I was born had many great movies including Top Gun, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Stand By Me, and of course Lucas.  This was one of the more touching movies I've ever seen and it made you just want to be poor Lucas'(Corey Haim) friend.  I really didn't see any flaws in it.  Kerri Green and Charlie Sheen also had really good performances.  I will not forget this movie soon because it's really touching.  It's a film that says don't change who you are because you're wonderful and someday people will love you for that and it's okay to be different.  I'd recommend it to anybody who has been the the oddball and just needed to be accepted somewhere. This film should have gotten more praise in the 80's because it really deserves it.  See it-you won't regret it--I know I sure didn't.",1041811200,2,791,4.451388888888889
419961,5,6302088593,"Let me tell you, Lucas is one of the best teen movies ever!  In an age when people think teens have no feelings, and are sex, and party crazy, it is refreshing to see a film like this.  A true gem sbout the joys and pains of growing up.  Excellent performances.  It is too bad Corey Haim made bad movie choices afterward, because I believe he has talent.  Anyway, he wil always have this one.  Charlie Sheen, and Kerri Green are also marvelous.  Do yourself a favor, and check it out.",1020124800,6,484,4.252747252747253
419962,4,6302088593,"""Lucas"" is a good example of how 80's adolescent movies undermines 90's teen movies. I don't have to tell the ones who read this that the teen movies that are made today is beyond horrible. One thing I love about the eighties, is that the directors who made teenage movies really put their hearts in it, and made an effort to capture the true luminous light of youth. I was immediately taken with ""Lucas"", because, unlike most teen movies, intelligence and individuality were portrayed. Clever dialogue, wonderful acting, and best of all, individuality was emphasized. One thing I honestly regret about being a seventeen-year-old teenager in the millennium is having to be subjected to Hollywood teen flicks, which are so full of dreck it's amazing. My skin almost crawls when I look at ""She's All That,"" ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", ""Loser"", ""Drive Me Crazy"", etc. Plus, the actors in ""Lucas"" do more of a convincing job than the modern teen actresses today. Watch ""Lucas"". You'll be rewarded. It's simple in its sweetness and charm, and is always good for a snowy night.",1005004800,6,1074,4.842391304347826
419963,5,6302088593,"I saw this movie 7 years ago and I thought it was a very
 special film,not only because of the script but because of the incredible acting talent on display.
I have to say that those glasses do not flatter Corey Haims features but they were an important part of making the character Lucas more believable as a nerdy,yet highly inteligent young boy.
Charlie Sheen and Winona Ryder are great as Lucas`s protectors against the school bully.

The magic between Haim And Ryder on screen has to be scene to be believed and as I have said before in respect of Corey Haim its a shame that he could not have continued the same standard of acting in his more recent appearances.
Great film buy it or lose something very special forever",999993600,2,725,4.484848484848484
419964,4,6302088593,"Lucas is a good movie. It has comedy, drama and romance all in one film. You get to see all the famous actors like Corey haim,kerri green,charlie sheen and wynoda ryder when they were just teenagers. This is a must see movie,even though it came out in the mid-80's it's still a good one. Lucas is for the whole family to enjoy.",996537600,4,327,4.290322580645161
419965,5,6302088593,"As I read the premise began to watch the movie, I thought ""this is probaqbly going to be another teen movie about falling in love, probably another ""She's All That"" or ""Drive Me Crazy."" But I was definitely wrong!! This movie has heart, it brings you back to that time in high school when you loved that one popular boy or girl and he or she was in love with the jock, or the prep, or the cheerleader and you were just the quiet, band geek as Lucas was. The characters are so well developed and intelligent the actors are so in tuned to their parts it is as if they aren't acting at all.  And at the end of the movie, I found myself sobbing until my eyes were almost red!!",972777600,3,672,4.090909090909091
419976,4,6302088593,"I have watched this movie I don't know how many times.  I have watched by myself and with different friends.  And everybody always likes it.  Corey Haim plays a 14 year old who is advanced enough to be in High School.  Just before school starts he meets a new girl who is 16.  They hangout and when school starts she gets interested in one of the star football players.  And that leaves Corey Haim as Lucas kind of out in the cold.
He didn't fit in anyway,  He was constanty picked on.  So the story goes on.  And Lucas who must have weighed about 95 pounds goes out for the football team.  Then the Principal tells him it is too dangerous for him.  Then sneaks in anyway during the first game.  One major fault with the movie was during the game he didn't catch the pass and the play should have been over with when he got hurt.
This is a good movie with great performances from Charlie Sheen, Kerri Green, and especially Corey Haim who I think could have even won an Oscar for this.  Kerri Green who I think I only saw three movies with her.  This, The Goonies  and another movie she made with Charlie Sheen called Three For The Road where she eats with a fork between he toes was always good.  And whatever happened to her.  Corey Haim who was so good in this turned out to be one of those stars who fame was fleeting.  Turned into another tragic Hollywood story.  But you can watch this and see what might have been.",1504569600,,1420,4.231343283582089

420016,5,6302088593,"This is such a Powerful Movie!!!:) When I first watched this movie on cable on my On Demand it had a lot of heart and a lot of funny stuff and heartbroken stuff. It's about a 14 year old boy who Loves a Girl who's just 2 years older then him but likes somebody else. I've been there myself from Elem. School and High-School! After the 14 year old boy meets this girl playing tennis The Girl just wants to be friends which Hurts a lot because he loves what he sees in her and she thinks otherwise about him! I'm still going through that myself as an adult looking for love and Tired of getting hurt from women who has it reversed, HOT on the outside and RUDE on the inside!!! I'm hoping that will change for me!!! Anyway the 14 year old boy tries to convince the girl that he can do normal things and gets hurt very badly and almost dies. It has a Powerful Ending but still hurts the 14 year old who wishes that girl was his!!! Kerri Green who Played "" That Girl"" is HOT and SEXY in this Movie!!!:)",1470960000,,997,4.091836734693878

420224,4,6302088593,"This 1980's movie helped to make Charlie sheen a big star. Unlike today where we don't have many actors who become big early on , back then it happened more often. You just knew Sheen was going to the top. And Cory Haim was bound for a great career too it seemed , this movie which did quite well made them even more popular. This movie about a young 14 year old who will do anything to impress a older girl was right on the mark.  This blu ray which looks pretty good is worth owning and very family friendly. It's a good story of teen angst and it has both touching and comedic moments.  Even today a kid could emphasize and relate to the basic story here.  The characters are played as real people and not stereotypes. It's worth owning on blu ray if you love these type of movies. Watching this close to 30 years later it's easy to see how much charisma these actors had and sadly both of them would let drugs destroy their careers (sheen could have stayed a giant movie star but by the mid 90's that prospect was gone) and they even completely destroyed Haim's health. He died a few years back , broke and barely functioning.  Thankfully this movie isn't about drugs. Because even back then , a drug movie was about teens out of it, and this is a story with a better message. And it has a good blu ray release finally.",1372291200,2,1323,4.238095238095238

420262,5,6302088593,"Lucas (Corey Haim) is a spirited runt who likes bugs and classical music, and when he sees a new girl, Maggie (Kerri Green), playing tennis on an abandoned court, he likes her too, and expresses this by casually playing Waltz of the Flowers on a tape deck he carries in his backpack.
They become summer friends, trekking through swamp and sewer where they talk about Keeping an Open Mind and the more Superficial aspects of high school.
When the term begins several things set the mood. Lucas' friends, Ben (Ciro Poppiti), bold, brave, basketball-shaped, and Rina (Winona Ryder), quiet, boyish, and harboring a crush towards Lucas that he never notices, announce to him that their band teacher shot himself because of a broken heart which prompts several later conversations glossing over Romeo and Juliet. Less than ten minutes afterwards during a beginning of the year pep-rally-type assembly Lucas is publicly humiliated by Bruno (Tom Hodges) the Bad Football player, an insecure and abrasive second in command, though later that night at the movie theatre he is commended for being a ""good sport"" by Cappie (Charlie Sheen) the Good Football player, and his girlfriend Alise (Courtney Thorne-Smith). After being invited out after the movie by Cappie, Lucas also survives sitting in the back of Cappie's car with Spike (Jeremy Piven) and Tonto (Kevin Wixted) imp-faced Football Players who are defined by their names, rough, but too bumbling to be malicious.
To Lucas' disappointment, Maggie goes out for cheerleading, and to Alise's disgust, Cappie begins spending a lot of time staring at Maggie. Cappie and Maggie become a tentative couple, and Lucas, in a desperate attempt to attract her attention, tries out for the football team - which goes about as well as you think it would for a 90lb kid appearing to be constructed of toothpicks.

It's good. It's realistic. Some kids are cruel, selfish, and vulgar, but they are also sweet, vulnerable, and intelligent. High school football games are not won by miracles that occur seconds before the clock runs out, football players and cheerleaders aren't all evil Barbie and Ken dolls, and not all band and science club members are pure pictures of socially awkward innocence. All the actors, incredibly young as they were, play their parts well so the characters seem warm and three-dimensional, and appear to be people, rather than props.
Five stars for one of the few movies that does not treat high school like a bad nightclub.",1358726400,,2483,5.026699029126213
420263,5,6302088593,I bought this movie for my 12 year old grandson.  This was his first year playing football and I really wanted him to see it.,1355184000,,125,4.0
420264,5,6302088593,"I didn't grow up with this movie, so I came to it fresh when I watched it for the first time last night. I am, however, a fan of both coming-of-age films and Corey Haim, so I was kind of hard-wired to like it.

Even so, the movie was better than I expected. It seems to me that the movie description and, especially, the DVD cover are slightly misleading. Parts of the film do center around football, but it's certainly not a ""football movie."" That cover, with the ridiculous photoshopped football, was incredibly off-putting to me and probably the reason why I hadn't watched this sooner.

What this movie actually is, is a smart, incredibly sweet coming-of-age story. It's a ""small"" movie, but I don't mean that as a negative. The scope is narrowed and it has a real small town, slice of life feel to it. It's an indie in the truest sense of the word, but it's one that stands the test of time. The writing is smarter than it needs to be, and it's got one of the best teen casts of the 80's. Corey Haim steals the show as the title character. Cute, funny, tragic... it's a complicated role. It's also definitely his best movie. Kerri Green is equally as good as the object of his affection, and it's fun to see Charlie Sheen and Winona Ryder ""back in the day.""

If you're a fan of 80's movies, teen movies or just good old fashioned story-telling, give this overlooked gem a chance!",1335571200,,1384,4.3984375
420265,4,6302088593,"How do you fit into the social scene of high school when you are a precocious, bespeckled, 14 year old brainy, scrawny kid who is more interested in the lifespan of locusts than romance?  That is, until Lucas meets Maggie, a red-headed beauty who capivates his heart and soul. They become fast friends because they find each other interesting.  But Maggie is 16, light-years ahead in maturity, and she turns heads in her direction, especially a particularly handsome wide receiver (Sheen).  So there is only one thing for Lucas to do in order to ""keep"" Maggie's interest - join the foot ball team and become a football hero!  Outmatched and outweighed, Lucas struggles to find acceptance among his teammates, his coach, and the entire student body.  The three central characters, Sheen, Maggie, and Lucas, form the core of this coming of age movie that is fun, innocent, and engaging. ""What are we going to do about you, Lucas?"", says Maggie, and this forms the central theme of the film.

Can a nerdy, wimpy, prepubescent bug nut find his rightful place in a world that is dominated by jocks, cheerleaders, and a social network that he has no place in?  It is well worth the 95 minutes to find out.  Teens will love this movie, and so will older folks as well, for there is a part of Lucas in all of us that we can relate to.  Not appropriate for those under 13 years of age due to language and sexually suggestive dialogue.

420266,5,6302088593,"While Lucas is a touching story of a boy who wants to impress a girl by changing his image regardless of the fact that nature dictates otherwise, this movie is worth seeing just to stare at Charlie Sheen who is in his teens at the time of this film.  Why is he so beautiful?  N-E way, he is really cool in this movie which only adds to his complete and total hotness.  What I like about this movie is how confident Lucas is. He is a nerd but can he really be described as a nerd? He likes bugs and he is really smart, but he is very confident, not at all a victim, even though his life is a sad and tragic story with a absent mother and alcoholic father that is not seen but only talked about during the film. He lives in a ratty old trailer park and works for a gardner. He is bullied on a regular basis but endlessly fights back against the bullies. In a constant battle to demand his right to exist he finally earns the respect of his peers in a very moving and powerful end.",1306800000,,978,4.030927835051546

I realize that this is supposed to be my review and not Roger Ebert's, but I can't help but quote a couple of things he said.  About Haim's performance in ""Lucas"": ""He creates one of the most three-dimensional, complicated, interesting characters of any age in any recent movie. If he can continue to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor. He is that good.""

Ebert listed it as one of the top 10 films of 1986.  I agree with that assessment.  It's a quiet, well-written, beautifully acted movie.

420287,5,6302088593,"Long before he was forced by obscurity and/or poverty to try selling his teeth on the Internet for cash, Corey Haim had a brief heydey in mid-1980's films.
 (SEE HAIM ALSO IN  ""SILVER BULLET"" AND ""THE LOST BOYS."")
  This charming film from writer/director David Seltzer is the best. I was delighted to find this on DVD at  Amazon,com,  and equally delighted to find, after all these years, that the movie retains all of its charm.

  Haim plays Lucas, a scrawny geek who doesn't fit in anywhere. He covers his pain by being goofy and outspoken. We know little of his home life. We hear his dad is ""alcoholic"" and nobody knows where his mother is.
Lucas is smart and sensitive. Lucas loves insects and classical music. He soon falls in love with  Maggie (Kerri Green) the new girl in town. The two begin a touching friendship, but things change a bit once school starts. Maggie cares for Lucas, but falls for sensitive/sexy football player Cap (Charlie Sheen). Meanwhile, Lucas never notices that Rena (Winona Ryder in her film debut) has a crush on him. Instead, he joins the football team in order to prove his ""prowess"" and attractiveness to females. Lucas nearly gets himself killed, but he gains the respect of the entire school.
  There is one unfortunate moment in a football team locker room/shower scene where a negative term for ""gay"" (The Other ""F"" word) is used. That is unnecessary, but brief.  This is almost compensated for by the fact that, even here at age 22. Charlie Sheen is smolderingly sexy. Sheen appears in a lengthy scene  without a shirt on, and I say ""Thank You, God!"" for that. Gratuitous,  yes,  but I'm extremely grateful.
  You could watch this movie and play a game of ""Whatever Became Of..."" ?  as several members of the young cast, including Jeremy Piven, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Ryder, and Charlie Sheen  went on to notable careers. I think Sheen and Green appeared together in another film at the same time period titled ""THREE FOR THE ROAD"". If anybody knows where I can pick that one up, please let me know; and, does anybody know whatever happened to Kerri Green? I'd like to know. And, say what you will about his messy private life or controversial political views, Sheen is a survivor who has worked for a stable, solid career. Whatever individual fates may have befallen the cast, and the sad fact that Haim has virtually vanished off the world radar, ""LUCAS"" holds up remarkably well;  well enough, in fact, to achieve a poignant timelessness and be acknowledged as one of the ""CLASSIC"" teen films of the 1980's era.

420289,5,6302088593,"The eighties were Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" when it comes to teen movies.  For a few years you had a string of movies featuring realistic dialog and an accurate depiction of teenage angst caused by the belief that everything matters just a bit too much.  Sure, the plots could be clichd, but the characters and dialog were believable and nothing was too far-fetched or predictable.  Of course, all good things come to an end and now the term ""teen movie"" refers to a comedy filled with one-dimensional characters, nudity, and shock humor.  There's nothing wrong with an over-the-top comedy, but it's a shame that they've more or less wiped out the old teen dramas and coming-of-age stories.

  When it comes to the eighties movies it seems like the Brat Pack/John Hughes films get the most attention, but the best movie of them all was David Seltzer's ""Lucas.""

  Here's the basic plot:  Maggie moves to town during the summer and gets noticed by a local nerd, Lucas.  A friendship forms between them, even though he's younger, and he develops a crush on her, but things change when school starts.  It's not that she doesn't want to be his friend--but she also meets new people, and Lucas is so busy trying to be a part of Maggie's world that he doesn't even notice the advances of another girl (a young Winona Ryder).

  ""Lucas"" is melodramatic at times, but that just makes it more realistic.  Teenagers DO tend to make everything into a life-or-death situation and they make crazy choices to get what they want.  All of the characters in this movie defy stereotypes.  Lucas isn't just nerd who can be written off--he's a sympathetic character.  But so is Maggie...and the jock football player played by Charlie Sheen.  Everyone makes tough choices due to their hormones.  It's easy to think the movie is silly at time--it's been spoofed a hundred times I think--but it's also a movie worth seeing.  It was pretty much the best thing Cory Haim or Kerri Green ever starred in.",1175299200,5,1976,4.747058823529412

I feel I can identify with Lucas because I too was a bit of a nerd in high school.  I had my share of troubles with jocks and was disapointed when girls I had a crush on only liked me as a friend or liked someone else.  But Lucas mananaged to gain the one thing by the end of the film that we all yearn for: RESPECT.,1131580800,3,493,3.88
420315,4,6302088593,"Everyone relates to Lucas on some level.  He was an awkward kid with quirky interests and an ernest manner about him.  I realize now looking at him in contrast to the other popular kids exactly what makes a person ""well liked"" in certain situations.  Honesty and sincerity seem to not make someone popular, and if you have other interests besides being the star of the team then you're odd, and your worth is measured by something else entirely.

Corey Haim, in perhaps his most famous and successful role, plays the dorky kid Lucas.  He befriends a pretty new girl in town and they become very close over the summer.  Once school starts, she begins to branch out and meet new people, including the star quarterback Charlie Sheen.  Lucas becomes naturally jealous that the gal he had developed a crush on is becoming smitten with someone else and not acknowledging his more gentile charms, and even attempts to join the football team in hopes of getting her approval.  Beaten up by the steroid ridden jocks and crushed on the field, he never gives up on his dream of someday winning her over.

It's a noble thought, but now this leaves a lot of things up to questioning people's character.  When Charlie Sheen's girlfriend dumps him, he comes to Lucas's fair lady for comfort.  When Lucas shows up to take her to the school dance, she announces that she will not be going with him but taking Charlie Sheen out for pizza.  If she truly had integrity she would've forgone her love for Charlie Sheen for that one night and stuck to her obligation.  Charlie Sheen was supposed to be the reformed jock who saw what a great person Lucas really was, and he does defend him when others try to bully, but if he was really a friend he would've stepped aside and said to the dream girl that while he cares for her he doesn't want to hurt Lucas's feelings so they should put it aside.  As for Lucas, he told the dream girl that he lived on a house on the hill when he actually lives in a trailer park.  He wanted her to like him for who he was not the fact that he was a kid from a trailer park, but the bottem line was that he lied as well.  Maybe none of them had all that much integrity to begin with, but it is, after all, high school.",1128556800,4,2227,4.368932038834951

Lucas (Corey Haim), the school wimp, a 14-year-old in high school on an accelerated course because of his brainieness, and therefore smaller than his classmates, falls for Maggie (Kerrie Green), a new girl in the school.  They are friends, but when it comes to the romance department, to his great disappointment she falls for Cappie (Charlie Sheen), who is a jock.

Lucas becomes convinced that the only way to win his love was through the football hero route, and in spite of his diminutive size, he te tries out for the team without the coach's approval, who immediately throws him off the field.

Watch the movie for the rest of the story.  It was a great story of young teenagers emotions, and unrequited love.  If you are as impressed as I, you will enjoy this film a lot.

420317,5,6302088593,"""Lucas"" is a film about growing up.  We all can relate to the problems associated with adolescence and puberty, especially the part about wishing we were someone else.  This film is about heroes and the unlikely places you will find them.  Underdogs can win in the game of life.  An excellent movie for young and old alike!",1089072000,3,323,4.614035087719298

420319,5,6302088593,"Well, maybe I guess it is an 80's teen movie, but unlike other 80's teen movies this film is intelligent and has a heart.
The other movies from this genre are plot driven. Honestly, how many different titles has the story of ""Can't Buy me Love"" had? This movie however has taken a different perspective to look at teenage years and took the approach to drive the story from the characters, not plot.
The movie is brave by not taking the easy way out (except for one scene which I won't ruin) and I respect that. It also makes the movie less predictable and more entertaining to watch for us the audience.
I think this movie is the best movie of the teen movie genre. I loved Ferris Beuller, Sixteen Candles, and the other John Hughes greats. Those films were also loads more humerous too, but Lucas aims to do more than achieve laughs and I applaude its efforts.",1074556800,20,862,4.427672955974843

7820575,5,6302088593,"The first time I ever saw this movie back in the late 80's I connected with it right away because that was me, I was Lucas. Well I wasn't as smart as he was but other than that, I was a small runt sized kid who was envious of the jocks because yeah those guys always got the really cute girls. I'm pretty sure for most folks that is your High School life, your either a jock, geek, goth what have you. So then this Lucas is another coming of age story about a young kid, Lucas played by Corey Haim, who on the summer of his 14rth year he meets Maggie (Kerri Green) a girl 3 years older than him & new to the area. Lucas quickly develops a crush on her & hey become fast friends & spend a lot of time together up to the start of the school year. Once the school year starts Maggie then meets Cappie played by Charlie Sheen, one of the jocks on the Varsity football team, there's an instant attraction which sparks jealousy by Cappies current girlfriend Alise (Courtney Thorne-Smith) & our main character Lucas. The remainder of the movie is about Lucas's attempts to win Maggie's heart which in the end nearly gets him killed. In my honest opinion in what I would call a silent tradegy of the movie, Lucas's friend Rina played by Winona Ryder has the same feelings for Lucas that he has for Maggie but for whatever reason he never realizes it and for that reason the movie although on screen has a happy ending to me still ends sadly because I could also relate to her.",1512950400,,1468,4.227758007117438
7820576,2,6302088593,"I just saw this again recently as an adult (I was a teen in the 80s when this came out). Although I did really like the characters played by Kerri Green, Charlie Sheen, Winona Rider and some of the minor characters I thought it was kind of a mixed bag. The character of Lucas has some good  points (smart, helpful to some characters) and bad points (arrogant and a liar).

SPOILER: The worst part was the horrible football player who constantly harasses Lucas and at one point Lucas is basically sexually assaulted in the locker room (bullies on the football team put something on his private parts) which is played as ""hilarious"" to the entire school in the movie.

The end of the movie is supposed to make up for everything, but the movie just left me feeling angry at the jerks in the world and the people encouraging the bad behavior. I also was left wondering if the one jock will go to prison when he grows up if his horrible behavior continues.

Not a movie I would want to watch again and I don't think it's a great ""family"" movie. It just left me with a bad feeling.",1512345600,,1075,4.36
