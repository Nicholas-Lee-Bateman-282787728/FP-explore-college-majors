8503087,5,B006QQ2CC6,"This thing is a masterpiece. its a fairy tale that is absolutely horrible and I loved it.

If you have watched any Korean historical drama's you can tell that this takes place in an earlier more primitive era and I enjoyed seeing this time when mythical and modern ages overlap.

The two little girls steal the show, they are both a couple of the best actresses I've ever seen.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.",1385596800,,426,4.3
8503088,4,B006QQ2CC6,"The Editorial Review for this series is rather a bit off base... as is the translated title. The original title is : . With  meaning Gumiho which means Nine-Tail Fox and  being loosely translated as tale of the fox child or fox sister. While ""grudge"" is an integral part of the story, it doesn't appear in the original title. As for the synopsis, a more accurate version would be the Gumiho mother and daughter are taken in when a wealthy man needs a child's liver to save his daughter's life. The story is a Shakespearean style tragedy from beginning to end. While the makeup and effects leave a bit to be desired, it remains an engrossing tale and worth a watch for fans of Eastern lore. There is a good deal of bloodshed, so parents should be aware it wasn't written for very young audiences.",1355875200,,795,4.475862068965517
