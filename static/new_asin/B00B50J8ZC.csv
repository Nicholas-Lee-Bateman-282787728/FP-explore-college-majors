5555958,4,B00B50J8ZC,"Firstly the only reason for four stars was personal preference of the genere and difficulty of loading  on ""Seven"" with my player.

Eventually it worked fine, but took a few disc wipes to get it to do so.

I enjoy Morgan Freeman, suspense not so much, so it was a mixed bag purchase.

Every movie was excellent. Seven was very realistic, the ending sadly inevitable.

Devil's Advocate is a movie that had a lot of box office success, the price point would have made the collection worthwile just for this one.

Insomnia and Heat are both enjoyable and overall I'd have to rate the movies as follows [without giving much away].

Acting - ****
Scripts - ****
Sets - *****
Special effects - *****
Overal entertainment value - ****
Value for money - *****

A nicely packaged, if double sided set, that is worth watching more than once. Each movie [removing the vehicle years] continues to age very well.",1324425600,,899,4.610062893081761
5555959,5,B00B50J8ZC,"What a deal this is!  It's four movies on 2 double sided discs.  Also if you are wondering, it uses all of the original DVD transfers from the 1st editions of each movie.  So don't expect massive bonus features or high bit rate transfers.  The good thing is that all the transfers are enhanced for Widescreen televisions, and all look good, especially Insomnia which is the newest movie of the 4",1320451200,,395,4.52112676056338
5555960,4,B00B50J8ZC,"I love these movies, and once again have them all on VHS and was psyched to see them all in a 4-film dvd package (and the price was a great deal!), but, come on-- all 4 disks stuffed in one slot??  I recently reviewed another 4-Film collection (Love Stories) that was packaged the same way. All of the other multi-film boxes I have purchased have multi-film slots, or are 2 or more of the movies on each disk, or double-sided.  I totally appreciate the better quality of the individual movie disks--- that is, until they become unwatchable due to the scratches from being stacked on top of each other, not to mention the difficulty in getting them out of the box. Once again, when I opened the box and saw only 1 movie disc----I almost thought that there was an error and was only sent 1 of the movies. But having just received another 4 film set I took the movie out and sure enough, there were all 4 movies in the same slot.  Luckily I have extra boxes so could separate them and use the artwork from the vhs boxes. I guess maybe I'm being too picky-- after all it was a great deal, fast shipping, etc. etc. and packaging this way helps keep the cost down, But I almost wish that they came in separate disk envelopes-- even without the case or artwork so that I would know that these movies will need to be stored a better way. But since the price was pretty cheap for 4 movies I guess I shouldn't complain...!!",1315008000,12,1413,4.304511278195489
5555961,5,B00B50J8ZC,"Yes, it's hard to read which movie is which on the DVD labels. Tiny print in the circles. However, in bright light, it's not a problem. The quality is perfect. Enjoyed the savings for 4 movies.",1312416000,9,193,4.388888888888889
5555962,4,B00B50J8ZC,"These are old collections of the suspense movies and you have to like this type of films to have this DVD.  I like the Insomnia and Seven more than the Heat and The Devil's Advocate due to the story line and the plot.  Al Pacino's performance (in three of the four movies of this set)becomes more predictable in his style.  So he is not like Meryl Streep who can act on any roles.  If you like to collect any one of the four movies, then you can not beat the price of this combo collection.",1311638400,,490,4.126315789473685
5555963,5,B00B50J8ZC,"This is a terrific deal!  We haven't watched Devil's Advocate yet, but really like the other movies and what a deal for four movies!",1311292800,,132,4.5
5555964,5,B00B50J8ZC,"Update:  Not sure why my review has been moved to the movie Insomnia, but the review I wrote below is for a Quad Pack DVD package that includes Insomnia, Heat, The Devil's Advocate, and Seven. Unless you are considering a purchase of the Quad package, the review below will not be much help because it deals with the transfer quality of the movies, not the movies themselves.

Okay, you probably know the movies, so no need to review them.  Chances are you have interest in one or more of the movies but aren't quite sure whether to pull the trigger due to the Quad Pack packaging.  I wanted The Devil's Advocate plus Heat and it was less expensive to get them packaged like this than separately.  I was just suspicious of what kind of quality transfer I'd get, but what the heck, I took the risk and ordered it.

As soon as I get a blu-ray or DVD movie I pop it my HD system to see the quality of the transfer.  Then I rate it from 1 to 5, 1 being perfect, 2 digital sharp, 3 marginal, 4 poor, and 5 unwatchable.  I'm always suspicious of Double-Triple-Quad movie packs because the quality of the transfer to DVD is generally a lower quality.  That isn't the case with this quad pack.  Granted, my rating scale is subjective but I have a discerning eye.  All four movies in this pack rated as a 2 for digital sharp.  One of the DVD movies, Seven, even came with the DTS sound option.  The other 3 were Dolby 5.1.

There are two double sided DVDs in the quad pack, a movie on each side.  The only criticism of the discs is you have to have a magnifying glass to read the center rim label to see which movie you're popping in the player.  Thankfully each movie is just as nice as a single disc, keepcase DVD.

Overall, this DVD quad pack is definitely worth the price.",1298505600,35,1767,4.274096385542169
5555965,4,B00B50J8ZC,Not all of these are great movies! But it was worth it just to have Se7en and Heat alone!,1286236800,,89,3.736842105263158

5555972,4,B00B50J8ZC,"From ""The Devil's Advocate"" I discovered something that I never realized:  Keanu Reeves can act!!!  I **** you not.  His acting made me forget ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Much Ado About nothing.""  ""Insomnia,"" like ""The Proposal,"" is sort of like ""product placement"" for Alaska, but it works, and it holds your interest.  ""Heat features veterans Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a bad guy with some good traits and a good guy with some bad traits.

5555979,5,B00B50J8ZC,"Good movies, and the five stars are based on that. If I could score the video quality separately it would be a 2 for 'Heat,""  which was noisy throughout and in some scenes, blurrred, (played on a Samsung BD-H5100 bluray player).  I got on Amazon and ordered the BluRay version of 'Heat' while listening to the Heat soundtrack, it was that bad.

The other three disks were fine.

Too bad the same set isn't available on BluRay.

The case only has one peg for all four DVDs, so you have to handle them all to get the one you want.",1417132800,,528,4.24

5555995,5,B00B50J8ZC,"At first, I received the packaging that had two, double-sided DVD's.  I had to return them because two of the movies got to a certain chapter in the movie and then stopped, no matter what DVD player or computer I tried to use.  Amazon was wonderfully simple to do a return, and I had my replacement in two days.  There must have been a manufacturing error with the first one, because the second shipment came as four single-sided DVD's and they all played perfectly.  I did not see these movies in the theater, and the heavily censored and edited TV versions are hopeless.  It was really great to see these movies as they were originally meant to be seen.  At this price, to get four quality movies is a real deal.",1330732800,11,714,4.412213740458015
