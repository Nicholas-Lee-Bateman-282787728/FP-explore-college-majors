I saw this film a couple of nights ago on Netflix and was totally mesmerized by it.  Totally mesmerized!  When I read the reviews for Amok on Netflix, such as, Its boringnothing happens til the end (the murders  obviously an American viewer)Id rather watch paint dry, and the like, I knew I would enjoy the film.  Most Americans cannot abide what I call naturalistic cinema, which usually consist of people / characters doing ordinary things throughout the course of the film.  The pacing of the film is almost glacially slow, not that I mind that.  I welcome it in fact.  I don't mind a movie that takes its time to tell its story.  The film tells the tale of an old German accountant, who slowly descends into a murderous breakdown.
The protagonist hardly speaks at all.  The actor, Tilo Nest, gives an incredible performance of a broken man on his way to the precipice.  He conveys volumes with his eyes, his body language, and when he does speak you can hear the agony rattling inside him.  I was riveted.  When he finally flies to pieces at the climax of the film the violence he unleashes is both guttural and yet at the same time almost perfunctory.
There are many quiet scenes in the film; the accountant sitting on a bench surrounded by people walking back and forth before him, yet he is totally alone in a sea of people.  He goes on a bender one night and laughs and cries with equal measure.  His boss gives him a promotion and at the same time insults him.  You can see the desperation in his eyes to be anywhere but near this man.  At one point, he talks to his mother over the phone in a restaurant, where hes had three large beers in a row, and his mother berates him for drinking again.  The look of anguish on his face is heartbreaking.
Its a pity there is no American Region version of the DVD.  Id buy it immediately!  Amok has to be the most quiet character study Ive ever seen.  Little is explained about the main character, but if you observe carefully he does in fact reveal quite a bit about himself, and his agony.  If you're a fan of quiet / slow building cinema, you will definitely enjoy this film.",1501027200,,2141,4.410714285714286
