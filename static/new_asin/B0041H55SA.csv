4242119,5,B0041H55SA,"This play is just as funny and as Madea Goes To Jail, Diary Of A Mad Black Woman and any other one. Tyler Perry sets the record straight for all the people that criticize him for playing as Madea. One thing I loved about the play is he teaches the simple aspect of love.",1290729600,2,270,4.018518518518518
4242120,4,B0041H55SA,"I just finished watching the play and even though I laughed through some of this, and Madea was doing only what she does best, the ending left me wanting so much more. I liked the beginning. made me feel we talking about the recession here, but we get drawn into a nice church lady(Chandra Currelley) who is only given a few weeks to live after trying her level best to beat cancer. With that in mind, she tries to gather her children together along with her doctor to let her know what's going on. You have one daughter Jackie(Cheryl Pepsi Riley) who is a plain jane Christian who does what she can for her mother; You also have another daughter with a mechanic husband, who stifles him so that he can't be the man he needs to be, then you have another successful daughter(Tamar Davis)who also stifles her husband, but is carrying around a secret that rocks the family; on the son's side, you have one son, already been in jail, with one baby momma, and one golddigger who wants her money by ""all means necessary"" even if he has go back to slinging; then another son, who is slow, but got heart. Add to the pot, a brother on crack who will steal anything not locked down, and you got a good play here. Also added to the pot, one wisecracking, crazy, bible toting, weed smoking aunt(Cassi Davis) and you got the makings of a good play. I liked it, but one couldn't keep on the subject of the momma dying because other things kept creeping up so all in all, the mother never mentioned her own problems worrying about others and when they could deal with anything, it was just too late. Madea offered comic relief and good advice, but if we could have had more dealing with the momma, and less on the rest, it could have been quite good.",1290470400,5,1735,4.374613003095975
4242121,5,B0041H55SA,"I have seen this Play live in Kansas City and I must agree. I laughed, cried, was angry, sad and happy. But thank god for the majority I was laughing. :)
It involved every emotion that we experience in life, and not to be dissapointed had quiet a few lessons in it.
As with every good comedy, you take someones hardship and make fun of it' a lot of people will laugh, because they can relate. The cast was the best he has had yet. Very talented all the way through and I had my favorites of course. ""Yaaaa Trick!!!"" lol
I have seen all of Tyler Perry's Plays, watched all of his movies. But with this one I wasn't even out of the Sprint Center and asked if they had the play on DVD. But was told I had to wait until november. :( sniff.
I have never ever in 40 years waited on any movie or play ...on anything for that matter for 6 month,
but for this I did.
Thank You Tyler for opening my eyes on a few things and making me laugh while you are sharing your experience and pain.
Buy it, trust me you will not regret it, it's worth every penny!

What I loved most was the soulful music that is sung, speaking of your faith, and the inspiring message that Tyler/Madea speaks at the end. I just love Madea and her many ways of getting her message across! I find it amazing that the cast in the play can keep from cracking up, even though I saw them smile like they were going to laugh. I also have seen several of his movies, but to me Madea holds the top spot! If you like music and roll on the floor laughter then you should get this play!

Plus, Tyler is hilarious in his ad-libs as he clearly works his rapport with the live audience for full effect. The scene involving the takeoffs on soul singers may seem out of joint to some viewers as it is not really related to the stopry at all, but works well with the live audience response. See this, then compare it with the movie version.",1312761600,,523,4.402061855670103

Those sort of undesirable people deserve entertainment too and for you small-minded people to think you're better than them is very telling. ANd you will definitely burn in Hades for criticizing Tyler Perry so thoughtlessfully.

Tyler Perry is a national treasure. He is the most bankable star in Hollywood and that upsets some of the sacred cows out in Hollywood who don;t like the fact that a man of color can beat them at their own game. Take that Tom Cruise! Take that Brad Pitts! Take that Alan Thicke!",1302825600,,775,4.5285714285714285
4242658,4,B0041H55SA,"I went to see the live play in Atlanta last year and thought the play was great.  The music was awesome and at times I felt like I was in a church service - sometimes the audience went crazy!

The only bad thing is some of the funnier ad lib stuff was edited out of the DVD, which is why it's better if you can see these plays in person.  For example, at the beginning of the play there were some people still walking in to their seats and Madea pretended to be mad, got out her gun, walked off the stage onto a little platform type thing, and said ""Here I am trying to do a play and here ya'll are comin in late!""  Then when she sat back down she saw a little kid in the front row and said, ""You didn't see that, little boy.  You ain't supposed to have a gun!""  Everybody cracked up.

The stage looked really cool in person because it looked like a two story doll house with an upper level that had the bedrooms, with the living room & kitchen downstairs.  I don't know if the DVD really captured that since the camera usually focused on one room at a time.

Also on the DVD player I was watching it on, the sound was kind of muted, especially the audience laughter and reactions.  Not sure if it was just the smaller portable player I was watching it on, maybe it would sound different on a nicer DVD player with a bigger TV.

I actually liked the monologue near the end, but maybe the version I saw was better than the one that got put on the DVD.  (I think they did 3 or 4 plays in Atlanta & filmed at least a couple of them if not all, so I'm sure parts were probably edited together from the different shows.)

Giving it 4 stars because watching the DVD didn't seem quite as fun, even though I really loved it when I saw it in person.",1302220800,,1740,4.037900874635569

The good thing is that is has spanish audio and not just subtitles. It does not sound the way i expected it to sound but it was still good.

I myself am a 50 year old African American woman and the other 3 where white. We left the play speechless it was so great this was the first time we had seen Tyler Perry in person and he did not let us down. This play is so powerful the music was fantastic and of course the people who were in it did a great job. This play was supposed to come to our home town but was one of the things that had to be canceled due to Mr. Perry not feeling well. I was so upset because we were all going to go see it again. It is a must see for everyone. I have grown to love the messages that he puts in all of his projects so I collect all of the plays as well as the movies.

4242700,4,B0041H55SA,"This was as someone else said a ""typical Tyler Perry,"" play.  Like all of his plays the overwhelming theme is forgiveness and letting go.  And just like in some of his earlier plays, you will experience samplings of some old school jams, even Tyler sings a few notes.

The play was good, but not as funny as some of his other plays.  The chemistry between Brown and Madea is what made the plays funny to me.  When I was watching it, I was expecting Brown or some form of him to come across the screen.  I just felt like something was missing.",1296432000,,542,4.264705882352941

I know if I paid more attention that I would have known he wasn't, but its like how can it be Madea's Big Happy Family without him & Cora? Especially, with Cora being Madea's daughter & Brown her ""baby daddy."" It's real refreshing still & Tyler does not disappoint. Madea keeps it real as always on major issues of today. You can't just really watch it once & stop. The singing is absolutely wonderful!!! So many beautiful voices!!! The young men really put it down!!!

The singing was both enlightening and outstanding. Tyler introduces many ""never-heard-of-them-before"" actors. The ""old school"" music towards to the end of the play was simply marvelous.

But that was all my patient ass could take. What's worse I spent 12.99 on the DVD which is now permanently in my collection as a constant reminder that I should have paid like what? No more than $4 to watch the shiz on Amazon Demand to see that it was complete shiz, at least then I could have saved myself $8.",1293840000,,646,3.8646616541353382

It makes you cry, laugh and sing some old school songs.

The two young man Tyler Perry found on YouTube have beautiful voices.  There is the wall flower who turns into the beauty.  Madea's antics and words of wisdom.

I couldn't stop laughing and to think this was done during a difficult time in his life with the recent passing of his mother; to whom which this dvd is dedicated.  The story in this stage play shows the importance of family values and how regardless of life's sometime stormy situations, you should always have family members to be supportive of each other no matter what.  I was unaware that Tyler had done another stage play DVD until I saw it on this website, which you will not be disappointed by purchasing one here with fast and prompt delivery as always.

4242805,5,B0041H55SA,"I thought the play was pretty darn good.  I had an opportunity to see Tyler and this play in Philadelphia.  Nothing compares to a live show because we all know Tyler will go off script which is more enjoyable because you never know what he might do.  The cast was splendid but a little too much singing for my taste however, the MESSAGES were delivered supreme.  For those of you who voted with 4 stars or less your entitled to your opinion but I believe in fairness and it's why I given 5 stars.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD/Play for all to see.",1292976000,,546,4.262135922330097
4242806,1,B0041H55SA,"Background: When I initially heard Tyler would be touring again with a live play I quickly made plans for my family and me to make the 2 hour drive to see him in L.A. Quickly, realtiy (the economy) set in and four tickets were going to be $400 or so, so I resigned to experiencing the play (again) on dvd. (I'm a HUGE fan of his plays (not the movies) yet I have never seen him perform live...)

So since last year, I've been waiting for the dvd to be released. The day Tyler sent the email that it was out was the day I flew onto Amazon to purchase it!

Two things:  I am SO GLAD we didn't see it live. In my humble opinion, it ranks at the bottom (along with Meet the Browns and that What's Done in the Dark (ugh)of his plays body of work.

I'm not surprized Tyler cut the tour early. He must have been WORN OUT by that incredibly long monologue at the end.  I'll be honest, in about 5 tries, I STILL have not been able to stay awake 'til the end. The actors are all sitting around behind him looking so uncomfortable for...it had to be 15 minutes straight of just Madea lecturing which is way too long for a play.  Like another reviewer said, I kept waiting for the ""good part"" and it never came. It never seemed to flow and it was just...that's enough from me already.

I'm glad Tyler is taking a break. He has exhibited glimpses of greatness (particularly with his humor), but I now believe the quantity (vs. quality) got the best of him. Rest, Tyler, and come back with greatness!

Peace!

P.S. I've only re-sold one other Tyler play, and this will be the 2nd. Sorry, but I won't want to watch it again.",1292976000,,1609,4.181229773462783
4242807,2,B0041H55SA,"Unfortunately, this was not up to par for Tyler Perry's stage plays.  The story line seems to have been thrown together.  None of the story lines of the characters seemed to come together.  Tyler Perry's longgggggg talk after the funeral seemed more like a sermon than a part of the play. It was just to long and then his exit was abrupt and out of place in the play.  I know that the stage play was cut short because Tyler was tired, and it was apparent that he was not at his best.  The singing was awesome in this play, but the rest of the play was a disappointment.  As in his other plays, there was not even a song at th end that bought everyone together.  It was just awful and sad.  If I had paid money to see this, I would have been highly upset.  My family, who are ages, 49, 44, 20 & 18 all feel the same way about this play.  I wish him better on the next play.  TYLER, PLEASE REST BEFORE YOU FILM AGAIN..",1292889600,6,916,4.033333333333333
4242808,5,B0041H55SA,"I laughed and laughed. It's worth it to see it at least twice. Buying the blu-ray of a stage play might seem like overkill but to me it is worth it for the extra visual quality. This blu-ray does not have any special behind the scenes footage, actor profiles, or anything fancy like that so if you are looking to get it for it's rich complementary material, forget it. It's just the play folks.",1292544000,,394,4.337837837837838
4242809,4,B0041H55SA,"This was my first Madea movie and I was delightfully surprised.  I was originally hoping to watch it with my ""8"" + ""10"" year olds, but they will be in their teens before they are ready to see it.  Some scenes were difficult and painful to watch, but what a good message!  I highly recommend it!  Madea puts her family first as well as others in need.  She has amazing insight as to what is going on with her family members and the advice they need, she delivers it in a way that you couldn't help but accept and put into action as you will see toward the victorious end!  It definitely has inappropriate comments and actions, but the good moral message wins out!  Go Madea!",1292371200,,673,4.2936507936507935
4242810,3,B0041H55SA,I am a fan of Madea's but this was way to long with way to many songs.  I love that Mr. Perry gives us our moneys worth and then some.  This one is on the bottom of the list for me,1292284800,,180,3.3658536585365852
4242811,5,B0041H55SA,"I flew to Columbus, GA to see this play with one of my best friends (more like a sister) and had a great time.  I wasn't too sure how I would feel about watching the DVD, after seeing it live, but I had that same great feeling and it was even funnier the second time around.  The songs are great; the acting is on point and the story line is notable.  I am a big fan of Tyler Perry but I was getting bored with his usual plays but something about this one brought me back around.  Highly recommended.  Oh and one noteable note: Lenny Williams would be proud!",1291680000,,558,4.08256880733945
4242812,5,B0041H55SA,"Mr. Tyler Perry has done it again. This was such an amazing storyline. I sent my mom to see this play for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. Now i know why it is such an inspiration to children to honor their parents. Loved it, loved it, loved it.",1291593600,,254,4.1
4242813,5,B0041H55SA,"From the music to the acting, everything was well done.

4242814,3,B0041H55SA,"Saw the play in Wichita. It was TERRIBLE! Cheesy production values, maudlin sentimentality, stereotypical characters, breaking the fourth wall... On the other hand, it was so bad it was good in a campy way. You're free to like Tyler Perry's work -- I do, as a guilty pleasure. Gotta love a big guy in drag. But please don't mistake him for a good writer.",1291334400,2,354,4.546875
4242815,5,B0041H55SA,I LOVE TYLER PERRY! I LOVE HOW AT THE END OF HIS PLAYS HE GIVES LIFE LESSONS THAT CAN RELATE TO ANYONE!!!! AND HE WAS SAYING SOME TRUE STATEMENTS AT THE END OF THE PLAY.. HAD ME SAYING AMEN LIKE I WAS IN CHURCH!! LOL BUT THIS MOVIE IS WONDERFUL!! I LOVED THIS PLAY!!!!!!!!!!,1291248000,,274,4.092592592592593
4242816,5,B0041H55SA,THIS PLAY WAS VERY GOOD AND IT HAD SOME TOUCHING MOMENTS THAT MADE ME CRY BECAUSE OF THE MOTHER WHO DIED OF CANCER IN THAT WHAT HAPPEN TO MINDS. THE YOUNGER AND THE OLDER GENERATIONS CAN RELATE TO THIS MOVIE.I REALLY DONT THINK ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 16 SUCH WATCH WITHOUT A PARENT.[WEED SMOKING] THIS FAMILY SHOWS THE TRUE NATURE OF JUS HOW SOME FAMILYS ARE IN THIS WORLD.OVER ALL MADEA DID A GREAT JOB ON PUTTING IT DOWN IN REAL TALK. A MUST SEE :),1291248000,,451,4.195402298850575
4242817,5,B0041H55SA,"I saw the play in Washington, D.C. in September, before, Mr. Perry decided to take a must needed break.  It was awesome to see the live version.  The singing, and the wisdom of Madea.  I am so glad I have purchased the play on dvd.  When I am being tested at work, I go home and get out my collection of Tyler Perry Plays, and I laugh, and say its going to be okay.",1291161600,,365,3.891891891891892
4242818,5,B0041H55SA,"This play has an underlying theme that cannot be ignored.  In life we need to make it right with those we care about because no one is promised another minute.  I enjoy Tyler Perry's plays because of the insight and wisdom he threads into his art.  Madea will always be the life of the show.  Her off script input, as well as scripted input, cannot be down played.  She has a knack for reaching your heart when you least expect it.  She admonishes the youth and provides direction for them (the scene when he tells the young man to pull up his pants and had him demonstrate how he walked both ways-this is a significant way to reach out to the youth and gently discipline them).  He also instructed women on how to act (the mother of the son's child was hanging on to the past, he told her to let go and move forward).  I think that is advice that is applicable to anyone's life.  Because, it is impossible to move forward if you're constantly looking back.  The past is called the past for a reason, let go and live!

The warmth and love is felt throughout the cast. They mesh like a real family and that is what people today need to see on the screen.  Yes, families have problems.  Yes, ALL families have certain members that do questionable things.  Yes, we're all imperfect.  Yes, we can make it right!  Yes, we can unite as a family!  Yes, Tyler Perry hit a homerun in making his point known!

And the voices!  Phenomenal!  The characters sound better in person then on the DVD, which seems almost impossible.  Tyler Perry is a wise man and may he continue to reach those (audience) that many have forgot about.

I saw the play in spring when it came to Norfolk, VA and I thoroughly enjoyed it, while sitting in the first row!  The only thing I can say about it was I was extremely nervous and careful not to direct any attention towards me because I did not want to become the spectacle of the show.  There were SEVERAL late comers and that is a no, no!  Especially sitting near the front!  I have heard Tyler Perry state before, be on time.  He/Madea left the script and totally put the various couples on blast!

I am glad I purchased the DVD.  The only thing I wish was that it included behind the scene footage (rehearsals) or bloopers.  There is no way every play was perfect!  Close to it yes, but on the nose?  No.  Any way, he receives 5/5 stars from me.

Tyler Perry, you rock!",1291075200,,2393,4.315315315315315
4242819,5,B0041H55SA,"Saw the play in New York at Madison Square Gardens Theater and I loved it live, now I'm going to enjoy it in my living room.  Didn't expect to get it so soon and it's brand new.",1291075200,,177,3.7837837837837838
4242820,5,B0041H55SA,"Tyler Perry has certainly done it again.  This is by far my favorite play of all!  Madea's Big Happy Family:The Play was life changing for me.  In this play Tyler Perry touched on so many things that just made me sit back and say hmmm.  From the way we treat our family members to the way women treat their husbands.

It is so true that when we do not treat our family members well while they are living, especially our parents, when they die we fall apart.  If you had been doing as God taught us to there would be no need for acting crazy at the funeral.  Peace would be all over when we live right.

Women treating their husbands like they are beneath them is outrageous.  Madea made a point in the play when she speaks about how the wives talk down to their husbands and about them to their family members.  They portray them to be weak assuming they have control over the men.  All the men want to do is love them.

I would recommend this play to everyone I know.  Madea may be a gun toting grandma but she speaks words of wisdom for all generations.",1291075200,,1055,4.189054726368159
4242821,1,B0041H55SA,"I like 99% of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, but this one sure falls in that 1%. Normally after watching one of his plays (especially I Know I've Been Changed which isn't on dvd) I feel like laughing, crying, shouting, screaming, and everything else. During this play, I was emotionless. The woman who played Aunt Bam (Ella from House of Payne) gave me a few chuckles, but even her character bored me after a while.

Its one of those things where you keep watching and watching waiting for the ""good part"", then next thing you know, its over and the good part never came. The singing was good as usual, but thats about it.",1290816000,4,623,4.464912280701754
4242822,5,B0041H55SA,"I have bought all the plays and movies of Mr. Perry, and in my opinion, this play was by far the best.  The message of the play is as family, we should love one another, and really respect and honor our parents, because you never know when God may call them home.  Tomorrow is not promised to us.  The play has humor as well as sadness and the singing is GREAT.  Don't want to give to much of the play away, but I will say, it was worth the money I spent for the DVD.",1290816000,3,467,3.8842105263157896
