8124475,4,B000FKP244,"ENJOYABLE..The plantation houses of Louisiana. These gracious homes have also beautiful exterior. Set in lush gardens, many close to the Bayou, where massive trees stand covered in hanging moss. We are taken to four of these very fine plantation houses, and are shown through all of the rooms. We also learn about the familys who lived in these four grand houses in those bygone days, and how they worked long and hard on their sugar plantions. I was very interested in this documentary.",1334793600,3,487,4.879518072289157
