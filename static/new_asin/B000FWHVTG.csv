8127490,5,B000FWHVTG,"It's Gatchaman, a cheesy cartoon from the 70s and my first introduction to anime, so of course I love it. If you're looking for something modern and deep, this is probably not your thing, but if you want some campy fun, go for it.",1418256000,,230,4.25
8127491,5,B000FWHVTG,"Nothing about this show is normal. Its like Speed Racer mixed with Power Rangers, add in stressful relationships and innuendo and BAM you have Gatchaman! There are several versions of this story. And even another season beyond that makes even less sense. As far as I know it never really finished, just got cut off. I imagine the manga had completion though.  It is entertaining however.  Especially when cranky Joe The Condor  goes nuts on occasion. If you love anime you kinda have to add this series to your collection.",1368748800,,522,4.777777777777778
8127492,5,B000FWHVTG,"I love this series and now own all 9 seasons which gives the view the complete story. The box art is beautifully done by Alex Ross. Be aware that this series is from the 1970's and the actual animation is done in that era and it has perfect English dub. The best part about this particular series is that its from the Japanese version which means its content wasn't edited for America so it dose include death scenes etc. If you purchase ""G-Force"" which is the Americanized version of Gatchaman you will lose some great scene that add to the story.",1366934400,,548,4.435643564356436
8127493,5,B000FWHVTG,"If you remember ""Battle of the Planets"", or ""G-Force"", these are the original Japanese episodes on which those are based.  This set includes episodes 85-95 of the series, which is where things really start getting good.  While there are a few sporadic great episodes or arcs before this, it seems as if this point the writers knew that the series was nearing a culminating point.

Earlier, the show could certainly be accused of being a ""monster of the week"" display, but here's where we start seeing our heroes really go through some S*)&T, and how they perform.  We really start learning about the characters here--Jinpei falls in love, Ken has to make some decisions, Condor Joe shows what he's made of, and you'll even love Dr. Nambu (sort of Commissioner Gordon character).  We also start to learn the secret of Berge Katse.  If you've only ever seen the American version, it seems very, VERY bizarre, but I have to give them credit; it's pulled off masterfully.

I don't want to spoil too much, but although this isn't the best of the series, it's where it starts getting really good.  I recommend watching once with the English dubs, so you get the plot, but you really have to watch the show in Japanese too.  The American actors do a fine job, but I get the impression they're kids doing it for a paycheck--the Japanese actors take it much more seriously, and the melodrama seems so much more intense and serious!

Extra's are slim: it was a good effort to have commentary on at least one episode per disc (I think?  Maybe just per set?), but the actors don't seem that *into* the shows.  I'd rather have a fan really nerd-out about it, but it is interesting to hear the voice actors talk about their experiences.

Enjoy, and buy these DVDs--they're awesome!",1354233600,,1767,4.661290322580645
8127494,5,B000FWHVTG,"...if you have never watched Gatchaman in your life and you like Japanese Animation ala Anime, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  I love old 1970's Anime like the original Mobile Suit Gundam and Gatchaman.  If you have watched Battle of the Planets in the past man it doesn't compare.  Battle of the Planets was an extremely watered down-made for kids version of Gatchaman.  The series does not contain nudity or anything like that, but the uncut ones show people getting killed--lots of them per episode.  Vol. 8 is the most intense of the series because the Science Ninja Team actually get defeated and their base gets destroyed by the evil Galactor.  Check them  out. You will not be disappointed. BTW-they are dubbed superbly in English, and also have Japanese original audio with subtitles. Tons of extras on the box sets.",1163462400,3,839,4.744827586206896
