1807329,1,B00007ELDC,Wishcraft is slow and didn't have anything to catch my interest.  In fact I gave it away before I even finished watching the entire movie.,1167782400,,138,4.52

1807331,5,B00007ELDC,"WISHCRAFT is a well crafted entry in the teen slasher horror flick, with a smart and unpredictable script and a real surprise at the killer's identity.  It also features the incomparable Zelda Rubinstein (Poltergeist dwarf) in a small role as the town's medical examiner.

Michael Weston plays Brett, the nerd who is pining after his classmate Samantha, played by the fetching Alexandra Holden (Purgatory Flats).  He receives a strange gift in the mail, which turns out to be a totem (actually a bull penis) that will grant him three wishes.  We know what his wishes will be...but coinciding with this are the brutal murders of some of Brett's classmates, and the viewer is left wondering how the two storylines will interconnect.  This is the surprisingly original twist writer Larry Katz has invented to separate this from so many of the routine straight to video thrillers.  Danny Graves also directs with a kinetic style and keeps the visuals interesting.  The supporting cast featuring Austin Pendleton, Michael ""Meatloaf"" Aday and A. J. Buckley are likewise effective.  A very surprising slasher.",1101686400,6,1102,5.151685393258427
1807332,4,B00007ELDC,"A greatly entertaining, extremely well-made movie about a love-stricken teenager (played by Michael Weston) who receives a strange totem in the mail, sent annonymously, that will supposedly grant its owner three wishes.  Ready to just toss it, he only makes a wish on it as a lark at the prodding of his friend; a wish that quickly comes to fruition.  Unfortunately, the wish also seems to set into motion a series of regrettable and sometimes gruesome incidents.  With Alexandra Holden doing a great job playing Weston's dream girl Samantha, ""Wishcraft"" is smart, very sexy, and has a nice cast of characters worth caring about.  It also successfully explores some of the comedic potential of its premise without making a fool of itself and killing its own status as plausible horror movie.  To top it off, this has far and away one of the greatest endings in all of movie history, not just horror movies.  Nine out of ten.

December 14 Revision - the above is my original review from October, where I gave it four stars.  As time goes by, though, I find this is more and more one of the movies that cements itself deeper in my memory as something really tremendous.  Some parts are merely good or very good instead of excellent, but the ending makes up for any minor shortcomings.  I can no longer justify keeping this at anything less than a full 5 stars.",1096502400,6,1358,4.668067226890757
1807333,2,B00007ELDC,"This movie is about a not so popular kid who, one day recieves a gift in the mail (its a ancient bull penis). so he grants a wish that he wants to go to the spring fling with this cheerleader and the next day it happens. So then he asks the magical bull thing to make her be his girlfriend and that happens and all the while jocks and goths are being slaughtered. Being hung on a street stop sign, being beheaded by a bowling ball and a recognizable Charlie Talbert(hes the fat kid in the movie Angus) gets killed by a samurai sword. some things weigh it down and some things spark it up. it's not the greatest of all movies but it aint the worst either. Meat Loaf Aday plays a cop named Sparky Shaw and the old lady from the Poltergiest movies pop up as a doctor. the kids best friend is hilaroud when he tries to wish he was Steven Seagal or where he fakes grieving over the dead jock just to get to see the hot councler and the part where they are in lunch and they talk about how that kid got some from the cheerleader who wore the pink underwear. and the bad guy at the ending sort of got me as well",1081900800,3,1104,4.0227272727272725
1807334,5,B00007ELDC,"I was very impressed with this movie. It has both good plot and good acting. It is even a little bit scary at times. It all starts out when Brett, a ugly unpopular out kast, recieves a...well i think it is a bull wiener....and it can grant wishes. He thinks its a total load of poopie and throws it away. His friend talks him into using it and he wishes that the most populare girl in school will go out with him. and she does. soon enough people start dying...some of them are quiet brutal...anyways the movie ending definatly suprised me! this movie is definatly worth watching if not buying.
Rated R for violence and language.",1077494400,3,629,4.431034482758621
1807335,4,B00007ELDC,"This movie caught my eye in the video store!!! The cover was really interesting!!!And I was going to put it back because it was never out in theathers, and so I thought that it was going to suck! But on the other hand, It didnt!!! Its like 1996's ""The Craft"" meets 1999's ""The Faculty"" The cast are great, the story is excellent, and the directing is stylish!!! I don't know why this wasn't released in theathers! But it should of been out in theathers!!! This movie is a MUST-SEE!!!",1056844800,5,483,4.438202247191011
1807336,4,B00007ELDC,"suprisingly good movie - i thought this one might be like the other teen slasher flicks but i was wrong. it was a unique film .i thought the killings were clever in the way they had diff ideas and it wasn't just ur average killing with knife like in most horror movies the killings were creative and the special effects were cool, the killings actually looked real and the story was pretty cool idea, the whole plot and the charcters were also good. The movie is about this guy who gets sent a mysterious (( totem )) sent to him in the mail and he takes it to a shop to find out what its worth and what it is and in the process learns some information about the powers it holds. When he goes home he makes 3 wishes and it leads to a series of events and mysterious killings start happening and noone knows who is doing the killing and you never think it is that person that is actually doing it- i was suprised at the end. so this is a unique film its dif than ur average teen slasher like i said-its very creative , unique original film and i recomend it- it was fun to watch.",1054598400,11,1077,4.109004739336493
1807337,5,B00007ELDC,"I didn't know what to expect when
popping this movie into my dvd player.
I heard some good things about it,
but good word of mouth does not a good
movie make. But in this case, it made a good
movie.....IMO.
It comes off as a teen romance comedy,
with slasher elements.
The one death scene, that stood out for me,
was the Hanging Scene. Seriously,
how it was done, was beyond words, and majorly cool,
in how they pulled it off.
The two gripes I had with this movie, was with
how some of the kills were more offscreen.
Where the kill would come, but then they cut away
so as to protect our fragile eye's...
The production values were grade A, in that it
was something that didn't appear to be a STV movie.
The killers motive, was average at best,
but compared to the one let out by the killer in
The Pool, it was far better then expected.
Give it a shot.",1043625600,2,852,4.13855421686747
1807338,2,B00007ELDC,"""Be careful what you wish for"". What an original catchphrase for a movie.
School geek Brett Bumpers (with a name like that it's hardly surprising) is in love with the Prom Queen, Samantha. He tutors her but of course she doesn't have the time of day for him because he's a loser who drives a wimpy... moped and she's a cheerleader.
But one day Brett arrives home from school to find a package containing a strange artefact which will grant him three wishes. Naturally he wishes for Samantha to fall in love with him, but soon things start getting stranger than usual and Brett's enemies start falling victim to a cowled and hooded ax murderer... who soon sets his sights on Samantha. As for the rest, you know the drill; or in this case, ax. Still, it's not a bad movie for killing time. The production values are good but if I had three wishes one would be for no sequels to this movie to get made. Just look at the PUPPET MASTER and WITCHCRAFT movies (at least 11 of them!!) for examples. (No relation to WISHCRAFT, but could that be a bad omen?).
The actual unmasking of the killer is pretty daft and the killers explaination for his (or is it her?) actions will have viewers chuckling. The movie even goes so far as to steal the voice changing gadget idea from the SCREAM trilogy. No prizes for originality there. The conclusion is also more drawn out than it needed to be. The movie's highlight would have to be the death-by-bowling-ball scene. Meat Loaf co-stars as a sheriff under the name Michael Aday (I thought his name was Marvin?) and squeaky voiced Zelda Rubinstein from ANGUISH appears as a coroner who has the intelligent line: ""Jimbo was alive when the killer took his head off"".(Really?).",1038528000,,1705,4.57516339869281
7975397,2,B00007ELDC,"Missed opportunities!  Great premise; poorly executed.  Had the chance of being something really special.  The female lead was a saving grace as she acted very well, however, others not so much.  The overall acting in the movie felt stiff and forced.  The tie in to the murders and the wishes lacked creativity and was lackluster.  The climax of the movie was cliche.  Did like the end in which the female lead did not reverse a particular wish (if you watch the movie, you will understand this comment...but really, go watch something else and save yourself the agony).  Hoping for a remake of this movie down the road in which they fix all of the glaring issues.",1496534400,,664,4.663793103448276
7975398,4,B00007ELDC,"A high school student is granted wishes after receiving a weird box with what appears to be a small animal carcass in the mail.  His wishes tend to revolve around a girl he tutors, that he wishes would like him as more than a friend.  In the meantime there's a killer stalking the area, and the film handles that part of it as a ""whodunit."" Wishcraft has a very late 90s, or early new millennium vibe to it, and benefits from solid lead performances by Michael Weston, who was also impressive in the under released film Cherry Falls, as well as during his brief appearance in the remake of the tv movie Helter Skelter, along with lead girl Alexandra Holden who's great looking and can act too. The revelation of the killer was pretty well brought off, but the finale went on a bit too long.  Still, if you're a mostly undiscriminating slasher film fan, this should fit the bill.",1447027200,3,878,4.475
7975399,3,B00007ELDC,"Better than I expected.  Actually, quite fun.",1410307200,,45,5.428571428571429
7975400,4,B00007ELDC,"I had to say it, movie it's good, a teenager flick for most of you but still has that cheesy feeling. Just be careful where you're buying it from, mine was not used, but abused in all the ways: disc, box, cover.",1364342400,,211,4.0476190476190474
7975401,3,B00007ELDC,"This movie is really a teen romance movie with a horror background. This would put this out there before the current crop of movies. Although great teen horror existed before in other movies and the great 'buffy the vampire slayer' tv series to name a classic. This one fufills the fantasy of every  young guy to wish that the super hot
gal will be HIS girl. And in this movie the gal is a nice person to begin with! That's what makes this better to a degree that the characters are good. The other teen characters though are not as well defined and only serve to die deaths that are off camera. which only proves that the horror element is not the real purpose here. In fact this may have been pitched as without any death at all to begin with. The bullies would get their comeupance and the boy would win the girl. But it's still a horror movie regardless if that's not the real focus of the flick. The reason being even if you don't see people die other than a few deaths , getting murdered is still horrible!. THe acting of the two leads is very well done and I would bet many a young man fell for the girl character. If not the actrees hereself. THe budget is typical for a b movie and it has meatloaf in it too as a police cheif. This is not a c movie though made by first timers without experience , people confuse b and c movies all the time. The dvd looks fine here and this one is worth a watch for those who want a teen romance movie mixed with some horror.  Of course there is a masked killer in this story whose motives are disclosed at the end of it but that's ok too.",1312588800,,1582,4.133116883116883
7975402,3,B00007ELDC,"Wishcraft is a pretty fun movie, but the one thing that sort of bugged me while watching it was the obvious lack of decent murders. I mean, one teenager is buried in the dirt and struck in the head with a bowling ball, and another is stabbed to death in a park after a lengthy scene involving immaturity and exaggeration. The only truly decent death is the one involving a teenage girl hanging from a cord beside the traffic signals.

The storyline is touched upon just enough to do the job and give the viewers something watchable. It was a spoof on the ""make three wishes and your dreams will come true"" fairy tales, but done in a much darker tone dealing with death and murders. I guess it was executed fairly, but I expected more.

The acting is good, and Zelda Rubenstein is incredibly spooky like always (even though she only appeared once and that was briefly) but I don't know... Meat Loaf playing the role of a police investigator is really strange. He wasn't believable enough to be a major threat or an intimidating factor if you ask me. All the lead characters were just so-so in their acting abilities.

The ""killer dressed up as death"" gimmick has definitely run its course (especially concerning annual Halloween costumes!) but I guess back in 2001 it wasn't really a big deal.

No, Wishcraft isn't the least bit frightening, and it has dated pretty poorly I believe. At least, what was once a film with a decent horror atmosphere is definitely no more, and it's a shame.",1309132800,,1486,4.575187969924812
7975403,5,B00007ELDC,"I expected Wishcraft to be an amusing fantasy flick, but the quality of this DVD completely amazed me. First of all, the cast is wonderful. While the idea of the plot sounds predictable, the writing is so clever and inventive I was continually surprised by the twists and turns. With no spoilers, I say that I certainly got my money's worth on the last scenes. We were dazzled by the finish.

Wishcraft is a comedy/horror/slasher/fantasy that will keep you laughing and guessing to the very end!",1301184000,,495,4.755813953488372
7975404,5,B00007ELDC,"This movie ""Wishcraft"" keeps you on the edge of your seat. It bases its main theme on the old saying ""Be careful for what you wish for"" and the consequences coming from not being careful of what wished for.",1270252800,,206,4.3076923076923075
7975405,5,B00007ELDC,"Yep, Alexandra Holden is beautiful! However, she's not the only reason to watch WISHCRAFT. The story is great, with many unexpected twists and gruesome turns. There's a lot going on that only makes sense at the end, and what an ending it is! Basic story: Highschool brainiac, Brett Bumpers (Michael Weston) pines for beauty queen / cheerleader, Samantha (Holden). One day, Brett receives a mysterious package containing a mummified bull's -(insert favorite euphamism here)-, which grants him 3 wishes. Brett makes his first wish, setting in motion a series of macabre, even murderous events. I was expecting just another SCREAM-ish formula movie, but instead, WISHCRAFT is unique and engrossing. Own this one now!...",1182124800,,716,5.345132743362832
7975406,5,B00007ELDC,"Alexandra Holden was in A Dead Calling recently and she was really good.  I really like her as an actress and she looked and played a school girl very well. However the films main character gave off a very strange vibe.  He was great but that constant ""lustful"" look he gave Alexandra Holden was more from an MAN than the ""raging harmone school boy"" he was suppose to play.........they should stick to people born after 1985 to play high school students..........and I think he was born in 1973

The movie was good..........BUT, I felt funny watching a supposedly high school boy and feeling a strange attraction to him being my age........and with todays society considering the ""teachers and students"" issues that have been in the news of late it does not promte a healthy image for older actors/actresses being cast as high school students...........sure, high school students now days look and act much older but not 30...... rent it just to check him out ladies..........it's okay to enjoy watching him now that you know this year he will be 34",1168128000,,1049,4.816666666666666
