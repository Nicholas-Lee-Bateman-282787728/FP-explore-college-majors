8760581,5,B01FBTBXNM,Steve Allen was one of the first late. Night talk show hosts and set a standard  for successors to follow. IT has the feel of a variety show with recurring cast members s well s weekly guests. It appeared to be live which lead to some very entertaining and naturally comical situations.  He was clever and challenged prior regimented formats. He had some very talented guest stars ncluding Tony Bennett and an array of comedians. It was interesting to observe that many cast members and guests spoked during the Show. Tony Bennett cut ally smoked while singing a song. The show was very innovative for its time and had flashes of Ernie Kovacs comic routines. He as vey innovative. He survived the test of time. The audio and video quality is acceptable when one considers the source. I hope edition all volumes are released.,1467158400,2,824,4.715277777777778
