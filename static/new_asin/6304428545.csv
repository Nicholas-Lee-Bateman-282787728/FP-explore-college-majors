876532,3,6304428545,"The director should be internationally condemned for the way this otherwise interesting movie was shot and cut.  The camera is always in the way, detracting from the story, adding ridiculous closeups of arms, legs, and noses, cutting away constantly--sometimes every other second--to provide a different view.  The jumping around was such that I had to watch the film after an intermission taken every 15 minutes.  My head was spinning when the time came to leave the room for a break.

The story is highly predictable for anyone who appreciates ballet.  Yes, it's a lot of hard work and pain.  Yes, it's interesting to see how ballet shoes are made.  Yes, ballet teachers shout and scream a lot.  Yes, it's glorious to be in show biz.  Yes, interviews with performers usually involve a lot of mumbling and cliches.  It all could have been done easily in 45 minutes instead of 90.

Here is a classic example of how not to shoot a movie.  Regretably, this style has become highly popular.  Some television commercials, for example, can rip your eyeballs out in the apparent attempt to emulate video games.  Which is yet another reason to ignore them.

What a shame that this film, with its fine young star, should have been so badly botched.",1217376000,17,1240,4.783018867924528
876533,5,6304428545,"I would recommend ""The Dancer"" (""Dansaren"" in Swedish) to anyone interested in dance of any kind, not just ballet.  There is so much to be appreciated in terms of the work, dedication and emotion that accompanies one's effort to succeed as a professional ballerina, and this DVD goes a long way toward conveying all these things to the viewer.

Katja Bjorner is the focal point of this documentary, as she can be seen practicing (so hard!) to get into form prior to a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Swedish Ballet.  Many of us know of the countless hours of physical duress involved in preparing to become a dancer with a national dance company.  In this film we see in her face, her feet, and practically every one of her muscles, how Ms. Bjorner strains to hardwire the beauty and grace of the dance into her body.

What I really liked about this film is that, rather than straight narration, some behind the scenes dialogue is brought out nicely through friendly chats with famous Swedish actor Erland Josephson, who may be playing the part of interviewer, but who seems truly intrigued and curious about many aspects of Ms. Bjorner's aspirations and stage persona.  He poses questions, and she takes care to describe all the elements and dance roles she needs to master in auditioning for the big show.  The documentary generally rotates through instruction, conversation, classes (boys and girls) and performance.  Check out the SLOPED dance floor in the ballet school, which is noted during conversation by Mr. Josephson.  The numerous scenes filmed in dance classes feature noteworthy ballet masters Valentina Savina, Michael Messerer and Aleksander Khmelnitski.  [Listen to Ms. Savina switching between Russian, Spanish and English during her classes!  FYI, no subtitles during the classroom scenes; they aren't needed].

There is also a VERY interesting segment which is filmed in the factory of Freed of London, perhaps the world's foremost designer/maker of ballet shoes.  Here we gain insight into the intense labor and skill involved in making ballet shoes; see how meticulous are the ballerinas in working with the designers to fashion a shoe that is perfect for the girls' foot shape, weight distribution, and balance.  It's great work . . . on both sides of the camera.

The final chapter is captivating, with footage alternating between Ms. Bjorner's on-stage performance, and her after-the-show animated account of what she was sensing when the spotlight was on her dancing.  Then Ms. Savina comes backstage and gushes some well deserved praise.

Get this, you'll like it.",1180915200,15,2597,5.05868544600939
876534,5,6304428545,"Katja Bjorner's dedication to ballet is revealed in a personal profile directed by Donya Feurer. Her tenacity is ever present during the vigorous training sessions where nothing less than perfection is acceptable.

Still, in this world of strict regimens, there is an undercurrent of elation as the dancers start to realize their dreams. The teachers express a warmth and patience that reveals they must truly believe in their student's ability to excel beyond expectation.

One of the highly intriguing aspects of this sensitive portrait is how the ballet shoes are created. While dance itself is portrayed with exquisite beauty, the life behind the scenes is captured with equal clarity. The Dancer reveals the life of a ballet student from every angle, except having a personal life or friends outside of class seems completely absent.

The dedication it takes to reach the desired level of perfection sweeps everything aside in favor of an art form that brings breathless beauty to the stage.

876535,5,6304428545,"I truly enjoyed this documentary. The work and dedication that dancers need is shown in a wonderful light. I was very interested in the short clips of the pointe shoe making process.

876536,5,6304428545,"Though I am not a dancer, I love anything having to do with ballet. I discovered this little film many years ago and rented it probably about 30 times from the video store. I recently purchased it on DVD and found that I still adore every moment of it. There is something compelling (as the narrator of the film also sees) about the dedication it takes young people to become professional dancers. This film brings to life the incredible hard work of dance students. Though there are snippets of certain performaces, what really draws you in are the rehearsals, warm-ups and stretching, for that is where the real meat of ballet lies. If you love dance, you'll love this film.",1154908800,51,676,4.641666666666667
876537,5,6304428545,"This artistically produced DVD was a joy to watch.  Closeups of the dancer's feet and her perspiring face drove home the dedication of this young dancer.  For anyone who thinks ballet is easy or something to be taken lightly, this will change your mind and make you see the beauty that is possible with dedication and hard work.  I especially enjoyed how the dancers were corrected, as when the teacher told the dancer to go more to second position with her working leg before turning her foot back to arabesque.  This type of attention to detail makes all the difference in dance training and this is packaged beautiful into an entertaining picture to view.",1139356800,81,658,4.745614035087719
876538,5,6304428545,"If you like ballet documentaries then this one should be in your collection.  We do not often get to learn much of what goes on in the Northern European Ballet Community, which has made very important contributions to the ballet tradition, so this is all the more welcome.  It is an intimate behind the scenes look into the Royal Swedish Ballet and its school.  We are shown the daily routines of the dancers in training, both female and male.  Mostly, we follow the daily routine of Katja Bjoerner, a young lady who is one of Sweden's hopes for a prima ballerina.  There are many classroom scenes with group and private instruction at the professional level, both barre and center, as well as stage rehearsals.  Some of the dialogue is in Swedish with English subtitles, but a lot of English is spoken also.  Katja speaks perfect English.

876539,5,6304428545,"In watching ""The Dancer,"" I'm struck by how much time and work dancers, teachers, and even shoe makers put into perfecting their craft. ""The Dancer"" shows glorious dancing in some wonderful performance sequences, but even more important it shows the work behind creating those moments that have so often taken my breath away. I love watching good dancing on stage, but what this film reveals is the endless amount of work it takes to get there... the rehersals, the constant feedback from the trained eyes of teachers, the impossible stretches, and even the making and fitting of the pointe shoes. I'm no ballet dancer, but watching this makes me appreciate the process of beautiful dancing (perhaps even more than the performance.)",1104710400,4,732,5.0578512396694215

Endless tendus at the barre, sewing of satin bands  to toe shoes, and aching muscles tell her story in a beautiful way. It  starts and ends at the barre, exactly where every ballerina should be  found.

876699,3,6304428545,"First the bad: Way too much of this film is spent in close up of the dancer's face. And a few creepy close ups of her body. I'm not saying we shouldn't see a dancer's body since that is her instrument. What I am saying is that we really don't need a close, slow pan of her chest. More of her feet, please. Other bad: the bottom of my screen flashed throughout the whole film. Maybe just a bad connection on this one.

Having said that, I enjoyed the dance elements of the film, though they be disjointed. I liked watching classes / individual instruction by various ballet masters / mistresses. Hearing the dancer speak about her craft was also interesting. And getting to see other dancers, including male dancers, work their craft was fun.

If you have an hour and a half and need a diversion while you're cooking supper or folding laundry or something (and can still read subtitles), I'd recommend this one. Or if you live and breathe ballet, give it a go.",1432944000,2,959,4.443181818181818

An important tool for any serious ballet dancer is a good fit and support of her shoes to prevent injury and make dancing easier.  It could have been a topic for another documentary or placed in a more appropriate place in the movie.  I saw the importance of having a good coach integral to getting to the top of any field and not just in ballet.  It was interesting to note the pain the dancers must endure even on stage.  You would think to watch them on stage that it was effortless on their part.  In a way, the ones with the talent and determination to be the best, are trying to attain perfection.  A cautionary tale with dire consequences not address in this movie.  All in all, in interesting look into what it takes to become the best.",1431302400,2,849,4.432258064516129

As a dancer, I enjoyed seeing the reality of ballet. The scene, which appears to show Katia first going up on pointe, can remind any other dancer, how hard it is, you can't show expression and her sweating and shaking were quite real.
The foreshadowing ( going from present to dream9 reminds me of Ingmar Bergman films.
Also, showing body parts, especially, the hard word that goes into making those parts work correctly.
The sad part for me, not necessarily what I like to see, was the growing of Katia and, consequently the aging of the other dancer. The ability to dance Romeo and Juliet leaves us too soon. The stamina plus not being able to look 16 anymore, is a professional acceptance.

Watch the blond (older) teacher and compare the poise and natural ability, including natural turnout, to that of the main character who unfortunately seems to have tried to force her turnout beyond her physical ability and has become somewhat knock-kneed which unfortunately hurts her otherwise beautiful lines.

876917,4,6304428545,"This documentary focuses mostly on Katja Bjorner, a young aspiring ballet dancer and student of the Royal Swedish Ballet School.  It gives the viewer an inside look at the daily life and work of a ballet dancer and student.  Although some of the information shared is unique for a ballet documentary, such as how point shoes are made and the intimacy of a student and coach working one on or what a dancer does between classes and rehearsals, what really makes this documentary stand out is Katja herself.  This dancer has an artistry you just don't see anymore in the ballet world.  Today ballet dancers have become more like athletes.  Katja pays attention to the small details, the intricate movements that bring style and character to ballet.  Every single movement, every detail is paid attention to and she dances and works with joy and love for her art; with an utter respect for it.  This is a humble dancer with an incredible expressiveness.  She is a rare talent and she alone makes this documentary worth watching over and over.
At times I did find myself getting frustrated at how the scenes flicked from one shot to another without a chance to absorb any of it, almost frantically.  Other times the focus was too close on only the faces of the dancers for too long, beyond necessary while sacrificing overall shots.  At the end I was left wanting to see so much more, feeling almost robbed.  But the artistry of Katja as well as the insight of some of the instructors and other artists made it worthwhile. I would still recommend this documentary to anyone interested in ballet.  It offers a refreshing positive perspective that doesnt include the usual blood, sweat, tears, and anorexic young girls with cruel coaches.  It is not bleak at all, but full of life and art.  This is ballet at its finest (but maybe not filmography at its finest).",1324944000,8,1856,4.705882352941177
876985,3,6304428545,"Overall, a lovely film, but I'm frustrated because although I appreciate the close-ups, I want to see their bodies dance! Lots of ""artsy"" close-ups that would have been more impactful used more sparingly. It made me watch Katja's face when I would have been otherwise distracted by her gorgeous limbs, etc. It made me look at dance through a different lense so to speak (so a positive in that sense). However, these dancers are beautiful and amazing and I want to see more feet and legs and well, their bodies as a whole! It's almost a tragedy. The cinematography is definitely shot from a non-dancer's point of view... lots of focus on the face and upper body (often a pet peeve amongst dancers). I was left wanting so much more from this film simply because I did not get enough true dancing. Dance is not just one specific part of the body doing specific motions, but the body as a whole creating a piece of art. It's like showing snippets of a painting and saying you're doing it justice... which is obviously not true.

All in all, I think I would recommend watching this simply because when you do see the true dancing, it's worth any frustration. As far as purchasing, I am glad I simply watched a friend's copy becuase I don't know if I can watch it again due to my irritation with it. So, if you are a dancer, just beware of the cinematography if this is the sort of thing that irks you.",1314921600,13,1396,4.4319066147859925

Was also very interesting to see how ballet shoes are made and fitted so that the muscles from the arch to the hip must be balanced correctly and engaged.  The various teachers interviewed were also a great insight into ballet even though they are all speaking in different languages!
Thought this was one of the best ballet films for the craft of the dance.",1312070400,,640,4.444444444444445

876988,5,6304428545,"This is an understated beauty film about a small handful of dancers, not about dance.  It's focus is on the personalities of the dancers, not the technical aspects of dance.  Beautiful dreamy photography, but also gives a glimpse of the difficulties and dedication needed to dance professionally, but not so much that it ruins the film.",1308787200,,336,4.982142857142857
876989,5,6304428545,"With the exception of the sometimes what my children have called ""scarey movie music"" this is a wonderful doc/film about dance.  I agree with another poster that the up close and personal footage of the dancer, Katya (sp?) is amazing.  It really gives you a sense of the effort involved in classical ballet and the extraordinary work these young women and men put into their craft.  I have rented this film a number of times and definitely recommend owning it to anyone who enjoys ballet.",1290556800,,488,4.7176470588235295
876990,5,6304428545,"This film grabbed me by my metaphorical throat and didn't let go, which is pretty much what a good ballet performance does.  I don't love every bit of it.  Sometimes it is self-consciously filmic, but I forgive the intrusiveness because it is done in pursuit of a strong point of view, which is brilliantly expatiated.  On first viewing, I thought rather too much time was spent showing us how point shoes were made, and fitted, and trimmed, etc.  but the point is that dance of this kind is part of a long and communal tradition.  The shoes are made the same way that they were one hundred years ago, or two hundred.  And as this becomes clear, we gain a perspective on the elements of the dance itself, and see it as part of a grand, and extremely  demanding tradition.
For those of us who are not dancers, we see in beautifully lit and patient detail the elements of rehearsal, the details of the body, the joints, the muscles, the skin, the geometry of movement, the yogic elements of both extreme concentration and mind-body  interconnection, all combined in the service of this art, which is a culmination of all these, in the service of narrative.
Much contemporary ballet takes a combination of two ""popular"" tropes: ballet is becoming up to date, and is now all about a contemporary dance perspective, half-apologetically dragging its tradition behind; or, ballet is celebrated because of its glitzy, super-athletic emphasis on speed and leaps and increasingly harsh lighting, modern costuming, muscular males dancers, and exaggeratedly anorexic girls and women.
In The Dancer, we are given a view of the extreme, perfect elegance of the basic motions of the dance, and a serious, patient analysis of gesture, and line, and narrative expression. We see dancing as both a kind of meditation, and as an intelligent rhetoric of expression. Watch this magnificent film very, very, very  closely, and you will rejoice in the subtlety of this art, the beauty of the dance, and of the dancer.",1275696000,,1994,4.8584070796460175
876991,4,6304428545,"This is an interesting documentary on the professional development of a young and aspiring ballerina, but there are too many long head shots of her at the barre with her brows wrinkled in concentration, while the viewer is left wondering what the rest of her body is doing to make her breathe so hard. It could easily have been edited down to about 70 minutes, with no loss of content or impact.",1271808000,5,395,4.5
876992,2,6304428545,"What could have been a marvelous video for ballet lovers is fatally flawed.  The ballerina is fine but 40% of the video is spent looking at her face and some of that in her ear.  We see flashes of costume, elbow, hand but few full body, which in dance is after all the whole purpose.  Whirling boy bodies give us no idea whether they can dance at all.  The movie behaves like a dear aunt's home video.  Toobad",1262217600,26,409,4.1923076923076925
876993,5,6304428545,"For those who wish to dance (or have children that THINK they want to dance), this is a most excellent dvd to watch.  I knew that Ballet dancers had their routines that they go through, but you get a little of the technical side of the business (and the Ballet Shoemakers slaving away is interesting too!).  I've watched this multiple times, Ms. Bjorner moves me to at least exercise (that's something, I suppose...).  I can't heap any more praise on this dvd that hasn't already been given.  I too, rate this DVD 5 stars!  See for yourself (and decide)!!",1259020800,,555,4.565656565656566
876994,5,6304428545,"This is a very nice portrayal of what it's like behind the scenes for a dancer working her way up in a prestigious ballet company (The Swedish Royal Ballet)--the nitty gritty of hours of hours of workout, and what it's like to live that life.  Also informative about how ballet shoes are constructed, and a behind the scenes look at the costume department, and general production concerns.  A definite must for any dance or ballet aficionados, and for anyone considering it as a career, but also a joy for anyone who loves the performing arts.  The narration is pleasant, unobtrusive, and expertly handled by the famous Swedish actor, Joseph Erlandson, who has been in a number of Ingmar Bergman's films.",1249603200,,704,4.85

The movie captures an interesting moment in time before snapchat and twitter, a slightly calmer time with a  VCR quality to the film.  Katja focus on her ballet and the cinematographer on Katja create mesmerizing harmonies. As someone who studied ballet in a pre-professional contest at about the same age it a evokes the commitment and passion required to prepare for a life on stage.",1456444800,,540,4.923076923076923
