7562566,5,B01940YDD6,"SPOILER ALERT ahead!

I'm proud to be the first to review this excellent program! Superb series, engrossing, exciting and intriguing. Almost never any dead time or slow spots in this engaging drama of a small French village under the German occupation during World War II. The tensions between the French who collaborate in the interests of protecting their friends, family and neighbors, and those who resist---mostly for political reasons (a lot are Communists) is explored in a serious, non-trivializing manner. For example, the doctor/mayor struggles mightily with his dilemma: he cooperates with the Wehrmacht leadership in order to protect the citizens who he has lived with all his life. But he gets grief for it from some people, because it requires him to make decisions which hurt the very same people. Like at one point the Germans plan to execute 20 hostages because of a Resistance attack on a German officer. He is able to negotiate this down to 10 hostages---but HE must decide which 10. You sympathize with his agony over deciding which of his neighbors will be killed. These are decisions which will surely plague him the remainder of his life.

The series offers a great deal of historical realism, from my reading of true-life accounts of the Occupation. Plus my mother and grandmother, along with their relatives, lived 4 years in Paris under the Germans so I have some direct familiarity with people who lived under the experience. However there are some incidents which strike me as rather incredible. I don't consider them to hurt my enjoyment of the series and I doubt they would yours. Unfortunately, they want the ""heroes"" of the show to do heroic things and survive to appear in the next episode so some incidents stretch credibility. Like when the mayor aids his brother's escape, after the brother is being pursued for direct involvement in the cold-blooded shooting of a German officer. The German secret police, the SD, arrest him and start to even torture him but the local Wehrmacht commander, who has a cordial working relationship with the mayor, intercedes and frees him. He also arranges to send the SD man to the Eastern Front! This strikes me as incredible in the extreme. Sure during the initial months of the Occupation the Germans tried to tread somewhat lightly ON the French in the hope that they could eventually bring Vichy into the Axis as a full-fledged member. But surely a small town mayor who assists the escape of an assassin is going to get some kind of punishment beyond a few bruises. A similar incident occurs earlier where a woman is tortured into providing the name of her Communist cellmate and then released. She quickly tips off her comrades who take action to avoid capture. Surely the Germans at least would have kept her incarcerated until they rounded up the members of the cell.

What I also like greatly about the series is that most of the characters are complex... not the usual black-and-white paintings typical of war movies. The Commandant is a human being; the German sergeant is an artist who falls in love with the French school teacher;, the mayor's brother, albeit a communist, questions the mindless orders that come down from headquarters; Schwartz, played masterfully by Thierry Godard (Spiral) is torn about keeping his business alive (and his employees working) by providing lumber and concrete to the Wehrmacht; even the SD chief, Muller, while reprehensible in the end, is shown as a creature with a human side, a very rare fictional depiction for a member of the Gestapo/SD. In some ways the worst-behaved person in the entire show is the mayor's wife, played by the delectable Audrey Fleurot (of Spiral), who cheats on her saintly spouse repeatedly, finally sleeping with the SD officer and even going beyond the pale when she uses information obtained from her nephew to tip off the SD that her hunted brother-in-law will be visiting the mayor's home secretly that night. This is a betrayal so palpable that the mayor's decision to divorce her finally comes as a relief.

The series shows its stereotypical French origin in the number of instances of adultery, fornication, pregnancies outside of marriage, etc., which only adds to the intensity of the stories! More seriously it also addresses the complex and sometimes deplorable attitude French people had/have toward the Jews who live in their communities.

Highly recommended! I only hope they rush out Season 3 through 6, with English subtitles, since it will be frustrating to have to wait months or years to see how the series advances.",1454371200,10,4581,4.959635416666667

7562568,5,B01940YDD6,"This is a great ensemble of characters.  Can't wait to see all the way into Sea. 6.  So tragic some of it, it seems that there are not enough stories to cover all the atrocities that the Nazis did to these peoples.",1494374400,2,214,4.071428571428571
7562569,5,B01940YDD6,Love it,1493510400,,7,3.0
7562570,5,B01940YDD6,"Even though I'm not a big fan of having the Communists as the main theme of this season, as their dialectics just annoy the heck out of me. I do enjoy the Suzanne Richard character. Then again she not really a dyed-in-the-brainwashed Communist. Also, frankly, the Communists seem full of themselves and just plain bizarre. Leaflets? Seriously? Even for the WWII period, did these ever change people's opinions even the ones dropped by planes into enemy territory?

The season's best scene was a total surprise in a season full of superb twists. Sarah, the mayor's family maid, gets arrested for basically being a stateless Jew. She tears apart the mayor's whole ethos by pointing out it's...well, I won't ruin it for anyone. It's so spot on about the French whose hearts are in the right place but who only continue to fuel the oppression of the Jews.

So it goes. Yet another great season, and I'm totally hooked. The only thing that does bug me a ton is Hortense with her wide-eyed shocked eyeballs in almost every scene. Her acting seems to rely on a look of surprise no matter what the scene entails. Compare her with Marie (Mr. Schwartz's lover) and her far more nuanced acting. No comparison.

The extras on the DVD set are similar to Season One with short talking head clips from French WWII survivors on the following:
--The Aryanization of property
--The Nazi invasion of Russia (which is key to flipping the Communists' attitude towards the German occupation)
--Status of women during the war as they gained more independence because they were pretty much forced to hold down the home front
--Franco-German love affairs (We hear from some children of those relationships.)
--Elites at the Crossroads (how French society began to change because of WWII)
--Hostages (the other main theme of the Season was how this tactic was used by the Germans)

Also, this season was far better from the very first episode on vs. Season One which I felt took a couple of episodes to get rolling.",1493337600,,1989,4.790087463556851

7562586,5,B01940YDD6,"We just finished this Season 2 of A French Village. (Purchased Season 1 several weeks ago, watched it, then just had to have Season 2.) I'm hoping the prices goes down a bit before I buy the remaining seasons. I surely wish that Amazon or someone would package all the seasons in a less-expensive packet so we wouldn't have to buy everything piecemeal and at a higher cost.

This is an excellent series set during the Nazi Occupation of France. It is full of intrigue and full of the good, the bad, and the ugly of human nature. I highly recommend it.",1471046400,3,551,4.401960784313726
7562587,5,B01940YDD6,"If you're a devotee of the French Resistance movement, you will want to own a copy of this series.  It's very well done, and by all accounts and what I know of the French Resistance, a pretty true-to-life account of the day- to- day struggles faced by the Free French and the Communists as they struggled together to defeat the ""Boche"".  It was not a simple struggle - each having its own agenda and each dealing with collaboration, black market, Jews in hiding, just to name a few.  I could go on and on about the merits of this series, possibly the best out there dealing with this topic, but you should really see for yourself.  My review does not give it justice.",1470787200,,667,4.3983739837398375

7562589,5,B01940YDD6,"This show keeps getting better.. If that's even possible. The characters are so well developed and so well played. Got to admit was a tad tired of Hortense's shenanigans. She went from devoted wife and mother to .well I'll leave that for you to figure out or I'm blowing the plot. The tension from the occupation is rising. Any resistance meets with Germans taking hostage and at one point, the Mayor barters with them-if he makes a list will the reduce the number they're about to shoot? They agree and he's left with decisions you know will haunt him. He is looking more and more exhausted and I have to wonder if he's about to break. Miseur Schwartz is turning into quite the callous sod, but maybe he'll finally ditch his nasty wife. The lovely Luciene is faced with tough choices with her Franco-German love affair-I have to say, I'm adoring the school principal Mr Beriot... I hope he gets a happy story-he maintains cheer for his students, rouses up the community with a ""dance"" (dancing is outlawed But he finds a way to bring it into an event The smiles on the locals faces clearly make it worthwhile). I wish I knew where this was filmed. The town is quite lovely. The extras at the finish are a lovely touch. A short segment from a leading historian on what was occuring in France and interviews with people who recall it. Makes you see just how well done this show is. Can't wait for the next season. Get this show!! The love, despair, joy, horror-very moving and heartfelt",1463356800,2,1485,4.544776119402985
7562590,5,B01940YDD6,"The difficulty in writing a review of Season 2 of A FRENCH VILLAGE is twofold: first, it requires a trip to the thesaurus to look up more superlatives and second, the time it takes to write a review could better be spent watching Season 3!

But seriously, Season 2 of this highly-acclaimed international hit is every bit as good as--and in some ways better than--Season 1.

Occupation under the Nazis has never been as thoroughly explored as it is in this splendid French series.  Characters we have come to love or admire or be repulsed by continue to be developed.  More and more layers are added to each character suggesting a sort of contemporary Bayoux Tapestry depicting the experiences of WWII-era France, all brilliantly encapsulated into the life of a single village.

There isn't an unnecessary scene in the whole series.  Every moment counts by advancing the story line and taking the characters to places we never thought we'd find them.  And when events at times appear to resemble a soap opera the viewer is quickly reminded that what is on display is simply LIFE in all its complexities.  Yes, there is a focus on the romantic entanglements (a much more appropriate word here than ""relationships"") of the central characters, but one need only remember the precarious times people were living in then.  The uncertainly, when anyone could die at any time and when one truly couldn't say what tomorrow would bring create a world where the simplest of human interactions become the most fulfilling: the discovery of new love, the reading of a bedtime story to an innocent child, or the quality of mercy that emerges when a person's character is sorely tested.

This is the stuff of greatness: epic storytelling, firmly grounded in truth that appeals to lovers of history in particular but equally to anyone who appreciates intelligent, morally complex drama.

Don't be put off by the subtitles.  It would be a sin to dub this into English.  It is so gloriously FRENCH that it must be heard in its original language.
