2772858,4,B000NO1XG8,"When the Greeks started acting in the first plays their dramas were considered to be an imitation of life (""mimesis""), and there was no pretense that the stories they were telling were what really happened.  This explains why all the great tragic playwrights have their own versions of the slaying of Clytemnestra.  Today we find that Hollywood lawyers have boilerplated into the end credits of every film the bald faced declaration that any everything is fictitious and any resemblance to actual people, places, animals, vegetables or minerals is purely coincidental, even when they are ""real"" people, places, etc.  That makes it rather interesting that at the beginning of ""Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus,"" there is an additional caveat as we are told: ""Unlike a conventional biography, this film takes the bold step of merging reality and fantasy to explore the emergence of a singularly brilliant artist and great American photographer Diane Arbus.""

Actually, there are so many warnings about how this 2006 film is not even remotely close to being a true story that I found myself wondering if it even should have been about Diane Arbus.  If you do not know who Arbus was you might feel yourself to be at a disadvantage in watching this film, but really all you need to know about the real person is that her first name was pronounced ""Dee-ann,"" that she made her reputation taking black & white photographs of people who would most charitably be described as living on the fringe of American society, and that she committed suicide in 1971 at the age of 48 by swallowing a whole lot of barbiturates and then cutting her wrists open.  What happens in this film has everything and nothing to do with any of that, so you are free to make of the proceedings what you will.

Nicole Kidman plays Diane, who finds little fulfillment in being the both wife and assistant to her husband Allan (Ty Burrell) and does not appear to be comfortable as a mother to her children or a daughter to her parents (Harris Yullin, Jane Alexander) either.  Finding a giant wad of hair and a key in her water pipe, Arbus assumes that the new neighbor upstairs has been trimming the hair of his dog and letting it go down the drain.  This turns out not to be the case as we learn why Lionel Sweeney, played by Robert Downey Jr., walks around in a variety of exotic masks.  My first thought actually was of Fedor Jeftichew, better known as Jo-Jo the Dog-Face Boy (later Jo-Jo the Dog-Face Man), and then the movie that immediately came to mind was Jean Cocteau's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Belle-et-la-bte/dp/B000BG08MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Belle et la bte</a>."" But I understand that younger viewers with less eclectic interests would immediately think Chewbacca from ""Star Wars.""

""Fur"" is described as ""a startling combination of fairytale, psychological study, period piece and love story,"" and it is hard to argue with that list.  Once you buy into the idea that this story is totally invented concerning a period of her life of which little is known (assuming you are willing to do so), you can just go along for the ride.  The idea here is to tell the story of Diane Arbus' first photograph and to come up with a first subject who would be emblematic of all the other photographs to come.  Arbus' photographs have been described as being like ""Alice in Wonderland"" for adults, and Fur embraces that idea from start to finish, but the fantastic elements become secondary as soon as the connection between Diane and Lionel is established.

More than the life of Diane Arbus my reference point for this film was really the fact that director Steven Shainberg and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson previously worked together on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretary/dp/B00008DDSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretary</a>.""  That kinky little film is actually and  surprisingly one of my favorite love stories of recent years, and I see ""Fur"" as being very much in the same key, what with love overcoming decidedly different barriers through the efforts of a strong tandem of actor and actresse (James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal in that case).  Reducing Downey to acting primarily with just his eyes and his voice only serves to remind us of how good he is and why I have never had the animosity towards him that I frequently direct against public figures engaging in self-destructive behavior.  Both Downey and Kidman play it small in this film in order to create something large but still fragile.  Like the photographs of Diane Arbus, this movie combines things that are beautiful and disturbing.  This will not sit well with everyone, which is utterly appropriate.",1178928000,22,4761,5.062659846547315
2772859,4,B000NO1XG8,"The division of opinion in responses to FUR - AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS is a healthy one and it is reassuring to read so many fine views of the film's worth.  Diane Arbus remains one of the more important artists of the 20th century, a woman who defied societal taboos and entered the world of the marginal people - fellow human beings whose genetic inheritances could be viewed as either curses or variations of normal.  Without making judgments Arbus photographed little people and giants, people with less than four limbs, people with deformities both skeletal and flesh defined, people whose life styles influenced at times grotesque appearances: in the end the common denominator is 'people'.  She was unafraid to observe and to capture nature's variations.

How this great artist transitioned from the ordinary life of the 'proper wife and mother' of the 1950s to the world of the bizarre has always been a story that begged to be told.  In this film, loosely based on the biography by Patricia Bosworth as adapted by Erin Cressida Wilson, driven director Steven Shainberg strives to create a story that would explain the transition.  It is only a story and to judge it as honest biography would be incorrect.  It is fantasy and one that is a clever, if overdone, explanation for Arbus' choices she made in her private life and in her artistic life.

As Diane Arbus, Nicole Kidman once again inhabits the role of a very strange personality and does it so well that she manages to take us along  the odd journey on which she embarks.  Her nice but mundane husband Allan (Ty Burrell) allows her to explore the presence of a new tenant Lionel (Robert Downey Jr.), encouraging his frustrated wife to take up photography on her own rather than serving as his assistant for the fashion magazine images he grinds out. Lionel is covered with hair (hypertrichosis) and as a sideshow freak has many friends who have deformities.  Arbus enters this world, loves the freedom of expression she has longed for, and in time falls in love with Lionel, leaving her family to enter completely the vision she has discovered (this is not a spoiler as the film opens with this information).

Yes, Shainberg can be criticized for excess and for pushing the boundaries of credibility, but for this viewer that approach enhances the concept of visualizing the epiphany in an artist's life when the world changes to a form the artist can then capture and share.  The sets, photography, and the acting fit the idea - even the far too prolonged love scene/body shaving sequence and aftermath that can only be described as bizarre.  The film is obviously a work of love and one that honors the life of Diane Arbus, even though we are not given much true information about the woman.  Veteran actors Jane Alexander and Harry Yulin add to the dignity of the project, as does a fascinatingly simple musical score by Carter Burwell.  This is a film for those who appreciate fantasy as a means of relating a history: for those who need factual biographical approach this film will not appeal.

2772860,5,B000NO1XG8,"From reading reviews here at Amazon and speaking to other movie goers, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of those films where depending on the personality/likes/dislikes of the viewer, you'll either love it or hate it.  I personally loved it.  Loved the acting of the entire cast, loved the costuming, directing, make-up and cinematography.

I love a great love story.  Please note, that the title clearly states that this is ""An IMAGINARY Portrait of Diane Arbus"".  Perhaps another film maker wants to tackle a different, more true-to-life version at some point in the future, but in this particular take of her life, the real Diane  serves mearly as a loosly based mold for the Diane of this film.

For me personally, this was one of those films that stuck with me for days after I saw it at the theater.  I thought it was brilliant!  It reminded me a bit of the '80's T.V. show ""Beaty and the Beast"".

My suggestion?  Rent this before you buy it.  If you love it, you'll watch it again and again and will definetly want to purchase it.",1177977600,47,1049,4.550802139037433
2772861,2,B000NO1XG8,This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.,1172361600,19,704,4.8264462809917354
2772862,4,B000NO1XG8,"I didn't realize, when I went to see this film, that the director

was also responsible for ""Secretary"", but in retrospect this makes

perfect sense. Both films concern themselves with the twisted side

of humanity, or perhaps, the humanity of kink. ""Fur"" chronicles the

imaginary but convincing awakening of Diane Arbus to her true

fascination with the grotesque. Frustrated and oppressed by her

life as a vanilla 1950's housewife, Diane yearns for something more.

She sees the bizarre and disturbing details in her surroundings that

others miss, but thus far has not had the courage to record her

observations.

When she catches a glimpse of Lionel (Robert Downney Jr.), completely

masked, she somehow recognizes him as the key to escaping her

suffocating life. He sends her the key to his apartment, through

the sewer pipes, an apt metaphor. Hesitant at first, then exuberant,

she surrenders to her true self, the beautiful, poised woman

surrounded by dwarves and siamese twins who is nevertheless, in

Lionel's words, a ""real freak"". For Diane, this is badge of

honor.

Diane's fascination with the bizarre, and with Lionel, is intensely

sexual. The tension between the two protagonists is maintained

through the film, gradually turning to desperate longing.

Yet they hardly touch. Their inevitable coupling near the

end of the film seems anti-climatic. The real climax is the

terribly intimate and prolonged scene in which Diane shaves

Lionel's entire body.

I'll agree with other reviewers that the ending of the film

falters. Nevertheless, this movie touched me deeply, and I

recommend it highly.",1171065600,96,1623,5.214007782101167
2772863,5,B000NO1XG8,"I would 1st of all change the title to ""HAIR or The Inner World of Diane Arbus"". I think the title, FUR may have left a bunch of people out. The film is SPECTACULAR! Simply AMAZING! Rich in Detail and the inner life, inspiration and passion of a human being. Anyone who judges this film from a biographical perspective or a realistic point of view will be disappointed - but this film surpasses all of that! In delves into a RICH, DEEPER world of the heart of the artist in all of us! Nicole Kidman, as always, delivers 100%, along with the subtle, gentle and elegant acting from Robert Downey Jr. Ty Burrell is truly and fully captivating as the husband who no longer has emotions to fulfill his wife. Steven's directing is mesmerizing, filled with brilliant detail, structured continuity and encompassing all of the human senses.",1167868800,41,831,4.659863945578231
2772864,1,B000NO1XG8,"Nicole Kidman is a brilliant actress, who makes bold choices and doesn't play it safe. I think that's commendable, but the natural result is that for every brilliant movie she's in (The Hours, Moulin Rouge), there's one that's odd (Birth) or just bad (Bewitched).

Fur is the worst of them all. Neither Kidman's luminous presence nor Robert Downey Jr.'s talent are enough to save this wreck. Whoever described it as a freak show was being generous.

The idea of replacing Diane Arbus's fascinating real life with this ""imaginary portrait"" was a bad one, the screenplay is terrible, and the direction is even worse. I hope Kidman's next project will be better (at least it can't be worse) and more suited to her enormous talent.",1164585600,20,727,4.854838709677419
2772865,3,B000NO1XG8,"Nicole Kidman has made some brave career choices; some of these choices were both brave and bad (""Birth""), some were just bad (""Bewitched"", ""Dogville""). She is clearly an actress willing to take a chance and occasionally, these pay off, providing a delightful, entertaining, unusual experience for the viewer. ""Fur"", her new film directed by Steven Shainberg (""Secretary""), is not the best film she has ever been in and it isn't the worse.

The late 50s. Diane Arbus (Kidman) lives with her husband, Allan (Ty Burrell), and their two daughters, in a large apartment in New York. They have converted part of the apartment into a photography studio and make a handsome living shooting covers for Vogue and ads for her father's (Harris Yulin) fur shops. But Diane is unhappy and feels that her life is unfulfilled. She no longer finds joy helping load her husband's camera, or fixing one of the model's outfits. Allan suggests she take some time off, shoot some photos of her own. One night, she overhears a new neighbor moving in upstairs. Peering out the window, she spots the new tenant, Lionel (Robert Downey Jr.), paying the movers. She is intrigued; Lionel is covered from head to toe in clothing, a crocheted mask covering his face and head. She soon ventures up to his apartment and learns he is covered from head to toe in long hair, fur. Lionel intrigues her and introduces her to a variety of strange people she would never have otherwise met; midgets, giants, people with no arms, Siamese twins, and others you would have to go to the sideshow attractions at a circus to meet, at least during this period. She begins to feel more comfortable around these people, and grows more distant from her husband and children.

""Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus"", directed by Steven Shainberg, is an interesting, highly stylized portrait of perhaps one of the most enigmatic figures in modern art. Very little is known about the photographer; she didn't talk about herself much and there seems to be a cone of silence around her as little has been said by any family member or friend. So Shainberg, and his screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, working from a book by Patricia Bosworth, have fashioned a tale out what they were able to find out and attempt to paint a portrait of the influences that would shape what her photographs would become.

This is an interesting idea and helps to provide some idea of the photographer's life. Lionel is, apparently, completely fictional, and proves as a sort of mentor, introducing her to people and things outside of her comfort zone, taking her out of her upper class New York world and showing her the type of people who would become her subjects.

Kidman's portrayal of Arbus is very quiet. She goes from housewife and studio assistant, confused about her life, to a more adventurous woman, but still confused about her life. As she becomes more familiar with Lionel, and the people who inhabit his world, her eyes open wider, her smile grows, she seems to become alive. Yet, she also realizes she is drawing further and further away from her husband and children. How can she reconcile the two worlds? She can't, and she has to make a decision.

Robert Downey Jr. also plays it quiet. He never speaks above a murmur and it is all but impossible to see his facial expressions throughout, as he is covered with fur. As they grow closer, he becomes more involved in her life, more interested in helping her push her boundaries.

The idea of painting a portrait of an artist, imagining what their influences were, is probably not far from what most artist biopics actually accomplish. How can we know what was going through Picasso's (Anthony Hopkins) head as he painted in ""Surviving Picasso""? How can we know what inspired painter Vermeer (Colin Firth) ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring""? We can't, unless they happened to keep detailed journals, and most artists used the canvas as their journal. So, while ""Surviving Picasso"" and ""The Girl With A Pearl Earring"" don't purport to be biographies of the artist's life, they do try to paint a portrait of these people at work, during specific periods, using real people in their life as characters in the films. ""Fur"" is not all that different. With the exception of Lionel, most of the film appears to be culled from what little detail could be learned about the enigmatic photographer's life. The character of Lionel was created as a passport into her life and her world. There is a significant amount of dramatic license used in both types of films, but in ""Fur"", the license is overt.

Director Shainberg seems to have a lot of fun depicting the oddball look of New York in the 50s. The guests at a party at the Arbus house and studio seem like they are desperate for any moment of fun, desperate for a laugh, everyone of them smoking, because it is the fashionable thing to do. At one point, Allan is composing the models for an ad and we see a look at what the finished ad might look like and it brilliantly evokes the advertising of this age, six almost identical women, each standing behind an ironing board, each wearing the same clothing, but in different primary colors. Then, as Diane becomes more involved in Lionel's world, the dcor has a more hand me down look, as though everything was purchased at a flea market or garage sale.

While the film is interesting to watch, a certain fairy tale quality is pervasive, the reason behind the central relationship is vague and unsatisfying. I get that Diane is intrigued by Lionel, but the reason for the unhappiness with her husband and her marriage is never really explained. She has a breakdown, but why? Late in the film, she spends a significant amount of time shaving Lionel, revealing the man beneath, essentially erasing the very thing she was attracted to in the first place. ""Fur"" can't seem to decide what it wants to say about Diane Arbus' feelings.

And because feelings are such a huge part of the make-up of most artists, ""Fur"" doesn't reveal enough.",1163548800,43,6020,4.747609942638623

2772906,5,B000NO1XG8,"I am a Christian,and never watch any form of nudity unless it is unintendly pops up and I switch to something else. I always found Diane Arbus talent as a photographer coloring outside the lines with her camera,amazing. She found beauty in the people most people turn away from after a peak. I grew up with a uncle more like a brother,who had polio,and we use to carry our brownies around and ask the people who stared at his braces and crutches,""Would you like us to take a picture of him and mail it to you?"" It was the only time we were allowed to be rude as children.  Then as an adult in my 40s I came across Diane Arbus pictures. To me they were just people....and I knew she like my sister and I,understood what a camera could take. So I saw this DVD on Amazon  titled FUR and her name and knew I would buy it .  There are many people who are normal in my mind,that others unlike Diane didn't find so. So in this movie we are invited into her world and what a world it is. The fur is amazing in that you wonder who is under all of that hair,because the eyes are so compelling and his voice is so normal and you quit noticing all of his hair because his eyes and voice are so warm and lovely. There is nudity,but not where you find it sexual,in that she undresses to enter a bath,he is back nude as he is running towards the ocean.  It isn't for children,or even teens because it is for adults,though even some adults sadly,do not know how to not stare or make fun of .But, it is for those who appreciate that all are created equal,even if they do not look like ""me,myself and I"" I loved the bravery of the film for what they say is true. I have read my review to here,,I know that to watch this is not to approve of the brief nudity,but to be grateful Diane Arbus looked at Gods creations and saw what so many refused to, because they were different, God did create all the people that are in this movie  and like God,she considered them as beautiful .

2772922,5,B000NO1XG8,"It's high time this brilliant creative artist's life is remembered for other reasons besides the sudden way it ended.

In the 1970s and 1980s, I talked to many women who said Ms. Arbus was mentally ""sick.""  One was a reference librarian at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in downtown Baltimore.  She and her mother had served in the U.S. military.

When I asked her if female hard rockers who admitted to using hard drugs had mental health issues, she said, ""No.""  That's part of the rock & roll lifestyle.  But photographers should know better than to make stupid decisions.

But Diane Arbus was bothered by the way American magazines of the 1950s, especially women's magazines such as Glamour, seemed to dictate who looked normal and whose behavior was normal.  She had the guts to smash through that dictatorial standard.  (That standard was created by a powerful woman named Diana Vreeland, but few people watched the movie in which an actress played her.  To this day, teens who look through Glamour magazine think you have to be thin and clad in certain clothes in order to be normal.)

Diane Arbus never met Janis Joplin, who was smashing through the notion that Caucasian female singers had to be influenced by other Caucasian female singers.  Neither woman was mentally ill.  The reason they became emotionally devastated was that it's tough to be a pioneer in American culture, especially when the trail you blaze makes a lot of money and becomes the ""main highway"" for imitators.

Nicole Kidman did Diane justice when you consider the difficult job Steven Shainberg had using fake dialogue to explain why the 1950s standard of normalcy inspired a real person to smash it.  Other actors did a great job, but it was the screenplay that allowed them to.

I'm not going to contrast ""Fur"" with Shainberg's ""Secretary"" because the latter is pure fiction.  Viewers' reaction to ""Fur"" should have to do with Diane, not Steven.  He was trying to convey to millions of people how a totally obscure real person who created phony magazine advertisements -- working invisibly behind the scenes for the 1950s propaganda machine -- became inspired to smash through them and it.  The fictional screenplay hangs the inspiration totally on one hairy, ""freaky"" person who happens to be her neighbor.  The real Diane started networking with many ""freaks"" simultaneously, and none of them lived in the apartment building where she and her husband were raising two daughters.  That's okay.  Kidman, thanks to Shainberg, still shows viewers that this woman was looking in the distance at some truth that millions of Americans were missing.  The truth was, ""You don't know who is normal.""",1357948800,,2672,4.941704035874439

2772927,4,B000NO1XG8,"Being one of those few who DID see Secretary, I was completely shocked when I found out this delightful little film was written and directed by the same person. Why, because I found the first film to be a disturbing and completely self-indulgent mess that left me wondering if I had drunk from the wrong bottle. What is equally shocking to me is that Secretary is the more well-known of the two films-especially since this one boasts far more star power than the other (honestly, who is James Spader compared to the great Robert Downey Jr.?), and this film seems to actually have some color in its story. Where the entirety of Secretary's appeal was in its look (gorgeous cinematography), Fur actually pulled me in so far as to make me completely believe in its quirk. I loved this film from the beginning to the end, and while the third act felt a bit unoriginal, there was never that eye-rolling Nicholas Sparks level of banality to turn me off to it.

The film starts out with our heroine, the great-albiet heavily fictionalized- Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman), riding a bus through the countryside, scratching down possible ideas for her photography project. We see from the get-go that Diane is not the typical American photographer, as her first stop is a nudist colony where the rules vary from no staring to no erections. The first scene is indication enough that the film has a few of its buttons undone-enough that the audience is tested for their open-mindedness just as thoroughly as the characters.

The great majority of the film is told in flashback through a minute fraction of Diane's life. It begins with her dressing for a party and fashion show held by her parents in her family's home. She is obviously frustrated and feels supressed by her typical and bland lifestyle, so much so that she quite literally has to open her blouse on the porch to feel she can breathe. We can see from the way everyone around her seems to view her that Diane is a kind of black sheep, only able to tell the truth of her strange desires to her husband, although he in turn finds her peculiar. Diane wants more from life than to be the doting housewife, who contributes something of her own. We do not know what this is until Diane locks eyes with a masked man standing outside her window, the moment from where her adventure begins. Diane is instantly captivated by this mysterious stranger, who incidentally is about to become her new neighbor. Armed with nothing but a polaroid camera, Diane ventures not just up to his apartment, but into a whole new world that exists just inside his door. The man, named Lionel (Robert Downey Jr.), is actually an ex circus freak who wears a mask in public to hide his curious condition. He suffers from a genetic disorder called Hypertrichosis, which causes excessive amounts of hair growth. With a less charismatic leading man, I can see how presenting such a grotesque character could be an instant lip-curler; enough of one to keep the audience out of the story for the duration of the film. However, Downey Jr. gives a tour de force performance, endearing the character of Lionel to such a degree that it seems criminal that it is not one of his more admired roles. As a viewer, you don't quite 'forget' about his appearence, because that is not what is called for. Instead, Downey Jr. brings so much humanity to the character that you actually come to like his strange look as much as Diane does.

Diane and Lionel lock on to each other almost immediately, forming a deep relationship that inevitably leans towards the romantic in the end. However, what sells this romance is that on the surface, it seems to exhibit that dead-horse of a formula we have all seen a million times, but is built on a foundation that is so unusual, it feels completely fresh. Diane opens up to Lionel about her strangeness in a way she has never been able to explain to anyone, including herself. She explains to him her fascination with the things in the world that most turn a blind-eye to: magicians, dwarves, giants, prostitutes, the deformed, even the dead. Lionel, seeing the artist in her that no one including herself does, introduces her to the world of the bizarre. He takes her to visit transvestites, morgues, even a dominatrix, all of which slowly but steadily bring Diane out of her shell and lead her to discover her true abilities. However, the conflict lies in that Diane is likewise becoming alienated from her family, expecially her old-fashioned husband who begins to grow skeptical and jealous of the budding relationship between her and Lionel. As his support of her growing creativity wanes, Diane's ability to seperate herself from Lionel does as well.

Where this film totters is the third act, where it does take a clichd turn that I, for however much I was enjoying it otherwise, couldn't ignore. I won't  spoil it, although it really is not too difficult a conclusion to figure out. I WILL say that it was too safe and predictable an ending that tried to cover itself using some powerful scoring and cheesy melodrama. It could have been a knockout ending to an otherwise great film, which ultimately leads me to give it four stars out of five. The film, if given a chance, is not a disappointment by any means, regardless of the final part of the third act. However, that being said, this film is not one that is targeted for a mainstream audience, and thankfully it was not marketed that way upon its release. What I mean by that is that this film has a particular viewer in mind; a person who keeps an open mind while watching movies and whose opinion of films are not decided by appearences alone. Nicole Kidman is beautiful in this film, even though, while I didn't take points away for this, her choice to whisper a good percentage of her lines got to be distracting at points. The chemistry between her and Robert Downey Jr. is based on so much more than the dialogue, and I was so embursed while watching them together that by the end, I wasn't paying any mind to how they delivered their lines. Overall, this is a beautiful film that while I won't go so far to say shines at an Oscar caliber level, is lovely for what it is and hopefully will be come to be appreciated more than it is in the years to come.",1342396800,,6264,4.614349775784754

2772938,1,B000NO1XG8,"I have no problem with this movie being an ""imaginary portrait."" Diane did live inside her head, and had a very rich imagination. The premise of this movie does have merit. Unfortunately, they missed so many of the truly interesting and brave qualities Arbus had, opting instead to flatten her out into a two-dimensional 50's house wife with a few strange quirks. I find this insulting, it's as if the film maker can't imagine anyone understanding a more complex character. Or they can, but they're trying to appeal to a larger audience (which this movie didn't get anyway).

But that's not the worst reductive work of this film. Allan Arbus, Diane's husband, was integral to her growth as an artist. I'm not saying this to bemoan the film not sticking to facts, but because it leads into the most interesting romantic relationship Diane had in her life: Allan Arbus. Allan and Diane adored each other. She fell in love with him when she was 14! He routinely encouraged her to get out of the house, and knew full well that she was sleeping with other people. According to the book this movie was based on, the two of them talked about it OPENLY in the 50's with friends! This is unique even today.

2772941,4,B000NO1XG8,"I did not know what to expect, though I had an old interest in Diane Arbus from my earliest student days.  So I was just curious.

Once I started the film, I was transported both to the late 1950s America and to an original mind as it was about to burst its bounds.  According to the film, Arbus is stifled by the 50s middle class respectability thing, suffocated by her controlling parents, and bored in a conventional marriage with a good if self-absorbed man.  There is love and stability in her life, but something yearns for more without any idea of what that might be.  Then she spies a masked man moving into the apartment at the top of the building, who becomes her mentor to an underworld of transvestites, giants, dwarfs, gimps, druggies, and combinations thereof - she observes them, parties with them, and eventually sleeps with them, essentially leaving her family for what they perceived as freaks.  If this sounds a bit outlandish, it is, but the astounding thing is that the filmmaker pulls it off as completely believable and with a unique magic that is its own.  In my view, there are two reasons for this.

First, there is the charisma of her svengali, the masked man, Downey.  He is absolutely amazing, with an otherworldly beauty and charm that is disguised in hair and bizarre behavior.  It completely took me in, with the astounding imagery of the set designs, how his ideas made sense more through demonstration than any analysis could offer, and how he seduces Arbus with patience and sympathy.  I was swept into his milieu and intuitively accepted whatever he did.  The outcasts come off as sympathetic and very human. looking for intimacy and fun in their own ways.

Second, there is the personal, very interior journey of Arbus.  This comes closest to cliche, the artist waiting to be unbound in order to do something no one else can. Nonetheless, Kidman is excellent as you feel her yearning, sense her talent and feral passion beneath the respectable if depressed surface.  There is a lot of symbolic imagery, such as the unlocking of the door as she fantasizes and remembers her mother's admonitions to ignore what she sees, that at times gets a bit heavy, however well it fits into the gem that the film is striving to create.  The apotheosis of it all is perhaps the longest shaving scene in the history of American cinema, more sensual than any of the explicit sex scenes.

Recommended warmly.  This is a unique vision as fully realized by the director of Secretary.  It is, of course, completely fictional - there is little known of her life at that time and the masked man is an invention.

Such a beautiful creature to behold, beyond the mundane, run-of-the-mill human, and so expressive and talented with the use of minimal movements, she is choosing her roles as she should these days--worthy of her talent and her creativity.

As for Downey--another exquisite talent.
So glad to see him productive and well and healthy these days.

  Do you remember carnivales? The places where you could see people different, but unquie in a marvelous way? This movie explores this World, but so much more.
  It is an awakening of a young Woman, talented & special in Her own life. She is a daughter of wealthy but uptight Parents, who think that She is odd in some of Her ways. Her husband marries Her for wealth & a lively hood as a photo artist, but She is the special one with the camera.
  She is set free by an upstairs neighbor, played beautifully by Robert Downey Jr. His depth of character is deep, and pulls you in this World of delightful people & ideas. Nicole Kidman is excellent as the young Woman, braking free of the ties that bind her.
  Take a chance on this movie, you won't be disappointed.

2772957,4,B000NO1XG8,"A very poignantly told tale of this fascinating woman called Diane Arbus.  The movie starts off with Dian Arbus 'trapped' in her very ordinary middle-class life with her husband and two kids.  Her inner artist is just dying to break free and is finally able to do that by the meeting of a strange neighbour, Lionel.  By her friendship with Lionel, Diane is introduced to an entirely different world and she is able to discover her true self and become the artist she was meant to be - or so as the story is told in the film.

What fascinated me was how this whole story is told in the movie.  The intricate details of the camera work made the characters' every move, every look, every thought so purposeful and so intense.  A very rare form of story-telling in the movie.  There were many symbolic moments which, again, were so beautifully put on screen.

Nicole Kidman proves herself, yet again, in this movie.  She is the masterpiece that she creates in her craft.  I really think she is in her own league in her acting.  She has allowed the audience to feel everything that Diane was feeling through her.  Robert Downey Jr is another magnificent actor.  He has a unique quality to him that no other actor has and this movie just proves him to be one of the greats.  He spends most of this movie covered in 'fur' but his erotic charm exudes out of his eyes - what a performance!

I knocked one of the stars off because this movie definitely is not a conventional film that I would recommend to any movie-goer.  I recommend it to people who are looking for an unconventional movie experience.",1240272000,,1593,4.479166666666667

2772959,1,B000NO1XG8,"I waited quite a while to see this movie on cable, mostly because I adore
Robert Downy Jr. Restoration is one of my favorite films. What a total
disappointment. Kidman's role choices are pretty predictable, so I knew
the story would involve forbidden love and tragedy in some shape or form
and that given her tendency for one-note performances, there would be a
lot of pouting, brow-knitting, and plenty of shallow breathing. According to
those intimately acquainted with Diane Arbus and her work, it also seems
ridiculous to have chosen a tall, gangly Australian woman with strawberry
blond hair to portray a small Jewish woman with dark features. Janine
Garofolo or Jennifer Conolly would have been more appropriate choices.

I was less prepared for Downey's lackluster performance, which was utterly
void of passion. He seemed exhausted throughout the film, and looked old
and tired without the fur veil. Instead of haunting and mysterious, his
character betrayed a boredom and lack of depth that ran counter to his life
and circumstances. Furthermore, there was absolutely no chemistry between
these two actors! The scene where Kidman shaved off his hair had the potential
for eroticism, but the lack of passion between the two resulted in a paint-by
numbers sex scene and a cheeseball ""tragic"" ending. In sum, neither actor's
performance lived up to the mystery and complexity of the characters they set
out to portray. The  finest performance in the film was given by the gentleman
playing Arbus's husband. A virtual  unknown, his portrayel was raw and inspired
in comparison to the banal acting of his illustrious counterparts.

In addition to the poor acting, the premise of the story was seriously flawed.
The thesis: ""true artists"" must sacrifice everthing for their ""art,"" even if it's their
home, husband and children. If that's the case, why didn't the film choose
to portray Arbus as the dark, tortured individual that she truly was? The
director's way out of this dilemma was to produce a self-conscious piece of
drivel that advances style over substance and banality over true art. Imaginary
indeed. Hopefully some day another film maker will come along and not only
present a truer picture of Diane Arbus, but provide a unique and visionary window
into the mystery...and misery...that pervaded her life.",1232755200,4,2320,5.113456464379947

2772961,5,B000NO1XG8,"I rarely go to the movies nowadays: It would seem that Hollywood delivers only remakes of old movies or old stupid shows or cartoons.  Hollywood writers seem to be doomed to adapt stuff that has already been written. What happened to creativity?

It is certainly not the case with this film. It caught my attention from the start. Set in the repressive 1950's, it tells the story of a frustrated photographer victim of her castrating parents. Her main activity in life is to assist her photographer husband during fashion photo shoots and to take care of her children. Of course this is not enough for her: She is an original, a true artist.

Everything changes when a man with hypertrichosis moves into her apartment building. They become friends as she is introduced into the vibrant underground world of ""Freaks"". While Nicole Kidman's former husband Tom Cruise needs to wear fat suits in stupid comedies in order to attempt to revive his career, Nicole Kidman  delivers one of her best performances yet: She is poignant, vulnerable but at the same time her portrayal as a frustrated talent is very believable.

Robert Downy JR. is also quite impressive in his role, he manages to be charismatic even when covered in all that fur. One can understand why Diane Arbus falls in love with him. As a whole, this picture invites us to explore and accept new concepts of beauty. It also explore the depth of human relationships. It's an original story, and a very pleasant surprise.

I read Diane (prounced Dee-Ann) Arbus' biography many years ago.  Her photographs of ""unusual people"" have haunted me for years.  She was a genius, but a tortured person.  She committed suicide by slashing her wrists while she was in her bath tub.  She bled to death, and her body was not discovered for several days.

When I first heard about ""Fur"" I thought, how could Nicole Kidman portray a short Jewish woman?  Arbus was only 5 feet tall, Kidman almost 6 feet tall.  But Kidman nailed it.  She made me believe that she was Diane Arbus.  Her chemistry with Downey was remarkable.  Fabulous acting from these two marvelous actors.  So glad to see Downey getting his ""act"" together after his miserable drug addictions.  Bravo Downey!  You were amazing, how I just loved you in this role.

This movie reminds me of the tv series ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Vincent and Catherine.  Love knows no boundaries.  And the scene where Kidman shaves her lover, how beautiful! Such total love.

Arbus's pictures always made me feel like you shouldn't be so intrigued by them but for some reason you could just stare at them all day and that is how the movie pulled me as well. The plot is also rounded out nicely by the story of Arbus finding her true self and breaking away from the life she chose when she was trying to pretend to fit in with what was considered normal.

2772965,4,B000NO1XG8,"After reading the other reviews, it seems to me that people write to their tastes; some love Kidman, some don't, etc. Their established tastes, by and large, make up their enjoyment (or not) of anything be it film, music or literature.

So, that being said, my ten cents:
#1.  I'd never heard of Diane Arbus before picking up this film.
#2.  I picked it up for Robert Downey Jr. (Established Taste).
#3.  Guess what? There are no words for how I feel about his performance that could convey my depth of feeling. (picks up jaw and several other body parts from floor)
#4.  I think I finally appreciate Nicole Kidman. I definitely appreciate her position.
#5.  I actually felt sorry for Diane's husband but he didn't deserve her. Her talent in ""helping"" with his photographic work made him. He couldn't do it without her - not like he did.
#6.  Cheesy? Depends on how hardened your heart is and, tell me, have YOU ever been in love? And then lost that person? As I cried I totally understood how she felt when she wore his fur coat he made for her and breathed in the air from the raft he inflated. Oddly enough, this is the only part of the film I couldn't believe in. Lionel was having trouble climbing the stairs to his apartment by the end there so if his lungs were as bad as all that, HOW could he blow up anything?
#7.  This is a visual feast. The colors, the fashions, the hair!
#8.  It is disturbing in places. Do Not Watch if nudity disturbs you at all. Really. Don't.
#9.  Also, do not watch if suicide bothers you. Or did he? Whatever, Lionel dies happy - or as happy as someone with a life like his could be.
#10. As much as I liked this film I have to agree the ending fell short. It felt unfinished. For a period of time where there was so much rich drama you end up feeling like ""what happened""? I feel they should have ended it on the beach. The next bunch of scenes should have been the main movie with all the rest done as flashbacks.

Oh well...if you are a fan of RDJ or Kidman, this movie will rock your world. If you are a fan of Diane Arbus, it is a damn fine ""What If"".

2772966,4,B000NO1XG8,"Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus is a brilliant freak show. From the director who brought us Secretary, Steven Shainberg, he follows through amazingly with his genre of weird, kinky, but yet so interesting tales of love, fetishes, and a bit of betrayal. Nicole Kidman plays a character like we've never seen her play before as well as Robert Downey Jr. I applaud Shainberg for having the guts to do these kind of films that make actors work and think outside of their comfort zone, making the awkward moments and uncertainty feel so true. Downey Jr. an otherwise ""handsome"" actor plays a character with a disease called hypertrichosis, which has made him have excessive hair growth. Although you can't see his face throughout 3/4 of the film he still manages to make you feel a bit attracted toward him, as Kidman's character Diane Arbus can vouch as she does fall in love with him despite the disease. Though Arbus somewhat abandonds her ""normal"" family for Lionel (Downey Jr.) and interesting group of circus friends you still cannot see the husband and two children she leaves behind as the protagonists. In any other case you may feel for them and think harshly of Arbus for leaving but you don't you keep rooting for her no matter what happens. When it comes down to the end of the film and the secret of Lionel's inevitable death is revealed you're absolutely heart broken while watching Arbus try to hold on to him as long as she can sucking his breath out of an inflatable water toy he had blown up before he washes out to sea.

This was an interesting concept, but the screenplay is weak, and the characters and story are both underdeveloped. There is no depth here at all. You find yourself simply apathetic towards the people on the screen, and this is never good when the film under question is supposed to be a character study.

There are a few things to admire in this film, but you just can't get past the feeling that much more could have been done to make this a better film. Robert Downey Jr tries his best to deliver a strong performance, and he does a decent job here...even though he is covered with hair from head to toe through half of the film.

2772970,3,B000NO1XG8,"Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus is a highly fictionalized account of what inspired the American photographer to take pictures of unconventional subjects such as giants, trannies, dwarves, and prostitutes.  It doesn't get into her divorce, her period of accomplishments as a photographer, or even her suicide.  The period the film covers is while she is married and the film's primary function seems to be focused on exploring what could've compelled Diane to take these often bizarre pictures.  So fundamentally I guess I had a problem with the film's story right off the bat, as I can't really understand why it requires so much hoopla to find inspiration in these unique subjects.  But maybe I'm just an unconventional guy.

Anyway, Diane is played by Nicole Kidman, who is both a great actress and very good-looking so if you like Kidman then this is at the very least worth seeing once.  Diane is portrayed as a conservative housewife eager to break out of her shell.  In real life Arbus was married very young so I found this aspect of the film fairly convincing considering this is an ""imaginary"" biopic.  A new neighbor named Lionel (Robert Downey, Jr.) moves in upstairs and he suffers from hypertrichosis or werewolf syndrome and all I could think of was Lionel, the feline leader of the Thunder Cats.  Basically, he is covered in hair.  Arbus is almost instantly fascinated and feels compelled to meet him and, eventually, take his portrait.  Director Steven Shainberg does well with what he has but not enough to overcome the film's flaws.

He can't be blamed.

The problems I have other than the concept which, although crucial could've been partially forgiven in different circumstances, are the screenplay and the performance of Robert Downey, Jr., which of course overlap each other because Downey, Jr.'s dialogue is just far too sappy and dramatic at times.  Downey, Jr. can be a good actor in the right setting but he brings a little too much of himself into each role and it definitely doesn't work for me here.  The screenplay is too heavy-handed at times and is at the very least responsible for drawing more than half a dozen groans from my living room the other night.

Anyway, mediocre rating from this viewer but probably leans more to the ""not recommended"" end.  Perhaps it gains a star for providing a few fleeting glimpses of Kidman's delightful bare backside.",1207180800,7,2621,5.214797136038186

Well it could be a film with a tighter script...unfortunately that's not this film.

It tries to realize her by digging into her essence, what made her who she was through metaphor instead of relying on cold hard facts. So who was Diane Arbus? I'm still not sure. Not to say that it's a bad film as it does have its redeeming qualities such as Downey's performance but it has trouble selling Arbus' relationship and subsequent affair with his character Lionel. Get it Lionel? Lion? A lion is hairy like him? Fur? ...whatever.

So he's a freak and his friends are freaks, so what? Show us the freakiness! Let's experience what it is like to be one, have her explore what that humiliation is like and what it's like to be a part of that fraternity! There are obvious attempts to show the tragic side to Lionel such as the shaving scene and her portrait of him but the attempt is shallow. Oddly enough the tragedy in the film was not her confines (as
claustrophobic as it was) or Lionel's affliction but what the
husband was going through. Unfortunately they dropped the ball exploring that further.

I know it wasn't a traditional biopic as this was a re-imagining of her life but it could have been more interesting. So what went wrong? What went wrong was that there was too much attention paid to how pretty every frame of the film was and little attention to fleshing out the characters, realizing this interesting concept and sticking to a direction. And for those who have the terrible habit of claiming that those who did not enjoy this film did not ""get it"" all I have to say is get over yourselves. It's far from being an art house film that took any risks.

Most of that half hour was spent on closeups of Kidman's face fixed in the one expression she uses to indicate any kind of emotion: lips slightly parted, brows drawn together, signifying worry? angst? gas?

The script doesn't help us find out. It tries to be artsy and show Arbus' fascination with the freaks of the world. I know this from the description on the DVD case but I'd never get a clue from the movie itself. It oozes S L O W L Y along without much dialog or exposition. For instance, one scene has Kidman climbing a staircase for a full 4 minutes (Yes, I timed it). There's no dialog or visual exposition, just closeups of the Single Kidman Expression indicating something significant is happening to her character, and shots of her ascending the staircase.

There are also shots of freaks intended to be as creepy as possible. In the half hour I survived, there were several shots of an armless woman dusting and drinking tea with her feet, and Kidman's werewolf-like neighbor. These were included without any value to the story or character. So the movie's not just agonizingly boring, it will have you going 'EEEYYEWWWW' a lot, too.

According to Wikipedia, eventually it was picked up and produced and the Aperture monograph has since been reprinted 12 times, selling more than 100,000 copies. Diane Arbus was clearly a woman who saw the carnival and beauty of life.

The remarkable tribute was made through a journey a la Cocteau: Once Diane (in her 35) decided to get into that apartment - or the mythic step - (Cocteau would employ a mirror in Orpheus) , she will experience the otherness of the reality, when she meets this sensitive human being (a sincere homage to The beauty and the beast)  and she decides to assemble a parallel and complementary world, that divided the reality in two well sections, although both be incompatible. Her fervent desire to embrace the otherness of the real world including other features (another homage to that famous film of Ted browning. Freaks) make of this film a true surrealistic journey, an urban fable , an alluring melting of poetic imagination and delirious human warmth, that made me to congratulate this risky proposal not precisely in vogue in those days.

On one hand it raises the interesting notion that to be a great artist one needs to break free from one's mundane surroundings. On the other hand it has the ability to bask in its own notion of a rather cheesy love story.

Nicole Kidman plays Diane Arbus at the turning point of her life. She is a dutiful wife and photography assistant to her husband Allan (Ty Burrell)but she has a wild streak just below the surface that is ready to emerge at any time. Into her existence comes Lionel Sweeney (Rober Downey, Jr.) a new upstairs neighbor who is covered in hair. Instantly facinated Diane decides to take his portrait.

The film follows her as she enters his world. We are introduced to the people who will be the subjects of her later photographs. We see her break away from her world as she had lived it and enter upon a new life as an artist.

This premise is great and Shainberg brings an Alice in Wonderland feel to the transformation. Where the story falters however is that it turns into a rather conventional love story between Diane and Lionel.

The film was very well shot by Bill Pope and convincingly takes its viewers to 1958 New York. then a world of wonders for Ms. Arbus. It must be remembered that this is an imaginary portrait so those looking for information about the photographers life may well be disappointed.

It was intended to answer the question of what pushed Arbus (Nicole Kidman) to break from her traditional role of wife, mother, and photographer's assistant and commence taking photographs of freaks, midgets, giants, albinos, twins, sex workers, corpses, the mentally challenged, etc, etc.  The character of Lionel Sweeney (Robert Downey Jr.) serves to give Arbus that push by leading her into his dream-like world of circus performers and human oddities, forming an intensely erotic bond with her that awakens the artist within and allows her to become the photographer that she eventually became.  The film has been criticized for delving too far into the tragic and the romantic and for not staying true to the biographical story of Arbus's life, but at the end of the day, who cares?  I loved it.  I was able to easily see what the filmmakers were trying to do and it made sense to me.  I loved the fact that the film took Arbus's story in a completely different direction by attempting to answer the unanswerable, and very creatively at that.  I would say that it helps to know something about Diane Arbus and her life prior to viewing the film (I own two or three books of Arbus's photography and I have read the Patricia Bosworth biography, and both greatly contributed to my understanding of the film).  ""Fur"" should appeal to viewers who like fantasy-themed films and who do not mind certain liberties being taken with factual information.",1185753600,4,1764,4.889261744966443
2772981,1,B000NO1XG8,"This film made me sad at the squandered opportunity to have shared with a new generation and a larger audience an immense American talent in visual art through the medium of photography. Rather than grapple with a complex woman in a transitional cultural time for both women and the arts, we are given this water color of a woman, dropped in the middle of a Tod Browning carnival of 'Freaks,' trivializing Arbus' groundbreaking sense of vision and boundary-challenging subject matter. What a terrific actress like Nicole Kidman could have done in bringing us the raw, authentic artist and woman had she not signed on to this 'imaginary portrait.'",1185321600,16,646,4.9907407407407405
2772982,2,B000NO1XG8,"It is apparent why Diane wants to escape from her life.  Her husband is nice enough, but her parents would drive anyone over the edge.  They are continually degrading her, and seem to wish that their son-in-law were their son, providing them with a more acceptable daughter.

The theme of the movie is the eponymous fur.  This is her parent's business, her husband's business, and she wears fur even when it is not appropriate.  So who does she find . . someone who is covered in hair, or fur, although his problem is genetic, not choice.  Through Lionel, she finds a world of strangeness, perhaps in contrast to the closeness and familiarity of fur (or hair).

Diane Arbus had a sad life, which, as is well known, ended in suicide.  Her sadness can be seen in her photographs, which were not presented in the movie.  But even when she smiles in the movie, a dark patina covers her face.

As unattractive as she tries to appears, Nicole Kidman cannot hid the fact of her beauty . . which is in contrast to the part she is playing.

This is a very strange movie, but watching Nicole Kidman is always a pleasure.",1185321600,6,1110,4.472636815920398

2772984,1,B000NO1XG8,"I have been a long time fan of Diane Arbus's art, having been exposed to her quirky yet meaningful photos while I was still in high school. This awful, pretentious and over-reaching attempt at making an ""Art Film"" loosely (VERY loosely) based on her life fails at every turn. The film is directed in an extremely self-conscious manner, attempting to create ""perfect"" balance as if composing still life or portrait photographs. Everything is saturated and exaggerated, with even the soundtrack consisting of listless, sotto voce chamber jazz devolving into random ambient notes as the prurient aspects of the film build to an anti-climax. The actors whisper their way through an awful script, begging the question: does Nicole Kidman simply take ANY movie offer these days? Not that she is a great actor, but in the case of ""Fur"", her character is so shallow, transparent, and two-dimensional that one wonders whether she takes films intending to just be Nicole Kidman as she appeared in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" - another empty, emotionally vacant role for her.
  I won't even dwell on the utter distortion of facts that are made in this film in regards to the real Diane Arbus - EVERYTHING is wrong, from the time period of the film's setting to the gross exaggerations of Arbus's artistic muse. Truly an insult to Diane Arbus and her artistic legacy.",1184198400,19,1344,4.916299559471366
2772985,4,B000NO1XG8,"This movie walks a fine line between biography and fantasy and I must say the final product succeeds as a strange amalgamation of the imaginary and the real. The fantasy part provides the drama for the movie and the biographic part peaks my interests in Diane Arbus and her art. The film uses the fairy tale like narrative (ala Beauty and the Beast) to cunningly explain how Diane was led to break out of her conventional role as a housewife and as an under-appreciated assitant to her husband. There are some accurate biographical details here: e.g. that it was her husband who gave her her first camera and it was him who encouraged her to experiment with it. The couples at the nudist camp scenes which frame the story come from one of the more shocking works of Diane Arbus and the circus like entourage of Lionel explains how Diane got into using freaks and deformed people (dwarf, girl with no arms, siames twin) as subject (""Most people go through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They've already passed their test in life. They're aristocrats"" - Diane Arbus). The director also did a fine job in contrasting the bohemian surrounding in Lionel's ""dwelling"" versus the modern, meticulously clean apartment of Diane and her husband. And the fact that they are in the same house reflects the dichotomy of the Diane's psychological mind set. Diane is ultimately freed from her conventional role through a sea change (an allusion to Shakespeare's Tempest?) and she's freed sexually also (as constrsted by the position she was forced into compromise with her husband and her preferred position with Lionel).

Overall this is a satisfying movie experience especially with introducing me to Diane Arbus, the photographer and her work. To quote Diane one more time: ""I always thought of photography as a naughty thing to do - that was one of my favorite things about it, and when I first did it, I felt very perverse."" Doesn't that ""neatly"" summarizes this film too - a little bit naughty, a little bit perverse?",1183075200,2,2064,4.847025495750708

Horrible, just horrible and I would even (dare I say) like a refund.  I am embarrassed to admit that I even purchased this piece of garbage.  It was merely a flitting tale of Beauty and the Beast.  A shambles of a story.  Shame on all of you. Shame shame shame...",1182816000,9,542,4.095238095238095
2772987,3,B000NO1XG8,"Steven Shainberg's follow-up to utterly unique and fascinating ""twisted"" romance ""Secretary"" starts with an intriguing blend of reality and fairy tale based on the life of photographer Diane Arbus played by Nicole Kidman. Diane is introduced as ordinary mother and housewife of wealthy family living in a clean and expensive New York apartment, but she is gradually attracted to a mysterious, ailing neighbor Lionel (Robert Downey Jr. with special make-up) who happens to move in the same building. As the story unfolds with an undercurrent motif of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Beauty and the Beast,"" Diane begins taking photos, which eventually becomes her profession, or life.

As the film says in its introduction, ""Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus"" is not meant to be taken as biography. That's not a bad thing, and actually the first half of the film is engaging with cryptic words and apparently strange behaviors of Lionel, which remind of the characters Alice encounters in Wonderland. The images have mood, sometimes creepy, and the film's point is also clear.

Then, somewhere in the middle, ""Fur"" starts to lose uniqueness and becomes more ordinary and lifeless. Perhaps that is because the film has more familiar, melodramatic elements that we can see in other Hollywood films, or perhaps because the film's initial premise is stretched too much beyond its limit. Acting of Nicole Kidman and Robert Downey Jr. is good, often moving, but not in the same way as more daring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.

""Fur"" has fantastic visuals and wonderful production designs, but for all such scenes as nudist club its initially interesting theme is finally lost among the story's conventions. ""Fur"" remains somehow engaging throughout, but for those who have been waiting for the next film after edgy and surprising ""Secretary"" like me, it is still a little disappointing.",1182038400,5,1892,5.176470588235294

2772989,2,B000NO1XG8,"First of all, why make a film that is an ""imaginary portrait"" of Diane Arbus?  It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over.  Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too.  I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough.",1180915200,6,376,4.936507936507937
2772990,4,B000NO1XG8,"As the real-life Diane Arbus once said, ""A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know."" From one of the Steves - no, not Speilberg or Soderbergh - the other one: Shainberg, comes a hauntingly romantic non-biographical biography of Diane Arbus that has been over a decade in the making that addresses just that idea. Fur was written based on the first portrait that Arbus ever made, and the possible back story to that portrait.

Nicole Kidman has had an interesting career filled with everything from major Hollywood films to low budget experimental films. With a $16.8 million budget, this one falls somewhere in between. In Fur, Kidman is Diane Arbus, a stifled upper middle-class woman who just wants to ""let her freak flag fly"" as some might say. Arbus works with her husband in his studio, assisting him on various advertising photo shoots, but she can't help feeling a little repressed and bored. Then a new neighbor moves into the building.

Lionel Sweeney, Robert Downey Jr. in a role where his face is covered for almost the entire film, is an intriguing, seductive, real-life freak, with hair covering his entire body. As Arbus and Sweeney begin to spend more and more time together, gaining intimate knowledge of each other, on the pretext of her making a portrait of him, a relationship grows.

Fur is an exceptionally well-produced film. Criminally underused production designer Amy Danger goes above and beyond the call of duty creating eclectic and striking sets for the film. Lionel's apartment exudes so much energy, it's like a character in itself.

The film may feel a little slow at times, overall it pushes right ahead and Nicole Kidman is it's driving force. In her quiet portrayal of Diane Arbus Kidman shows that no matter how off-beat the content of a film may be, she will dedicate herself to the film.

Although Fur seems to have been a complete flop financially, taking in only $221,000 theatrically, it's a visual masterpiece and a moving film to watch, though it's clearly not a film that everyone will enjoy.",1180310400,8,2075,4.833802816901408
2772991,5,B000NO1XG8,"This jewel of a film is a gem one takes out and regards from time to time for its beauty and the lessons it imparts.  I couldn't look away. What a beautiful treasure.

It's not a biopic of Diane Arbus, but instead a fantastic musing on a possibility; a possibility that the viewer will understand if she image-googles `Diane Arbus' and looks at her photographic portaits of those who don't quite fit the mold. The director absolutely got it spot-on. What a lovely inspired dream.

The plot: Diane, cocooned in her husband's bland portrait photography studio and her mid-twentieth century June Cleaver lifestyle, has her restless mind awakened by the arrival of a mysterious stranger who moves in to the flat upstairs. As she creeps up the stairs and passes through the heavy door to meet him and his entourage of society's outcasts, she herself is reborn to her original self and leaves the world of her young adulthood to fulfill her artistic destiny.

What unfolds is a beautiful morality tale of what it means to have a soul that lives outside of societal convention.  How can one be true to one's art and still navigate the halls our culture places us in?  How can one maintain integrity and control when one is dealt uncontrollable difficulties and challenges?  And how does one provide unconditional love when the object of ones affections cannot be tethered? The Diane character is so starved for a world outside her own, you can see her salivate as she takes some marked risks in order to experience something different. Her passion will be recognized by those viewers who themselves have experienced such conflicted emotion. Kidman and Downey capture it perfectly.

The cinematography is beyond incredible, and redolent with symbolism involving doors, stairs, colors, and camera angles.  The most obvious symbol of all, hair, weaves throughout the film in the most incredible manner. Diane's father is a furrier.  Messages come to her via drains clogged with hair. The stranger is indeed the hirsute Beast. At the film's crisis, Diane is literally wearing a coat of the stranger's hair. And she emerges from her rebirth naked in a colony of nudists, ready to tell her secrets to an audience of people who, because they too are different, will listen with interest instead of revulsion.  The ending is perfect. We could all benefit from being liberated from that which cloaks us from our true selves.

Be warned.  This film is not for everyone. In fact it's not for most people. There's a reason it didn't score at the box office. It's for the rest of us. If you know and are intrigued by Diane Arbus' work, or by the artistic life itself, then you will enjoy this cinematic bon bon immensely.",1180224000,7,2701,4.82034632034632

A little explanation of who she was and how she ended up would have been nice, but without that, it was a very boring and yet somehow unsettling movie!  Extremely slow as well, and a waste of the talents of these two actors.",1179792000,10,515,3.970873786407767
2772993,3,B000NO1XG8,"Fur is an interesting film, a bit slow as most of the critical action is happening within Diane Arbus' head.  It's very hard to show the inner working of someone's thought process, but Nicole Kidman gives an edgy performance as the woman pulled in a direction that breaks the mold of safe homemaker, wife & mother from the 1950s.

The revelation for me was the breathtaking performance of Ty Burrell.  He was in ""Black Hawk Down"" but has never been on my radar screen as an actor.  The obvious care & love he has for his wife as he watches her drift farther and farther away from him is excellently played.  In the scene at the birthday party where he gives his toast, his eyes literally ache with emotion as he declares how much he loves his wife in front of a crowd of guests.  It is the star performance of the film.

The other amazing cameo has to be Boris McGiver as Jack Henry @ the nudist colony.  If ever an actor showed that he was willing to do whatever it takes, he fearlessly shows all of his assets while cracking jokes.  McGiver has previously appeared in ""The Pink Panther"" & 6 episodes of ""The Wire.""  Marceline Hugot as his wife Tippa Henry also bravely goes where few heavy-set women would care to be seen in total.

Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as the hairy upstairs neighbor Lionel Sweeney.  Although I understood the plot point, I never really got what attracted Diane to Lionel.  Was it pity?  Danger? Oddity?  Love?  So this key relationship didn't work as well for me in the film.

Jane Alexander does a journeyman's job in her cameo as Diane's mother, socialite Gertrude Nemerov.

Other than the peep show appeal, this film is a very interesting albeit slow-moving character study.  Nicole Kidman is well worth watching.  Enjoy!",1179792000,11,1758,4.538216560509555

8179782,5,B000NO1XG8,"If I hear one more wanna-be-critic trash this movie for not being authentic, I'll scream. I'm so sick to death of people writing this off as a ""bored housewife"" flick (oh and it's 'bored', as in ""lacks interest"", not 'board' as in ""stiff as""). Yes, this was fictional. But some points - whether pure speculation or hearsay - were factual. She did, in fact, marry her high school sweetheart and have two children. Diane Arbus was an artist, and as such, would have quite possibly felt trapped in her marriage by the time she hit her late 20's/early 30's. We know she felt stifled, having worked in commercial photography with her husband while fulfulling the 50's expectation of being a happy homemaker. Why is it that women - who typically don't realize who they are until well into their 30's - are simply written off as ""bored housewives"" when they become justifiably restless? We had a whole generation of women who married too early and had families, just to fit some preconceived societal mold. Fortunately for the art world, Diane Arbus was able to break out of hers. Imagine the contributions to the arts and sciences had more women of her generation done the same.

Anyway, this is an attempt to ficticiously define the spark that took Diane down the rabbit hole that lead her to the subject matter for which she became synonymous. Both Kidman and Downey give remarkably believable performances. Anyone familiar with Downey performances knows a certain amount of snarkiness permeates all the roles he plays, and this is no exception. But there's an amazing vunerability with this particular character that I found suprisingly refreshing. Visually, the entire movie was a treat for the eyes, and the sets were nothing short of amazing. Worth the watch, and perhaps even a repeat visit.",1517529600,,1792,4.8754098360655735
