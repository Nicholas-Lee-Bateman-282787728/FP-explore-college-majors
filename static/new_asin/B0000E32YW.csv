1933349,5,B0000E32YW,"Collin Raye in top form.

A pity most songs not complete versions, but it's non-stop and a must for all Collin Raye fans.

Good value for money.

Don't bother with the CD just get this.",1094774400,6,185,4.228571428571429
1933350,5,B0000E32YW,"Willie has been recording since the '50s. Here's a chance to see Willie performing at home in Texas. Willie is very underrated as a lead guitarist, and here you'll get to see Willie demonstrating his chops on ""Trigger,"" his old guitar. This DVD has every classic Willie Nelson song you could hope to hear. The DVD has DTS sound, and the ""bonus"" interviews are interesting as band members recount their life on the road. This is essential Texas country music.",1088985600,22,458,4.7375
1933351,5,B0000E32YW,"Here is willie and the band doing what they do best. Every time you see Willie live, you always see his songs in a new light, Willie connects with the audience and performs for the moment. In this concert, Willie is the only lead guitarist (Jackie King was away) and it is great to hear his unique sound throughout the whole concert. This DVD is for the true Willie fan, true fans love to see Willie perform his songs differently every night. Willie is at home here performing in Texas. If you have seen Willie's Amsterdam DVD from 2000, this is a great update to see him 3 years later. I saw Willie in November 2003 and this DVD is not far from what I experienced actually being there. It is also great to see the extra footage and interviews.",1085443200,23,744,4.321428571428571

1933413,5,B0000E32YW,I bought this DVD for my husband.  He likes it very much.  He really likes Asleep at the Wheel.  This band has been together for a long time and their music and vocals are very tight.  My husband is enjoying the DVD.,1483920000,,216,4.071428571428571

1933416,1,B0000E32YW,"Amazon has messed up with the listing of this.  I thought I was ordering separate full concerts by Asleep at the Wheel and then Willie Nelson at Billy Bob's.
Instead the DVD shown in the image is a SAMPLER of one song by each and other performers, but mostly ads for other DVDs.
I will just give them away to the Goodwill.",1466294400,,322,4.193548387096774

1933443,5,B0000E32YW,I'm a little biased because my son is the lead guitarist on the video.  But the production of this video was well done and it is a good representation of what one will witness when he sees the Charlie Robison Band live.,1374192000,,219,4.214285714285714
1933444,5,B0000E32YW,This is a wonderful disk its country music with a twist this is a terrific band I love the song selection the song I love amerilio by morning was as good as George strait all the songs were really good this is a disk for fans and is highly recommended  its worth  it if you don't know about them to give it a try.,1367798400,,313,3.875
1933445,5,B0000E32YW,"Our favorite western swing band - we will travel 1000 miles to see them perform in person,  the best band around keeping the Bob Wills tradition alive!",1365292800,,151,4.592592592592593

I would buy anything that has his name on it.",1357430400,,96,3.619047619047619
1933447,5,B0000E32YW,To the person who wrote that Willie and his band seemed tired. Yes he may seem tired on this D.V.D. but you must remember he's 77 now. I hope I can be as good when I reach his age. I can understand what you are saying as he has slowed down a bit but he is still good. I really dread the day he goes to the big gig in the sky. Then we will have to rely on discs like this to get our Willie fix. I absolutely love this performance as it typifies the man with all his attributes and failings.,1351036800,,489,3.7572815533980584
1933448,5,B0000E32YW,"I've wanted one of their DVDs for a long time, and now I finally have it.
I never really got into Western Swing, although there is not a thing wrong with it - it just seemed to be a sort of a strange hybrid - big band swing, combined with country music.
Maybe it's an acquired taste.
Anyway, maybe after I have watched this for awhille, I'll grow to really dig it.
I actually do sort of like it now, it just doesn't get me as much as, say, Merle Haggard or Gene Watson.
But Bob Wills was a hoot! He was truly one-of-a-kind, and this music is sort of a throwback to his stuff, if not a direct copy.",1338163200,2,597,3.9833333333333334
1933449,4,B0000E32YW,This video is a great one  western swing music and country mix So crank up the tunes on your surround and enjoy,1283212800,,111,4.045454545454546
1933450,2,B0000E32YW,"I can't go down to 1 star because it's Willie, but what's really disappointing is that the setlist is so awesome, however Willie simply refuses to sing and instead ""talks"" the lyrics like others have stated.  I would recommend the Willie and Ray Charles dvd instead of this one.",1257465600,,278,4.673469387755102
1933490,5,B0000E32YW,"He's a little older now than when this was shot in 2004, but it's true to the great show Collin still puts on - especially that grin!  There's a long playlist - 26 songs! - so if you can't find something to like (what's not to like?), maybe you've fallen asleep.  His interaction with the audience is one of the things that makes this video so enjoyable, and the production values are good enough that you sometimes forget you're not at a live show.  An unexpected bonus near the end is an encore version of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" that puts the Beatles' original version to shame, followed by the classic ""Rock 'N' Roll"" done well enough that he has the crowd on its feet.  If you can't get to see him in person, or just want to re-live the experience, this DVD is worth every penny.  Enjoy!",1239494400,,795,4.308724832214765
1933491,5,B0000E32YW,"I AM NOT NORMALLY A FAN OF WILLIE NELSON, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CONCERTS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HOW WELL HE PERFORMS AT HIS AGE. I FIRST GOT THE DVD FROM NETFLIX'S AND WAS SO IMPRESSED, I HAD TO GET A COPY, FOR ME AND ALSO SHARE IT WITH MY BROTHERS WHO ARE WILLIE, FANS. HE SANG SO MANY SONGS, I BELIEVE AT LEAST 25. I ENJOYED THE CONTINUAL SONGS, ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER. ALL HIS PRIME FAVORITES. I ONLY WISHED WAYLON, COULD HAVE JOINED HIM AGAIN. I AM VERY PLEASE TO GET AND ADD THIS TO MY COLLECTION.",1184716800,,527,3.9345794392523366
1933492,2,B0000E32YW,"I love Willie Nelson, but this was a terribly disappointing live performance.  Nelson and his band sleepwalk through their greatest hits, looking bored and uninterested.  Nelson doesn't even sing some of the songs, he just speaks the lyrics. It's as if he's sung these songs a thousand times and can't bear to do it again.

But the lack of energy is just one of the reasons to be disappointed.  Some of the instruments and some of the singing are out of tune.  The sound quality of the recording is not that good either.

I'd walk ten miles in a snowstorm to see Willie play live.  But if you're looking for a Willie Nelson DVD or CD, there are much better choices available.",1177200000,,675,4.483606557377049
1933493,2,B0000E32YW,Willie just doesn't want to hit the high notes any more so sings in a flat style - disappointing. It's been the same now for several of his live efforts - I should've learnt a long time ago.,1166745600,,190,4.026315789473684
1933494,5,B0000E32YW,"This DVD celebrates the best of Asleep at the Wheel's contemporary live show. This newer version of the band is not as strong as the classic version, as seen in the ""In Concert"" DVD. That written, the viewer would hardly know that this is anything less than Asleep at the Wheel in their prime given the actual songs selected and the performance quality. The band plays plenty of Asleep at the Wheel standards like 'Route 66,' 'Boogie Back to Texas' and 'Take Me Back to Tulsa.' Beyond such time tested tunes, newer choices keep the setlist fresh like 'One Six Pack to Go,' 'Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens,' 'Don't Fence Me In,' and 'Cotton Eyed Joe.' Indeed, it must have taken enormous restraint to omit 'Cherokee Maiden.' Ray Benson's charisma is in high gear and Jason Roberts' songs are always welcome. Despite these glowing assets, there are drawbacks. While it was a great idea to have a bilingual musician work in the Tex-Mex influence, Haydn Vitera was clearly the wrong man for the job. He takes second fiddle literally and figuratively as his voice and personality never fit the band. The only saving grace is that compared to the band's regular shows, he only sings one tune for this DVD. Also, double fiddles are a staple of Western Swing -why double steel guitars? There is no Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant type interaction here, Asleep at the Wheel employs two musicians to do one person's job. Granted, these are minor issues. Beyond drawbacks and benefits, we are spared from hearing any of the cheesy songs from the ""Alamo"" album and better yet the audience is saved from hearing Ray Benson's corny crooner material. In this respect, the omitted songs strengthen ""Live at Bill Bob's Texas"" as much as the high quality material that is included. I'd like to award this 4 + 1/2 stars since the Ohne Filter ""In Concert"" DVD is better; the sound and video production made me bump this up to five instead of knocking it down to four. This is a great Alseep at the Wheel concert, watch it and enjoy!",1147478400,12,2012,4.654494382022472
1933495,1,B0000E32YW,"This is probably the worst DVD I ever bought!  Nelson doesn't sing the songs, he just talks them and seems to have no energy at all!",1140480000,4,132,4.076923076923077
1933496,2,B0000E32YW,"I'm a huge Willie fan but this performance just didn't do it for me. The best description that my husband and I could come up with is that Willie and his band seemed ""tired"".",1129161600,10,174,4.147058823529412
1933497,5,B0000E32YW,"This DVD is amazing! Very energetic show from Collin, as always. (Much to the liking of Garth on his upbeat songs) A collection of 26 songs, including his tribute to the troops, *World History 101*. Most of his hits are on here, as well as many others. He rocks the house, truly ROCKS the house, with the Encore, where he returns to perform *I Saw Her Standing There* (A Beatles song), and Rock N' Roll (A Led Zeppelin rocker). He finally closes the show with Love Me, while signing autographs. Also has a Photo Gallery, and several interviews with Collin. This is a must if you are a fan of him, or just a country music fan in general. Much much better than most would expect!",1102204800,4,677,4.380952380952381
1933498,5,B0000E32YW,"The newest incarnation of ATTW is the best yet! The picture and sound are first rate. The performance by the band is fantastic,with the front man Ray Benson just stealing the show with his great voice and stage presence. Musically,these guys are talented and together,with fantastic arrangements of classic

country western songs and a few Ray originals. My favorites are the Cindy Walker songs Your from Texas,and You don,t know me.

Other greats,Amarillo by morning,sung by the awesome lead fiddle player Jason Roberts and a rousing redition of Cotton eyed Joe. Western swing fans will be thrilled by this one!",1099353600,16,612,5.11
1933499,4,B0000E32YW,"My wife & I are big Collin Raye fans. He's one of the best country singers today. This concert is wonderful but be warned. About half of the songs are shortened. Some are just 1 verse & the chorus. I'm not sure whose idea this was. We would have gladly paid extra for a 2 DVD set to get the full versions of the songs or less tracks on 1 disc, but full versions. This has 26 tracks plus bonus material on 1 disc. His comments on the music industry are so true. This DVD is definitely worth the money & we highly recommend it!",1095552000,10,525,4.0095238095238095

8001756,3,B0000E32YW,Being from Texas.. Asleep At The Wheel used to get a lot of radio play around here.  I was never a big fan but they had some good songs.  I think the only top ten song they had was The Letter That Johnny Walker Read which isn't on here.  Ray Benson the lead singer has been around forever but I think the rest of the band has changed quite a few times over the years.  This is a live concert and they do their on western swing type music the best.  With songs like One Six Pack To Go and Big Balls In Cowtown.  And a rather inspired version of Cotton Eyed Joe.  Their cover of Before The Next Teardrop Falls doesn't really work.  But overall this is a good concert dvd.,1499817600,,669,4.015151515151516
