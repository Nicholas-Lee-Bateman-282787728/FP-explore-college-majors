570849,4,6303112137,"Yes, we've all see Peter Cushing's and Robert Clive's respective portrayals of Doctor Frankenstein so many times that we could probably build the monster ourselves if we gave it half a try.  After having given both Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee's monster portrayals our rapt attention over and over, we could also probably discern the footsteps and grrrrs of each respective actor in monster form-sitting ourselves blindfolded.  Thus, in approaching this Frankenstein film, it is of the utmost importance that you turn your mind tabula rosa and forget everything you remember about what a good Frankenstein film should be.  One other thing you should be warned of is that this is a tongue-in-cheek version of the tale, which is manifest during the first fifteen minutes of the film as a young Frankenstein talks his instructor into a heart attack and nonchalantly does his father in for threatening to cancel his allowance.  At this point you will begin to wonder just what kind of movie you have gotten yourself into.  What director Sangster has done is provide us with a satirical minimalist version of the now familiar Frankenstein tale.  Like how Gogol does with his chariactures, the main characters have been stripped down to grotesque emphases of some trait or another.  The most obvious is Bates' Frankenstein.  Gone is the suaveness of Cushing  and absent is the fervor of Clive.  What's left is a fascinating desolation of a raw, amoral intellect that sees everything in the world-even the life accomplishment of creating life-as boring and blase'.  Veronica Carlson's Elizabeth has been reduced from a witty debutante (in previous films) to a doe-eyed gazer.  The police are monomaniacal, O'Mara's Alicia is almost as carnal as Frankenstein is machiavellian, and not to forget the monster himself, Prowse's Frankenstein-like his creator-is devoid of any expression and starts killing almost as soon as his muscles can flex.  There is one golden moment when Prowse captures the monster's rebellious anger when Frankenstein tries to coerce him to sit like a dog before he gets to eat.  Central to this film's success is Ralph Bate's portrayal as the doctor.  After having seen his less than enlightened portrayal in Lust For A Vampire, and his almost effeminate Dr. Jeckyl, I had serious misgivings at first about this film===but he really shines in this one!  The DVD quality itself is good.  There are suitable extras.  I didn't listen to the commentary, but the interview with Carlson was good.  In most stores, this DVD will be priced very reasonably, so you can be sure to get your money's worth.",1053648000,,2614,5.051282051282051
570850,3,6303112137,"Believe me, I really wanted to like this movie. I've become a minor Ralph Bates fan from his surprisingly engaging turns in Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde and Lust for a Vampire; writer/producer/director Jimmy Sangster has been responsible for more than a handful of my favorite Hammer horrors, in one capacity or another; and I'd always thought the monster looked pretty cool. But while the problematic Lust can be excused since it was taken out of his hands, Horror of Frankenstein is entirely Sangster's baby and, unfortunately, one of his biggest misfires. A virtual remake of Curse of Frankenstein with more overt emphasis on sex (but no nudity), the film begins with student Victor Frankenstein (Bates) drawing the ire of his professor for marking dotted lines on a picture of a naked woman (like those meat charts in butcher shops). Influenced no doubt by the `rebellious youth' trend that was currently sweeping Hollywood, Victor is portrayed as insolent and condescending to his professor as well as his boorish father, a sex maniac who thinks Victor's obsession with science rather than carnality is ""unnatural,"" and threatens to cut off his allowance. In short order, Victor arranges his father's `accidental' death, moves to Vienna to pursue further studies, and impregnates the Dean's daughter. Returning in haste to his castle with loads of laboratory equipment, he proceeds to slowly piece together an artifical man (guided by a numbered chart on the wall) with parts provided by a slimy bodysnatcher (Dennis Price in a wonderfully droll performance, certainly the high point of the movie), who eventually meets his end in Victor's acid bath. In a rare noble (or premeditated?) moment, Victor saves Professor Heiss and his daughter Elizabeth (Veronica Carlson) from some highwaymen, giving him a pretext to draw them into his mad experiment, which angers his jealous, blackmailing maidservant/mistress (Kate O'Mara). There are a few clumsy attempts at humor (e.g. Victor sees the number for ""brain"" on Prof. Heiss's forehead during dinner). But my real problem with Horror of Frankenstein is that while Bates retains the cold, ruthless, even cruel pragmatism of Peter Cushing's characterization, he lacks Cushing's essential charisma and dry gallows wit, which always allowed us to half-believe that his single-minded, sometimes criminal, obsession was really in the service of science, and that the various burgermeisters, priests, and constables that always disrupted his experiments were simply philistines who just didn't understand the higher purpose underlying his work. In contrast, Horror's Victor isn't so much Cushing's bold transgressor as a vicious elitist, callously preying on basically good and innocent folk for nefarious and ultimately meaningless ends (he even electrocutes and dissects his friend and assistant Wilhelm). Dave Prowse (Darth Vader; Patrick Magee's bodyguard Julian in Clockwork Orange) is imposing as the monster, but he's pretty much a sadistic killer out of the gate, generating zero empathy in the viewer, quite unlike Karloff's touchstone performance or even several prior Hammer transplantees (e.g. Michael Gwynn, Freddie Jones). Ms. Carlson looks radiant amidst all the smarmy goings-on, but is given little to do. Even as the bodies pile up, the gore is curiously scant, and both the monster's creation and effervescent demise are anticlimactic at best. For my money, this is the worst of the Hammer Frankensteins, cold, mean-spirited, and banal, and recommended only to completists (who will probably still want this for their collections).
Anchor Bay spoils us once again with a superb, definitive DVD release. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is matted to 1.85:1 and features a virtually pristine print with excellent brightness, contrast, sharpness, detail, color balance and saturation, and only some sporadic very light speckling. The Horror of Frankenstein UK trailer is also matted to 1.85:1 and looks equally terrific. The US combo trailer (with Scars of Dracula) is letterboxed but looks dupey and soft, with poor color. Also included are a still/poster/ad gallery of approximately 35 images; Veronica Carlson ""photo album"" of about 55 mostly cheesecake shots; a gallery of 21 of Ms. Carlson's paintings (mostly portraits and still-lifes); relatively comprehensive talent bios of Sangster and Bates; and a 14-minute interview with Ms. Carlson that's interesting but too short to get into any real depth. The audio commentary by Jimmy Sangster and Hammerologist Marcus Hearn is informative, though Hearn has to prod Sangster at times, and they do peter out a bit toward the end. In total, a fine four-star DVD package; too bad the feature attraction only rates a two.",1034640000,,4730,5.393243243243243

571083,3,6303112137,"THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN tells the tale of a pompous young Victor Frankenstein, who returns home from university to resume his studies of the human anatomy at his family estate. Weird happenings begin to shroud the Castle Frankenstein as Victor embarks on his most diabolical experiment yet: The creation of a living being that has been assembled from the bodies of the dead! Hammer Films turns back the clock in this veritable remake of THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, which follows a much younger version of the Baron. Peter Cushing takes a forced sabbatical as Ralph Bates steps into the role of Victor Frankenstein, bringing his own contemptuous vices to the character along with a wry, cynical sense of humor. THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN then becomes a dark satire of Mary Shelley's classic tale, and one that plays off of a very subtle wit. David Prowse portrays Frankenstein's unholy creation as a rather lifeless brute, while Dennis Price puts in a rousing performance as the kooky graverobber. Writer Jimmy Sangster does an excellent job recreating the Gothic allure of the earlier Hammer pictures in his directorial debut, making THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN a welcome sidestep from the original series.

571087,5,6303112137,"A misunderstood classic from Hammer Films. I remember first seeing it inside a hotel room at the Sheraton at Clearwater Beach during the Summer holidays. It came on WTOG Channel 44's Creature Feature with local horror host Dr. Paul Bearer. I loved it when I first saw it. It takes an engaging movie to get your mind off staying at the beach and deciding to be inside for 2-hours during the afternoon.
Jimmy Sangster does a great job of putting in humor throughout the film.
One of my favorites scenes, a hand attached to a severed arm, gives the audience the British V sign (the middle finger in the US.) Yes, its junior high humor but it helps to create a nice transition from scenes of murder and mayhem.
Ralph Bates is a great Victor Frankenstein. He plays the young Victor as a smartass in school to getting into trouble in college and finally the egomatic prideful character he is at the film's end when the ending credits appear.
As I was re-watching this, considering the economic problems today in 2009, I was thinking how great it would be to be Victor Frankenstein. He had a castle, vasts amounts of wealth, and plenty of free time to conduct weirdo experiments in the lab. Who wouldn't want all that?
It becomes all the more tragic as the film progresses to the end result. I would have made better use of time and money, then again, I'm not driven to create life from dead body parts.
Of all the Hammer Frankenstein films, this one is the most fun to watch. The little jokes keeping coming, sometimes where you don't expect them to be.
Also, David Prowse, makes a great Hulk-like monster. As all the fanboys know, Prowse played Darth Vader in Star Wars. Instead of Boris Karloff cautiously leaving the lab by stumbling through the doorway, Prowse, punches out the wooden door with power and confidence. In makes an interesting contrast to the Karloff monster.
What I love about Hammer is the interesting subplots between the house keeper and the beautiful Veronica Carlson as the house keeper tries to blackmail Victor or talk him out of letting Carlson to stay at the castle. Jealousy is what gives a lot of these Frankenstein movies the human side and makes it more fun to see how Victor will react and deal with domestic problems. Every mad scientist needs a good vat for acid to be poured into to get rid of such problems.
As for the extras, Hammer finally throws the fans a bone.

571088,4,6303112137,"Harshly disregarded by critics and fans alike, time has been kind to Jimmy Sangster's tar-black comedy re-jigging of the original breakthrough Hammer Frankenstein film.

'Horror of Frankenstein' is as tasteless as its abrupt, growling, belligerent title implies. Sangster shamelessly rips into his own original 50's script for inspiration, thinking nothing of twisting his own plot-lines to force out some grisly jollity.

Ralph Bates is excellent as the Baron, seemingly more interested in bedding his kitchen staff than creating life. There's a host of Hammer regulars: Jon Finch, Kate O'Mara, Veronica Carlson, Dennis Price and our old friend Vader himself, Dave Prowse, as the creature, all visibly playing up as much as vigorous master Bates.

Sangster's writing is snappy, vulgar and fun. Bates' Frankenstein is an absolute stinker and the monster is a hulking great hooligan, much given to stupidity and cannibalism.

I think most of the resistance to this film was fuelled by the fact it was Cushing-less, but this kind of irreverent parody wouldn't have worked with dear old Props Peter. The (numerous) bedroom sequences would've been an obvious problem, as would the idea of him putting the college Dean's daughter in the club (although that said, he did a fine job of wrestling with a naked prostitute, cutting off her head and packing it in a fridge in 'Corruption,' so who knows!). Versatile and willing as Cushing was, I don't think this one was for him. Playing a younger version of a character he'd played 14 years before, even in a comic context, would've stretched credulity to breaking. (!)

'HoF' is murkily entertaining, and, if you possess a tangled mind like mine, bitingly funny. Although the final joke hints at something we shouldn't be chortling at under any circumstances, the rest is pretty good.
Far, far removed from classic Hammer, but worth a glimpse.",1228867200,4,1884,5.143790849673203
571089,4,6303112137,"The character of Victor Frankenstein in ""Horror of Frankenstein"" is the youngest, handsomest and evilest one I've seen.  Victor will do anything to get what he wants, even kill his own father and best friend.  This one has a reprobate mind; he is very dispassionate about the plights of others.  He displays a flippant, contrite attitude whenever a ""friend"" is harmed.  When questioned by authority, his sarcastic remarks are often humorous.  Victor kills anyone who might reveal his secret hobby of bringing the dead back to life.

  The acting in this gothic horror film from Hammer Production is quite good.  The stellar cast consists of Hammer regulars including Ralph Bates (""Lust for a Vampire""), Kate O'Mara (""The Vampire Lovers""), Veronica Carlson (""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed""), Dennis Price (""Twins of Evil""), and David Prowse (""Vampire Circus"").  There is plenty of suspense, dark humor, and gruesome deaths to keep your attention.

  My major complaint is with the ending.  It was gruesome but abrupt.  I felt that there was much more of the story that needed to be told.  The ending was also left open for a sequel.  Unfortunately, one was never made.

  At one point in the movie, Victor claims that he doesn't know who he really is.  His friend points out that he is kind one moment and cold another.  However, I know that any kindness he exhibits is an act.  He is pure evil, incapable of loving anyone but himself and his work.  He labors to create life but all he can manage to do is destroy it.  Victor is unimpressed when he learns that one of his schoolmates has waited her entire life to marry him; he is only interested in how he can use her love to his advantage.

  Directed by Jimmy Sangster, ""Horror of Frankenstein"" is very enjoyable; it must be purchased by everyone who collects gothic horror from Hammer Production.  It is far different from the other Frankenstein movies which were directed by Terrence Fisher and starred Peter Cushing in the role of Victor Frankenstein.  It has its own unique qualities that must be seen to be believed.",1220227200,2,2074,4.809659090909091

Very familiar Hammer sets.  Very knowing and witty script and direction.  Great colors.  Gorgeous but clueless Veronica Carlson is the only female in the movie whose anatomical parts seem not to interest the baron in the least.  The ending is a hoot.  This one is so different from other Hammer Frankensteins that it may take a few viewings for some fans to appreciate.

There is cleavage, Kate O'Mara, Veronica Carlson,(did I say Cleavage?)blood, good FX, atmosphere and it's all done with a tongue and cheek approach that I found refreshing. It works as a straight horror film, but there are some funny little ""digs"" at the series here and there.

571210,4,6303112137,"""Tomorrow we shall initiate a new series of experiments. Something harmless, like splitting the atom, perhaps?""

Dispensing with Peter Cushing's services and intended to revitalize the series with a younger generation of stars as the studio headed into the uncertain 70s, The Horror of Frankenstein instead found itself on the wrong half of a double-bill with the inferior Scars of Dracula and much detested by many Hammer purists for its tone. Which is a great shame, because this is one of Hammer's best and most delightful latter films as long as you're not expecting the traditional horror film of the title - there may be one of the highest body counts in a Hammer film, but it's not frightening. Instead, despite a wonderfully crude moment with a reanimated hand and the odd joke at the expense of Kate O'Mara's cleavage (""You've put on weight in a couple of places""), rather than pure camp or gothic chiller, this is an elegant comedy of murders with much dry wit. If anything, the influence here is more Kind Hearts and Coronets as the presence of Dennis Price as a grave robber who leaves all the digging to his devoted wife attests. Ralph Bates' young Frankenstein is a sociopath with good table manners but no great purpose: creating life from various assorted body parts isn't a quest to free man from the shadow of mortality, it's just something he wants to do, and if that means killing a tortoise, his father or his best friend then he'll do it without his heart skipping a beat. As the sleeve notes to Anchor Bay's Region 1 DVD note, it's easy to see him as a forerunner of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman.

Although he was uncomfortable in the role, Jimmy Sangster's direction is above average for the studio at this period (their once-top director Terence Fisher's drinking having led by this time to a significant drop in the quality of his work), and the film looks better than a lot of the later Hammers. Despite the traditional 19th Century setting, it's very much of its time, even offering digs at the British welfare state (which makes finding bodies so much harder these days, what with people living longer) and the permissive generation (Victor sees no reason to get married when he can have sex with the hired help whenever he wants and merely sees Veronica Carlson's smitten heroine as a potential housekeeper). It's also quite anarchic in its own way, breaking with the expectations of the Hammer formula. The forces of good are completely powerless, retribution is not handed out and evil goes unpunished at the movie's back-to-the-drawing-board end. Well, more or less...",1206662400,,2606,4.8408071748878925
571211,5,6303112137,"I want to say, up front, that this is a fine gothic Frankenstein film. It's actually based upon a fairly straightforward Frankenstein theme, (semi-mad doctor wants to make monster, the brain is damaged, and the monster kills people), but Dr. Victor Frankenstein (very credibly played by Ralph Bates) comes off as a classic, if cultured, psychopath. He cares naught in the slightest about the sanctity of human life, as long as his vision of creating a man (from used parts) is fulfilled.

Here are the numerous characteristics (events) which generate most viewers' dark paradigm of this particular Dr. Victor Frankenstein:

1. He has the sex drive of Don Juan and Rasputin combined and any  consequences of his amourous advances do not concern him in the least. After impregnating his University Dean's daughter, he just drops her like a hot rock, never giving her a further thought. He also demands double-duty from his lovers... sex slave on demand and housekeeper routinely.

2. He really savours killing people (you can tell by the smirk on his face as he does so), including his father, a highwayman (whom he also decapitates), his best friend and assistant, the provider of his corpses, and a local professor (via poison). He even kills an associate's pet tortoise with a smile!

3. He much enjoys setting his monster to killing: the corpse-snatcher's greedy wife, a lover and, a woodsman who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

4. He's really into personal intimidation of those who are supposed to be his superiors while he is a medical student and later on too.

This 1970 British story goes like this: Dr. Frankenstein decides (as a student) that his big goal will be to create a man (basically from corpse parts) so he takes on a pal whom eventually becomes more and more skittish as the experiments with body parts become more and more audacious and heinous. People who get into the way of the young Doctor's plans are snuffed without a second thought. So, what I'm saying here is that there are no huge surprises.

True to the Hammer philosophy, this film is not hair-raising scary like, say, ""The Exorcist,"" ""Halloween,"" or Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" albeit it's a much darker film than all the other Hammer Frankenstein flicks. This is clearly due to the fact that this movie was directed by Hammer's fair-haired horror writer, Jimmy Sangster, who had clearly been drooling to actually direct one of these films. It's really all just quite entertaining.

There are even intermittent moments of sly humor to be found throughout the movie. At one point, a buxom lass of the Doctor's former acquaintance is practically displaying her mammalian wares for him and he wryly comments, ""You've gained weight in a couple of places."" Nicely put!

The monster is a bit of an enigma. Played by David Prowse, his face is left pretty much unchanged, make-up-wise -- there is just the add-on to the top of the head. The monster thus looks a lot like one of my larger neighbors. He's not a very shrewd monster as the brain, of course, was damaged somewhat by the corpse-snatcher having dropped it. Just your basic killer who generally follows his master's instructions in order to get fed. This particular brain, by the way, was a sort of steel-blue in its hue and I thought that was a little strange.

The filmscore is superb, composed and conveyed by Malcolm Williamson. It embraces that late 60s atmospheric ambiance which goes along so well with period monster flicks, akin to the themes of the great Les Baxter. The film is shot in letterbox and the sets and locations are outstanding. The long shot of the ominous castle is simply timeless. The color saturation is of equal high-quality.

In summary, we do somewhat miss the great Peter Cushing in this Hammer entry; however, it's a fine performance by Ralph Bates and his supporting cast and I think, overall, is one of the best Frankenstein films that I've seen anywhere.",1199923200,,3940,4.829376854599406
571212,2,6303112137,"This 1970 nth sequel from Hammer is a poor relation to their original classic with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Ralph Bates lacks the screen presence and charisma of Peter Cushing, and his portrayal of Victor Frankenstein is actually rather irratating.

There is nothing new in this film. In essence its the classic story re-told, but its all strangely flat for a Hammer film. The only reason it got two stars rather than one is because both Kate O'Mara and Veronica Carlson look gorgeous in the film and there are couple of lovely comedic moments which made me laugh out loud. Sadly though I think this is a reflection of the fact that Hammer really had nothing new to say with this film. Dave Prowse (the Green Cross Code Man) only appears in the last 1/3 of the film and is rather wasted, which is a shame because he made quite an imposing monster.

571213,4,6303112137,"The Horror of Frankenstein is Hammer screenwriter Jimmy Sangster's stab at directing.  This one's got the Hammer crowd divided coz it's a bit different than the classic Hammer films.  It was made in what many consider to be the decline of Hammer in the 70s.  About this time Hammer was looking to reinvent itself and usually upped the sex and violence.  Horror of Frankenstein basically goes back to the plotline of Curse of Frankenstein, and you get the idea that it was supposed to launch a new franchise with the character.  It's part of the Frankenstein series, yet it exists totally outside it.  I guess you could look at it as the Never Say Never Again of Hammer Frankenstein films.  It shows the Baron as a young student, through his years at school and the creation of his first monster.  He lives with his housekeeper/sex slave, his assistant and his cook.  One of his old classmates, a hot blond(Veronica Carlson), is handing herself to him on a silver platter, but he couldn't care less.  As we all know, Frankenstein is obsessed with reanimation, and he devotes most of his time to that.  Naturally this includes hiring a body snatcher for spare parts and occasionally killing someone.  The monster appears over half way through the film and of course goes on a rampage.  It all comes together in an ending that you may not expect.  The biggest issue here is the lack of Peter Cushing.  He is and always will be the greatest man to play the baron, but Ralph Bates isn't too bad.  He's certainly an arrogant little S.O.B.  The monster is played by none other than Darth Vader himself, David Prowse.  The monster here is just a dumb killing machine.  Normally the monster is portrayed as being kinda sympathetic, but here he's just as cold, homicidal and lifeless as his creator.  Alot of shots are taken at this film's attempts at humor.  This is a bit over exaggerated.  There are a few quips here and there, but this movie isn't going for full blown comedy by any means, nor is it played tongue in cheek.  It's rather dark actually, it just so happens the baron says some funny things once in awhile.  While it's easy to just dismiss the movie coz of it's reputation and lack of Cushing, that's not exactly fair.  Any Hammer fan should at least give it a shot.  That doesn't guarantee you'll like it, but you may find that it's not as bad as people have led you to believe all these years.

The only horror to be found here is the screenplay by Sangster.  A silly, pointless, aimless screenplay that goes absolutely nowhere, with a ridiculous creature who resembles a circus strongman, and for unexplained reasons keeps crashing out of the house in a fury, and then inexplicably returning.  One second he's smashing Victor Frankenstein around, the next second he's meekly submitting to his orders.  Truly preposterous stuff.  But the real crime here in not so much that it is an awful film.  The real crime is that Sangster wrote the whole thing as a ridiculous tongue in cheek film.  As one of the main screenwriters of the early Hammer films, he should have known better than most, that Hammerheads, and horror fans in general, like and expect their horror STRAIGHT.  YOU DO NOT DO HORROR TONGUE IN CHEEK, MR. SANGSTER.  It degrades and desecrates the genre.  It is infuriating to any true horror fan, and you can be sure that Peter Cushing would never have agreed to do this film, and for all we know he may well have turned it down after reading the script.  Maybe Sangster should change his name to Gangster, since he has stolen my money.  Don't let him steal yours.",1176854400,,1355,4.642857142857143
571216,5,6303112137,"Hammer Studios tried something different in 1970 with its Frankenstein franchise. Instead of making another sequel with Peter Cushing, it decided on producing an entirely new revisioning. The result is a superb, horrific, and sometimes intentionally funny film that is populated by many characters with unredeeming qualities.

Ralph Bates' ruthless Dr. Victor Frankenstein is unarguably the most evil characterization of the baron ever to grace a film. If you get in his way, he'll kill you withyout ever batting an eye. The monster, played by David Prowse, isn't introduced until more than one-hour into the film. While the monster is a terrifying, mindless murderer, the baron is the true villain here.

Bates performance dominates the film. While it's extremely difficult to root for the guy, you can't help but be interested in what he'll do next in order to achieve his goal. For whatever reason, this film seems to get panned as one of the failures of the Hammer horror pantheon. I strongly disagree with the negative reviews. This is one of the best Frankenstein films ever made. The film is never boring, and it's always scary because you dread what the baron will do next to forward his plans.

I was a child when I saw this film on television in the 1970s. It's not for kids. As for the DVD, it's presented in a pristine anamorphic widescreen and looks great on a high definition television. Good job, Anchor Bay.",1148256000,12,1423,4.8962655601659755

Second, it isn't some comedy meant to be filled with laughs, it is a subtle parody.  The cast is perfect for the way the characters were intended to be portrayed, and the ending is quite clever, a purposefully anti-climactic finish that puts the dot at the end of this clever hairy dog joke of a film.  I detract one star because, though I was surprised at the uniqueness of the film, it isn't one I'd watch repeatedly like the Cushing films.",1136332800,7,601,4.486238532110092
571218,4,6303112137,"Upon looking at the reviews on Amazon and The Internet Movie Database, it seems the general consensus regarding the Hammer release The Horror of Frankenstein (1971), originally released in the UK in 1970, is that it's a prime example of the decline of the work released by the once great studio that revitalized the horror genre, probably most famous for breathing new life into the old Universal horror standards like Dracula and Frankenstein, and making household names out of actors like Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Sure, there are any number of better Hammer Frankenstein films (I think there were six or seven in all) like The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Evil of Frankenstein (1964), the latter to be soon released in a Hammer Horror Series DVD set, but I did enjoy this release, despite the fact the film disregards these previous releases, perhaps in an attempt to develop a new series...problem (one of a few) was, fans were so enthralled with Cushing as Frankenstein and Lee as The Monster, I don't think they were willing to buy off on a variance in the casting (or the humor within), and, subsequently, the film was ill received when released.  Produced, co-written and directed by Jimmy Sangster (X the Unknown, The Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula), the film stars Ralph Bates (Taste the Blood of Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde), one of a handful of male actors Hammer was grooming in the late 60s and early 70s to replace Cushing and Lee.  Also appearing is Veronica Carlson (Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed), Kate O'Mara (The Vampire Lovers), Dennis Price (Horror Hospital), Graham James (Blood from the Mummy's Tomb), Jon Finch (Frenzy), and David `Darth Vader' Prowse (Vampire Circus, Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell, Star Wars) as The Monster.

As the story begins we see a young Victor Frankenstein (Bates), listless with his studies, request from his father that he be sent to the university in Vienna so that he may actually further his studies.  Pop says no, so victor arranges an `accident', and subsequently becomes the new Baron, to do as he pleases (Victor inherits not only his father's estate, but also the comely young housefrau/bedwarmer Alys, played by O'Mera...homina homina).  Anyway, turns out the university is more of the same, so Victor returns home, his classmate Wilhelm (James) in tow, to engage in his own experiments which involve re-animation (since this is a Frankenstein movie, you'd kind of expect that, I suppose).  After an initial success brings back to life a wee, small creature, Victor makes arrangements with a local graver robber (Price) to acquire `raw materials' for a full-blown human experiment.  Wilhelm gets skittery and departs Hammer style.  Victor continues on alone, sewing together his creation (or monstrosity, whichever you prefer), and we learn it takes 25 separate parts to make a whole man...go figure.  Eventually Victor does bring back to life his assemblage of parts (looking a little like the monster played by James Arness from the 1951 film The Thing from Another World), but it has a serious flaw in that the brain was a bit damaged, and the creature has all the intelligence of a sponge...oh yeah, it also likes to kill...oh goody, a nearly seven foot, muscle bound behemoth (Prowse is 6'7'' in real life) with homicidal tendencies...that will go over real well with the locals...anyway, big, bald, and stitchy escapes a few times, some of the household staff attempt blackmail, local buxom blonde (Carlson) has the hots for Victor, and the town constabulary is sniffing around...

Despite its many flaws, I did enjoy this film.  I was impressed with how much was actually going on (much of it unnecessary), how many characters flittering about, and the fact Sangster managed to keep everything coherent and in line.  James character of Wilhelm and Carlson's character of Elizabeth (the buxom blonde) were both essentially useless...I did like Kate O'Mera as the jealous house maid and Price as the grave robber (who made his wife do all the actually digging), but the real treat here was Bates as Victor.  His character is radically different from those versions of Frankenstein we've seen before as while those others often were portrayed as devoted scientists interested in their experiments for altruistic purposes, Bates' character was completely self-centered and only interested in doing what he was doing because he had the brains and talent to do so...his character is a suave, relatively vile, smarmy, entirely conceited, flippant individual always ready with a sly remark, completely uncaring of those around him.  Even his own creation rates the kindness and affection on would bestow upon a stray, mangy, ill-tempered mutt.  And then there's the monster...gone is any sense of empathy for the creature, one `born' into existence not knowing or understanding from whence he came, exhibiting the innocence and gentleness of nave being encased in a powerful, hideous form, hated for no other reason that existing...this is replaced with a soulless, hulking automaton brute whose primary reaction to external stimuli is to destroy it...there is no question of morality of actions raised within this story, no pondering of who the real monster is (Bates and his `creation' are both monsters equally), no regret towards ones actions, but only nasty, unredeemable individuals doing naughty things unto others for their own, base purposes, some getting their comeuppance, some not...which I really didn't mind as much as I thought I would, specifically because how many times can one rehash as story and make it interesting?  Hammer fans will notice the absence of two elements within this film, blood and nekkid women...there is a little bit of hemoglobin, but not nary enough to satisfy.  And as far as the lack of skin, I don't require it within the films I see, but, by this time, it had become customary within Hammer horror films...a flash here or there would have been enough, especially given a pair of lovelies like Carlson and O'Mera...there's some really good cleavage on Ms. O'Mera's part, but that's about it...while the story may not have been up to par with other, better releases, at least the settings and props (the castle, laboratory equipment, and costumes) were up to snuff. All in all, an decent production which will probably be unsatisfying to an expectant many, but for what it was, the effort put forth (those involved all seemed to have fun making the movie), the morbid sense of humor throughout (check out how Victor suggests handling the Dean of the university's daughter after he knocks her up), and Bates' roguish, lecherous character, I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The part I liked best was when Victor, busy searching for parts (which he has numbered on a scale drawing in his lab), envisions one of the numbers on a the head of a visiting man...it's the brain he be needing...

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a sharp widescreen (1.85:1) print on this DVD, along with a suitable Dolby Digital mono audio track.  Included is a commentary track with director Jimmy Sangster and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, a 14 piece titled Frankenstein, Dracula, and Me: Interview with Veronica Carlson, two theatrical trailers, talent bios, a poster and still gallery, a Veronica Carlson photo gallery, a gallery of art by Ms. Carlson (which is pretty pointless, in my mind, all things considered), and liner notes by Travis Crawford, along with a reproduction of original poster art for the film, included on the DVD insert.  A five star release of a 3  star film, hence my four star rating.

If you're expecting the patented Hammer horror impact, you might want to skip this one.  Sure, it has lots of gore and cleavage, but the similarities stop there.

was hesitant to buy it. I finally got a copy from collector along with some other rare movies and I'm glad I finally added to my
collection. While it's not the best of the Frankenstein movies and as any Hammer movie it's very good and better than any
of the crap they call 'horror' today in hollyweird! The movie is well made and directed by Jimmy Sangster who did many movies with Hammer. It would have been better with Cushing as
Frankenstein but Bates did a great job creating his own version of the good evil doctor.
I admit at first it looked like it wouldn't match up to the other movies but it does. I
think Bates could've continue in the role with success given the opportunity. It would
have been great seeing him and Cushing in the same movie working together side by side.
