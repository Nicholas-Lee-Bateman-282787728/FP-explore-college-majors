8440540,5,B004T7O57Y,"A lot of people feel that being a UFC or MMA fan equals being a supposed MMA expert, and a lot of the reviews I've seen here on Amazon certainly prove otherwise. Yes, MMA fans, you are most certainly entitled to your supposed opinions. But there are others out there that have opinions as well, and those opinions happen to be better than the one-liners certain people tend to throw out there as expertise. Now, I really don't care if there are people out there who like MMA or the UFC, but don't talk out of your butt about if, especially if your talk is nothing but ignorant one-liners comparing the UFC with Pride. We know what Pride is and was, and we know what the UFC is today. I really don't care about those thoughts. But I did care about the UFC 129 card. I've watched the UFC 129 card. It is huge, it is stacked, and it is packed with thrills and chills, KO's and submissions, and if there ISN'T a finish, then the fights are still outstanding! Now, if I'm seriously getting under the skin of certain trash-talkers who frequent this forum, and post their supposed Amazon posts? GOOD! That's the point. Because real MMA fans want to read real MMA and UFC reviews, not worthless drivel! Oh yeah, I've got a review to do myself on UFC 129, don't I? Well, read on!

Oh yeah, another thing that I've heard all about is Jake Shields. I've heard it said that if Jake Shields got in the UFC, then the Welterweight Division would have a new World Champion. Really? Ok, well, here's Jake Shields. And um, how exactly did he make his entrance? At UFC 121, he fought against Martin Kampmann to a split decision that wasn't exactly memorable. Yet, because the name was Jake Shields, he automatically gets the next title shot because he'll obviously submit GSP. Really? GSP has NEVER faced anybody like Jake Shields. Ok, that may be true, and Jake Shields has never been submitted. In fact, get Shields on the ground, chances are, you're in trouble! So, is GSP in as big trouble like the FANS are predicting? That's what Toronto, Ontario, Canada is about to find out at UFC 129. And it is the Main Event!

What can be said about Jose Aldo that hasn't already been said? The man is a known killer, and if you actually care to go the distance with this man, you'll probably wish you were dead the next morning! The WEC always had a treat in the performances Aldo put on. And now is the time to put that talent on display at the Big Show, and Mark ""The Machine"" Hominick is ready to put him to the test and take his belt! Now, Hominick's first UFC appearance was UFC 58, and he fought impressively against Yves Edwards, earning a submission in the 2nd round. When he came back, it was against George Roop, and Roop's striking didn't even appear relevant against Hominick. Will the man with the cardio and push-ups put on a performance worthy of taking Jose Aldo's belt? That's the Co-Main Event!

And speaking of Champions, 2 of them are going to go at it. Randy ""The Natural"" Couture is taking on Lyoto ""The Dragon"" Machida. Will Randy shock the world one more time, or will ""The Machida Era"" get one more run and highlight on UFC soil?

There's nothing not to love about UFC 129. There are 12 fights on this card, I'm going to list 'em below!

Yves Jabouin vs. Pablo Garza: Ok, this is a crazy 1st round with CRUSHING leg kicks, 2 game fighters, and a beautiful flying triangle to put a stamp on a 1st round submission!

John Makdessi vs. Kyle Watson: On the 12th Season of The Ultimate Fighter, Kyle Watson was a pretty big threat, until he had to face Brookins in the Semi-Finals. But he did win his UFC debut over Sako Chivitchian in that Finale Card. Makdessi impressed a lot of fans in his UFC 124 debut against Audinwood with his slick striking and misdirection. This had both fighters taking shots, one more so than the other, and a spinning backfist knocks the other man out cold! 3rd round KO, and it is a stunner.

Jason MacDonald vs. Ryan Jensen: Could somebody please tell me why Ryan Jensen was still with the UFC at this point? To face ""The Athlete,"" of course. This fight ends with a submission early in the 1st round, and I couldn't be more thrilled!

Ivan Menjivar vs. Charlie Valencia: Both of these guys are game, looking for the W in the UFC. A crushing elbow takes care of that in the 1st round. Nice TKO.

Claude Patrick vs. Daniel Roberts: I'm almost thinking that this is a fight to possibly be overlooked on this card. Don't make that mistake. Claude Patrick always brings his best, so you'd better bring yours! Daniel Roberts might very well lack in striking, but he does have 2 SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT awards. And this is a very game back and forth battle that earns a unanimous decision!

Sean Pierson vs. Jake Ellenberger: In his UFC debut, Pierson fought his heart out, earning an impressive decision win over Riddle. So he gets a true test in Jake Ellenberger. And one of them gets a quick KO in the 1st round.

Nate Diaz vs. Rory MacDonald: I'm going to tell you a story about this fight. My wife is a DIE-HARD Nate Diaz fan. I had one thing to say to her when this fight was announced. I told her when this fight was over, she'd also be a Rory MacDonald fight. I was right! Impressive display of talent on all levels, refusing to play the other man's game, earning a very dominant unanimous decision! Nobody's dominated the losing fighter like he was dominated in this one.

Mark Bocek vs. Ben Henderson: Hey, I'm not exactly Canadian, but Bocek has always been one of my favorites. Ben Henderson was always a favorite in the WEC, and today, even more so in the UFC. This is a unanimous decision where one man is better than the other, but you can't exactly say the other man was completely out of it. 30-27, yes, but a good scrap!

Vladimir Matyushenko vs. Jason Brilz: If anybody's ever finished Vladdy, only the best have ever managed that. And up to this point, nobody's knocked out Brilz. Well, somebody's fortune changes in 20 seconds with a 1st round KO!

Randy Couture vs. Lyoto Machida: The finish in this fight is a shot heard around the world for good reason. Anderson Silva did it, so why can't everybody else? Karate Kid remixed with a beautiful kick that takes out a tooth in the 2nd round! Either way, thank you, Randy Couture, for being the best Captain America there ever was, and ever will be in MMA!!!

Jose Aldo vs. Mark Hominick: WOW! What a fight, and that's all there is to say about that. Unanimous decision, incredible, enough said!

Georges St-Pierre vs. Jake Shields: Ok, tell me again who's going home with the belt? How's this fight going to end? Hmm? Well, maybe not exactly the way YOU figured it was supposed to go down, but I was satisfied! Unanimous decision.

My title says it all. I do have a challenge. And that challenge is rather simple. If you really feel that this card is so stupid, with 7 beautiful finishes, and amazing fights all night? Then quit watching UFC and MMA! Your opinion isn't exactly valued if that's your attitude toward this card. I loved it, and I'm pretty sure that most true MMA fans valued the quantity and quality of this card. If quanitity AND quality are worth your money? That's what this DVD is for. Go get UFC 129!!!",1331424000,2,7213,4.448145344436034
8440541,3,B004T7O57Y,"I want more first round highlight finishes by knockout or submissions.

I was hoping to see GSP run through and finish Jake Shields in the 1st round. It didn't happen.",1327363200,,167,4.566666666666666
8440542,4,B004T7O57Y,"It's fair to say that the UFC has come a long way in it's near 18 year history, from nearly going out of business to being the one of the biggest Pay Per View draws in the world, they would shatter their own attendance record on April 30, 2011 by selling out Canada's Rogers Center(formerly the sky dome) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It's all very well breaking attendances records but it's the Fights that most people would prefer to talk about and happily UFC 129 delivered.

Headlined a contest between Canada's Georges St-Pierre who would defend his Welterweight Title against the dangerous Jake Shields who was on a 15 fight winning run and hadn't been beaten in over 6 years. To be honest it's not a great fight and doesn't really deliver anything great, much better is Jose Aldo defending the UFC Featherweight Championship for the first time against Canadian Mark Hominick who has the late Shawn Thomkins in his corner, it's a great fight that has a good few edge of seat moments.

Also on the card is UFC Hall Of Famer and multiple time champion Randy Couture making his last ever appearance against the dangerous Lyoto Machida, would Couture be able to use his wrestling to nullify Machida's dangerous Karate striking game? Vladimir Matyushenko a veteran of UFC 32 takes on Jason Brilz. Also on the main card is Canadian Mark Bocek taking on former WEC Lightweight champion Ben Henderson who is making his debut in the UFC.

The full set of preliminary fights are included on Disc two including a great battle between rising star Rory Macdonald and Skrap Pack member Nate Diaz. There's a great battle between John Makdessi and Ultimate fighter season 12 contestant Kyle Watson. Also watch out for Ivan Menjivar taking on Charlie Valencia. There is also the full countdown show included which if you haven't seen the event is where you should start.

UFC 129 has plenty of action and is a historic moment in UFC & MMA's short history and is one UFC DVD that you must own as a reminder of a fantastic night for the sport.",1316390400,2,2029,4.675070028011205
8440543,5,B004T7O57Y,"Just like every other UFC dvd i have purchased. Non stop edge of seat action and with the two new weight classes. WOW!
GSP never fails to put on an impressive show and it is great to see Randy is still in there with the best. I always wait for the dvd's to come out so i can listen to what they are saying between rounds. You miss that on ppv because of the commercial breaks. Just received UFC 130 and i cant wait to watch it.",1312675200,,427,3.9195402298850577
8440544,5,B004T7O57Y,"One of the best top to bottom events you see.

The prelims are stellar as well as the under card.

The only weak spot was the main event with GSP getting scratched/poked in the eye in the 2nd round.
Limited him to sloppy striking though he does knock Shields down with a head kick later in the fight.

The finish to the Machida/Couture fight was spectacular.

I Highly recommend adding this to your collection.",1312070400,,410,4.5
8440545,5,B004T7O57Y,"I ordered the PPV for this and it was an amazing event! The main event was a let down, but the rest of the fight card made up for it! 7 out of the 12 fights were either submissions or TKO's! It was just an amazing event!",1304467200,2,220,3.702127659574468
