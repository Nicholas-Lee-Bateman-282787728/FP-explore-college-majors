2678299,5,B000JMKK7W,"Those who love good theatre musicals should not miss getting their own copy of Hey, Mr. Producer. It's an incredible medley of some of the best music and matching lyrics ever composed for the theatre.  We watch it often and each time enjoy it as much as when we first saw it. Timeless!!!",1233100800,3,287,4.415094339622642
2678300,5,B000JMKK7W,"In case you did not known, Cameron Mackintosh ia a major producer of musical theater in London's  West End. This tribute concert was produced in 1998 at the Lyceum Theater in London, and includes some of the biggest names in musical theater at that time. The concert chronicles many of the shows that Mr. Mackintosh has produced over the years including Little Shop of Horrors, Five Guys named Moe, Miss Saigon, The Phantom of the Opera, Company, Cats and Les Miserables, just to mention a few.

Fans of West End theater will recognize many of the performers including Maria Friedman, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Ruthie Henshall and Lea Salonga. Bernadette Peters also makes an appearance, but my favorite highlights are Jonathan Pryce singing ""American Dream"" from Miss Saigon and a young Hugh Jackman singing ""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'"" from Oklahoma. Elaine Page also makes an appearance to sing ""Memory"" from Cats. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim both make appearances and do a ""dueling piano's"" number that anyone who has ever done any work in the theater will appreciate.

This is really a must have for any fan of the musical theater.",1224374400,13,1155,4.974093264248705
2678301,5,B000JMKK7W,"This DVD gives you a glimpse to many great Broadway musicals, enough to wet your appetite to see them in actual theatres.  This concert was performed by all big-name stars, and even the queen herself attended this concert!  I love the performances.  The picture and sound quality is superb.

I bought an imported one (from another web site), which has some Chinese texts on the box and the DVD also provides Chinese subtitles.  I'm not sure if it's the same version on Amazon.com.  On my version, though, the English subtitles contain some annoying typos.

Performers actually acted out their parts and there are some props on stage which is great, unlike some other concert DVDs I've seen where performers simply dress up and sing at the microphones.  The tribute video clip to Cameron done by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Stephen Sondheim (I think) was full of humors.

Because of the time constraints, many of the pieces are cut short, which I find unfortunate.  But what can you expect when they try to fit a bunch of shows to only within a few hours?  It only contains enough to make you long for more.",1210896000,10,1101,4.652849740932642
2678302,5,B000JMKK7W,This is certainly one of the top 5 videos in my collection now.  What a terrific group of famous Broadway-style singers and British too.  What a wonderful assembly of songs from some of my favorite musicals of all time includeing Miss Saigon.,1207440000,4,242,4.738095238095238
2678303,5,B000JMKK7W,"""My Fair Lady"", ""Oliver"", ""Les Miserables"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""Cats"", ""Miss Saigon"" all packed in one DVDs. My favourites include Jonathan Price as Professor Higgins singing ""I've grown accustomed to her face, ""You've got to Pick a Pocket or Two"" from Oliver, ""send in the clowns"" by Judi Dench, ""Oh! What a beautiful morning"" from Oklahoma and the lovely melodies from Les Miserables. Though the performances were dated back in 1998, the star studded performances made a lasting impression nevertheless. The songs were enchanting melodies but it's the presence of the singers and the great chorus that maded this DVD truly special. And the line up of seven songs from ""Les Miserables"" highlighted the great work of Cameron Mackintosh. A wonderful treat.",1184716800,22,760,5.186991869918699

A 27 year old Lea never cuter or in better voice performing Kim, ponine and other parts (note Sam Barks my second favorite ponine was only 8 at the time).. The great Michael Ball as Marius and other parts as well. Too many stars to mention. Dame Judy Dench a standing ovation for her performance. Hugh Jackman at 30 playing Curley. The list seems endless.

2678315,5,B000JMKK7W,"""Hey Mr Producer!""  This DVD is a live recording of a 1998 concert given at the Lyceum Theatre, London, as introduced by Dame Julie Andrews (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B0044XRIMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>), in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen and HRH the Duke of Edinburgh. It was a charity gala in aid of the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the Combined Theatrical Charities, and was originally recorded for television.  It is one disk, totaling 164 minutes, and, it appears, at least 56 songs, from some of the biggest, most popular shows to play New York's Broadway and/or London's West End, all produced by Cameron Mackintosh. And it brings together on one stage quite a few theatrical and celluloid stars, for a total of over 200 performers.

Among the first favorites are likely to be a generous selection of five songs from Frederick Lowe's and Alan Jay Lerner's ""My Fair Lady,"" as sung by Liz Robertson, Jonathan Pryce, and others. We also get a nice selection of three songs from the under-appreciated masterpiece ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (creators of Disney's beloved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/B008Q5LQPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>: two of the songs are delivered by Ellen Greene, who created the part of Audrey on Broadway; and played it in the delightful movie of the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Shop-of-Horrors/dp/B001EBWIRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Shop of Horrors</a>). Bernadette Peters delivers a nice ""Unexpected Song,"" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Song & Dance."" English stage star Sonia Swaby gives us a heart-felt ""As Long as He Needs Me,"" from Lionel Bart's ""Oliver."" Then another generous selection of five songs from ""Miss Saigon,"" in which Lea Salonga and Jonathan Pryce reprise tunes they created on Broadway, as they created their roles: Pryce gives us his ""American Dream,"" which was greatly praised at its debut.

Next come two favorite, powerful songs from Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera:"" ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" and ""Music of the Night."" Bernadette Peters comes back to lead ""Broadway Baby,"" from Stephen Sondheim's ""Follies."" She will reappear later to give us ""Being Alive,"" from Sondheim's ""Company;"" she also leads an all-star ""You've Gotta Have a Gimmick,"" from Sondheim's masterful ""Gypsy,"" in which she recently played Rose on Broadway. (And I was lucky enough to see her!).  But where oh where is Peters' riveting take - and now her signature song-- of ""Rose's Song"" from this show?  Anyway, then we get some lovely music from ""Carousel,"" by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein. The multi-talented, gorgeous and sexy Australian Hugh Jackman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine/dp/B004UPANAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>) gives us a memorable ""Oh What a Beautiful Mornin',"" from the same immortal pair's ""Oklahoma."" Judi Dench gives us a heart-breaking take on that you might-have-thought-over-exposed classic, ""Send in the Clowns,"" from Sondheim's ""A Little Night Music."" Then, ""Jellicle Songs,"" and ""Memory,"" from Lloyd Webber's evergreen ""Cats:"" British stage star Elaine Page does the latter, also over-exposed favorite, full justice. (Although I will always love best Betty Buckley's performance of the song, as she was the Grizabella I first saw.)The disk closes on a good selection from ""Les Miserables,"" for fans of that play: Lea Salonga gives us a lovely ""On My Own:"" we also get ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" and ""One Day More.""

I first bought this concert on CD, on First Night Records because I wanted Judi Dench's version of ""Send in the Clowns"" in the worst way.  But time went by, and I wanted to SEE Dench perform this song.  Mind you, I consider myself as sophisticated as most, and scorned the many takes I heard round and about of this once too popular song.  Until I heard Dench's.  Of course, Dame Judi Dench has recently been more active on screen than stage---she won a 1998 Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her queen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-In-Love/dp/B004SIP9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare In Love</a>; has also recently done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Exotic-Marigold-Hotel/dp/B008VVT51U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>, and is now playing M in the James Bond movies. But Dench starred as Desiree in a 1996 London revival of ""A Little Night Music,"" at the Royal National Theatre, and critics used up all their accolades on that one. Unfortunately, the cast recording of that show is long since out of print, and when it does show up, it's horribly pricey. So I sought her ""Send in the Clowns"" at this concert.  And I was pleased to find a lot more favorites here. Now, frankly, I do prefer this concert in DVD to CD.  It's just much nicer to be able to see all of these marvelous songs sung: many of them, such as ""You Gotta Have a Gimmick,"" from ""Gypsy,"" are presented in enjoyable production numbers.

One little advisory though: had barely begun the show when I was startled to find Chinese subtitles crawling across the screen.  Hadn't even yet requested subtitles, as I generally do these days, as am losing my hearing, but prefer to know what I'm listening to.  Did some fiddling, was able to find English.  If you want English subtitles, be patient and look for them. You're getting a lotta bang for your buck here.",1372032000,3,5758,5.7236533957845435
2678316,5,B000JMKK7W,I had this concert on vhs and it finally wore out. It is a classic that every broadway  addict should have in their collection.,1371600000,,127,4.291666666666667
2678317,1,B000JMKK7W,"The ad never mentioned that the DVD was covered with Japanese sub-titles. The DVD is damaged and skips large areas of the DVD.  Just disgusting. Asked for a refund - never received it.

2678318,1,B000JMKK7W,"DVD arrived promptly, in thin plastic post-bag with no padding apart from its hard cover case. Why it had to go from the US to a little town in Germany-and re-directed via Frankfurt to Sydney, Australia (in the South Pacific), I will never know. That made me nervous, for good reason. Within seconds of pressing PLAY it was obvious this was a cheap dub, which at its source seems to have originated from Asia...probably China (famous for mass pirating of DVDs) as it was dubbed with CHINESE SUBTITLES from beginning to end. Took me forever to get rid of them. It's an amateurish dub with the MENU page located at the end of the program! The WARNING Notice at the head is half English and half in Chinese. Tried watching it again last night and the Chinese subtitles came back again! It IS the actual program however, it looks like a cheap most probably pirated copy and the ""DOLBY Surround Sound"" as written on the cover, really isn't there. I find it UNWATCHABLE. I had the original VHS copy but this one does not compare. Skin tones are greenish. I complained to the company who graciously offered to take it back and send me another copy but by this stage I lost confidence in them and the fact that I'd get the Real McCoy. Won't deal with them again. Upon further checking on the net I see there are masses of complainants for this company. Buyers beware!

Not the real deal. A cheap (pirate?) copy with CHINESE Subtitles from beginning to end. MENU page located at the end!?? DOLBY STEREO no existent. Can't watch it. Total disaster. There are many complaints on the net accusing this company of scamming people. I did think I could trust the sellers on Amazon but after this I suggest that you check the sellers' Bona Fides yourself.",1364342400,13,1739,4.555910543130991
2678319,5,B000JMKK7W,"This DVD has it all. It showcases the genius of Cameron MacIntosh who is one of London's brightest show minds.

For the price of this DVD they should have either been eliminated, or there should have been some way for the user to do so himself. Very, very disappointing.",1341187200,2,520,4.360824742268041

8152491,1,B000JMKK7W,"It's a bootleg. No doubt about it, aside from the fact that it automatically started playing with Chinese subtitles, (it did not go to a menu) the quality is poor, the audio stinks (quiet, echo-y), the video is kind of blurry and the subs bleed across the screen. I understand that the show is almost 20 years old but it looks and sounds like a digital copy pulled from an old VHS tape and slapped on a DVD by someone using freeware on a home computer. And if you read the back cover it actually says cassette tape on it like they also copied the box the VHS had come in. They sell these exact same DVDs on ebay for around $6, I wish I had known before I shelled out $30 for this one. I expected more from something fulfilled by Amazon.
And as for the shipping it was just tossed into a box loosely with two fairly heavy items, the case was broken and the clear cover that lays over the paper insert was torn halfway up the side.

There are some good things though,
It is watchable.
The artists are great.
The subs can be changed to English, or turned off completely.
All the words to the songs are subtitled, as far as I know. Which is something you don't usually get with musicals (great for the hearing impaired)

All in all, it can be watched so buy it if you're will to risk getting a bootleg, but it certainly is not worth the cost (bootlegging is illegal) and I will be sending it back.",1494460800,,1393,4.1940298507462686
