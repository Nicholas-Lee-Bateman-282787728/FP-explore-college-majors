The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet starring Ozzie, Harriet, David and Ricky Nelson, is television's longest running situation comedy. America watched as this active middle-class American family grew up. Created, directed and written by Ozzie Nelson.

Stories revolve primarily around the four Nelsons, with a notable neighbor, Thorny Thornberry, who can be counted on to offer Ozzie ill-timed advice. As the series progressed, and the boys began to date, a succession of friends began to appear. The show that aired on April 10, 1957, featured son Ricky singing I'm Walkin (Fats Domino hit).
