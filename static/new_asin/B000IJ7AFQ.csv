8145746,5,B000IJ7AFQ,"There are two very fun films in this double feature no self-respecting classic film buff will want to miss! Both offer a great time on a Saturday morning or late at night when you can't sleep. They are both family friendly as well, with ""Nancy Drew, Reporter"" especially great for parents of younger ones.

NANCY DREW, REPORTER

Bonita Granville was a delightful ball of fun during the 1930's in this ""B"" series from WB. This entry was one of the best in the series. She looks cute as a button dressed by Milo Anderson and brings energy to the ""B"" script by Kenneth Gamet. Director William Clemens keeps everything moving quickly for an enjoyable bit of fun for young mystery fans, and film buffs fond of the always terrific Bonita Granville.

Nancy gets her chance as a reporter along with some other girls as a promotion run by the local paper. There's a fifty dollar prize and a medal for the student who turns in the best story after three days. The weary editor hands out some generic fluff to each girl but, of course, Nancy is more interested in the big story involving the death of rich elderly woman, and off she goes to the inquest instead.

When the verdict turns out to be murder by a rare poison used in photograhy, Nancy is hot on the case! Betty Amann is the innocent girl, Paula Denning, Nancy tries to clear by beating everyone to the container with the real killer's fingerprints on it. But a boxer named Soxie (Jack Perry) with a disfigured ear wants it too and uses his girlfriend (Sheila Bromley) to grab it from her in a crowd.

Nancy can't do it alone so enlists the help of her pal Ted (Frank Thomas Jr.) with a new hat. Granville and Thomas were good together and it was endearing that he didn't quite realize he was Nancy's boyfriend. Dickie Jones and Mary Lee were also fun as Ted's young siblings wrangling their way into everything. There's a fun scene where they end up having to sing for their meal at the Mandarin Cafe while in hot pursuit of the story.

John Litel portrayed Nancy's dad, Carson Drew, in the series and there is one especially nice scene between the two that is filled with warmth and the fun of a father/daughter relationship. Nancy tricks him into helping the Denning girl but with Nancy and her pals on the case, the outcome is never really in doubt.

There is a delightful entry with a marvelous ending typical of the series. This one is a fine mix of energy and humor and won't disappoint fans of the sweet Bonita Granville, a young and shining star from the era who deserves to be remembered.

TOPPER RETURNS

A great cast and the perfect blend of humor and mystery make this entry in the series based on Thorne Smith's characters one of the very best. Roy Del Ruth's direction and a better than average screenplay by Jonathan Latimer and Gordon Douglas, and an added bit of dialog from Paul Gerard Smith make this one a lot of fun.

Lovely Carole Landis is Ann Carrington, traveling to see her very ill father with her good pal Gail Richards (Joan Blondell). A sniper shoots out the tire on their cab and the girls are stranded until Topper and his driver Eddie (Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson) happen by and before you know it, and with reservations by Eddie, they are dropping off the two at the old haunted Carrington Castle. Cosmo (Roland Young) may think the only trouble he is in is from his wife (Billie Burke) but events will soon occur which will make that problem pale by comparison.

It is obvious right away that someone wants Ann out of the way when a chandelier mysteriously falls from the ceiling and just misses its target. Landis is terrific as the soon-to-be wealthy Ann and Blondell shines as her wise-cracking friend fond of nice things. Gail's penchant for luxury will be her undoing when Ann switches rooms with her friend so she can have the swanky one.

Gail is murdered in the night and her ghost wants to know why. She walks on moonlit clouds to Topper's house and, once again, Cosmo is having trouble with the netherworld. He's also having trouble with Eddie, who sleeps in a full-length fur coat and wants nothing to do with spooks!

Rochester nearly steals the film from Blondell and Young at this point. His reactions to Topper's interaction with someone he can't see, followed by the discovery of the body, which soon disappears, has Eddie running back home to pack. His line about going back to Mr. Benny is an endearing reference for fans of old radio.

Bille Burke has some hilarious moments when she comes to help Topper. Her conversation with the detective is priceless. Landis' Ann has some nice moments also as a love interest develops with the cab driver. Blondell is great, of course, and Young does a nice job of being frustrated as usual.

When Eddie has a confrontation with a seal and sees the missing body being taken to sea in an underground cavern just beneath the house, he and Cosmo and Gail aren't too far from solving the mystery.

There is a fine ending to this fun and atmospheric mystery with a lot of humor. Landis and Blondell look great in gowns by Royer but get to show off their talent as well here. This is a topflight production with the easy likability of a good ""B"" film but the classy surroundings of an ""A"" film. Both these films offer an excellent time at the movies.",1173571200,4,5285,4.5299055613851
8145747,4,B000IJ7AFQ,"Topper Returns was so much fun! I loved the actors, the story line, and the mixture of comedy and mystery. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore!

Nancy Drew was fun, too; even my 17 year old daughter, who is a Nancy Drew book and game fan, enjoyed watching this B&W movie. The only problem was that about half way through, there was some kind of problem with the film stopping and we  had to rewind and fast forward to get it moving again. We removed the CD, cleaned it off, and reinserted, and it still hesitated a couple of times, but then cleared up and ran fine the rest of the way. Not sure what caused the problem, it could have been us, but in any event, we still enjoyed the story and wish there had been more Nancy Drew movies produced with these same actors back then.",1168905600,9,790,4.225165562913907
