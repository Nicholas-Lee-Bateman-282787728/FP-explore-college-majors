2789309,4,B000O179GI,"My husband & I are big John Wayne fans & this collection is so wonderful.  Our favorite movie is ""The High & the Mighty"" as you sit on the edge of seat wondering how it will all end.  We enjoyed the theme song for ""The High & the Mighty"" very much.  ""Island in the Sky"" is so exciting & not as familiar to fans as the other films are but just as good as the others in this collection.  ""Donovan's Reef's"" is a comic delight with lots of Hawaiian music thru-out the movie.  This one was our 2nd favorite & ""Island in the Sky"" was our 3rd favorite.  You don't want to miss ""Hatari"" & ""In Harm's Way"" as they're very enjoyable.  What a good collection of John Wayne movies!!!",1301616000,,672,4.123076923076923
2789310,5,B000O179GI,"THE JOHN WAYNE ADVENTURE COLLECTION is five of Duke's better 1950s and '60s productions. Each widescreen transfer in this currently out-of-print box is on its own disc; extras are minimal.

SYNOPSES--

DONOVAN'S REEF reunites ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liberty-Valance/dp/B001TWT0AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liberty Valance</a>"" vets Duke, Lee Marvin and director John Ford. Filmed in Hawaii and with a Xmas subtext, the two former navymen meet once a year on their mutual birthday for drinks and fisticuffs.

HATARI! features Hank Mancini's famous ""Baby Elephant Walk."" It's the story of a group of African hunters that collect animals for zoos and the lady photographer who disrupts their little circle, especially with her penchant for adopting infant pachyderms.

In THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, engine trouble on a commercial trans-oceanic flight unnerves the pilot, so his back-up, Dan Roman (Wayne) slaps some courage into him. A loss of fuel from an errant bullet that hits but doesn't explode (?) a gas tank means they may not make it to shore. Co-pilot Roman however refuses to give up.

Otto Preminger's IN HARM'S WAY is a WWII epic with soap opera undertones. Here, Duke is a heavy cruiser commander who's relieved of duty after issuing some questionable orders while at sea during and just after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. He's given a desk job for some months but eventually gets a second chance at command in the South Pacific campaign.

ISLAND IN THE SKY is a story of survival under harsh winter conditions. Duke's transport plane crashes in an uninhabited area of Labrador and it's his responsibility as pilot to keep everyone from freezing to death until they can be rescued.

It is full of action, some comical moments, romance, suspense, and a pretty good description of the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941......what more could a person ask for?!!!  Hatari has some of those same ingredients , and is sheer delight to watch over & over, if for no other reason......just to watch the animal scenes.  Donovan's Reef is mostly comedy, but it has the added attraction of some excellent scenery.  I am a dedicated fan of the Duke, and I can highly recommend this package for hours of great entertainment",1473379200,5,678,4.56198347107438

2789377,5,B000O179GI,"OK -- these are classic John Wayne movies and worthy of 3- or 4-star ratings, even if you're a JW fan. Personally, I prefer his later Westerns as an ageing hero better fits his somewhat limited acting range. So why the five stars? My octogenarian dad has final stage Alzheimer's and all that's left is his love of John Wayne. These movies continue to provide two-hour slices of near-normalcy into a situation one has to be in to be able to understand.",1406678400,,451,4.512195121951219

If you have not viewed this movie, you missed one of the best of John Wayne. I will not get into the plot, but you will love it as much as I enjoyed seeing it again. It's worth the money spent.
DONOVAN'S REEF; -- Post WWII, where a few servicemen elected to stay on a pacific island after the war was over. A light-hearted comedy you'll love it.
HATARI; -- Another lighthearted comedy about capturing live animals for zoos. Action, Danger, Romance and Comedy. This is another fine movie to watch",1397865600,5,662,4.479338842975206

2789386,3,B000O179GI,"I enjoy always Donovan's reef vey much. It is so happy film that one just must like it. Lee Marvin should have a bit more to do, but this is good enough. This is 4,5 star film. Wayne is always good to watch. One gets the feeling that he (and Marvin) are really enjoying themselves.
I have, of course, seen Hatari before, but the story is very thin, almost nonexistent. The actions in Africa are great, but I did not care about the ""international"" actors. You could hear various kinds of accents, but acting was not that good. Beside Wayne I liked Bruce Cabot best. Michele Girardon was O.K., too. Being a health researcher and teacher, I just could not take lightly the continuous smoking and drinking without being sorry for Wayne and others. I also felt sorry for animals.
In Harm's way had too much room personal relationships and less war-related activities. A bit too melodramatic to my taste. This is not one of the best of Wayne's films. It is one of the weakest in my mind. Patricia Neal is good and of more similar age to Wayne than Elsa Martinellin in Hatari.",1393113600,,1069,4.487179487179487

2789414,5,B000O179GI,"There are three movies in this DVD, all of which are excellent.  I believe the best of the three is 'In Harm's Way' where John Wayne played a naval admiral and saved 'Operation Skyhook' for the U.S.  This story is loosely based on the Guadalcanal campaign which began with the Marines of the 1st Division landing there in 1942.  Wayne was excellent in this portrayal.  The second movie is 'Donovan's Reef', a comedy but very good indeed with Lee Marvin, Jack Warden and the beautiful Hawaiian Islands, worth the time to view and finally, 'Hatari', a wild animal adventure in Aftrica and the caputure of a massive Rhino being the main plot.  Red Buttons stars with the Duke.
The disk was shipped in a very timely manner and well in advance of the promised time and the condition was excellent.  If your a fan of John Wayne in his mid-career, this is a must for your video library.",1372550400,,879,4.531645569620253

I'd seen ""Hatari!"" {from whence Henry Mancini's ""Baby Elephant Walk"" comes} and read about ""Donovan's Reef,"" so I started with the third movie.

""In Harm's Way"" is a 2 hour 45 minute WWII epic directed by Otto Preminger with excellent ensemble performances by, in addition to John Wayne and Kirk Douglas:

Patricia Neal, Henry Fonda, Caroll O'Connnor, Burgess Meredith, Franchot Tone, Paula Prentiss, Dana Andrews and Stanley Holloway, not to mention a who's-who of character actors of the period in supporting roles.
[Trivia: Larry Hagman (Dallas) is the comm. officer who warns of hearing Japanese radio chatter before the attack begins.]

2789419,3,B000O179GI,"I really just wanted the great classic In Harms Way, but could not pass up the price of this 3-piece collectors mini-pack.

I did manage to watch Hatari! If it was not for the action footage the film would be unbearable. The animal action footage is great. It's real life live animal collection shot on the African savannah. Real good stuff. There are also interesting scenes of African tribes people living their normal lives, not acting it up for the cameras. The remainder is just awful. The acting is stiff, but that's for a reason. The reason is the awful script. But that's for a reason too. The whole story is stupid and pointless. There is no plot, no point, no nothing. Except for cool live action footage.

I tried watching Donovan's Reef, but stopped. Maybe it gets better than the ultra-lame setup, but I'll never know. I read the synopsis on Wikipedia and put the disc away.

I won't write a review of In Harms Way. Just watch it. Now there's a classic film for you. Well worth the purchase price all by itself.",1367452800,,1024,4.524324324324325

Its a Christmas theme and as far as I'm concerned , probable his best movie, at least to me. I love it and anyone that is a fan of J.W. will love it also. It would be a treasure addition to any collection. In Harms Way..... what can one say... Its all in the title... A great war classic!!!Hatari now... this is a different role for J.W. , He just shows he is very talanted in any roll given him.

""In Harms Way"" is a tale of 5 people who put themselves in harms way and you get to see how that effects their lives and how they deal with it.  Lots of action and lots of romance.
""Hatari"" is a jolly romp in Africa.  Oh those camera shots!!!
""Donovan's Reef""  beautiful scenery.  Edith Heads costuming and a timely romance. The best part is getting to watch a John Wayne look repentive to his superior officer!! Hilarious!!!",1353628800,,611,4.092436974789916

2789476,5,B000O179GI,"John Wayne was one of the most prolific stars in history appearing in around 180 movies from 1929 until he died.  These are three good movies to get and to get them in a single package like this at a great low price is well worth it.  Donovan's reef is set in the Pacific sometime after the war and focuses on two former navy buddies trying to protect a friend from a surprise visit from his daughter who grew up snooty Boston.  It is fun to watch the back and forth play between John Wayne and Lee Marvin througout the movie.  Hatari is based on the animal collectors in Africa that supply Zoo's with their wild animals.  The group led by John Wayne are joined by a female photographer to work beside them in catching animals for a particular Zoo.  She will fall in love with John Wayne in the process and gets in trouble with baby Elephants along the way.  One of the better scenes in the movie is Red Buttons character setting a rocket system to catch monkeys, launching it and then talking about it later.  In Harm's Way is based off a book by the same title set during WW2 in which Wayne plays the lead character with a good ensemble cast that includes Kirk Douglas.  This is loosely based on the Guadalcanal/Solomons fighting.",1335312000,21,1232,4.392070484581498

If you are even looking at this Video then I imagine you are a  ""Duke"" Wayne fan. This disc has three of his
famous movies on it. Donovan's Reef is a well known trip into paradise, Hatari is just plain John Wayne
thrills and adventure, and  In Harm's Way is one of his WW2 classics. No matter how many times I have seen
In Harm's Way I still get butterflies in my stomach while watching.

Classics, Classics, Classics. John Wayne at his best.

Get this Video, buy chips, dips, and drinks, invite some friends over and you will have a real great classic
movie night. Everyone has seen these movies yet everyone will be silent during parts of these movies
as they remember their favorite parts.

2789483,5,B000O179GI,"The John Wayne Adventure Collection is a great set of movies for any fan of The Duke's non-western films, with four of his most popular titles plus the collector's edition of Island in the Sky.  Since you can easily find reviews for the individual movies, I'll confine my comments to the value of this box set, other than to say again that The High and the Mighty, Donovan's Reef, Hatari, and In Harm's Way are all very popular John Wayne movies.  Just check some customer reviews on different sites and you'll see that a large majority of people give them five stars.

As for this set, it's an excellent value if you want all five of these movies in your collection.  A few minutes of searching will tell you that In Harm's Way, Hatari, and Donovan's Reef are not exactly easy to find new at a decent price.  I've been keeping track recently trying to decide what to buy, and those three DVD's have cost consistently around $20 each, sometimes more for In Harm's Way and Hatari.  The five movies separately always add up to about $80, maybe a little more.  New copies of the Adventure Collection are usually available for $60 or less, so this really is a good deal if you want all five.

The only other small detail is that even though the five movies are on their own discs, they come in three thin-size cases.  In Harm's Way and Island in the Sky (collector's edition) are in the same case, as are Donovan's Reef and Hatari.  The High and the Mighty is a two-disc collector's edition, and is the only one with its own case.  If you can live without having each movie individually packaged, you'll probably appreciate the savings of this box set.  The original movies and DVD special features are all intact.",1306800000,6,1710,4.516233766233766
