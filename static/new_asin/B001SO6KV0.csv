Maya herself visits and talks about several places around Moscow that feature prominently in the book.

The focus is primarily on Plisetskayas stories and memories, but there are some brief clips of some of her best known roles. The core of the movie for me, though, is a Swan Lake coaching session with Paris Op&eacute;ra Ballet members. Maya works with a dancer, who later became an &Eacute;toile, on Odile and then with two younger dancers on the Act II pas de deux. I don't think theres any better way to see how Plisetskaya transformed ballet with her technique, artistry, and stagecraft than by watching her critique and teach dancers trained in a different tradition.

Four stars, keeping in mind this is not a performance video (try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swan-Lake/dp/B0000YEDLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swan Lake </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stars-of-the-Russian-Ballet-Vol-1/dp/B001PLOMFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stars of the Russian Ballet, Vol. 1 </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stars-of-the-Russian-Ballet-Vol-2/dp/B001PMZK70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stars of the Russian Ballet, Vol. 2 </a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stars-of-the-Russian-Ballet-Kultur/dp/B00197YZAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stars of the Russian Ballet (Kultur) </a>&nbsp;if you want to see Maya dancing in her prime).",1499299200,,1756,8.335106382978724

8340027,5,B001SO6KV0,"Interesting background information into one of Soviet Union's greatest dancers.
There are fascinating clips to prove that, even by today's standards, this was
a phenomenal talent.  Maya appears in person to talk about her life and career.
Filmed in monochrome with subtitles serving as translation for the Russian and
French, it is a wonderful addition to any ballet enthusiasts collection which
would still interest those who enjoy  Russian ballet.",1376092800,,449,5.492753623188406
8340028,4,B001SO6KV0,"I gave this video a 4 star only because this is a subtitled documentary and is mostly in French and Russian. I understand Russian so it was a pleasure to hear it again. This is for the true balletomane who wants to know about her personal life. It is NOT a compilation of her dances. So if you are looking for a video of her dances this is NOT for you. However, it does reveal her struggles as an artist in a repressive regime. Astounding talent who survived against a constant struggle during the Soviet years. We, as her admirers, knew nothing about her difficult life.",1360972800,3,571,4.39622641509434
