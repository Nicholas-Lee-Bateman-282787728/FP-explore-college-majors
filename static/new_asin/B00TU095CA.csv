7022570,5,B00TU095CA,"This DVD set is a great mix for all aquarium fans. There are colorful freshwater aquariums, tropical fish tanks and a good insight into the underwater world. I have really enjoyed the freshwater aquariums with their brilliant colors, but also the tropical reef with its many small fish is very nice to look at. On the DVD there's also an underwater film with various unusual fish, the seahorses I have liked most. You can also choose between six aquariums, there are beautiful corals and colorful fish. You can choose between different background sounds, music and natural sounds of the ocean can be selected. In the DVD set, the perspectives are very fit and the picture quality is excellent. These DVDs provide a relaxing atmosphere into your living room. I really enjoy watching these DVDs.",1429660800,2,793,4.925373134328358
7022571,5,B00TU095CA,"A definite 5 star set!  There are a lot of aquarium DVDs around - this is one of the best ones - First the Freshwater and Tropical Aquarium - - the difference between the tropical and freshwater fish and backgrounds are striking. The fish in both have vivid colors and the tracks are long enough and different enough - it keeps you watching. It has water sounds as well as music (which is really nice). I decided to try both and neither too. The photography on both discs is, as usual, excellent. If you like watching fish, you'll love this DVD. Second - the Tropical Reef and Natures Aquarium - another great DVD if you're a fan of fish, coral, and beauty. As with the other disc, there are a LOT of varieties of fish and attractions such as the always mesmerizing jellyfish and lacy seahorses as well. I was amazed at all the different creatures in these DVDS. My very favorite part of this disc would have to be the Reef Film.  I own quite a few ocean/fish videos - this set is one of the best! Absolutely outstanding!",1428710400,5,1021,4.368421052631579

8703089,5,B00TU095CA,"This is an amazingly beautiful set of HD high quality DVDs.  If you enjoy the ocean, coral, colorful fish and sea creatures, you will love this set.  It is professionally filmed.  My favorite of the pair is the Tropical Freshwater Aquarium DVD.  It gives you five different sound options from a tropical rain forest to bubbles.  The colors and scene choices offer a wide variety for viewing.  All the scenes loop for continuous play or they may be looped together for non interrupted viewing of the whole DVD.
The other DVD is also lovely and offers a lovely coral reef scene or a choice of six other tropical aquarium scenes.  Each scene is colorful, high quality HD and sound, and has a choice of sound options from soft music to nature sounds.  There is also a wide variety of fish, ocean creatures and backgrounds.  No shaking or poor quality filming.  This is a great set for aquarium lovers.  Very relaxing.",1434585600,7,913,4.64375
