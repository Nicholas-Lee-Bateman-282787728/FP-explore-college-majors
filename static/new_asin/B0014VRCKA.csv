8256480,4,B0014VRCKA,"No, this is not the hard-driven rock & roll we've seen from Martin with The Tea Party, but instead you get a feast of diverse musical experiences here. The exotic musical influences he weaved into his music before now come front & center as he he expands upon an Eastern musical journey. He's a great front man & this is a fine display of his talents. Also a bonus is the fact you don't get the frenetic editing pace so often found in concert videos, it could be slower yet for my tastes but it's nowhere near as choppy as you seem to get most times. Two thumbs up!",1370044800,,565,4.192660550458716
