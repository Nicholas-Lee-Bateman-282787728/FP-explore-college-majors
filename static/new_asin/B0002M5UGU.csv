Still haven't watched the other movie and don't know what it's about or anything but The Hogfather is a great adaptation of the novel.",1403481600,5,259,4.531914893617022

2104008,5,B0002M5UGU,"Terry Pratchett's Hogfather is a wonderful almost christmas like tale about someone trying to stop the belief of everyone so that the hog father will pass from memory and then the people will be easy to control, with no imagination. I won't spoil it for you, but I love this movie and watch it every year at Christmas time.",1397520000,9,323,4.491525423728813

2104011,5,B0002M5UGU,Mystery and explaination lies in wait for you in the these Two movies.  Take a walk on the wildside. I did and Absolutely Loved every minute of it.,1394236800,,147,4.25

2104013,4,B0002M5UGU,"I didn't watch ""Snow Queen"" at all. For some reason this combo DVD was cheaper than just ""Hogfather"" alone. I enjoy the movie and was glad to show it to my family. It's definitely a fun, off-the-wall, fantasy Christmas movie.",1389139200,14,225,4.65
2104014,5,B0002M5UGU,"Assuming you are looking for the Russian animated (1957), dubbed into English version featuring the voices of Sandra Dee and Tommy Kirk, preceded by a live action introduction featuring Art Linkletter, the one that used to play so often on TV in pre-VCR days, that is.  This version still sends shivers down my spine with its incredibly moving depiction of heroine Gerda's unstoppable quest to free her playmate Kay from the Snow Queen's clutches, a dedication that inspires almost everyone (and everything) she meets into similar efforts to help her.  If you ever saw it, you know this; if you never saw it, you owe yourself (and your children) a viewing.

The good news is that you've found it right here, along with several public domain Christmas features of varying quality but similar (largely poor) condition.  Of these the most interesting are several amazing toy commercials (Roger Maris plugging his own toy baseball game, a Gilbert American Flyer electric train set of interchangeable modules, the famous Mattel Blaze rocking horse, etc.), the (1959) Soviet ""Santa Visits Antarctica"" notable for avoiding all mention of Christmas as required by law in the Soviet original (which the English dub put right back in), the (1947) ""Santa's Surprise"" that introduced the character of Little Audrey along with a decidedly NON-PC cast of ethnic and national stereotyped children determined to give Santa the present of tidying up his home, and the (1936) Max Fleischer short ""Christmas Comes But Once a Year"" in which a wacky inventor saves Christmas for a bunch of orphans by building ridiculously elaborate toys out of common household items, notable for the first pictorial depiction I know of, of the as yet still imaginary device for getting husbands to do more housework:

the riding vacuum.

Note: If you just want the Snow Queen, essentially identical versions are available from Osiris Entertainment (2009):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B00394DW2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>&nbsp;and Westlake Entertainment Group (2004):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B0006HU2X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>, except that the Osiris version comes in a proper DVD box, not a flimsy cardboard sleeve.

(Amazon has unfortunately grouped together the reviews of several different versions of The Snow Queen so before purchasing make sure to follow the links provided in this review in order to get the version you actually want.)

The bad news is that the print is in pretty sad shape: scratched, spliced, and so dark that the nighttime scenes are all but invisible.  The soundtrack also has a lot of glitches, but wait, there's more.

The good news is that the film was recently restored, and this Films by Jove (2006) version is available here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen-Golden-Antelope-Bench-Cyclist-Fence/dp/B001F0KBU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen - Golden Antelope - Bench - Cyclist - Fence</a>&nbsp;along with four other animated films also directed by Lev Atamanov with the original Russian soundtracks and English subtitles.  Although the restoration isn't as perfect as you might have expected these days, the biggest improvement is that the nighttime scenes are quite clearly visible in their entirety.

The bad news is that the English dubbed soundtrack was NOT made available, not even as an option!  IMHO this was an inexcusable lapse, particularly given the concerns of those involved over income being lost to public domain editions like the one I'm recommending instead.  Well, if they'd had the sense to include the English dubbed soundtrack (preferably restored), along with the Art Linkletter intro, the montage accompanying Sandra Dee's song ""Do It While You're Young"", and the English Opening and Closing Credits with the title song (all preferably restored) as options, who would buy a PD version ever again?  Now, anyone looking for the version they remember has no choice but to do so!

Discotek Media was faced with a similar problem when they reissued a trio of Japanese animated classics that also used to play regularly on TV in Fred Ladd English dubbed versions:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.  Besides offering the original Japanese soundtracks with subtitles, they also give you the option of watching the pristine restored film prints with restored versions of the old English dubbed soundtracks.  Only a fool would buy a public domain or pirated version of these films now!

Note: If, like me, you were a little surprised when you first learned that this film was Russian not Japanese animation, it turns out there just might be a reason.  It seems that a young Japanese animator who was discouraged and ready to quit and do something else went to see this film in a theater and came out truly re-inspired.  The name of this young man whose future animation work was almost lost forever?

Hayao Miyazaki.

That's why his Studio Ghibli has released a DVD of the restored version with Japanese subtitles here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B0015U3N2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>.

Note: The 2-disc version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fairytale-Adventures/dp/B003NFM3UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fairytale Adventures</a>&nbsp;from TGG Direct, the one that says ""9 Hours of Animated Films"" on the cover, turns out to contain a different print of this film on its second disc, without the Linkletter intro, without the annoying audio and video glitch at the beginning, but also without the entire sequence with the robbers!  Not recommended.",1387756800,7,6371,6.2786697247706424
2104015,1,B0002M5UGU,"This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. I rented it in hopes that it was the version of the Snow Queen that they always used to play on television. It's not. THAT version was an absolutely beautiful piece of work. This version is the most insipid thing I've ever had the misfortune to view. Whoever did this took the original story by Hans Christian Anderson (who I can just FEEL turning over in his grave) and turned it into a fairy tale just like the other hundred or so that have been released for children on video. The attempts at characterization are laughable, as are the ""villains""-- the snow queen wants to take ""her"" mirror and block out the sun, so that the world will be ICE and so that no one will be able to think. The old evil witch-lady (who was just *lonely* in the original) wants Ellie's heart so that she can be young forever <yawn> Heard this all before, thanks. The music... Well, I won't elaborate on that. I tried my personal best to block it out. Don't rent this, unless you really want something to make fun of. That is all it's good for.",999907200,3,1075,4.326732673267327

2104079,4,B0002M5UGU,"I bought this for Snow Queen since it was half the price to buy it with Hogfather than it was to buy it alone. And I'm glad I did. To be honest I was pretty disappointed in Snow Queen-- it has a lame, lackluster, and overly long script that limped along so severely I couldn't actually tell if the actors could act, BUT it had some interesting and lovely ideas, a couple beautiful sets, and is the only Snow Queen I've seen or read that links Hans Christian Andersen's beloved but disjointed story together in a seamless tale of wonder, even if poorly executed. For the ideas alone, I'm glad I got it. But it absolutely did not need to be 3 hours long. I watched The Hogfather only because it was there and was pleasantly surprised. The assassin Mr. Teatime got pretty annoying, but the rest of the story was so typically and delightfully Terry Pratchett and a lot of fun to watch. I will probably watch it every Christmas. The sets alone were amazing, beautiful, and utterly fantastic. A couple plot holes, sure, but in such a ridiculous place as Discworld, things that don't make sense are to be expected. :)",1420243200,7,1110,4.472906403940887

2104082,5,B0002M5UGU,"As so many others, I got this for the Hogfather DVD; I haven't even gotten around to watching The Snow Queen yet but I plan on fixing that soon. I caught Hogfather on Netflix a few years back, and fell in love with Disc World. This is hands down one of my favorite Christmas movies and one of my favorite overall movies/series. It turned me on to reading the Disc World books, which it amazed me that I missed this series when I was a teen, because I was deeply in love with The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy when I was a kid - this is kinda like the flip coin of THGTTG but in fantasy rather than sci-fi. The absurdity, cheeky witticisms, and delightful characters are just lovely! If you liked Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, etc....this may be right up your alley.

I bought two copies of this for Christmas, one as a gift for myself, and the other as a gift for my dad. I played the DVD for the family for this Christmas, and everyone enjoyed it (keep in mind, we're a pretty nerdy family). I'm planning on buying some additional copies for my nieces, and I can't wait till my nephew gets a bit older so I can share this with him, too.",1419465600,10,1142,4.238532110091743
2104083,5,B0002M5UGU,"I love the Hogfather and was really disappointed when it was taken off netflix instant play. For whatever reason it's cheaper to buy Hogfather with Snow Queen. Ive never watched the Snow Queen and don't know if I will ever, but whatever. It could suck (which from other people's reviews some think that it does), but it's a free movie when you buy the Hogfather for the cheapest price around.",1419379200,,392,4.614285714285714

2104085,5,B0002M5UGU,I got this for the Hogfather film which came bundled with the Snow Queen.  The Hogfather is a wonderful film that gets the Commonsense Media seal of approval - a must in my book.  The Snow Queen I would pass on but is okay.,1416355200,,223,4.045454545454546

2104095,5,B0002M5UGU,"I loved the Terry Pratchet books and movies. They are very witty and fun for any lover of the fantastic.

8029124,5,B0002M5UGU,"Hogfather is great.  Snow Queen comes along for the ride.

Michelle Dockery, who plays Susan is to die for.  (Especially since she's ""Death's"" granddaughter!)

Too bad about ""Snow Queen"" being only marginal.  Bridget Fonda is a personal favorite.

DVD product is fine.",1504656000,,268,5.261904761904762
8029125,5,B0002M5UGU,"Not so much of a fan for the Snow Queen, but the Hogfather is a wonderful movie to watch if you like different references to other movies and weird outlook on what world Terry Prachett created. Always enjoyed his movies and hope to collect every one of them. In Texas, theres almost no good story based British movies around. Without amazon I wouldn't have been able to find it in store.",1501459200,,387,4.464788732394366
