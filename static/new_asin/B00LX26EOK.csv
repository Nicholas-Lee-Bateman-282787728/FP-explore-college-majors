6509143,5,B00LX26EOK,"The final season of 'Arctic Air' was most notable, in my opinion, for two reasons: It's final two episodes were among the best pieces of action and drama I have seen in more than 50 years of watching television programming and the emotional content of all the scripts was top notch.
For those that don't know, the late and much-lamented 'Arctic Air' series revolved around the day-to-day lives of the quirky men and women running a small airline in northwest Canada. The airline was on the verge of bankruptcy during Season One when Bobby Martin, a successful venture capitalist who had been living and working in Vancouver, arrived on the scene to attend the wedding of his niece. His father, a legendary bush pilot, had co-founded the airline with Mel Iverson, who took it over when Bobby's father died in a plane crash. When Bobby learns that the business is in trouble he decides to stay and see what he can do to help save it. Bobby and Iverson's daughter Krista take over the day-to-day operation of the airline at the end of Season Two and in Season Three they are turning its finances around with aggressive business tactics.
Make no mistake, however, 'Arctic Air' is not about balance sheets and number crunching: It is a series that features hair-raising adventures, some endearing characters and some of Canada's best writers, actors and directors. If you like action, you'll find plenty of it in this really excellent Canadian series that ended all too soon when Ottawa bureaucrats slashed the CBC's budget and forced its cancellation.
In Season Three Bobby (played by Adam Beach) and Krista (played by Pascale Hutton) are trying to run the business while dealing with the end of their romantic relationship and the fact that she has a new man in her life. I won't say more about that because that might spoil it for those of you who have never seen this show. Suffice it to say that there are some very poignant scenes featuring the two of them. There are, additionally, other romantic entanglements on the show featuring other characters and an ongoing feud between Bobby and a former friend who is now running a shady trucking company, all of which lead to some very compelling scenes.
The action builds throughout the season until the climactic two-part conclusion. Again, no spoilers here but if you like high octane action then you're going to love these two episodes.
This was an excellent series that, in addition to its wonderful scripts and fine portrayals, gave First Nations actors and writers the opportunity to really show off their dramatic skills while dealing with contemporary issues including the environmental deterioration of Canada's northern territories by corporate interests. I, for one, wish it had survived the bureaucratic chopping block.",1427068800,6,2778,4.938034188034188

Daring and dangerous search and rescue flights, last minute evacuations of whole communities, aiding police on manhunts and dropping makeshift bombs to divert flooding rivers are a few of the action story lines contained in this season of Arctic Air.",1456963200,,475,5.012658227848101
