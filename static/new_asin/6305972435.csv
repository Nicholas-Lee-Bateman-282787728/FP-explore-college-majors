7898504,1,6305972435,"Be careful; If you're looking for Yellow Pages (1988) aka ""Going Undercover"" with Lea Thompson and Chris Lemmon, that movie is NOT available on dvd.  The dvd being sold by numerous sellers on Amazon is actually Yellow Pages (1996) starring Sam Taft, Laura Kelly and Sean Murphy.  Same title, different movie.",1169424000,8,308,5.019607843137255
7898505,1,6305972435,"Completed in 1984 but not released until four years after, this English production offers little of value. Apparently designed to be a pastiche of the hard boiled detective category of cinema, the work features Chris Lemmon as Henry Brilliant, ineffective private investigator who finds difficulty in obtaining employment other than locating lost pets. His luck appears to improve when wealthy Maxine de la Hunt (Jean Simmons) allegedly selects him directly from his advertisement in telephone yellow pages and offers Henry $2000 per week plus expenses to serve as bodyguard for her stepdaughter Marigold (Lea Thompson) during a European travel junket for coeds. Marigold takes an immediate dislike to her chaperone while Henry's attempts to gain her approval meet with expected rebuffs. The arrangement becomes increasingly complex as a number of subplots appear, silly for the most part. Opening segments are laden with hopelessly unfunny slapstick following which elements of suspense are awakened from the scenario albeit with scant success. Dangerous adventures lack meaning to a viewer when a production fails to provide a sense of purpose, as in this instance. A motif of scientific espionage involving Marigold's father appears but its connection to the remainder of the storyline is put to bed by heavy cutting. Originally titled YELLOW PAGES, released with that name in the United Kingdom and upon the Continent, this weak effort is known as GOING UNDERCOVER in the United States, where it ostensibly has acquired a minor cult following, although one wonders why, as there is minimal wit or imagination to be found in it. Simmons, billed first, is as polished as ever, but Lemmon and Thompson are given the greatest amount of screen time with Lemmon rather charismatic when he is able to avoid the mugging that tarnished his father Jack's performances. Direction is largely pedestrian with no apparent point of view. The majority of the film's drawbacks follow from the director's own script that bounces about in a generally fatuous manner amid themes of comedy, suspense, satire, et alia. However, contributions that are all one might wish are made by cinematographer John Coquillon and also by Moss Mabry for his tasteful costumes, notably those created for Simmons. Opening action is shot in Burbank, the west San Fernando Valley and Bel Air, all in southern California, with most scenes filmed in Copenhagen with a climax in that city's Tivoli Gardens, a wide transmission of locales for a movie suffering from choppy editing, creating a perception that the director/screenwriter has no firm idea as to what sort of picture he is after making.",1131062400,,2658,5.241784037558685
7898506,2,6305972435,"It is quite obvious that ""Going Undercover"" was not a box office hit and rightly so. The movie holds your interest at first but then the plot gets lame shortly after. The script is weak and so is the performance of the actors. Lea Thompson did not do a good job playing Merrigold. (What kind of a name is Merrigold)? I have seen Lea Thompson in much better movies than this one.",1030492800,,378,4.263888888888889
7898507,5,6305972435,"When you watch Sam Taft in the role of the stumbling, bumbling, good-guy-without-a-clue Al Baxter, you can't help but wonder why Jim Carrey has all the money. Taft's deadpan, underplayed humor is an absolute scream to watch. I laughed out loud several times while watching this hilarious film, and I'm the type of guy that usually says, ""Oh yeah, that's kinda funny,"" while viewing movies that make the average person howl and cry and roll around on the floor gasping for breath.
This is the kind of film you should watch whenever your spirits are at their lowest -- it's an instant cure for the blues.
-- Look for character actor Chris Ullman in the role of the mysterious, wacked-out FBI agent, Mr. X, in the infamous park bench meeting with the clueless Al Baxter (Sam Taft).
Ullman should be arrested -- for scene stealing.
I would have given this film a six-star rating, but you only let us go up to five!",1027123200,2,910,4.588957055214724
