5563243,2,B00B8O4WPG,A lot of dancing which I really don't care for.  The quality of the DVD and the music is horrible.,1423094400,,98,3.9
5563244,5,B00B8O4WPG,"The Fat Burning Workout is the only one worth doing, but it is worth it. I used this workout in the early 90s and it worked for me. But life happened and I stopped doing it. Years later I was looking to get in shape and tried a Kathy Smith Step Workout, but it was too much for me. I remembered this workout and ordered it. What is great about this is it is low-impact and able to be modified (increasing the intensity as you get stronger). I can feel myself getting stronger but have never been in pain the next day. This is a great workout for beginner/intermediate.",1421971200,4,568,4.220183486238532
5563245,5,B00B8O4WPG,Such a great deal that I had to take advantage of! I was looking for just one of the workouts to replace the VHS I once had & got two more with this great combo! Kathy Smith is one of the best video instructors & is great with her instructions. I will always recommend her workouts to others!,1421020800,3,292,4.051724137931035
5563246,3,B00B8O4WPG,The moves aren't that easy to follow. But the way of working out all the body was very satisfying. And the video was quite entertaining!,1406332800,,136,4.48
5563247,5,B00B8O4WPG,Been using this workout for 20 years.  The best.,1404950400,2,48,4.333333333333333
5563248,5,B00B8O4WPG,"I love her fat burning workout, which is included on this DVD.  It is my absolute favorite workout of all time because it gets such great results.",1389139200,2,146,4.407407407407407
5563249,4,B00B8O4WPG,"I discovered Kathy Smith's videos in the late 1980s when I was in my mid-forties. I'm now in my mid-sixties and still work out to her and others' videos. I once owned all three of the workouts featured in this ""Timeless"" series. The ""Fat-Burning"" video was an all-time favorite of mine; I literally wore it out after about six years of playing it. I still love it today, can still do it, and am so glad to have it again on DVD. As for the other two workouts on this DVD, ""Body Basics"" was not a favorite of mine back in the '80s, but I have gained a new appreciation of it today. The floor work--especially for the legs--is terrific!

The ""Winning Workout"" is okay, but even in the old days I found the weight-lifting portion too convoluted, with all its graduated phases. Plus, it moves too fast for me. Kathy has newer videos that offer far better weight-training segments in my opinion. So, now that I'm twenty years older, I have even less reason to revisit the Winning Workout, and probably won't.

In my opinion, it is the Fat-Burning workout that makes this DVD worth the money. Looking back, I think it was Kathy Smith's first mature video. She dropped the Farrah Fawcett image that characterized both Body Basics and the Winning Workout. Instead, her sexy Barbie Doll look was replaced by a more athletic, health-conscious Kathy, sporting a practical pony tail and no longer wearing pantyhose under her leotard. To me, she even looks more muscular. Also, 25 minutes of aerobics was expanded to 40 minutes. No floor work, but lots of aerobics, and at a slower, exceptionally well-queued pace.

In sum, I would say this DVD offers one great workout(Fat Burning), one very good one (Body Basics), and one good one (Winning Workout) It's well worth the price; plus, it's fun to have a blast from the past, complete with purple, hot pink, and turquoise colors all combined in the same outfit.",1375056000,20,1896,4.6537313432835825
5563250,5,B00B8O4WPG,"I love working out at home to videos. I have a nice collection, but Kathy Smith's videos have always been my favorite. She's taken her great 1980's classics and FINALLY put them on DVD! This one includes my all time favorite, The Fat Burning Workout. I was finally able to part with my worn out VHS version. I LOVE this collection!",1369267200,6,331,4.442622950819672
5563251,3,B00B8O4WPG,Did the Fat Burning workout when it was on VHS.  Then it was 60 minutes long WHEW! Now it is edited to 40 minutes and much more practical for over 50.  Be warned the Body Basics workout and Winning Workout are high impact with muscle bound young males and young females performing.  Under the winning workout can use some of the weight lifting methods.,1368921600,4,352,4.46875
5563252,5,B00B8O4WPG,I'm so glad Kathy Smith brought these oldies but goodies back!! They were great in the '80s and they are just as effective today. Love them!!,1448150400,,141,4.461538461538462
5563253,5,B00B8O4WPG,"Excellent. ""Timeless"".",1444780800,,22,10.5
5563254,4,B00B8O4WPG,I used this in the 1980's.  I loved it then because it didn't try to break a body part off in the name of 'fitness'.  I bought it again because I remembered that.  Still find the fat burning workout a VERY valuable tool.  It helped me lose 30 pounds then and I use it as a supplemental workout on the days I want a little more in my routine.,1442361600,5,341,3.898550724637681
5563255,5,B00B8O4WPG,"The Fat Burning Workout is by far my favorite.  This workout has truly been ""timeless"" for me, as I have been doing this workout for over 2 decades!  Many may say it is outdated, but it is a CLASSIC for me and still gets the job done, i.e.: fat loss.  Well done Kathy, you are an inspiration!  I would love to know where the other exercisers in the Fat Burning workout are today? Seems like we've been workout buddies for years, LOL!",1441670400,3,433,4.2439024390243905

5563257,5,B00B8O4WPG,Great complete overall workout collection.  I have  loved Kathy Smith for years and glad you can still get her older workouts.,1431561600,,126,4.9523809523809526

5563261,3,B00B8O4WPG,"I love Kathy Smith but this wasn't the cardio workout I was looking for - aka good old aerobics - but more of moderate intensity timing workouts. If that's what you're looking for, the exercises are great and the price can't be beat.",1427673600,,233,4.441860465116279
8564185,5,B00B8O4WPG,"I found the workouts fun enjoyed them a lot. The floor workouts  a little difficult for me, but floor work outs were never my strongest points. I am 68 years old. I plan on buying more of her DVD. Erlinda",1516406400,,204,4.1
8564186,5,B00B8O4WPG,I am so happy they have this classic! The fat burning aerobic workout is the best/most effective/easy to modify movements/and fun workout video I've ever done. I used to have this on VHS so was very happy to find it on DVD!,1512000000,,223,4.333333333333333
8564187,5,B00B8O4WPG,Call me old school but this was one of my favorite workouts as a teenager and I still love her amazing fat burning workouts.,1493942400,,124,4.208333333333333
8564188,3,B00B8O4WPG,My mom and me love doing the Kathy Smith workout videos when it is too gross to get outside. This one we thought would be fun. I didn't mind the workout but the breakdowns where awful and I thought the video poorly showed you what they where doing. Not my favorite out of the Kathy Smith collection.,1489708800,,299,4.2631578947368425
8564189,5,B00B8O4WPG,"Just did the fat burning portion this morning, and it is my favorite.  I have been waiting for it to be put on DVD.  I had a vh copy",1464825600,,132,3.5172413793103448

8564193,5,B00B8O4WPG,"I first did the fat burning workout on video 15 years ago, always wanted the DVD, was so excited to get this - Kathy is the best fitness instructor ever, her workouts suit all levels of ability and make you feel good about yourself!",1454716800,,232,4.295454545454546
8564194,5,B00B8O4WPG,Love love love all three of these classic workouts. You will work up a good sweat. These were my go to workout back in the late 80's early 90's and I am so happy that I was able to find this on DVD.,1451001600,,198,3.627906976744186
