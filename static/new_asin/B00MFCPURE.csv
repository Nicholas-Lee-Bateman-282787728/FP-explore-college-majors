6576075,3,B00MFCPURE,I'm curious if this set includes the 3D version of the final film.,1408060800,2,66,4.153846153846154
6576076,5,B00MFCPURE,"For the saw movies, it seems every other one was good. But they tied up all the loose ends. I thought the ending was great, cause I always wondered what happened to the dr. From saw 1.going to sell my saw dvds and buy this instead!!",1407888000,3,232,4.065217391304348
6576077,5,B00MFCPURE,It about time they coming out for the hold set i been waiting for this to happen anyway's sense U.K. already have they own Saw complete Movie Collection set in there own country now we got our's :),1407715200,,197,4.2105263157894735
6576078,5,B00MFCPURE,"This thing is cheap as hell and would already cost you less than just buying two Saw movies. I'm only a fan of the first three (the trilogy that was originally intended before it became a cash cow franchise). You'd be dumb not to buy this, unless you already own them, and it'll probably look neat as a collector's item. Already determined to buy this soon!",1407628800,6,357,4.424242424242424
6576079,4,B00MFCPURE,Saw the complete set on blu ray is going to okay if your a fan of the movies. But I'm not that into the saw movies don't get me wrong i love horror movies but i never really saw a on these movies at the movies except for part 4 and it was awesome i also like part 2 and part 1 plus i love the games. so if your a saw fan then pick this up when it comes i mean you can't go wrong for 23 bucks.,1407628800,,392,3.4157303370786516
6576080,4,B00MFCPURE,"I am judging solely at this point on the contents, and the value of the set. Just under 20 bucks for SEVEN films, even if a few do fall a bit short (to me the only ones that truly disappoint in the series are the 5th, which to me was a minor stumble and the fatal stumble in the final entry).

I do feel a bit disappointed that they are cramming ALL seven films onto 3 Blu-ray discs, but doing away with the R-rated cuts in favor of the UNRATED ones. But I am assuming in the trade off one of the discs will actually hold three films, and it does leave precious little rooms for any of the bonus content of the previous discs.

Honestly if the set were at 40 with 7 discs, I would consider it quite a bargain. I can only hope that the set is as good an experience as New Line's Nightmare on Elm St. set which while it may have been less consistent in quality (even while Saw might not have been amazing or great film making, the quality between entries of the Nightmare series was very erratic much like the Friday the 13th series. I felt even at its worst the Saw series only made a major fumble in its last entry.

I'll be back in September to update the review as I am sure I'll be buying this as I have only the last entry on Blu-ray (the previous I had gotten on dvd). So even without the extras the price value alone for the entire series is hard to pass up.",1407542400,19,1364,4.025830258302583
6576081,5,B00MFCPURE,Wow all 7 movies for $18(or at least at the time of this review.)?!!!? Id be a sucker not to buy this. And it comes with Digital HD which i believe is like ultraviolet. I hope this isn't a bad product because 18 bucks for seven films is too good to be true.,1407542400,6,257,3.8679245283018866

6576099,1,B00MFCPURE,This might seem harsh because I like the movies but this collections is a joke.  Yes it has the 5 movies but it only includes dolby digital audio with all of the films and apparently just to rub it in your face they do include DTS 5.1 and DTS 7.1 test tracks on the 3rd disc just so you can make sure your system can play the audio that you should have gotten with this collection.  If you care about the audio at all then you're better off watching for the individual movies to go on sale.,1524441600,,490,4.041237113402062

6576152,5,B00MFCPURE,"These are the BEST horror movies I have ever seen!  I don't know if I would even call them horror films because they are so much more than guts and gore. They are movies that keep you on the edge of you seat at all times, but not because they are scary...it is because they are so suspenseful and you can't wait to see what will happen next!  My nine year old son watched them with me and did not find them scary at all.  There is A LOT of blood and guts and it can be really gross, but not something that gives you nightmares at the end of the night!  For those that have a weak stomach and have a problem seeing blood/guts or watching someone get cut open, this movie is not for you!! But I guarantee you that at at the end of each movie your mouth will be dropped open in shock of how each movie comes together at the end.....and all the movies tie together and they are constantly revisiting old character and events from prior movies so you will want to watch each movie pretty close together and not put too much of a time span in between each movie so it is easier to remember what happened!  I don't know what else to say but the person that wrote these movies is brilliant.....or very very twisted!!  lol.  Either way, I love all the Saw movies.....none of them disappointed me!",1518393600,,1287,4.186234817813765

When I naught this set, I was hoping to have all of them, 1-8 but as it was, I only got 1-7. Ive seen them all before and I love how it plays out. I also am very happy with the set I have now, as it is a prized possession to me.",1517875200,,514,3.6818181818181817

I have two random movies of the series Saw and Saw 5. So when I Saw I could either get Saw one for $10 or the whole set, I got the whole set. I didn't see the review that mentioned the audio. Little disappointed that all they give you is Dolby Digital 5.1 for each movie. If you bought them individually you would get the DTS HD Master Audio and some in 6.1 and 7.1 surround sound. These movies have great surround sound, disappointed with not include any HD sound formats. Pretty much you are getting 1080p video, but DVD quality sound. But at $11, its not bad. I should have had to spend $10 each around $70 for a series that I don't think is worth that much.

6576232,5,B00MFCPURE,"This series is multi level horror

Each chapter provides powerful psychological torture and excruciating physical torture.  The setting is always one to alarm and unnerve the victims.

Jigsaw is responsible for many deaths.  His games are lethal, but he's never actually killed anyone.  His games target his victims minds.  He anticipates how his victims will react and causes them to destroy themselves or each other.  Still each step of the games has a way to survive, each tests his victims will to survive/live.  But most prove willing to either die or kill, rather than make the right choice.

 The greatest horror of this series is that it's not just mind games being played on the characters.  Each chapter is a mind game for the audience.  Each movie has the audience convinced they know what's happening.  Viewers are anticipating a climax only to have something completely different happen.  Each finale is a powerful, terrifying, exhilarating, shocking event.",1507075200,,970,5.134615384615385

6576250,3,B00MFCPURE,"Included is all 7 movies in the Saw franchise and at the current price, that's about 2 bucks a movie.

The movies come in a standard size Blu-ray case across 3 discs. That's two per disc with Saw III - V sharing one disc so these aren't going to be benchmark quality movies, but it's the best quality currently available and a step up from the DVD releases. There's a bit of digital noise present in the video.

The menu is bare bones and the same for each disc. There are no chapter menus with thumbnails.

Every movie in this collection is presented with standard Dolby Digital 5.1, not utilizing advanced audio encoding such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio. Heck, even the DVDs had Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES formats. It's interesting though that parts 5 onwards have Dolby Digital Plus on the digital copies.

You won't find any of the special features on these discs. However included is a code for digital copies of all of the movies with bonus features from the previous DVD releases included on Vudu. The presentation of these bonus features could be better as every featurette is played back to back in one video with no chapters to find specific special features.

Both the Blu-rays and digital copies are the unrated editions with extended gore scenes. It's worth noting that the alternate director's cut of Saw III is not included, nor is any of its few exclusive special features.

In the end, it's a huge bargain and it's shortcomings can be overlooked due to this. For the price, I say pick it up if you enjoy the movies.",1502755200,4,1544,4.576086956521739

6576265,4,B00MFCPURE,"saw (2004). nice, stripped down intro to the series, cary elwes and leigh wannel play it beautifully. found myself digging the challenges faced by the characters. also, jigsaw's intentions are somewhat...noble? pleasantly surprised.

saw 2 (2005). slightly altering the format, i dug how saw 2 pits a group against jigsaw's traps and moral conundrums. i've always loved shawnee smith, so it was nice to see her role expand. and donnie wahlberg, he of new kids on the block fame, not bad. and always nice to see dina ""dizzy"" meyer.

saw 3 (2006). despite an over-abundance of flashbacks, i might have liked this one the best, and it (seemingly) wraps up a nice arch throughout the first three movies. more delightfully inventive traps and dilemma's. again, despite the bad name these movies get (i loathe the term torture porn, and hey, no coincidence that these flicks and hostel rose to prominence during w's torture happy response to terrorism. again, horror is just reflecting our own horror back at us), saw 3 is essentially asking us to rethink our deeply held feelings about vengeance. also, this movie is excruciating and refreshingly bracing with its' violence. i cringed early and often.

i also really enjoyed saw 4 and 5. both make steady, game attempts at furthering the story, and saw 4 in particular is a definite mindXXXX at times. there's sincere effort to keep the story moving organically, while doing little ret-cons and add-ons to the past. it works nicely. i also hafta say, saws 3-5 are more excruciating then its' two predecessors.

saw 6 (2009). more folks get exactly what they deserve as john kramer continues to play games from beyond the grave. shawnee smith shows up for some newly filmed flashbacks, which is refreshing, because flashbacks from previous films were really being overused. solid entertainment with excellent production values. i give them credit, the story moves forward and some of the traps still manage to elicit legit excruciating revulsion.

saw 7: the final chapter (2010). man, i gotta say this is a series that never forgets its' characters, which i love. you never know who'll pop-up for a cameo or will be ret-conned into a central role. more great traps, the most difficult involving a fishhook, a key, and a stomach, the most satisfying placing four skinheads into an elaborate four-person car of death, make saw 7 a perfectly serviceable finale (yeah, right) to this engaging and quality series. loaded with unrepentant gore.

NO! It has more than that.
I have watched every Saw movie in the theater and the hangover left me speechless. Was it because I was shocked? no. I was pissed that the story doesn't lead to anywhere except saying ""Now you gotta wait for a sequel next year sucker"".
This complete collection relieved that stress.

The movie Saw shows true nature of human being.
We hurt and kill people for your own benefit.
I won't spoil for you but Jigsaw ""Kindly"" helps those people face their problem and make them new.

The movie is full of plot twists. Always make you wonder and guess.

This then took a bit of time for my Flixster collection to transfer to UV and then to VUDU. That being said, this was pretty much a non-issue as it only took a bit of tinkering online to fix.

6576387,4,B00MFCPURE,"Super fast shipping. Each movie looks great on my TV. Although the digital copy made me almost pull out my hair.

They ask you to go to a website, which I did. Then you put in the code, and are redirected to Flixter. Flixter must be down or something because I had to make an entirely new account just to put it onto my VUDU account. I tried my normal account but it said that something wasn't working, and I sent in a request to change my password 3 times. It still didn't work so I made a new account with a different email since it was giving me so much trouble. After it finally let me in I was relieved to finally put it into my Vudu account.

This was a very cheap price considering how many movies you're getting, on blu-ray as well. Individually its a nightmare, but now in one set for a low-ish price was a dream. Not to mention they are possibly making an 8th one. So grab a copy of this set and binge it just in case they do decide to make another.",1470873600,3,959,4.042105263157895

Just sign in, put in the code, and you get all access to the movies and special features. And the digital copy code worked for me as of 4/12/16 even though the paper says code may not be valid after 9/23/15. So if you got your set and didn't try the code just because the paper says it expired try the code anyway, it'll probably work! Bottom line, this Blu-ray set is a steal.

6576446,3,B00MFCPURE,"I have been down sizing my film collections as my ever shrinking  video shelf space is well over its limit. I have thousands of films on DVD/Blu Ray... even some on VHS. I won't compromise my most cherished films, but franchises such as Saw, Friday The 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, I  don't require all the bells and whistles, just a complete collections with quality sound and audio, some interesting bonus material is a plus.

I have been looking for compact collections to replace of the larger ones that fit this category I have in my collection. I already upgraded the others mentioned above, but was a little more hesitant with this box set because it holds 7 films on 3 discs. Yes, it is pushing the capacity a bit, but I can tell you first hand that the films look very good on this blu ray set. Would they have looked better if only 1 film per disc? More than likely, but the films do look much better than their DVD counter parts. Extras? NONE! This isn't a deal breaker for me as while I like the films I don't feel a need to own any bonus material. The set is super compact with a hinged spindle case.

The films, well if you're a fan there isn't much more to say, but I can tell you underneath all that grisly blood and gore lies a very well put together story, in fact, out of all of the horror franchises that come to mind I think the Saw series may be the most consistent when it comes to quality. I may like the original Halloween better, but there are sure a few clunkers in that series, ditto, Friday the 13, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the list goes on. I don't think any of the Saw films are bad films.

The Blu Ray quality looks very good here, I don't think they are as sharp as they could be at all times, but I didn't notice any artifacts or problems with playback. It's a tough call to judge as the lighting is over saturated in many scenes with odd lighting effects too. Most of the time the video is crisp and clear, but there are some minor instances that may appear slightly softer, It is hard to tell if this is from the lighting or the compressed video presentation. Regardless, I am very happy with the quality, the films included are all the unrated versions, which I'm glad they were consistent with, no one wants some unrated and some theatrical version in one collection. I would have given this set a little better rating if they would have made it four discs instead of three, maybe adding a few trinkets about the series. I found this for $10 around Halloween, so it's pretty hard to complain about at that price and most importantly I can sell off my deluxe DVD editions which had become too cumbersome for my shelf anymore.",1459123200,2,2706,4.350495049504951

I thought, 7 discs would be very thorough in how to use my new hand saw. But, to my surprise the hand saw was barely used! And these discs were movies! As opposed to what I was thinking they were, a how-to-use a saw guide. With my frustration, I went outside to hand saw some small trees, a bird house, and later lunch (a sandwich sawed in half). Besides my mistake, not a bad series if the people this serial killer was taking had worked together more of them could have lived.",1453680000,,593,4.120689655172414

The 7 films offer plenty of shocks, twist & turns, and suspense to keep the viewer engaged throughout the entire film series, along with bucket loads of gore, mostly in the later films.

The quality of the films does take a significant downturn after the first two films. The puzzle elements of jigsaw's games which I thought made the first two films great are nowhere to be found in the following five films, which annoyed me somewhat. But there is consistency in plot throughout the 7 films and enough entertaiment to keep you watching through the entire series of films.

6576529,3,B00MFCPURE,"I recently re-watched all of these movies, because i wanted to be sure on how i felt about them.
But first. This dvd set is strictly just the unrated versions of the films, which usually only adds about 3-7 minutes per film of footage. Some of it is worth it, others is just strictly for time crunches.
The dvds are okay, nothing special, all lumped together with about two movies per disc. Okay menu setup.
The films themselves aren't individually good, except for SAW 6, that one is pretty stand-alone, while it does connect with the other films, it's just independently a good movie. The rest of them fall rather flat, using a lot of the same gimmicks and directing, despite switching directors from time to time. I do however appreciate them all as one story, the piecing together of them all, must have taken such immense work, so that sometimes the stories themselves (aka the films) seem like filler, to get to the intricate twist that is SAW. In the big picture it's good, it's very good, however the getting from point A to point B is sometimes horribly boring. I will give the SFX crew all the credit, because some of those scenes are just, so artistically impressive.
All in all i would watch them again (probably skipping 1,2 and most of 7)",1446249600,,1252,4.568888888888889

6576572,4,B00MFCPURE,"Seven films.  Wow.

Saw is a great film.  Pretty good idea -- have a serial killer that doesn't actually kill, but puts his ""victims"" in a situation that they must scar themselves to live, whilst also teaching them the value of life.  It was pretty well written, and kept my interest all the way through.  The end had me cheering.  A great twist to the whole story.  After watching it in the theater, I told all my friends and they too agreed that it was a great flick.

Saw II:  Okay story.  I started to realize that the movies were beginning to focus more on the traps rather than the story.  This formula stuck throughout the other films.  Not a bad thing, but the story began to suffer because of it.  We learn a bit more about the Jigsaw character.  How he thinks, how he picks his victims, and why he does what he does.  The cast does an okay job.  Shawnee Smith reprises her role as Amanda Young.  Another twist, this time not as big of a surprise as the first one.

Saw III - 3D:  Each film going forward now work on the plot twist structure.  Who was a good guy last film is now a bad guy the next film, or was he.  The traps become more and more elaborate to the point that I think some of the characters aren't smart enough to build some of them.

Again, they focus way too much on the traps, which loses the feel of the first film.  The message got lost, and that message was, that Kramer didn't want people to waste their lives.  Now, they have just started with ideas of torture devices and wrote a thin script around them.

Don't get me wrong, they're not bad films.  But, they're not great either.  I've watched them all, and well, will watch them again.

Some great gore in these.  The traps are the selling point for these flicks, not the story.",1438992000,,1764,4.228915662650603

My research is indicating that ""Saw VI"" and ""The Final Chapter"" may not have been cleared for UV release even though they are listed on the code insert.

6576591,4,B00MFCPURE,"I've seen some complaints regarding this set, particularly when it comes to the fact that it doesn't contain any special features, and for its slightly compressed picture and audio quality.

I really wouldn't call that a fair criticism of this set, given the fact that this is very clearly a budget-release for cost-conscious buyers.  The fact is, for a great price, you're getting seven movies in a pretty darned-good quality (compressed or not, the films films still look good here, just perhaps not as perfect as in prior Blu-Ray releases) in a very convenient set.

This 3-Disc Blu-Ray set contains the unrated versions of all seven films in the ""Saw"" franchise, which were of course originally released between the years 2004-2010.  While I don't want to give too much of a review of the plotlines of the films to avoid spoiling it, here's a brief synopsis:  In an unnamed city, a figure known as ""The Jigsaw Killer"" has been placing his victims into twisted tests and games of torture and death...  But Jigsaw doesn't actually want people to die- he wants them to survive their tests, under a misguided ideal that by confronting and overcoming death, they will become better people who will better-appreciate the gift of life.  The seven films follow the various interlocking characters (victims, police, etc.) who are woven into Jigsaw's grand schemes.

For less than $20, this is a good choice for people who want to own just the films but don't want to spend $5-10 on each film separately, for people who haven't seen the series and are interested in checking it out, or for people who already own the films but want a cheap and convenient back-up.

This really is an ideal set for transportation, loaning out to friends or holding marathons of the series, as it's 3 discs (with 2-3 movies per disc) in one regular-sized (and easy-to-move/transport) case, as opposed to having to schlep around seven different cases, make sure all the films discs are clean, etc.  I own all the films already on DVD and Blu-Ray, but I still bought this because the ""Saw"" series has a lot of nostalgia for myself and my friends, so we often end up re-visiting it, and this set just makes it all the more convenient to bring over and leave at my friend's houses for when we do marathons or to loan it out to new friends who haven't seen them yet.

If you think this is a set you'd be interested in, chances are you will be satisfied.  If you're looking for the best quality and special features, skip this and go for the standard, stand-alone releases.  But if you're looking for just the movies on a budget, definitely give this set a shot.",1435968000,3,2631,4.681127982646421

6576597,3,B00MFCPURE,"Great horror series but I was expecting more from the set. I've been waiting for a boxed set since it finished and I have to say, I was probably better off buying them individually.

I personally like all the extras and bts in  Dvd's and this doesn't contain any the two disk movies had. All this is is three blu-rays with a handful of movies on each disk. I guess I was looking for a big box that held all the movies in each DVD as released originally, like they did with others movie series.

If you just want the movies in a single package, this is good. You want more than that, you aren't going to get that here.

4* for the series (It does get predictable towards the end of the run)

3* for packaging. (Just wanted more from this.)",1434672000,2,738,4.169014084507042

6576686,4,B00MFCPURE,"Sure, this collection doesn't include any extras and maybe the video quality won't be the best because of including 2-3 movies per disc. However...

1. Price: This has to be one of the best deals out there. You're paying a little more than the DVD collection for 7 movies. If, on the other hand it was asked for the customers to pay full price for a collection that doesn't include extras then that's another thing. There's barely a chance that you'd get a single movie on BD for this price much less 7.

2. Unrated: On top of everything the versions included are the Unrated ones. And tha makes it even better.

In the end it depends on each one. If you're a SAW fan you most probably would want to get the best versions available and those would be the individual releases.

Just throwing caution. No features. Just the movies w/subtitles.  PICTURES STILL 1080/60p

6576725,4,B00MFCPURE,"Because of how dark everything in this movie is, the higher quality is actually sometimes useful. If you're thinking of watching them all, purchasing the complete movie collection is worth it, it's about the same cost as renting all 7 of them would be anyway plus you own it. Worst thing is you don't like it and you pass it on. The only thing to complain about on this edition is the lack of extras, which isn't something I usually watch anyway, but something I think a lot of people expect on editions like these.

Now, on the movies, spoiler free reviews.

Saw- 4 stars, really liked it, brilliant premise, good execution, appropriate utilization of gore, this could solidly be played at a slumber party for scares but also something you could really think about.

Saw II- 3 stars, it was alright, I think it focused a lot on the crime solving bit which I don't like in my horror movies.

Saw III- 3.5 stars, initial scenes were incredibly gory, however once you understand where it's going and what's happening it's a pretty good movie

Saw IV- 2 stars, I did not like this movie, it sucked, it was incredibly confusing, the only reason I could say I am glad I watched this is because now I know that the people who made this series have no idea how to alert the audience to flashbacks. \We're getting to the point where they're really reaching for an excuse to make more movies.

Saw V- 3.5 stars, there is an open fracture in this movie which gives me the heebie jeebies more than anything else, maybe some slightly gratuitous gore but overall pretty good. I almost wanted this to be two movies, one being the crime solving flashback drama, and one being the actual horror movie. I think the main ""game"" in this one was one of my favorites.

Saw VI-  2 stars. The movie was gory and boring. The opening scenes had a lot of opportunity for actual horror, but no one bothered to make it scary. The main game was pretty interesting, there was finally some actual attempt to solve crimes, but then about 80% of the movie was unjustified gore.

Saw VII- 3 stars,I think this was the scariest Saw I have seen since the original, and they did their best to bring everything full circle. I was pretty meh about their plot twist ending though.",1420156800,,2240,4.484029484029484

Amazingly I was surprised that these films, although really gory, had a pretty good crime thriller aspect to them. We originally thought these films were nonsensical and meant for cheap gross out factors, but the story is really engaging. WARNING, yes the movies are incredibly gory and make you twinge sometimes, but the story helps to make it better. Over all I didn't want to have to pay for each movie individually and after doing some math decided to go with this collection (math came out to be that you'd get the 6th and 7th movie free). I think these movies have become a staple in the American horror genre, and this cheap collection helps complete your horror collection!",1419811200,2,782,4.5928571428571425

6576733,4,B00MFCPURE,"I just received this collection last night as an early Christmas present so haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I saw a lot of reviews where people were complaining about the fact that not all of the movies were the Unrated versions nor were there any extras.  When I plugged in my digital code into VUDU it gave me Unrated versions of all 7 movies and gave me Features for all 7 movies with the heading ""Bonus Content Now Available On Digital For the First Time"" listed at the top so maybe it's something that they've recently added to the collection.

Features listed are as follows:

Saw - ""Hacking Away At Saw"", ""Sawed Off"", and ""Full Discloser Report"", as well as Saw director James Wan's original short film.

Saw II - ""Jigsaw's Game"", ""The Head Trap"", ""The Needle Pit"", ""The Hand Trap"", ""The Furnace"", ""Bits and Pieces"", ""The Story Behind the Story"", ""A Memorial Tribute to Producer Greg Hoggman"", and ""The Scott Tibbs Documentary"".

Saw III - ""The Traps of Saw III"", ""The Props of Saw III"", ""The Writing of Saw III"", and ""Darren's Diary"".

Saw IV - ""The Traps of Saw IV"", ""The Props of Saw IV"", ""Darren's Video Diary"".

Saw V - ""The Pendulum Trap"", ""The Cube Trap"", ""The Coffin Trap"", ""The Fatal Five"", and ""Slicing the Cube"".

Saw VI - ""The Traps of Saw VI"", ""Jigsaw Revealed"", ""Making SAW: Game Over"".

Saw: The Final Chapter - ""52 Ways to Die"", and Deleted and Extended Scenes.",1419206400,42,1394,4.52191235059761

However, after reading all the reviews I took my chances and ordered the item. I have watched all four of the films so far and have NO complaints.
The picture quality is just as good as any other blu rays, the sound quality is just fine as I watched the films on my sound system.

6576805,4,B00MFCPURE,"...Meh. It's alright, really, it is exactly what was advertised. Includes all 7 unrated films. But there are no extras, no commentaries, no trivia, no frills whatsoever. I have grown to expect extras from BluRay box sets, little tidbits that cannot be gleaned from the film itself.

With single-layer BluRay disks holding 25GB of data, and doubles holding 50GB, this is very much possible. Many filmmakers try to fill that space with extras, to give people more bang for their buck & more incentive to buy films instead of stream or steal. But this has nothing but the 7 films on 3 disks.

It's a good watch, and for the barebones price, you really can't complain. Hence 4 stars, not lower. But just bear in mind, seven movies on 3 disks is all you're going to get. Oh, and mine came with a small chip in the case as well (corner). But boo-hoo. All the disks read & all the films looked nice.",1414713600,,892,4.466257668711656

All the films look fantastic and are the Unrated versions, which add important exposition to the films and fleshes out the characters and their motivations better (as well as adding a tiny bit or gore that was cut to get an R-Rating in theaters). I always thought this was one of the better horror franchises of the new Millennium and very well plotted (Part IV being the weakest) until the awful found footage PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise took over its Halloween theatrical spot (but it is showing its age and the latest chapter has been moved to March 2015, leaving no horror films theatrically for Halloween 2014, so some theaters are showing the original SAW!). If you like the SAW franchise, but are only in it for the films and not the extras (like I am), than you couldn't do better with this set.",1414540800,2,1107,4.485148514851486

6576810,2,B00MFCPURE,"Lionsgate while successful, but is more in the 2nd row of major studios as even their more popular films normally can't compete with the bigger studios except the Saw franchise and oddly enough they've never had great home video releases (in terms of extras). There are pros and cons to this set, which hopefully will help you decide if the set is worth it. The biggest problem we film collectors often have is shelf room right? Well the case is a standard Blu-ray case so it won't eat up a ton of room. That for me is a big deal and while I love having individual cases like the Halloween Collection, but it takes up a lot of shelf space. So that's the one thing I love about this set. However what I like pretty much ends there.

There are NO features on this set, which isn't a huge deal for me. It's frustrating that the features were dropped, but it isn't a deal breaker for me. As I write this review the price is 17$ so you really can't complain about the lack of features at that price for 7 movies. There are 7 films spread out over 3-discs, but fear not the Blu-ray format can hold a ton of information so quality will be perfectly fine. The reason I rated this set 2-stars is the audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital whereas as past Blu-ray releases were either 6.1 or even 7.1. Why, why, why would Lionsgate downgrade the audio to DVD standards???? If the 5.1 Dolby digital were the only audio option on past releases I wouldn't be angry over it. Most reviews focus on the lack of features and not the downgrade in audio. Had I known that I may have passed

If you have all the Blu-rays there's absolutely no reason to purchase this. Unlike the Halloween Collection (besides the Producers Cut) at least we got some new features and sure it was overpriced, but I could understand why someone with the Blu-rays would still purchase the set. I'm one of them. But this set all features dropped, downgrade in audio what's the point of it?

If you only have the DVDs or maybe you don't own any of the releases the only reason to,buy the set is if you're out of shelf room or you wanna save money. Buying all the Blu-rays in single editions would probably run you about 35-40 dollars so with the money saved you can buy quite a number of things here on amazon. However if you don't care about the money or shelf room buy the single releases since you get better audio and if features matter you get that as well.

Whoever was in charge of this set should be fired. I simply, do not understand the downgrade in audio. With that and lack of features (which again isn't a big deal for me since the features weren't all that) but what's the point of the collection if we get an inferior release? So again if shelf room is the main thing than the set is the better option. If its a money situation the set again, but if you want the absolute best editions and spending the extra cash isn't a big deal just buy the solo releases. The most odd thing is Lionsgate gave the Leprechaun Collection a far superior release over what are their biggest hit films.

My guess at some point Lionsgate will give the Saw collection another release that's far better than this. They got enough of my money and I won't buy it even if a 5-star set. Regardless, I gave the pros and cons of this set and it's up,to you what matters most. Again I like the fact it takes up little room, but to be honest I have 5-7 on Blu-ray and when I revisit those I'll be watching my single release editions rather than the set simply for,the audio.",1414454400,7,3504,4.303030303030303

There are three discs: D1- Saw 1 & 2; D2- Saw 3, 4, & 5; D3- Saw 6 & 7. If it's worth an extra $100 (total) for you to get special features, then buy them separately.

At less than $20, one can't really complain about the overall quality.

6576838,5,B00MFCPURE,"Basically this is the unrated cuts of all 7 Saw movies on Blu-ray spread over three disks (Saw I-II on Disk 1, Saw III, IV, and V, on Disk 2, and Saw VI and VII on Disk 3). Sadly, there's no extras on any of the disk except the movies themselves, not even scene selection menus (though, you can still skip scenes like usual). There are still subtitle options, thankfully, but only in English and Spanish.

However, where this set lacks in extras, it makes up for in video quality! It's hard to believe that the video quality for each movie would remain intact despite sharing disk space with each other, but it thankfully still holds up just fine. And yes, each movie is in 1080p so enjoy seeing each gory trap scene in glorious full HD quality!

Overall, it may not be the extras-filled release most fans might be wanting, but to just own all 7 movies both unrated AND in good video quality all in one pack, it's absolutely worth it. Plus, the price of it here on Amazon (at least at the time I bought this new), was pretty cheap AND it also comes with an Ultraviolet code to get all 7 movies digitally in a bundle to watch via Vudu on your mobile device, so consider that a bonus!",1413331200,4,1182,4.2959641255605385

If your getting this for the uv copies save your money.  I know this isn't amazon's fault the blame solely lies with lionsgate and anyone else involved with them.,1413072000,7,498,4.358695652173913
6576841,3,B00MFCPURE,"I have never been a huge fan of the ""Saw"" series of films.  Not that they are a particularly bad series.  But neither are they a particularly great series either.  I personally felt that Hostel & Hostel II were a notch better (Hostel III was the worst but as Meatloaf once sang, 2 out of 3 ain't bad) as far as ""SMBD"" Horror movies went.
  But I digress.  When I observed that the Saw series of films were comming out in a set, I went hmmmmm, let me ponder on wheather I should purhase this series or not.  Fortunately, a nice confluence of events occourd to prompt me to buy this particular series.  A) I had a $5 off certificate from Best Buy.  B) Best Buy had the series on Sale for $19.99.  C) They priced comparisoned me to Target/Amazon down to $17.89.  My Price after the Price comparison down to $17.89 & a Best Buy $5 off coupon = $14.05 with tax as opposed to $21.79 with tax without Price comparison and $5 coupon.  That works out to a smidge over $2 a film.
  That is the first good part.  The Second Good part is I got all 7 films in one set.  The third good part: The picture quality is actually very good for all of the movies.  & lastly, All of them are on UV so I can watch them on any of my digital accounts.
  The bad part(s):  1) I am not a huge fan of the series.  2) 3 discs containing all 7 of the Saw Films.  & 3) Regardless of any fandom, this is a no frills bare bones set.  I mean, these days, most films on Blu-Ray (& DVD), even ones that weren't very popular, have some sort deleted scenes or commentary tract.  These don't even have a ""Chapter menu""!  Even the ""Escape From L. A."" Blu-Ray I have has a ""Chapter Menu""!  & that is about as bare bones as a Blu-Ray comes these days!  I would have expected as popular as this film series as this is....I would expect at LEAST some sort of commentary tract on a two or three of these!!!
  The bottom line on this 3 Blu-Ray disc, 7 Film set is this:  For the price $21.79 including tax (or $3.11 per film), this is a good edition to get if one just wants to get the series.  The price is right, the series is at least a little more than nominally entertaining, & lets face it, For anyone who has a movie collection (& digital account(s)), these are worth having around.
*****************************UpDate As Of 10/19/14*******************************
  While I don't think I will up this to 4 stars, I will state that I do happen to like this set a bit more than I previously stated.  Mostly because since I do a Horror Movie Marathon for October, I wound up watching all 7 of these movies almost back to back.  The picure quality is very good.  I find that it loses nothing between using my digital accounts, using the Blu-Rays, or using my Amazon Kindle to watch any of these films.  Having them on both Blu-Ray AND Ultra-Violet Digital account(s) is a definate bonus!  Having a compact case is worth the space savas a collectiing.  And while I am really not a particular fan of these films, I do enjoy having them as a set in my Blu-Ray/film collection.
  My ONLY real complaint on this edition, and I do mean my only complaint, is that there was no commentary tract and/or Bonus features.
  With that being said, this is great to have in my Collection",1413072000,2,3230,4.260726072607261

6576857,4,B00MFCPURE,"The Saw Franchise is simple - viewers leave your logic at the door and you will enjoy these movies.

The premise for this franchise is that there is a person, named Jigsaw, who pits people in a puzzle (game) that they have to figure out how to free themselves, while they are inflicting some sort of injury either onto themselves or onto others.

Logically, no man or team, would be able to construct these traps, games, puzzles, within the time frame that they are set up. Nor would anyone be able to know that much information about everyone involved. Additionally, police stations are often deserted or with only a few employees working at a time.

Now, if you leave this logic behind, and just watch the movies, you will be entertained by the notion of a ""game"" where the ""players"" have to make life-saving or life-ending decisions. The games are very intricate and the players all have some reason why they are in the game. I recently bought this 7-movie set and watched all 7 over a weekend. It is amazing how different directors are able to piece together pieces of all the movies together, like a Jigsaw puzzle. Get it?

There are many scenes that are not for the faint of heart but if you are watching these movies then I assume you are a horror fan. I do not want to give anything away, but all 7 movies are inter-connected somehow and each movie has its own plot twists that are clever and leave you going...oh now I see it! Towards the end of the franchise (which I am not sure if it actually over), the movies tend to get a little more ridiculous in terms of the games, players, and plots. They are still enjoyable to watch, but by the 5,6,7 movie, you may be like, that is impossible or what was the point of that?

I gave this movie 7 a 4 star rating because there were NO extras! The movies all seemed fine to me in terms of the ratings. I believe people are complaining that they are ""Rated R"" not Unrated, but they are gory movies that seemed to have enough gore for anyone. The box itself says all the movies are Unrated and there seemed to be scenes that I don't remember seeing the first time around that I watched the movies individually.

Now, if you read this review and it influenced your decision, then make your choice...",1412553600,7,2248,4.404819277108434

6576860,4,B00MFCPURE,"The value of this collection made it a reasonable purchase, though the quality of the overall set leaves something to be desired. It does have the feel of a quick cash-in, trying to squeeze the franchise onto as few discs as possible; in addition to lacking some of the ""love"" from the studio that's evident in other sets. It's hard to deny the impact the franchise had on the genre, though most of the films have ridden the success of the first few films.

- No HD Audio, all movies are in Dolby Digital 5.1. The standalone Blu-rays have various soundtracks, 1 has 6.1 DTS, 2 3 have 6.1 DTS HighRes, and 4 5 6 have 7.1 DTS-HD MasterAudio and ""final chapter"" has 5.1 DTS-HD MasterAudio, and those soundtracks get good reviews!

6576890,4,B00MFCPURE,"I love the Saw series. What i didn't like was trying to redeem the UV digital version. I primarily use VUDU. I logged in and tried to redeem the code. It doesn't have that movie in their library. It has all the individual movies but not the complete collection. I then tried Flixster (which I have an account but do not really use). It allowed me to use the code but only Saw 1-5 shows on my Flixster account. I logged out and back in and still not showing the last 2. Also they were not all unrated versions. Ok well I went to UV site uvvu.com. I looked for my movies in that library. None of the Saw movies shows. Logged out and in and no Saw movies. I then log in to my VUDU account and all 7 Saw movies now show there. Not all of them unrated versions. I downloaded the movies and on 1-5 gave me the HDX versions to download. The last 2 were the normal versions. This is the most trouble I have ever had in redeeming UV codes. It sucks also because they do not have phone numbers you can call. You just have to email them and wait for them to get back to you which takes about 2 days. Anyway, I emailed UV, VUDU and Flixster and will wait to see what they say because all movie collection should be available on all sites since it gives you those to pick from on redeemmovie.com. Also all 7 movies should be in that collection, all 7 movies should be unrated and all 7 movies should be the HD HDX version.",1411430400,3,1409,4.071942446043166
6576891,1,B00MFCPURE,"Be warned. The Digital HD is for Ultraviolet. It was not stated that it was Ultraviolet in the description when I ordered it. I didn't find out until I opened it and now cannot return it. AMAZON, please include what version of digital downloads are included in the future.",1411430400,2,272,4.571428571428571
6576892,3,B00MFCPURE,"Unrated versions with no extras it seems. I had to redeem the ultraviolet code through flixster as vudu doesn't have a listing for the Saw Collection on their UV redemption page. That didn't really matter though since UV movies are pushed to all linked accounts. I checked and they are now in my vudu library as well.

I just noticed that the UV redemptions are not for the unrated versions for all of the movies. It seems Saw and Saw 2 only have one version. The UV code gave me unrated versions for Saw 3, 4, and 5 but Saw 6 and 7 are only theatrical cuts. I searched vudu on my xbox and it lists unrated versions available for 6 and 7 but when I search their UV code redemption site, I can only find the theatrical versions. Kind of annoying for an unrated collection to come with theatrical cuts for the UV versions.

  Perhaps wait until Vudu adds the Saw Collection to their UV redemption page and you will get all unrated versions. Going through flixster may have been a bad call.

Update: Flixster, Vudu and UV say its not their problem and to contact Lionsgate. Lionsgate told me that the UV copies are not for the unrated versions. That's obviously a lie since I did get some unrated UV copies and other people received even more.",1411430400,4,1240,4.397379912663755

There are only 60 minutes in an hour.  Duh.  That would be an average of about 90 minutes each.  That's 1 1/2 hours.  Hopefully this helps.  BTW, people saying this set is not worth $25 are not true SAW fans.  7 movies for $25 equals about $3.50 per movie... On Blu-ray.

6576894,4,B00MFCPURE,"Ok, I just got my pre-ordered copy and I can answer a couple questions many of us had.

1) It is Ultraviolet Digital HD which is great.  The only issue I saw was that this particular collection is only available on Flixster right now as far as I can tell.  The individual Saw movies are available on VUDU but they are not all the unrated versions as in this collection.  It really didn't matter to me as I use Flixster as well as VUDU.

2) Although I have not watched the movies as of yet it appears that it is just the movies. NO bonus material.  No where on the package or discs is there anything about Bonus Material.  I don't care much about this as I have most of the individual movies with the bonus material and I hardly watch the bonus stuff anyhow.

All in all I am very happy with this purchase.  I got my Blu-Ray copy of the collection for $22 as I pre-ordered early.  I only had the DVD versions of 1-5 and did not own 6 and The Final Chapter at all.  So for $22 I now have all 7 Saw movies on Blu-Ray and Digital HD, that is quite a movie deal.

SAW II

DISC 2 -
SAW III
SAW IV
SAW V

DISC3 -
SAW VI
SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER

My first (minor) gripe is that it would've been nice to have had the original 3 films on one disc (since they do really tell one story from start to finish). Besides that this is a fantastic collection if you're a fan of the series. Are they super, great horror films? Of course not. These are highly flawed and not too wonderfully acted movies. But unlike so many of the late 70s, 80s and 90's horror/slasher movies that kept pumping out so many (stupid and empty) sequels, the SAW films don't feel like absolute cash grabs. They all wonderfully connect to tell one continuous story (even though starting at part 4 everything becomes superfluous). I didg'em. What  can I say? Call it torture porn or whatever you want. Now, for hardcore collector's who are into different sound formats and making-of extras, this is my 2nd gripe, you're out of luck. In order for all these films to fit onto 3 BD discs (in high definition no less) all you get is a 5.1 sound option and some English subtitles. Truth is, only SOME of the film commentaries were worth a listen and none of the behind the scenes features in the previously released DVD and Blu ray releases were worth anyone's time. So, you're really not losing out on anything. I'm all for a plethora of audio commentaries and making-of documentaries and featurettes, but $25 for all the SAW movies? It's a no-brainer. It's a GREAT deal. For those on the fence just keep your eye on this set. Lionsgate is one of the cheapest studio to buy Blu rays from. A few months after their initial release a majority of their titles decrease in price. When this set first went live with its pre-orders it was a shade under $18. I would suspect it'll lower to that price again (or go even lower) once the holiday season is in full effect. Picture quality on the films is very hit or miss. Not so much because of the Blu ray transfer but because the films were low budget, shot very quickly and obviously weren't filmed w/ the best cameras. There's a lot of grain in these films (so I doubt they'll ever look THAT good until we get the inevitable re-mastered anniversary box set) and the prior home video releases never really got the best scores when it came to the video source (those praises were usually saved for the audio part which is totally not represented in this release).

Keeping in mind that most 90 to 120 minute movies come in at between 1.5 and 2 Gigabytes (GBs) each; the industry standard, dual layer BD disc holds 50 GBs or enough space for 25 2-hour movies, so there's still enough room for plenty of bonus features and commentaries!

8671937,3,B00MFCPURE,"Very happy with the movies grew up watching the saw series movie quality does not disappoint. I however couldn't be more disappointed in the overall presentation of the ""collection"". Normally when I think collection I think more of the special edition or collector's edition now I collect 100s of movies 4k HDR and blu ray and iv never gotten a collection that's a single case with no cover sleeve, no box, no memorabilia inside of the case and the movies arnt even individually packaged there are 3 disks with the movies spread between them other than those few issues it's a great value for the money and I'd suggest any horror fan pick up the entire collection for the price",1531785600,,677,4.65
