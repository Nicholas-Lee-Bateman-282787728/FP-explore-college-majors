8482467,1,B005PF9JQQ,I have a problem with the product purchased.  It does not work and as a Christmaas gift for my Grandson is very disappointing.  I am now looking into returning it & trying to get a DVD that is readable and not from a distributor that does not provide a non workable product.,1419552000,,274,4.25
8482468,3,B005PF9JQQ,This is an excellent movie and it seems quite accurate but a little too much reality for me.,1404691200,,92,4.166666666666667
8482469,5,B005PF9JQQ,"I really enjoyed it.  It focused on dinosaurs you were less familiar with than the norm.  Different members of the Trex family which I found to be very interesting and excited to see (I love Trex species).  If you like watching dinosaurs movies or documentaries, this is a really good to add to the collection.",1398384000,,310,4.6
8482470,5,B005PF9JQQ,"This is an excellent film about adventures and fate of various dinosaurs living in the Cretaceous period on the northern edge of what would in the future become North America. 70 millions years ago the world was much warmer than it is now and forests extended very far beyond the Arctic Circle, into what is today the cold and desolate extremity of Canadian Far North. Large numbers of dinosaurs lived in those forests which offered food in abundance, from spring to autumn. Winters however were ferocious and many dinosaurs migrated south at the end of autumn - when others, less adapted to long distance marches, toughed it out through the cold season.

The story follows mainly two characters. Scar is a very young Edmontosaurus (a large herbivorous ""duck billed"" dinosaur) who must survive his first long march south. Patch is a young, although already more mature Troodon (a small, wolf sized, carnivorous dinosaur), who must not only make it through the winter, but also learn to attract a mate. There are however many other dinosaurs appearing in that story. There is a whole herd of Pachyrhinosaurs, large and brutish horned dinosaurs walking together with the hundreds of Edmontosaurus. On their way, the herbivorous migrants will have to face a pack of fierce Albertosaurus, following them and setting ambushes. There will be also danger in the rivers the two herds must cross and the giant scavenging Queltzalcoatlus will circle in the sky, awaiting patiently the death of stragglers...

Amongst those who choose to stay in the forests and face the winter, there is a solitary Gorgosaurus (a smaller cousin of T-Rex), the unquestioned alpha predator of the Far North, but also a resourceful and tough Edmontonia, an armoured dinosaur. The Edmontonia parts are slightly marred by an error, as the narrator calls this animal an ""Ankylosaur"". Edmontonia was indeed related to THE Ankylosaur but they were different animals (and Ankylosaur, at 9 m, was much more formidable that 6 m long Edmontonia).

The story is very interesting and there are many surprises in it, which I will not reveal here. The topic of the Troodons is a particularly interesting one, as those dinosaurs had brains larger (in proportion to the bodies) than any other dinosaur and they also possessed relatively long forepaws with quite agile fingers. Some scientists claim in fact (although it is a controversial claim) that given enough time Troodons or some of their cousins could have evolved into intelligent forms...

I absolutely loved this movie and I am certain anybody who is interested in dinosaurs will spend a nice moment watching it. Please be WARNED however, that younger children can find it scary due to the killing scenes, especially those in which some cute little mammals are swallowed whole or ripped in pieces by the Troodons.",1380499200,2,2828,5.036324786324786
8482471,5,B005PF9JQQ,"Awesome dinosaur movie, I  would highly recommend it. A nice change of pace from the usual dinosaur documentary a must buy for dino lovers.",1355529600,,139,4.791666666666667
8482472,4,B005PF9JQQ,"This film, from the makers of the even more stunning series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", is a pure cinematic documentary delight. For a film on a television budget, it is a first class production that shows in every frame. The story is very simple as mentioned in the synopsis on this page: a herd of Edmontosaurs must migrate in the harsh arctic land. In a way, it is the same kind of story featured in films like The Land Before Time and Disney's Dinosaur. However, unlike both of those films, this really is a documentary, with no ""talking dinosaurs"", only narration by the wonderful Stephen Fry. While it features some educated guesses in areas in terms of accuracy (like most documentaries of this type do), it is the visual spectacle and drama that should be the main focus here. You really get involved with the cast of dinosaurs as they each go through different struggles in this harsh and unlikely landscape. The cinematography here is not typical for a film like this, with the camera always moving and gliding through the scenery and following the dinosaurs. This production is entirely CGI, which makes this kind of camera work possible for the story. While the animation is generally very well-done, I admit that it often never feels entirely ""real"". It looks and feels more like a stylized experience of the past, which can be seen as a good and a bad thing all at the same time. There are some great segments of tension and action thrown in for good measure that will keep viewers young and old at the edge of their seat. The music was also good and served the film well. Honestly, if you are in the mood for an informative, different, engaging, and excitingly cinematic dinosaur film, this is one that you will definitely not want to miss.

As for this particular Blu-Ray (imported from the UK), the image and sound come across quite well. I can confirm here that Amazon's statement of this film being a Region Free (ABC) disc are correct. I have a Region A player and the film played flawlessly. However, it must be noted that other aspects of this disc will NOT work flawlessly for everyone. The bonus features (Storyboards/Making of) may NOT work on a Region A player or US television due to the way the bonus features are encoded (in PAL I believe, since they are standard definition unlike the main feature film). However, try playing these bonus features on your computer/laptop's Blu-Ray drive (if you have one) and they may work (as they do on mine). Just a tip. However, even if your TV can't play those bonus features mentioned, it CAN still access the commentary track in the audio menu, so it's not a complete loss. The commentary track was fairly well-done, although I wished it had been a bit more informative.

Whatever you do, do NOT purchase the DVD of ""The Great Dinosaur Escape"", which is what this movie is sometimes retitled. National Geographic took this film and re-cut it and used a different narrator for it's shorter edit. Skip it. This Blu-Ray here is the real edition of this film, and I'm sure looks much better and has better narration and pacing.

So, dinosaur fans, no need to guess if this disc belongs in your collection (or if it will play on your player or not). This film is a realistic version of The Land Before Time and what Disney's Dinosaur was supposed to be. Seek this one out!",1335484800,7,3335,4.6300675675675675
