2738553,5,B000MQ58WM,"There's nothing like watching the series that I grew up with and feeling like I'm taking a trip back in time.  It is my all time favorite series and I watch them over and over again. Each episode is an hour spent reflecting on days gone by, good and bad, but an hour of joy!",1177718400,8,274,3.981818181818182
2738554,5,B000MQ58WM,"With the exception of a few guest spots, this was Richard Thomas' final season as John-Boy. Stand out episodes include:

The Vigil - Mary Ellen makes a wrong diagnosis that puts Grandma near death.

The Baptism - Olivia struggles to get John and her kids baptized during a revival.

The Firestorm - John-Boy causes panic when he publishes parts of Hitler's Mein Kampf in his newspaper.

The Wedding - Mary Ellen goes through personal changes leading up to her wedding.

The Cloudburst - John-Boy crosses a line with Grandpa when he sells his meadow to a developer.

The Pony Cart - the best episode of the season IMO. Aunt Martha Corrine comes to visit the family and upsets everyone. But she's hiding a secret.

The Best Christmas - Olivia desperately wants the family to be together because she feels that this will be the last Christmas that the whole family will be together.

The Inferno - John-Boy travels to NJ and witnesses the Hindenburg disaster.

The Long Night - While visiting Esther in the hospital, Grandpa causes a disturbance and is banned from the hospital. Heartbreaking episode.

The Achievement - Grab your hankies. John-Boy travels to New York to check on the status of his novel and discovers it's time to leave home.",1170979200,86,1240,4.779342723004695

Once john Boy leaves the show, the scripts start sliding, sinking into that back hole of demise by using a good family show to make the producer's political comment.  Always a sure sign the show is tanking.  But Season 5, John Boy's last, still holds the charm----the final charm of a GREAT series through season 5.",1456358400,,440,4.615384615384615

2738636,5,B000MQ58WM,"I love the Waltons anyway, but I purchased this season before Season 3 which would have been the order for me but I saw a great price on it and I wanted the Christmas episode.  The episode is titled  ""The Best Christmas""  I had a copy of this episode on dvd until recently.  I always wished for the uncut and professionally released dvd.  I love this episode because it shows the true meaning of Christmas.  The whole family, especially Mom/ Olivia is hopeful that this will be last Christmas and yet everything is going wrong.  Happily as in most episodes, the problems begin to get solved and just in time for Christmas morning.  It is a very family friendly show anyway, but the Christmas one is an episode to remember.  The 2 other Christmas episodes with the Walton's are much less memorable.  The entire Walton's season 5 are some of the best and most memorable episodes to behold. Purchase season 5 for some very good entertainment from when television was actually entertaining and full of actors who knew how to act and writers who made them look good.",1389312000,,1061,4.595744680851064

I'd watched The Waltons seasons 1 and 2 a while back and enjoyed them thoroughly.  I'm gonna catch up eventually to all the other seasons she has now.  I might help her get the remaining seasons.

As for the Waltons itself, the 5th season has 24 episodes, I believe.  Seasons 1 and 2 have 24 each, so it's probably that way to the end (9th, out now).  Seasons 1 and 2 are CC so it's a plus for those needing visual aid to understand the spoken dialogues.  I believe the 5th is CC, also.

What can I say? The stories are quite engaging, but sweet; there is some tragedy but usually a happy ending; and it's intriguing to see the characters we've come to know start to grow up, get married and leave home.

All we are told in the 1st few episodes is that she's still in the hospital but never are we told why.

2738691,5,B000MQ58WM,"Season 5 has the Waltons entering the world...and the world coming to the mountain, as the Depression ends and World War II begins to draw near.

Eldest daughter Mary Ellen completes her nursing courses and marries, in a two-hour special where the family learns the only thing to expect of Mary Ellen is the unexpected.

Meanwhile, eldest son John-Boy drops out of college to publish his own newspaper. While the Blue Ridge Chronicle is a lifelong dream, John-Boy learns that he may be in over his head, in episodes such as ""The Firestorm,"" when the locals are angered over his decision to publish excerpts of Hitler's book, and ""The Cloudburst,"" when the threat of having the bank take his printing press causes John-Boy to sell the meadow Grandpa left him.

In a desperate attempt to raise money for school, second-eldest son Jason takes a job as pianist at the Dew Drop Inn -- a huge source of contention for Olivia and Grandma, who view the place as a den of sin.

Also, Erin begins a more adult life, working as a telephone operator; while Ben helps his brother with newspaper advertising, Jim Bob insists on being called James Robert as he tinkers with the old car parts he dreams of turning into a whole vehicle; and Elizabeth continues to enjoy her position as family baby.

Grandma faces serious illness, causing Grandpa much emotional trauma; and Richard Thomas departs at the end of the season, resulting in a different John-Boy until series end. In my opinion, it's always strange when they do that, even when I know they really had no choice, as Richard Thomas wanted to leave the show. It's just really difficult on viewers, watching a show for five seasons and getting used to one of the main characters, only to have him replaced.

This show is consistently excellent, with humor, poignancy and well-written storylines in every episode.",1193270400,,1852,4.789968652037618

2738698,4,B000MQ58WM,"As a child, one of the  highlights of my week was to watch the Waltons.  My mother is German, and as a result, we spent many years (off and on) overseas, and I missed most years of the show. In later years the show was shown in Germany, and became one of my grandmother's favorite shows (who happens to be a very proper Prussian Lady).

It has been my great pleasure to be able to watch the show in its entirety now.  The first four seasons I watched almost back-to-back, and it took me only a few weeks.  This fifth season is also very enjoyable, but I find some of the innocence and uniqueness of the program changing.  For one thing, now we have a teaser before the show starts, which I am sure is a result of the changing times on television itself.  Somehow it detracts from the show, because you have already glimpsed some key scenes.  The loss of innocence is probably in large part due to the children growing up.  Somehow the pace of the show is faster, and more facets to the plot are tried to be squeezed in.

All that being said, this show is worth every penny, and for me is still a solid four stars.  I look forward to watching the remaining episodes.",1186099200,2,1165,4.25
2738699,5,B000MQ58WM,"I've bought all 5 seasons, and am anticipating owning Season 6. Watching Season 5 brought back memories for me. I can actually remember watching the episodes when they came on t.v. on Thursday nights. My mom knew the biggest way to punish me was to threaten to not let me watch The Walton's.

Now, I'm a parent. And, like John & Olivia Walton, my wife and I have 7 children. (5 sons, 2 daughters) Now, a second generation are being entertained by watching The Walton's. I can draw many parallels between their family and ours, but I've never said anything about it to my own children. It didn't take long before the older ones were saying ""You know, Dad, we're not much different from The Walton's."" If only.....

Theirs is a story of a family struggling to make it through the Great Depression. It's filled with Hollywood-authored stories of trials, tribulation, triumph, and togetherness. At first, I'd think ""horse puckey"" when thinking that such a large family could get along so well. But I live with a large family, and know that the togetherness depicted on screen IS possible. It is my hope that my children will, one day, share the love of The Walton's with my grandchildren, and enable a third generation to experience true quality viewing entertainment. I don't think one could ever watch ""too much"" Walton's.

I just wished that Grandma had been able to be in the last few episodes. She made a brief appearance in the very last episode - and even at that, it was archive footage of John-Boy reminiscing back to when she was sharing stories with him. Her absence was palpable. What I would give to have heard her famous lines ""Good Lord!"" or ""You old fool.""

As with real life, the Walton family experiences a host of changes in their own lives. It's been said that the only certain thing in life is change, and that's so very true. We've watched the Walton children grow from inquisitive young children into budding young adults, and in Season 6, will experience the loss of a loved one to death. That's what I liked about the Waltons. They were real. So real, in fact, that I remember telling my folks ""When we go on our next vacation, can we go see the Walton's?""

Oh, to be young and innocent again.

In this season, here are some highlights that are my personal favorites:

The First Edition: John-Boy starts the ""Blue Ridge Chronicle"", and has to write about his brother, Ben, being involved in a break-in. It showed me the integrity that John-Boy possessed as a journalist, and how he wasn't biased.

The Cloudburst: Did anyone else feel a sense of betrayal when John-Boy sold ""John-Boy's Meadow"" to that developer? Man, I was so mad I could've bit a nail in half!

The Pony Cart: Aunt Martha Corrine (Beulah Bondi) was my all-time favorite guest star in the show's run. She was the embodiment of a mountain woman, and played her role very well.

The Hero: Was anyone else shocked to learn that Ep Bridges was a war hero? Who saw that coming?

The Inferno: Aside from the poor special effects, this was among my top 5 favorite episodes. John-Boy let us see his raw emotion as he relived the experience of being there when the Hindenburg blew up. I got a lump in my throat watching this episode.

The Long Night: Okay, if I got a lump during that last episode, I boo-hooed during this one. The love that Grandpa had for Grandma was so evident. For him to go sit outside of the hospital just so he'd be nearby, man, what an expression of true love. I actually did shed a tear, as it only reminded me just how much I love and treasure my own precious wife.

The Go-Getter: This episode is a reminder of how important it is to always remain honest in all things. When you're dishonest in an attempt to get ahead, someone's going to get hurt. Ben learned this lesson the hard way. He walked all over his brothers in an attempt to get ahead (and be closer to his beloved Darlene), but learned the hard way when he sold Mrs. Brimmer a lemon of a car. However, Jim-Bob stepped in and saved the day, showing his brother through actions that he forgave him. Also in this episode, Ep Bridges marries his long-lost sweetheart. This one is a don't miss!

The Achievement: This episode is every father's nightmare - when your firstborn decides to spread their wings and fly. It's a reminder of the Bible verse that reads ""Life is just a vapor. It appeareth for a short time, then vanishes away."" While it may not have been the physical end of John Walton's life, it ushered him into the next level of fatherhood - one that none of us fathers are too anxious to enter.

I hope you enjoy the Waltons as much as my family and I do. We don't have network television, so I'm really grateful that Warner Home Video has offered this timeless classic for home viewing. If you're considering purchasing the series for your own entertainment, it's a decision you won't regret. If you have children, you owe it to them to get The Walton's. It's pure family-values entertainment with a few sparse cheesy bits thrown in here and there.",1184371200,9,5026,4.532008830022075

So, please check your DVDs (disk 2 & 3 especially) to make sure that they are running properly while you are still able to send them back for exchange, as I did.

Although the character Mary Ellen was DEFINITELY my least favorite on the show, even she shines with her wedding double episode.  I really have enjoyed the episodes dealing with Sheriff Ep Bridges also.  The episode ""The Hero"" brought more tears to my eyes than most.

The only fault I can find in this collection is that the first set of discs I received had glitches on disc 1 side 2, making it unplayable.  I returned the entire set, and the replacement had glitches on that side also, but to a much less degree.  I think I will live with it.

Although the show suffered mightily with the loss of Richard Thomas, Will Geer, Ellen Corby, Michael Learned, and Ralph Waite in later seasons, I expect to buy the entire run of the shows.

We have ""The Fire Storm,"" in which John-Boy publishes excerpts from ""Mein Kampf"" and endures the wrath of some overzealous neighbors. ""The Vigil"" is outstanding as Mary Ellen makes a wrong diagnosis and Grandma almost dies. There are other great episodes which include Mary Ellen's wedding to Curt in a two-parter, and John-Boy covering the Hindenburg. And finally, this great fifth season culminates in Richard Thomas' last regular appearance in ""The Achievement"", in which he realizes his goal of having his novel published and he moves to New York. It is an excellent episode. Thankfully, Richard does make three guest appearances, his final shows of the series, near the end of season six. Buy Season Five of ""The Waltons."" It was still in its prime. In fact, it still plays pretty darn good yet today!",1178841600,2,894,4.966666666666667

8170773,4,B000MQ58WM,"I give this season 4 stars.  This is the last season with the complete original cast.  Richard Thomas (the definitive John-Boy) and Ellen Corby (Grandma) are the first to leave (Corby because of a real -life stroke) and Richard Thomas' last full season.  This season has some powerful episodes like ""The Vigil"" where Mary Ellen misdiagnoses Appendicitis for Intestinal flu on Grandma.  Powerful ending on that one...a real tear jerker.  Then we have the classic ""Book Burning"" episode as WWII and Hitler loom on the horizon.  Powerful acting by Thomas in this episode.  We also have mediocre episodes like ""The Wedding"".  The writers missed the mark on this one.  The character of Curt is introduced and Mary Ellen breaks her engagement to a good looking fine Dr. David Spencer (who in previous episodes wanted to become a mountain Dr.  All of a sudden this changes because ""fickle"" Mary Ellen ""falls in love"" with Curt who will supposedly be killed at ""Pearl Harbor"" in season 7 and resurrected on Season 9 By another actor.  This episode just didn't hold true for me.  Mary Ellen was particularly annoying in this episode.  Then we have a ridiculous episode ""The Great Motorcycle Race"" where Jim-Bob enters a motorcycle race despite protests from Olivia.  A creepy episode entitled ""The Ferris Wheel"" is Ellen Colby's last episode before her stroke.  She must have had the stroke in this episode because she only appears at the beginning with one line ""That's the second time this week.  Something's working on that child.""  You can tell the writers have to rewrite the scenes she was in because she disappears abruptly and ther's only one reference to her....Elizabet, who is sleep walking gets out of the house and the family is awakened.  Zeb comes out of the bedroom and says to Esther (who is not seen) ""she's at it again Esther"" or something like that.  Corby would not be seen again until the end of the 6th season in Will Geer's last episode before his death.  The show would,never be the same after this season, although it would still be good.  But this is the first season where we see the series showing its age.",1522368000,,2126,4.76986301369863

8170775,2,B000MQ58WM,Very disappointed in this product. One of the supposedly brand new DVD's arrived with a HUGE gouge all the way around the dvd and it won't play.  I spent nearly $30 for something that won't play and I'm very angry.  It would be nice if this was replaced at no charge especially since it was a gift for someone else.,1513641600,,315,4.233333333333333
8170776,5,B000MQ58WM,"I never saw the original Waltons; we started watching these in Alaska when we didn't have cable TV.  They're good because sometimes we don't feel like watching a 2 hour movie and since each episode is a separate story we don't have to remember ""what happened in the last one.""",1513036800,,276,4.52
