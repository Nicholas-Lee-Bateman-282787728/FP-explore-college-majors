4962546,4,B0066E6SZK,"This collection has some hard-to-find gems - Live, Love and Learn, The Man in Possesion - making it worthy of purchase, but it is enjoyable throughout because of the personality of the leading actor... a great free-spirit! Montgomery has attitude with heart, and a genuine flair for humor. These movies slipped in under the ""code"" and under the radar of contemporary viewers.",1355529600,17,375,5.064516129032258

4962548,3,B0066E6SZK,"""The Robert Montgomery Collection""  pays tribute to a popular leading man of the 1930's and 1940's.  Though his light these days doesn't shine as brightly as that of his M-G-M contemporaries Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, Montgomery projected a debonair charm and seemed most at home in light comedies, though he turned in a chilling performance as a suspected murderer in 1939's ""Night Must Fall.""

His leading ladies included Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, Ingrid Bergman, Susan Hayward, and Carole Lombard.

This four-disc collection contains eight features including ""Shipmates"" (as naval hero John Paul Jones), ""Faithless"" (co-starring Tallulah Bankhead), ""Lovers Courageous"" (as English family black sheep and world traveler), and ""Made on Broadway"" (as a slick, fast-talking press agent).

Also included are ""The Man in Possession,"" ""But the Flesh Is Weak,"" ""Live, Love and Learn,"" and ""The Earl of Chicago.""  There are no bonus extras.",1325462400,16,958,5.527397260273973

8494107,5,B0066E6SZK,"Robert Montgomery was so handsome and so charming, and I think it's a shame he's somewhat forgotten today, like most male stars of that era. This is a good collection of good movies. He's always wonderful in his own 1930s film-acting kind of way, and the movies are short and sweet.",1491091200,4,282,4.549019607843137

8494110,4,B0066E6SZK,"This is really a 3.5 review.  Better than ""it's okay"" but not sure I completely 'liked' it.  I 'kinda liked it' fits best.

YOU must be a fan of Montgomery already.  To the point you'll see ANYTHING he appeared in.  This is 8 big helpings of 'anything'.  As long as you're okay that this set is very uneven, you'll enjoy it.  As long as you're also okay most of these melodramas debate the theme of romance vs. finance, you're good to go.  One film proudly professes LOVE CONQUERS ALL, another refutes it with WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, and the remainder are muddled somewhere in between.

Just don't think these are 8 of his best films.  Not even close.  But I've really grown to love this man's charisma.  I grew up on his daughter and now see where she got it.  Only one film made me wince at it's confused tale -- EARL OF CHICAGO -- and so don't save that for last as the set offers.",1445385600,8,891,4.201183431952662

8494112,5,B0066E6SZK,"There are eight movies in four DVDs and all movies are great to watch, especially Faithless (1932), which is my favorite movie of Tallulah Bankhead. Most of these movies are very rare and even TCM cable channel do not air some of them. I highly recommend these DVDs to all the fans of Robert Montgomery, Tallulah Bankhead and the movies of golden era. A brief summary is as follows:

Faithless (1932): Tallulah Bankhead was loaned to MGM by Paramount for this 1932 classic. This is a highly underrated film that casts Tallulah Bankhead opposite Robert Montgomery in this ""riches to rags"" story at the height of great depression. Her flamboyant personality and uninhibited performances on and off the stage kept many on a vicarious spree until Paramount brought her back from England to United States in 1931. The cameras dimmed luster and crowd magnetism of Bankhead in this drama who otherwise loved to please fans by her witty dialogue. This story is a real family drama where a wife has to do unthinkable of practicing the oldest profession to take care of her dying husband. In the pre-code era, stories such as this were handled with relative ease and Tallulah Bankhead offers the finest performance of her career in a real dramatic story. This just proves that she can do both comedies and drama equally well.

This is the story of a successful female banker (Bankhead) who falls in love with a young debonair (Robert Montgomery) and then marries him. When the shady economic practices of Wall Street firms cause the economy to collapse (1929), they face financial hardship especially when Montgomery becomes ill and unable to care for his wife. This is a well scripted movie for the screen written by Carey Wilson based on Mildred Cram's novel. The movie is directed by Harry Belmont with lot of sensitivity and care. This is a gem and I highly recommend watching this movie.

In Shipmates (1931), Montgomery was promoted to a full stardom in which he casts as a young sailor. He is subjected to bullying by a petty officer played by Ernest Torrence when he is romancing an officer's daughter played by Dorothy Jordan. The ocean cinematography done by Clyde DeVinna was rated as one of the best in 1931. Montgomery sparkled again during the same year in another MGM movie, The Man in Possession (1931), opposite Charlotte Greenwood, and supporting cast included Aubrey Smith, Reginald Owen and Irene Purcell. In this movie, Montgomery poses as a butler, a story based on H.M. Harwood's play and the dialogue was written by P. G. Wodehouse. In Lovers Courageous (1932), Montgomery plays a black sheep of the family leaves his home to become a playwright until he meets an admiral's daughter and fall in love with her. In Live, Love and Learn (1937), Montgomery plays a poor artist interested in painting until he meets a rich socialite played by Rosalind Russell. They fall in love and get married until his life turns into a different direction in which he becomes obsessed with making money.

Robert Montgomery started with movies at the right time when studios started making talkies since 1929. This was an advantage for him since he never did silent movies. Many silent stars were left out of the movie industry when talkies became popular and they suffered because of this transition. Tallulah Bankhead with her rich stage experience and Robert Montgomery's debonair look; both succeeded at the box office. This is a good purchase for your movie library.",1404259200,13,3466,4.879456706281833
