8484194,5,B0006OU65Y,"The first and best DVD from Augie T. Hard to find more.  It will be a historical key point in the history of local comedy like Frank Delima, Andy Bumatai, and Rap Reiplinger.",1411603200,,174,4.2727272727272725
8484195,5,B0006OU65Y,"I loved this video. Braddah Auggie is so funny, right there next to Andy Bumatai. I am very proud of this Local Boy and hope he continues to make it big and represent Hawai'i.
A Must see",1231718400,,186,4.054054054054054
8484196,5,B0006OU65Y,"In his sellout performance at the Hawaii Theatre, Augie T. proves that he is one of, if not the best comedians in Hawaii. From the beginning of the show to the ""first ever"" Hana Hou of a comedian, you will be rolling in your seat. For any local person, this DVD is a must have that you will watch over and over again.",1116028800,2,317,4.0476190476190474
8484197,5,B0006OU65Y,"Augie T. Live is the best comedy DVD I've seen in a long time. His material is hilarious and original. It's great to find a comedy DVD that the whole family can watch together. My 11-year-old laughed til he cried. The extreme make-over bit had us rollin'.

I whole-heartedly recommend this outrageously funny DVD to anyone in search of some serious laughs!",1107475200,3,356,4.741935483870968
8484198,5,B0006OU65Y,"Augie T. is the hottest rising star in comedy today. He has what it takes to make it world wide -- meaning the ability to make the audience laugh. REALLY laugh! That healing belly laugh that just shakes away all your cares and releases any tension is what this dvd produces. I saw the show and enjoyed it so much, I got the dvd right there and watched it as soon as I got home! He is just so funny! Augie T.'s comparison between the local Hawaiian guys (mokes) and midwestern guys is so dead-on accurate! I grew up in the midwest and now live in Hawaii--that really hit home! Do yourself a favor and buy this dvd; it has universal appeal. You will not be disappointed. It is good, clean, healing fun!",1106352000,5,700,4.2706766917293235
