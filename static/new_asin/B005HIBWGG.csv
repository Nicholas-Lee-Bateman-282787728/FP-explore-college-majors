4700432,4,B005HIBWGG,"i saw this movie when it was first released and even though there are some parts where the authenticity lacks a bit, it is still a decent war movie.  It was good to see this film on DVD and to be able to purchase a copy of it.",1389052800,,226,3.7083333333333335
4700433,5,B005HIBWGG,"Little known classic, intentionally over the top performance by Malcolm McDowell.  Brilliant cast.  I saw this movie when it first came out in a theatre and scenes from it have lingered with me for over 30 years.  I am thrilled that it is now out on DVD.",1383436800,,254,4.361702127659575
4700434,4,B005HIBWGG,"Many classic actors are in the film, but the story is weak despite good actors who is doing their part. Still watchable. The picture is not so sharp and the widescreen picture is a little bit weird here and there.",1382832000,,213,4.35
4700435,5,B005HIBWGG,"I saw this movie nearly 30 years ago in Europe, and have been looking for a copy ever since.
Excellent performance by Quinn and Macdowell.
Recommend Lucky Man... if you can find it, that is.",1373500800,,190,4.457142857142857
4700436,2,B005HIBWGG,"Malcolm McDowell plays an evil Nazi and doesn't even do that very well. The rest of the movie is pretty irrelevant.

Spanish peasant farmer is recruited to bring some guy wanted by the Nazis (never did figure out why), across the Pyrenees from France into Spain. Wanted man insists on bringing his family with him (any resemblance to the Sound of Music is purely coincidental).

Lots of, stupid action shots (trains exploding when shot at with a machine gun), unexplained events (why was the train full of resistance fighters), ridiculous over dramatic clips (pouring 2 cans of gasoline on a peasant during war time, reminiscing about the 3rd Reich in the middle of the interrogation of a prisoner), and a terrible ending (you are going to die in a few seconds).

MM was the only character worth watching, every other name appeared to want to get this rubbish over with asap.

At least there was no singing.",1331164800,2,907,4.75796178343949
4700437,5,B005HIBWGG,"At long long last this war film is out on the best disc you can buy,well done to MGM limited edtion for sourcing the best copy. If ever a movie needed a WIDESCREEN ratio this one`s it. Mainly due to the snowy location shooting,you need a big screen tv to view the vast openness. That said please be advised this is far from a great war film,infact it`s a 1970`s b-movie made on a fair size budget due to four big named star`s in it,and even this dvd still shows some wear on the original print,before this only on one of the worst pan and scan vhs video tapes I have ever seen,about a year ago then came out on a very bad region 2 spanish release,as you will see from other reviewers do not buy that one. However if like me you are a film buff and want the best then buy this disc,so far MGM limited edtion discs have been very good,I have about 6 of them and none have let me down,did read THE SATAN BUG was a bit of a dog dvd wise,but I already have a good copy so cannot comment. The dvd here is in mono sound which is ok if you have a good hdmi A/V amp,as for the story if you have not seen before it`s just about watchable,Anthony Quinn and James Mason hold the film up to ok,but Malcom Mcdowell pulls it down to the pits,his acting just wants you to throw a brick at the screen,however if you get past that the last 30 mins chase across the mountains keeps the film going,just ok late night viewing,which is how we first saw it on video tape 30 plus years ago.",1317427200,3,1466,4.058620689655172
4700438,5,B005HIBWGG,"Excellent action packed movie, highly recommended for adults. You will sit at the edge of your couch throughout the entire movie. However, it's not suitable for little children. The movie excellently portrays the sadistic evil in the nazi SS. They had no conscience.

The quality of this video is superb.",1317340800,,304,5.08
4700439,1,B005HIBWGG,"after paying a premium price for this product, to my disappointment never expected the print to be so horrible, it is the worst video print i have ever seen and i am not even sure if the disc is original or a copy. please do not buy this product, i would request a genuine version if possible",1305590400,10,292,4.140350877192983

8473062,1,B005HIBWGG,"""The Passage"" is not the WWII 'gem' you might think you missed--like I did. It is an atrocious film that I cannot understand how could rate 5 stars, but everybody is entitled to their opinion. Anthony Quinn is approached by the underground to lead an important geman scientist over the Pyrenees Mountains to escape the Nazi's. Sounds promising enough right? The scientist (James Mason well past his prime here), also includes his Wife (Patricia Neal, WAY past her prime & completely wasted), his son, and Kay Lenz as his daughter. Add to that Malcolm McDowell as a crazed Nazi chasing them over the mountains and you have the ingredients for an okay thriller or so I'd hoped. Instead, what you get is a 'mess'. And you also get, be forewarned, Kay Lenz, nude, topless, gorgeous, in a sexual assault scene with ""butt-naked"" Malcolm McDowell. What this scene has to do with the plot I don't know and its tasteless to boot. The film goes on until you get 3 different endings for some reason only explained at IMDB. Don't waste your money (like I did) on this 'classic', its a disaster.",1458604800,,1082,4.670157068062827
8473063,5,B005HIBWGG,"Reviews are mixed for this film, but I like it. My spouse gifted it to me. I've always enjoyed this film. The story is a gripping one. I already have this movie on VHS and wanted a DVD. The audio and quality work nicely. The film was underrated when it was released due to the cold weather setting, but a great cast made it enjoyable. Malcolm McDowall goes all out as the villainous SS officer. Anthony Quinn and Christopher Lee round out the cast along with Patrician Neal and James Mason.
Overall, if you enjoy thrillers or WWII films, there is no real reason not to like this one.",1448755200,,583,4.3577981651376145
8473064,5,B005HIBWGG,Excellent,1446940800,,9,9.0
8473065,5,B005HIBWGG,"This is a well made, taught thriller based during WW2. Wonderful acting by a great cast. Saw this movie at the cinema 30+ years ago. Brought back wonderful memories. Print quality is excellent. Lack of English sub titles, during German dialogue, does not take much away as what they are referring to is obvious. A great movie which shows the courage of the French underground that sacrificed so much and so many members for victory. Malcolm MacDowel plays the Nazi SS officer to perfection.",1410393600,,490,4.845238095238095
