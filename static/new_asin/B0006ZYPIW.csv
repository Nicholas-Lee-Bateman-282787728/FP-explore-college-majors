8044299,5,B0006ZYPIW,"This is a very pleasant video done by an ""Englisher"" or someone outside of the Amish community. There is a nice section about the history of the Amish, Mennonite and Hutterite communites spoken by a Mennonite woman as she explains a large wall mural that depicts the history of these faith communities. This video takes the viewer traveling along farm lanes and around the community and has a good interview of a young man who joined and later left the community. The ""Englisher"" is careful to be sensitive and kind in his presentation. This is wholesome viewing for anyone of any age.",1222646400,6,585,4.745098039215686
