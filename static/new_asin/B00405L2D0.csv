8412127,2,B00405L2D0,The whole movie takes place in a backyard swimming pool area revolving around 4 men and their relationships/lives during their 30-40 years.  The location is a West Hollywood backyard.  Time:  days of the clam-shell with antenna phone.  Not high drama nor suspense.  Possibly entertaining for a few.,1399334400,,298,5.25531914893617
8412128,1,B00405L2D0,"Remarkably unfunny comedy about shallow, commitment-phobic gay guy David who suddenly realizes he is forty and doesn't want to be alone.  So he invites three of his equally shallow, commitment-phobic gay friends for a late summer pool party, where they frolic by the poolside, splash in the water and talk about sex (eagerly) and commitment (scathingly).  Of course their fun is interrupted by all sorts of zany characters:  nosy neighbors, interfering mothers, pizza delivery boys, obnoxious sisters and pre-pubescent nephews.  A sorrier bunch of men, make that children, never existed.  The best line comes when David gives his nephew some sage advice:  ""Don't be in a hurry to grow up.""  That pretty much sums up David and his friends.

A movie doesn't necessarily need characters you care about, but it should have characters you're interested in, and this one doesn't.  Comedies don't need much of a plot, but they should be funny, or at least amusing.  If you're into watching marginally good-looking guys in swimsuits played by bad actors, reciting bad dialogue, then ""Pooltime"" is the movie for you.  If you're interested in a movie with anything more visit someone else's party.",1325894400,,1187,5.130208333333333
8412129,4,B00405L2D0,"This movie is about long term relationships in the gay community.  You know, that point in time, usually 40, where you stop going to the clubs and think to yourself, ""What the hell am I doing?""  This film totally succeeds in broaching that sensitive subject.  And the beefcake ain't hard on the eyes, either!

PS: How long can these guys stay underwater without taking a breath?  Six minutes?  Haha.",1301270400,6,399,4.7101449275362315
8412130,3,B00405L2D0,"Answering the age-old question, ""What happens to former West Hollywood gay party boys when they start approaching age 40?"" (Personally, I always thought some kind of spontaneous combustion was involved...), ""Pooltime"" (2010) is a pleasant but lightweight romantic comedy that looks into what a midlife crisis feels like, surrounded by a community and town that is youth obsessed.

David is a successful, handsome, buff man in his late 30's, who comes to realize he is missing what he really wants: a stable, lasting relationship with a nice guy. Thinking of missed opportunities, he throws a small pool party for three of his closest (and equally attractive) friends near his age, to see if he notices some mutual interest or a relationship sparks. Of course, his plans don't go smoothly, as they are interrupted by the mother of one of his guests, his sister who wants him to babysit his nephew, a couple of straight neighbors, and a pizza boy who delivers some really bad timing.

Not that much of a plot here, but some interesting characters that many gay men (even those of us who don't live in WeHo) may find familiar, and perhaps a bit disturbing on some level.  Kudos to Michael Donahue (writer/director) for having the courage to release a film with fully-nuanced older gay characters, played by capable age-appropriate actors.  Three stars out of five.",1293494400,7,1361,4.956140350877193
