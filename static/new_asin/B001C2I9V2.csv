8285707,5,B001C2I9V2,"Bought this dvd used, and I believe there must have been a series of these, but I can't confirm this on amazon.com, but basically there doesn't need to be a part two or three, this covers the restoration of a convertable's rusted out floorpan area, I think I remember it as a buick convertible, they cover the proper method of welding with a simple wire feed mig welder, how to do a complete seem weld in of a replacement floor pan set to replace a badly welded one/rusted out one, and how to freshen up shoddy amateur repairs of poor welding practice, of which I am guilty of myself, I mean, when you get to zapping rust holes with a wire feed welder you can forget that the proper repair for a panel is just complete replacement, I mean it saves you time, and even though I've owned a lincoln sp100 lincoln 115volt wire feed welder(.023 wire and CO2 shielding gas)for about eighteen years, I learned from this video, practiced on an old rusted out datsun pickup.  I believe the video alluded to a second dvd to finish up their restoration project, maybe it is available through Hot Rod Magazine, but frankly, with this just one video, you can really learn alot, the folks doing the work are real pro's, who really know what they are doing cause it seems they've done it for a paycheck for years.
When it comes to classic cars, I don't get to play in that arena myself these days, but I have done some nifty cost saving repairs for many old vehicles over the years I've owned, and when I've sold them, the new owners could be rest assured that the repairs I made were with simple decent repairs in metal, AND NOT BONDO except to smooth over minor imperfections, of which I tire of seeing classic rods and resale vehicles slathered in bondo magic to fool the unknowing prospective buyer, I mean, wire feed welding is something that is very easy to do, I did some repairs to that old recent project, that datsun pickup, with hand operated metal snips plyers, making some floorboards from sheetmetal salvaged from an old dishwasher, rebuilt rusted out firewall so it don't leak inside from out, it aint hard, and I'm not a pro.",1286150400,,2125,4.4909560723514215
