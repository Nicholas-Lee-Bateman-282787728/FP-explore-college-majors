8356475,3,B0028O9YBM,"Lemmon goes to Italy because his father died there and he's going to bring back the body for burial. What he doesn't know is that he died with his British mistress, whom he saw every year for about a month. The daughter is also journeying there to bring back her mother's body. The hotel staff was very fond of his father and girlfriend. Anyway, Lemmon plays a hyperactive Type A personality industrialist that has to deal with the Italian bureaucracy.
