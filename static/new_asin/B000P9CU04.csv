8593434,4,B000P9CU04,"This is a great video. I also highly recommend Paul Frederick's previous video ""Adirondack Visions"" which I think is an even better video.

Here is the description from the back of the DVD case: Celebrate the spectacular beauty of the Adirondack mountains of upstate New York with music, poetry and the videography of award winning photo-journalist Paul Frederick in Adirondack Wild.

Shot in digital widescreen video, Adirondack Wild is a visually stunning journey to the wild places of the Adirondack region. Featuring music and poetry by the Scott B. Adams Acoustic Ensemble and Chris Shaw & John Kirk. Adirondack Wild is the follow up to the highly acclaimed Adirondack Visions program, and will transport you to the tranquil edge of a whispering brook, the summit of a mountain peak and the heart of a forest in full fall color. Whether you were born and raised in the Adirondacks or just share a passion for the region, this is one program you'll want to see again and again.

Special features include producer commentary, ""Making The Music"" with Scott B. Adams and Chris Shaw & John Kirk, and extra footage not seen on the PBS broadcast.",1221609600,2,1144,4.88659793814433
