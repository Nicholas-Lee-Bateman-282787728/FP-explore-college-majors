It goes to prove-you stand up for what you believe in, a cause, and you can go down fighting for it!  My kind of story exactly!  Rates 5 stars!",949622400,2,265,3.6964285714285716
1026962,5,630542828X,"I read the Book ""A Civil Action"" by Jonathan Harr And I have to say it was superb! It's definitely not your regular Story.",949536000,,122,4.125
1026963,3,630542828X,"As a lawyer and someone who read the book before seeing the movie, I highly recommend that you buy the book rather than this movie.  While the movie does somewhat accurately depict what happened, it really minimizes  the serious and close relationships that Jan Schl..(travolta's  character)developed with his clients, and also barely gets into how much  time Jan spent researching and developing this case.",948153600,,407,5.3125
1026964,2,630542828X,"According to the reviews on Amazon I stood a good chance of buying a great movie from my favorite on-line movie store. But alas, this time I was disappointed by the yarn that was spun by Steve Zaillan et al. The movie  was simply too long for what it had to tell. Don't get me wrong: I like a  good long movie when there is a good build-up of suspense or maybe an  in-depth character study that really gets you into the movie. ""A civil  action"" had neither I'm afraid. Although I really like Robert Duvall a  lot, I have to say that the character he plays in this movie is just too  strange to be more than fleetingly interesting. The story winds down from a  good start to a very disappointing anti-climax. The people who are at the  heart of this story (the parents of the children that have died of various  polution-related diseases) are markedly absent and this alone renders the  movie inadequate and frankly, a waste of time.",947548800,5,932,4.39766081871345

This legal story , based on a true case, keeps focus on the sacrifice made by a small time legal firm battling the forces behind bigtime commercial pollution. This skillfully made film should be a model for many others because it does not descend into romance or other Hollywood stuff. We strive and suffer along with Travolta, Macy, Shaloub as they meet the expenses of a major lawsuit.

A lot of important information is left out, and a lot of the quotes and actions were done by others and not the characters in the movie.

1027812,5,630542828X,"John Travolta plays the successful cliched personal injury lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann, who encounters a case that changes his outlook on the meaning of success.

This movie is based on the true story of a leather company that dumped industrial solvent into the water table of Woburn, MA, for a decade, and was believed to be the cause or contributor to the deaths of about a dozen citizens. Although Schlichtmann's original reasons for not dropping the case were not entirely honorable, there were two giant parent companies involved that could yield a huge payday, Schlichtmann eventually loses everything -- his money, his firm, his partners, his friends -- in pursuing this case for ultimately the right reasons.

William H. Macey, Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub (you know him as ""Monk), Zeljko Ivanek, Kathleen Quinlan, James Gandolfini, and John Lithgow give their usual fine performances in supporting roles. Robert Duvall directed the film and plays the attorney for Beatrice Foods who will never allow Beatrice to see the light of day in a courtroom. Sydney Pollack in a cameo plays Al Eustis, the CEO of W.H. Grace, who offers a last-ditch settlement to Schlichtmann to end the case.

The plot appears to progress to a dark and depressing conclusion, but the final scenes offer redemption, hope and a satisfying ending. The delivery of the second summons to the Beatrice Foods attorney (Robert Duvall) at his secret lunchtime hiding spot in the basement stacks of his law firm is priceless.

I liked this movie very much and give it 5-stars.",1447545600,,1546,5.02734375

After mortgaging everything they have, and using personal savings the firm disburses and they are forced into an $8M settlement to pay off loans and divide a modest amount between the affected families.  Feeling that he isn't satisfied with the outcome, he sends paperwork to the EPA, as proof that Grace and Beatrice Foods have presented false information to the EPA about the way the contaminates have been collected and disbursed.  John Travolta is very good in his role, but I feel Jan Schlictmann should have looked for other means (larger law firms) to backup his defense for his defendants.",1424736000,5,818,5.0

1028349,5,630542828X,"In the early 1980's a terrifying situation was unfolding in the Boston suburb of Woburn, MA.  Within a very short period of time eight of the town's young children had died of leukemia.  The parents of these children were desperate to discover just what was going down in their town.  Many of the townsfolk suspected that the culprit could very well be a tanury located about a half mile from the town's water supply.  For several decades this facility had manufactured a highly toxic chemical known as trichloroethylene or TCE. This was potentially a very emotional and divisive issue in Woburn because many of the residents earned their living at the tanury.  The parents needed a lawyer to help them get to the bottom of all this.

Now at the time Jan Schlichtmann (played by John Travolta) was a highly-successful personal-injury attorney.  His M.O. was to make the insurance company pay up before the matter at hand ever went to trial.  He was darn good at what he did.  Schlichtmann was contacted by Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan), the mother of one of the young victims.  After meeting with a group of the parents Schlichtmann concluded that there was little or no  money to be made from this case and politely turned them down.  Shortly thereafter Mr. Schlichtmann discovered that the site was actually owned by a couple of major American corporations, namely W.R. Grace and Beatrice Food.  Now dollar signs danced in his head and Jan offered to take the case.  He had no idea what he was getting into.

Meanwhile, Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) is the attorney for one of the major corporations who are the defendants in this case.  Facher is a seasoned and articulate attorney who is expert at making his points with a little bit of humor and a  minimum of words.  Despite the fact that he is representing the ""bad guys"" in this case one cannot help but like this charactor.  For me one of the most poignant scenes in this film is when during the course of the trial Facher rattles off a series of questions to one of the grieving parents.  He asks:  ""Do you use pesticides?"" , ""Hairspray?"" , ""Teflon?""  and the list goes on and on.  Facher is effectively making the point that while all of us clamor for clean air and water we also demand thousands of products that require dangerous chemicals in the manufacturing process.  In effect he is asking this conflicted father ""How many of these things are YOU willing to give up to clean up the environment?""  It is a question that begs much soul-searching by us all.

At the end of the day Jan Schlichtmann and his partners at the personal injury law firm (William H. Macy and Tony Shalhoub) risk everything they have on this one case.  It has now become a matter of principle for which all of them will pay a dear price.  For as we discover our legal system is full of booby traps and cozy relationships.  It is hard to buck the system.  I found ""A Civil Action"" to be a gripping movie from start to finish.  I was totally transfixed for the entire two hours.  I think you will be too. I have heard that the book is even better!  Very highly recommended!",1416096000,,3113,4.571428571428571

1028592,5,630542828X,"'A Civil Action' is an entertaining portrayal of personal defense law as well as an interesting depiction of a significant environmental law case.  It portrays much of the anguish from the families in Woburn, as well as the difficulties the (or any) law firm might encounter in trying a case this intricate.  In terms of filmography and acting, I believe everyone played their roles well; the director does well in interjecting humor into a clearly disheartening, but otherwise too-somber-for-hollywood situation.  Though some of the elements are beginning to date themselves (especially the explanatory text referencing Anderson v.

How does that happen?
I think I can partly explain the acting:  You assemble gifted actors and cast them in parts for which they seem uniquely suited.  For example, there was never an actor of higher caliber than Robert Duvall. It is no wonder, then, that with his Louisiana roots and accent, he portrays perfectly a shrewd, Harvard-trained Yankee lawyer. John Travolta, competent and versatile, carries with strength the central character, combining boldness and sensitivity.. William Macy shines as the loyal, practical, long-suffering but anxious partner.

His pursuit ultimately reveals bigger fish - multinational corporations, to fry; however these corporations have legal departments and access to legal ""specialists"" whose size and resources quickly dwarf Travolta's firm, which had seemed more than adequate for the case at the start of the movie.

Unlike the happier endings given to us in truly memorable films like The Verdict and Erin Brokavich, A Civil Action gives us what usually happens in such lawsuits - they go on for years and years, with no resolution, until the plaintiff dies or just quits in frustration.

I am a huge John Travolta fan, but even I was surprised with the depth of character he touches in his portrayal of Jan Schlichtmann: arrogant, cocky and yet ultimately committed to a cause he did not go looking for.

Robert Duvall is as wonderful and effortless as ever.  Despite his character being on the ""wrong"" side, his portrayal forces the viewer to make the distinction between the job a person does and who the person is.

What is sad is the huge number of conservatives/republicans/libertarians who are against all government regulations. They believe in a 'free market' which really means corporations should be allowed to destroy our environment and kill people without any worry from prosecution. Conservatives would love to see all regulations eliminated so that corrupt companies like WR Grace could destroy all the air, land and water in our country. When Bush became governor of Texas it became number one in the country in air, water and land pollution. Because of him tens of thousands of people who were vulnerable either became worse or died. To continue to get campaign cash from corrupt Texas corporations GW Bush gave out 830 exemptions to the worst polluters in the state. He traded the health of every Texan so he could get money from those 830 corrupt corporations to run for governor and later for president.

Conservatives and libertarians want to see our country destroyed. They want to see a WR Grace in every town in American destroying environments and peoples' lives. Conservatives/republicans/libertarians cling to their ignorance like monkeys clinging to a coconut filled with seeds. Many tribes get a coconut, hollow it out, put seeds inside of it and then tie a long rope to it. When the monkey reaches his hand in to form a fist over the seeds he can't withdraw his paw because it's still in a fist and he won't let go, even though he can see people approaching with a net to catch him. Conservatives/republicans/libertarians are exactly like that monkey when it comes to ignorance. They run from truth or facts and remained mired in a cesspool of lies and misinformation they hear on right wing hate radio and faux news.

But their profound ignorance will lead to the end of our country if they are allowed to continue their assaults against every institution in this country designed to protect the citizenry. They believe in a dog eat dog world where vulnerable people should be preyed upon, just like WR Grace preyed upon their unsuspecting victims in this movie.

What is sad are the huge number of conservative republicans/libertarians who profess to be 'christians', but who hate other people and worship corporations, like WR Grace. How can anyone be a christian and a conservative is beyond comprehension. Conservatives hate everything Jesus taught or stood for. Conservative Christians is an oxymoron. No one can be a PRACTICING christian and a conservative at the same time. They are exact opposites.

I highly recommend this movie for its entertainment value and for its social commentary on what we need to do to fight the disease of conservatism/libertarianism/republicanism who are all mutations of the the same selfish, hateful and spiteful people who constantly seek to destroy the lives of others.

They must borrow money from a bank for expenses. One employee tells more to Jan. Another man tells what they did: just dumped it in the ground. Most cases are settled not tried. Jan gives his price for a settlement. Too high?

Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta) is a Boston tort lawyer and something of an ambulance chaser who is initially reluctant to take on an industrial pollution case involving some children dead of leukemia in rural New England. He changes his mind when he realizes the likely defendants are a couple of big companies with particularly deep pockets and smells the possibility of serious money. Over time, however his interest in the case becomes a moral obsession. The cynical becomes a crusader, refusing offers to settle as his company's finances spiral downwards towards bankruptcy.
If you like courtroom dramas, this is highly recommended. It's one of the best specimens of the genre to come out of America since `The Verdict'. It's interesting to compare it to `Erin Brockovich' released a couple of years later. EB is about how a heroic small timer takes on the big boys of corporate America and how her pluck and determination triumphs over all obstacles, something of a legal feelgood movie in other words. Which this, to its great credit, is not. Its central character, for starters, is far more amibivalently likeable: initially just out for a fast buck, moral seriousness has to creep up on him and take him by surprise (perhaps reminding writer/director Zaillian of Oskar Schindler whose story he scripted for Spielberg a few years earlier) and the story's development paints a significantly more ambivalent picture of what pluck and determination can accomplish. It's a highpoint of Travolta's acting career even if he is comprehensively upstaged by Robert Duvall, on brilliant form as his quietly cynical adversary, bigshot lawyer Jerome Facher who knows far better than to look for the truth in a courtroom...

1028910,4,630542828X,"(1) A Civil Action is a 1998 film, starring John Travolta (as plaintiff's attorney Jan Schlichtmann) and Robert Duvall, based on the book of the same name by Jonathan Harr. Both the book and the film  are based on the real-life case of Anderson v. Cryovac that took place in Woburn, Massachusetts in the 1980s.

(2) John Travolta plays a tort lawyer part of  tort law firm making millions from large corporations by filing personal injuries on behalf of their clients.

(3) He is intellectually attracted (seeing the the financial jackpot and oppurtunity to make millions for his firm and partners) to a case about a large corporation polluting the waters of a small town which incidentally shows a high rise of deaths due to cancer.

(4) Travolta law firm tries to proove that the deaths due the cancer of the many residents of that down were actually due to the consumption of the water from the river where the toxic waste from the company were dumped.

(5) In a surprising move , and totally against his nature he decides against taking a reasonably sizable sum of money as settlement (from the corporation) on behalf of the town dwellers to end the case there which would have left Travolta and his partners with sizable monies and would have also left his clients some money. But the clients are not after money, they are after truth and want justice to be served against the large corporation.

(6) The  culprit in question are actually 2 companies of which Robert Duvall is the attorney for one of the companies.

(6) Having turned down the offer and having decided to go on the righteous route of litigations for justice and truth, he sinks his whole law firm into bankruptcy fighting the case; His partners leave him (one of whom is William H Macy)

(7) ' An underdog against the large corporation' film

I won't call it the best legal thriller of our times like the DVD jacket proclaims, but it is certainly an above par legal thriller churned out of Hollywood. Travolta surprisingly suits the role very well.

1028912,3,630542828X,"I'll be completely honest here.  I saw `A Civil Action' because I am in love with James Gandolfini.  Sadly his character has very little screen time although he is quite convincing with what he has to work with.  What I found though was a nice little court room drama that is interesting as much as it is frustrating and deserves at least a little attention.  This movie is by no means a brilliant film, but it does sport a few excellent performances that help elevate the plot and leave the audience at least satisfied with the overall effect of the film.

`A Civil Action' is based on a true story of the small town of Woburn Massachusetts where two large corporations through carelessness and negligence poisoned the drinking water thus resulting in the deaths of eight children.  The town hires Jan Schlichtmann, a personal injury attorney, to find out what killed their children and get them an apology.  Money is not important to them, but as Schlichtmann points out, money is how these corporations apologize.  Jan, who was initially apposed to the case, becomes personally invested which, as he brings out, is the worst thing a lawyer can do.  As he goes to battle with the lawyers for the two corporations, WR Grace and Beatrice Foods, it appears he may be in way over his head.

Where the movie shines is in interaction between Schlichtmann and rival lawyer Jerome Facher, thanks in large part to the performances by both Travolta and Duvall.  John Travolta may play Schlichtmann almost a polar opposite to the actual man himself, but this to me helps aid the film along.  Travolta is very cool and collected here, very polished and confident and that helps the audience feel drawn to him.  He's going after what he believes in and no one will stop him and that is a very endearing or at least admirable quality.  Robert Duvall is the perfect complement to Travolta here.  He gives Facher so much charisma that the viewer can't keep their eyes and mind off of him.  His performance is brilliantly executed and well deserving of the Oscar nomination.

Where the movie falters though is the one place I was really hoping that it would shine and that is of the aftermath of the events on the survivors.  Don't get me wrong, the performances by the likes of Kathleen Quinlan and James Gandolfini are excellent and portray enough pain and even quilt but they are limited in their effectiveness because so much focus is shifted to the battle between lawyers.  It would have been nice to have the focus more on the families and their struggle for answers.  If this had been the focal point of the movie I think it would have transcended the average legal drama and become something much more.

The performances throughout are all commendable, not just those of Travolta, Duvall, Quinlan and Gandolfini.  William H. Macy especially deserves some commendation.  His portrayal of James Gordon is brilliant.  John Lithgow is also exceptionally good as Judge Walter J. Skinner.  He's very powerful, and that's not something I expected from him.  Sydney Pollack is great in his cameo, no matter how small his scene is, and delivers with expert conviction and Dan Hedaya is very hate-worthy as the malicious and selfish John Riley.  Tony Shalhoub and Zelijko Ivanek (who I just LOVED on `Damages') are sorely underused as Schlichtmann and Gordon's partners Kevin Conway and Bill Crowley; in fact I think I only heard Ivanek utter like two sentences.

In the end `A Civil Action' is one of those movies that will not disappoint but it will not outstand either.  Aside from some on point acting it is truly a generic and formulistic film that has been done before, and better I might add, but it won't leave you wishing you hadn't wasted your time either.  Watch this for the legal banter and brilliance that is Duvall but don't expect too much in regards to a real emotional drama for, like Schlichtmann advises, the audience is never really allowed to get personally invested.",1193616000,5,3972,4.7562043795620434

1028950,5,630542828X,"This is a very underrated movie. A Hollywood courtroom drama that manages almost totally to avoid clich...? One for the scrapbook maybe. What I liked most about it was almost the complete lack of explanation about motivation ( shades of David Lynch here perhaps) most notably in the Schlichtmann character, brilliantly underplayed by John Travolta. Who could ever have imagined that being said? Indeed all the top stars (+Duvall, Macy, Shaloub) rein in on the histrionics, which is one reason why you have to watch this. What really made him change from a typical materialistic lawyer into people's hero willing to risk everything for, well, you make your mind up? The word hero is out of place here, however, and perhaps more disturbingly also so is villain, as the film does deal with a terrible crime. But then perhaps the banality of crime is what it is all about. Or should be.

Whatever your view, you will not go away without thinking about some very searching questions concerning the relationship between the law, justice and human suffering. The film ends with perhaps one of the finest pauses in cinema, as Travolta, faced with bankruptcy, attempts in vain to answer the judge's question: Where did it all go?

1028951,5,630542828X,"This movie tells part of the story, Hollywood style, of the Woburn contamination legal saga which took place in the eighties as a wave of toxic tort lawsuits were sweeping the nation. Trichloretylene (TCE), a common de-greaser, Toluene and some other chemicals were dumped after use or leaked through pipes and other sources into the public water supply including wells around Woburn, MA. A number of plaintiffs filed suit claiming an abnormal number of leukemia and other health related issues. This movie focuses on the hardships faced by the people and their lawyers as they fought against lying employees of large companies, crafty lawyers and insensitive judges. While some of the movie is true, as is often the case with a Hollywood dramatization of so-called true events, much has been left out of the story.

For one thing, the movie fails to mention the scientific controversy over whether in fact TCE is harmful at all. Indeed, TCE was once the decafinating agent of coffee and was used in dry cleaning processes. Other communities around the country faced similar exposure to TCE with no noted adverse health effects whatsoever. While Toluene, a nasty chemical with known adverse health effects, was also involved in Woburn, this movie focuses on TCE, a chemical sometimes compared by toxicologists to have similar health effects to peanut butter and red wine.

Robert Duvall, John Travolta and William H. Macy deliver outstanding performances in this movie. And while Hollywood may have over-dramaticized certain aspects of the case, Travolta's observations during narrative over dubs about trial processes in general are insightful and largely accurate. It's a good movie, even if one side is portrayed more sympathetically than the other. But then, that's Hollywood.",1149033600,5,1780,5.242105263157895

The DVD brings out the cinematography which is very, very good and the picture is razor-sharp. One of Hollywood''s Hall Of Fame photographers, Conrad Hall, shot this film. Story-wise, the courtroom scenes were the most dramatic of the film but this story dealt more with the behind-the-scenes digging of information to expose thoughtless businessmen who had dumped poison in an area and people were suffering because of it. It is supposedly-based on a true story.

Another big highlight of this movie is great performance by John Travolta, perhaps his best work ever. Just the pauses and looks on his face alone greatly enhanced his performance. He was just fascinating. Language-wise, this is pretty tame except for William H. Macy, who loses his cool a few times as the assistant lawyer/financial man for the law firm battling the polluters.

1) Whitey Bulger's brother has as an attorney the same man whose firm employed Jan Schlictmann, in this movie. Additionally, the names of principles being smeared in the case largely hail from the same county as Woburn: John Connelly,Robert Morris,Dennis Condon,Frank Salemme, H.Paul Rico,Sonny Mercurio,etc. Consider that the Bulger case fomented in sync with the appearance of this book!

2) Did the entrenched military-industrial complex feel that JFK was boosting space while dunking military budgets? As bases were being reviewed for closure, a small group of workmen appeared at the Portsmouth Naval yard from the Boston Navy Yard just before work was completed and the USS Thresher sank. Later testimony was said to have alleged 20% of the back-pressure relief valves were installed backwards, which could have caused the sub to explode/implode. Could JFK's pro-peace, pro-space economy shifting have caused a scramble to save a local base at any cost? Also,JFK was personally involved in authorizing Woburn as a future NASA site in the region of the polluted land.

3)How many WR Grace employees who did not pollute and may even have aggressively tried to prevent this were fired or lost substantial savings as the company tanked in the wake of this book? In the aftermath of this case,how would companies like Beatrice and Grace feel about conscientious employees? What protections do such individuals have from such entities as EPA or OSHA,if any?

4) Was one individual involved with a major company in this book told to help with a software development program and in fact was enrolled in a study with Omnitech International and shuffled between participating companies in the experiment and always traceable by government agencies represented in those companies?",1141257600,,1924,5.176848874598071

No hope to recuperate your eyes, not even one, when you have been blinded by the corporate delinquent that lives on the other side of the road. No hope and yet some lawyer maybe might be on the track and might catch that delinguent corporate criminal and get some damages for the damage he caused. But there is such a narrow chance it may work, you may prefer to, you might have rather stop the whole machine and cry in your corner, try to forget the damage for which no damages will be enough.

1029004,4,630542828X,"In A Civil Action John Travolta plays Jan Schlichtmann the hottest young lawyer in Boston. He is a personal claims lawyer with a successful small practice and he is one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Boston. Jan will do anything to win a case. During the progression of the story, he narrates advice to the audience as if a he is a law professor. It is this instruction that he himself does not follow and thus leads to trouble for himself and his clients. The movie, in this way, is almost as much about the apparently unreasonable reason behind litigation then it is about the individual case it portrays.
 We are introduced to the way Jan Schlichtmann operates in a dark yet amusing prologue. This shows Schlichtmann pushing one of his unfortunate clients into court, fixing his pillows, getting him a drink, and wiping his face. All while the jury tries to choke back their tears, and the defending lawyers frantically try to settle before the trial begins by writing increasingly large settlements on a pad for Schlichtmann's approval. While this is all going on Schlichtmann gives a brilliantly deadpan voiceover, explaining how much you can expect to receive for various types of injury and which types of clients are worth more in winning cases. He concludes ""that whites are worth more than blacks, men more than women, the rich more than the poor and a long agonizing death over a quick one. A white male professional in his 40's, in his prime earning potential, is worth the most and a dead child is worth least of all.""
 Everything is going well for Jan and then a case with at least 10 dead children drops into his lap. This case is known as an ""orphan"" as it has landed in every prominent lawyer's office and all have passed on it prior to him. But Schlichtmann's firm takes on the case when he discovers that culprits are owned by two of America's major corporations WR Grace and Beatrice Foods. But for the families, money isn't the point, and all they want to know is what happened, and for the responsible parties to come over and apologize to them for their loss. The thing is, ""corporations apologize with money,"" and if the corporations have deep pockets, it's a case worth taking, so money does indeed become the point in A Civil Action. From then on, we get to watch a characteristic David versus Goliath clash, which involves the lawyer with his limited team and funds and the huge corporation with unlimited resources and a very clever lawyer (Jerome Fasher) heading its case.
 Schlichtmann does a couple things during the case that leads ultimately to his downfall. First, he gets personally involved. In a news broadcast, he holds up snaps of the Woburn kids who have died. He shows empathy, which is a grave disservice to the legal profession because it clouds his judgment. He says it's like a doctor recoiling at the sight of blood. That leads to his demanding of WR Grace and Beatrice Foods a multi-million dollar settlement, including money for a research foundation, to cover expenses, and to provide for the families for thirty years, which the corporations refuse, which in turn takes the case to trial. He does this without consulting his partners, which doesn't sit well. James Gordon, the accountant, points out that they need to work on other cases to provide a cash flow. Schlichtmann has sunken a million into the Woburn case, and pretty soon, they teeter on the waterfalls of bankruptcy to the point of mortgaging their homes. It's become a source of pride, which has undone many an attorney as opposed to idiot witnesses, lousy evidence, and the hanging judge put together, as Jerome Fasher (played by Robert Duvall) tells his law class.
 Fasher, the attorney for Beatrice, is a statesman-like man of experience, but has a isolated yet eccentric personality. He is a knowledgeable man, and his observation on the justice system is true, but at times appalling. When Schlichtmann tells him he's searching for the truth, he tells him, ""You've been around long enough to know that a courtroom's not the place to look for the truth."" And he truthfully says that the case stopped being about children the moment Schlichtmann filed for action.
Robert Duvall gives an excellent performance as Jerome Facher, Beatrice's attorney, who is the complete opposite of Schlichtmann. In a scene at a fancy hotel conference room, the frugal Facher is not impressed by any of the lawyers or their arguments, but the free pen that he can take home. It's a subtly funny scene that illustrates Facher perfectly.
 The film does a great job in presenting the feelings and priorities of those injured by the negligence of a corporation. Often people think that money is everything in a civil trial, but this example shows that that is not always the case. Some of the characters evolve greatly during the story, understanding what is really important and what is superficial. This film initially gives an impression of a film where a greedy lawyer grows a conscience and starts out on a quest to defend the less privileged. But, even though the subject is not new, the way in which the story is presented and the performances by John Travolta, and especially Robert Duvall, make this a decent production nevertheless.
 The blurb on the jacket claims that A Civil Action is ""The best legal thriller ever."" I personally believe this quote does the film a major disservice, because by calling it a ""thriller"" it gives the audience the idea that this is going to be something standard and Hollywood, with the obligatory ""Hollywood"" ending, and it's not. It's based on true events and exposes our legal system bare, it shows the impartial brutality of the adversarial system, and how one man's flaws can be amplified by that system, until they consume not only him, but all those around him.
 Trials and lawsuits are examples of how corrupt and rotten the legal system and some lawyers are. Is it worth having a system where the first party to come to their senses (i.e. to cut their losses and call for a settlement) is the loser? A Civil Action also shows that despite the need for compassion, it's better to have a lawyer who thinks more with the head than the heart. This film shows startling conclusions about our Justice system, and that is what A Civil Action chooses to focus on more so than the true story it tells. The film shows the price of justice and how justice is understood in the legal process. In fact, it draws a very fine dichotomy between non-legal and legal justice and shows how hard it is to get ""justice"" in a legal setting. Needless to say, it becomes a very expensive ordeal full of interpretations of the law and unfortunate manipulations of it. What we can gather from the story, however, is that we should be grateful for people who are willing to go to extreme lengths, at great personal cost, to define justice on their own terms and to fight for it.",1097712000,,6903,4.7284053156146175

Travolta plays Jan Schlichtmann, a successful lawyer that measures everything in terms of money, including the life of others. For example, the perfect victim / client for him is a white male professional in his forties, while the one that has the least worth is no other than a child! Jan is one of Boston's most eligible bachelors and is having a ball; he believes he is above everyone else and does not care about mundane events or tragedies that other people may suffer. One day though, he receives a call from a client while he is on a radio show on air, and has no other option but to follow through on the case; at least so as to look a little better in the public eye.

The case involves kids getting sick, and some dying, due to water wells contaminated with ethylene. Jan knows that since the victims are kids there is no real money in the case, so he is reluctant to take it. But when he is leaving town something catches his eye; the small tannery believed to be the culprit is owned by a huge company with various subsidiary companies, including the producer of Tropicana. From then on, we get to watch a typical David versus Goliath fight, which involves the lawyer with his limited team and funds and the huge corporation with unlimited resources and a very clever lawyer heading its case (Duvall).

1029006,5,630542828X,"Sometime in the late 1960's, a hideous act of pollution took place in Woburn, Massachusetts, a small town north of Boston.  Over the next fifteen years, twelve people died of leukemia.  Eight of those were children.  The firm of Jan Schlichtmann, Kevin Conway, James Gordon, and Bill Crowley take on the case on behalf of Anne Anderson, a woman who lost her child to cancer.  For her, money isn't the point.  All she wants to know is what happened, and for the responsible parties to come over and apologize to her and the other families.  Thing is, corporations apologize with money, and if the corporations have deep pockets, it's a case worth taking, so money does indeed become the point in A Civil Action.

Schlichtmann uncovers the culprits, a chemical company, WR Grace and Beatrice Foods, who provide services for a tanning company owned by Riley.  With that, he files a lawsuit, the legal equivalent to a declaration of war, and hires a geological team to provide scientific evidence should it come to trial.

Jan then does a couple things that leads to his downfall.  One, he gets personally involved.  In a news broadcast, he holds up snaps of the Woburn kids who have died.  He shows empathy, which is a grave disservice to the legal profession because it clouds his judgment.  He says it's like a doctor recoiling at the sight of blood.

Fasher, the attorney for Beatrice, is a statesman-like man of experience, but has a detached air coupled with some eccentricities.  Yet he is a clever man, and his observation on the justice system is true, at times sickening.  When Schlichtmann tells him he's searching for the truth, he tells him, ""You've been around long enough to know that a courtroom's not the place to look for the truth.""  And he accurately says that the case stopped being about children the moment Schlichtmann filed for action.

The movie is sprinkled with legal commentary from Schlichtmann, which lays out how callous, ugly, and illogical the justice system is.  He begins by talking about which types of clients are worth more, i.e. are winning cases.  Whites are worth more than blacks, men more than women, a long agonizing death over a quick one.  A white male professional in his 40's, in his prime, is worth the most.  A dead child is worth least of all.  Well, Schlichtmann finds out that children are worth something after all, especially when he imagines an agonizing scene where the LaFierros were taking their son to the hospital and died en route.

While John Travolta's best known for Grease and Saturday Night Fever, A Civil Action proves he can handle serious drama and he turns in one of his best ever performances.  However, the real Jan Schlichtmann came to Farmington.  He's close to seven feet tall, and in terms of resemblance, could've been played by Richard Gere.  As Anne Anderson, Kathleen Quinlan is the other great performer, playing a woman changed through her ordeal into someone who has a tired and sad visage.  The scene where Al Love (James Gandolfini), a conscience-stricken tannery employer personally apologizes to her shows that maybe the only real meaningful apologies come from humans, not corporations.

Trials and lawsuits are examples of how corrupt and rotten the legal system and some lawyers are.

1029007,5,630542828X,"Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta)  is a Boston tort lawyer and something of an ambulance chaser who is initially reluctant to take on an industrial pollution case involving some children dead of leukaemia in rural New England. He changes his mind when he realizes the likely defendants are a couple of big companies with particularly deep pockets and smells the possibility of serious money. Over time, however his interest in the case becomes a moral obsession. The cynical becomes a crusader, refusing offers to settle as his company's finances spiral downwards towards bankruptcy.
If you like courtroom dramas, this is highly recommended. It's one of the best specimens of the genre to come out of America since `The Verdict'. It's interesting to compare it to `Erin Brockovich' released a couple of years later. EB is about how a heroic small timer takes on the big boys of corporate America and how her pluck and determination triumphs over all obstacles, something of a legal feelgood movie in other words. Which this, to its great credit, is not. Its central character, for starters, is far more amibivalently likeable: initially just out for a fast buck, moral seriousness has to creep up on him and take him by surprise (perhaps reminding writer/director Zaillian of Oskar Schindler whose story he scripted for Spielberg a few years earlier) and the story's development paints a significantly more ambivalent picture of what pluck and determination can accomplish.

It is the true story of how a materialistic personal injury lawyer pursues a noble yet unwieldly case, at the cost of all the materialistic benefits that he had spent his entire career in creating for himself.
Yes, this case really did exist.  Yes, there really was (and still is) a lawyer named Jan Schlichtmann (as portrayed by Travolta), who really did pursue this case against two large corporations, Beatrice and W.R. Grace (both named in the movie), who really did illegally dump pollutants in a neighborhood somewhere in Massachusetts, and which really did cause the deaths of 12 children from leukemia.  Yes, Mr. Schlichtmann really DID comment cynically when he was first presented with the case, ""I really don't see the value in a bunch of dead babies.""  There really was a corporate defense attorney named Jerome Facher (as portrayed by Duvall) who played this case as if constantly hedging his bets at a Vegas casino poker table.  And so on...you get the idea.
This film is brutally honest, names names, pulls no punches...and forgoes the typical, traditional Hollywood-style happy ending for one that is completely real, unfabricated, and ultimately satisfying in the realization that, it too, is real.  That doesn't mean that it is emotionally unsatisfying.  After all, after investing nearly two hours with this case, and these characters, about which we grow to care completely (especially because we know they're real), this film does provide the payoff in the end.  I just won't tell you which one; you have to see this brilliant film in order to find out.

1029050,4,630542828X,"If like me, you're something of a sucker for socially conscious movies, flicks with their hearts in the right place, then A CIVIL ACTION is definitely a must-see for you.  In terms of facing complex moral and legal issues (not always the same thing, in fact often miles apart), writer director Steven Zaillian seldom takes the easy way out.  The film rings true on those fronts--although he does frequenly engage in a kind of cinematic shorthand that compresses time and events and I do believe there are some of those ""composite characters"" so ubiquitous in true-life films.
Still it's commendable effort.  If you like courtroom drama at all, you will appreciate the wheeling and dealing and the high stakes human drama going down here.  The cast list suggests that there will be some quirky characterization going on, if not a downright acting feast.  Any movie that boasts Robert Duvall, James Gandolfini, William H. Macy and John Lithgow can't go wrong on the acting front, right?  Well, yes and no, they all turn in fine performances.  Only Macy and Duvall get to do anything really quirky though.
Others have suggested that John Travolta is somewhat miscast here.  I disagree.  He makes a believable transition from money grubbing ambulance chaser to impassioned champion of the common man (woman and CHILD).  Not easy to do in the space of a couple of hours.  Jonathan Harr had over 500 pages to tell that tale.  Harr tells it better, but Travolta and Zaillian do a credible job, given the limitations of cinema.
A CIVIL ACTION is a worthy effort.  Certainly not perfect, but many will find it provocative.  Most will find it well worth their time.

I have to say up front that I have not, as yet, read the book, so I have no idea how faithful the screen adaptation is to the characters or events portrayed. Nor do I have any legal training, so I cannot argue procedural points and inaccuracies etc, so I will be reviewing the film for what it is, a film I enjoyed enormously in the cinema when it was first released, then bought on DVD.
For me, ""A Civil Action"" is about the sins, and ultimate redemption, of an amoral, sleaze-bag, ambulance chasing, personal injury lawyer named Jan Schlichtmann, played to perfection by John Travolta. His sins are many, but chief amongst them are, greed - DUH, he's a LAWYER! - avarice, and the one that brings about his ultimate downfall, pride.
We are introduced to the way Mr Schlichtmann operates in a blackly funny prologue. This shows said sleaze-bag lawyer pushing one of his wheelchair bound clients into court, arranging his pillows, getting him a drink, wiping away the resultant drips and drools. All the while jury members desperately try to choke back their tears, and the defending lawyers in the medical malpractice case equally desperately try to settle before the trial proper begins by writing increasingly large numbers on a pad for Schlichtmann to approve. While this is all going on Mr Schlichtmann gives a wonderfully deadpan voiceover, explaining how much you can expect to receive for various types of injury; loss of limb, blindness, death etc. Next we see our hero striding purposefully down the street, passing a traffic accident, handing his card to both parties, and moving on without hardly breaking step!
But the film is not a one-man-show. It has an excellent core cast comprising Tony Shalhoub and William H Macey as Schlichtmann's partners, Kathleen Quinlan and a pre ""Sopranos"" James Gandolfini as grieving parents. Dan Hedaya as the owner of the plant at the center of the story, John Lithgow as the trial judge, and last, but definitely NOT least, Robert Duval, the main defending lawyer, and Schlichtmann's nemesis, Jerome Facher.
After the opening prologue, we see that Schlichtmann's practice has inherited the ""poisoning"" case, but can do nothing with it because they can't find anyone to sue! Schlichtmann decides that he will personally visit the defendants and tell them that - sorry! - there's nothing to be done. While there he discovers that there is indeed someone to sue, the land and plant are owned by two of America's major corporations... these people, and his practice, are sitting on, as he describes it, ""a gold mine!"" The case continues, overwhelming evidence is gathered, Schlichtmann and his team talk about hundreds of millions of $'s in compensation for the aggrieved families of Woburn, Massachusetts... with a healthy percentage going to the practice itself of course! Unfortunately Schlichtmann's fatal weakness is his pride; the defendants are willing to settle out of court, but Schlichtmann is determined to take the case to trial and get the families, not only their money, but also an apology from all those concerned.
There is a beautiful scene where Facher and Schlichtmann are out in a corridor awaiting a jury's decision. Facher asks Schlichtmann what he hopes will happen, Schlichtmann replies that he hopes the jury will see the ""truth,"" after sitting through the endless procedural BS'ing and maneuvering that has made up the case. Facher is aghast, and tells Schlichtmann that he should know that, ""...a courtroom isn't a place to look for the truth."" This certainly supports my own rather cynical view that there is ""Justice,"" and there is the ""Law."" Unfortunately, they are rarely one and the same.
The blurb on the jacket claims that ""A Civil Action"" is, ""The best legal thriller ever."" I personally believe this quote does the film a major disservice; by calling it a ""thriller"" it gives the audience the idea that this is going to be something formulaic and Hollywood, with the requisite ""Hollywood"" ending, it's not. It's based on true events and shows the legal system here in the USA stripped bare, it shows the impartial brutality of the adversarial system, and how one mans flaws can be amplified by that system, `til they consume not only him, but all those around him.
I think this is an excellent film, as are the performances of all concerned. But be warned, this is NOT a ""feel good"" movie, unlike ""Erin Brockovich,"" with which it shares many surface similarities, and it is this that probably explains why it pretty much bombed here in the US, but was a big hit in the UK. There is a bitter-sweet ending, given to us in a coda which shows the ultimate price Mr Schlichtmann paid for his involvement in the case, and what he is doing now. And yes, for those of us out there who ever doubted it, ""A Civil Action,"" the film credited with re-launching ol' swivel hips' career, proves, once and for all, that John Travolta CAN act!",1041033600,4,5164,4.8560090702947845

 Water. It's a basic fact we need it to survive. The human body can go longer without food than it can water. But what do you do when the water you need to survive may be killing your children? A small town in the North Eastern part of the United States faced this very problem in the 1970s.
 John Travolta plays Lawyer Jan Schlictmann in this movie based off a true story. Jan is the hottest young lawyer in Boston. He is a personal claims lawyer (some would call him an ambulance chaser of the highest degree) with a thriving small practice. He is one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Boston. Jan will do anything to win a case. He has his own personal equation as to which person will bring in the most money from a trial and thus fill his pockets the deepest. The client he desperately wants to avoid is a dead child as they are worth the least in a jury verdict.
 Everything is going well for Jan and then a case with at least 10 dead children drops into his lap. This case is known as an ""orphan"" as it has landed in every prominent lawyer's office and all have passed on it prior to him. Jan meets with the families to give them a personal ""No thank you."" While there he finds of their suspicions as to chemicals that have been dumped into the ground and poisoned the water supply. What interests Jan the most is the parent companies behind the dumping. Suddenly a no interest case becomes one which could net him millions.
 The rest of the movie deals with Jan's obsessive involvement with this case. How it raises him to an almost unheard of prominence and dumps him into the lowest levels he has ever been.
 John Travolta does a good job in this role. He can play the ultimate of arrogance and also the most wounded of individuals as he grows to learn more about what life is truly about. William H. Macy is Jan's financial affairs person who is desperately trying to keep the firm afloat as Jan's obsession causes them to spend more and more. John Lithgow is fine as the Judge. Robert Duvall is great as the opposing lawyer who gives Jan a lesson in legal theatrics.
 The movie is well done but a little slow at times. Definitely would recommend it as the performances by all move this one.",1013904000,,2221,4.314148681055156

Its too drawn out, the acting is ok, but that was thanks to John Travolta (who wasn't all that good himself), and well William H Macy isn't any good. James Gandolfini is ok, but hes only in 15 minutes, (and thats pushing it).
The film is about this law firm, who is headed by John Travolta (Pulp Fiction, Grease). His firm is rich, and only worry about themselves, until he finds this woman who is needing help. Supposedly her son, along with seven other children have died from leukemia. They suspect its the drinking water. As John Travolta struggles to find out what happened, even if it means he will loose his reputation, career, and his home.
This film has a really good cast with John Travolta, Robert Duvall (The Godfather, The Godfather Part II), William H Macy (Magnolia, Air Force One), and James Gandolfini (The Sopranos, Get Shorty). But that don't always make for a good movie. This film is just not my cup of tea. If you want to see something of this nature check out The Insider (Russell Crowe, Al Pacino) or Erin Brokovich (Julia Roberts).

The film's denouement is brilliantly filmed and edited and leaves the viewer left to discover the better part of human nature.  This is a perfect example of post-romantic Hollywood film-making where visuals are not on the screen but are left to the mind's eye and in this case the film's directorial style finally delivers a totally satisfying piece of story telling.

Steven Zaillian is a totally underrated director. He directed two other great films SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and ALL THE KING'S MEN.

It stars Schlichtmann (John Travolta) as a lawyer who takes on the case about the numerous deaths reported in the New England area. There deaths have something to do with the towns water. Two parents in particular (Kathleen Quinlan and James Gandolfini) just want a simple ""were sorry"" from the company that is responsible for the  toxic waste in the water supply.

1029079,3,630542828X,"John Travolta is Jan Schlichtman, who heads a small but hugely profitable New England law firm powered by a small circle of legal sharks. His team includes Tony Shalhoub and Bill Macy and an endless reservoir of legal agression. Their can-do attitude has rewarded the firm's partners handsomely, and Travolta's charachter expands his tastes fit what they can buy. (He can afford both a Porsche and a seemingly endless stream of speeding tickets). Unknowingly at first, the firm takes as a client the emotionally bereft inhabitants of a rural town suffering a cluster of cancers and leukemia. After a single visit, Jan Schlictman discovers a possible link between the disease, possibly contaminated water and a nearby tannery that provides products for ""Beatrice"" a multinational consortium that makes....everything. Plunging into the case with the idea of securing a monster settlement from the huge consportium, Schlichtman confronts an overpowering sadness unlike anything he's ever encountered, and one he allows to get the better of him. Soon, hoped-for settlement proposals are turned down, ideals substitute for dollar signs, and the firm racks up horrific bills in its bid to link the Beatrice tannery to the rash of lukemia and death surrounding a small town - there must be a fight.
Unfortunately - that's where it bogs down, the fight never comes. Instead, we get to see Travolta become unhinged as his sage (but not quite saintly)legal nemesis (Robert Duval) frames a comment on legal dedication, with Schlichtman as the obvious example. Schlicthman's life had by then devolved into a process for making money and finding things to spend it on. With the profit motive gone, his mind follows. In amove that Schlichtman rails against (but which we never explore fully enough for it to register) the Judge allows the jury to sever Beatrice from the trail, and Schlichtman's duel with Duvall's charachter never reaches the Hollywood stage of ""You Can't Handle The Truth!""  In the end, Schlictman's fortunes are destroyed, his career and his firm in ruins, and the hard-bargained-for settlement only leaves his clients embittered.  No amount of settlement can remotely substitute for what the town's residents have lost, and nothing can mitigate the failure that Schlictman's efforts have produced.  In a voice-over, played out as documents and transcripts from the trial are dusted off and trucked out into the light of day (down the beltway where we're supposed to think that they'll be reviewed anew) Schlichtman both confesses failure yet exhorts us to follow his example.  Failure, he seems to say, is hardly a reason to shy from the epic effort of battling evil in its many banal forms.  Still, while the tragic ends of the film swerve away from Hollywood's ""the little guy wins"" mentality, it doesn't really leave anything in its wake.  By the end of the film, Schlichtman has matured beyond measuring himself by his material profits, but nothing quite fills the gap left by the legal shark who got things rolling at the film's opening.",991785600,,3049,5.112449799196787

Pros:
* Of course, this is one of those John Travolta-gets-20-mil movies, so it must be good, right? Well, maybe. John certainly gave a terrific performance in the movie.
* The movie is virtually star-studded. It includes such great actors as Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, and most importantly, John Lithgow. I love this guy. After seeing him do an awesome job on 3rd Rock from the Sun, it's nice to see him do something very serious again. He is amazingly convincing as the judge in the movie, and when he angrily screams, acting doesn't get any better. The movie also contains two of my all time favorite supporting actors, Dan Hedaya (Dick, First Wives Club) and James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano).
* One of the most exciting things in movies is the trial scenes (just watch A Few Good Men and Primal Fear). The trial scenes in this movie are pretty good.
Cons:
* At the end, what happened? Instead of writing what happened to the characters we hated, we should've seen it. That ruined the ending.

1029081,3,630542828X,"A Civil action is a solid movie with some good performances and a story that does not cave into Hollywood's propensity for clichs.
I was not expecting a whole lot from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised. It offers an intriguing story based on real events surrounding the contamination of the water supply in the small, industrial Boston suburb. However, it seems to be at least as much if not more so about the legal process than about the suit itself. Travolta, who plays the prosecuting attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, before the trial was a successful was a not very respected personal injury lawyer (A.K.A. ambulance chaser). During the progression of the story, he narrates advice to the audience as if a he is a law professor. It is this instruction that he himself does not follow and thus leads to trouble for himself and his clients. The movie, in this way, is almost as much about the seemingly illogical logic behind litigation then it is about the individual case it portrays.
Travolta does an excellent job as the attorney who feels he constantly has something to prove to the corporate monstrosities of Beatrice and Grace and their Harvard-educated attorneys (Schlichtmann, it turns out, graduated from lowly Northwestern). Robert Duvall plays Jerome Facher, Beatrice's lawyer, as an old wise man who has seen everything and is impossible to ruffle. All he wants is to be left alone to eat his lunch in peace and he is content. William H. Macy plays Schlichtmann's firm's increasingly depressed accountant who is forced to leverage the partner's mortgages and take pile charges onto 20 credit cards in the seemingly hopeless effort to wait out the juggernauts their firm is up against.
The DVD is itself very mediocre. It has a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, but because this isn't an action film, but more of a human/courtroom drama, there's really not a whole lot here to take advantage of 5.1 channels. The only ""special feature"" of this DVD is the so-called ""Production Featurette"" which must be all of 5 minutes long and amounts to more of a glorified trailer than anything else - basically it's just a rehash of scenes from the movie with a couple of really quick takes from Travolta and Macy about the movie.

The case is worthy, the victims deserving of justice, and the battle collossal. John Travolta as the top obsessed lawyer is excellent, and Robert Duvall as a wise, old opponent is superb.  A magnificient cast rounds out this drama concerning the illness of adults, deaths of innocent children, and animals because of contaminated drinking water and industrial pollution.  Unfolding the massive cover-up and getting this case into the courtroom to be heard is almost impossible, but our hero plods on.  Gripping, intense, yet uplifting and redeeming in its concept of the often frustrating saga  of "" trying to do the right thing.""  I liked the film.

1029083,4,630542828X,"After recently reading Jonathan Harr's book A Civil Action, I eagerly awaited seeing the movie version of this sad and absorbing story. The film version condenses the story and leaves out several interesting portions of  the book, but is fine nevertheless. John Travolta is a perfect choice to  play Jan Schlichtmann, the egotistical, free-spending attorney who dives  headfirst into a damages case against the corporate giants Beatrice and  W.R. Grace, who are accused of poisoning the drinking water of Woburn,  Massachusetts and causing a leukemia outbreak. William H. Macy, Tony  Shalhoub, and Zeljko Ivanek co-star as Schlichtmann's partners in the firm,  and one only wishes that they would have protested his actions, which led  to the financial ruin of him and his firm.
Robert Duvall gives another  terrific performance as Jerome Facher, Beatrice's attorney, who is the  complete opposite of Schlichtmann. In a scene at a fancy hotel conference  room, the frugal Facher is not impressed by any of the lawyers or their  arguments, but the free pen that he can take home. It's a subtly funny  scene that illustrates Facher perfectly. John Lithgow does a terrific job  as Judge Walter Skinner, who Schlichtmann believes is siding with the  enemy.
A Civil Action is a story where the winners and losers are  unclear, and it must have been difficult for writer-director Steven  Zaillian to condense Harr's technical-laden novel. The result is a solid  drama with powerhouse acting. Highly recommended.",963792000,2,1505,5.2259414225941425

The opening scene will plant you firmly in your chair as  Jan Schlichtmann (played by John Travolta) explains the financial calculus  behind accepting and declining potential clients with personal injury  claims.  Jerome Facher (played by Robert Duvall) is infuriating with his  unending legal maneuverings designed to extract his corporate client from  an untenable legal position permeated with liability.  The traitorous  conduct of Schlichtmann's partners will make you wretch with disgust as  they scramble to save themselves at the expense of righting a terrible  wrong evidenced by a dozen dead children.  Engrossing, to say the  least.
Yes, the movie isn't perfect.  Travolta's portrayal of Jan  Schlichtmann doesn't completely mesh with the character in the book, there  isn't a practicing attorney alive who doesn't know Rule 11 (court-imposed  sanctions for unethical conduct), and the legal proceedings aren't quite  right.  Who cares?  If the director had included the day-to-day minutiae  involved in getting a case to trial, the film would have been three years  long!  My fellow reviewers are unreasonable in their unrelenting  critiques.
If you're involved in the legal profession, this film will  make you step back and reassess your brand of client representation.  Are  you taking the right cases?

This one follows several small and large companies (Beatrice Foods  is named specifically) who (basically) poison a community through several  legal and moral violations of environmental law.

1029086,3,630542828X,"This is a fine movie, just inaccurate. When I saw the movie I knew precious little about the events surrounding the Woburn case. Since the movie I've grown quite familiar with the case- for a class at the law  school I attend I was required to read the book and read a companion to the  book containing copies of the actual documents the two sides entered into  evidence. The movie, I came to realize, was a fine piece of cinema but  grossly inaccurate as to what actually happened in the book.
Travolta is  fine as Jan Schlictman, the lawyer pursuing the case against the W.R. Grace  and Beatrice Foods Corporations for dumping TCE into the river around the  city of Woburn. Critics of the book who disliked the slight slant author  Jonathan Harr gave to Schlictman and the plaintiffs will really dislike the  larger slant the film gives in their favor. The real Jan Schlictman is  hardly the callous jerk the movie makes him out to be in the beginning.  Likewise the movie also makes caricatures out of Schlictman's foes- Grace  lawyer William Cheeseman (who is unfairly portrayed as a doofus) and  Beatrice lawyer Jerome Facher (who comes across as a scheming,  Machiavellian presence). Critics also quarrel with the film's portrayal of  Judge Walter J. Skinner, who is made out to be a tyrannical presence in the  courtroom.
In terms of acting I rather liked Robert Duvall's turn as  Facher. He gives a lot of depth to Facher, where a lesser actor would have  made Facher a cartoonish villain. It is important to understand that  Facher, Schlictman, and Cheeseman were not evil people- they were just  advocates for their clients doing their best. The movie also leaves out a  lot of important details and misportrays a lot of events. (The portrayal of  the Rule 11 hearing, for example, is utterly wrong.) Those not familiar  with the book will find Harr's analysis of the pretrial maneuvering to be  facinating, but totally gone from the movie.
Don't misunderstand me- the  movie is very good, on the balance. It gets some things right about the law  (one of my biggest pet peeves is hearing people take legal facts they hear  from movies and believe they are actually real), and the performances are  (mostly) quite good.
