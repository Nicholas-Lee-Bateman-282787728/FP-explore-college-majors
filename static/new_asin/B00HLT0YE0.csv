8633323,5,B00HLT0YE0,"It was unusual to have the resources available to film live circus acts at the time that this video was made, consequently, the footage of circus performances is valuable as an historic record.  Unfortunately, the stilted narration by Don Ameche adds nothing to the narrative and could have been eliminated.  Recommended for circus, popular culture and theater historians.",1400457600,,372,5.396551724137931
8633324,3,B00HLT0YE0,"This is a classic film for anyone interested in circus arts: The acts in this documentary are for the most part some of the greatest European circus acts of the 1960s. It even includes a young, still-German Gunther Gebel-Williams before he became an American circus icon.

However, the commentary narrated by Don Ameche--playing the part of a former circus producer or agent who, amazingly, doesn't understand anything about circus arts--is extraordinarily idiotic: it is based on the most ignorant clichs ever propagated about circus artists and their craft, as if their only interest in performing was to risk their lives... (which in many instances in this film is even totally irrelevant).

There are also added canned sound effects, such as tigers' roar and elephant's trumpeting, to create an impression of danger and wilderness that didn't exist, and even canned laughs accompanying famous European clowns who certainly didn't need this editorial ""help"". This is the sort of American documentary where the producers impose their views and crass ignorance instead of just watching and learning.

Nonetheless, without sound, it is still a great circus documentary, and also and important testimony about the circus of that era.",1399161600,,1232,5.34020618556701
8633325,5,B00HLT0YE0,"This DVD has just been released and I never knew about this movie eventhough I am a big circus fan and have many circus DVD's and videos. There are wonderful acts in it, some I knew and others I did not know. The camera work is excellent, as is the richness of the color, and Don Ameche is a very good narrator being a big circus fan and knows many of these performers. An excellent discovery and great addition of Circus film to my collection.",1393891200,,444,4.235294117647059
