8525352,3,B001KVHHFY,I thought this would be something a little different to the run of the mill dressage training DVD....It is not. Informs you about training of a horse and releasing the pressure/aid to reward/motivate the horse. Give the horse a rest to reward/motivate him. I am not saying this is a bad DVD as it is not. Beautiful horses and classical principles BUT if I knew what it contained before I bought it i would have purchased something else as I already have a number of DVDs and books on training a dressage horse. In fact the title of this DVD should be training the dressage horse...much more accurate. I'm disappointed.,1352332800,,618,4.627272727272727
