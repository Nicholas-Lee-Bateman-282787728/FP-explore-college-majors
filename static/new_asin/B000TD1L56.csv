8208630,5,B000TD1L56,"Charlie Rose does these memorial shows especially well. Here he has a great subject, Beverly Sills. Both as artist and as personality she stands out. He shows clips of her operatic performances, and of his interviews with her over the years. She speaks not only about her singing and career in this but about her career as head of Lincoln Center. She has always been a person filled with life and optimism, extremely pleasant to see and hear.
In the final segment Rose speaks beautifully of his friendship with her, and the way she related so encouragingly to all who knew her. The last musical excerpt is a particularly effective one.
The thought I had at the end of the show is how blessed humanity is by having certain ' great people'. These are the people of some extrarodinary talent or ability whose performances bring us to another level of feeling entirely. Sills was such a person.
Her description of her one supreme performance the one in which she did everything right, the one she could never repeat - is instructive and inspiring. Especially memorable at least to me was her description of the kind of confidence and certainty she had before a performance. She knew she had what to give- and she gave it.",1196294400,22,1217,4.665116279069768
