8270287,4,B0018O3P4A,"Fascinating PBS Nova program that addresses the question:  what happened to several hundred Spaniards unaccounted for during the Spanish Invasion.  Answer:  they were eaten.

New archaeology at Zultepec--generally well done but not quite enough story for 55-minute program.",1455926400,,273,6.105263157894737

8270289,2,B0018O3P4A,"First off let me just say that they need to pay their people more - that poor archeologist had to go to Mexico, to several different locations over time, and only had one outfit to wear for the entire time! Don't let your kids grow up to be archeologists!
Also there's that ever-present drone-on about things they already told you ten minutes ago. Also they obviously handed her something and said read this to the camera.
There's a LOT of bad info in this, a lot of confusion, obfuscation and general averageness to this show. While I did learn a little, I also heard things that I kn ow were not what I was taught or have studied. Some of these secrets could have simply been kept to the producers closet. Not the best show of the series.",1404172800,,740,4.369565217391305
8270290,5,B0018O3P4A,"gives details and history that is usually left out of text books, if you are interested in the topic this is the best video i have seen so far on the war between the aztecs and the spanish",1289260800,,188,3.973684210526316
8270291,1,B0018O3P4A,"This video is amazingly bad, especially for a PBS movie.  They must have contracted out for this one because there are SO MANY inaccuracies and outright falsehoods in it.  I thought it was perhaps just me who was having a coronary as I watched it but after I watched it I went online and saw that I wasn't alone.  On PBS's website there were many comments on the movie, many having spotted the same inaccuracies as I had.  Really a shame, given PBS's good reputation as a knowledgeable source of information.",1275955200,4,508,4.549450549450549
8270292,3,B0018O3P4A,"The documentary states twice that victors write history.  Too often, it's assumed that the Aztec empire easily crumbled without much action from the Spanish.  However, an ancient grave site suggests that some Spaniards, male and female, were sacrificed by some indigenous peoples.

I don't care for history shows with cheesy reenactments (ka-choo! History Channel).  However, this PBS work had computer-generated images suggesting what the past may have looked like.  Even with the actors, it was great to see people wearing gigantic feathers and sporting face makeup.

The idea that race doesn't exist biologically is often stated.  However, here, these forensic experts could just look at a skull and determine the deceased's race and gender.  Many documentaries on the Aztecs say that indigenous people from conquered tribes worked with the Spanish to defeat the Aztecs.  So, indigenous versus indigenous is a given, but here they say the casualties were people trying to arrest Cortez, so this proved that there were Spanish versus Spanish schisms as well.  I was surprised to hear that Spanish women travelled to the ""New World"" as I had learned that English colonialists made sure to bring women with them because they saw how the lack of Spanish women led to miscegenation in Latin America (I don't have a problem with miscegenation, but early colonialists would have, that's why I'm bringing it up).

Many of the sacrifice reenactments happened at night.  As a viewer, this made it difficult to see.  In the few codices that I've seen, ceremonies didn't take place at night.  The narrator says nothing about it.  So I am confused about whether this group was actually sacrificed at night or if that was a way to make the scene look scarier for modern viewers.

One interviewee had an awesome, well-defined chin dimple.  The interviewees were diverse, including Latino and Caucasian speakers, as well as men and women.  Foucaultians may love this work as it shows how even the oppressed have some power.  There is a flaw here:  the narrator states, ""It has been suspected that the Aztecs ate sacrificial victims"" and then they show a codice where Aztecs are clearly chomping on some human body parts.  There's nothing to suspect!  The proof is right there!",1213315200,,2263,5.059459459459459
