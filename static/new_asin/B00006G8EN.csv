8246262,5,B00006G8EN,"Cool ""behind the scenes"" view into the life of a professional skateboarder (and BMX rider) on tour.
Lots of travel, interviews with the pro's, activities and of course riding at the top professional level.
Worth the watch!",1390262400,,222,5.027027027027027

8246264,3,B00006G8EN,"Well if you're trying to choose between the 2001 and the 2000 tour, get the 2001 tour. After watching the 2001 tour, this DVD was a little dissapointing. The lineup of skaters is just as good, but they just don't do as much. The only people who get much air time are Tony Hawk and Jason Ellis and the bikers. Which would be cool, but when you've got people like Andrew Reynolds and Brian Sumner listed on the video, but they have about 3 minutes combined air time on a 6 hour DVD its kinda sad. And the complete lack of Mike Vallely and the very sparse footage of Bam Margera means everything is pretty much tech, rather than burly, and the tech isn't that impressive.
Having said that, the skating isn't too bad. They got stuck with a bunch of rather undesirable parks to skate, so there's nothing that's especially progressive on here. And the extra cirricular activities aren't that much fun to watch either. If you're a fan of the series, its kinda cool to have, and I'm glad I bought it, but it really isn't that great of a skateboarding video. Get the 2001 tour.",1032480000,4,1068,4.398989898989899
