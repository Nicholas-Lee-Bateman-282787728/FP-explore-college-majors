2818623,5,B000PGTPC8,"As a huge fan of the original show, I was ecstatic when the first season appeared and watched each episode at least two or three times.  They just don't age - which is a tribute to the production standards of the show and the passion of Jack Lord for what was his master work.

However, having Series Two in my hands tonight, I am scandalized to see no episode appearing between ""Blind Tiger"" and ""Run, Johnny, Run"".  What is missing is the ""banned"" episode ""Bored, She Hung Herself"".  This episode was more than a little controversial, dealing with practitioners of ""near hanging"" experimentation - and was one that never saw much syndication for the supposed ideas it would put into peoples' heads.

To my mind, the whole idea of a DVD collection that you pay good money for is to possess the full and unabridged series as it originally aired.  In its ""wisdom"", Paramount / Viacom decided against that with this set - and I for one am very very upset.

I give this set five stars for what it represents and the quality of the series that everyone should experience - but not for the cowardice of the ""suits"" who are selling an incomplete product.",1185840000,13,1148,4.543689320388349
2818624,2,B000PGTPC8,"How can a company that took so much time to bring Five-O fans a great Season One box set go horribly wrong with Season Two? First they don't include episode 16 ""Bored, She Hung Herself"". I've seen this episode. It was controversial at the time, and not one of the best produced, but it should be here. Then to put edited versions of some of the episodes (and not even list which ones they are), very sad. Why couldn't Paramont be consistant and give each seasons release the same great treatment fans want and expect? Sad indeed.",1185840000,8,529,4.463917525773196
2818625,3,B000PGTPC8,"Hawaii Five-O had a great run on TV and Jack Lord and Charles MacArthur, (Helen Hayes son) made a great team as McGarrett and Danno, however WHY, let me repeat WHY is the second season not complete. A small print disclamer on the rear bottom back of the box says the ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" episode is not included and only aired once. Yes it does not say complete second season episodes on the box. Its a 5star box set, but only 3stars for the missing episode",1185840000,12,462,4.32183908045977
2818626,1,B000PGTPC8,"The second season may not be complete as 1 episode may not be included ( Bored, She Hung Herself ) and other episodes may be edited from their originally aired versions",1185148800,13,168,4.451612903225806
2818627,5,B000PGTPC8,"There are so many good things about this show.....beautiful scenery, a link to the past, a view of the way Hawaii looked before becoming overdeveloped, and also good acting.  It was ""real"" for the time without being too extreme (like all the cop shows now)and one can still get a sense of ""culture"" of the time.  What CAN one say about McGarrett???  He is totally awesome!!!",1183939200,5,374,4.636363636363637
2818628,5,B000PGTPC8,"Hawaii Five-O was not your ordinary police drama. Besides the lush location of Hawaii and the unforgettably terrific theme music, the stylized characters and story lines really added a fantastic element to the show, an element missing from more mundane or ""realistic"" police dramas of both then and now. When you turned this show on from week to week you never knew what kind of story you were going to see. It might be a story about thieves, mobsters or murderers, but it might just as likely be about something larger or more fantastic like international spies, assassination conspiracies or the threat of biological epidemics. Even the stories dealing with common crimes were heavily stylized, often pitting the Five-O team against near super-villain type enemies. In a way, this show mixed the best of police dramas with some of the best elements of stylized spy thrillers, classic detective fiction, and even a tinge of comic book superheroes. It's as if someone took all the best elements of Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, Mission Impossible and Batman and somehow came out with a surreal blend of police melodrama and heroic fiction that is fascinating and fun to watch.

Here is an episode list for Season Two:

Thousand Pardons -- You're Dead!

Kiss the Queen Goodbye

The incorruptible and larger-than-life characters of Steve McGarrett and his stalwart crew of Danny, Kono and Chin Ho made for an interesting mix. At the time this show first appeared on television, only Star Trek had as ethnically diverse and interesting a cast as this show and they were the only two shows to completely eschew ethnic stereotypes in how they used their diverse cast. The show took full advantage of the diversity and beauty of both the Hawaiian Islands as well as the local population when filming, rather than hiding it. This may have been a gamble in 1968, but it's one that happily paid off and helped pave the way for a more realistic view of our country's population on TV in years to come. Hawaii Five-O was a huge ratings success and ran for 12 seasons, forever in the world of TV. And it deserved it. Then and now, these shows are fun to watch. I already own Hawaii Five-O Season One on DVD and am enjoying it thoroughly, as is my young son who is seeing the show for the first time. I am looking forward to owning Season Two on DVD shortly and hopefully more sets after that. ""Be there, aloha!""",1179100800,79,5567,4.78803777544596
2818629,5,B000PGTPC8,"one of the all time great tv shows.  please, please keep the releases coming!!",1178841600,3,78,4.571428571428571
2818630,5,B000PGTPC8,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors. Hawaii Five-O had a lot going for it then, and it has a lot going for it now.",1178236800,59,1802,4.569659442724459
2818631,5,B000PGTPC8,"To the previous reviewer -- yes, the ""'V' for Vashon"" trilogy is definitely Five-0 at its best, but that was season 5, not 7! Season 8 gave us ""The Case Against McGarrett"" where Harold Gould reprises his role as Honore Vashon who puts McGarrett on trial in prison for the murder of his son Chris back in Season 5! Seasons 1-9 were Five-0 at its best, after that the show began to slip...

I'd have to say that Season 5 is my favorite, but my all-time favorite episode was from Season 4 -- ""Rest in Peace, Somebody"" where McGarrett is being harassed by someone from his past holding a deadly grudge against him and who is planning to assassinate the governor to ruin McGarrett!

As for Season 2 -- great season as well, just like Season 1! Standout episodes include ""A Thousand Pardons -- You're Dead!"", ""A Bullet for McGarrett"", ""The Singapore File"", ""Blind Tiger"" (with Marion ""Happy Days"" Ross), ""Killer Bee"", ""Cry, Lie"" (with Martin Sheen), ""Nightmare Road""

Hope Season 3 is on its way! That one has the unforgettable comedy classic ""Over Fifty? Steal"" with Hume Cronyn as wily master-of-disguise crook Lewis Avery Filer!",1178064000,11,1125,4.729591836734694

2818635,4,B000PGTPC8,"The original Hawaii Five-O got better in the second season. The twenty-four episodes is on six DVDs. This was perhaps the first television series shot entirely on location in America's fiftieth state of Hawaii. Unlike the first season, there are now special features besides the episodes except the episode promo commercials.

The six DVD set includes guest appearances include many favorite and familiar faces like Ed Flanders (St. Elsewhere) in the two part episode ""Three Dead Cows at Makapuu"" along with Loretta Swit (MASH) and Dana Elcar (original Macgyver). She also appeared in the first season and earlier in the season. Tom Skerrit played a bereaved Honolulu cop in the episode ""Most Likely to Murder."" Joanne Linville and George Gaynes appeared in the final episode. Martin Sheen has a memorable appearance in the episode ""Cry, Lie."" Marj Dusay (Facts of Life and Guiding Light) had a memorable appearance in the episode, ""The Signapore File."" Christopher Walken acts in the episode ""Run, Johnny, Run."" My favorite performance of the season was Beverlee McKinsey in the episode, ""The Joker's Wild, Man, Wild!"" as a Texas heiress. Jack Lord's Steve MacGarrett referred to her as ""Angel Face"" but she was anything but in this episode. She was the reason that I bought this DVD for her performance in one episode. Beverlee McKinsey was an amazing actress on daytime. Too bad, the primetime and film industry didn't gobble her up when they had the chance.

The camaraderie of cast members led by Jack Lord as Steve McGarrett is unforgettable. The largely male cast worked as a team to solve and prevent crimes in Honolulu and all over the island. They referred Hawaii as the rock. The original series was smart, well-written and acted with every episode (unique and special). If you enjoyed the first season, you will want to watch the second season of this original smart show.",1494720000,,1884,4.996815286624204

2818638,5,B000PGTPC8,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. Its second season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,787,5.735042735042735

Today's TV plots are usually too intricate not to pay full attention, not so with Hawaii Five-O (Classic).  I can watch and ""Puzzle,"" as my wife calls it and still follow the plot.  Also I enjoy the TV shows from my younger years, especially Hawaii Five-O (Classic).  It's fun to see some of the older character actors or today's veteran actors learning their craft.

Apart from Jack Lord the acting is wonderfully stiff.  The actors who played Chin and Kono might just as well been standing in front of the camera holding a script.  The extras did everything but look directly into the camera and say: 'look, we're extras.'  The horrible acting is one of the endearing qualities of the show.

The best TV show opening of all time is there plus beautiful scenery, great ensemble of characters, beautiful women in swimsuits and seeing cars from the 60's when they were new.  Lots to entertain.  Just a couple of small criticisms though.  McGarrett frequently leaves headquarters in a two door car and comes screeching up to the crime scene in a four door car.  Also they sometimes use a caucasian to play an oriental character using really bad looking prosthetics.  Maybe it didn't look as bad on TV's in the 60's but is a bit distracting on a modern TV.  Couldn't they find orientals to portray orientals?",1413417600,,653,4.675438596491228

My gripe is if they aren't going to include it,an explanation would be nice. Other than that it was a great show. And cast member Kam Fong was a retired police officer so, as far as I know he was able to advise the writers to leave out mistakes that were so common in old cop shows of the day. My other complaint (just minor) is McGarret""s nemesis Wo Fat is in 2 episodes of this season. I hate Wo Fat.

This season also still features some of that hideous false epicanthic disguise worn in order to mimic Asian features(episode 2/To Hell with Babe Ruth).

This season 2 set is mostly complete save for that one infamous missing episode. Most of the episodes also feature an episodic promo narrated by Jack Lord .. ""Be here, aloha"".

In the 60's air travel was becoming more affordable for middle class and the advertisers of the era advertised the heck out of Hawaii. Growing up in the cold frigid midwest, Hawaii became my dream ""destination of choice"".  I never dreamed it would ever be possible to visit Hawaii. Now, 30-40 years after the ""Jack Lord"" Hawaii 5-O series era and having had the opportunity to vacation several times in Hawaii, these shows bring back lots of memories and feelings.  I've been to many of the sites shown in the series and know that the series is basically accurate.  There is still a ""Hawaii 5-O feeling in Hawaii today if you look for it.  We will be ordering the next 2 seasons soon--those early 70's were the actual years my husband was in and out of Pearl Harbor during the Vietnam era.  I am very thankful these old shows are available--what a wonderful and revealing way to reveiw one's life and the development of today's society.  Magnum P I  (the 80's) basically picks up where Hawaii 5-O leaves off--we've watched those too. It would be nice to be able to get hold of the old Hawaiian Eye series that was aired before Hawaii 5-O.  Last time I checked, they weren't yet available.  With the realization that tv shows aren't always an accurate view of society, these shows are still a good tool to view society's changes through time and help me to sort out my own development.",1393027200,2,1498,4.593984962406015

2818751,4,B000PGTPC8,"Most dedicated fans of ""Hawaii Five O"" have stated over and over that prior to the release of the series' Season 2 box set that they were hopeful the episode entitled ""Bored: She Hung Herself"" would be included. As we now know that is not the case. Those who put the set together tried in vain to get the episode included but CBS' stupid legal department wouldn't allow it citing that they were worried someone would try a stunt that was depicted in the episode. In 1970 when ""Bored: She Hung Herself"" aired on CBS someone tried the so-called ""hanging technique"" that was used in the air show and a few days later someone tried it and died. That particular episode never aired as a rerun on the network, was never put into the syndication strip of ""Hawaii Five O"" and now is not included on the DVD release of the series. Come on CBS! This is a new day and time! Omitting that episode takes away the idea that DVD releases are suppose to allow consumers the ability to own ALL the shows of a series, even those that have been cited as being ""buried"". If the legal department was so worried why not add a disclaimer at the beginning of the episode. Anyhow, this is the sole reason I only gave ""Season 2"" a 4 star rating...shame on you CBS!

 Still, the 24 episodes here look beautiful, are totally remastered and only make us want to own more ""Hawaii Five O"" sets. And yes all 12 seasons are released so if you haven't started your collection do it now!.

 Like Season 1 ""Hawaii Five O-Season 2"" was still having a difficult time finding its audience despite the beautiful visuals of Hawaii as the series did not finish in the Top 30.",1359072000,,1633,4.37953795379538

2818755,5,B000PGTPC8,"I've been incrementally buying many of the old TV series that I had liked as a teenager. I didn't want to buy them all at once before confirming I'd enjoy them now as much as years ago.

I had little doubts about Hawaii Five-O of course. Season one was fine. Despite watching reruns after school for years, I didn't recall any of the episodes. So that was a nice surprise. Plus the special feature (cast reunion) is very enlightening about how the series was planned and made.

But season 2 has just floored me. Talk about great acting. Awesome guest appearances by Loretta Swit (Mash), Will Geer (the grandfather in the Waltons), and Eric Braedon (Captain Hans Dietrich - The Rat Patrol). Strangely I don't recall seeing the season 2 episodes either in the reruns.

Anyway, season 2 is absolutely awesome. The acting and plots of the show, to me, is ageless. And that's testimony to Jack Lord's extreme dedication to this series.

Almost forgot, the one problem I encountered was the packaging. Specifically, of the 6 plastic clips the disc hub pops onto, half of them were broken off, on both sides of all three folding DVD cases. The 3 remaining clips are still able to hold the DVD, just barely, for calmly handling it around the house.",1344902400,2,1240,4.648401826484018

2818758,5,B000PGTPC8,"The second season of Hawaii Five-O is terrific. There are some good comic moments, usually at Kono's expense and one on Chin's. (That line on Chin Ho Kelly cracks me up). Season 2 also features some future famous stars such as Martin Sheen, Eric Braeden & Academy Award winner Christopher Walken. It also boasts two episodes with storylines which were developed to better effect in CBS' action, suspense & drama-oriented reboot of this long-running series. This series may not be to everyone's liking, but it's a family show, of which, sadly, there are few examples on TV these days. One minor gripe: the episode ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" is not included in this set. Yes, the circumstance which led to the episode being shown only once and then not included in syndication packages or on the DVD set is regrettable, but, come on, get over it, CBS. Include the episode as a bonus feature in another DVD set of Hawaii Five-0. All I gotta say is, ""Book 'em, Danno.""",1322784000,,963,4.704142011834319

The 2nd season is much better than the first, when they were just gettin' their feet wet.  Every episode is great.  Already in the 2nd season, actors are being repeated as bad guys and others, but it doesn't matter - it's kind of funny.  And Wo Fat shows up twice in the 2nd season.

The shows were crisply written and produced and really awakened mainlanders to what Hawaii looked like - not just the picturesque islands, but the gritty and unkempt parts of Honolulu, with pretty unsavory characters.

Now with season 2 I see why my parents did not watch it much.
I know Jack Lord was the star of the show but enough is enough and it seems he is at every murder in Hawaii day or night, no matter how big or small. The head of the state police should have his underlings do the dirty work.
The one thing that really gets me though is when McGarret goes undercover when everyone and his dog knows what he looks like.

Disc 5 on the set has some of the best episodes so far:
1. Killer Bee
2. Cry, Lie
3. The One With the Gun
4. Most Likely to Murder

2818798,5,B000PGTPC8,"Thank heaven Hawaii Five-0 is available on DVD now, almost through season 6.  Six more seasons to go after that.  I do have every 5-0 episode ever aired, but they're all on VHS, and most of them have small cuts in them -- cuts I never noticed until I watched the DVDs of the show.  I've become a walking talking encyclopedia of a good deal of 5-0 trivia.

One obvious thing that diehard 5-0 fans immediately notice is that many significant scenes or parts of scenes cut from the series during its years in syndication are now restored.  In many cases, those restorations have been pivotal, important scenes that tied many events together.  By the time WGN was airing the series, so many cuts had been made in each episode that most of the time the show made little sense.  Now with the DVDs, everything makes sense, including the mistakes.  Mistakes are part of every show, and they make great fodder for discussion among fans.

But there's a problem when it comes to the DVDs for Season 2.  Whoever put these DVDs together did the show a great disservice by OMITTING one of its episodes -- the very last episode in Season 2, ""Bored, She Hung Herself.""

For years there were two 5-0 episodes that were almost impossible to obtain:  ""Six Kilos"" in Season One [a terrific episode!] and ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" in Season Two.

I'm not sure why ""Six Kilos"" became so hard to obtain, or why it was banned. It's a great episode for many reasons and it does not and never did encourage anyone to use or distribute drugs of any kind.

I have a nagging memory [which may be faulty] that ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" got itself banned because not long after viewing the episode, someone actually attempted trying to hang him/herself in real life and ended up dead.  There was some attempt to put the blame on 5-0, but it came to nothing.  That's what my nagging memory recalls.  I'm not at all sure if I am correct.

But for whatever reason, ""Bored"" was banned in syndication.

""Bored"" made the most sense for those of us who were part of the counterculture in the late 1960s, when all kinds of prohibited things were being discussed and/or experienced, with various, not necessarily positive, results. We did a lot of nutty stuff back then, and lots of that stuff could have been very dangerous.  But the bulk of us are still here.

So I was thoroughly surprised when I finally got my hands on ""Bored"" and watched it.  It's not a very good episode.  For the most part, I not only wondered what on earth all the fuss was about; it bored ME (and I didn't hang myself!).  Very few episodes of 5-0 have that effect on me.

As far as hanging oneself, only a very tiny part of the show dealt with the notion that a character's death was caused by attempting to hang herself for a mental/spiritual/and/or sexual high.  The show quickly made it clear that McGarrett and the rest of the 5-0 team realized that this practice was NOT a cause of the victim's death, and very little about the practice of hanging oneself was discussed in the show.

Unlike most 5-0 episodes in general, this one was certainly one of the poorer episodes I've seen, and I've seen ALL of them, including those ""banned"" while the show was in syndication.  I'd give it a 2-star rating where the highest rating would be a 5-star [and that would be generous].  It's not particularly interesting, and there's nothing whatever salacious or threatening about it.  If anyone believes watching that episode might cause someone else to try to hang themselves to achieve some kind of ""high"", they are at best naive, or at worst, paranoid.

Those of us who are still persistent addicts of 5-0 are legitimately annoyed because we shelled out money for the ENTIRE group of episodes that made up Season Two.  ""Bored"" is not in there.  We've been cheated.

Today's world is a very different world than the 1960s counterculture. There is absolutely no reason NOT to include this episode.

""Six Kilos"", the other difficult-to-aquire episode, is right where it belongs in the DVDs for Season One, and is one of the most interesting [plotwise and visually (when it comes to McGarrett's Hawaiian shirt wardrobe)] episodes in the entire series.  I have no idea why this particular episode became one of the two 5-0 episodes that were banned.

So I cannot understand why, if ""Six Kilos"" was deemed appropriate to include in the DVDs of Season One [which it most certainly is], ""Bored"" is not appropriate for inclusion in Season Two.

So be aware when you buy Season Two of 5-0 on DVD: you're going to be missing the last episode of the season, and for no good reason.

I hope at some point the powers-that-be who make decisions about Season Two on DVD will press a NEW DVD that includes ""Bored, She Hung Herself.""  It's a boring episode, but those of us who are collectors want EVERY episode, even the episodes we don't particularly enjoy.

We all buy DVDs of notable TV series because we assume we will receive EVERY episode in the series, including any pilots or 2-or-3-part episodes.  That's why we spend our money on them.  We want a COMPLETE collection of every season, not a CENSORED collection.

We do not buy these DVDs to be cheated.  In Season Two, we are. We've been censored.  And we're not happy about it.

The First Amendment guarantees us freedom of speech, and omitting ""Bored"" violates that amendment.

Apparently somebody thinks we're still impressionable little children  30+ years after the series originally aired.  We're NOT YOUNG ANYMORE.  We're all grown up and are coloring our hair and buying anti-wrinkle creams.

As parents and/or grandparents, or as aunts or uncles, we know enough to NOT permit small children to watch things that are unsuitable for them.  We assume those of us who have adult children restrict their children's TV/DVD viewing in the same manner.

So to whoever made the decision to omit ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" from Season Two, I have only one thing to say:

""YOU'VE VIOLATED MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH!  YOU'VE CHEATED ME OF A COMPLETE COLLECTION!  AND I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING CENSORED!""",1236902400,6,6067,4.660075329566855

Sure, there were about 8 or 9 episodes that easily explain why this show went on for as long as it did, yet the majority of episodes make you realize the locale and the power of Jack Lord could overcome just about any lack of real story.

I think the show has raw energy mixed with simplicity.  It is not overproduced especially in the earlier years.  The stories were straight forward and McGarret was a no nonsense character who had a knack for breaking down people.  To me the episodes were believable. At that time in television history this show portrayed the cold side of criminals that was usually left up to movies.  The police shows that followed this show continued take network television down a path to the shows we have today. The person or persons that wrote many of McGarret's one liners should have won some type of award.  The show was an original and its worth taking a glimpse at.

As for the VERY long-time planned DVD release: ONE STAR! Why? Other than not having the best image quality and vaguely editing episodes, for one main reason: They've excluded an episode. I don't know why other reviewers here say that they included it (those reviews were dated before it was released). They must be reviewing their imaginations. It states this right on the back of the case:

""The Second Season Episode ""Bored, She Hung Herself"" aired only once and is not included in this set.""

As if that's a reason to EXCLUDE IT!(?) On the contrary, that's THE REASON to make sure it's INCLUDED!!! I don't care how lackluster or controversial, etc. an episode it may have been in some opinions. I never saw it, which makes me want to see it even more. I will judge whether or not I like it. And of course the whole idea of purchasing DVDs of entire seasons is to own/collect ENTIRE SEASONS (EVERY episode). We (collectors) make up the vast majority of those paying $35 or more (TIMES TWELVE) for the collection. Now we have to decide whether or not to continue buying subsequent seasons since the collection will not be complete.

Why did they leave it out? To save the cost of one DVD & Slim Jewel Case?!? That's what it looks like to me. They also state,

""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""

Why? Evidently they trimmed episodes and dumped one just to save some cash. Chopped and hacked collections are priced between $15-$20, not $35-$49.99!  And incomplete collections aren't worth collecting since they have little or no value.  Even a casual fan who would like to see or have all the episodes might as well wait for the complete boxed set rather than having to buy it too just to get that one episode (plus better remastering, less $$$, etc.).

No collector wants an INCOMPLETE COLLECTION (or an EDITED ONE)!

It seemed they used some sort of mirror to highling the actors in the frame and it just follows the actors every movemnt until the next scene.  It was very annyoing the first time I saw it, and then I kept seeing the ""extra lighting"" in all the other episodes.  Other than that minor annoyance, and some skipping, and stuttering of scenes-I think which might be an equipment issue on my end and not a problem with the disks, the collection makes for enjoyable viewing-overall.  Please note that these episodes took place nearly 40 years ago, and some of the content does not translate to today's world.  But, if CBS ever wanted to do a movie based on the series (a current Hollywood trend)  there are many relevant episodes that can be reworked to be scene in theaters today-especially ""Three Dead Cows at Makapuu"".

2818865,5,B000PGTPC8,At last the best cop show ever is on DVD ... We have season 1 and 2 when is the rest on the way........,1186617600,3,103,3.3333333333333335
2818866,5,B000PGTPC8,"First off, for those that have criticized the release for omitting the episode ""Bored She Hung Herself,"" let me remind them that the compilation is billed as ""Hawaii 5-0 - The Second Season,"" not ""The COMPLETE season."" Whatever reason the particular episode is not included is, perhaps, a tale that we fans are not privy to know.

That said, the second season carries on the trend started by the landmark first one: great use of location, brilliant scores, marvelous guest stars, topical storytelling, and the take-ALL-prisoners-approach style of star Jack Lord.

Contrary to the show's critics, Lord does show emotion and breaks into a smile now and then. However, his ""Steve McGarrett"" is all business and has little time for levity and little patience for criminals...and there are plenty of them afoot in the island paradise.

Kudos should also be given to the rest of the 5-0 team: James MacArthur as Lord's right-hand man, Danny; Kam Fong as the stalwart Chin Ho Kelly, and Zulu as the big and lovable Kono. Richard Denning begins his second term as ""The Governor,"" a part that he will keep for the entire run of the series. Harry Endo starts his eight-year run as criminal examiner Che Fong.

This season showcases political turmoil overseas (""Leopard on the Rock"" and ""Savage Sunday""), bio-terrorists (""Three Dead Cows at Makapuu"" and ""Sweet Terror""), brainwashing techniques (""Killer Bee"" and ""A Bullet for McGarrett""), racial tension (""The Joker's Wild, Man"" and ""Run, Johnny, Run""), international intrigue (""Which Way Did They Go?"" and ""Forty Feet High and It Kills""). These episodes, along with the others, blend adventure with social commentary like no other show of the period.

The writers somehow managed to give Lord a ""soliloquy,"" of sorts to deliver to the criminal or some bureaucratic official. And he zesfully delivers!

The line up of guest stars includes familiar faces from the era, along with many soon-to-be-famous television and motion picture stars. Character actors Tito Vandis, James Gregory, John Randolph, Harry Guardino, Albert Paulsen, Charles Aidman, Ronald Long, Joanne Linville, Marc Lenard, Soon Tek-Oh, Khigh Deigh (the infamous ""Wo Fat""), Barbara Luna, William Windom, and H.M. Wynant appear and contribute greatly to several episodes, respectively.

And the list of rising stars includes Martin Sheen, Christopher Walken, Tom Skerritt, Loretta Swit, Ed Flanders, Marj Dusay, Eric Braeden, and ""Grandpa Walton"" himself Will Geer.

One of the best performances is delivered by character actress Doreen Lang in the aforementioned ""Killer Bee"". She plays the cold, unfeeling mother of a psychologically tortured Viet Nam vet and she could give Mary Tyler Moore's ""Ordinary People"" character a lesson in mental abuse of a child. Lang is probably best known as the terrified mother that slaps Tippi Hedren in Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""

James Hong's deliciously seedy ""Tot Kee"" elevates a rather routine ""The Devil and Mr. Frog"" to memorable status.

Even for all its praise, part of the fun of watching the show is seeing how many times certain scenes are repeated, what actors appear in the same season in different roles, and the continuity goofs.

One of the latter involves a little boy seen running outside MacGarrett's office, itself being located on the SECOND floor of the state building.

However, ""Hawaii 5-0"" remains one of the best of its kind and the flawless execution of the disc, in sound and picture quality, is a worthwhile purchase...even with the omission of one installment.",1186531200,8,3530,5.195422535211268
2818867,5,B000PGTPC8,The second season gets better and is a prelude to the next several years of the genius of the show before some of the problems associated with the late '70s productions.  DVD now offers the original teaser promos for the upcoming episodes---nice touch.  This ingenious but simple method of keeping the audience interested in a series will never be this good in this age of commercial inundated television shows.,1186531200,3,411,4.942028985507246
2818868,5,B000PGTPC8,"I thank God that after 27 years Paramount, CBS & Viacom finally released my favorite TV show. I have enjoyed all of season 1 and have finally received my season 2 discs. To sit back and cry over a deleted episode is a joke. Even CBS in the late 60's realized that they had a problem with an episode and decided to not rerun it. So what! I am happy with the remainder of the episodes I did get. What next complain they didn't drive any Chevy's? Complain about Zulu changing his name to Kono? Some people are never happy no matter how long they waited. Get over it morons.",1186358400,6,570,4.1909090909090905
2818869,4,B000PGTPC8,"I can understand the disappointment of completist fans at the omission of Bored, She Hung Herself, and the discomfort created by the warning (note: it IS only a warning!!) about potential editing of some episodes.  But folks, nothing is perfect, and I would rather see the clean and clear reproduction of what IS in the Season 2 release, than not get to see it at all!!!  One episode does not make a whole series, and there are some really awesome episodes in Season 2 ('tho there are the first stinkers too - a Bullet for McGarrett is shockingly bad!) We still get the nuances, story twists and clever and shocking turns; the hot and jazzy music; the colourful, clever and compelling characters; Danno's sharp little zingers and gentle comments (and spectacular blue eyes); Steve's passionate declarations on morality, justice and responsibility; the stunning beauty of late 60's /early 70's Hawaii.  There is nothing nearly as good on current TV, and with the DVD release we get to see it (almost) all without commercials or overtly hacking edits.  PLEASE!!!!! Get over one poor decision by P'mount and SUPPORT the CONTINUING RELEASE of the show!!! Buy Season 2, so it don't go pau, brudda!  Bring on Season 3 wikiwiki!!!

By all means harass Paramount for the missing episode on future releases -similar story lines have been presented since then (6 Feet Under had someone self-asphyxiate when a wedge of lemon fell out of his mouth while he was doing something similar but naughty on a piece of exercise equipment, and that one was aired more than once and released on the DVD. So, come ON P'mount!!)",1186272000,9,1604,4.835766423357664
2818880,5,B000PGTPC8,"This is better than season 1--the pacing is better, the directing is better, the guest stars are better.

Edited episodes doesn't mean syndication style/missing 10 minutes edits.  Apparently what it means is the season 1 opening credits were used, and the only change to those credits would have been the name of MacArthur's character (Danny vs. Danny Williams).  The shows are all 50-51 minutes long!

I hope that this set sells well, and they give us season 3!  The locations, the sets, the fashions, the cars--that 60s/70s style--it's all there.  The music is great, the stories are great, and the colors just pop--the set looks fantastic.  The main disc menu scrolls scenes from the eps while the theme music plays in its entirety, the episode menus have the cool eliptical shapes with the yellow dots to highlight what you want just like on season 1.  I'm glad that we got episode previews this time with Jack Lord's ""Be here, Aloha,"" but I wish that you could watch them at the end of the previous episodes as intended.  Instead you can play them all at once or watch them at the start of the episode previewed.  But that's a very small quibble indeed.

Here's my favorite thing about an old show like this:  no cell phones to move plots along!!!  Cell phones have invaded every other aspect of my life despite that fact that I don't own one, and I'm sick of it.  Now I can sit down and watch an old t.v. show that doesn't rely on them as a plot device!

I'm enjoying these Hawaii Five-0 sets tremendously, and honestly, the episodes are only getting better over time.  You can't go wrong with this set.  Don't let naysayers who complain about a missing episode that only aired once put you off--I agree with Agent 68, they probably had no good source material to use to offer it here.",1186185600,7,1791,4.564263322884012
2818881,4,B000PGTPC8,"Ugh !  Paramount really dropped the ball with this one.
Claming to contain all the episodes of season 2, when in
fact it does not. Left off is the controversial episode
""Bored She Hung Herself"". The subject matter caused that
episode to be the only one never released in syndication,
and now not on the dvd set.

What is here you can read elsewhere,
it's easy to see why this is the best police drama ever !
However I am very disspapointed with Paramount.
I give it 4 stars, instead of 5,  for falling short
of what it claims- once again a network screws up

2818882,5,B000PGTPC8,"I am as big a Five-O fan as anyone.  This set excels, and let me explain why.  First, the quality is phenomenal.  Sharp, color-accurate video, and crystal clear sound.  These episodes never looked or sounded so good!

Second, the episodes are as full-length (near 51 minutes running time) as have ever been seen in re-runs.  For all intents and purposes they are unedited.  Do NOT let the possibility that a few eps MIGHT not be 100% identical (perhaps coming in at a dismal 99.99% instead) to the original network airings deter you from buying this awesome collection!  The packaging doesn't say that some episodes HAVE BEEN edited, it says that some ""MAY be edited from their original network versions.""  I am as much an expert on this show as you'll find, and I've detected no edits whatsoever.  I propound that they're not even sure themselves at this point.  Paramount was at least HONEST by placing the disclaimer on the packaging, for all of the obsessive purists out there.

You see, some episodes were already slightly edited before they re-ran for the first time!  These edits were usually made for good reasons (i.e. to correct errors or improve continuity).  Over the last nearly 40 years, further (horrendous) edits have occasionally taken place, to allow more advertising time.  I've seen time-compressed versions, content-edited versions, versions without credits, you name it.  Believe me, that's not what you're getting here.  I have collected and viewed these episodes in many forms for nearly 30 years.  To my informed eyes, Viacom/Paramount SUCCEEDED in selecting the best, most true-to-original prints still in existence for the remastering and DVD release.  Rest assured, the EDITING IS A NON-ISSUE HERE.  Season two is every bit as original and unedited as season one (which no-one complained about).

As for the missing episode, I admit this is a little disappointing, and the only bona fide flaw with this set.  However, I doubt the omission has anything whatsoever to do with lawyers this time around.  Once again, it very likely has to do with what original sources were available for remastering.  I'd bet money that either a satisfactory original hasn't been located, or that it hasn't been digitally remastered yet.  This episode may yet appear in the future release, who knows?  As others have pointed out, you won't be missing much.  I personally have a (poor) copy of this episode, and it is truly dreadful.

For all so-called fans of this great show, have you considered what effects that your one-starring of this excellent product will have?  If you deter enough people from buying it, PARAMOUNT WILL STOP RELEASING MORE SEASONS!  Is this what you really want?

This set is phenomenal, and thanks Paramount for bringing it to us!  More, please!",1186099200,9,2780,5.002183406113537

I'm still excited to add it to the collection though.
The Salt Lake City area has a local station, KPNZ I think, that had been playing 2 episodes/night(8pm,9pm Mon-Fri ish) for awhile now (past year or so), but up until lately they had discontinued it and replaced it with stupid info-commercials and other lame shows.

When I start a collection of DVDs, I want to see every show in the series.  This collection leaves out the 16th episode ""Bored, She Hung Herself"".  I have never seen this lost episode (it aired only once).  I understand that the content of the episode is disturbing as it pertains to events that have occured today.  Isn't this exactly what T.V. portrays.  All you have to do is look at Law and Order, CSI, NYPD Blue and the myriad of shows that portray the ugly crimes of today in much more grandor and grotesque imagery.  We do not censor the violence, nudity, language and sex of these programs.  I could be wrong, and this episode may indeed be too graphic or disturbing to see the light of day, but our kids watch far worse in their cartoon selections on a daily basis and in their video game choices.  This show was not meant for kids.  It is adult programming, and we should be given the opportunity to decide for ourselves what shows we should watch.  All this set needed was a disclaimer or warning about this episode.  It makes me wonder how many other episodes of Hawaii Five-0 will be cut, and what are the reasons for these.  After all, censorship was tougher in the sixties than today, and this episode did air.  I believe that this sort of censorship is appalling, unless we are going to do the same to every show in existence today.  Five-0 fans want every episode.

2818888,5,B000PGTPC8,"FIVE STARS for HAWAII FIVE-O Season 2.

WHAT'S RIGHT with this set???

1)  Almost all of the ""This is Jack Lord....be here, aloha"" promos are INCLUDED.  There isn't one for ""TO HELL WITH BABE RUTH"" on disc one, but so far I haven't found any others ""missing"".  This means either a) the powers that be actually LISTEN to our suggestions, b) that these promos DON'T exist for season one, or c) both A & B are true!  Each disc contains the four promos for the episodes on that disc, accessable in a set from the main menu OR viewable PRIOR to the appropriate episode.  You can also ""skip"" the PROMO and just watch the episode.  They do NOT appear between the show and the end credits/theme, but rather at the START of each matching episode.  Maybe for season THREE the producers could ""plug"" them into the preceding episode in their correct place (HINT--see above letter ""a"").

2)Once again AUDIO and VIDEO quality is excellent.  Menu design is easy to use.  Packaged in slim line cases inside a slipcase box, 6 discs, 24 episodes.  Well packaged and produced.

What's WRONG with this set??

1) The episode BORED, SHE HUNG HERSELF is NOT included, only a footnote on the back of the box as noted by other reviewers.  As lamentable as this may be, dare I say one can understand the probable reluctance of the legal department to include an episode which might ""give people bad ideas"".  It only takes one nut with a lawyer to make things bad for all of us and heaven knows there's no shortage of either nuts or lawyers in this day and age!

2) Certain, unspecified episodes may be edited.  You may be able to tell which if you carefully watch your DVD timer.  But, unless you've got a fantastic memory of every episode as it aired nearly forty years ago, will you really miss a few seconds here and there??  After all, the episodes are ENJOYABLE in syndication, so why not just ENJOY THEM on DVD (without the annoying commericials!).  Sure, it would be NICE to have them complete and unedited as they were back in 1969-70, but I'd rather have an ""edited"" version than NO version at all!  Episodes run 51 minutes each (except those edited few!).  I haven't watched them all, so I don't yet know WHICH episodes are edited, but ALL EPISODES on discs one and two are full length, 51 minutes.  Perhaps I'll update this later with more time info if I can figure out which are edited!

IN CONCLUSION:  Worth the price of admission.  Still, in my opinion, the BEST police show ever with far and away the BEST theme music of any TV show, anywhere!  Just ENJOY the great TV and try not to think about what's ""missing!""",1185926400,10,2603,4.490405117270789
2818889,4,B000PGTPC8,"Despite the omission of the suppressed episode ""Bored She Hung Herself"", the Season 2 DVD's are very worthwhile.  In addition to 24 gorgeously remastered episodes that look very modern despite their 38-year age, this set features the classic episode promos for most of the shows, which have not been shown in syndication for the early years.  While this extra feature may not be as appealing as season 1's documentary, it still brings added value to this set, along with a stronger collection of episodes and guest stars than was found in Season 1.  William Windom, Loretta Swit, Christopher Walken, Ed Flanders, Eric Braeden, John Colicos, Tom Skerritt, George Gaynes, Mark Lenard, Marion Ross and many others add strong performances to those of the already captivating regular cast. Not to mention Khigh Dhiegh as arch-nemesis Wo Fat in 2 different episodes this season! Menus and packaging is as nice as Season 1.  Definitely worth picking up on Amazon, and helps support a Season 3 release soon, hopefully.  Thanks Paramount for another great job, although I do request that you add ""Bored She Hung Herself"" as a Season 3 bonus episode hopefully.
