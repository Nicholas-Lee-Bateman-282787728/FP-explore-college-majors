8455230,3,B0053HDIJU,"In general I think the film quality of these videos is pretty poor.  My daughter was displaying early signs of autism so we wanted to start early interventions with her to help her learn to ask and answer questions better.  She is smart and high-functioning so maybe these videos would work better for lower-functioning kids, but she did not find them engaging at all.  The film quality is poor, and the jumping around between scenes is jarring, in my adult opinion.",1398297600,,466,4.728395061728395
