8542719,5,B008IEGHS4,"I saw this documentary in Switzerland when visiting last summer. It provides powerful examples about how we can feed the world without resorting to mono-cultures and its use of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. Although Big Ag and the Chemical Industry will tell you that you cannot get the yields by organic farming, this documentary proves the opposite to be true. It is a stark reminder that for a sustainable future, we need to live with nature, not outside of it.",1445904000,,484,4.987654320987654
