306679,4,6301039041,"A capable caper film distinguished by expert performances from a veteran cast. Gene Raymond's turn as the world-weary ringleader is especially noteworthy and a long way from his sappy, lightweight roles of the 1930's. Authentic war hero Wayne Morris is a likable co-conspirator, but unfortunately just two years away from an untimely early death. Professional loser Elisha Cook's presence guarantees a bad end to the best laid plans, and though the movie as a whole doesn't disappoint, the budget appears to be in the neighborhood of $50 tops, as the getaway truck revolves endlessly around Griffith Park. Director Hubert Cornfield looks to be aiming at a breakthrough film on the order of Stanley Kubrick's remarkably successful caper film of the year before, The Killing, but doesn't get it. Plunder Road simply lacks the imagination and panache of its predecessor. Nevertheless the movie merits a look for its spartan virtues, expert pacing, and capable cast.",990144000,13,962,5.253246753246753
306680,4,6301039041,"Well worth a look, 'PLUNDER ROAD' is a tense little crime film that, like so many others did, got lost among the bigger name thrillers of the period. But despite it's relative obscurity the film is a highly entertaining yarn involving a group of thieves attempting to get away with an elaborate gold heist, while facing slim odds.  No big names to speak of, an ostensibly low budget, and a cheeky title (a Mitchum reference?) do nothing to diminish the impact of this scrappy little gem. Check it out.",989107200,11,501,4.629213483146067
306681,4,6301039041,"Hubert Cornfield's ""Plunder Road"" is the story of a carefully planned and flawlessly executed robbery of a train carrying a gold shipment on its way to the US mint. The script, written by actor Steven Ritch, who  plays Eddie, a former car racer turned wheelman, is interestingly spare.  There are long stretches in the film without dialogue, but the script is  terse and incisive, in both its voice-over narration and dialogue. The cast  includes Wayne Morris, who delivered a fine performance in Stanley  Kubrick's ""Paths Of Glory"", and the legendary character actor  Elisha Cook in the role of Skeets, a career criminal with dreams of  escaping to Rio. All of the performances are generally low-key, but  effective. Gene Raymond, as the mastermind of the job, makes for an  interesting gang leader: a laconic, cynical, college-educated tough guy.  The robbery sequence is very well done, and the rest of the film seldoms  lets up in delivering suspense.""Plunder Road"" isn't quite on the  level of John Huston's ""The Asphalt Jungle"" or Kubrick's  ""The Killing"", but fans who like films about well-planned and  perfectly-carried-out robberies that go awry shouldn't be disappointed by  this fast-paced, well-written, and tightly-directed story.",956880000,26,1244,5.3076923076923075

But there is a lot of talking about each other's future with the big haul, yet you know these guys are not going to make it despite a seemingly beautiful plan. It's hard to spot solid gold wheel covers and bumpers in black & white, I guess. There are some ""tense"" moments (by 1950 standards) though no surprises. Liked the occasional location shoots, period vehicles and the fine cast. All may have been more exciting during its first run.

307073,4,6301039041,"PLUNDER ROAD is a late-period, film-noir about a very-well planned heist staged by 5 men. They rob a U.S. mint train and steal 10 million dollars in gold bullion. They then split up the large haul into 3 concealed truckloads and go off into 3 separate directions in an attempt to trick the police with a perfect getaway. They then use 3 vehicles, a moving van, a freight truck, and a tanker filled with chemicals. Needless to say, being a film noir, we know that as events begin to unfold, they will be undermined and caught by circumstances beyond their control. Even though the plan they utilize is an excellent one, quirky events unravel and lead to their downfall. The film makes the most out of a very limited budget by dividing it's narrative into 3 major segments. The film's excellent cinematography is done by Ernest Haller, who also worked on GONE WITH THE WIND(1939),as well as MILDRED PIERCE(1945). Haller's cinematography displays an excellent use of chiaroscuro, which raises the film to a higher level that goes beyond it's small budget. Also, the cast is very good. The lead is played by Gene Raymond, who plays Eddie Harris, the college-educated mastermind behind the well, thought-out plan. Others in the cast include Wayne Morris, Elisha Cook Jr., Stafford Repp, and Steven Ritch, who also wrote the very tight screenplay. Jeanne Cooper plays Raymond's gun-moll, who arranges the gold to be melted down and cast into bumpers and hub caps, which are then placed on a Cadillac. The presence of 40's noir veterans Cook Jr. and Repp, who both played archetypal losers from various noir films from the 40's, gives the viewer a pervasive feeling of doom for this heist, despite the well thought-out plan. The basic irony of the film is that the criminals are ultimately defeated by their own elaborate safeguards. The final shot of the film underscores the fatally noir statement as it abandons it's characters to existential oblivion. After my 1st viewing of the film, I immediately watched the film a 2nd time and was able to pick up on specific clues from the narrative that display the irony of the events as they unravel. The script is very tight with many scenes with no dialogue, which only increased the tension as the film played out. It's running time is only 72 minutes and there is not even 1 wasted minute in the film. Also, the action begins immediately after the credits which draws the viewer into the heist in a heartbeat. The film is very well directed by cult favorite Hubert Cornfeld, who would later go on to direct the 1969 film, THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY, which starred Marlon Brando, Richard Boone, and Rita Moreno. As I previously mentioned, the running time is 72 minutes, it is filmed in anamorphic widescreen, with a 2:35 aspect ratio. In addition, the transfer to dvd is very good to excellent. This is one little gem that many have not yet picked up on and it's a delight! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1390521600,4,2946,4.755859375

307077,5,6301039041,"The print quality could be better, but the story line and acting are solid in this noir thriller about gold thieves making their getaway from Utah to L.A..  For me, the best of the film is its scenes shot in L.A., showing it in all its smoggy late '50s glory, including a visit from the ""Smog Patrol,"" which threatens to upset the thieves' plans, if doing nothing to abate the real cause of smog, which is incorporated into the final scene.  Want to see some classic '50s cars?  PR gives 'em to you in spades, including the one that trumps the robbers' final hand.  Think ""White Heat"" on a lower budget with lesser stars but equally compelling and you get the idea.

307081,4,6301039041,"Here's an entertaining & genuinely suspenseful example of what can be done on a low budget, if you've got some real filmmaking talent. A taut, nervous noir about a carefully planned gold heist & its aftermath, it's a stripped-down, no-frills film that delivers everything it promises. From the tense opening of the robbery itself, to the ways in which Fate overtakes everyone, we follow a handful of life's losers to their seemingly inevitable ends. Their lives are scraped down to the bone, with more desperation than hope to keep them going -- yet if they can just pull off this one job, they'll be set for life. Until the smallest, most inconsequential things go wrong ...

The characters don't ask for any pity, but most viewers will probably have a certain sneaking sympathy for them, which works perfectly for this film. You can sense how barren their lives have become, and identify with their hunger to escape to something better, no matter what the cost. But as with all noir films, that pot of gold is somewhere over an elusive rainbow you can never cross ...

A pity it's not on DVD, but if you can track down a VHS copy, it's well worth picking up -- recommended!",1247616000,3,1175,4.644230769230769
307082,4,6301039041,"This is another of those ""Poverty Row"" film noirs, a crime movie made on a low budget but yet decently acted and certainly entertaining.

Gene Raymond and Elisha Cook Jr. are known actors to classic film buffs but the rest of the cast may not be too familiar. There is no one star in this film anyway but all give good performances, particularly Raymond, the most interesting member of the gang.

The weak link of the film, at least to me, was the ending...but I give it points for originality. Overall, the story was a simple one, but oddly told. I say that because the important things that happened in the film (the arrests of the criminals, for one thing) would be glossed over quickly while minor things would be detailed longer than necessary.

Despite that, the film was interesting thanks to good dialog, realism on the part of the characters and the short running time (73 minutes). I hope to see it on DVD some day.

7809117,4,6301039041,"Seen free on YouTube -- The Danny Whitfield site. His description is: Plunder Road is a 1957 American crime film noir directed by Hubert Cornfield, starring Gene Raymond, Jeanne Cooper and Wayne Morris. Five man carry out an elaborate plan to rob a gold shipment from a San Francisco bound US mint train. To throw the police off the track, they split up and drive off in three different directions.

The transfer was excellent with no skips in either sound or video, and the black and white very effective. It played very well over a fast WIFI connection on my Lenovo ThinkPad.

The movie is really very well done, strong acting, and plausible with perhaps one exception: it's not clear why the bad guys would spend so much time making hub caps and bumpers out of the gold -- they did, after all, store gold bars in the car. All that work led to the final capture, of course, so the director had his reasons.

One point -- you will never forget the final shot of the leader's failed escape -- and the way the camera wipes to the upper right, wiping away the protagonists.
