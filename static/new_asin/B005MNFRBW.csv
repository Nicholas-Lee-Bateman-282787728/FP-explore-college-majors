8479515,4,B005MNFRBW,"Eloy de la Iglesia's ""La criatura"" (""The Creature"" 1977), was a direct affront to the bourgeois society of post-Franco Spain! 'Cristina' (Ana Belen) was your normal Spanish housewife, until one day she miscarried after an incident with a vicious guard-dog at a gas station. After losing her baby, Cristina and her husband 'Marcos' (Juan Diego) take a holiday by the seaside, where a dog (a black German shepherd) similar to the one at the gas station suddenly showed up at the beach and followed her around. The dog again appeared on the road as they were heading back home, and Cristina, now taken with the dog adopted him (Juan was of course reluctant). I won't give anymore of the story away. This was definitely Eloy de la Iglesia's most allegorical exercise: concerning the Spanish State and its rigid conformity to anachronistic and conservative values (the Elite and the Church). In essence, the film was very similar to ""El espiritu de la colmena"" (""The Spirit of the Beehive"" 1973), in its critical analysis of the 'human monsters' around us. This bold and thought-provoking film is very much worth a peek. Ana Belen gave an excellent and memorable performance, as did the rest of the cast: Juan Diego, Claudia Gravi, Barbara Lys. The screenplay was written by Enrique Barreiro, the musical-score by Victor Manuel, and ""Al Alba"" was sung by Rosa Leon. The DVD picture quality by Filmax was very good. Spanish (no English subtitles), PAL format, NR 97 mins. (BTW: In retrospect, I should have bought the Divisa Red version of ""La criatura"", their quality is excellent and it's probably subtitled.)

Love and Peace,
