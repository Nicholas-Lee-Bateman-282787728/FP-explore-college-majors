8579294,4,B000BGQU1Q,"""Voyeur"" is the best erotic TV series that I've ever seen. Smartly-produced, incredibly creative and sexy as hell, it's everything that you'd want in something like this: Well-acted, well-scripted (the writing is almost stunningly good in context) and a cast of some of the hottest women you could collect on screen. The pacing also is ideal; it doesn't get bogged down in exposition or sex scenes that go on too long. And the intelligent presentation of non-linear storytelling is pretty much unheard of in this genre.

The only downside--and it's a big one for me--is that the nudity isn't graphic in nature. The sex scenes, which are plentiful (as you'd expect) are very, VERY well-done, but the exposure doesn't go beyond full-frontal. If we got some additional exposure ""downstairs,"" this would have gotten five stars from me.",1423094400,,831,5.065693430656935
8579295,5,B000BGQU1Q,I chose this rating because I thought it was an excellent display of erotica. Other films are so hardcore and unappealing to the female audience. Voyeur takes you on a fascinating journey into other possibilities.,1358467200,,213,5.114285714285714
8579296,5,B000BGQU1Q,"Three DVDs, 270 minutes, decent stories with minimal junk filler.  Good to watch alone or with a friend.  Only downside is that since there is a wide variety of 15 minute stories, you probably will like a lot of them, but you probably won't like all.  Also, as a warning, these are more realistic than most of this kind - couples actually get into real arguments.",1195171200,,363,4.46969696969697
