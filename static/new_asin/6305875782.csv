1085109,1,6305875782,"I haven't seen the video, but now I definitely won't.  Look at the cover!  It looks as if the New York Mets won the World Series and even titles them as World Champions.  If I recall correctly, and I believe I do, the New York YANKEES won!  How can I reasonably consider buying this video with this huge faux pax staring me in the face.
I guess the Mets must have had their runs recounted in Florida and declared themselves the victor . . .",975369600,,440,4.141176470588236

New York has the Yanks and Mets, Chicago Cubs and White Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers and Angels (if you consider Anaheim a part of Los Angeles).  Well they are called the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.  Since prior to 1958 New York had two National League teams and the American League Yankees the chance for a subway series is much better than for local World Series in LA and Chicago,

As Lawrance (#2 reviewer) Bernabo mentioned in his review, the first subway series was between the Yankees and Giants in 1921.  I grew up in the 1859s when subway series were commonplace.  From 1947 to 1957 there were incredibly 7 subway series, 6 for Yankees vs Dodgers (1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956) and 1 Yankees vs Giants (1951),  The Yanks won 6 of the 7 with 1955 being the only time they lost to Brooklyn.

But with both the Giants and Dodgers moving to the west coast the subway series was no longer possible until the expansion Mets joined the National League in 1962.  The Yanks won pennants in 62, 63, and 64 but the Mets were terrible in those years.  In 1969 the Mets won their first National League flag but now the Yanjs wer going through a bad period. So although the Mets got to the World Series in 1969, 1973 and 1986 the Yanjs were not very successful in those years,  The Yankees won Anerican League championships in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1996, 1998 and 1999 but the Mets were not able to win the National League title in those years.  So this 2000 World Series was the first subway series since 1956.

This one was filled with excitement and drama. Clemens tossing the handle of Piazza's bat being the most memorable.  There was good pitching and they were great teams.  It was a series to remember.  When willthere be another?",1207785600,35,1832,4.456456456456457
7896947,1,6305875782,The series was pretty bad in generall I don't believe I watched the Yankees were hevally favored and they were both in New York the only real exciting event in the series was the game where Roger Clemens through the bat at Piazza. Probally one of the 10 worst world series of all time no Fun at all.,1085270400,,299,4.172413793103448
7896948,5,6305875782,"In the first  Subway World Series since 1956, The Yankees show they are N.Y.'s team. Best games 1,2,and 5.",1020816000,9,106,4.578947368421052
7896949,5,6305875782,"Of the recent Home Video Champions World Series tapes, this 2000 edition featuring the Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets is far and away the best.  There is a little less on the regular season and playoffs than we usually see on these tapes, making room for a historical retrospective on the Subway Series going back to the first Yankees-Giants match up in 1921.  What makes this tape so good is that in addition to capturing all the highlights of the five games series, this particular tape takes the time to dissect the key plays, the prime example of which would be Todd Zeile's ball off the top of the fence in left-center.  They also make much better use of the interviews with the players and especially of Joe Torre in terms of getting his thoughts on the key moments from a manager's perspective.  Consequently, this tape provides some nice insights for true students of the game.  I have four tapes in my collection and this is clearly the best of the bunch and the way they should be doing it in the future.",977702400,44,1026,4.524324324324325
7896950,3,6305875782,Are you people shrink wrapped?  On the cover of the video tape it's full of skankees!  Only one spot on the back has Mike Piazza.  It even has only the Skankee symbol on the front.  Being a diehard Mets fan I found it hard to buy because of that.  Get glasses people!,975888000,3,267,4.0576923076923075
7896951,5,6305875782,"The actual cover shows Jeter in the lower right, Yanks celebrating in lower left and Torre being carried off on his players' shoulders on top.  The picture here is a mistake by Amazon by using the Met version which would've been the cover ONLY if the Mets won.  Don't let this mistaken picture mislead you.  Get the tape!  Yours will show Yankees on the cover.  It's is fantastic.  You're hurting everyone by writing reviews without seeing it.",975715200,13,443,4.688311688311688
