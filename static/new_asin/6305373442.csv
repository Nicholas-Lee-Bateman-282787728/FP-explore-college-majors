7888516,5,6305373442,"As a huge lover of Rumiko Takahashi anime I had no choice but to become obsessed with this hilarious love story. Godai lives in a small room at Maison Ikkoku. Unfortunately his neighbors are freeloaders and constant partyers. He would move out but there's one thing. He loves the manager, Kyoko.
On this VHS Godai and Kyoko agree to help out on Halloween at a fair. Godai is dressed up like a cat demon and Kyoko is supposed to be the ghost of a lady who haunts an old well. Kyoko, however, goes into the wrong well and can't get out. Godai finds her and falls in too. Soon everyone from Maison Ikkoku (including Kyoko's other suiter, Mikado) are all trapped. I'm not gonna give it all away but it's funny.
That's why I give Maison Ikkoku 5 out of 5",994723200,,749,4.319148936170213

Mr. Yotsuya,the best character in this  whole series decides to put everyone in a well. I won't say more than this  but god it's funny,if you even breath watch this series.",949881600,,347,5.178571428571429
7888518,4,6305373442,This volume is not one of the  greatest romantic moments in Maison Ikkoku. The first episode in this volume was invented purely for laughs. The whole wacky Maison Ikkoku gang get stuck in a well during a holiday festival. The  second episode is all about misunderstandings between Kyokyo and Godia.  Poor looser that Godia is belives that he lost Kyoko to Coach Mitaka. This  was my first Maison Ikkoku episode that I have purchased. I assume that  there must be better volumes to purchase. Somehow to me it seems as if the  anime falls really short of the original manga. I have nearly all of the  manga and I was prepared for the characters and the situations. If you are  just getting into the series buy the first volumes first. Do not go  randomly picking videos unless you know what you are getting into.,947548800,,810,4.569444444444445
