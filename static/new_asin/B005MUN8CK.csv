8479810,3,B005MUN8CK,"I expected this movie to focus more on Frank Hill, but Frank Hill was only a small part of the film.  It is a worthwhile film for those interested in the social movements of the early 1900s, but not so much for those searching for information on the life of Frank Little.",1453939200,,271,4.211538461538462

8479812,3,B005MUN8CK,"Except for the dramatic assertion that Joseph McCarthy (of Red Scare fame) was arrested in the roundup of wobblies - which is not mentioned in anything I could find about him, this was a very well done film about a troubling event.",1439769600,,231,4.523809523809524

8479814,1,B005MUN8CK,"Review of ""An Injury to One""

I bought this documentary because a fellow professor at my school told me about it.  I teach business ethics and I'm a history buff--especially the history of the American West--so I was looking forward to watching this film.
I have to say, this is one of the most disappointing documentaries I have ever seen.  I should say only partially seen--I had enough after about twenty minutes.  I agree with reviewer J. P. Farren assessment.
Wilkerson tries to be ""arty"" rather than telling a straight-forward tale.  As the blurb on the cover says the documentary supposedly ""provides a taut, suspenseful narrative, interwoven with the history of the American left, McCarthyism, environmental destruction, and even the birth of the detective novel.""  All those elements are there, but presented in a stilted, self-conscious manner--the languid presentation of song lyrics--I'm surprised there wasn't a bouncing ball so that we all could sing along--the narrator's tone and delivery is so dry and languid, that, had he witnessed the Hindenberg disaster, he would have put me to sleep telling about it.
Contrast this documentary with ""Harlan County U. S. A.  The topic is very similar--miners vs. big business.  Even granting that Wilkerson is dealing with an historical event, while the events in Harlan County occurred in 1973, the differences couldn't be more stark.  ""Harlan County U. S. A."" leaves you with your stomach in a knot and outraged at the mine owners, while "" An Injury to One"" leaves you bored and wondering what's for dinner.",1423699200,,1564,5.078125
8479815,1,B005MUN8CK,"Slow, lazy, quiet voice of narrator is drowned by the background music.  Hard to sit and listen to.  Information is not covered in much detail.  Long slow images with music and on-screen text.  Would be better as a small booklet or brochure rather than an agonizing slow video.

I couldn't stand it and turned it off half way thru.  It now resides in the round file.",1392422400,,366,4.46969696969697
8479816,5,B005MUN8CK,I just saw this during a film festival and it was awesome.  Very powerful film.  Extremely well planned out by the director. moving and outrageous. I will purchase this soon.,1367452800,,174,4.766666666666667
8479817,5,B005MUN8CK,The music is great and the images very stylized with a great sense of graphic design and the story  takes interesting twists and turns you don't expect (e.g. Dashiell Hammett and the cooper barons). One of the most innovative films i've seen in a long time.,1358812800,,257,4.586956521739131
