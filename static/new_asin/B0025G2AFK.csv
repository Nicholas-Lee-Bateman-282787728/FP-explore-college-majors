8351053,5,B0025G2AFK,"Funeral Parade of Roses is an absolute force of avant-garde filmmaking. Blending reality and fiction, goofiness with brutality, and sexuality with violence - Funeral Parade of Roses is a beacon for film's most radical potential. The Cinelicious release serves this fabulous film very well. The restoration looks great! The second disc of eight short films by Matsumoto is a wonderful supplement - each proving to be more avant-garde than the next. My only criticism of the release is the design work of the blu-ray sleave leaves a lot to be desired. The film and the quality of the content on the discs are all superb.",1516665600,,618,4.895238095238096

 A taste for experimental filmmaking is absolutely essential for this Japanese production about two transvestites vying for the attentions of a club owner. There isn't much more to the plot than that  excepting a final revelation that explains the younger ones infatuation. That surprise is unfortunately too heavily hinted at in some of the writing about the film but I won't tip it off here. In some ways it, and the premise itself, is what Alfred Hitchcock called a McGuffin. Here it serves as a pretext for telling the events in a crazyquilt of film (and other) styles. Though virtually unknown today  and perhaps even in its time  it was admired by, and even influenced, other directors. Stanley Kubrick cited it as an influence on his A Clockwork Orange; the handling of a shopping mall sequence and speeded up action set to classical music are among the obvious cribs. And one cant help but wonder if a scene where the two transvestites argue courtesy of comic strip word balloons might have had some affect on Edgar Wrights Scott Pilgrim vs the World.
 Influences run both ways of course and the fingerprints of Jean Luc Goddards Breathless are discernible on this Japanese New Wave entry. But that shouldnt be much of a surprise as the film seems like a compendium of film styles and techniques  not to mention nods to other media. Director Toshio Matsumoto includes surreal sequences, documentary in the form of man and woman on the street interviews (which may have been scripted for mall I know), flashbacks that extend what weve seen before  or maybe they're flash-forward glimpses of what we will see (the timeline of events is not always clear, probably deliberately). And its all captured in icy black and white  which unfortunately makes the subtitles nigh impossible to read (Im lucky if I was able to catch a third of them). What is perhaps most remarkable is that the film was made in the same year as the Stonewall riot and mainstream U.S. filmmakers were still trying to come to grips with depictions of homosexuality on screen. In such films as Midnight Cowboy the portrayals were hardly positive yet the characters here are quite open and unashamed. That alone makes this film quite remarkable.",1516579200,4,2308,4.8253164556962025
8351055,5,B0025G2AFK,"Toshio Matsumoto created an amazing slice of cultural production in his first full-length feature film ""Funeral Parade of Roses"" (aka ""Funeral Procession of Roses"" and ""Bara no sretsu""). Matsumoto blends so many story-telling and film-making techniques that the whole films is one massive, dreamy stream of avant garde stream of soliloquies, breaking of the third wall, interviews, quotes, music interludes, comics, costume exchanges, etc. The impossible is completed and this bouillabaisse of film is a beautiful, entertaining and irresistible fantasy.

This story follows the Oedipus Myth, yet it is set in 1960s Tokyo with gorgeous black and white cinematography which makes the dreamy setting look as dated as the 1930s or as recent as the 1980s. Club owner and playboy Gonda (Yoshio Tsuchiya) is involved in a love triangle between aging drag queen (Osamu Ogasawara) and the youthful go-go dancer and hostess Eddie (Peter, aka Pt or Shinnosuke Ikehata). As the two feud, Eddie reminiscences of murdering his own tormenting mother(Emiko Azuma) and her lover. As events unfold, the partying, romances, infighting and surrounding clashes of student protesting in 1960s Tokyo reaches a gory climax with a shocking revelation.

Experimental film, documentary, myth, poetry, art and fiction are bent and blended as much as gender, sex, sexuality and sexual orientation. There are a lot of trippy scenes and gnarly images as well as humor, erotica and drama. Peter is excellent as the star-crossed free-spirit Eddie managing great talent in facial expression from mourning to annoyance at a hair salon as well as feminine mannerisms. The poetic interludes and introductions, not narrated but simply shown with place-cards, are beautifully apt, touching and philosophical. The little touches of experimentalism in scenes like the cat fight in the club where the characters wardrobes transform to fit a duel or how onlookers form to rubberneck the event. This is one of many samples of experimental filmmaking paired with traditional narrative and mythology working very well together in the film, but it is best to watch the movie yourself to see how Matsumoto does it through the whole movie. Many viewers can recognize the influences this film would have on film director Stanley Kubrick and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange</a>&nbsp;with the sped up action synchronized with European classical music. With frank depictions of sex and other sensitive subjects as well as gory violence, this film is not for everyone. But if you can handle such topics, this can be an entertaining masterpiece and gem of cinema for you. It is a shame this is not available on all DVD regions.",1343779200,12,2794,5.5717647058823525
