8509877,5,B0074FUSSS,"Fantastic musical experience. Audio quality is very high, although the filming seems a little less so. But that's probably due to the way it was shot and to a lesser extent, the location. Can't wait to see these guys live.",1390780800,,222,4.575
8509878,5,B0074FUSSS,My husband and I love the Band of Heathens and this set has a great set list.  I highly recommend it.,1366934400,,101,3.8095238095238093
8509879,5,B0074FUSSS,"Fantastic concert, fantastic band.  Every once in awhile traveling through the U.S. I get worried about the state of music in this country, and frankly, the entire world.  A big reason for that is the music magazines I read in airports.  Seeing pictures of good looking idiots partying in LA and being feted for being good at programming a computer can be pretty disheartening.  Thankfully, the Band of Heathens are here to save the day.  It's obvious from their covers on archive.org bootlegs (Sweet Virginia, Brown Eyed Women, Ain't No Cane, the theme of the British Office, etc.)  that they understand rock and roll and what makes a song great.  What's even more obvious from hearing their original song writing is that they are carrying that rock and roll torch to this day. These guys are legit musicians and this is maybe the best place to start with their music.  This is a concert album up there with Waiting for Columbus, Get Yer Ya Ya's Out, Europe 72, Rock of Ages, Fillmore East, etc.  The music is essentially the best parts of the Band and Little Feat (I know no one has ever compared these guys to those two).  Speaking of Little Feat and Waiting for Columbus, I'd love to hear these guys with a horn section as good as Tower of Power.  Wish I could have been there and hope they come up to Alaska soon.

Edit: Meant to mention that the DVD comes with a CD of the show as well, which I didn't realize.  I ended up buying the MP3 album before receiving the physical copies, but didn't mind spending the money twice since these are a band everyone should support.",1338163200,2,1576,4.507042253521127
