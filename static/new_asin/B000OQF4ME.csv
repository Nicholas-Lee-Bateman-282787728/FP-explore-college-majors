8321950,5,B000OQF4ME,"My daughter (11 years old) came home from tennis camp terribly upset; she needed to catch up to her peers , and quickly!  Wilkison's Attacking the Net DVD, really improved my game, so I started her with Beginning Tennis Tekniques.  She quickly got the hang of it and found that it really helped her gain confidence.  Now her mom, and my wife, practice using the video, getting them both out on the court and having a good time; this is something I was never able to do!

Thanks Tim!",1176076800,,482,4.382022471910112
