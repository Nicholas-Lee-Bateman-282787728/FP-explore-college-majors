8376547,4,B002P2S9UO,"A near 2-hour concert from this seminal Ivory Coast reggae band at the Olympia Theater in Paris in '09. They address people in French so good luck figuring out what the singer's banter mean unless you speak French, but luckily much of it was edited out. The energy blows the roof and the band plays flawlessly. The sound is heavily Pro-tooled but I'll take that over raw sound and mistakes anyday.

The gig was filmed, not videotaped, and it's a double layer DVD with 2 lossy audios, so there's no excuse for the digital artifacting I could constantly spot on my.... CRT TV !! Not a deal-breaker, but annoying.  It's indeed a somewhat poorly authored/transfered affair but the musicianship and showmanship more than makes up for it, hence my knocking off one star from what would have been an otherwise perfect DVD experience.

But enough of the criticism; the sound, esp bass and drums is so incredibly well-mixed you'll have trouble keeping your socks on at moderately loud levels. Not so impressive for the first songs, but after less than half an hour someone realized they had to crank the bottom end a little more and WOW ! My mains are capable so I didn't even need to switch my sub on, which is a rare occurrence IME. I could have used the dual guitar attack louder in the mix as it's on their records but maybe it was their choice to have a lower, less edgy guitar sound for the gig, making the bass, drums and wind section more prominent. The overall result does work after all.

I didn't know 5 of the musicians were white nowadays !!

Great to add my collection for the amount of money I paid (cheap).  It's a lovely product.",1475712000,,1637,4.513513513513513
8376548,4,B002P2S9UO,"I'd like to know if this is high-definition video and good sound quality, or the same poor quality as on UToob. Love watching the concert on UToob, though, in spite of poor audio/video quality.
Thanks in advance for any comments. I love AB.",1414800000,,240,4.604651162790698
8376549,2,B002P2S9UO,This item was made in the PAL format rather than NTSC and so it cannot be played on a region 1 usa dvd player,1392854400,,109,3.5833333333333335
8376550,1,B002P2S9UO,"I am absolutely certain if I was able to watch the DVD ,I would LOVE IT ,but I couldn't play it on my system because of the format (no excuse ) ,therefore ,as much as I love Alpha Blondy. I have to say I hate It . I am Sorry.
I was looking forward to watching it this evening  with my wife and found out ""this type of disc cannot be played "".Not Good. Please don't buy this DVD.",1380412800,,378,3.7848101265822787
8376551,1,B002P2S9UO,"I received the DVD quickly and was disappointed to find that it wouldn't play. After checking the box, I found it was PAL format for Europe. The disc came from Brazil so I guess they use PAL ther also. I don't know what to suggest except Amazon should have choices for the buyer...PAL or NTSC.",1351036800,2,293,4.345454545454546
8376552,5,B002P2S9UO,Be careful when you order.  I received the DVD and it was in PAL format and did not play in my DVD players.  Just make sure it is NTSC format so that it will play on a USA DVD player.  I saw the Alpha Blondy DVD at my friends house and his was NTSC format and played perfectly and was a GREAT concert and DVD !,1337040000,2,310,3.6666666666666665
8376553,5,B002P2S9UO,"This is an excellent concert and played flawlessly on my ""U.S."" DVD player. It is NTSC Region 1, so I don't see any problems in playing it here. If you are an Alpha Blondy fan, or even mildly interested in Reggae, buy it now. He is in excellent voice, the band is very tight, and the backup singers are superb.
The audio is dolby digital 5.1 and the video is great as well. Filmed live at the Zenith, Paris.
Awesome.",1329782400,2,416,4.2125
8376554,5,B002P2S9UO,"Despite the fact that this DVD is a Pal Region 2 version and will not play on US systems, I still give it 5 stars. I was able to play it on my Dell desktop with no problems. I saw Alpha Blondy a few years ago and was a little disappointed with his performance and his band. Now his band,back up singers and his stage presence are awesome. This concert was filmed and edited flawlessly! You can have this DVD converted to NTSC for about $15 and it will be worth every penny. I suggest you buy 2 copies for yourself while the costs are low and while the DVD is still readily available. This is sure to become a collectors item!",1324080000,2,625,4.131147540983607
8376555,1,B002P2S9UO,I was so disappointed when I received my copy of Alpha Blondy & The Solar System: Live in Peace Tour.  It would not play in my U S dvd player.  Had to return it and I did receive refund.,1310428800,3,186,3.7435897435897436
