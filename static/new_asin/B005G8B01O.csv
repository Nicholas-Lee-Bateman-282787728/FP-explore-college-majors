8471423,4,B005G8B01O,"This really is an excellent telling of Dostoevsky's life and loves.  Indeed, it might have been more aptly titled ""Dostoevsky's Loves"" as it focuses more on the women in his life than on the literature.  Still, it is very well done, beautifully filmed, and wonderfully acted.  I had no idea that Dostoevsky's life was as passionate and wild as the characters in his books!  I do highly recommend this work, though I can't give it five stars simply because the subtitles are poor (as others have said), that it was sometimes difficult to follow - given the many flash-backs - and because it lacks a ninth chapter.  We do not see what drove Dostoevsky to write The Brothers Karamazov, though it is alluded to at the end of the eighth episode. Still, I was left wanting more (his death, his legacy, etc.) but that is not really a true deficiency.",1429401600,4,843,4.593333333333334
8471424,4,B005G8B01O,"The writer Dostoevsky is very much the product of a life lived large. This series captures the living drama that was Fyodor Dostoevsky. It is fascinating to see represented the major chapters of his life, including people who particularly impacted him. The depiction of Turgenev, for example, does a good job of capturing the devolution of their friendship (which led to his scathing caricature of Turgenev, thinly veiled as the older Verkhovensky in Demons). His own struggles with political activism, spiritual issues, gambling, marital fidelity, and epilepsy, as well as his observations of poverty from close up, all are represented. This is not a complete picture of the man (who did actually have a lighter side), but it does present many glimpses into the events of his life which shaped his approach to literature.",1391990400,9,822,5.141791044776119
8471425,4,B005G8B01O,"I am very surprised that such a big production with wonderful actors, good director - simply a very well done movie - is flawed by very poor, often just grammatically incorrect, subtitles.  Other recent Russian movies such as Doctor Zhivago (2006) and the Idiot (2003) have much better subtitles.  It is still a very good movie, especially if you understand Russian or watch with someone who does.  (I speak Russian)",1342828800,14,416,4.914285714285715
