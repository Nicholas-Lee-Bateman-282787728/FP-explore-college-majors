I want one badly! I didn't realize it was 7 seasons long. Great cast and writers and I can't get enough of
Catherine McClements! Will it ever be available again in it's entirety, all of the episodes? Can I be notified
when it is for sale again? These Australian series have American TV beat by a millenium. Bring 'em on!",1467676800,,401,4.153846153846154
