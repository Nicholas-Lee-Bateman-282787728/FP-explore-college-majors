I used this video to recruit kids to play strings at school.",1335139200,,266,4.448979591836735
8092222,1,B000BTC5MG,"To describe this video as awful would actually be conservative statement.  To start with the room has a huge amount of reverberation so why bother.  You can get the same audio playing in a parking structure.  To start with his goofy dress up attire is no longer amusing.  It is absurdly over staged.  He is the only one dressed up.  The chamber group is attired in typical understated fashion. Aside from Kennedy's dress he plays with his neck bent so far over as to look painful.  His forehead has been sprayed with some type of water or oil to look as if he is sweating from the huge expenditure of energy required to play this concerto.  This is the same concerto that he probably played with ease at six years old.  It doesn't seem that anyone else if feeling the heat in the cool church.

I will only cite two musical sections.  The long notes in the Andante for the Concerto in A minor were played without vibrato up until the end where it was introduced yet very unstable.  Increasing tempo and not using vibrato to sustain the long notes renders this student level playing. It is not a case of trying to make is sound like you are using period era instruments. When not playing he swings his bow around as if he were in a Star Wars light saber fight.  In the Allegro Assai he ran faster than a soldier with amoebic dysentery to the latrine.  It is impossible to discerned all the notes in the runs if in fact they are even being played.  It is not even virtuosity just for the sake of it. This goes way beyond tasteless.  He adds a virtuoso cadenza that is totally out of character.  It is as if the piece was specifically played in a fashion so as to display as much disrespect as possible to the composer.  This playing cannot even be classified as showmanship.  At best he is attempting to sell this to  you untrained ears as an anomaly in their collection of hip hop and rap music.  Don't waste your money or your time on this.",1329004800,2,1939,4.345403899721449
8092223,5,B000BTC5MG,"One has to hear Nigel Kennedy in order to believe that his degree of virtuosity is possible.  Even more so, he brings an intensity to, understanding of and feeling for the music that is nearly unearthly.  Bach is not the most emotional of composers but the pairing is magical.  Wherever he is, I know that Bach can only be marveling at Nigel Kennedy's performance and intricate comprehension of the pieces performed.",1242432000,2,416,4.830985915492958
8092224,5,B000BTC5MG,"Excellent performances from Nigel Kennedy and the orchestra in a wonderful, relaxed setting.  Everybody seemed to thoroughly enjoy the evening.",1178582400,3,143,6.15
8092225,5,B000BTC5MG,"This is an absolutlely beautiful DVD.  What comes across most is Nigel Kennedy's personal warmth, which dominates the whole performance -- one finds oneself smiling with pleasure at the continual warm intereactions between Mr. Kennedy and the orchestra and audience. If you love music and you love people this DVD is for you.

Mr. Kennedy clearly has great love and respect for music, and his superlative technique gives due honour to Bach's music. And the whole presentation backs up Mr. Kennedy's brilliance -- the lighting, the camera work, the atmosphere, they all contribute to an uplifting experience.

I recommend this DVD without reservation -- you'll love it.",1163808000,8,668,5.224299065420561
8092226,2,B000BTC5MG,"""Cool""?  You mean like Fonzie in ""Happy Days""?  Or like Chuckles the Clown in the old MTM show?  Virtuoso violinists are coming out of the woodwork these days.  So why tolerate a conceited idiot?  Heifetz was conceited and he was a virtuoso and he doesn't ""bore me to tears.""  I've heard Kennedy (where did he ever get a name like that!), he can play, but it's not worth the garbage that goes along with it.  I gave him one star because as long as I don't have to look at him, he can play well enough.  They all can.",1150934400,3,516,4.141414141414141
