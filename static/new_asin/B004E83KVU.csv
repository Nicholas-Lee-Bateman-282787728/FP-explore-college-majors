4336050,5,B004E83KVU,"Sometimes... Miracles DO Happen!

One of two that happened to me this year (The other was running into A Long-Lost Love at The Grocery Store -- And on Christmas Eve! -- after NEARLY A DECADE a la Steve & Jaime in RM1!) after YEARS of waiting was the Universal Studios (Produced and Released via Time Life!) DVD Home Video Release of a Six Million Dollar Man Complete Series Mega-Set which was released EXCLUSIVELY to Region 1 after years of us Region  1 people basically getting everything (due to rights fights) later, worse, and incomplete as compared to ""The European / Asian Versions!"" which almost always featured better transfers, extended cuts, and often featured more bonus materials!

This MASTERPIECE RELEASE includes:

>  A lovely keepsake box which has a ""lenticular"" cover which shows Steve manfully running in Slo-Mo as seen in the opening credits when you tilt the box up and down and which also replays Richard Anderson's infamous ""Gentleman, we can rebuild him, we have the technology...""  line (over-and-over again) whenever you open the box (it gets REALLY annoying) and there (fortunately) is a lil' slider-switch four-inches down on the audio unit within the box's back wall which allows you to turn this cute-yet-annoying feature off.  All 5 Seasons are included in their own individual 5-7 disc DVD color-coded volumes  -- which may be how the individual seasons will be released in 12 months when they may/may not be released and, if released, with an unknown amount of the Bonus Materials that were part of this set.  There is also a Bonus DVD Volume, in this release, comprised entirely of Bonus Material DVDs including The Reunion Movies, the Extended 2-Parter/Syndication Versions of all 3 of the Pilot Movies, and many interviews/documentaries with Lee Majors, Lindsay Wagner, Martin Brooks, Richard Anderson, Kenneth Johnson, and many others who were involved with the production or whom have been very active in it's continued off-the-air fan-life.  The disc-trees within the cases are this sets ONLY major weak-spot as they can easily break; they should have used the type of disc holders that CBS used for the Dynasty DVD Releases -- and some people are also reporting that some zooming/cropping may have been applied to the transfers of some of the episodes which I can't ascertain.  I do think there was some of this used on The Return of The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman as their faces look bigger in certain key dramatic scenes which actually does suss-out the acting a bit more.  The re-mastering of the episodes was very well done and they actually look better in this release then they probably ever did during their initial broadcast/re-broadcast(s) and/or or previous Home Video Releases.

This release really is A Love Letter to The Fans (Thank you Universal, you rock, and you gave me by best birthday present EVER!) of these two series and also to fans of 70's pop-culture in general as these two shows were the two final hold-outs to not be released on DVD.  Bionic Woman Season 1 is also now available and Season 2 and Season 3 are reportedly on the way as well.  What's very gratifying, aside from us finally getting the goods, is that EVERYONE involved seems to now at last understand what a MASSIVE IMPACT that these two very special shows REALLY had, just how big they REALLY got, and that they are only now getting their well-deserved alcolades (and their stars their just residuals) for a television and film-maklng odyssey that has lasted over 30 years and a fandom which has lasted over 40.

My own personal take has always been that the secret to the initial and enduring following and popularity of these shows is that they were internally/externally powered by:

1) Something about a Super-Powered Man & Woman (Heroic Male / Female Archetypes in love with being with one another and working together as Jaime wasn't just ""Steve's Girl"" she was also his equally-matched counter-force/counter-point!) deeply appealed to the cultural and collective unconscious of those growing-up in the rousing mid-to-late 70's when The Women's Movement Achieved Critical Mass and the joint and the cross-over episodes showcasing what a powerful man and woman (and archetypal male and female energies) could look like when harnessed and in action together as equals that were perfectly balanced.

2) The highly compelling (And Very Odyssey-esque!) 30 Year Love Story between Jaime and Steve -- one that proved to be so popular/powerful that Universal later then had to pay-through-the-nose to resurrect Jaime in the face of fan grief/outrage over them (moronically) killing her off -- and also by exceptional characters who faced-down death, returned stronger, and in the process became better, stronger, faster... like all of us do in this life... occasionally in Slo-Mo and frequently with Bionic Sound Effects!  Our greatest tragedies and greatest losses often become our greatest humanizers, strengths, and (sometimes) the genesis of our Super-Powers.

3) The love that the characters on-screen + cast and crew clearly felt for each other off-screen.

I don't think either series would work as well now as they did then if they were launched on television today, as something about running/jumping in Slo-Mo seems dated, cheesy, and uniquely 1970's but for some reason it really worked then and it continues to really work now for these two shows and (within this format)  it doesn't seem inappropriate or dated at all though it would in any other context or show released today.

The set includes:

> All 3 Pilot Movies in both their Original and the (later) Extended 2-Part Episodes for Syndication Versions:

- The Moon And The Desert
- Wine, Women, And War
- The Solid Gold Kidnapping

> All 3 Post-Series Made-For-TV-Telefims (Never available on Home Video in Region 1 before now!):

- (1987) The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man And The Bionic Woman
[The Best of the three Telefilms + The Best Score (By Marvin Hamlisch!) and The Very Worst + Most Cliche 80's Doos and Threads circa 1987 (So you know just how bad that they are likely to be!).]

- (1989) Bionic Showndown
[A Very Worthy + Near-Seamlessly Produced Follow-Up / Companion Piece to ""Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman"" that also featured a Very Young Sandra Bullock as the second Bionic Woman!]

- (1994) Bionic Ever After
[The Weakest of the three which has (surprisingly) improved a bit with age and which does feature their wedding and a revisitation of old themes.  The producers (sadly) royally messed-up by deleting The Joint Credit Sequence that they developed and used for the first two Reunion Movies which showed those timeless scenes of them running 2-gether in Slo-Mo through The Hills of Ojai in Their Bell-Bottoms + Their Bionic Implant Techno-Shots -- and also used an incredibly crappy and dated ""digital"" font for the opening credits.]

(*  It should be noted that when you add-up both series and the TV movies this franchise has been on all 3 of the major networks at one point or another which is an ALMOST unheard of feat!)

> ALL of The Bionic Woman Episodes which includes all three of the Originating Bionic Woman 2-Parter Episodes, all of The Cross-Over Episodes, and all three of The Cameo Episodes that occurred on SMDM:

- (Parts 1 & 2) The Bionic Woman [With Available Commentary by Creator Kenneth Johnson]
- (Parts 1 & 2) The Return of The Bionic Woman
- (Parts 1 & 2) Welcome Home, Jaime
- (Parts 1 - 3)  Kill Oscar [The Infamous 3-Parter that introduced the world to... The Evil Fembots!]

> The Bigfoot Episodes:

- (Parts 1 & 2)  The Secret of Bigfoot [With Available Commentary by Creator Kenneth Johnson and an uncredited extended cameo with The Bionic Woman in Part 2]
- (Parts 1 & 2)  The Return of Bigfoot [Which co-starred The Bionic Woman!]
- (Standalone)  Bigfoot V

As a final note, Universal would be well advised to release themed Collector's Sets like Paramount / Star Trek later did for certain fan bases of certain themes (On Trek it was the Borg / Klingons / Q / Romulans / Vulcans / Time-Travel episodes!) and for these series it would make sense to do Collector's Sets based on The Reunion Movie Trilogy, All Six Million Dollar Man Episodes Featuring Steve + Jaime 2-gether 4-ever (A.K.A. The Steve-Loves-Jaime Episodes!), and The Bigfoot Episodes.  I would also like to see an Ultra/Mega/Anniversary Series Box Set which features BOTH series in their entirety, current/new bonus materials, and more box, cover, and disc art featuring Jaime, Steve, Oscar, Rudy, and other Important Guest Stars as this set (though a miracle and quite lovely) was, graphically speaking, far too Steve-centric and this show was a hit because of his posse and guest stars as much as because of him.

As a final Very Special Bonus -- for you fellow obsessive fans -- (and because you now CAN own ALL the cross-over, guest-star, cameo, and reunion episodes if you get this Super Deluxe Mega-Set + The Bionic Woman - Season 1) I have listed-off the correct episodes in their correct broadcast order so that you too can now do the full Steve-Loves-Jaime 4-ever Bionic Marathon whenever you wish  (see below):

4336051,5,B004E83KVU,"After waiting YEARS for this TV series in US Format, it's finally here!!! And it's just awesome!!! All 5 seasons, approx 100 episodes. Plus an additional bonus with many extras. And a collector box with a sound clip from the intro that turns on when you open the box. The video and sound clarity are both fantastic. EVERYTHING about this set is just PERFECT!!! They really put alot of work into the designing and creation of this set. Even the opening panel with Steve in his red running suit (which you can see at the top of the picture), it is lenticular which gives Steve his slo-mo ""running"" effect. I make him go fast-forward and backwards several times, it's so cool and funny, makes it look like he's dancing  :p

Officially Licensed from Universal Studios and NOT available in stores anywhere exept online. This is a keeper til the end of time, whatever price they asking for, this set is worth every penny!!! I would've even paid $500 for such an awesome and colorful set as this. All I can say is WOW!!! I hope they do the same with other series like Manimal and several others.

4336073,4,B004E83KVU,"Ah, nostalgia. Some things are best viewed through rose colored glasses. Six Million Dollar Man is a very good show, by 70's television standards. The effects are, for better or worse, on par with similar shows of the time. The individual episodes are fun to watch, and there is no commitment to sit through an entire season. Episodes consist of self contained stories, with the exception of the occasional two or three part story.  There are no over-arching season long ""big bads"" to bait you, but that's not a bad thing. I would love a modern update to this and the Bionic Woman, but I fear Hollywood would forget what made these shows work. Instead, I will in these classic episodes that my teens find cheesy and over the top, but they still sit by my side and enjoy the ride.",1412035200,,779,4.524822695035461

It strongly influenced me to study robotics and engineering as well as psychology and genetics. The writing and directing, even for a dramatic/action adventure show, did keep things from getting too wild and crazy and ultimately campy in my opinion. While there were times the feats performed by Col. Austin would result in his tearing his bionics limbs off, if he was a real person with those bionic limbs - there were other times that addressed simple issues like how his legs don't run out from under him and how finesse is often the better then straight brute force. I think the choice to show him running in slow motion as opposed to speeding up the film (except in some episodes) was the better one, it lent more power to the scene - like watching a locomotive roll along.",1400803200,2,925,4.511904761904762

The numerous episodes affords my parents an alternative to contemporary programming.  After six weeks of viewing they are well into 4th season.  They like it a lot.  As their heyday was in the 70s I guess it puts them in a familiar frame of mind.
Also before buying I read about an integrated audio circuit, triggered upon opening the box, that replays a clip from  the intro to the episodes. Nothing was heard when the box was opened.  Either the battery connected to the micro circuit was dead since the box was received months before this holiday, or there was no circuit as the existence of such a circuit was not apparent.  However, this rating is for content, not the experience of opening the box.  I read about a counterfeit set.  I viewed the front of the box at different angles to confirm Austin's movement.

Sets were purchased both used and brand new, including one fulfilled by Amazon.  Ways to spot the bootleg sets: the lenticular picture of Steve Austin does not run (he may pivot his head slightly if you're lucky), there is no sound chip in the knockoff box, and the physical size of the box is slightly smaller due to lacking the aforementioned sound chip.  There are also some differences in the quality of the disc holders.  Do yourself a favor...purchase the genuine article from Time Life for the exact same price Amazon is asking here.  I have informed Amazon that their sellers are peddling knockoffs, and they just don't seem to care one iota.",1379289600,9,781,4.798507462686567
4336098,2,B004E83KVU,"I love the series, and the image and sound are very good quality on most disks in the box set. I only noticed a couple of very small spots where the sound has a little static and have not noticed any visual issues worth complaining over. The only issue I have is with the disks used to store the shows. I understand profit is what companies want, but a quality product should be sold to get that profit. The manufacturer definitely cut corners on quality here to get maximum profit, and it shows badly.
 I bought the entire series used and could not be happier with the vendor I got the item from. Quick delivery and well packaged disks that looked as close to new as is possible. So I have no doubt the issues I had with the disks are from the original manufacturer cutting corners.
 Several of the disks are so badly out of balance I had issues with them not wanting to play in my standard dvd player because they would not spin true, or skipping because the whole dvd player was actually shaking since it was so out of balance. I had to use a laptop style dvd player with a locking spindle to hold the disk in position as they would not work on the more common tray load dvd player I had hooked to the TV. All of the out of balance disks were very loud and noisy while spinning to say the least.
 Season 3 disk 1 would also not play in my dvd player due to it being ""incompatible media"". After trying several dvd players I finally got it to play on a computer drive. Looking up the disk media manufacturing data from the normally unread part of the disk it showed as an obsolete disk type that was discontinued from use do to ""layer break issues"". Which means that most dvd players would not play the continents past the middle of the disk, the same issue I was having. Thankfully my computer drive was able to read past this.
 At the price the manufacturer is charging for the box set you would thing the disks were gold plated or something, not discontinued, obsolete, or seconds.",1376956800,2,1985,4.2994652406417115

When you open the box it plays clips from the show from the internal speaker. It's really neat!
The fake box sets do NOT have this sound module & the box is much smaller !!

Even while the main BOOTLEG box is sealed, you can tell right away on the hologram that Steve's head only moves one pivot
(It is SUPPOSED to show him appear to be running with his upper body moving).
The sound card box inside the main box is missing and the box is actually smaller because it was not taken into consideration on the bootlegs.

The discs themselves look fairly real. The disc boxes for each season are cheap and the discs and paperwork are placed in backwards and smashed together.
The bonus discs are falling off the holders, scraping around, because they connectors are so cheap they are breaking off.",1375228800,29,921,4.411764705882353

I called them to replace it and they jerked me all over the place from call back to we don't have any copies available to replace them, to finally theres nothing we can do cause I took so long to ask for a replacement.

4336109,5,B004E83KVU,"One aspect about this show leaped out at me after viewing it for the first time since 1978. Society does not make men like Lee Majors anymore. He is the last of a breed that can command attention for his macho side while retaining a dignity and respect for people that quite honestly this country sorely misses (and needs). In short, the man is a complete gentleman. I miss him. He was (and still is) my first(best)hero from my youth. I grew up in Ky somewhat similar to what he did. And while I lived a suburban lifestyle during the weekdays, I would move out to our farmland during the weekends and put in long days bailing hay, moving cattle, clearing brush, and cutting wood. It was a common sight during breaks to see me running ""slow motion"" style up one of the many steep hills, while everyone slurped on their jugs of water. I would put in 10/12 hour days and couldn't wait to come home that Sunday evening to sit down, cool off, and watch my favorite hero woo the women while 'bionically' cracking the bad guys. And let's not forget Oscar Goldman who was tough but caring. As a kid, I didn't know whether to view him as Steve's boss or a really neat uncle. Don't we all wish we could view our bosses like that! But Lee was the epitome of ""cool"". And the years that have transpired since, have not waned the effect he retains. Quite honestly he is timeless. And if I had my pick of one person on this planet to meet, it would be him. My words would be brief and hopefully dignified since this ole KY boy doesn't like to act the fool. I would say. ""Thank you Lee. Thank you for being a positive role model for my generation. You have a legacy to be proud of. Never doubt you are held in the highest regards and thought of warmly.""",1340064000,22,1737,4.266666666666667

As far as I am concerned, you cant beat all those great 70's tv shows, primetime and Saturday morning tv. The Six Million Dollar Man would have to be my all time favorite, and its about time they did this show justice, and put it on dvd. Not only on dvd, they really did it up, and put everything on dvd. All the movies, pilot, all the seasons, commentary, commercials(toys), featurettes, etc. Its AWESOME! Get it! Just don't pay $300 for it.",1339372800,2,524,4.25
4336111,5,B004E83KVU,"Of all the television box sets out there, this is probably the best box set on DVD of any show...period. All five seasons and outstanding featurettes! I must say...patience is a virtue, and for us North American region one SMDM fans, patience has finally paid off! I bought this direct from Time-Life due to the lower cost.

These episodes were re-aired on the SCI-FI channel years ago, but up to five minutes of footage was edited out of nearly every episode. There are many cut scenes that haven't been shown on television in a very long time. One good example is the hot dog stand scene in the episode Eyewitness To Murder. Another example would be the extended scene in Population:Zero where Steve's campfire conversation with the doctor reveals his frustration and resentment in early episodes towards Oscar and the OSI. One important previously missing scene is in Return of the Robot Maker, as we are introduced to Barney Barnes, the OSI gadget developer. Barney's introduction scene near the beginning was cut out in later reruns, and this made the episode slightly confusing. It's a good chance these episodes have not aired in their entirety since the 1970's.

One thing I have always liked about the series is how they put in ""flashbacks"" and episodes featuring some kind of continuity as to what had already taken place. For example:

Day Of The Robot/Run,Steve,Run/Return Of The Robot Maker (The Robot trilogy)
Eyewitness To Murder/Steve Austin, Fugitive (The Hopper twins)
The Seven Million Dollar Man/The Bionic Criminal (ole' inflation gets us all! What do you think of that Stevie Boy!)
The E.S.P. Spy/Hocus Pocus (Audrey Moss, the E.S.P. girl)
The Last Kamikaze/The Wolf Boy (Japanese soldier Kuroda)
Rescue Of Athena One/Nightmare In The Sky (pilot Kelly Wood)

Run,Steve,Run (flashbacks of Population:Zero/Dr. Wells Is Missing/Day Of The Robot)
Stranger In Broken Fork (flashback of Cyborg pilot)
The Deadly Replay (flashbacks of the Cyborg pilot)
The Secret Of Bigfoot (flashbacks of Population:Zero/The Bionic Criminal/Dr. Wells Is Missing/The Bionic Woman)
Death Probe (flashback of Doomsday, And Counting)
Dead Ringer (flashbacks of the Cyborg pilot)

The Callahan episodes:
Steve Austin, Fugitive
The Winning Smile
Task Force
Kill Oscar

Along with every uncut episode, there are some outstanding interviews....and I do mean OUTSTANDING! These interviews reveal many facts about the making and writing of the show that were unknown to the general public until now. One great example: Ken Johnson mentions that in his script of The Bionic Woman, contrary to what I had always believed, Jaime was supposed to live from the very beginning (albeit in some type of suspended animation). Universal Studios forced the show to kill her off because they wanted the classic tragedy love story. Due to all of the incoming letters revealing the popularity of the episode, they had to go back to the original plan of keeping Jamie alive.

When I was young I loved the show. Remembering back to that time period some of the episodes were actually somewhat disturbing for their time. Several examples:

Cyborg - due to the crash, views of blood, and the very strange surreal testing of Steve in his red warm-up suit. Also some violence as Steve got shot up pretty bad near the end as he was trying to make it out of the desert.

Population: Zero - features a scientist demonstrating that he can kill people with a hyper-sonic wave producer. Steve DOES kill in this episode (which is verbally confirmed by Oscar in the episode Run, Steve, Run) - but only as a last resort to save himself, Oscar, a nice looking red-head doctor, and an Army unit.

Day Of The Robot - this one takes the cake for me because, when I had viewed this episode for the first time, I missed the beginning where it was clear that a robot was involved. So when I saw Fred Sloan turn on Steve and try to kill Steve, that was frightening to say the least. Then when Steve knocked off the robot's face - that scene TOTALLY freaked me out. I was horrified in bed that night after that episode when I was about seven years old. Now? It is one of my favorite episodes.

As a side note, there is also another incident of apparant killing in the episode Dr. Wells Is Missing. During the climax of the episode Steve kicks over a blue car with two men in it, and after the car rolls over a small cliff it explodes into a million pieces without the two men exiting the car. So, during the first season, Steve does resort to killing - but only as a last resort.

The show intro opening was a masterpiece for its time. For every new season the music was slightly changed or altered. There are a few exceptions where the opening or the closing themes of a particular episode were different than that season's normal opening or closing. They are:

Pilot Error - season two episode that features a season one opening sequence with much louder drums. The closing theme for this episode is also slightly different and unique.
Rescue Of Athena One - the closing theme is slightly different.
The Ultimate Imposter - season four episode that features the shorter season one opening sequence with more emphasis on the drums.

The following are what I consider the series' best episodes:

Movie 1 - Cyborg
Movie 2 - Wine, Woman, and War
Season One:
Population: Zero
Day Of The Robot
Doomsday, and Counting
Dr. Wells Is Missing
Eyewitness to Murder

Growing up in the 70s, I could not wait for Friday night and then later Sunday and then I believe towards the end it was moved to Wed night. The show was awesome.  Now, I would like to know why  Amazon is selling this complete set for $350 when Time Life has been selling it for under $250.  Amazon should wear a mask before they rob people.  I noticed that season 1 is selling for about $20 on Amazon.  There are 5 seasons, so if they happen to sell each season at $20 then that comes out to $100.  Go figure - $100 to $350.  Anyway, if someone is reading this and they have not buyed it yet, do youself a favor and go to Time Life and save yourself a deal of money.

This set can be purchased directly from Time-Life's website for only $249.99 and they will even let you pay for it in 5 monthly installments at no additional charge.  Plus free shipping!

Each Season is in a nice plastic case with a booklet to let you know all the episodes of that season including extra stuff which is just packed with so much. The first season has all the episodes where Steve and Jamie are engaged and how she becomes bionic herself. I was a big fan of both shows and now they have released both of them here in the states the Bionic Woman also shoes the same episodes as does the Six Million Dollar Man of how she becomes bionic. Additionally, the box that this 6 year show comes in alone is a treat and a collectable. Each time you open the box the main song of the show starts up as Oscar says we can rebulid him...it sounds cheesey but you will enjoy it! The first year I think I enjoyed the most for it has been so long since I last saw it. Equally important, Farah Fawcett who was Lee's wife at the time had made special appearances on his show. It is costly I do admit but I have a feeling it will only be sold for a short amount of time. Unfortunately, they did not sell the Bionic Woman as a box set so Iam currently buying the Bionic Woman used on DVD by season since there is only 3.",1328400000,,1335,4.022556390977444

I really like Amazon but they need to rectify this, they are seriously over charging for it.  I would really like to thank the reviewers that pointed out this savings.

For what you get, $239 is a bargain.  Note that there are only a couple of negative reviews and I only saw one that said the picture quality is bad.  That guy must have gotten a bad copy or something.  The picture quality is fine, the only complaint I might have would be that you have to crank the volume a bit to hear the dialog sometimes and that makes the music and effects too loud.  I suspect it was this way originally, remember this was made in the days of mono TV, they didn't even have stereo then much less 5.1 or 7.2 etc.

Truth is this set is worth what Amazon is charging for it but save your money and get it from Time Life.  Do a bit of googling first, I found a coupon code that saved 10%.

If you grew up on this show like I did and you want it in your collection don't pass this up.  It will cost more in the end to buy it one season at a time.  Just go for it and get this.

This series has been at THE TOP of my most-wanted DVD list for years, and I must say, I am SUPER impressed with the quality, care and love shown to this (almost lost) classic television action series. Steve Austin is truly a great AMERICAN hero - and a great role model for children of today (minus his beer guzzling). When SMDM first aired (way back in 1973-78), I was between the ages of 2 and 7, but boy, let me tell you, I've NEVER FORGOTTEN this classic show, and have yearned to see it over the years. Now that wait is finally over, and I'm literally getting to watch the series for the ""first time"", because I was so young when it first aired on network television. The intro for SMDM is probably one of the THE BEST (if not THE best) intros for an action show ever created - simply enthralling (a classic in and of itself)! Having now watched the complete 5 Seasons of SMDM, I can honestly say that it is one of my all-time favorite televisions shows. Of course, as any man-made series, SMDM has its share of seasonal ""boffers"" and ""clunkers"", but in my opinion the strong, original episodes far outweigh the occasional bore. If you've never had the opportunity to enjoy great television, this collection cannot be recommend highly enough; chocked full of great sci-fi story-telling,  regular TV guest appearances,  over 17 hours of bonus material, BIGFOOT and a misguided, superpowered Russian Venus Probe  - what more could you want?

I've done various internet searches ever since, hoping to find information on when the remaining seasons might be released, but all to no avail!!++++UPDATE++++ WILL BE RELEASED IN THE UK 16TH JANUARY 2012++++

Imagine my delight to suddenly find out last year that Time Life were going to release the complete saga in one set, with loads of extras and new interviews. My delight was short-lived when I discovered that the set would only be available in the USA, but I wasn't going to let that fact beat me. I think the set is only available until October 2011, and I'm pleased to say that I managed to aquire a set from the USA (and paid way over the odds but I don't damn care!!) and took delivery today...YIPEE!!

The set is beautifully presented, and the quality of the region 1 DVD's are great. The accompanying notes with each set are comprehensive and well written. It'll be my luck that they'll go and release it here in the UK now!!

The show was my absolute favourite when I was growing up. After my weekly instalment, I'd jump off the stairs, off my bed, off the sofa, thinking I was the bionic man and I'd lift up things that were as light as a feather, making believe that they were so heavy. I'd also make the sound efffect noises when I lifted a heavy object, or threw something through the air, as well as the sound of Steve's bionic eye in close-up mode...sad eh? But who cares!

My favourite episodes were the ones involving bigfoot, Jaimie Sommers, the robots, and the space related episodes. If you love this show as much as I do and you are in the UK, then I'd advise you get it before it's too late - god knows how long a release will be here.....

My advice to all SMDM fans-Head over to time life.com and save 160.04. Plus, Time life has free shipping on this item.

I only saw the first season as I purchased it as a stand alone set. It is my understanding that Time life is planning on releasing all 5 seasons indulvidually.

I can only commet on the first season. The first season was a mid-season replacement of another show that was canceled. That is why there are only 13 episodes. In addition-the first season has 3 pilot movies made prior of being picked up as a series.

I will update this review when I view the whole series.

I finished watching all of the DVDs of this series-and I can say that it has lived up to my expectations and then some. All 5 seasons come uncut. It contains almost all of the crossover episodes of the Binonic woman. The first 3 seasons were the best, the 4th season was really good too-but it was showing it's weakness with a couple of less than steller episodes.

The best is the ""Kill Oscar"" episodes. There is one thing I don't understand: It's one thing for one part of an episode to be in one show and conclude in another-but it's quite another to start a 3 part episode in one show-then part two airing in the other show and then conclude it back in the other show as with the case with ""Kill Oscar"" It's easy for us who have the DVDs-but about when it aired on TV? It is so confusing.

The 5th season started out strong with two two parters. I also liked the ""Return of death probe"" epiodes and ""Date with Danger"" but the show was losing steam with the weak 2-hour episode ""The lost Island"" and the final episode ""THe moving mountain"" It would be the last season.

It doesn't end there. The complete series has a bonus 5 disc set. The first 3 are the 3 reunion movies and the 2 part syndication versions of the 3 pilot movies-with extra footage. The first two reunion movies were pretty good-but the last one ""Bionic ever after?"" is the weak one, though  I felt Steve and Jamie finally getting married was a nice touch and brought closure to the series. The last two discs are interviews, featurettes and ect-Including a very long ""OSI debreifing"" segment with Lee Majors.

Overall a deeply satifying set and worth every dollar.",1313452800,7,2310,4.5047846889952154
4336127,1,B004E83KVU,"I would buy a season every few months if the series were offered by season, but I refuse to pay one lump sum of $300.00 for this set. The show is great, but I'll spend my money on something else.",1313452800,6,195,3.9
4336128,5,B004E83KVU,"Those of you who want to buy this item just need to have a little patience. This DVD set is available at another site for about $225.00. This site also had Get Smart TV Series for about the same price...that was the only place to get them!! In time however, Get Smart became available at Amazon and other retail outlets!! I bought Get Smart for about $115.00... a savings of over $100.00. Long story short...if I had waited a little longer...On Amazon when I last checked had Get Smart for about $86.00. The same thing is going to happen with The Six Millon Dollar Men... just need to have a little patience and wait for the price to be more reasonable.",1313020800,4,653,4.404958677685951
4336129,5,B004E83KVU,"Well, it really sums it up, doesn't it? Like many others, I grew up watching the series in the '70s, and I was waiting so long to get to see Steve Austin again on my DVD... the Complete Collection exceeded my expectations, as it contained everything that I saw, and I didn't see, all episodes and bonus features, TV movies and pilots... in summary, all there is to enjoy the show with the background work!
I couldn't have wished for anything better, from the packaging to the contents. I recommend this as a must-have to all SixMill$ fans!",1308182400,5,539,4.510204081632653
4336130,5,B004E83KVU,"To me I have been waiting for this show for a long time to come out to region 1 and not to the rest of the world. I saw it on Tv for timelife. That is a better idea for a price, Now we have Bionic women season 1,and 2 out that is great. Sure the Season 2 is not so great in two episodes but when will they bring it back out again for Bionic women.
The 6 million dollar man is great and cant wait to see all of it again. Good luck to who ever gets the whole set,",1307059200,,461,3.5294117647058822
4336131,1,B004E83KVU,"I gave this 1 star not because of the show's quality, which I grew up watching this show and would LOVE to have it on DVD, but not at these prices!  Hence the 1 star rating.  If I had 3-400.00 I'd probably buy the entire series as they have packaged it here, but...I don't...so...I can't.  Besides, I love buying one season at a time because it gives me something to look forward to each time a season is released.  So...why hell can't these be released one season at a time, eh?
They're releasing Bionic Woman that way. I see the price this entire series set is going for and I just go into frustrated mode.
Stop toying with people's wallets and bank accounts and make it easier for us.  Would you please?",1305417600,12,706,4.318181818181818
4336132,1,B004E83KVU,"OK, I LOVE the ""Six Million Dollar Man"".  Have loved it ever since I was a kid, but the price is simply robbery.  When classic TV shows like this come out, I really want everyone to buy them legally, but this price is such a slap in the face, I have no sympathy for the company.  I hope no one buys this until it come out at a reasonable price, and frankly there should be punitive damages for such a show of pure greed.  In the meantime, the Bionic Woman is coming out at reasonable prices.  Buy that for now, and hope there is some Karma for this company.",1305417600,12,557,4.073394495412844
4336133,5,B004E83KVU,The restored DVDs look great. It's about time they gave Steve Austin the royal treatment. This is a great set but not for 449. Do an Internet search (because I don't want to advertise for anyone here) and get it elsewhere for about two hundred less.,1305331200,5,249,4.434782608695652
4336134,5,B004E83KVU,"Glad to see that legal issues were settled so that this TV classic could finally be released to us in the US and Canada. Alot of great bonus features. Just wish that the old ABC promos and Kenner toy commercials would've been included. Sounds corny, but this is like running into old friends you haven't seen in years. They don't make TV shows like this anymore. Now if one of the toy companies would revive the toyline. How 'bout it, Hasbro? Maybe Steve Austin can join the GI Joe team. They could use an astronaut/test pilot with great strength.",1304294400,6,547,4.5353535353535355
4336135,5,B004E83KVU,I used to watch this as a youngster every week and became instantly hooked and now that I own this magnificent collection on dvd I'm reliving those days over again. This really is a fantastic set with perfect picture quality and great bonus features and without doubt my favourite tv show of all time. I can recommend this to anyone who's a fan of The Six Million Dollar Man. I'm not disappointed with the set and neither will anybody else be.,1304208000,8,443,4.481481481481482
4336136,5,B004E83KVU,Instead of just releasing season sets every 3 or 4 years - just release the entire series all at once! I'm going to be 80 before I get the entire series of some of these other great classic shows. Ridiculous.,1303689600,6,208,4.225
4336137,5,B004E83KVU,"I grew up watching The Six Million Dollar Man and had given up on ever seeing it on DVD then last year Time-Life released the enire series in one awesome set.  The series looks great, the sound is pretty good and the special features are great.  I ordered mine through Time-Life after I found an online coupon for 10% off (plus $12 back from ebates, bringing the price to just over $200).  The set is well worth the price Time-Life is asking and they did a great job with every aspect of bringing one the best shows from the 70's to DVD but there is no need to pay this much.  I don't know why this seller is asking $500 for something that can be purchased for less than half that from the people that produced the set.",1303257600,61,719,4.188405797101449
4336138,5,B004E83KVU,"I admit to being hesitant on purchasing this when it was released in the fall of 2010 due to the cost, but I can honestly say it was worth every penny.  Time-Life has given ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" fans the greatest respect by packing these DVDs with extras, including the cross-over episodes of ""The Bionic Woman"", the original pilot movies, and the reunion films.  It took hours just to go through the bonus discs of interviews and mini-documentaries.  The Big Foot episodes are still every bit as awesome as they were in the 70's, but the three part FEMBOT episode is by far one of the greatest moments in television history.  Aside from being continuously awed by the packaging, the episodes are great classic fun.  Time-Life has this the cheapest and they even have a payment plan!  You will not be disappointed by this fantastic box set!",1302652800,3,847,4.6891891891891895
4336139,5,B004E83KVU,"This is an amazing mega set. This is the way to do it. If you're a fan you have to get this. The best way is to buy it from Time Life, you get the best price there. You won't be disappointed.",1300838400,,191,3.5714285714285716
4336140,5,B004E83KVU,"This is a great product and I would endorse it completely. Don't pay over $239.00 for it though. This series has been officially released through Time Life Video and they are selling it for $239.00 brand new. I love Amazon and buy almost all my dvd 's through here. There is no need to pay $279.00 for it though or more than that for used. Why would anyone pay more for used dvd than to get it brand new? It is ridiculous. Definately buy dvd through Amazon but don't get rooked from some sellers. Wait a few months and the prices will go down. This is one of my favorite shows and I have owned season 1 and 2 from on region 2 format for a while now and season 3-5 from other sources. I can wait so I am not taken advantage of. It is about time that the stubborn Universal has finally decided to release this stuff before its forgotten completely. The Bionic Woman season 1 and 2 has also been finally released. I've owned the region 2 releases of all 3 season for a while also.
They waited so long that they are lucky people are even buying them.",1300838400,3,1046,4.183168316831683
4336141,5,B004E83KVU,"Took a chance and bought a used copy (1/2 retail from Time Life website); I couldn't be more pleased. Box and DVDs arrived in perfect condition. As soon as I opened it, I had a big smile. This series was long awaited but the release is top notch. Every Bionic Man tv appearance is here and the box has the iconic red jumpsuit hologram + a chip giving Oscar Goldman's voiceover. This was one of my favorite shows and watching season 1 takes me back to a happy place. Since there's 80+ hrs to consume, I'll be viewing for awhile.

If you are a fan, order this set and you'll love it.",1300665600,30,581,4.1875
4336142,5,B004E83KVU,"This whole series is now finally available. The quality is excellent and it comes complete with a nice collector's box. Be warned that according to the 6mdm.com website it's only going to be available until October 2011, so get it now before it's gone. Also, take note that it can be purchased for $40 less than offered here with free shipping at the website mentioned.",1300579200,5,369,4.6923076923076925

You can purchase this from the Time Life TV show web page for $100 or purchase the individual 5 seasons from Amazon for $10 or less. I do own this set and it is a very cool package stored in a box that plays the show's theme music when opened and there is a set of bonus discs with all of the TV reunion movies and the 3 pilot movies as they were shown in edited form in syndication. I guess it all depends on how bad you want the bonus discs. I recommend that nobody pays $115 to $165 more than you have to. That said, I did pay $150 for my set a year and half ago and I felt it was worth it. I love my set!",1441756800,,709,3.7651006711409396
