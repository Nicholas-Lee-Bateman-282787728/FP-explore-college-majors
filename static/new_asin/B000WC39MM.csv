2965971,3,B000WC39MM,"So I am not a picky person by nature when it comes to movies and television shows. I personally like this movie for the references to both West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet along with the fact that its a cute little movie. I wouldn't say this movie is cinematic genius by any means but its a good simple time waster movie. There are many better movies, even within this series but if you are looking for a cute movie than give it a shot. I will add that this movie can be quite hard to find and I occasionally get the urge to watch it so I'm glad that I have it for that occasion once a year or so that I don't have to go attempt to hunt it down.",1430697600,,649,3.887218045112782

2966011,1,B000WC39MM,"The original movie ""Bring it On"" is well directed, as well as having good actors whose cheerleading is phenomenal. It also has an fairly good plot and very good dialog. All the following sequels have none of the above. Poorly directed, the acting is terrible and the script may have been written by a fourth grade class who was joking. Nothing like the original.",1423785600,,362,4.671875
2966012,4,B000WC39MM,"My 13 and 10 year old daughters tell me this movie was great. Now that's their opinion. I think they probably could have been watching something a little less stereotypical, but our selection was limited that day.  There is some adult content, and some bad language. But since I watched the first couple of movies from the franchise I knew what was coming. These movies are typically all the same. The stereotypical characters: jock, dumb blond, are not who they seem in the end. When watched from start to finish it is entertaining and funny. My 13 year old said she thinks 10 would be the limit, but I have to say it really depends on your child and your maturity level. This movie is very typical ""sports, dance competition movie.""",1423526400,,734,4.603053435114504

2966116,5,B000WC39MM,"Though it is NOT award worthy, I bought it for my daughter's birthday. She loves all the Bring it On's and this is the only one we didn't have. Its a typical cliche filled young teen movie. I love it because its a ""Teen movie"" but definitely G rated! My daughter just turned 11 so she considers it a ""big girl"" movie, I know that she can watch it and feel comfortable with it. If your into cheesy, over the top, cliche filled movies, this is the one you want. Truth be told, I love sitting with my girls and watching it and see how happy they are copying the moves or ""pretending"" to be the sharks and the jets!",1347753600,,611,4.1

2966146,5,B000WC39MM,"This is a great movie. I like the way it shows the importance of working together as a team so that both chearleading tems can compete as one to win. It also shows the importance of beliving in yourself and not in luck or curses if you want to accomplish something.
 Which is what Carson has to learn to trust herself and that she is good enough and that curse or no curse if she does her best she is good enough to win. The jets and shark have to play of each others streangths to off set each others weaknesses. They have to learn to get along and let the differences go if they want to win. I recommand this movie to anyone. Especially if you liked any of the other bring it on movies. They are all good. If all of the i like this one the best.
Another one you may loike that falls in this catagory is
 Man of the House ~ Tommy Lee Jones, Cedric the Entertainer, and Christina Milian (DVD - 2005). Another Movie i highly recomend it is funny.",1217721600,6,945,4.075268817204301
2966147,4,B000WC39MM,"Starting off I'm going to tell you that IV seen every bring it one movie that could possibly be.  I am writing about the forth bring it on movie (in it to win it) this movie is about there schools team who go to cheer camp four the summer. There are many different teams that go to this camp. The two teams that that bring most of the computation are the sharks and the jets those two teams HATE each other and they will do any thing to win the sprit stick. that mean if a shark/jet  talks to one another it is going to be trash talk....but what if they don't know that their talking to a shark/jet let a lone kiss ,date,. Fall in love with one another. This movie is fun four all teen who love a lot of drama, except me I was sad when I watched movie it because I could tell what was going to happen next...THEIR ALL THE SAME!!! But the though of seeing
Just one moor bring it one would not be that bad. I would still like them keep making the BRING IT ON'S but I would like them to make a different plot every now and then and not keep repeating the story.
If you're a bring it on fan then don't stop watching the third bring it on
And go and see the forth (in it to win it) this movie it is great.",1208217600,,1200,3.8938775510204082
2966148,1,B000WC39MM,I own (now) all 4 of the Bring it on movies and I have to say that this one is the worst one of them all!!!!  I'm lucky  I won it free on a website instead of wasting my money buying it.,1203379200,,186,3.4047619047619047
2966179,1,B000WC39MM,"Okay, so many of you who are going to see this movie will have no idea that it is a ripoff of a far superior movie musical, ""West Side Story.""  Yes, the Jets and the Sharks, which are rival gangs in West Side Story, are now rival cheerleading teams.  And there is even a romantic triangle between the Jets and the Sharks.  But, this is as close to a good movie as the fourth ""Bring it on"" movie gets.  The dialogue in this series of movies has gone from bad to awful.  And then, there's the rivalry between the two cheerleading teams.  You would think that the finale of the movie would involve the Jets and Sharks fighting for a cheerleading title.  But, no... instead, well... you be the judge whether the ending was a good idea.  Having an antagonist at the end of the movie who you rarely see until that point kind of made the ending anti-climactic.

Now, the bits about the curse of the cheer stick were at times funny, all the characters are nice to look at, but the film was all fluff, no substance.  Skip this one!",1202515200,7,1022,4.276041666666667
2966180,4,B000WC39MM,The movie was a great sequel.  My daughter and her friends thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a good movie for teenage girls.,1202515200,,120,4.409090909090909
2966181,4,B000WC39MM,"It's deliciously campy. From climbing on mailboxes, to massive ""impromptu""  cheer offs, to the whole ""My parents will never understand my cheering!"". Don't expect to be moved by massive hugfests or tearfests, if you go in ready to laugh at some of the most ridiculous lines you've heard, ""J-E-T-S, Jets rule from east to west"" at lunch tables or to be amazing by stunts and gymnastics they pull then this is for you. Overall, while I wouldn't buy this movie, I can definitely see a massive cheer montage on youtube of this and this would be a great Friday night girls-in movie.

General Notes
The whole dumb girl and mean girl relation is getting really old.
What is with the rat tail? No one does that.
Finally, don't expect to be remotely moved by any character or inspired, but expect to laugh, and that's what you'll get through this movie.
Enjoy!",1200787200,2,851,4.629139072847682
2966182,4,B000WC39MM,This movie was good but not as good as the first one.  The stunts were ok but nothing that you don't see here in your local cheer gym. I think that most teenagers will enjoy this movie.,1200700800,,185,4.0
2966183,3,B000WC39MM,"I purchased this movie for my middle school daughter who loves cheerleading.  Although the movie had a great overall theme about the importance of being able to set aside differences and work together to accomplish a goal, the language in the movie was terrible!  There was a lot of name calling and strong foul language.  The movie would have been an A+ with all of the great dance routines and cheer moves, had they not included the use of horrendous words.",1200528000,,459,4.6419753086419755

2966185,5,B000WC39MM,"I like this movie. It is simply fantastic. It is because it shows the importance of the cheerleader teamwork. In this movie, it is all funny and exciting from start to finish. This is the best ""Bring it On"" so far because the cast is very good. For the acting, it is just as perfect as before with no doubt. For the visual, it is good because it really shows the true cooperation with team member during this movie. Overall, it is simply a good movie.",1199059200,2,451,4.255813953488372

2966187,3,B000WC39MM,"""Bring It On: In It To Win It"" is the fourth of these competitive cheerleader flicks to come down the pike in the past seven years, and either it is going to be the last or somebody is going to make it their personal mission in life to make sure the franchise finds a better end than this 2007 direct to video offering.  One thing for sure: each of these films makes the original look better, and every time they try to come up with another cheer routine laden with irony and caustic wit it always pales in comparison with the opening bit of the original ""Bring It On.""  Since it is assumed that you are checking out this movie because you liked the original (and perhaps one or more of the others in the series), such comparisons are inevitable as is the inevitable judgment that this is an inferior product.

You know that the end of the movie is going to be the big competition, so the goal is to set up as much conflict before the inevitable final battle before the cheering crowds and other competitors.  That would be the Sharks, the red dressed team from the left coast captained by Carson (Ashley Benson), versus the Jets, the East Coast team decked out in blue led by Brooke (Cassie Scerbo).  The Jets finished first and the Sharks second at the previous championship, so the groups hate each other.  As you might suspect from their team names, the two teams end up facing off on the street, throwing around as much attitude and twists as they can before learning there is a reason cheerleaders do their routines on padded mats.  With half of each team out of commission, Carson and Brooke have to find a way to work together or they are not going to go out as winners.  There are additional layers of complications because Carson is smitten with Penn (Michael Copon), who, of course, is a Jet (I bet somebody out there is going to YouTube a montage of Carson and Penn to ""A Boy Like That"" from ""West Side Story""; actually, most any song from that musical could be played against scenes from this film).  If that is not enough adolescent angst, Penn has been lying to his parents about where he is spending his summer.

Then there is the curse of the spirit stick.

I round up on ""Bring It On: In It To Win It"" because when we finally get to the last act you get to see some competitive cheerleading routines, and since these are actual human beings doing all of this stuff I am always impressed.  I know next to nothing about such cheerleading competitions, but like many of us I can fall back on the idea ""I could never do that in a million years"" and be allowed a small measure of awe.  A lot of what is in this film is more miss than hit: for example, the semi-Goth cheerleader has her moments but the idea that not one but two of her teammates would confess to putting up fronts to be their particular stereotypes strikes me as too much.  But that is to be expected from a franchise that is now at the point where the name of the game is to count things off by the numbers, from the nightmare cheerleading sequences at the start to the cast lip-synching to a song during the closing credits.  Lower your expectations going in to this one and you will have a better chance of coming out ahead.",1198281600,15,3206,4.346733668341709

I wouldn't say this movie is cinematic genius by any means but its a good simple time waster movie. There are many better movies, even within this series but if you are looking for a cute movie than give it a shot. I will add that this movie can be quite hard to find and I occasionally get the urge to watch it so I'm glad that I have it for that occasion once a year or so that I don't have to go attempt to hunt it down.",1430697600,,649,3.887218045112782

I think they probably could have been watching something a little less stereotypical, but our selection was limited that day.  There is some adult content, and some bad language. But since I watched the first couple of movies from the franchise I knew what was coming. These movies are typically all the same. The stereotypical characters: jock, dumb blond, are not who they seem in the end. When watched from start to finish it is entertaining and funny. My 13 year old said she thinks 10 would be the limit, but I have to say it really depends on your child and your maturity level. This movie is very typical ""sports, dance competition movie.""",1423526400,,734,4.603053435114504

3200643,5,B000WC39MM,"This is a great movie. I like the way it shows the importance of working together as a team so that both chearleading tems can compete as one to win. It also shows the importance of beliving in yourself and not in luck or curses if you want to accomplish something.
 Which is what Carson has to learn to trust herself and that she is good enough and that curse or no curse if she does her best she is good enough to win. The jets and shark have to play of each others streangths to off set each others weaknesses. They have to learn to get along and let the differences go if they want to win. I recommand this movie to anyone. Especially if you liked any of the other bring it on movies. They are all good. If all of the i like this one the best.
Another one you may loike that falls in this catagory is
 Man of the House ~ Tommy Lee Jones, Cedric the Entertainer, and Christina Milian (DVD - 2005). Another Movie i highly recomend it is funny.",1217721600,6,945,4.075268817204301

I am writing about the forth bring it on movie (in it to win it) this movie is about there schools team who go to cheer camp four the summer. There are many different teams that go to this camp. The two teams that that bring most of the computation are the sharks and the jets those two teams HATE each other and they will do any thing to win the sprit stick. that mean if a shark/jet  talks to one another it is going to be trash talk....but what if they don't know that their talking to a shark/jet let a lone kiss ,date,. Fall in love with one another. This movie is fun four all teen who love a lot of drama, except me I was sad when I watched movie it because I could tell what was going to happen next...THEIR ALL THE SAME!!! But the though of seeing
Just one moor bring it one would not be that bad. I would still like them keep making the BRING IT ON'S but I would like them to make a different plot every now and then and not keep repeating the story.
If you're a bring it on fan then don't stop watching the third bring it on

3200676,1,B000WC39MM,"Okay, so many of you who are going to see this movie will have no idea that it is a ripoff of a far superior movie musical, ""West Side Story.""  Yes, the Jets and the Sharks, which are rival gangs in West Side Story, are now rival cheerleading teams.  And there is even a romantic triangle between the Jets and the Sharks.  But, this is as close to a good movie as the fourth ""Bring it on"" movie gets.  The dialogue in this series of movies has gone from bad to awful.  And then, there's the rivalry between the two cheerleading teams.  You would think that the finale of the movie would involve the Jets and Sharks fighting for a cheerleading title.  But, no... instead, well... you be the judge whether the ending was a good idea.  Having an antagonist at the end of the movie who you rarely see until that point kind of made the ending anti-climactic.

Now, the bits about the curse of the cheer stick were at times funny, all the characters are nice to look at, but the film was all fluff, no substance.  Skip this one!",1202515200,7,1022,4.276041666666667

3200678,4,B000WC39MM,"It's deliciously campy. From climbing on mailboxes, to massive ""impromptu""  cheer offs, to the whole ""My parents will never understand my cheering!"". Don't expect to be moved by massive hugfests or tearfests, if you go in ready to laugh at some of the most ridiculous lines you've heard, ""J-E-T-S, Jets rule from east to west"" at lunch tables or to be amazing by stunts and gymnastics they pull then this is for you. Overall, while I wouldn't buy this movie, I can definitely see a massive cheer montage on youtube of this and this would be a great Friday night girls-in movie.

General Notes
The whole dumb girl and mean girl relation is getting really old.
What is with the rat tail? No one does that.
Finally, don't expect to be remotely moved by any character or inspired, but expect to laugh, and that's what you'll get through this movie.

3200684,3,B000WC39MM,"""Bring It On: In It To Win It"" is the fourth of these competitive cheerleader flicks to come down the pike in the past seven years, and either it is going to be the last or somebody is going to make it their personal mission in life to make sure the franchise finds a better end than this 2007 direct to video offering.  One thing for sure: each of these films makes the original look better, and every time they try to come up with another cheer routine laden with irony and caustic wit it always pales in comparison with the opening bit of the original ""Bring It On.""  Since it is assumed that you are checking out this movie because you liked the original (and perhaps one or more of the others in the series), such comparisons are inevitable as is the inevitable judgment that this is an inferior product.

You know that the end of the movie is going to be the big competition, so the goal is to set up as much conflict before the inevitable final battle before the cheering crowds and other competitors.  That would be the Sharks, the red dressed team from the left coast captained by Carson (Ashley Benson), versus the Jets, the East Coast team decked out in blue led by Brooke (Cassie Scerbo).  The Jets finished first and the Sharks second at the previous championship, so the groups hate each other.  As you might suspect from their team names, the two teams end up facing off on the street, throwing around as much attitude and twists as they can before learning there is a reason cheerleaders do their routines on padded mats.  With half of each team out of commission, Carson and Brooke have to find a way to work together or they are not going to go out as winners.  There are additional layers of complications because Carson is smitten with Penn (Michael Copon), who, of course, is a Jet (I bet somebody out there is going to YouTube a montage of Carson and Penn to ""A Boy Like That"" from ""West Side Story""; actually, most any song from that musical could be played against scenes from this film).  If that is not enough adolescent angst, Penn has been lying to his parents about where he is spending his summer.

Then there is the curse of the spirit stick.

I round up on ""Bring It On: In It To Win It"" because when we finally get to the last act you get to see some competitive cheerleading routines, and since these are actual human beings doing all of this stuff I am always impressed.  I know next to nothing about such cheerleading competitions, but like many of us I can fall back on the idea ""I could never do that in a million years"" and be allowed a small measure of awe.  A lot of what is in this film is more miss than hit: for example, the semi-Goth cheerleader has her moments but the idea that not one but two of her teammates would confess to putting up fronts to be their particular stereotypes strikes me as too much.  But that is to be expected from a franchise that is now at the point where the name of the game is to count things off by the numbers, from the nightmare cheerleading sequences at the start to the cast lip-synching to a song during the closing credits.  Lower your expectations going in to this one and you will have a better chance of coming out ahead.",1198281600,15,3206,4.346733668341709

8222364,4,B000WC39MM,"Released to video in 2007 and directed by Steve Rash, Bring it On: In it to Win it is a high school dramedy/sports flick starring Ashley Benson and Cassandra Scerbo as Carson and Brooke, the captains of two rival cheerleading teams, the West Coast Sharks and the East Coast Jets respectively. They meet at Camp Spirit-Thunder in Florida for the championship, but Carsons romance with a male cheerleader of the Jets (Michael Copon) throws a wrench into the proceedings. Everything falls apart when the rival squads engage in a cheer-rumble where half their teammates sustain injuries that remove both the Sharks and the Jets from competition. What will they do?

In it to Win it is the fourth movie in the franchise. The others are Bring it On (2000), Bring it On Again (2004), Bring it On: All or Nothing (2006) and Bring it On: Fight to the Finish (2009). The first movie was the only one that was theatrically released and is therefore the most polished in the series as far as overall production quality. This perhaps explains why I couldn't get past the 50-minute mark of In it to Win it the first time I tried to watch it, but I decided to give it another chance and am glad I did because the first half is just a build-up to the nigh genius of the second half. While the first half is kinetic fun, it lacks dramatic depth and therefore becomes a bore by the mid-point, but the second half fleshes out the great characters and everything clicks for an amusing high school dramedy/ sports flick.

What distinguishes In it to Win it is that the entire movie takes place at the national cheer camp, which is parallel to a huge amusement park; as such, there are no high school sequences. In the first half youll role your eyes at the stereotypes, but the second half pulls the rug out from underneath your presumptions with a great confession sequence. Highlights include the semi-homage to the renowned West Side Story, the great cast, the smart amusement, the energetic tone and some amazing cheer routines, not to mention Ashley Tisdales hit song during the credits. In it to Win it also has better women than the first movie, although not as good as All or Nothing (featuring Hayden Panettiere and Danielle Savre).

Speaking of the great cast, they're essentially no-names, but they deliver the goods as a nice assortment of characters that you come to understand and like over the course of the story. Beyond the cast noted above, the top ones are Noel Areizaga (the gay Shark), Jennifer Tisdale (curvy white Jet), Kierstin Koppel (the Goth Shark) and Anniese Taylor Dendy (black shark with seemingly ghetto edge).

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios Florida, Universal Orlando Resort.
