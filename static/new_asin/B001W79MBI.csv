For starters...WOW! What a movie,simply amazing,instant classic.

I am an avid anime viewer and I have been so for quite some time,so I have gone through a lot of anime, some that made me want to rip my hair out and some that have reminded me time and time again why I love anime so much. Although I like many different kinds of anime I tend to refrain from shonen-styled(with the exception of Black Cat)anime and go for more adult themed anime such as Paranoia Agent,Berserk,Gungrave,etc.

As mentioned in previous reviews the animation is top knotch. You have to see it for yourself, the detail put into this movie was incredible. It looks even more crisp and vibrant on blu ray. The scenery was simply breathtaking. Beautifully hand-drawn and NO CGI!!!

The story is one that mixes many elements. So perfectly balanced. It made me sad,it made me happy,it made me laugh, and altogether left me speechless. The action was fast paced and perfectly executed, not to mention bloody. Sudio bones is by far one of my favorite studios and they did not disappoint! The music complemented the movie flawlessly. Between the beautiful animation and great music I must have experienced chills several times throughout.

I'd hate to say this, but many animes tend to disappoint as far as endings go. Well, this one doesn't, in fact the climax/ending is the best part. Such gripping action and so passionate.

All-in-all this is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. I recommend it to anime fans and even new-comers alike.

Buy it and enjoy! A+++++++ 5/5",1245283200,,1641,4.716783216783217
3824127,4,B001W79MBI,"I have always had a fondness for anime that explored the Bushido period; noteworthy hits such as the anime series ""Basilisk"" and the anime film ""Ninja Scroll"" have garnered a powerful following. Most recently the almost Okamoto/Kobayashi inspired ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" has left me in awe. Director Masahiro Ando with screenplay by Fumihiko Takayama has adapted a tale from the original story by ""Bones"". ""SWORD OF THE STRANGER"" (aka. Sutorenjia Muko Hadan) is an animated film with fantastic action that uses the Sengoku period (a period of warring states) as its backdrop. It is a story of faith, ambition and survival.

The film was a nominee for Best animated Feature at the 81st Academy of film awards.

A young boy named Kotaro (voiced by Yuri Chinen) and his dog are wandering the lands of Japan; fleeing the Ming forces led by Lord Bai-Luan. They come across a nameless Ronin (Nanashi, voiced by Tomoya Nagase) who is haunted by the memories of his past and who has vowed to keep his blade sheathed. Chinese mercenaries are dispatched to claim the small boy for a twisted ritual for immortality. Seeing the remnants of his past within the boy, the nameless samurai chooses to act as his protector but does he have the necessary skills to keep him from the clutches of the Ming and their blood thirsty, gold-haired swordsman named Luo-Lang (Kouichi Yamadera)?

The film uses this chaotic period in feudal Japan; the Sengoku period or the era of the Warring States is a period after the decline of the second shogun. The film ponders the question: What makes a man good or evil? Is it the corruption of the amount of political power or the ambition to rise to such powers? Is it the skill of swordsmanship or the manner he serves his Lord? ""Sword of the Stranger"" does flesh out these questions in the spirit of its characters. Itadori is a general whose skills as a swordsman allowed him to rise above the ranks. He is ambitious and power hungry and he serves a corrupt feudal lord in the persona of Akaike; who in turn is driven by greed and lust for more power. Bai-Luan is an aide to the Emperor and seeks immortality to prolong his dwindling life. Luo-Lang is a warrior who serves the Ming Emperor but he is flawed in a way that he is longing for a worthy opponent. He is loyal, but only as that loyalty serves him. The nameless swordsman is a man exhausted, he has killed and served his Lord in the past--such actions have made his soul empty. He has tied a knot on his sword to keep him from drawing his blade, but his skills are good enough to fell highly trained opponents.

The film captures certain interpretations of the evils that men would do, for ambition, greed and loyalty. Kotaro represents the innocence and purity of youth, and as such he is the key to the Xian drug, believed to be the key to immortality. Kotaro's dog, Tobimaru also plays a significant role in the film, as he proves to be the catalyst for Nanashi and Kotaro's allegiance. The film has some touching and humorous moments, as we see the dog practice generosity and sacrifice. After all, if an animal can learn compassion, why can't us human beings? The nameless swordsman's past in shown in the form of dreams and flashbacks. (Also, there is a short film in the DVD's features that further develops his character)

 It is easy to ignore the film's subtle meanings, as the film does have amazing action sequences that rival Ryuhei Kitamura's ""AZUMI"". The action scenes contain a good amount of gore and loads of blood. But not too bloody that the film should be rated `R'. I loved the way Nanashi defends himself without even drawing his sword, it is a true testament to his skills which provokes Luo-Lang's obsession in facing him in single combat. The fights are long, stylish and brutally violent at times. Chinese Wuxia meets Japanese swordsmanship in the encounters. I liked the manner in which Luo-Lang and Nanashi were developed through their separate fights, it allows them to be further developed and allows for build-up in the inevitable final encounter. One flaw the film has is that Kotaro's past wasn't fully fleshed out and the reasons for him being special weren't really fully explored.

The action is well animated and the moves are fluid and soft. The set designs have that minor touch of CGI, and the backgrounds almost look very photo-realistic. The mood is cleverly expressed through its effects in the form of blowing wind, ominous snowfall and the darkening of clouds. The character designs may look simple and may not be as elaborate as other anime films of this kind, but it was still pretty good. The music track perfectly complements the film's mood and attitude; I found the music quite rousing in its own right.

""Sword of the Stranger"" is one good piece of animated feature. I am still rather impressed how the Japanese can keep adult themes in the form of animation, whereas here in the U.S. animation is often associated with ""kiddie-flicks"". The film is full of very cool action, violence that pushes the PG-13 envelope with a strong humanity that can let the film stand on its own. The viewer has to look beyond the action otherwise; he may lose some of the subtle details and may make him think the plot is a little contrived. It may not approach the classic status of other acclaimed anime hits but it is entertaining enough to keep the experienced anime fan enthralled and to attract those unfamiliar with Japanimation.

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]

Video/Audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Nice, clean transfer with some muted colors on some scenes. The 5.1 Japanese Language track is powerful and clear with excellent Subtitles. There is also the option of an English Language 5.1 track.
Extras: Pretty bare bones, there are trailers and commercials but the pilot film called ""Muko Hadan"" is worth a look. There are also character interviews.",1245196800,32,5884,4.754162585700294

3824129,5,B001W79MBI,"It has been a while since I watched an anime this filling. Definitely worth purchasing to add to your movie collection. The fights in this movie make Samurai Champloo look dull. After being a little disappointed with ""The Skycrawlers"" this felt like a breath of fresh air. Good English dub too. If I had the TV/Blu-Ray player I bet this movie would be amazing in Blu-Ray. If you are a fan of animation you would be stupid to look this movie over.

3824130,5,B001W79MBI,"I was given this movie to watch and I must say, I was quite pleased with everything about this movie.  The hand drawn art work was beautifully done as well as the fleshed out characters.

It's some times hard to find good anime with a good story line that isn't just a bunch of random fight scenes thrown in to try and keep it interesting - this one had a story.  The development between the two main characters follows along perfectly with the story.  You can see each character come into their own.

The movie it self, very well done.  I watched the Japanese version and the being I'm a animae snob and only watch them with subtitles, this one was done just right.  The text didn't fly from the screen as soon as it was said and gave the viewer enough to read what was happening and watch what else was happening.

I'll purchase the one coming out this month and hope that it's the same style editing and subtitle style.",1244505600,5,922,4.319767441860465
3824131,5,B001W79MBI,"OK, the story line here is maybe just a B or B+ protection/revenge kind of thing. But I went with a 10-year-old Studio Ghibli fan, and we both ended up liking this a lot. It's simply really well done in the action and visuals department. I think it will be considered a lesser known classic.",1244419200,2,291,4.3090909090909095

Right after seeing the movie We went out and got the Japanese verison with the english subtitles. I'm really looking forward to the english version due to the voice actors, and slight changes in the script. The action scenes are fast paced and very detailed. I hope someone is making the weapons used in this movie, cause i would love to collect a few chosen worrors weapons. The way these worrors handle there weapons as well as the way they move are well beautifuly put together. The story line is solid, with a few jokes from time to time. All and All I say if your an Anime Junkie like myself, and love to see a great story line, with some seriously mind blowling acton scenes. Then i suggest this movie.",1240272000,7,841,4.3630573248407645
3824133,5,B001W79MBI,"This movie made a one day appearance at the theaters and thanks to a killer trailer I made a point of not missing it. Despite the movie being relatively new, there's a strange nostalgia I felt while watching it. For one, most or all of the art is hand drawn. On the big screen, the line quality is very noticeable, especially since the past decade most animation has been exempt from any line quality at all en lieu of 3D. So seeing the hand of the artist in motion was a feeling I had missed from the old days of watching Charlie Brown :-) How I manage to put Charlie Brown and a Master Samurai in the same sentence...I don't know.

But anyway...

The other thing that grabbed me was that this movie actually spends time developing both story and its characters, and it does an incredible job at that. Granted, the plot itself is a bit cliche: The bad guys are after an immortality potion that requires a young boy, Kotaro, to be sacrificed in order for the potion to work. But the cliche is padded with a strong historical back drop that gives the story a surprising gritty realism. While so many movies chop away at a good story and evolving character elements, this one slows down just enough to make you actually care about the fate of the Nameless Samurai, Kotaro and even his dog.

The steady pacing was a good way to build up to an ending so loaded with tension that I could actually feel my muscles locked up. As the Nameless character does battle with his enemies, you can't help but to feel that he may be in way over his head. In a lot of way, the movie reminded me of ""Ninja Scroll"": there are a host of foes that the Nameless Saurai must confront and you'll have your doubts about his skills being matched to each one. Such doubts are the hallmark of a gripping story.",1240185600,74,1782,4.3293413173652695

3824156,5,B001W79MBI,"It is a very simple concept just done well. SO often you seee movies and think ""man how did they mess that up?"" This is a perfectly good example of just the opposite. They took a simple idea and crafted a solid enough story around it with characters that were meaningful enough to be entertaining. It was lacking a bit of context for the characters, but again it offered enough where I honestly did not really think about it until I had to find something of which to be critical.

The animation is absolutely superb, the soundtrack and voice acting are fantastic. It boasts some incredible fight scenes, and is violent but not overly gratuitous or graphic as compared to some others. Though when I read it was submitted for an academy award and not nominated I fully understood considering the depictions of violence...which let me be clear I love.

I thought it was a unique blend of Chinese vs Japanese philosophies as it related to martial arts and the court. There were good moments of emotion that while maybe slightly forced still overall serviced the story, and were balanced with rock solid production everywhere else. I can see how it lacks the depth to be a true classic, but I am shocked it is not more popular just based on the solid story, quality animation and combat alone.",1493337600,3,1288,4.620087336244541

Fighting is amazing and not the stereotypical samurai or ninja fighting.

Camera angles are very good and giving me the sense of realism on riding or running or jumping scenes.

Overall storyline is simple, I figure out those Ming assassins' goal early on.  What really shine is how No Name developed his relationship with Kotaro.  Also slowly revealing No Name's background.

It also shown human frailties, such as people in power or commoners succumb to power and greed.  Quite a complex movie, if you pay attention.

Interestingly, the epic fight was between a Chinese trained European swordsman and a Japanese trained European swordsman.

I wish Funimation or Amazon would have provided English subtitle for those Ming assassins when they spoke Chinese.  Voice actors' accent are rather thick and I can only make out a few conversation.  For those who don't know Mandarin Chinese, they would have felt a bit loss, not that those conversation was important to understand the story, still it would be nice to understand those conversations.",1482364800,6,1142,4.984126984126984

Mixing just the right amount of frenetic swordplay, fairly-realistic gore, well-executed action beats, and generic-but-likeable characters, this little action-er lines up nicely for a rousingly-paced yojimbo film.

Those in attendance voted to watch the English dubbed version; there were no complaints, and several compliments. We'll watch the original language version for our second viewing.

The sound design was fantastic, or at least it stuck out in my mind after my first viewing.

There are extras, but I didn't watch them, I'll get around to it sometime.

3824196,5,B001W79MBI,"Wow, I first saw this movie on youtube and immediately searched for it on Blu-ray to own. This movie was release in 2007 so its been about 8 years out in stores. I can appreciate the artistic value this movie has to offer since I'm a current student for animation. This is the very reason I choose a career path. But, enough about me. If you're reading this then you probably just want an opinion of the movie. So I'll give that to you!

The original story is by ""Bones"" and the movie director by Masahiro Ando and scripted by Fumihiko Takayama. The plot is early 1800's in Japan where a small Chinese mercenaries (The Ming) agree with Japanese to search and capture a small boy named Kotaro for a ritual of immortality. During Kotaro's flee with his loyal dog, they come across a nameless ronin called No-name. No-name is a man who is haunted by his past ordered to assassinate two small children air to dynasty. He later meets Kotaro and his dog while finding shelter. During their stay; they are attacked by Elite group of swordsmen while still no match for No-name and the aid of the dog. Kotaro finds value in the ronin and seeks to past the man for his protection also to get medical attention for his poisoned dog. Now, the challenge is to travel low key through villages and open land to get Kotaro to his destination a Buddhist temple with awaiting monks.

Kotaro is quickly betrayed and hand him over to begin the sacrifice ritual. No-name shortly after learns of the betrayal and go after to rescue the boy.
The Japanse has declared an all out battle with the Chinese Elite Army and the most electrifying fights happen. Dynamic sword play and an epic battle between the hero No-name and Ming's blonde hair warrior Luo-Ling! I think we know who come out victorious here. But, I will admit there were times to expect No-name was in over his head.

Overall great entertainment and spectacular performance. Well worth the money; that is if you truly appreciate timeless art and plan on watching it over and over. The actions were so smooth and natural its hard to believe it hand drawn. Some day, I would love to work on a project as such and perhaps I shall!

The scenery was so detailed and realistic that it pulls you right into the anime. I personally love the samurai genre and even though it feels like it can get played out, this one stands out as its own work. The dub was great and the characters were memorable, and the score wasn't bad either. You're in for plenty of blood and maiming, easily on par with the brutality in Afro Samurai, but this movie feels much more realistic. This movie will also give you an idea of just how sharp a sword or arrow can be... probably not for the faint of heart. In my opinion, this is definitely 5 stars and if you like the samurai genre of anime than this has to be in your collection.

They're probably the best animated fight scenes I've seen to date--beautifully choreographed, complex, realistic and detailed. I'd rate them higher than Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop. (Unrealistic anime fight scenes can leave the room right now.)

As far as colors and image quality, well, for one it's just DVD, not Blu-ray. The movie mainly sticks with browns and muted colors. Nothing's saturated. Even the clear blue skies look more content than bright and optimistic. It reminds me of the winter months, and I believe it settles the movie's tone very well.",1384041600,,737,4.943548387096774

It started out really good, but then in the middle it dragged on and began introducing all the characters to give them some kind of development, but not enough to make them interesting or likeable. The most arguably interesting character, the ""villain"", gets almost no development and ends up being another cliche. In fact, the movie is just riddled with lots of standard cliches we've seen countless times before, making it predictable and just not as good as it could have been. There's also A LOT of CG but that's kinda expected these days. In the end, it's a decent action flick but it had the potential to be great.",1374537600,,675,4.586776859504132

If you have not seen the movie but love anime fights like those in samurai champloo then this would be your thing. story wise the way the two main characters developed from begrudging companions using each other solely for survival to becoming friends is well done. The action is not over the top so don't expect the main characters to shoot energy blasts while randomly getting a power up at the end due to friendship or some other cliche. the fate of the main character is left up to your interpretation. its does not say what exactly happens to him. While this may sound off putting to some of you trust me it is done in a way that leaves you satisfied with the ending and you don't feel like the  story was incomplete.",1353715200,,799,4.4353741496598635
3824224,5,B001W79MBI,"I bought this expecting an entertaining, action-filled shonen flick, but what I got instead was something that was much stronger than I had anticipated.

While it -is- very classically shonen, the characters are surprisingly deep and three-dimensional, and I found myself caring about them - even the villains. The story isn't incredibly original but it does have a few ideas, and it serves well enough to show the characters in multiple lights.

The animation is absolutely gorgeous and fluid, particularly the fight scenes. The backgrounds are beautiful enough that I would happily hang them on my wall, and even weather effects are done very well (the snow is especially well-done).

I would like to give special attention to the music, because not only does it fit every scene it's in, it enhances the entire movie and the emotions each scene brings out. Fierce drums get your adrenaline flowing and string and wind instruments alternately bring you into the world and pull on your emotions to bring you further into the story. The music during the climax is particularly stirring, and you'll find yourself turning it up multiple times.

On the subject of sound, I watched the Dub, and I was quite happy with every voice actor and the effort put into each performance. Of special note is that the boy is played by an actual child rather than an adult woman (as is often found in anime), and he puts in an impressive performance - I learned he's the son of two voice actors, so I suppose it runs in the family! I didn't listen to the Sub, but I don't think anyone will have a problem with the Dub at all - it's all very professional and full of care and emotion.

Overall, I'd suggest this movie to any fan of not only anime, but action movies in general. It's an enjoyable ride that will pull you in more than you think, and after it's over you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again - that sort of pull is exactly what makes a movie worth owning rather than renting, and I'm definitely happy that I've added this to my collection.",1350172800,3,2039,4.621546961325967

3824227,4,B001W79MBI,"I'm a big anime fan, and when I saw this one in my recommendations, I just had to try it. So I purchase it, put it in, grab me a Diet Coke, and sit down to see how it all turns out. After the movie is over, I sit there and think this out before I start to type here. The movie was fantastic, but there was just a few things that had me hanging my head throughout the entire movie.

The first thing you'd notice in the movie is the absolutely beautiful animation. The art is all hand drawn, and it's definitely a throwback to before CG when you see the fighting scenes. Now, the fighting scenes are perhaps the absolute best part about this movie. I, personally, am not a pro fight scene guy if it sacrifices other aspects of the animation (we'll get to that later). The fight scenes however were just spectacular. The characters moved fluidly and the way the fights were well fleshed out is pure eye candy. The music fit perfectly and I found that it evoked the correct emotions for the scenes in which it played.

The plot is special in many ways. Kotaro and his dog are on the run from the Mings who have come to sacrifice him at a certain time so they can make an elixir of immortality for their master, and to protect himself, Kotaro hires a nameless samurai to protect him. When this was revealed to me, I just hung my head and said to the movie, ""Why?"". To be frank, this plot is cliched and overdone. Some of the characters are not fully fleshed out, such as Kotaro and why he is being targeted. Most of the time, the scenes are downright predictable, and it has its rushed moments. Unfortunately the plot is where this movie falls short.

BUT there is a shining light in there. The character development is so enthralling and fantastic that I believe viewers really should avoid the main plot and focus on how the characters develop throughout the movie and how they can relate to the themes. One major theme would have to be how evil can creep into everybody, no matter how high status, low status, rich, poor, moral, immoral, pure, or tainted you are. For the sake of keeping spoilers to a minimum, I will just say that each character shows this ""evil"" in some way, but it's only your main characters that can overcome this. In addition to the character development, the character relationships with one another are some of the most enticing I've seen, especially between the special trio (Tobimaru, Kotaro, and Nanashi). Each character helps the other grow and evolve in such a way to create compassion where none existed for others. The plot may have its problems, but the characters themselves outshine almost anything else in this movie, except for the fighting scenes mentioned earlier.

The bottom line is that this movie may not be the best plot wise, but makes up for it in character development, character relations, and fighting scenes. The graphics are beyond the normal and can only be compared to the best. The music is perfectly inputted and fits with every scene its in.

Overall: B+
Visuals: A+
Music: A
Plot: C+

Thanks to great chracterization this movie really keeps you invested in all invloved, and the action when it comes is very intense.

3824230,5,B001W79MBI,"What can I say the only reason I gave this one a shot was because it got 5 out of 5 stars on Amazon.com. However, I notice now that it's down to 4.5 stars. Guess there are some people out there who can't be pleased. Where do I begin? This movie was gorgeous in scope and in style. The sun and moon lighted landscapes were awe-inspiring. The plot while familiar in some ways doesn't fail to intrigue. Finally the thing that really won me over was the music. Such an important part in most films this one nailed the bullseye.

 The story opens with a young boy and his loyal dog being sent away from a burning temple to escape an sinister conspiracy. His trusted master assures him that he will be given sanctuary in another location. However, not all is as it seems. The boy and his dog travel and seek shelter in an abandoned hut where they rest. As luck would have it an wandering vagrant discovers the boy and asks if he to can bunk in the hut. The boy extremely reluctant to allow a stranger into his personal space rejects the man's plea. The vagabond's good nature is obvious from the begining ,but the boy doesn't budge.

 This is where the story hits a great twist. I won't reveal anymore, but I will say that this movie should be seen by all who have a love for action and wandering no name type movies. Heck it should be seen by everyone who wants an excellent movie experience. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as things unfolded and the climax was extremely satisfying.

I was so impressed by the level of realism (my god, when they cut someone they actually bleed) and character development.  True, this isn't some original, amazing plotline, but it's set up in a way that feels real and visceral.  You care about the characters, and you see and feel their struggles in their facial expressions and body language.

3824238,5,B001W79MBI,"Probably the best samurai anime since Samurai Champloo, this recent movie won international awards across the board. Studio Bones, best known for Fullmetal Alchemist and Eureka Seven through together this epic clash of Japanese and Chinese fighting styles, but with Western gaijin taking the center stage.

Set in 19th Century Japan, a local lord is working with some representatives from the Chinese emporer who are looking for a young boy whose blood is supposed to grant immortality in a ceremony that can only be held once a year. The sacrifice in question is Kotoro, and is on the run from the Chinese agents with his dog Tobimaru(who is arguably the most talented dog in all of anime!). They come across the ronin called ""No-Name"" because he never gives his actual name to the boy, although its later revealed to be Nanashi. He defends Kotoro from some samurai, but Tobimaru gets hit with a poison dart. Kotoro hires No-Name to help cure the dog while protecting him from the Chinese hoods. Amoung the Chinese warriors is the proficient and very blonde Luo-Lang who is mainly only in the whole business to find worthy opponents to fight, so basically he's this movie's ""Vegeta"". It's later revealed that No-Name is also a honkey as he really has red hair, but keeps coloring it black, probably so he won't be called a Ginger. No-Name delivers Kotoro and a healed Tobimaru to a monastery which is secretly controlled by the lord working with the Chinese. Kotoro is taken to a large monument erected for the sole purpose of taking in his blood to give to the Emporer of China. No-Name shows up in time to save Kotoro, although he's lucky as the Chinese agents and soldiers of the lord end up killing each other off, until all that's left are No-Name and Luo-Lang. Aside from the fact that his a top notch swordsman, Luo-Lang like the other Chinese uses a special drug that supresses pain, but what he doesn't know is that No-Name uses some of too in their duel. An epic fight ensues where No-Name just leaves Luo-Lang dead in his tracks, although No-Name appears to be near-fatally wounded as Kotoro rides off with him as they plan to be pirates(sequal!).

Sword Of The Stranger seriously fills in the void that has been forming for the last few years in anime as there hasn't been much any real samurai stuff at all. The closest example would be Samurai 7 which is really more of a sci-fi, but there has been almost nothing in the field of a samurai anime movie since probably the Rurouni Kenshin movie. Anyway, Bones comes through with some awesome animation and their traditionally somewhat jarheaded character designs. All the characters are each given their own rich background, even the supporting ones. Plus, this probably has the best fight choregraphy I've ever seen in an anime movie, and its not afraid to show any brutality in it, so Tanrentino fans are in for a real bloodbath with this bad mutha! I recommend that anyone that is a fan of action movies, epic adventure, and the true dark path of the samurai should check this one out.",1293753600,,3051,4.700934579439252

3824243,5,B001W79MBI,"I can't speak for the special features, since I haven't checked them out just yet.

PLOT (no spoilers):
Pretty standard fare.  A nameless swordsman must protect an innocent boy against the hostile battlefield of two warring factions.  The main antagonist group consists of an elite bunch of highly-skilled Chinese warriors who feel no pain, at the head of which is a mysterious blonde swordsman ailing at his inability to find a worthy adversary.  Lacking somewhat in the originality department, the story nonetheless draws you in by the sheer charisma of its characters.  The characters themselves convey their archetypes well, without being overly obvious.  The cliche factor is evident, but luckily it doesn't detract from your enjoyment of the film.

ANIMATION:
Though at times inconsistent (read: some of the battle clips appear noticably choppy, while others are smooth as silk), this feature is still head and shoulders over many of its contemporary counterparts.  The characters' movements are believably natural, and their facial subtext succeeds in making you actually care about what they're thinking.  At times, CGI is used for set pieces and background work, but it's so well-integrated that it complements without distracting, and is often unnoticable.  Most memorable of all is the climactic battle between the swordsmen No-Name and Luo Lang: this is far and away the single most visually arresting swordfight I have ever seen in an animated feature.  Ever.  It invokes a tangible feeling of suspense and wonder, the choreography is brilliant, the scope is incredible, the pacing is thrilling, and their movements are positively GORGEOUS.  It'll make the hairs on your neck stand up, mark my words.

SOUND:
I usually prefer subtitled anime over dubbed, as English voice-overs can be spotty, and often omit certain important nuances.  However, Sword of the Stranger's English voice actors are all very talented, and they mesh perfectly with the setting and their respective characters.  The sound effects are particularly well-done; at the moment when No-Name strikes the killing blow against his first Chinese opponent, the explosive crack of wood beams shattering and the brutal gnashing of bone pound straight through to your core.  It gives every action scene a very visceral and immersive feel.

BOTTOM LINE:
Sword of the Stranger simply must not be missed.  It's certainly not the most original thing out there, but its tried-and-true story formula can be appreciated by most anyone, and the action is definitely top-tier material.  This isn't a film you can watch only once.",1267574400,17,2595,5.282926829268293
3824244,4,B001W79MBI,"Sword of the Stranger / B001W79MBI

We watch a lot of anime at our house, but ""Sword of the Stranger"" really does stand out in terms of artwork. The art is apparently all hand drawn; the final effect is a look that is incredibly crisp, clear, and beautiful. Definitely a great deal of time and effort went into making a superb production - the voice acting is just as gorgeous as the art.

Although the story line is not particularly new or innovative (a young boy of destiny must be protected by a jaded and master-less traveling warrior), ""Sword of the Stranger"" really encapsulates why this type of story is such a classic. Both the young boy and the traveling warrior are wonderfully characterized, and their developing relationship as the two come to depend on each other is beautiful to behold. ""Sword of the Stranger"" also scores points for being willing to depict pretty much everyone in a position of political power (Chinese and Japanese alike) as being equally corrupted by power - somehow, it's always refreshing to see movies that are willing to dump the usual ""good country"" vs. ""bad country"" makeup and just wash its hands of the political leaders of both sides.

If there is a downside to ""Sword of the Stranger"", it may be that some of the introspective travel sequences seem a bit slow and drawn-out. Despite all the action, the movie somehow manages to retain an almost dreamy feel, making the movie seem longer than it actually is. I definitely recommend a viewing (particularly on the Blu-Ray version, if you want to give your eyes a real feast), but you might not feel that the replay value of this superb movie is all that you might want.

English when dialog takes place among when they are talking among their own people. I thought that was hot personally but some might just opt for subtitles. The sounds and fight sequence are truly top notch and you really benefit from hearing this on Blu Ray (DTS soundtrack) The story should have match the tracks of this movie as well, as you have some quirky dialogue from the little boy that really slows the movie down.

3824254,5,B001W79MBI,"Well, as was enevitable some users have given this movie a poor rateing, it was at 5 starts for the longest time. One user said it was boring and he was too old for anime, and another gave an inpresively long review of the movie and why he didn't like it. Well for the guy who is too old for anime because he's 23, perhaps you should not watch anime? The other user said he found the movie to gory and action was too predictable, the story one giant cliche and the charcters were under developed and I can respect his opinion.

First lets get to the gory action. I love it. One thing that really impressed me was unlike other animes like samurai X, and the movie highlander search for vengance and countless others, instead of just seeing a downward sword slash, follwed by a charcter splitting in too or dying after a few seconds delay you actually get to SEE the sword play and a a few lenghty fights. The choreogrophy was amazing and the best i've seen in an anime and you can tell they put alot of work and thought into it, and yes its very bloody. But hey if u don't like blood you aren't going to appreaciate this aspect of the movie.

The story, yes its is very cliche but you could say the same for ninja scroll(an evil villain wants to take over the world and one man can stop him), and vampire hunter D(girl gets catptured by evil vampire, half vampire hero saves her and falls in love with her). What really makes a story interesting is not so much the story itself but the CHARACTERS in the story. For me thats what makes movies like ninja scroll,vampire hunter D and Sword of the stranger really enjoyable. Not many people will enjoy a movie if they don't like the characters regardless of the plot. Which brings me to the next section

Characters. Well if you haven't allready guessed it, I really liked the characters. Nameless, that kid(forgot his name) and tobby maru the dog. For me theyve all been developed, though subtley. Nameless is a skilled warrior with a haunted past, but he's genuinly a pretty nice guy, that kid (i should probably have gooegled his name) is sarcastic and acts tough but you can tell its just a mask, that really he is pretty damned scared. And lets not forget tobby maru, who has allot of personallity for a non person. Generous loyal and brave, he gives his fish to nameless upon meeting him.

""Ok yeah we get it, you love this movie and are obviously a fanboy who cant take people critizing his favorite movies"". Oh contrair mon ami, there were a few things i didn't like about the movie. For one the colors seemed pretty bland, mostly browns(eww the color of doo doo) and yes i admit it wasn't the most original story ever told(why do all these animes villains have to aquire a child as the key to fulfilling thier evil plan? ex: metropolis, Sin the movie nad lots more).

Any way the thing that really did it for me besides the jaw dropping animation and truely loveabe(IMO)characters? The Ending, an epic sword battle follwed by what i thought was an extremly happy ending. Man i'm a sucker for happy endings.

3824256,5,B001W79MBI,"Sword of the Stranger is a FANTASTIC anime movie. The story is a little cliche (it's sort of a Japanese vs. Chinese story, with the old Kenshin-style fallen samurai searching for redemption thrown in), but the story works with the artwork and action sequences and everything else as a whole to make something that seems more novel than the story alone would suggest.

The characters are all well-formed and well-acted, and seem much more substantial than the traditional Ninja Scroll-style villain. The little kid, Kotaro, and his dog could have been sickly sweet and too cute for their own good, but they are instead depicted realistically, so they don't derail the entire movie. The fallen samurai with no name is a bit of a Kenshin ripoff, but his interactions with Kotaro and the other characters seem genuine enough and his character arc seems complete and real, so it's forgivable. The main villain, the foreigner working for the Chinese, is suitably terrifying and believably monstrous.

The pacing of the story is just perfect, with an awesome swordplay demonstration by the foreign tough guy to start things off, little tastes of action here and there throughout the middle, and an explosive finale that literally leaves entire armies in piles of bloody chunks. The Chinese influence is definitely there, and if you've seen movies like Once Upon a Time in China or Iron Monkey, the finale especially will seem familiar. It looks and feels like a Hong Kong wuxia film cranked up to 11.

For anyone who likes anime movies like Ninja Scroll or the Samurai X OVA, or Hong Kong wuxia films like Hero or House of Flying Daggers, I can't recommend Sword of the Stranger enough. I haven't seen an example of this genre that's this good in YEARS.",1254528000,,1746,4.852348993288591

3824260,4,B001W79MBI,"Sword of the Stranger is an action movie. The movie takes itself seriously. And despite this being the directors first movie, the attention to detail with the environment prevents it from feeling like a static world. The very limited amount of humor present helps to keep the mood right for the film, but could turn some away. The level of gore is high at times, but not so bad you can't look.
Like most action films, there is a story. And like most action films it isn't the most memorible story. However, the animation quality and the music are great. The Japanese voice actors do an excellent job. Some fan favorites from live-action were casted for major roles. And the young boy that did the voice for the youngest character is spot on. Despite the story not grabbing me like other movies recently, there is a point and there is some character development. The treatment of the Chinese forces present in the film is not in the best light (as expected with Japan). But, interestingly the characteristics that the Japanese characters show are not any better.
Even though I have high praise for this movie, it simply doesn't have much more to offer on blu-ray than with DVD. The picture quality is not vastly improved. It doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look much better than on DVD. That is the only reason I have given this 4/5 stars and not 5/5.",1249689600,2,1352,4.590909090909091

3824262,5,B001W79MBI,"Sword of the Stranger has beautiful animation and is the best swordfight anime I've seen in the last few years. While the plot is familiar (broody/silent warrior helps bratty orphan) it's packed with a lot of action scenes that are very bloody ala Kill Bill.

Set during the Sengoku (feudal warring states) era in Japan, the story is about Kotarou, an orphan boy being hunted by Chinese Ming soldiers. He and his loyal (and cute) dog meets Nanashi a nameless wandering samurai. They travel together and eventually cross paths with Rarou, the strongest of the Ming warriors who is also looking for a worthy opponent to fight with.

The 'stranger' in the story happens to be a foreigner. Nanashi the ronin is often haunted by nightmares of his past. He doesn't know his real name and only knows that he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He dyes his naturally red hair black to blend in. Rarou the Ming swordsman is also a westerner, he is big, blond and blue eyed. It is not explained how he ended up in China. Anyway, these two meet up in one of the best animated swordfight scenes in a long time.

It's interesting that the strongest swordsmen in this story happen to be outsiders - westerners. While both the Japanese and Chinese overlords are far from honorable. One weak spot is the lack of explanation to why Kotarou is specifically important to the Ming emperor's immortality ceremony.

So if you are a fan of Yoji Yamada & Kurosawa sword flicks and anime like Rurouni Kenshin (identical to Nanashi, guilt-ridden red hair swordsman) & Samurai Champloo you will enjoy this film.",1247788800,,1586,4.694244604316546
