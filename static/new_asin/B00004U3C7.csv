The alignment sequences were interesting but not too informative.  However, there was one part that was EXTREMELY interesting.  Gerald Posner (author of Case Closed and an ""expert"" on Oswald) repeatedly referred to Oswald's military service as the Army.  I can't recommend this dvd or video as it doesn't add much.",973987200,3,479,5.181818181818182

7923504,3,B00004U3C7,"I found the no-Grassy-Knoll revelation disturbing - considering eye witnesses and the physics involving initial impact [Physicists please assist].

However, viewers who believe strongly in the Knoll as the fatal bullet source may be surprised (as I was) to learn of a potential location for a second behind the limousine assassin plus the Russian idea that this character Oswald was even nuttier than Gerald Ford said he was - and that it *had* to be someone else.

A lazer beam test is run and it's compelling...although even a *high speed* bullet doesn't duplicate a lazer.

Dr. Posner is on the scene once again with his connect the dots story of a nobody -Oswald - trying to be a somebody...at the expense of a President's life.",1280880000,3,732,4.84
7923505,1,B00004U3C7,"I have been researching the JFK murder, for 30 plus years.  Not only is this just a bunch of people paid to fit the evidence to a theory, moreover,it keeps away from common sense and far away from the truth at best. This forensic doctor is an absolute shame artist, he will bend the facts to the highest bidder. You do not have to take my word, look his work up.  Remember, once involved, a government is always the highest bidder. Shame on them for using the same tactics the Warren representatives did by shouting down one guy with two or more people against a guy just trying to keep them honest.  Crackpots and Bullies at best.

Were is the lazer on a moving car, with the wind, with a nervous killer and through a Texas Live Oak tree?  Where is the 2nd rifle? Shooting from a building down is very hard because the bullets do not travel in a straight line, and shooting down at a car moving away from you is next to impossible in less than 6 seconds.  Shooting on the flat is a whole other ball of wax and is how they set it up, oh but they forgot to move the cars didn't they.  Where is the missing brain? Where is that rusty rifle, and bent $2.00 scope?  These people did not even look at the reason the car slowed ... or why it changed lanes. And what about that Magic Bullet, the report hinges on, WOW, that is some bullet.  Seven wounds, according to the Warren Report, and hardly scratched??

According to the testemoney of 2 whitnesses, one a MD who knew guns intimitly, there was a hole, a through and through front to back in the windshield.  Why were whitnesses misstated and Yelled at and bullied or worse?  How could Oswald have fired a gun, hid the gun, run down 4 flights of stairs, purchased a bottle of coke from a machine and start to drink the coke all in less than 90 seconds were the first cop confronted him on the second floor,and not be out of breath or at least breathing hard? Where? Not any place in this film.

This is another misleading volume of the Warren Report to try and keep people from taking down the real murderer of JFK, the CIA.

Everyone knows it... no evidence, my left foot! How many people are convicted on cercumstantial evidence everyday?  Why don't we ask ex-president H.W. Bush a few questions about his where abouts, when Kennedy was killed.  Better...why don't we investigate why the CIA did it and how they covered it up.  Why don't we bring in all the serviving members of everyone who gained by Kennedys Murder?  And ask them???  This is a shame movie ... And can not stand up to scrutiny by anyone other than those who want to believe the Government never lies to its people!  The people, you, are not any closer to the truth and will not be until you/we hold the Government Responsible.",1207612800,8,2745,4.345098039215686
7923506,1,B00004U3C7,"Do you despise those shows that promise to ""Break the case"", or ""Cause a storm of controversy"" or ""blow the lid off of the case"", yet do absolutely nothing of the sort? Do you hate shows that waste your time with predictable protocol, while promising to ""break new ground""?

  Yeah, me too.

 That's why I hate this show, and the political butt kissing charade that was Peter Jenning's ""investigative"" show into the assassination.

  These people promise us new, ""secret"" info and proceed to tell JFK Assassination researchers things that we have known for over 40 years, as if its breaking news or something!

  It's all about ""sex appeal"" as G. Robert Blakey termed his House Select Commitee's ""Investigation"" into the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

 It's all about ""sex appeal, or selling the product"". Not about the integrity of the product. Hookers sell themselves, with no integrity, and so does the U.S Government and their buddies who work for the TV stations who produce propagandized garbage like this show.

 That the product belongs in a rodeo arena with the rest of the bull flop doesnt seem to penetrate the conscience of these fraudulent ""Investigators"".

 Take these nerds on this DVD, with their ""Laser tests"". These Captain Kirk wannabe's are ridiculous enough to think that their cute laser tag games can actually solve a case that has been an enigma for almost a half a century now? These people have zero comprehension when it comes to the JFK murder.

  So much so that they actually are ridiculous enough to use THE WARREN COMMISSION SCENARIO of the Assassination, while conducting their tests, even though 40 years of fact finding work by JFK researchers has exposed the Warren Report as a work of fiction.

 Commission member Gerald Ford ADMITTED that the commission mislead the American people by purposely MISPLACING the actual location of JFK's back wound!

  SO, THE LASER NERDS ON THIS DVD USED ""EVIDENCE"" WHICH HAS BEEN  SHOWN TO BE A LIE, in order to try and see what happened during the time when JFK was shot.

 Well duh....of course if you use flawed evidence, you will get flawed results that match that flawed evidence.

 Yet the desperate producers of this show lamely make it appear that the Warren Commission was right about the wounds to Kennedy and Governor Connally, despite the fact that a member of the commission admitted that they deliberately mislead the American people about the true nature of Kennedy's wounds, because it didn't make sense.

  So, if you use ""evidence"" that is wrong, in an experiment, that experiment will be wrong also.

 So, don't be mislead by the ""laserbrains"" on this show. Their corny lasers cannot reconstruct a large EXIT wound in the BACK of Kennedy's head. Only the rifle of the gunman on the grassy knoll could cause such a wound.

  The fact of the matter is that the KGB were too busy putting ""bugs"" (Listening devices) on the toilets of innocent Russians, that they have little info in the JFK case that can actually add to what we have known for years.

 Also, you must be aware that the U.S. Government allies of these former KGB officials would never allow any damning evidence to be leaked by their Russian buddies.

 So, all in all, this show, like the transparent Peter Jennings show on the same case, promises to give us new answers, yet ends up giving us a case of nausea and the re-occurring thought of ""Why did I waste my time with this crapola?""

  So, if you want to watch this show, be my guest. But you will be wasting your money, when you could have just rented it for less, or better yet, not wasted your time with factually incorrect shows to begin with.

  For shows that deal with the FACTS on the case, I highly recommend the series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"". It is available on DVD and although the show isn't flawless, ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" has what this ""Secret KGB JFK Assassination files""  DVD and what the Peter Jennings JFK murder DVD doesnt have......integrity.",1118102400,9,3990,4.754744525547445
7923507,1,B00004U3C7,"What you do not get on this DVD is any new information based upon KGB investigations into the JFK assassination.  Instead, here's what's actually on this DVD:
1. There's about 10 minutes of the history of why the KGB investigated JFK's death which is the only interesting part of the DVD, but which sheds absolutely no light on the whole matter.
2. There are about 10 minutes about Oswald's trip to the USSR which researchers have already known about for a long time.  What the DVD completely fails to mention is such interesting evidence as, e.g., the training Oswald received from the Marines in speaking Russian prior to this trip, suggesting, albeitly inconclusively, that this trip may have been part of a military intelligence operation.
3. The rest of the video having anything to do with Russia (about another 10 minutes) merely shows that based upon information everyone else in the world already knew, the KGB concluded that JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy and not by a lone gunman, but they still debate amongst themselves just as much as anyone else who did it and for what motive.
Particularly fishy on this DVD is a scene, captured on ""hidden camera"", of someone supposedly purchasing secret KGB files from Russian blackmarketers.  Several items calling this scene into doubt are: i) the buyer is originally quoted a sum of only $5000, which is extremely little for stealing any KGB files, let alone those regarding the JFK assassination, ii) the blackmarketers appear to have american accents (the sound quality isn't very good so I can't say with absolute certainty), iii) the blackmarketers have perfect american speech patterns, iv) the blackmarketers, now demanding an undisclosed extra amount of money, hand over the documents to the buyer to examine before getting the additional amount now required, v) the blackmarketers are unarmed and don't bother pursuing the buyer as he then ""escapes"" up the stairs and into an empty parking lot.  If this really happened, Russian blackmarketers do not deserve their scary reputation.
And all that these secret files supposedly reveal is that the KGB suspected possible Vietnamese involvement in the assassination, which is completely inconsistent with a subsequent coverup by the US government.  The US would blare such information everywhere in order to support their ""police action"".
4. The rest of the film, as noted by others, has nothing to do with KGB files, but instead reports evidence about the assassination in an extremely selective manner in order to avoid making Warren Commission apologists like Posner, whom they give a forum, look completely foolish.  Posner suggests, against all evidence, that Oswald was a lone anarchist gunman who killed JFK and lied about being a Marxist in order to get on the news.  Based upon evidence proven to be false (completely discounted forensic reports contradicting all physical and photographic evidence, and apparently the altered Zapruder film) a couple of Russian forensic experts conclude JFK was shot from behind with a magic bullet.  A team of U.S. forensic experts, OPERATING UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT JFK WAS SHOT FROM BEHIND, set up a test to determine where the shot came from using lasers.  Their first several tests show that if he was shot from behind, that it came from the second floor of the Bell-Tex building and not the 6th floor of the book depository, so the ""experts"" unscientifically keep altering the positioning of their dummies and the car until they get the result they want.  These experts also ignore, e.g., the fact that a tree used to block the view from the depository.  One guy proves he can, after repeated practice, while lying down at ground level and with no visual obstructions and without the need to adjust for aim, shoot accurately at three completely stationary ground level targets in only 6 seconds while using the same kind of rifle as Oswald supposedly used (without fully duplicating the wear and tear to the rifle found at the depository), thus proving absolutely nothing.  All of these ""tests"" are reported uncritically by the filmmakers.  In an attempt to show they're balanced, the filmmakers provide a few minor soundbites from people like Mark Lane.
Of course it's impossible to summarize all the evidence regarding JFK in 90 minutes, but this film manages to avoid reporting even any of the most important and uncontroversial evidence while giving a forum to people conducting experiments based upon unscientific assumptions contradicting such evidence.  I don't pretend to know the answers to the JFK assassination, but this DVD is absolute nonsense.",1043020800,43,4623,5.073781291172596
7923508,1,B00004U3C7,"This DVD has little to do with any ""secret KGB files""; it is largely bombast constructed from stock footage.
