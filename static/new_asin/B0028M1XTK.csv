8356374,5,B0028M1XTK,"This is a great video on the subject of stem-cell research.
The basic premise of this video is the fact that while all the hype around embryonic stem cell research is politically driven, the actual, beneficial and proven working adult stem sell research is what should be encouraged.
1.) Embryonic stem cell research is a desired toy of some scientists, even though the morality of eradicating embryos for the sake of yet to be found benefits of desired cure is questionable. It seem immoral to destroy 'human organismal life' for the sake of a presumably soon to be discovered greater good.
2.) Adult stem cell research is actually proven beneficial on numerous occasions, and does not involve destruction of embryos.
3.) Embryonic stem cell research, in addition to be seemingly morally wrong in itself, requires lots of eggs. However, harvesting of eggs is hazardous and inhumane, because:
-- a.) It treats women as means to an end. That is, treating them as gold mines of valuable and precious eggs.
-- b.) It leads to severe health hazards, and even death for many of those victims.
-- c.) It constitutes, and arguably will increase even more, the human trafficking. Since women are viewed as means to get desired embryos, the poorer countries will suffer the most, because women there are more prone to be duped into very dangerous business of selling their eggs.

Overall informative video on the subject of stem-cell research and  cloning. It is recommended for all because majority of people know very little about it, and popular movie actors and other figures of publicity often used to promote political agenda, and misrepresent the facts on the subject.
So, if you wonder what is the difference, what are the benefits and drawbacks of embryonic stem cell research as compared to the adult stem cell research, watch this video.",1242777600,6,1839,4.948220064724919
