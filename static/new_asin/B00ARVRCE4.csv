5495025,5,B00ARVRCE4,"You cant destroy me, Stefan. Nothing can.

So are the dying words of Radu Vladislas (Anders Hove) at the climax of Subspecies. Picking up right where that film left off, Stefan and his new vampire bride, Michelle Morgan (Denice Duff) lay down for the day while Radus headless corpse lies in the next room. With the help of his little minions (making their only appearance in the film) Radu reattaches his head to his body and bee-lines for Stefans resting place. Once there, he pushes a stake through his half-brothers heart, destroying him. He then turns his vengeful sights to Michelle to do the same, the early morning rays of the sun come streaming through the window forcing Radu to retreat. When night falls, Michelle escapes the castle, grabbing the bloodstone from her now deceased loved ones ashen hands and makes her way to Bucharest where she makes contact with her sister, Rebecca (Melanie Shatner). When Rebecca arrives, instead of finding her sister, she finds police lieutenant Marin (Ion Haiduc) and American Embassy worker Mel Thomspon (Kevin Blair) who inform her that Michelle has gone missing and the only thing left behind is the coveted bloodstone.

Most sequels tend to either be carbon copies of the original or are so completely different you wonder why they weren't just marketed as an original film. Bloodstone walks that careful line of being a faithful sequel while still introducing a few new things to the mix, like Radus Mummy (Pamela Gordon). It actually feels like the next chapter instead of re-treading old ground. Ted Nicolaou who directed the first film also returns as writer as well and while the great mythology from the first film is neglected with hammy dialogue, we still get Radu in all his badassdom. Unlike some more recent vampire flicks where the bloodsuckers sparkle in daylight and look like they belong in a Kalvin Klein ad, the vampires of Subspecies are ugly, mean and the most unglamorous things you could possibly imagine. Any yearning to become a child of the night is quickly squashed when Radu slobbers all over the screen.

Okay, these films are cheesy, low budget and won't leave you with any thought-provoking messages. What they are are entertainment at its lowest. Thats not to say these films are bad, but even their most supportive fans will admit they won't win any awards.

Acting wise, this film fares better than your average low-budget schlock, though only marginally. Anders Hove (once again) steals the movie with his raspy-voiced portrayal of the evil Radu. Even through pounds of make-up hes able to emote better than most A-list actors could under similar circumstances. Denice Duff does an admirable job as the troubled Michelle, though her acting is too over-the-top when a more subtle approach would have been much better. Another stand-out performance is Pamela Gordon as Mummy. Shes literally covered head-to-toe in make-up and makes the most of it. She cackles in a high-pitched voice that is reminiscent of the witch from The Wizard of Oz, though much more diabolical.

Onto the special features. We get a nifty little bundle. First up is the commentary track featuring writer/director Ted Nicolaou, Denice Duff and Anders Hove. Its a lively track recollecting stories from making the films in Romania, though one wishes that Anders would have spoken up a bit more. He spends the majority of the track just sitting back and letting Nicolaou and Duff speak. At one point Ted tries to get Hove to speak about a certain scene to which Hove ho-hums and falls silent again.

Making Subspecies is a brief talk with the three main principles: Ted Nicolaou, Denice Duff and Anders Hove. Its basically a summation of the commentary with the three nearly begging Charles Band to pony up the cash for a fifth film.

Killer Subspecies Montage is simply that: a montage of the first three films accompanied by the main theme with selected dialogue over the images.

Full Moon trailers are a bunch of trailers that oddly enough doesnt feature anything for Subspecies II or III. Instead we get previews for Puppet Master 1-3, Castle Freak, Subspecies, Grindhouse series promo, Puppet Master X: Axis Rising, Kill Joy goes to Hell and Reel Evil trailers all in HD.

Finally, we get the original Video Zones that accompanied most of Full Moons movies back in the nineties. This is a real treat for those who rented these and other films back in the day. They are behind-the-scenes for the films they accompany. They also feature interviews with actors in upcoming (back then) films and several trailers for their films.

The picture and sound quality are far more superior than even the DVDs that rolled out a few years ago. Colors, whether bright or dark, pop off the screen. To put it simply, this film looks gorgeous. Fans will want this simply for the picture and sound quality alone.

Bottom line is, if you're not a fan this film probably won't win you over. If you are, you owe it to yourself (and poor Charles Band) to pick this up with the first and third films as well (Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm has yet to see a blu-ray release).",1405123200,4,5104,4.855172413793103
5495026,4,B00ARVRCE4,"SIDEBAR:  This was filmed back to back with Subspecies III, which follows in the spirit of the franchise by picking up exactly where this movie ends.

Michelle narrates as this sequel picks up immediately where Subspecies left off:  fledgling vampire vixens lay dead on the ground beside Radu's beheaded body (Anders Hove; Subspecies I-IV, Critters 4).

Director Ted Nicolaou (Subspecies, Terror Vision, Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys) has stepped up his game.  Right away the effects seem to have graduated from the already impressive (i.e., on a low budget) Subspecies.  The claymation of Radu's subspecies minions is green-screened more subtly and their movements are more ambitious as, for example, two of the diminutive demons work together to remove the wooden stake from Radu's chest.  As Radu's head reattaches itself we find much more elaborate effects and creative gore than previously seen.  A la The Thing (1982), arterial tendrils whip from his detached head and affix themselves to his body.  As they drag his head into place is spinal cord extends outward to receive it.  Already I'm impressed!

But wait, there are more new effects hailing scare-tastic fun.  When Radu slays his sleeping brother (who defeated him in a the end if Subspecies), we watch as Stefan's face sinks into a fleshy slimy mess with exsanguination.  We also enjoy more creative depictions of Radu's ""shadow gliding"" ability (which allows him to quickly move ""through"" interconnecting shadows).

Replacing Laura Mae Tate (Dead Space, Subspecies), Denice Duff (Subspecies III-IV, Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation) assumes the role of now-vampire Michelle, who was turned by Stefan in the end of Subspecies.  Escaping the castle with the bloodstone and slowly learning what it means to be a vampire, Michelle turns to her sister Becky (Melanie Shatner; The Alien Within, Subspecies III, Star Trek V) for help.  Meanwhile Radu turns to his ""Mummy"" (Pamela Gordon; Weird Science, Poltergeist II, Subspecies III, Alien Nation), a crone-like ghoul akin to an unwrapped mummy that is hungry for the bloodstone.

Embassy representative Mel and local Romanian Lt. Marin try to help Becky find her sister.  They then team up with occult history Professor Popescu and visit the fortress where Michelle was staying (in Subspecies).  Whereas the effects in this sequel are far superior to the original, these characters (including our female leads Becky and Michelle) just aren't as strong as the protagonists in part 1.  They don't carry the scenes well and often they don't seem confident enough for their roles.  Only in the final scene do Michelle and Becky find the strength to fight Radu.  Understandably, Michelle spent much of the story suffering from her transition to vampirism and the associated urges.  But I just feel too much of this movie's running time was filled with unconfident characters.
Here's another issue.  The franchise is called Subspecies yet we only see the subspecies demons in the opening scene.  This sequel is called Bloodstone yet the Bloodstone seems to play really no more major part in this sequel than in the original (or part 3, FYI).

Accordingly, the finale is not as powerful as part 1.  Yes, Radu is again defeated and yes, there's some blood, some fire and a lot of stabbing.  But it's nothing special and has nothing as cool as the decapitation or ""chandelier death"" of the original.  Maybe it's not fair to compare it to the fantastic effects and gore of the opening scene, or maybe they just didn't try as hard because Subspecies III was filmed back to back with this and they never put much thought into a ""big ending"" (as they clearly did for Subspecies), already being obviously aware that this was not ""the end.""  If that's the case, then part 3 better have one Hell of a finale!

In either case, I very much enjoyed this and, as I'd advise you, I watched Subspecies III immediately after this for the sake of story continuity.  So enjoy and stay tuned for my review of Subspecies III: Bloodlust.",1385856000,,4029,5.003003003003003
5495027,3,B00ARVRCE4,"You can't keep a good horror villain down, so it doesn't come as a surprise that ghoulish vampire Radu's death lasts about.... oh, five and a half minutes.

Sadly, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't quite live up to the standards of its colorful B-movie predecessor. Oh, it's still got plenty of gooey blood, skeletons and Radu being hilariously awesome, but the main characters seem to have been badly wussified. And the introduction of Radu's ""mummy"" (who even looks like one) just doesn't add anything to the movie.

When the ""subspecies"" creatures reattach Radu's head, he returns to life and immediately kills Stefan. Michelle (Denise Duff) barely manages to escape his castle with the Bloodstone (which has somehow morphed into a white stone in a claw) and runs away to the nearest city. She pleads with her sister Becky to come get her, then immediately ends up on a wild trip through the city's nightside.

Meanwhile, Radu has decided that he sorta kinda likes Michelle, so he asks his ""mummy"" to help him take back the Bloodstone and make Michelle his plaything. Yes, the evil vampire is asking his mommy to help him. Meanwhile, Becky (Melanie Shatner, daughter of William) arrives in Romania and tries to figure out what is going on with her sister, and discovers the horrifying truth of what Michelle is enmeshed in.

Even though it takes place only minutes after the last movie, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't work quite as well. The major reason is that both Michelle and Radu are drastically wussified - Michelle spends most of the story whining, crying and throwing up, and Radu starts running to his desiccated mother for help.

Additionally, a good one-third of the story is just Michelle running around the city, crying, whining and donning increasingly gothic clothing. However, the other two-thirds are actually quite solid, especially since it alternates between the day and night sides of the city. It hasn't quite got the flavor of the original, but the inclusion of club-gothic and Victorian gothic is a nice touch.

And the climax is pretty deliciously ""Subspecies"" -- we have gooey blood, repeated stabbings, and someone being set on fire. So basically, it's lots of fun.

Shatner gives a fairly decent performance as a strong, businesslike young woman who is having to grapple with the news that vampires not only exist, but that her sister is one. Kevin Spirtas is more of an annoyance than an actual character, and Michael Denish makes a decent Van Helsing for most of the movie. And... well, I'm not sure if Pamela Gordon actually plays ""Mummy,"" or if she just voiced a blind dried-up mummy that someone dragged out of an Incan grave.

It's not quite as good as the first one, but ""Subspecies II"" is a decent sequel with a nice new lead character and some delicious atmosphere. So now, on to ""Subspecies III.""",1364601600,,2821,4.874739039665971

8557017,5,B00ARVRCE4,"Bloodstone: Subspecies 2 is a sequel worth jumping straight into. Kicking off where Subspecies left off, we see the vampire Radu (Hove) being reassembled by his little red minions. Radu awakes and slaughters his sleeping brother, but is chased away by the encroaching sunlight before he can kill his brothers mate Michelle (Duff) and before he can take the Bloodstone. What follows is a chase through the streets of Bucharest.

Denice Duff takes over the role of Michelle from Laura Mae Tate, but it isn't one of those cast changes that some may find particularly jarring. The biggest shock is just how long Michelles hair has grown. Duff gives a more innocent and vulnerable performance, but is also able to hold a sultry and seduction presence.",1524355200,,746,4.920634920634921

Reconstituted, Radu stakes his little brother and tries to do the same with Michelle, who is now a whole new woman with long hair and two more expressions than the previous actress had.  But.  The sun forces Radu to race back to his hidey-hole.  That night Michelle takes a train bound for Bucharest, the shadow of Radu trailing behind.  What does Radu want more, the Bloodstone that Michelle stole, or revenge?

Well, its still not much of a horror series in that it lacks a certain prime ingredient.............horror!  There is no sense of urgency, no menace, not even a decent jump-scare.  All it really has going for it is that wacky vampire, pasty-face Radu (Anders Hove).  When he throws a hissy-fit on his brothers bones that at least proved he had dance moves.  But he will mutter his dialog in that raspy voice making most of it unintelligible.
