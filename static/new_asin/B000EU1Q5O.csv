2534542,5,B000EU1Q5O,"Dirty Dozen Double Feature is the sequels # 3 and 4 to the original 1st movie ""Dirty Dozen"". There is sequel # 2 ""Dirty Dozen -Next Mission"" which starred Lee Marvin.
The Double Feature here stars Ernest Borgnine and Telly Savalas. The other actors are some faces you will recognize and all are good in this double feature. For made for TV movies, they really spent some money making these movies. Filmed in Europe and the uniforms and equipment seen are very authentic. A good war movie must have authentic equipment to meet my approval. The story lines are good as well as the dialog. Telly Savalas is great in these two features. A must addition to my war movie collection. Now if they will only release sequel # 2 on DVD. I have seen ""Next Mission"" on TV several years ago and enjoyed it. If your a ""Dozen"" fan, suggest you get these sequels...",1295049600,2,848,4.47741935483871

The Dirty Dozen was one of the key flims of its time to revive war films, set with a very different war back drop, supported cast , click editing, supporting screen play brings nostalgic memories to war movie lovers.  Both the films don't let you down but show how better the second movie looks technically , and mistakes made up on the first movie.  Lee Marvin plays a typical role with ease , the cast and the plot key to both the exciting ends to both the movies",1232323200,,515,4.23469387755102
2534547,4,B000EU1Q5O,"Although not quite as good as the original Lee Marvin ""Dirty Dozen"" these two are well worth the price and are a good continuation of the series.  Telly was a great replacement for Lee.",1197417600,2,185,4.4411764705882355
2534548,4,B000EU1Q5O,"Here is a short explaination for those of you that are on this page going ""what the hell are these films?"" If your on this page I'm sure you know about the film The Dirty Dozen. That likeable tough-guy WWII film was a box office success back in 1967 but it seems few people today know that it inspired three sequels. Yes the sequels were all roughly made 20 years after and for TV but three sequels did follow. The first sequel ""The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission"" was released in 1985 with Lee Marvin returning. The film must have brought a good crowd to the TV as two more sequels were soon made: ""Dirty Dozen: The Deadly Mission"" and ""The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission"" both which are featured here in this double feature (""Next Mission"" is availabe in the Special 2 Disc Edition of the first Dirty Dozen)

Lee Marvin opting out of these last two entries (perhapes by his death) was replaced by Telly Savalas who reprises his role from the original Dirty Dozen. To be honest I wasn't all that hot with the second Dirty Dozen film ""Next Mission"". It was alright entertainment for a TV made film but I doubt I will be watching it much. I however was surprised by how much I liked these other two sequels with Telly Savalas. I'm not sure but Savalas, even in his old age, has a screen presence to him that makes these sequels very enjoyable. The plots arn't all that enthrawling or great but Savalas makes these films worth checking out. Savalas in each sequel is surrounded by a cast that many seasoned film enthusiests will recognize such as Bo Svenson (Walkign Tall Parts 2 & 3), Thom Matthews (Return of the Living Dead I & II), Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters 1 & 2), amongst others. I had a great time playing ""spot that actor"".

For TV made sequels these are pretty entertaining. Sure the plots lack but Savalas and the rest of the cast keeps the films trucking along. The production value on these films are also great considering the hinderence fo being shown on TV. If your fan of the film The Dirty Dozen then I highly recommend picking up it's now rarely seen TV made sequels. Now only if they would release the short lived 80's Dirty Dozen television series to DVD...

When I first ordered this DVD I was expecting a ""flipper"" (a double sided disc with a film on each side) like most other MGM double features. MGM however was nice enough to have each film on a seperate disc. I like this because it helps prevent against smudges and scratches. Both films are in Full Screen. They were filmed for TV so they were never shot in widescreen. There are no special features. I actually thought I would never see these little seen TV sequels on DVD so I thank MGM for the simple fact of releasing them.

On a side note that has nothing to do with the films, I found it an annoyance that all three sequels have differences in the titles. ""The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission"" has no ""The"" in the subtitle. ""Dirty Dozen: The Deadly Mission"" has no ""The"" before Dirty. ""The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission"" has ""The"" in both places. You think the person in charge of titling would have found some uniformity between them but oh well...it's just a minor thing :-)",1163289600,29,3150,4.454072790294627
2534549,4,B000EU1Q5O,"First there was the classic Dirty Dozen. then Lee Marvin agaonm starred as Major John Reismanin for 1985 made-for-TV sequel The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (which is on the new two disk version of the Dirty Dozen)

1n 1987, Marvin's Maj. John Reisman was replaced by (1967 Dozen cast member) Telly Savalas's Major Wright for two further TV movies  which this collection is made of

Savalas's Wright  tries to act similar to Marvin's Reisman. It is still twelve convicts sent on a secret mission. In both TV movies on this DVD collection,  Ernest Borgnine cameos as General Worden (the role he created for the original Dozen movie)

What annoys me is the LOVE BOAT style casting  these movies have. In Deadly Mission, the film has such actors as Randall ""tex"" Cobb, Vince Edwards (Ben Casey), Bo Svenson (Walking Tall) and the Van Patten Brothers (James & Vincent). In Fatal Mission, the actors are Jeff Conaway (Taxi,Babylon 5), Alex Cord (Airwolf), Erik Estrada (CHiPs), Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters, tv's OZ), Heather Thomas (The Fall Guy) and Boxer Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini.

The other problem with the film, when it comes to guns, battle sounds--Those are three time higher than the dialog. So you have to turn up the sound to hear what they say and turn down the sound for the war scenes

Now other than that, these two TV movies are great work for TV movies. The action is there. The plots is there. It works very well as a set of TV movies brought to DVD.

It has ""war movie stuff"" so minimally entertaining if that is your thing, but acting is so so and basically I did not care about any of the actors so if they got killed it was no big to me. Original movie is one of my favorites. This movie could not wipe that movie's bum -- Heather Thomas or not!

is great as the leader of the mission and the cast is many well know actors of the 80's. The ending is great with the explosions and train
wreck but then they just walk off. What happened to the dirty dozen after the mission? oh well it's still better and more fun than any of

8114379,3,B000EU1Q5O,Telly Savalas just does not cut it as the lead role in this movie. He is just the wrong kind of actor to take over for Lee Marvin. Ernest Borgnine plays a little bit of his original character and he does pretty well but it's mostly a mediocre war movie. The original Dirty Dozen movie was really good movie that didn't take itself real seriously but it was good done the same and extremely entertaining. This one has all kinds of issues that make it hard to believe in and sometimes a little painful to watch. For some reason there is a female lieutenant they just had to take with them on the mission even though she has no combat experience or training. She's basically the generals administrative aide. This time one of The Dirty Dozen is a rotten egg. The story is pretty laughable as it involves the Nazis trying to set up the fourth Reich for after the end of the war by sending a bunch of 3rd stringers to Istanbul. But there's enough action to make it watchable. It's kind of disappointing for those of us really love the original though,1473552000,,1045,4.391752577319588
8114380,1,B000EU1Q5O,"Even had Telly Savalas in it, and they still couldn't recall the awesomeness of production from the original. Sad, poorly executed sequel to a great movie. Even deleted it from my library.",1473206400,,188,4.90625
