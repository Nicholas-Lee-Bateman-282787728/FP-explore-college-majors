4143141,5,B003L77GG0,"Clark has a dagger made from blue kryptonite in him and Lois pulls it out and throws it away where Clark heals after seeing is death in a dream given by his Kryptonian father.  Clark faces a clone version of Lex where he has to save Lois in Smallville and the people of Metropolis and he finds out that he can go faster than he ever did before.  Lois leaves Clark for a job in Africa because she does not want to hurt him.  Clark gets a visit from Jonathan Kent and they talk about what is coming and Jonathan gives him encouragement that he will prevail.  Chloe uses the Fate helmet and gives herself as a trade for Oliver.  Carter goes to Africa to keep a eye on Lois as a favor to Clark and talks her to come back because Clark needs her.  Clark meets Brainiac 5 who shows Clark that he needs to let go of his guilt to move forward using the Legion ring because Brainiac 5 is from the future.  Tess finds a Lex clone and brings him home to love him and name him Alexander.  Clark tells Lois his secret and they grow in their relationship and he realizes that Lois saved him by removing the dagger from him.  Clark finds himself in a parallel universe when he uses a mirror box and changes places with another Clark and sees what it would be like in an upside down world where he is a Luthor and Lionel is still alive and Lois does not love him but is with Oliver.  Clark gets displaced again when the other Clark uses the mirror box and sends Clark to his world and Jonathan Kent tries to kill him until Clark convinces him that he is not the same Clark.  Carter gives his life to save Lois and at the funeral all the people are rendered unconscious.  Chloe comes back and every is freed from virtual reality where they could lose their powers when she plugs in to get them out.  Clark is the only one who has a hard time believing that he is in the real world and has to find his trust in Chloe again before it is too late.  Clark learns that he has to disguise himself to be able to save people in the spotlight so Clark becomes the disguise.  Clark and Oliver get sent to the Phantom Zone and find Zod there in his body where he makes Clark and Oliver fight but Clark is able to use that as a distraction to get Zod's crystal to escape the zone.  Lois gets a chance to have Clark's power when Jor-El gives her powers so she can understand what Clark goes through.  The final episode has Chloe reading the Smallville story to her son.  Lois and Clark are getting ready for the wedding and read each others vows which is them the strength to go through with the wedding but just when Lois is putting the ring on Clark, Chloe notices that it is made from gold kryptonite which would take away all of Clark's powers forever and knocks it out of Lois' hand.  Oliver turns on Clark but he is able to bring him back from the darkness.  Clark sees his father again and he gives Clark the suit and Clark finally learns how to fly.  Clark goes to the top of the Daily Planet and changes into the suit and in the background the Superman theme plays.  This is a great addition to the Smallville collection.",1504483200,,3100,4.174789915966387

4143270,4,B003L77GG0,"So,its a given that Smallville ended its run in 2011 and 6+ years later writing this isn't likely to offer any ground breaking insights.  But, what the heckI began as a casual viewer the first couple seasons catching episodes when convenient.  Having grown up with the old George Reeves black & white TV program in the early 60s and reading the occasional comic book, I like many find the Kryptonian visitor an appealing character.  The premise of Smallville taking a deep dive into the formative years of Clark Kent and how he developed into Superman is an engaging one.  A charismatic cast of young, attractive actors to bring it all to life proved to be a recipe for success as 10 seasons certainly proves.  Unfortunately about midway through the 2nd season deployments, a couple moves, and cutting the cord to cable Smallville dropped off my radar.  Still, there was enough substance to make me wonder how it all ended so recently decided to just cut to the chase and watch the 10th and final season.

  Skipping season 3 through 9 didn't really impair my enjoyment of watching the tenth.  Lana was gone but like many I didn't miss her whining.  Lex and Lionel Luthor pretty much gone (apart from some alternate dimensional cross visiting).  Pete, also no longer with us and Im not clear what became of him but OK.  Ive never watched Arrow but seeing him in action as a regular explains why he got his own show in 2012 and its still in production; Justin Hartley is a convincing playboy/hero in his own right.  Chloe is still with us and while not a favorite of mine she fulfills a stabilizing role amongst the heroes (yep, theres more than just The Man of Steel and Green Arrow); mediates between Lois and Clark and runs The Watchtower too.  Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman, recently in Longmire) was new to me after such a long break with the show.  Apparently shes an illegitimate daughter of Lionel Luthor whos now running much of the Luthorcorps empire along with Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) while trying to help the heroes all the while adjusting to her recent discovery of her heritage.

  Erica Durance as Lois Lane is perfect.  Pretty, spunky, smart (did I mention pretty?) she is probably my favorite in this role or a close tie with Teri Hatcher from Lois & Clark.  Previous on screen versions of Lois were not very convincing (Margot Kidder- annoying and not all that attractive; Kate Bosworth- blonde, lacked the vitality one expects of the gregarious Lois).  Too often made the damsel in distress Durance makes the most of it anyway and fits the part of a worthy girlfriend to a superhero without being constantly needy.

  Tom Welling sure looks the part of Superman and does a good job with the material hes given.  No doubt it would be a challenge to accept the magnitude of such powers and decide how best to use them.  Unfortunately the writers and showrunners have opted to have Clark Kent wallowing in angst and self-doubt seemingly forever.  10 years in and this guy still lacks self confidence and resolve; honestly its hard to believe.  When the series debuted show creators vowed no tights, no flights and that made sense; young Clark had to earn his stripes as it were and part of the appeal of the series was watching how he got there.  However, you're telling me after stringing the audience along all these years we have to wait until the last episode to finally see him in the iconic Superman suitwhy?  The whole The Blur persona Clark adopts is just dumb by this point except for the fact that they still won't let him fly. His cousin Supergirl can fly but Clark (other than once in an alternative universe) cant do it.  He must have asbestos shoes with all that super speed running around.  Finally, making Kryptonite in its various forms (green, red, blue, etc.) so damn ubiquitous that nearly everybodys got some meteor rock in their pocket gets old.  Clarks got powers but they're so often neutralized by some evil doer who just happens to have some K on them that really this Supermans more a Man of Pudding than of steel.  Maybe he should just relocate where the meteor didn't land and fight crime from there?

  Theres a lot of romance going on which seems excessive.  Weve got Chloe and Oliver, then theres Lois and Clark engaged and getting married, theres Tess and Emil, maybe and Aquaman and Mera, and I forget who else.  Of course Lois dated Oliver, and she date Aquaman, and others- the girl got around is all Im saying.  All of this leads to lots of goo-goo eyed gazes and lengthy soliloquies about who loves who and not a whole lot of crime fighting.  Clearly the production team was trying to keep the female demographic engaged.

  The finale provides the closure that long time fans deserved having Clark Kent put on the suit and become Superman.  After saving the earth from the Apokolips and now finally flying we see Clark back at the Daily Planet in his lame disguise.  Theres another emergency and now bumbling Clark heads to the roof, tosses aside his glasses and runs to the camera ripping open his shirt exposing the iconic S on his suit accompanied by the majestic John Williams Superman theme from the old Superman the Movie and that's the final shot.  If you're a fan, it doesnt get any better than that.  Glad I took the time to reconnect and see the how it wrapped up.",1498176000,2,5330,4.625133120340788

4143381,5,B003L77GG0,"All I can say is wow!!.  This show is epic!!  No other Superman show or movie can compare to the greatness of Smallville.  Infact no other superhero show can compare either.  Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed guaranteed.",1479945600,4,1223,4.6

4143507,3,B003L77GG0,"I realize now that I made a mistake reviewing season nine and spoiled this one. But I'll say it again: the finale felt rushed and Darkseid, the show's final villain, is beaten in a strange and honestly disapointing way. I also found Lex's final scene odd and contradictory. The very end removes a bit of the sting, if not much.",1475712000,,327,4.466666666666667

4143514,5,B003L77GG0,"I've loved Smallvillr since it began. Some seasons were better than others, but the stories always carried the saga onward. The tenth season was a little darker than I would have liked, especially towards the end, right up to the ""Finale"". But that last episode, along with ""Homecoming"", ""Isis"", and ""Harvest"" made the season. Erica Durance was a delight as Lois Lane, as always. Sometimes she was just downright so cute.

4143609,5,B003L77GG0,I love the smallville seasons but 1 thing that I have noticed is that if you buy seasons from amazon instant  is that when you watch it the first time you get the whole season. But when you watch it again and {this goes for any shows or movies} there are parts of the movie missing. For an example the first time I watch seasons 1-10 they averaged about 45 minutes apiece and the 2nd somewhere between 40 and 43 minutes. I will never buy another movie or series from instant again.,1472774400,,481,4.228260869565218

CW went all out and brought the biggest bad guy and villain group in the whole DC Universe. Spoilers ahead if you read on.... The big bad of season 10 was none other than Darkseid and the evil New Gods of Apokolips. Darkseid is quite literally the god of all evil. He brings a few of his evil minions along to battle Clark and then let the games begin.

4143792,2,B003L77GG0,"Bought on Amazon. Hate Callum Blue. Thoroughly sick of that Ice Palace. Poor Tom looks pallid from being in sunless Vancouver too long. Bad plots with too many sappy speeches cum psychobabble. I think that the budget must have been cut; so, action was replaced with boring dialogue as filler. I had to fast forward through these speeches. I was hoping for something great in the finale, but I was disappointed. All those persons in the features don't seem too bright if this is the best they can do. Tom is not even shown in his Superman suit. Legend says that his mom made it. Got rid of Kara easily. Cat is an annoyance as usual. I could never figure out Tess' agenda. She does strange things with no seeming ultimate purpose. Notice that it never snows in Smallville. It rained once on prom day. How can Tom live in that barn with gaps between the boards in the walls and even in the roof? At least I did not have to abide old piss-and-moan Lana.",1465603200,,949,4.3977272727272725

Darkseid is threatening Earth and Apokolips(Darkseid's planet) is now in Earth's solar system. Clark cannot even fully fly yet! This series is about Superboy becoming Superman with many guest star heroes like Flash, Arrow(not the current actor however), and even villains like Doomsday(you read that right!), Darkseid, and of course, Lex Luthor. You will see the first staredown between Lex and Superboy and they then declare themselves to be enemies after a long childhood friendship. You will also see Lionel Luthor's(Lex Luthor's dad) posession by Darkseid and the battle that takes place where Kal-El first learns to fly regularly. However, the fight still is not over because the planet Apokolips is now only miles from Earth's orbit and is causing massive tidal waves and earthquakes worldwide. You will see the first time Clark/Kal-El wears the Superman costume and even hear the movie theme from the Christopher Reeve days. COMIC BOOK HISTORY on the screen! If you have ever picked up and read a comic book in your life, this is a MUST HAVE. Very high quality special effects. No ""cheesy"" here.",1433116800,,1276,5.023584905660377

I remember I almost died after jumping from a high platform and hit my back head to the ground after shouting out ""I am Superman!"" when I was at elementary school. I even thought I could fly then. I wonder if someday someone will become a super hero like Superman. No one can run fast, jump high, fly up in the air, dodge bullet, or lift a bullet train like holding an apple on his hand, but Superman. I admire the story of this concept. He is always my hero and idol.",1419638400,,496,4.02020202020202
4145329,5,B003L77GG0,"Season Ten brings us a fantastic finale to what was, and is, a FANTASTIC series ... it is worth having in your collection,

Yes, I hear you, All ten years of Smallville are fabulous, and if you can, get all ten, whether you buy them or borrow them from the library, and watch them in order.

With ten years, the producers, directors and actors were able to take the time to develop all the characters, and give Clark a chance to learn the many lessons that he needed to learn in order to become a good Superman. He doesn't even put on the Supersuit until the last episode of the last season, though we do see Superman in his Cape during a few time-travel or alternate-universe episodes.

The entire series is wonderful. If you read any of the comic books over the years, or if you believed that Man could Fly when you first watched Christopher Reeve years ago, then do yourself a favor and buy or borrow every season of this excellent set.

P.S. If you're lucky like me, and live in an area with a cooperative county library system, you can buy the entire set and never open it. My county library is connected with 18 other libraries, and between them, they have all ten seasons, so I'm watching them all without having to open my set.

4145386,1,B003L77GG0,"As a Smallville fan since season 1, it pains me to give this final season of my favorite TV show a bad rating but...for me, this was not a satisfying conclusion to the series at ALL. They managed to get just about every major character to make a cameo in the series finale, except Lana. What gives?!? She's been there since day 1 and the writers/producers didn't bother allowing her fans to say goodbye? To me, that is just a stab in the back for longtime fans and indicative of the show's overall treatment of Lana's character. From the perpetual damsel in distress to marrying Clark's sworn enemy Lex, it seems like the writers could never find a creative storyline for Lana that didn't in some way involve Clark, and when they finally ""empowered"" her, it was ultimately to save Clark and forced her to leave the show. I will never forgive Smallville for underusing and mistreating the magnificent Kristin Kreuk.",1417132800,2,914,4.683229813664596

This season definitely surpasses both 8 and 9 in writing and it is the best send off of our favorite superhero. They bring back many of the cast that have come and gone in previous seasons, especially my favorite character Lionel Luthor, and they also put in a foe worth watching.

after the DVR I had saved the original broadcast on was erased by accident.

But around 5 or 6 it got good again.  Then around 8 or 9 it sucked again.  10, the last season, sucked too.  That's why I didn't watch it till I decided to complete my collection recently.  I had the first 8 seasons.  Might as well complete my collection.  I'm glad I did, because I got to watch a whole bunch of episodes that were new to me.  They weren't as bad as I thought they'd be, but still not as good as when the show started.  Heck, after 3 seasons, I'm sure you run out of ideas then get more later on.  That's probably what happened.  I didn't watch half of season 10 on TV, nor did I download it on a sharing network like I did for 8 and 9.  I did however watch the final episode.  Couldn't miss that one!  One thing I didn't like was in the last episode, they didn't really show Clark close up in the full Superman suit.  All those scenes were from afar and computer rendered I'm sure.  I'm not happy about that and remember not liking that when it first aired on TV.",1385942400,,1140,3.8995633187772927

4146005,4,B003L77GG0,"I've been binge watching this show and I admit that is functionally cheesy and over the top. The acting is often ham fisted, the writing is predictable and repetitive. The camera work falls somewhere between utilitarian and lazy. All that being said, as a superman fan I can't think of any other TV show about Supes that is this enjoyable. Of course some episodes and seasons are better than others. I've enjoyed season 10 as we Clark gets closer and closer to putting on the full get up. The episode in which he meets himself in the future is great. Some of the actors do a good job with the quagmire of exposition they're given. Other actors just remind us how poorly written things are with their over acting and wide eyed emoting. I'm looking at you Hawkman. Still it's fun to see superman and other of my favorite heros in action.",1377734400,,835,4.5

4146007,3,B003L77GG0,"Smallville season (1-7) 5 stars, (8-9) 4 stars and season (10) I'll give it 3 stars, but it deserves  2.  After creators Al Gough and Miles Millar left, they couldn't keep up the full greatest that the show originally had, but did 2 pretty good seasons (8-9). Season 10  had significantly shown poor quality for episode ideas and keeping up with the series. In my opinion the writers didn't know how to end the series, so they came up with a lot of random episodes and then gave us a pretty crumby series finale. I would say about 10 episodes are actually good though, but the series  finale was not one of them. The first hour of the finale was a little boring dragging on about  Lois and clarks vows as they recite them In there mind and so on. During the finale there was a giant planet or sun coming to earth, but during the last hour it stayed a float in the air over Smallville until the very end when a little dot ( Clark as superman catches it). I thought that the producers where very cheap in showing Clark in the superman suit and most of the time either showed a very very small superman or just a close up of clarks face with the sky in the back ground. I don't understand why they couldn't create some great moments fully showimg him in the suit when in the past they always showed great superhero special effects. I was really excited after the season 9 finale that in season 10 he was going to be superman but it did not happen. Smallville is still one of the greatest shows of all time, even though season 10 was a let down.",1376784000,,1541,4.2457337883959045
4146038,3,B003L77GG0,"After 10 seasons you are all excited to see Clark finally become Superman, and while the story was fun and the plot built up towards a big final ending, the ending itself was disappointing. It builds up until the last minute, and then the final battle and series end is over in literally minutes it seemed. I felt the creators suddenly realized they were out of time and had to rush everything to complete it within the episode count or something.

Either way, I would have picked this up because I had watched the other 9 seasons and I would have felt annoyed until I saw the finale but I'm glad I didn't buy it at it's higher price and waited for the price to drop down (plus I caught it on a sale and only paid $15 for it). It is also a plus that they did a decent enough job filling in plot holes before the finale so there wasn't much left that kept you wondering.",1376611200,2,869,4.1726190476190474

4146045,2,B003L77GG0,"The Final Season of ""Smallville"" was such a disappointment that I don't know where to begin to describe the pathetic and miserable season it was. First off, having almost all the ""dead"" characters (e.g. Lex and Lionel Luthor, Jonathan Kent) return was expected since they were integral to the show, but did anyone notice Lana Lang did not return to the final season's episode? True, she does have kryptonite infused in her body on the show, but at least show her from a distance or something. Her disappearance in the final episode cast a dark cloud and did not bring resolution to the show. Did Kristin Kreuk not want to be a part of the final season/episode? Hmm... Second, the villain, Darkseid, was introduced as a puff of black smoke. Ridiculous. In the comics and the animated series, he's not a puff of black smoke, but gigantic, ""flesh"", and intimidating. To introduce Darkseid as a puff of black smoke was disrespectful to the fans of this legendary/cult show. What were the writers smoking? It's no wonder, since Alfred Gough and Miles Millar left the show after season 7. Third, season 10, as well as season 8 and 9, could have been more if Bruce Wayne/Batman's character was introduced (just like most of the other Justice League members were introduced, except Green Lantern and Wonderwoman). Since Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent have history in the comics/animated films/etc. it would have been nice to see that on this show during the final 3 seasons. Yes, I realize ""Smallville"" is about Clark Kent, but since Green Arrow, Flash, and Aquaman were introduced, why not Bruce Wayne/Batman? It doesn't make sense.
What an awful ending to such an amazing show. If I were part of the production department, this show would have rocked in seasons 8-10. Oh well, too bad for the producers/writers of ""Smallville"" seasons 8-10. Their mundane writing and production for this show during the last 3 seasons ruined this show.",1374624000,2,1925,4.854103343465046

4146047,4,B003L77GG0,"The ""bad guys"" of this season felt a little overdone to me, mostly because the main one is not really seen in any meaningful way, it's just always there in the background. With that said, this season was a very satisfying conclusion to the Smallville saga, with just enough of the ""old"" Clark Kent from Season 1 and just enough of the ""new"" Clark Kent and his friends that we've seen in the ensuing seasons to keep fans familiar with the feel of the storytelling while adding a new dimension to the Superman mythology.",1374537600,,518,4.5212765957446805

4146090,3,B003L77GG0,"This was a muddled finale season to an otherwise strong series.  After an amazing Season 8 and 9 with Doomsday and Zod, the overarching plot theme this season is a mysterious darkness that must be battled.  Not fully developed, this darkness randomly overtakes people and turns them evil against their will.  The evil's final action is oddly disconnected from every episode in the season, and the evil earthly minions are killed rather easily in the finale (super lame).  Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan is in only a handful of episodes, and her presence is sorely missed.  The ongoing thread of the anti-vigilante movement doesn't make sense AT ALL because the heroes are saving people, not taking criminal justice into their own hands.  The writers work hard to try to make it work throughout the entire season, but it simply doesn't.  Like the darkness theme, you just have to pretend it works and move on.  The whole second Lionel plot is also super ridiculous.

On the positive side of some lame plots, it's fun to see so many actors returning (why no redemption for Pete Ross, however?), particularly Annette O'Toole and John Schneider.  There are some outstanding episodes among the mix (the one where Lois gets caught in a cult is really fun), and there are elements to the finale episode that wrap things up nicely.

It's also worth noting, for people of faith out there, that the writers take on a decidedly anti-Catholic/Christian perspective in this season and push it from beginning to end.  I'm not talking about them taking a stance again religion but attacking their followers.  One ongoing villain is named Godfrey, and his biggest supporter listens to Amy Grant and is perpetually perky.  The Darkness has chosen ones that he chooses for himself to live eternally after the darkness ""rapture"" day.  That's a short list.  In thinking of people I know, it was more than mildly offensive.

Overall, this isn't the worst season of SMALLLVILLE (skip Season 4 entirely), but after the build-up of Seasons 8 and 9, it's disappointing.  At the same time, if you've been with the series through the good and the bad, you'll want to see this final season even though it is one of the weaker ones.",1373846400,6,2203,4.8293333333333335

4146095,5,B003L77GG0,"This was truly a great season, the greatest season in my opinion.  What better way to start off Superman's career than this?  Of all the origin stories out there, I find this show has done it the best thus far.  Throughout all the seasons there were some definite misses (as nothing will ever be perfect, especially the vampire bat episode), but I think Tom Welling's version of Clark hit the nail on the head.  He was able to play Clark as the vulnerable guy wrestling with his ""human"" emotions in a modern world (which we love to see, e.g., ""Year One,"" etc.), yet also able to give us the ""mask"" Clark, with the stumbling, bumbling, clumsy act - which I find a lot of the newer origin stories disappointingly lack.  One of my favorite scenes is Clark being nervous and asking for the bathroom due to a milkshake he had earlier -- CLASSIC!  He also was totally against killing, unlike the ""Man of Steel"" movie (which I found to be a completely disappointing move by the screenwriters of the movie).  The writers of ""Smallville"" definitely gave us the best of both pre-Crisis and post-Crisis Superman origins. The rest of the cast and plots are great too, especially the V.R.A subplot.  SUPER-COOL.  Loved Green Arrow.  Loved Hawkman.  Loved the ""Earth 2"" plots.  Loved Lois Lane.  Chloe rocked!  Lex, Lionel, Tess... It's all there!

As you can tell, I'm a fan.  I definitely recommend this season as well as any other ""Smallville"" season.

I'm also glad they continued the story with the Season 11 comics/graphic novels...",1372809600,,1524,4.712121212121212

4146133,5,B003L77GG0,"I think it was overall, a really good wrap up to a different view of an American Icon. It was never supposed to be about Superman...but instead,  Clark Kent's life, as an average American teenager, who just happens to be fated to become the greatest superhero ever...he has to cope with things ever teenager has to face..being accepted, finding his place in the world, unrequited love...heart break..personal responsibility...as well as being a demi god among men. Having so of the stars involved with previous visions of The Man of Steel, added a nice blending of several of the Superman legend....The people portraying the characters...those we know, and the new comers, such as Allison Mack's ""Chloe Sullivan"" did an incredible job, in my opinion. Having Christopher Reeve (God rest his soul) doing a recurring role up until his unfortunate passing was a major feather in the cap of everyone involved in the production...not to mention Terrance Stamp, who went from being Krypton's greatest villain, to the voice of Jor-el...and so many others...

I really love Smallville but this was inexcusable. before i finished the 10th season i looked up a review of it thinking people were just being stupid I finished the last few episodes i was on last night and it was just dumb beyond all means his Superman costume looked stupid. It never said what became of Lex or A clear shot of Clark in the Superman costume. For some reason a lot of the time spent in costume was C.G.I.  W T F?
It was just disappointing. Then when you actually do see him in costume its just his chest and it looks SO STUPID! I mean really 10 season or AKA 10 years just to see that how pathetic! I really loved Smallville but this just didn't do it justice at all. I hope they make a movie based off the hit television series to do justice to this amazing show! R.I.P.

4146289,5,B003L77GG0,"Being a super-hero fan and especially a Superman fan, I didn't expect much from this show.  I never saw this show until recently.  Thinking it was a show for teenagers, I avoided it altogether during it`s entire run.

I purchased season 10 and expected to be let down and have a couple of laughs.  Watching Tom Welling as the title character, I was quite surprised that he came off as sincere and genuine.  I just hope his fame in this decade long story doesn't go to his head and spoil his performance in any future projects.  He should have been The Man of Steel in the new film.  Why he or the producers didn't choose him, I don't know.  Perhaps he fears typecasting.  Tom has a sensitivity and humanity that I haven't seen in any of the recent actors.  The actor in Bryan Singer's film and the new one for Zack Snyder's  adaptation look very pale in comparison.

I was impressed with the array of super characters in the show. If it wasn't for the ""meteor freaks"" there wouldn't be much in the way of adversaries for Superman to battle.  I did miss the presence of Lex Luthor in this season up until we see him in the series finale.  If there is a Smallville movie; the actor who plays Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum, has to be part of it.  If  you a fan of Superman, you've got to check this out.  It's because of this season, I am ordering the remaining nine seasons to watch.  It's a keeper! It's the kind of show that rewards the viewer with multiple viewings.  The episodes are well crafted and written with the comic book fans in mind.  There are all types of obscure references to Superman mythology that only the fans will pick up.  And that makes the show all the more better!",1364169600,,1688,4.363344051446945

No more Lana, and now in this season Lois and Clark are center stage. Although there might be some bumps along the way: an evil Lionel Luthor (I know, shocking right? Who would have guessed), more alternate worlds, and even more episodes of Clark losing his power, etc. Overall this season hits the mark on so many levels. The season finale will make everyone jump for joy, and then pound their fist for more! Luckily Amazon has season 11 at .99 cents an issue!

This season isn't the worst, that honor goes to the shortened (and woefully written) season 7, plagued by the writers strike.  What really gets me going about this season is the obvious desire the producers had in cutting costs.  For a series that became popular for its action, the tenth season is all talk.  In season 1 & 2 you couldn't go two episodes without a car explosion.

The ultimate betrayal for this -10 DVD season owning- fan was the finale.  As like the rest of the season, this last episode was basically Clark and Louis chatting for 42 minutes.

We wanted to watch the series finale on broadcast TV, but something came up and we missed it.  So, to see it we got it from Amazon Prime.

The flying sequences were obviously CGI (it doesn't have a movie budget), but if you watch closely, you'll never see Supe in the entire suit.  You will only see a portion of him in the suit at one time.  I'm thinking that they didn't want to spend money to put together a suit that would like good in a full body shot, so they only had him with a shirt.  That was a little disappointing, but the series finale was good.",1358985600,,769,4.190476190476191

Episode 1: Darkseid possesses Glen Beck.  No one can tell the difference.
Episode 2: Catherine Grant enters the Smallville universe, where she promptly transmogrifies into Sarah Palin.
Episode 4: Brainiac moves directly to Brainiac 5 without passing Go or collecting $200.
Episode 6: Religion is evil!  Just ask the Children of the Corn.  No, wait, Lois has faith!  In, erm, something.
Episode whatever: Colonel Tigh loses his eye.
Episode 10:  It's NOT the Star Trek mirror universe!  It's not!  It's, um, Earth-3, yeah, that's the ticket.
Episode 11: They killed Kenny!
Episode 12: Chloe morphs into Morpheus (from ""The Matrix"", not from ""The Sandman."")
Episode 15: Oliver Queen looks surprisingly attractive as a Las Vegas showgirl.  Note to self: a shaven chest makes speedy transvestitism possible.
Episode 16: Lex Luthor II transmogrifies into Conner Kent.
Episode 18: Booster teaches Jaime how to use his Beetle.  Ted Kord fails to make anything resembling a joke.
Episode 19: In the Phantom Zone, phantoms can kill each other.  This never happened in the comics because they're, ya know, phantoms, and all.
Episode 20: Lois: I don't want to get married anymore.

Finale:
Lois: I still don't want to get married anymore.
Clark: We're getting married.
Chloe: You should get married.
Lois: Yes, we should get married.
Clark: Maybe you're right, maybe we shouldn't get married.
Lois: No, I changed my mind, let's get married.
The wedding ceremony starts.
Story happens, interrupting the ceremony.
Story gets resolved.  (Oh, by the way, he's finally Superman now.)
Epilogue: 7 years later, they're still not married (wait, what?)  But they're about to get married.  In other news, the Metropolis bridge is for sale.",1357344000,3,1753,5.210714285714285

4146596,4,B003L77GG0,"I watched this hoping for a triumphant end.  Of course all the cost cutting and rushed storylines did this in. Dark died is an epic villain and got the Galactus cloud treatment by never seeing him. Lionel's double had solo much promise as did Lex returning. I think this show went on too long and burnt out. I so wanted to see Welling in full suit mode and got a neck shot with cape, a CGI doll for Superman and then Luthor  all but a zombie clone at the end. The use of John Williams at the end and Clark finally ripping his shirt open should have come years earlier. I hung through Small ville since the start and wished the CW had listened to fans and pulled out all the stops this season. All in all the DVD set is well made and should please the hard core fans.",1357171200,,766,4.1

4146684,3,B003L77GG0,"The 10th and last season of Smallville was nowhere near the level of the 9th one and that was too bad. Still, it was very enjoyable, with some great classics like  "" Homecoming "",  "" Lazarus "", "" Abandoned "" and the best of the lot  "" Booster "". Those episodes were among the best of the series. But there were some awful ones too. "" Isis "", "" Harvest ""  and the lame  "" Fotune "" comes to mind. The finale was okay. I was deceived that the Darkseid plot line was kind of put on the back burner for the coming of age of Clark and the series's finale. There was so much to be done here! After all, the greatest vilain of all-time of the DC universe was on board! I guess it was just not meant to be! Maybe if they had not wasted 5-6 years of the show on Lana Lang...

Ah well, that's life, I guess! Still, all in all, very enjoyable. Just not as good as the 9th season. Enjoyed!

Concerning the S & H, thanks for everything! The delivery was in time and in perfect order. Really appreciated the professionalism and the diligence of your company. Impeccable! Thanks again!",1356566400,,1069,4.1352657004830915

I really enjoyed it and I think that Smallvile: Season 10 is my favorite. Great journey and a wonderful capstone. I'd recommend this for anyone that enjoyed Smallville or that wants a dose of superheroes without directly have super hero elements. So much of this series is as much about the personal stories as about the super hero and fantasical.",1355961600,,507,4.644444444444445

4146834,3,B003L77GG0,"I bought this DVD set to finish out my collection of all 10 seasons and liked the picture/color quality about as much as anything in the season. The series may have gone on too long for it's own good, I think the writing really began slipping with the conclusion of the high school years (which season was that?). Someday I'll get around to watching this set, probably won't ever go Blu-ray unless it's really cheap and covers all 10 seasons.
It's been months since I looked my set over but I think #10 even had the weakest set of extras of the series.",1354060800,,552,4.368932038834951
4146835,5,B003L77GG0,Smallville is one of my most favorite series of all time. I loved what they did with the Superman icon and it helped bring a lot of questions to a close that the movies could never do. The 10th season also was greatly inspiring and a smooth transition to the hero we have all come to love in the comic books and movies.,1353801600,,319,4.079365079365079
4146836,5,B003L77GG0,I would recommend getting the tenth season especially if you enjoy watching Smallville. It's the last season in the series. Clark finally becomes Superman. Disappointed in CW for ending the series.,1353715200,,197,5.387096774193548

4146839,5,B003L77GG0,Looked forward to the ending and it exceeded all of my expectations. Having Lex Luthor come back was great and I miss Tess already. Lois and Clark are meant to be together always. Will buy the complete series when I can afford it and thanks.,1351728000,,241,4.377777777777778

4146952,4,B003L77GG0,"The finale was a two-parter, and On Demand only offered the first part.  I got impatient and watched it here for a very small fee.  It is a fairly fitting ending to the long story of the series, and an interesting take on the journey of young Clark to the moment he became Superman in all respects.  If you haven't seen the ending, watch it.",1350086400,,341,4.2153846153846155

We got to grow with young Kal-El, we went hand in hand through ten years of trials and new abilities... and finally he has come unto himself: A gorgeous reporter witha nerdy hairstyle and thick Buddy Holly glasses, a mild stutter... and oodles of charisma to go with it all. We enjoy the image of a mature superhero in his late twenties, at peace and in love... and fighting the greatest evil in the universe as a final rite of passage. Clark is no longer the Blur... he is the Man of Steel!
This season has some awsome drama, unexpected turns, memories of the past, high school flashbacks, two weddings, love, sex, villains and heroes... and the very anticipated return of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to consolidate himself as superman's greatest adversary in the future. And of course.... flying.

4147082,3,B003L77GG0,"Without including spoilers, I would like to say that this was a great series in the Superman mythology.  I really appreciated the time taken to research the history of the story and come  up with compelling, updated story lines. This season, the writing staff seemed to know where they wanted to go, a wedding between Clark and Lois. As a viewer, this was pathetic.  It had been done before at least 3 times in the series and this particular wedding was the most boring of them all.  The final episode was VERY self-indulgent through a boring montage of past episodes and didn't address some of the most interesting plot-lines. What happened to LANA?!?!
This box set is actually pretty good, however.  The season in entirety is very well done.
I'm not sad I watched it because I have enjoyed the series so much.  I'm just left with a disappointed taste in my mouth from the conclusion episode.",1345075200,,893,4.656050955414012

It was the perfect ending to a ten year run, each disc makes you relive the last moments of this spectacular show.  The Blur and Green Arrow, made this show a must see for me. I think it was more of a science fiction series than your usual Superman, with all the special effects, aliens, and new gadgets they introduced all the time. Of Course, there was the romance between Clark Kent (Tom Welling) and Lois Lane (Erica Dorrance) that developed much further in this series than any other movie or series before it, they were the best episodes of all, especially the fact they let them finally get married.

The return of Jonathan Kent and the Luthors it really was a season true fans can appreciate!! The only bad thing was the company Amazon got the set from. Warehouse Detail buyers beware!!

The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.

The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.

I have enjoyed the entire series and would recommend the Smallville series to any and all who like Superman.

Sure there were ups and down, the worst being the doldrums of the mid-series' Lex and Lana years (such a waste of Rosenbaum) but overall this has been spectacular. I grew up reading Superman comics and watching various TV and film adaptations and as much as I loved Christopher Reeve as Superman I have to say this series is the best take on the mythos - and I just spent the last few months watching Smallville from start to finish. Every show has it's dogs, but when Smallville was firing on all cylinders it was spectacular TV. And since this is the set-up to a boy becoming a man it truly is the journey and not the destination that is important. We all have our quibbles, I would have preferred Zod or Lex being the main villain in the final season, but when you see most of the abysmal dreck churned out on TV these days I'm happy with what we got here. To the critics on Amazon who said, ""That's it?"" in regard to the last SHOT of the series, clearly, they didn't get it. Yes, that's IT, and real Superman fans will not only get it, but they'll love it.",1338681600,,1101,4.222748815165877

4147243,3,B003L77GG0,"Let me start off by saying when for the first four seasons, Smallville was my favorite show. It was still in my top five until season 8. And to my surprise, I still liked it after Lex left. But by season 9, it had run out of steam... and they just kept right on going. And that gets my goat a little. Most of this season seems like filler for the finale. I watched this season to see Clark become Superman. But that last episode is mostly Lois and Clark deciding if they are going to get married or not. Like some cheesy romance show. It's like they forgot who the original audience for the show was - largely young males. Then, to top it off, you don't even really get a good look at Welling as Superman. I personally felt robbed. I think the original integrity of the show was sacrificed in this so-so season.

On the plus side, though, It looks and sound great. The 1080p transfer looks better than a lot of TV shows I've seen on Blu Ray.

Welling and the other producers just should have known when to quit.",1334361600,4,1011,4.206185567010309

4147245,3,B003L77GG0,"Though it lagged in some episodes, Smallville in its whole is representative of nearly 80 years of testament to the human spirit. Equality, government, immigration, sharing of knowledge and technology - you name it, it has graced Superman-based anything through the character's life. Smallville was to be the story that was never told - what happened to change Clark Kent to the Man of Steel.

Despite episodic lag, Smallville grew into a heavy head of steam during seasons eight and nine. And we knew what it was leading up to: allowing us to believe a man can fly.

The only negative in the climatic Season Ten is when Clark dons the suit. We never get a good look, the character is far away in the distant frame, et al. The DC purist in me wants to give it Five Stars for accomplishing exactly what it set out to do, and the fact that by the by they did it well. Maybe the intent was for us to see Superman's initial appearances as the John Q. on the streets of Metropolis - faintly, a blur of colour, from a distance safe enough for a mortal to be generally assured survival without the rendering of aid. If that indeed was the intent (and no special features I've seen testify to that point), then bravo!

But the fanboy in me wanted to see something epic. Something worthy of a ten year old promise. The producers knew exactly where they were going to end up: Clark in the Suit. There was never any doubt. Quite simply, I was expecting something Super.

So please, do not take a mid-grade biased heavily by the series finale at face value. The series as a whole definitively averages four stars per episode, and Season Ten is inclusive to that.

The special features of this final season are on par with everything we've seen included so far: random commentary, occasional featurettes, and the like. But you didn't buy this DVD set for the extras. You bought it to see a man fly.

And at that, we almost do.",1333152000,2,1913,4.467048710601719

4147247,4,B003L77GG0,"Clark Kent faces his final challenge to finally become the Man of Steel in Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season. Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has come along way since his teenage years in Smallville High, and after years of struggling with the transition from boyhood to adulthood and forging his superhero identity, he is ready to jump into the spotlight as Earth's greatest protector. Unfortunately, a mysterious dark force has arisen, corrupting the minds of the populace and putting Clark and other superheroes in danger. With the help of Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Supergirl (Laura Vandervoort), the Justice League and his adoptive father Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), Clark will find the strength to overcome the darkness and embrace his fate. Smallville is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The tenth and final season is somewhat uneven, but still offers a satisfying finale to one of the longest running television series. The final season also marks the return of many popular characters including arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and amusing appearances of other DC characters.

The Blu-Ray edition of Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season won't be the highlight of your Blu-Ray collection, but fans of Smallville will be pleasantly pleased with its presentation and content. All 22 episodes of the final season are presented in 1.78 widescreen format. The picture quality surpasses those of previous high definition ""Smallville"" releases with its bright colors and solid contrast. Its DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track is quite excellent among television box sets. Its special features include audio commentaries with cast members and production crew on two episodes (Lazarus & Dominion), 4 minutes of deleted scenes and two featurettes (Back in the Jacket: A Smallville Homecoming & The Son Becomes the Father). Overall, Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season scores a ""B"".",1332201600,,2002,5.396166134185304

The show over it's ten years was great. While some say season ten might not be the best, I think every season had it's ups and downs. The only things I didn't like about season ten was Chole kept dissapearing for a few of the episodes, and we didn't get to see any of the Justice league guys come back for another team episode. All the returns of the past characters was great and it really helped the show have a nice conclusion. The finale as a whole was amazing. I had to watch it twice on my rental disc. Such a tear jerker and epic finish. Though they didn't show clark just standing around and talking in the suit, they showed him in it and flying which everyone has wanted since the show began. I started watching this show when it came out in 2001 and its hard to believe that it's actually over. I wish they would make a straight to dvd movie of it, but that's probably only wishful thinking. Either way, I will get the complete set on blu ray whenever it comes out and watch the whole show again many times over.

The whole Lex Luthor thing even seemed feasible....a bit of a stretch...but I was willing to go with it.  The episodes that followed in which they were trying to figure out how their relationship could work was the brightest spot of the whole season for me.

I even bought some of the music from it on itunes. When I got to this season, I couldn't wait to finally see superman. I was excited for the finale as I am sure any reader of this review would be.
I want to share my feelings about this season alone and hopefully it would help you decide whether or not to purchase it.

I would only recommend buying it if you are diehard like me. If you haven't seen ALL of the episodes before this season, I really mean ALL, you may not understand the ending. This season is about tying up all the loose ends from EVERY previous episode. The series had a lot of loose ends in it and you can tell in this season the writer's had to select their words very carefully to be consistent throughout the finale story. They pulled off the finale exceptionally well but if you don't have the big picture of the other seasons first, you may get lost and regret using your money buying this season.

If you watch movies and shows purely for entertainment purposes, you won't be disappointed. It is a very entertaining season. It has drama, humor, action, sexiness, and heartwarming moments. There are times where you will feel all emotions. There is one episode with Oliver Queen that I particularly think everyone would enjoy. I laughed so hard I am sure the neighbors a block away could hear.

This season is about darkness and love. Both are portrayed visually. I would not allow someone younger than 16 to watch this because some of moments are a little too grown up for kids any younger. That's my opinion though.

The bluray version, which I own, is probably not much better than the DVD version in terms of graphics and sound. You would be happy with either. I bought the bluray because I am a believer that bluray will last longer.

I had high hopes that it would go out with a bang. It was actually how expected it to be. I give it four stars because I had fun but really I don't think everyone who watches it will.",1328400000,5,2088,4.398963730569948
4147395,5,B003L77GG0,"For 10 years Smallville was a show I looked forward to and tried never to miss.  Some of the years were better than others; years 5 and 6 are particular standouts for me.  Some of the episodes were better than others.  All-in-all this last season did not disappoint.  The closer the end came, the harder the episodes must have been to write.

There are few instances in these last years of TV Dramas which showcase the development of a strong,young repertoire of characters.  The final season was a fitting prequel  to the original concept of SUPERMAN.

Adios, amigos, SMALLVILLE's conclusion as left a hole in my TV schedule, but I can revisit the series at will with the dvds.",1328313600,,678,4.638655462184874

I have a few complaints though.  I'll be a bit vague to prevent spoiling anything.

1) I have no idea what the heck was going on with Alison Mack.  They kept putting
her in and taking her out of the credits which would be fine if they did that with
all involved, but seems to be short changing her by not having her properly there
every time.

2) Kristin Kreuk only appear via flash back.

3) The solutions for Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen are lame.

4) The mirror box arc was mostly good, but some of the Dark Seid solutions, not so much.

4147495,5,B003L77GG0,I am so pleased with my order.  I am a huge Smallville fan and was pleased to finish my collection so quickly and easily.  The price was more than half that of most stores.  Package was still in plastic and brand new.  Another happy Amazon customer!,1327622400,,249,4.3478260869565215
4147496,5,B003L77GG0,"One of the weekly tv shows I made a point to watch, will always be on my favorites list. I miss the show, but can't complain because they gave us ten awesome years. Thanks Tom W. And the rest of the cast for sharing you talents with us all. Take care.",1327536000,,251,3.9411764705882355
4147497,5,B003L77GG0,The creators of Smallville did an incredible job to tie up the season finally. I love the season and the last episode.,1327536000,,118,4.409090909090909
4147498,5,B003L77GG0,This last season of Smallville was great. I love all the Smallville seasons. Getting this from Amazon saved me time and money.,1327276800,,126,4.7727272727272725
4147499,5,B003L77GG0,"Well, it seems that they knew that the end was coming, but it seems that it was sooner than they wanted it to be.  I am almost finished with this season and it seems that somethings are being rushed, like Clark becoming the Clark Kent from the movies, instead of the confident person that he is.  All and all, I liked it.",1327190400,,321,4.161290322580645
4147500,5,B003L77GG0,"this item shipped in the time estimated, and was exactly what i ordered. my husband was so excited to receive this as a christmas gift this year - now we have the entire series! :)",1327017600,,180,4.171428571428572
4147601,4,B003L77GG0,"The product was excellent and a welcomed end. Seeing that Smallville was a pre-Superman time period, I was bothered by how the series continually limited his ability, stretched out his learning curve, and dumb down his intellect. The series was entertaining and disturbing at the same time. ""Somebody Save Me"" will always be a memorable tune.",1326844800,,342,5.125
4147602,4,B003L77GG0,"Smallville has had its ups and downs in its ten year run.  It seemed to struggle the most in the middle seasons, but the later seasons picked things back up again.  The final season for Smallville is still one of the better ones. The things that made Smallville great are still present: Lois and clark's fantastic chemistry, fun cameos from DC characters, good overarching storylines, and use of the Superman mythology. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to shake off the problems that have often been an issue in Smallville.  Some soap opera-esque drama, poor cgi, and anticlimactic conclusions to story arcs.  Season 10's best moments are when it begins moving Clark closer to becoming Superman. Seeing him wearing the glasses doing the dorky Clark Kent routine is just great. Lois and Clark's growing relationship is so much fun to watch.  (I think Erica Durance is my favorite actress who has portrayed Lois.). There are some really great episodes in this season, with a few ones that are homages to other movies ( including the hangover, the matrix, and thunderdome). Obviously the main draw of any show's final season is to see how it ends. The finale here is a microcosm of the entire series, it's a mix of great and dissapointing moments.  The resolving of the season-long story is quick and completely underwhelming.  (what about all that talk where this would be Clark's greatest challenge?) You will see him in the suit, but it's a quick look so don't expect much there. The best parts of the finale are its scenes between Clark an Lois, and Clark with his family. The return of Lex Luther brings the series full circle and will be a cool moment for fans. The 7 years later final scene also pays some nice homages to the Superman films.  It may not have been a completely satisfying finale, but it hits a lot of things that will make fans happy.  It's not the greatest show made, but it's the show we love despite its flaws. If your a fan of Smallville and/or Superman you will enjoy the final season of Smallville.",1326758400,,2021,4.686440677966102

I just didn't have time to watch them so I bought the seasons when they came out on DVD and would watch them over the summer. I just recently bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend but it was for me as well :) We've watched the first 3 episodes so far and cannot wait to finish this epic final season!! Also it was a little cheaper to buy off amazon than in the store!!,1325808000,,517,4.078431372549019

4147772,5,B003L77GG0,"Smallville was a fantastic TV series from the the very first episode in 2001. The show did nothing but get better all the way through Season 10. Smallville had outstanding special effects and its use of characters introduced on the show and actors and actresses from previous Superman movies and TV such as Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, Margot Kidder, Helen Slater and Terence Stamp as the voice of Jor-el was over the top. The final 2-hour Series Finale brought the whole 10 years together. The introduction of new stars such as Tom Welling, Kristen Kruek, Michael Rosenbaum, Erica Durance and Justin Hartley blended perfectly with more seasoned stars such as John Schneider, Annette O'Toole and John Glover. The use of the Superman musical score by John Williams and the new Smallville theme by Remy Zero completed the package. You don't have to be Superman fan to enjoy this DVD collection. I'm terribly sorry it's over but it set a standard for others to follow.",1325289600,,980,4.909638554216867

I wish I would have checked out their site first, I could have saved 6.00. Amazon usually has the best price. Would be great if they refunded me the difference but I doubt they will. I loved Smallville and the whole series was entertaining. Season 10 was a decent ending to a great show. Too bad they wouldn't come up with a Justice League series with all the super heroes that were on Smallville.",1324771200,,572,4.355140186915888

However, once I began watching the series, my attitude changed and I was hooked. Smallville, I think, gives us a little insight on what it was like for Superman trying to grow up as a regular kid. I would highly recommend the series.",1324512000,,367,4.661538461538462
4147832,2,B003L77GG0,"If you are looking for the well written, well produced, and well directed episodes from the early years of this acclaimed series you probably won't find it in this loose collection of bizarre fairy tales.

This great series, which I anticipated with each new week, has taken a serious tumble in this jumble of nonsensical short stories. Many are rehashes of stories already told (must have run out of new ideas) and very few afford us more than a brief 45 minute glimpse, which ultimately provides the viewer with a shallow, under-developed story that is way too short to provide any depth to the characters or meaning to the story.  Previous years saw running story lines from one episode to the next that provided us with all the information we needed to become immersed in the story line and the characters, but this season seemed to be produced more for quantity and less for quality (courtesy of Mr. Welling who was the executive producer for the entire season).

Some of the ideas were just plain dumb,like the episode etitled ""Granny Goodness"", who appears as an evil and sinister old lady who is into S&M and keeps a bevy of scantilly clad ""torture girls who are into martial arts"".  I know this series is based on a comic book but this is lowering the bar too far.

Now for the biggest disappointment! If you, like I, have been watching this series faithfully and anticipating the moment when Clark actully learns to fly, then brace yourself for a quick three seconds of an ""animated"" sequence of a small indistinguishable figure zipping through the far horizon.

If you are a completist you definitely should purchase the collection, but do so knowing that if you enjoyed the series as much as I did, this season may not meet the high expectations it used to deserve.

On a positive note I enjoyed seeing Lex again (the show was never the same after he departed) but even he couldn't measure up to his old evil ways in the few minutes afforded him in the final episode.

Great series, very weak final season!",1324339200,3,2018,4.648876404494382
4147833,4,B003L77GG0,"This season really wraps up 10 years of story line. There are some really good episodes. The best is an episode you could call ""The Smallville Hangover"". It is very funny, and just like the movie ""The Hangover"". Another episode, directed by Justin Hartley (aka Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) is probably the best episode of the season. The only reason I say that it isn't as good as season 9 is that they linger on one topic (I won't say what, as not to ruin it for ya'll) for TOO MANY EPISODES. There are some surprise guest stars, and some surprise 'blasts from the past'. If you are a true Smallville/Superman/DC fan, you will really get a kick out of this season. I DO recommend it. Just, don't be expecting it to be fantastic...If you ask me, Season Nine is the best season out of all of them. But Season 10 won't disappoint, as long as you don't expect it to be season 9.",1323907200,,872,4.355828220858895

4147838,1,B003L77GG0,"I watched Smallville off and on and here of the 10th season being there last. I bought seasons 1-9 and watched them until season 10 started,so I could catch up. Most of the early season so the same way every episode,so you probaly will get tired of watching them,like I did. Someone always gets knocked out and doesn't remember what happened the week before or the book The Art of War gets quoted alot by Lex or Lex's father and the constintly repeating scenes of conflict or make up to break up in one whole episode kinds of things get old. But season 1-9 were very fun and exciting to watched and season 9 was truly amazing with the JSA and all the other specail appearrances throughout.

But on to season 10. A very hard season to follow or want to follow. They clearly made this season for everyone from the original cast to come back to say there final goodbyes. Which was nice,even though most of it just seemed like a flip of a switch and there they are,so if you missed even the smallest parts of the episodes. You would be completely lost and with all the people comming back made alot of the episodes for this season seemed half assed or as if they just stopped caring about the show anymore,for example,an entire episode about a very rare bow that they spend an entire episode on,ends up getting destroyed the last 5 minutes of the show or the hangover episode.

Where everyone has to find out what happened the night before,which that episode was very lame. I also hate that that there was no main villian that has anything to do with the story at all. Just shadows of the actual person or clones or body switches instead of the clear cut villain like Lex or Zod were in the past. Darksied would just send his lackies to do most if not all his dirty work,which made him look like a giant pussy. It was like he had something better to do because it didn't seem like he got very involved in what was going on.

It all comes down to two things. After 10 season of constint focus was on the Clark Kent's character and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman ""the blur"" dynamic alittle. But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman ""the blur"" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives. But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing. I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly. Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.

To me it just seemed like they were giving the middle finger to all the superman fans,I always pictured superman being the strongest and most powerful hero out there,but in recent years in animation as well as live action,he would rather root for the Batmans or Green Arrow characters because for the least powerful characters they seem to fair alot better than Superman,who get controlled by the villian or knocked out or kidnapped or something stupid like that and in live action does extremely well only not do extremely badly later on.",1322611200,3,3250,4.503389830508475
4147839,5,B003L77GG0,"Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Tenth-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B003L77GGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray</a>] in addition to or in lieu of purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>.  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode ""Finale"" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.

Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;ultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode ""Homecoming""), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.

If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.

4147840,2,B003L77GG0,"As a long-time Smallville fan, the last season wrap-up of this decade long series is somewhat disappointing. A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through.  However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed.  The obvious ""blue-screen"" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment.  Other plot and character inconsistencies abound. The last season has a few golden moments, but they're planted like Easter egg gifts among an otherwise limited vision of one of our most enduring American heroes.",1322524800,,850,4.888888888888889
4147941,2,B003L77GG0,"First let me start by saying I loved Smallville. I watched my first episode in 2007 and quickly caught up with the previous episodes and currently own seasons 1-9. I loved that the writers tried to be as balanced and fair as possible. I also loved the energy of the show!

I missed the first two episodes, but made sure to catch Homecoming. I couldn't believe the direction the show was talking with its not-so subtle jabs at ""embracing illegal immigrants""  I was surprised, because the same sort of comment had been made in the previous episode too. Wasn't it Lois who said in season six, ""does breaking and entering not mean anything to rich people?"" But the message seemed to be that it's okay to enter another country as long as it's done by a someone living in poverty- then you don't need to follow the rules. I didn't like the overall disrespect that the military was given in this season. They were portrayed as villains' and I expected more balance.

I also expected a stronger story. I think the thing writers and producers of comics need to remember is that in fantasy/sci-fi a hero is only as credible as the villain. Replacing strong villains' like Doomsday, Zod, and Lex with a boorish, contrived and ghost-like character that preys on people like some evil little devil sitting on their shoulder is childish and insulting to the viewer.  There were also a few sloppy episodes that made me cringe. A bachelor party themed episode where they wake up and don't know what happened? It was so hard to watch them act drunk, and what was worse was the lines seemed like they were being made up as the actors went along.

Again, I would just urge people to think twice before purchasing this season. I'm glad I saw the epiodes I did, because I will not be buying this propaganda soap box season and the political bru ha ha that took away from the really genuine and beautiful relationship that Lois and Clark were finally able to have.

I would also love to see how that relationship ended, but the constant insinuation that only a corrupt individual would ask people to enter a country legally was just too much. My Grandmother came to this country legally at time when her country was at war and everyone was starving, yet she still managed to enter the US by abiding all laws. To suggest that its' okay to just enter a country, because ""they only want the opportunities that you and your family have"" (As Oliver's lines stated) is a slap in the face to all those who respected the laws of their future country.",1322265600,,2520,4.551876379690949

Perhaps it was the lack of an antagonist in this episode is what made it seems so refreshing?
Clark's destiny as a hero was being challenged and his own inner turmoil was being documented since the beginning of this season.
We are treated to a beautiful conclusive episode that gives us friendly reminders of how far he's come through reminiscing during his high school reunion.

I can't say enough about how important this episode is to understanding what it is to be a hero.",1321660800,,577,4.808080808080808

With that being said, a hearty well done is in order for all that was involved in this incredible series of the greatest comic book hero ever.  All was done tastefully and in the true Smallville tradition. I'm gonna miss it, but thank God for these DVDs.",1320883200,4,587,4.528301886792453

However, Smallville has never looked or sounded better, for example, the Finale episode looks way better than any HDTV rip it is clearer and the main reason to own this besides the great 1080p video is the DTS-HD audio which is a first for the series on Blu Ray. The DTS track sounds unbelievable, it's loud, completely fills the room and is the best way to enjoy the final season of this awesome show.

4147945,5,B003L77GG0,"This review is more for season 10 itself.  I think after nine seasons, after starting off in one place and really taking the series (and its characters) to places fans probably never thought it/they would go, expectations for the tenth season were undoubtedly sky high and in my opinion that's why a lot of people have given some negative reviews about some parts of the season.  The only episode I allowed myself to have any real expectation for was ""Finale.""  I've been through this before; The seventh season of 'Charmed' and a good portion of season eight was fantastic, but my expectations to tie up so many loose ends that final season let me down.  Same with Buffy and Angel ... So I promised myself I would not create any expectations in my mind of what the final season should be.  I approached it like it was not the final season.

Doing that allowed me to enjoy each episode (some were not as good, admittedly, but every season of every show has its weaker episodes).  I'll give the writers and producers (and especially the cast) credit; they really do CRAM A LOT in these twenty-one episodes (""Finale"" is two hours).  Annette O'Toole and John Schneider (Martha and Jonathan Kent) make touching returns; John Glover's return is absolutely chilling as he reinvents Lionel as a nemesis, not the soft(er)-hearted sometimes-villain he had become prior to falling to his death at the end of the seventh season.  James Marsters rocked as Brainiac 5, and Laura Vandervoort's episode, though one of the weaker of the season, showed a Kara that had grown since we'd seen her last.  Callum Blue's return as Zod (who know ruled the Phantom Zone) was one of my favorites.  Appearances in ""Finale"" by Michael Rosenbaum (always fabulous as Lex Luthor) and Aaron Ashmore as the real Jimmy Olson.  Most of all I was happy Allison Mack came back for six episodes, book-ending the season with Chloe sacrificing herself to save Oliver and playing a solid role in the finale, as it should have been.  I'll admit I was a bit ticked that Mack did not sign on as a regular for the full season, especially considering she was lasted longer than any other cast member on the show (except Tom Welling, of course), but ultimately I think it was fitting.  After years of taking a back seat to Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang, Mack really proved her worth during seasons eight and nine as the show's female lead.  Chloe Sullivan had more real character development in those two seasons than seasons five, six, and seven combined.  It was fitting, though, that she step aside and hand the role of female lead to Erica Durance (the best Lois Lane ever, in my opinion) for the final season.  Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen) and Cassidy Freeman (Tess Mercer) were brilliant in their roles; Freeman really rocked this season and held her own in a scenes with with Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover.

Though seasons eight and nine are my favorite, season ten is awesome and I highly recommend it.",1319760000,9,2965,4.713178294573644
4147946,5,B003L77GG0,"I discovered Smallville in its 3rd season. I could not wait to go back and see the first 2 seasons. It has been my favorite show of all time. The writers have done a good job with keeping the story going and not bringing things out too quickly. I have all 9 seasons and can not wait to get that final season. The one and only flaw of the whole series is when they killed off Jimmy olsen at the end of season 8. Other than that, the whole series is great. I really loved the way they wrapped everything up in the final episode and finally all the superman elements were there.(Except JImmy Olsen)I will really miss not having a new episode to watch every week, but I guess all good things must come to an end.

The casting was spot on for every character introduced in the series.  This series was an incredible ride from start to finish; it was plain outright fun and entertaining and it never disappointed.  The finale was great.  The writers had a lot to wrap-up in the finale.  Not only did that have to wrap-up lose ends from the series, but they had to accomplish the set-up to Superman and what will come afterward.  They did that and more.  Fans of this show will forever love the characters.  There is no better Lex Luther, Lois Lane, or Clark Kent than Michael Rosenbaum, Erica Durance, and Tom Welling.  Justin Hartley was the perfect Green Arrow and the character of Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) has earned her place in the Superman mythos.  Congratulations to the enite cast and crew of Smallville.  They brought us quality television for ten years.  Television is seriously lacking these days.  I have purchased the entire series on DVD and plan to watch it again from start to finish.

4148001,5,B003L77GG0,"The 10th, and final, season of SMALLVILLE was a refreshing mix of the old Smallville and the new. Tom Welling did some of his best acting in Season 10 as Clark Kent/The Blur and soon-to-be Superman! Clark finally morphed into a confident, mature hero that longtime viewers could see becoming Supes! And FINALLY Erica Durance was in EVERY SINGLE episode in Season 10 as Lois Lane! Welling and Durance as Clark and Lois were able to take their chemistry to another level and become the iconic couple. It may be ""Smallville"", but this version of Lois and Clark is going to be a tough act to follow!

In addition to Welling and Durance, Season 10 regulars included Cassidy Freeman (as Tess Mercer since Season 8) and Justin Hartley (as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow since Season 6). And Allison Mack reprised her role as Chloe Sullivan in a limited fashion (appearing several eps throughout the season, including the finale).

Season 10 also brought back virtually all of the important characters during the show's formative years (Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex and Lionel Luthor, Zod, Kara, Brainiac). These old characters served as a reminder of where Smallville came from and how it got to the point where it was, while still managing to move the story along.

The Season 10 story arcs are the arrival of Darkseid through the portal that was opened in the Season 9 finale when Zod and the Kandorians went to their new home world, the clone Lex storyline, and the VRA subplot. While I thought the Darkseid stuff was a mixed bag and the VRA pretty useless, the clone Lex story was the saving grace of the subplots, as well as Clois. Also, it was in the Season 9 finale that Lois realized Clark's dual identity so in Season 10, she knows all about him, but doesn't let him onto it until the right time.

Season 10 got off to a great start with the fascinating episode Ep 1-LAZARUS, a wonderful teaser as to Clark's future potential as Superman with an aging clone of Lex Luthor (excellently played by MacKenzie Gray) escaping a Luthorcorp facility and wreaking havoc on Metropolis and Lois Lane; Clark has to save the day in typical Superman fashion! Also, a lone surviving clone of Lex, the little boy Alexander, is saved by Tess from the facility before it is destroyed and this clone ages to several stages of Lex's life in future Season 10 eps. The ep ends with a heartfelt conversation between Clark and Jonathan's ghost (reprised by the esteemed John Scheider) and the entrance of Darkseid!

Arguably the best ep of Season 10 is Ep 4-HOMECOMING (also the 200th ep of the series), which has a sort of ""Christmas Carol"" vibe with an improved, futuristic good-guy version of Brainiac (brilliantly reprised by James Marsters, who played the role in Seasons 5 and 7) taking Clark on a journey through his past, present, and future which leads Clark to realize his potential as Earth's savior. It also includes one of the best moments of Season 10 (heck, the series!) with a beautiful Clois scene at the end of a declaration of love and Clark floating!

Other early standouts of Season 10 include the underrated Ep 5-ISIS, a very funny, quick-witted ep which allows the 4 main cast members to all shine (really enjoyed Justin Hartley's work in this ep!) and includes semi-regular character Cat Grant (played hilariously by Keri Lynn Pratt introduced in Ep 2-SHIELD) and has yet another smashing Clois moment at the end with Tom Welling delivering an amazing speech to Lois! Also Ep 7-AMBUSH brings back the always reliable Michael Ironside (reprising the role of Lois' dad General Sam Lane) and Peyton List (again playing Lois' sister Lucy); both characters were introduced in Season 4, Lois' first season on the show. Ep 8-ABANDONED is a haunting ep where Clark, Lois, and Tess are forced to confront their familial demons from the past. Ep 10-LUTHOR is one of the top Season 10 eps with Clark accidentally going to an alternate universe where we again get to see Lionel Luthor (reprised by the great John Glover, who was a regular for the first 7 seasons), who in the alternate world raised Clark's evil doppel ganger Clark Luthor. Ep 11-ICARUS is the one where Clark proposes to Lois.

The second half of Season 10 includes the standout eps 13-BEACON (where the radiant Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent) and a teenaged clone of Lex (well played by teen idol Lucas Grabeel, who actually played the real teen Lex back in a Season 6 flashback episode) seeks revenge on Clark. Ep 14-MASQUERADE is a funny, witty ep, the one where Clark realizes he must start wearing glasses to hide his true identity.

The last part of Season 10 goes out on a high note with a string of awesome eps! In Ep 16-SCION, the clone Lex story comes to an end as the teen clone (Grabeel again in a fine turn) turns out to share Lex and Clark's DNA and ends up as Connor Kent (future Superboy!). Ep 17-KENT is another best ep of the season contender as Clark Luthor returns sending Clark back to the alternate world where he meets none other than the alternate Jonathan Kent (reprised again by Schneider), a bitter man because the alternate Oliver Queen had mined farmers' land for Kryptonite in order to find a way to stop Clark Luthor. Ep 18-BOOSTER is a suprisingly entertaining ep with future superhero Booster Gold (hilariously played by Eric Martsoff) dropping in on Metropolis to steal Clark's thunder, as Clark must immerse himself more and more into the nerd-with-glasses persona to throw people off. Ep 19-DOMINION marks the return of Zod (reprised by the mercurial Callum Blue, who played the role all of Season 9) as Clark and Oliver travel to the Phantom Zone where the Kandorians have imprisoned Zod. Ep 20-PROPHECY is the pre-finale ep where Lois gets Clark's powers for a day and makes a shocking pronouncement at the end; Durance's emotional acting at the end of this ep and also at the end of Dominion is Emmy-worthy!

Eps 21 and 22 are the FINALE parts 1 and 2 (shown as a 2-hour episode originally) that includes Clark and Lois' wedding, Darkseid's attack on Earth, and the return of none other than Lex Luthor (reprised by the terrific Michael Rosenbaum, who brilliantly essayed the role for the first 7 seasons)!

In the end, I'd say SMALLVILLE gave the fans what it really wanted...Clark Kent becoming Superman!

4148002,4,B003L77GG0,"The tenth and final season of ""Smallville"" features some outstanding shows such as the premiere episode, ""Lazarus"" and the series' 200th episode, ""Homecoming."" Of course the march to the finale kept fans tuning in week after week. I have watched the show for years and enjoyed it although I realized it was uneven at times and didn't always pay off. To me, the final show, ""Finale"" is a perfect example of this. A lot of season ten was spent on Clark and Lois Lane's relationship and plans for the wedding. The first hour of the finale focused on the wedding and then, guess what? No wedding! It may happen seven years from now! What??!! Then, we were teased with the Superman suit in the first episode and other shows including the next-to-last show. Did they pay that off? No, of course not! Welling never dons the suit. We get a CGI Superman flying and a rip of his shirt revealing the Superman logo for the final shot. Even an extreme close-up of Welling with a CGI cape billowing behind him. Again, what the heck??!! I really had faith that writers Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders would come through. Now I am left with a disappointment with the series due to the finale and Tom not flying with the suit on. The pay-offs were lacking. We did get a great scene of Jonathan handing the suit to Clark (for what good that did!) and a great shot of Clark flying out of the fortress and I liked the shot too when Lois saw him flying outside the plane. But I had hoped to smile when I think of the finale and I don't. I did like the scene when Jonathan and Martha and Clark all embrace in the barn as Apocalypse is heading toward earth. One can only hope that maybe a reunion movie will be made some day and Tom Welling, realizing how disappointed many fans were, will actually no longer fear to put the suit on. I will buy this season but with a mixed bag of emotions.",1313971200,2,1868,4.355300859598854
4148003,4,B003L77GG0,"Okay, this is it, my final review of Smallville for Season 10.  The ending of the show had its high points and low points, lets run down the episodes!

1. Lazurs.....In great Smallville fashion. A great opening........to the season, some incredible moments with Lex showing up (NOT Michael Rosenbaum) at least not yet

2.  Shield...........Hated the new character of Cat Grant......made this episode unwatchable.  But a little interesting storyline with Lois and Carter in Egypt

3. SUpergirl.........Kara returns,  good episode for the season

4. Homecoming.......Probably the best episode of the whole season,  A look into Clarks future,  Brainiac returns!

5. Isis........DID NOT LIKE IT!

6.  Harvest.........DID NOT LIKE IT!........but be sure to watch the Tess/Alexandar storyline........very powerful

7.  Ambush.......The Lanes are back together.......2 words....MICHAEL Ironside.....and keep ur eye open for Teri Hatcher

8.  Abanonded.....great episode.....we learn that much more about Tess.....does she have a relationship with somebody?

9.  Patriot.......oh god, Aquman returns...LAME

10. Luthor.......YES LIONEL Luthor returns,  AWESOME

11.  Icarus........decent episode,  a character dies.

12.  Collaterl.....What is Chloe up to.  Great episode

13. Beacon.......Good episode,  Martha Kent is back

14. Masquerade.......I thought it was a rather boring episode.

15. Fortune.....Funny episode.....The whole crew wakes up from a ""hangover""

16. Scion.......good episode.....So is Alexandar good or bad?

17. Kent........great episode.....What? Jonathan Kent is back??

18.  Booster.....not one of my favs

19. Dominon....Clark and Oliver are back in the PHantom Zone.  GREAT EPISODE!

20.  Propechy.....The build up to the FINAL episode.....What is happening to Oliver??

21.  THE FINAL EPISODE.........Could have been better, it was good but not great.  Dont really get a clear shot of Clark flying or in the suit....Michael Rosenbaum returns,  but it didn't do anything for me

All in all, it was a great SHOW!  But the final episode, could have been so much stronger!",1313884800,,2088,5.905405405405405
4148004,5,B003L77GG0,"Why does this get released on November 29th? They usually release Smallville in September, if someone can tell me why I would greatly appreciate it. However Samllville was one of the best shows on television along with Supernatural, Psych, and Mad Men in my opinion. As a Superman collector for years and years I was very happy that this show was able to wrap things up without being cut short. Smallville quite frankly means a lot to me and I refuse to believe that one season was better than another, it's a very large character arc and some lulls are to be expected when a character is developed from beginning to end (or at least the end of that particular chapter of development). Even after Michael Rosenbaum left the show after season seven they didn't panic, they still worked hard and gave it's audience something worth their time.

The only thing I wish they had done and I know that it was impossible but I would have loved to have seen it at least once would have been Clark meeting a young Bruce Wayne. I just think that would have been really really awesome, but it wasn't possible and I'm not sure it would have worked in the plot line. Tom Welling will forever be my envisionment of Superman/Clark Kent and he even without being a hardcore fan of the Superman mythos just continually knocked it out of the park episode after episode. I would just like to say thanks to him for being awesome.

The real reason you would want to buy this is simply to finish your consumption of an epic story, a transformation from man to legend, from hero to superhero. I wasn't sure how they were going to tie up everything after ten years worth of plot to integrate into two hours but they succeeded in grandiose fashion and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A very heartfelt thank you to everyone associated with the show, on my end it has been a very fun ride and this show will be sorely missed.",1313625600,,1901,4.491329479768786

This season culminated in the most satisfying series finale that I have ever seen on a television show to date.  As a fan of Superman since I was a little girl, this series from the start was refreshing in the fact that it was the journey of Clark Kent to become the Superman everyone knows and loves.  The finale definitely delivered, from the tights, to the flight, and finally at the end, the music that has raised goosebumps on every fan's arm since we first heard it.

4148007,3,B003L77GG0,"Let me start off by saying that I have been a DIEHARD Smallville fan since its inception in 2001. Although I have thoroughly enjoyed each season, season 10 is definitely the weakest of the series.  One of the problems of this season is that they take DC's greatest villain Darkseid and reduce him to a ""smokey"" afterthought. Smallville has always done a great job of integrating villains from the comics and putting their own little twist on it to fit a CW budget but Darkseid fails to make the cut considerably. Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, and even Doomsday have all been transfered from the comic book pages onto the TV screen with great results but Darkseid literary makes an appearance for like 10 seconds in a total of 22 episodes. There is so much untapped potential with the Darkseid character which ultimately makes this season disappointing. Another disappointing element to this season is the sub plot of Oliver Queen revealing his identity to the world. This contributes nothing to the overall plot arch and what makes it worse is that it was directly ripped off from the movie Iron Man. The introduction of Cat Grant leading the opposition against the superheroes is pointless as well. Her character is annoying, irritating, and contributes little to the season. They should have used the hot Cat Grant from season 8 and perhaps introduce an interesting little love triangle when Lois Lane leaves for Egypt. Like I said, most of this season has so much untapped potential. Another disappointing element of the season is the return of Chloe. Chloe is one of Smallville's most popular characters and her return is shoddy at best. The episode ""Collateral"" which introduces her return and is a rip-off of the Matrix is perhaps one of the worst episodes of the series. Other elements of the season such as the Vigilante Registration Act, The Suicide Squad, and the government's involvement of superheroes is shoddy, contrived, cheesy and unsubstantial at best. The episode Fortune which blatantly imitates the Hangover movies all but exemplifies the problem of this season in that it borrows from all sorts of popular movies and in the process loses its identity as a great Superman show. Also, Clark Kent decides to shed the Black trenchcoat and wear a Michael Jackson inspired ""Thriller"" jacket to reflect his growing optimism and hope necessary to become the Man of Steel. Unfortunately the new costume is very very cheesy. He would have probably been better off he kept the Black Trenchcoat untill he becomes the Man of Steel.
  Despite the disappointing nature of season 10, The series finale blew me away. I have to say the Series Finale is the best series Finale of any television show EVER! They did a perfect job of wrapping up 10 seasons of great memories while leading the groundwork for his role as Superman. I was absolutely shocked at the quality of the final episode especially since the rest of the season was mediocre. Other highlights include the season premiere as well as the 200th episode ""Homecoming"" which are some of the top episodes in the series. Overall, If you watched all of the other seasons and enjoyed them I strongly recommend you pick up the Final season to see how it all ends. The package is a mixed bag but the resounding conclusion will more than make up for it!",1310083200,28,3306,4.827160493827161

The original laws of anyone who finds out he has powers dies ended long ago. Fot a few seasons It was nothing more than a night time soap opera. With everything for 1 special effect was even gone.
Still the effects of there slow motion technique, allowing us to see what happens In the blink of an eye Is well worked and Impressive.
So now the ending.
Without giving anything away, It was the most creative season In 3 years. Everything and the many many subplots were all explained or had an ending. I guess that's the good thing about knowing It was the last season the cast seemed to want to work even harder for that lasting Impression of their acting.
I'd give this 5 stars If I was rating my personal taste and if a 4.5 I would but I can't give It 5 stars. It's just not In that catagory In any way.
BUT please all you long time fans will love the season and 2 episode ending. After Zod, this was fresh and Lois of course who brought the show the best new blood of all when she arrived' Is the best of the season again. I believe her and Tess are the best actors on the show.

4148053,5,B003L77GG0,"No matter what, Smallville had integrity. There was a specific vision in place from the beginning. Not a grand mapped out vision exactly, but an idea of a show that charted the journey of Clark Kent from naive farmboy to Superman. Slowly over the course of 10 seasons they evolved the characters and true to their word gave us Superman in the end. Through production and cast changes Smallville always told fun stories that looked great (especially for a WB/CW TV show) and were exciting.",1306713600,3,488,4.752941176470588

4148055,1,B003L77GG0,"It's official, Smallville butchered Superman.
The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation.
The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names.
The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash.
Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring!
Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies. Live action films are just horrid, cartoons, that's where it's at.",1306022400,8,1944,4.605187319884727
4148056,3,B003L77GG0,"My favorite episodes of Smallville were when they introduced other superhero characters.  So I LOVED the beginning part of this season where they had a bunch of different superheroes.  But at the end?  Clark adopts ""superboy"" and when Clark disappears for 3 weeks, no mention of Superboy.  The same with the Wedding (that did not happen).  No superheros show up to see their best friend get married?  Come on?  What a let down.  As for budgeting, the budgeting constraints were very obvious in the 2nd half of this season.  Very low budget.  If you watched this show all of the way through, you are going to buy the tenth season no matter what.  For me, from what was being said at the beginning of the season, and the quality of the first half of the tenth season, I was disappointed in the second half of the tenth season.",1305936000,3,824,4.5
4148057,5,B003L77GG0,"I totally agree with Tony T and I never will forget Smallville. This is, and ever will be, my most favorite show. A decade is a long time for a TV series (especially one on CW). Therefore, I am honored to have witnessed the development of a clumsy, unsure, superpowered teenage boy who finds out he's from another planet. His exploratory journey featured some struggles between emotions and duty, selfishness, and trials. But most importantly, we got awesome beatdowns, supervillans, superheroes, the world's best sidekicks and companions. And OMG, all that is covered in that short amount of time. So, if you're not a Smallville fan, but a Superman fan, you still need to watch it. All great journeys must come to an end. This marvelous journey ends with our hero realizing that he is the only one that can save the world that he has come to love. Of course we(fans) all knew that 10 years ago, but we cheated. Clark needed a little extra time and I appreciate the delay. Thanks to all involved for a decade of SuperAwesomeness!",1305936000,2,1029,4.69060773480663
4148058,1,B003L77GG0,"I used to like watching this series early on, when it had stories in it, before the endless sad futility of the Lana Lang romance wore me out... Thought I'd give this last season a try, see if it all came to anything. And what I found was a travesty. Whole episodes seem to consist of characters pretentiously declaiming abstract profundities like, ""In order to live in the present, I need to let go of the past, dad. That means I have to say goodbye to you."" It seems as if the whole story is taking place on some level of vapid commentary. They forgot to invent action - actual plotlines - that would convey these trite messages and make them fresh. It's like a clinic in what Henry James said not to do when he advised authors to show, not tell. The finale goes even farther, with Clark realizing that he shouldn't have let go of the past after all, because although his strength comes from Krypton, his heroic traits come from the Kent family farm. Only this message isn't dramatized -- nothing happens that would make the viewer realize it as lived truth -- instead it is rammed down our throats in the form of...words. We don't need characters saying things like,""A hero can only be as strong as his enemies, so that's why I, Lex Luthor, am here."" That is supposed to be the job of commentators and critics, who unearth such insights from a good story. But these modern protagonists insist on bloviating about their own significance. The rest of the story is either really bad science fiction or really generic soap opera, and the performances are the same. Some talented actors are dragged down by the lines they must speak. The splendid Erica Durance is turned into a sappy one-dimensional poster girl for faithfulness and fairy tale marriage; the mischievous Alison Mack barely rises above her Spielberg-like bedtime story scene; and it's hard to tell if Tom Welling can act, but he comes off as irretrievably stiff and not too bright, and doesn't look facially anything like any Superman we've ever seen in comics. If you like watching people make speeches about the deep meaning of life instead of embodying it, you'll love Smallville Season 10. All moral, no story.",1305676800,12,2177,4.6571428571428575

It sucks that theres not going to be anymore Smallville on tv because I grew up with the show since the start. The finale of the Smallville series was pretty good in my opinion. The last ten minutes of the series was absoultely breathtaking and amazing. It was awesome to see Clark become the man he was destined to be and I really liked that they brought back Lex. I wish maybe they could have brought back Lana but she was really not that big a part of the Superman comics anyway. I know this is the end of the Smallville series but I just want to say that this is my favorite show of all time and I was always very excited to watch the next episode and see what they were going to do this iconic character and show.

4148187,5,B003L77GG0,"MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW

The tenth season of ""Smallville"" is a tremendous ride to a stirring final episode.  It is a great sendoff overall for what is arguably the finest television series of its entire genre.

Beginning with ""Lazarus,"" the season propels Clark on a fantastic journey. Pulled back from death in the season premiere by Lois Lane, the love of his life, Clark must face a freakishly cloned Lex Luthor, played extremely well in the premiere by Mackenzie Gray.  Additionally, Clark must contend with the knowledge that an evil supernatural being known as Darkseid threatens to dominate the Earth.  John Schneider also returns in the first episode as Johnathan Kent, Clark's departed Earthly father, now a spirit guide for him.

The season's second episode ""Shield,"" is an important show for the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller's corrupt fighting force.  The group of radically violent superhero supporters comes to the forefront as the primary villains in the early half of the season.  The show also introduces the ""Smallville"" iteration of Cat Grant, a latter-day ""Superman"" character whom I first became familiar with through ""Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman.""  Played by actress Keri Lynn Pratt, she is fairly annoying but essentially has good intentions.

This season also features the series' landmark 200th episode, an absolute gem called ""Homecoming.""  The return of James Marsters as Brainiac 5 heralds a stunning trip through time for Clark.  An important component of emotional peace and closure regarding Johnathan's death finally gives Clark a mature philosophical base for true love with Lois Lane.  Unfortunately, the very next episode ""Isis"" is one of the few true low points of the season, a head-scratching show whose storyline is random and pointless.  It mostly exists to drag a fringe superhero into the show but does have a moment of redemption at its conclusion.

When ""Smallville"" premiered in 2001, its premise and promise was the journey of the hero Clark Kent and the future villain Lex Luthor.  As with any long-running TV series, cast members gradually left ""Smallville,"" even including the show's original mature Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum.  To the immense credit of the series' creative staff, the overall story arc was wisely altered slightly, to both keep the name Lex Luthor viable in the series and make room for a charismatic female antihero named Tess Mercer.  Cassidy Freeman contributes depth and ultimately compassion as a multifaceted actress, and has a very rich character arc in the final season.  Lex Luthor is kept viable this season through a series of clones, ironically at first nurtured in secret by Tess.  I can forgive an absurd contrivance to bring the deceased Lionel Luthor back to life in the episode ""Luthor.""  The show is one of the best of the season, and John Glover's devilishly cold acting approach to Lionel Luthor is, technically speaking, the work of a master.

Episode highlights are ""Homecoming,"" ""Ambush,"" ""Abandoned,"" ""Icarus,"" ""Shield,"" ""Patriot,"" ""Lazarus,"" and the series finale, a two-hour masterpiece entitled simply ""Finale.""

The finale is a thoughtful romp through ten years of series backstory, thematically exploring the character of Clark Kent in its first half and revealing the character of Superman in its second half.  The Darkseid storyline comes to a gruesome head and original series stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum fulfill the series' intial promise.  A brilliant storytelling balance highlighting the marriage of Clark and Lois and the full emergence of Superman juxtaposed against a monstrous dark turn for both Lionel and Lex sets the perfect tone for the series' conclusion.

I love ""Smallville.""  Over its time on the air, it has become one of my favorite television shows of all time.  Thank you to the cast and crew through all ten years, and to original series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.  This is a truly brilliant show.",1305417600,92,3962,5.183962264150943

4148189,5,B003L77GG0,"This is my first time ever posting a review so I have to say that the series finale blew me away. They had a lot to wrap up in a brief period of time and did it all so well. Smallville has been around long enough to go through some definite changes over the years. I started watching the series at about season 3 and was pretty much hooked. After waiting for this character to be able to fly for almost a decade (but well knowing the show would end as soon as that happened - so bittersweet), I have to say that it met all my expectations. I have to commend Tom Welling for driving this series to an explosive conclusion. I really don't think there is another actor who could have pulled it off like this. I'm glad they wrapped up multiple story lines that tie so well into the actual comic and movie universe that has come before. It happens quickly and definitively and it was awesome. The show was full of action and emotion and movie quality effects and acting. Kudos to the FX team...just wow...watch it and I think you'll agree. They also took no liberties that take away anything from the actual mythology and this comes from a person who has read a lot of Superman comics. I won't spoil anything for anyone reading this but I'll say if you are a true comics and movie fan of the superman mythology, you'll see countless nods to the source material here which I thought was great. The little flashbacks they had that kind of recapped the entire series during the two hour long finale was nice too. I'm sure the same people who complained about not having enough Venom in the Spider-Man movies will complain about one particular aspect of the finale but I actually like how they did it. Prolonging it would have cheesed things up. Kudos to the cast...You will all be missed. Thanks for ten years of what will go down in my mind as one of the definitive Superman-based series. Incredible...would love to see a movie in the future folks. Thanks again.",1305331200,5,1955,4.418282548476454
4148190,5,B003L77GG0,"I literally waited for this moment for 10 years. And when they announced this was the last season, the anticipation grew.
In earlier seasons, sometimes I thought they took some of the heroic aspect away from Clark. But in season 10 they capitalized on Clark's true heroism and integrity. To me, this is what Superman is all about. I think season 10 was the best.
And the Finale capped it all off. While I had some questions about how they did a couple things, all in all, they launched Superman into his career with all the pomp and fanfare the hero deserves.
As somewhat of a side issue, I think this episode provides one answer to the age-old question of ""Who is the best - Superman or ....?"" It won't end the argument, but I think this makes quite the statement. And Superman was always my favorite.",1305331200,2,802,4.462585034013605

And whenever anyone would talk about it I would scoff and say ""I haven't watched that in years"".  Somewhere during the middle of season eight I started watching it again and became a fan again.

They only showed Green Arrow for like 15 seconds then the talking part was like 30 minutes I seen better Superman stuff then what they did, Superman Returns and Justice League did way better job's then that, Im sorry I watch Smallville for a long time but the episode was not that good, for any show to have a last episode it dosen't matter if its Icarly,Ben 10 or 24 you make sure the last episode is the best.",1305244800,3,847,4.133333333333334

Clark and Lois are the only characters from the main cast that make an appearance and the only reoccurring role is Kat Grant (who I detest, although she becomes a little more palatable by the end of the episode). It had a good story, but it just seemed to be missing something else along with the absent characters. That being said, in this episode we see Clark trying to be the bumbling reporter we know from other Superman shows/movies and it really does a lot to solidify Clark's move in that direction.

I did watch a couple of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies as a child and so I know the basics of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, but other than that...I know nothing.  And I'm glad because I think this is what makes it easier for me to enjoy ALL of Smallville.  I had no expectations and thus I was not disappointed in the overall story of Smallville. The story that I was always interested in was, of course, Clark Kent.  Let's face it...this story is about him and how he deals with life and with his destiny.  That's it...and to see him struggle with it all was refreshing to see, at least to me.  He wasn't this perfect being that knew where his place in ""history"" was...he had to figure it out which is where all the drama of Smallville began...Clark ""dealing"" with life...which included over protective parents, a first love (Lana Lang) who could never quite trust him, a friend (Lex Luthor) that became a life long enemy, a sidekick (Chloe) that was the best friend he could have ever had but who also lost a little bit of faith in him, a fellow superhero (Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow) that tested his morality and always fell short, and last but not least...my favorite...Lois Lane...the unlikeliest person for him to fall in love with but who believed in him...or in Smallville storyland...the Blur...more than anyone else did...even Chloe.  That's why in this Smallville version, Clark tells Lois...you were always the one that I needed.  Her complete trust in what he represented is what he needed in this story to meet his destiny.  This may not be IAW the Superman mythos, but it's darn good storytelling and I have loved every minute of it.  I will be sad to see the series end because I could watch Lois and Clark played by Erica Durance and Tom Welling, banter back and forth and save the world for many, many more years to come.  There are few series in TV land today that match the storytelling of this series.  Thank you Smallville for some many great stories that I will continue to watch over and over again.",1302048000,167,2142,4.546875

I get so into it and then bang a commercial boo. I think if you want all the shows you have do some shopping because sometimes you can find the show for cheaper if you know which store to shop at and if it  goes on sale get it, great show and it will be missed, I hope the stars do well when she go off the air

We'll be looking for great things from Alison, Tom, Justin, and the rest of the crew.  Just one or two good saves before you call it quits huh?

Episode List:
1) LAZARUS: GRADE A- ...Lois saves Clark from brink of death - reminiscent of the ""Death of Superman"" comic book cover. COMMENTARY
2) SHIELD: A- ...Clark begins to reembrace his primary colors thanks to Lois' rival, Cat Grant who arrives at the Daily Planet while she's in Egypt befriending Hawkman -minus the beard, handsome Michael Shanks. DELETED SCENES
3) SUPERGIRL: B ...Clark and Kara have a family reunion. Green Arrow reveals his identity not caring that his former love almost got killed protecting him. DELETED SCENES
4) HOMECOMING: A++ ...The scenes taking place in the future and the barn scene make this episode one of the very best. However, Oliver's speech was moronic and hypocritical given that he's the one who made the conscious decision to ""step out of the shadows."" FEATURETTE
5) ISIS: A ...The last fifteen minutes are DIAMOND-STUDDED GLORIOUS!!
6) HARVEST: A ...From start to finish, this episode might have been taken right out of ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" - only much, much sexier and with an edge.
7) AMBUSH: A+ ...General Sam Lane played by the superb Michael Ironside arrives for Thanksgiving dinner. His idea for the Vigilante Registration Agency is actually what the Justice League will become in the future when Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman take over its leadership. The difference here is that Darkseid has agitated anti-hero sentiment allowing those who would enforce it to use it as a weapon.
8) ABANDONED: A- ...Tess Mercer aka Lutessa Lena Luthor learns about her past. Lois and Clark's parents deliver touching messages through video recordings. DELETED SCENES
9) PATRIOT: A- ...Directed by Tom Welling, Aquaman and wife Mera show Clark and Lois the advantage of allowing your best girl to be your best ally. General Slade becomes Deathstroke after a run-in with the Justice League.
10) LUTHOR: B+ ...Welling in one of his most electrifying performances both as Kent and Luthor.
11) ICARUS: A+ ...Hawkman and Deathstroke's fight scene is the finest choreographed of the series. In the last scene, everyone involved is at their most beautiful - especially Erica Durance who looks like Wonder Woman and Welling who looks like THE Superman.
12) COLLATERAL: D+ ...Written by Jordan Hawley -it's hard to believe this is the same person who wrote the masterpiece that is The Rain Scene in last season's ""Rabid."" He ridiculously glorified chloe at everyone's expense and made Lois sound stupid considering that when she bashed the ""Tea Party"" she was bashing her own father. The only things worth watching here were Black Canary, the virtual flight scene and Clark and Lois' first and last scenes together. Everything else was trash.
13) BEACON: D- ...Perry ""Bulldog"" White a she-man hippie? Ha! Yeah, right. With his classic choleric personality, he'd crash a war as an embedded journalist getting the stories first hand and not accepting anyone's spin on a story except his own. Hippies were not rebels. They were lazy, horny, dope-addicted cowards who started the ""make love not war"" hypocrisy just to avoid the draft. Notice they didn't have a problem sending others to war when they got into power (Bill Clinton, anyone?). They glorify JFK yet they conveniently forget that he's the one who got us involved in the Vietnam War in the first place. Ghandi, MLK Jr., the American revolutionists of the 18th century- they were genuine and admirable rebels. This makes two lousy episodes in a row that Lois is written out of character. She is not an unperceptive insecure feminazi. Lois Lane has been a strong, intelligent, confident, independent yet at her core (like Superman) passionate, loving, iconic gentlewoman for over seven decades so her scene with Martha Kent made no sense at all especially since they've known each other for years and Lois is the reason Martha's even in politics. Their interaction in ""Hostage"" was so much more natural. Welling's distraction for his other project really showed in this episode. At least the fan videos were nice. I liked the one sent in by the soldier. Other than that, this wasn't worth the time. DELETED SCENES
14) MASQUERADE: B- ...Ah, what a breath of fresh air it was to see MY Lois again after two miserable episodes. And Mr. Kent? Sexy, sexy, SEXY! It was so GOOD to see/hear their classic, hilarious, pure gold banter again! Downside: Episodes 12-15 shaped up to be chloe's Arc of Suck. At least this time, the iconic duo weren't completely sidelined.
15) FORTUNE: C ...Bursts of hilarity(courtesy of Emil-Elvis/Tess duet,drunken Clark,Oliver in drag)mixed with the Smallville writers' pathetic and very desperate attempt to cannonize themselves through their creation:chloe sullivan. They had her outright declare herself the ""king maker"" in being THE ONE who inspires Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to greatness? I'd get mad at this if it wasn't so sad and ridiculous. Writers who can't exercise objectivity when the outcome of the story is on the line have no business being producers. Lois/Clark's eventual wedding was a payoff for stomaching all the shams: Lex/lana, chloe and the two cannon characters she had no business messing with. Because of her one ended up dead, the other with a dark mark and away from his destined true love. Seriously, if I were a family member of the creators of ""the big 3"" I'd sue them for disrespecting 7 decades of hard work by thousands of artists and craftsmen and the millions of fans who supported them. MUSIC VIDEO
16) SCION: D ...Besides giving Lionel a well deserved all around smack-down, there wasn't a point here that piqued interest. His re-introduction in ""Luthor"" was tantalizing but it turned out to be a DUD - as did the ""Lex clone."" A couple of scenes were just WRONG on so many levels. Definitely one of the worst stories of the series. It's like they tried to sneak in a pilot for a spin-off but it just fell apart into an unentertaining and somewhat disturbing mess. DELETED SCENES
17) KENT: B- ...Where ""Luthor"" was better done focusing on the family as a whole, ""Kent"" was lopsided in that the focus was the Kent Farm, not the family itself. It also focused too much on the Luthors again.
18) BOOSTER: A++ ...EXCELLENCE PERSONIFIED - BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON AND THE SERIES. If this show were to have any kind of spin-off, I'd want it to be just like this. Written by DC Comics executive Geoff Johns and directed by executive producer/star Tom Welling, this is the only episode where only two regular cast members (Welling and Durance) appear. Handsome Eric Martsolf was born to play Booster Gold. Welling ends his Smallville directing career with IMPRESSIVE ECSTATIC SUPERMANLY FLAIR!
19) DOMINION: C- ...Cheesy and predictable. The ""gladiator"" fight scenes were very funny, though - they looked like skinny spoofs of Conan the barbarian in slow motion. But at least it did (clumsily) move the story along and it was nice to see Callum Blue again albeit, clearly, not his best performance. COMMENTARY
20) PROPHECY: B- ...The ""crazy quilt"" of the season. Very nice moments sewn into a tapestry of visually rich scenes framed in stunning fashion. But, there was much, too, too much jammed into one single episode without proper exploration leaving one dissatisfied. Case in point:Kara's (Laura Vandervoort's) departure. It was an ill-conceived stunt even when DC allowed it in Justice League Unlimited. Perhaps, it was no accident that Season 9 (despite its plotholes)remained the greatest, most tightly executed season in the series' entire ten-year run AND it was also the one and ONLY season when Welling was fully engaged as star/producer the entire year (come season 10, his producing time was cut in half due to his ""Glee knock-off"" dramedy). Absent Welling's undivided attention to detail, 10 fell prey to the typical pitfalls of seasons 1-8: strong first half (and 10 did have the strongest ever) followed by a second half full of anti-climactic non-resolutions, strong story lines shamefully rushed, glossed over while weak and Superman-irreleveant arcs were wasted over several episodes.
21) (WEDDING)FINALE PART 1: A++ ...The last episode filmed (as Part 2 was filmed third to last). It explains why most of the cast members seemed so genuinely emotional - in the barn, the door scene and then the wedding. They were tenderly staged and photographed - simple, elegant... beautiful.
22) (SUPERMAN)FINALE PART 2: A++ ...For once, Ausiello was wrong and they stuck with ""finale"" as the official title. Just as well. For me, it confirms that the writers were never interested in telling Superman stories, only in using his fame to promote their show. Welling punked out. He did not wear the suit. The Fortress sequence was thrilling but after that, it was just close-ups of his face and an all CGI caricature. Still, the final 2 and 1/2 minutes were... PERFECT. Or, as perfect as this show ever got.

I'll remember it as ""the Superman show that wasn't about Superman."" Thanks to certain elements though, Smallville's decathlon held glimpses of genuine cinematic greatness (if only Welling had the guts to follow completely through). All in all, it was an often interesting (when Clark and his Lois were the focus), at times too far-fetched (superlana and Black Canary-wannabe shortkick chloe) and needlessly melodramatic (lana seasons 3-8, chloe seasons 6-10, oliver season 10 and the stupid clark,lex,lana triangle seasons 5-8) but because of its source origin (and in spite of its  writers/producers), always hopeful decade - not because we want/need to believe in heroes but because there ARE heroes regardless of wether we believe in them or not. And, when these heroes' deeds eventually touch our lives, they inspire us to create new ones and become them ourselves. Writers come and go but Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster's original Superman vision shines as bright as always. 73 years and counting... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way. Thank God for that.

4148421,4,B003L77GG0,"Rather like the make-it-up-as-you-go-along shows ""The X-Files,"" and ""Lost,"" it's obvious that the ""Smallville"" creators never expected this series to last more than a couple of seasons at best.  By season 10 Smallville and the Kent farm are not much more than a place to feed the dog and stare out toward the heavens from the hay loft of the barn.  From the beginning the series made the bold (and not necessarily wise) decision to discount the existing Superman myth and create a soap opera that would focus on entertaining young teens.  Once it was clear that this excursion would have little (or nothing) to do with the comic book character, I just went along for the ride, finding some episodes worthwhile and others close to embarrassing.  We find strange, distorted personifications of the Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Supergirl, select members of the JLA, etc., with the stitching for all frayed and generally disappointing.  Like so many other successful programs, ""Smallville"" did its best to fill the unexpected void opened up to the producers, cast, crew and scriptwriters.  Sometimes I really wanted to shame the writers for their staggering lack of imagination and reliance on older, staid sci fi material.  Since the series cowered away from turning Kal El into the ultimate superhero for years, we were always left with a kind of quasi-Superman, emotionally unbalanced, unfocused, and ignorant of his role as a self-sacrificing hero.  On balance, I credit the cast that so often made the totally ridiculous into something palatable.",1297987200,9,1559,5.134387351778656
4148422,5,B003L77GG0,"I just finished this episode and I think was great and I cannot wait for the rest the episodes that will take me to the end of this great series.

4148423,5,B003L77GG0,"Smallville has always been one of my faverote shows of all time. I discovered it back in 2004 when it first aired on ABC family, and has loved it ever since. With each season, we see clark getting a year closer to becoming superman, and now in season 10, we see that happen. In season 10, clark must put away his fears and deal with the darkness within before he reaches that point of becoming who he is to be.
  The one thing that truely stands out in season 10 from anything else is the cemistry between Clark and Lois. In the first five seasons, Clark was intrested in Lana. That was good for the time being, but I feel that Lana should have left the show after season 5, so that the Clark/Lois connection could have started eariler then it did in season 8. I hate thhat the show is ending because I feel that it will end with several cliffhangers because of the events that have already unfolded.  I don't want to give to much away but I will say that season 10 is the best season ever.

Edit: To the ones who are wondering why he hasn't flown yet or why he isn't wearing the suit. You must remember that the story follows clark kent BEFORE he's superman. His flying and wearing the suit happens after he becomes superman.",1297468800,3,1226,4.271551724137931
4148424,5,B003L77GG0,"I know the series is about Superman, and in the original Chloe Sullivan was a non-starter, but had the writers known a talent like Alison Mack, I've no doubt he would have written her in as this imaginative crew has done.  When she is there, the stories have a polish. shine and hopefulness that is missing when she's gone.  It will be fun to see how all three of these actors continue with their careers.  Justin Hartly is just superb and possibly the next Clint Eastwood - he'll shine.  Tom Wellington has grown as an actor and behind the scenes as a leader.  I hope he continues to do hero roles as it would be hard to see him betray what he's built so far.  Very much a Giant character like Rock Hudson!

I want to see the excellent flying sequences of the last movie version. I want that 'Up, Up and Away' (ex Radio and 1940's serial versions). I know I'm being quite super ficial but Superman is the guy who flies...that's his job. Batman runs, Green Hornet runs, The Flash runs but sup baby flies, its in the rules. Here in Oz season 10 is still en route (obviously not airmail) so I want to buy this item but I also want the 'Look up in the sky. Its a bird, its a plane..no its...well you know the rest.

4148428,5,B003L77GG0,"***SPOILER ALERT!***I fully intend to tell just about everything. Read at your own risk.

Our hero's journey to the end begins with death, believe it or not. After being stabbed in the gut by the self-promoted, General Zod, Clark is left for dead in the middle of the streets of Metropolis. Of course, Lois finds him. As she weeps over her lost love, Clark is trapped in some kinda Kryptonian purgatory. While in this near-death threshold, he is told by Jor-el that he, basically, gave up on his life and the lives of the humans he has sworn to protect. Granted, given the situation he was confronted with, he really didn't have any other choice. Of course, he coulda just sent them all to the Phantom Zone, but not all the Kryptonians were as purely evil as ""General"" Major Zod. Therefore, I can see why he didn't go that route. Anyway, after viewing his tombstone and seeing Lex lurking in the distance, our hero is awakened by his lady love, who pulls the blue kryptonite dagger from his body. She decides to honor his wish of superpower secrecy and hides before he awakens. Our hero arises and is immediately healed by the sun and superspeeds away, to Lois' delight.

Clark goes to Watchtower, where Chloe tells him absolutely NOTHING about Oliver's kidnapping. Clark informs her about seeing Lex. He goes to the Daily Planet to find a file on Lex's secret labs in the archives and guess who's there? Yep, Lois, who is searching for further insight into The Blur's(Man,I'll be glad when they get rid of that name)early saves. She pretends to drop a pen and look for it under the desk. She was very obvious, in her attempt to be inconspicuos..to us, anyway. Clark's never been big on noticing the obvious. He superspeeds to get the file while she's under the desk and he miraculously finds the file in a nearby pile, just as she ""finds"" her pen. She tells him that they need to talk and asks him to meet her in the barn.

Clark calls Chloe to see if she can get him some info on Cadmus, however she is unable to assist him because she's at the JSA brownstone trying Dr. Fate's helmet on for a peek at the future: ""Foolish girl, not chosen. Naboo knows"". She puts the helmet on, passes out and Clark takes her to Dr. Hamilton.

Meanwhile,back at Cadmus, Tess, who had half her face burned off in ""Salvation"", awakens with some weird goo on her face. She pulls it off and realizes her face has been restored to normal. She checks the place out and comes across an assortment of Lex Luthors. Most are grotesque and disfigured, with the exception of LX15: a little red-headed boy named Alexander. She hears banging on a door and goes to open it like an idiot. An older, more ""evolved"" Lex attacks her and sets the lab on fire.

Chloe awakens from her unconcious state and tells Clark that Cadmus is burning. Clark superspeeds away and Chloe bids him farewell in a whisper.

Meanwhile, Lois is waiting for him in the barn and comes across his primary colored outfit in all it's glory. The old Lex clone shows up and knocks Lois out.

Clark arrives at Cadmus and finds Tess tied up. He's kinda skeptical about setting her free, but he does and Tess tells hime that the Lex clone is waiting for him in Lawson's Field.

The Lex clone ties Lois to a stake and paints an ""S"" on her chest, just like the one that was painted on Clark when Whitney decided to ""scarecrow"" him in high school. Lex tells Lois that her death will break Clark, who arrives at Lawson's Field to face-off. Lex tells Clark many truths and lies. Lex tells Clark that he can, either, save the Daily Planet's globe from crashing down on innocent bystanders or save Lois. Furthermore, he insists that Clark can't save both at once. Well, he does.

After, performing his supersave, he goes to the barn to retrieve his ""technicolor"" suit, but is denied by Jor-el, who brings, both, Clark and the suit to the fortress. Jor-el tells Clark that he is the evil that needs to be fought. He tells him that he cannot be a beacon of hope with darkness in his heart. Of course, Clark has no idea what that means. Oh, but for a second, he thought he was flying(whatever!).

Oliver spends the majority of the his time being tortured by Rick Flag, the leader of the Suicide Squad. Chloe turns herself over to the Suicide Squad in exchange for Ollie's freedom. Lois goes to Africa to free Clark of the distraction of being in a relationship. Clark comes home to find a very short note from Lois stating that she couldn't pass up Africa. Clark, then, sees Jonathan working on a fence. I'm sorry, I still don't get this part. I guess the point was some kinda hero encouragement. He warns him about the darkness and disappears. Then, we get to see the ""Darkseid"" entity coming outta that birdbath that sent the Kandorians to their new home. Finally, we get to see that beautiful suit one more time as it's being held captive by Jor-el. He's not allowed to have it until he's earned it. Why do you need a cape, if you can't fly?",1292889600,3,4971,4.47682119205298

I have no idea where they are going with this arc but setting up the VRA as the gestapo of today is interesting.  It actually made me feel uncomfortable about our civil rights...LOL.  I generally don't think about politics when I watch television...and won't delve too much into it...I just want to enjoy what I see without over-thinking things.  So...I enjoyed this epi and the ending...Hmm???  I've no idea what the hell happened.  A cliffhanger...darn it...when is the next episode. LOL.,1292025600,,567,4.968085106382978
4148471,4,B003L77GG0,"Season 10 in some ways brings back some of what was lost over the last couple of seasons (so far). Smallville was getting boring and bland with forgettable episodes spaced in between the main storyline. The climax of Season 8 with Doomsday was so disappointing after a season that you were sure was going to lead to a finale that was spectacular. Zod in season 9 was a better season finale, but was an annoying character that wasn't fully realized and you found that you just didn't care.

Now we get to season 10, the final year, and we are seeing some of the old Smallville again. Some old characters are coming back and there's so far only one episode that I found boring and a reminder of the last couple of seasons. The creators of the show know this is the last hurrah and as the season plays out you are seeing more and more of that as they go down paths that they probably wouldn't have tried in earlier seasons.

The fight scenes still are a weak point, which is the way its always been, with only a few exceptions. Its a tv show with a limited budget so unfortunately we usually don't get to see Clark kick ass as much as we would like to.

I'm personally happier that Chloe is out of the picture. The show seems to have improved with her character out of the way. Lois is still a great character and now that she knows about Clark that has made the story so much better. Ive always liked Green Arrow, though sometimes it feels like they want him to be a main character in the show, but they don't always know what to do with him. I like Tess Mercer far more in season 10 than I did in earlier seasons. She was very annoying early on, but has developed into something very important to the show.

I do wish we had more interactions with other super heroes. They seem to show up infrequently here and there and nothing much seems to happen when you are really expecting some bad ass fight when you get these people together. I'm still looking forward to a big Justice League fight with as many of the good guys as they can shove into one episode

While there has not really been anything stated, you can see season 10 leading up to the return of Lex Luthor as the final showdown.

Season 10 is definitely better than 8 or 9, and even some of 7, but this series really needs to go out with a bang. No holding back, balls to the wall to give it the series finale it so deserves.",1291766400,,2385,4.230769230769231

I hope each of you carries on with notable projects and that you'll be with me in many interesting ways for years to come.  I am trying to to be sad - that will come in the months ahead.  What a body of work and so honestly played that I feel I know you just as I did the Cartwrights of years past.  Well done!  Thank you again for an awesome decade!",1291420800,,573,3.9391304347826086
4148473,5,B003L77GG0,"OMG, I didn't think it could get any better, but it did.  I was riveted from the moment it started.  Doppleganger Clarks....much better than Red Krypto Clarks.  Much more contrast between good and evil.  I'm not going to say much more cuz I'm at a loss for words.  This is a must see....
edited 7 Jan 2011:  I just saw this again and I'm still blown away by how freakin good it is.  Tom Welling shines in this episode.  I'm so glad he was chosen to play Clark Kent in this series.  I can't see anyone else playing this role...ever.  It'll be weird seeing someone else in the role on the big screen...same goes for Erica Durance as Lois Lane.  This episode ROCKS....you gotta see it!!!",1291420800,2,684,4.349206349206349
4148474,5,B003L77GG0,When I saw this episode...it took my breath away.  It is the most perfect episode I've ever watched on TV.  I don't know how to describe it other than to say...pure perfection.  If there was anything I didn't like about it...it was that it ended because I could have watched more of the same.  This is a series that should not be missed.  What's amazing about this...is that their 100th episode was just as perfect.  For those people who think...ah...this is just a silly show about Superman and the comic book figures he fights...Stop...you're wrong.  This is a character driven show as much as it is a plot driven show.  The producers/writer's have done the rare thing of combining great storytelling on a weekly basis with great/rich characters that you can love/hate.  You see the best of the best (Clark Kent) and the worst of the worst (Lex Luthor) and some people in between. Don't miss this perfection!,1290902400,,910,4.708860759493671
4148475,5,B003L77GG0,"I have watched this show from the very first episode.  I have truly enjoyed every episode of season 10 so far. I my humble opinion this is by far the best season.  This season finally made want all the seasons on dvd.  The sets normally cost 59, 48 or 42 dollars.  They were too pricey for me to catch up or so i thought. Thank God I decided I wanted the sets during the holiday season. I waited for Black Friday hoping for a deal. I found the perfect price and  acquired seasons 1-9 of this show from Best Buy on Black Friday for $ $9.99 each. Now I can watch this show whenever I want. This is still no consolation I will miss the show when it ends.  I  will also miss the actors that made this show great. I wish them the best in their future endeavors.  I will watch all the  seasons (especially season 10, if I can find it for $9.99 next Black Friday )with a smile on my face.",1290816000,11,881,4.017241379310345
4148476,5,B003L77GG0,"I almost don't know what to say about this episode.  It was freakin wicked good.  I didn't really think they could make an episode that would actually make me tense...but they did with this one.  The Darkside character is probably the best villain they could have come up with to end this series. Just alluding to this character made me tense.  Look...if you haven't seen a single episode of Smallville..you are missing a lot.  You need to start from season 1 epi 1 and work you way to here.  This is the best series on TV for pure storytelling.  If you don't like this series...then I don't know what entertainment means to you cuz this is entertaining.  Oh, and did I mention that the talented Tom Welling directed this episode!!!",1290816000,2,732,4.576923076923077
4148477,5,B003L77GG0,"I just saw this epi again and I enjoyed it even more this go around.  I have to say one of the more special scenes was the end with Clark and Jonathan Kent.  It brought tears to my eyes to see how Clark, in his confusion and disappointment, leaned on his father as he had so many years before for guidance.  It was odd because I was transported back 10 years looking at Clark and ""dad""...it was as if the years had not passed the way they slipped comfortably into their roles and Clark, despite knowing that he has matured these past 10 years, seemed to me to be that young man that started this series.  Yes he looks older but the look in his eyes as he looked at Jonathan reminded me of a young Clark.  It was an amazing achievement for Tom Welling to bring back this part of Clark to the screen. This is a special series with specail actors.  I am sad that this is their last year for the series.",1290729600,9,899,4.1085714285714285
4148478,5,B003L77GG0,"I've been watching Smallville since it's premier on October 16th 2001. Lets be honest folks, this series started out so strong, it just wasn't really Superman like... in the beginning. That doesn't make it bad tho, it all comes together in due time. Character development on this show has been superior to most other shows. I put the characterization level to Joss Whedon's Buffy: Anya and Cordelia (through Angel) who have been 2 of the most fleshed out characters in my television watching history. Each character on this show has his or her own place, and their development is top notch. The show finally develops into what it will become in season 4 and the introduction of Lois Lane. Smokin hot Erica Durance!!!! Her chemistry with Tom Welling has been undeniable since she first found him in that field. Unfortunately (And fortunately) Season 7 brought about the end of creators Al Gough and Miles Millar's run on the series! This is bad, as they are fantastic with what they do, and how they kept the pace of the show. Also bad because season 8 Smallville is by far the weakest season under the Smallville belt. It felt pushed, the acting was slippery and the plot had more holes than a 5lb chunk of Swiss Cheese... The Doomsday fight alone was cringe-worthy enough to nearly destroy the entire show, that is until season 9 kicks off... Which is when all the GOOD starts happening despite Gough and Millar's exit. Once the new producers (maybe new writers?) found their groove, they grooved all the way to the bank.... Season 9 exploded into my favorite season of the show. With so many guest stars and new characters... Season 9 looked to be the best, and then..... SEASON 10 has been blowing my mind. The progression that we've all been waiting for has finally arrived... The show has hit it's stride, and it's so incredibly unfortunate (not to say I don't understand) that with S10, we will be rid of Smallville, and that my friends is a melancholy moment, but I'm sure glad they are going out with a bang! If you haven't seen any Season 10 yet... just you wait, it's tops! As a series... it's one of my all time favorites along with Buffy, Angel, Desperate Housewives and Brothers & Sisters. I find it hard to put these 5 shows in any kind of order, they are all fantastic!",1290124800,137,2284,4.614250614250614
4148479,5,B003L77GG0,"This season keeps bringing in old faces and new surprises. I absolutely loved this episode for a number of reasons. We get to see that Lois's mother is played by the actress, Teri Hatcher, who played Lois herself in the 90's series, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" and we also got to see both of Clark's parents together. My favorite thing about this episode was the background storyline we got to see on Tess Mercer. Wow. What a shocking ending that was! This is easily the best season yet for Smallville and I love the direction each storyline is headed. Superior job!",1289692800,,587,4.6
4148550,2,B003L77GG0,"This episode sure seemed pretty hacked to me. Clark saves Tess from battling Granny Goodness's soldiers, and suddenly he's back at the farm looking for Lois. What happened with the Orphanage? Did they just leave all the kids there? What about the little girl he left in the electrical room? If we're to assume they did call authorities and shut it down, how did Granny escape? Tess is trying to dial for help on an old rotary phone in the Orphanage. They have all this cutting-edge technology in the Watch Tower, but she doesn't have a cell phone? Why would granny leave the ballerina music box in Tess's room when she could have, oh, I don't know, grabbed Tess instead?  Huge holes abound.

I'm a fan of the series, but man, this episode was a mess.",1289692800,,750,4.507352941176471
4148551,4,B003L77GG0,Been waiting a long time to see Clark and Lois get to this point in their relationship so the crazy blue meteor-infected religious fanatics that dominate most of the episode are welcome in that they only serve to cement Lois and Clark's epic romance.,1289174400,,250,4.704545454545454
4148552,5,B003L77GG0,"This series is the best series if you want to see how superman grew up and how the Justice League of America came about.  This series keeps all the movies, the comics and the series with George Reeves, in check.  The only complaint that I have with the series is that they bought Lois Lane in the series too soon.  Remember, Clark only got to know Lois when he left Smallville and went to Metropolis to work for the Daily Planet.  Other than that, that is the only complaint/negative complaint that I have with the show.  So sit back and enjoy the show and even this is the last season for the show, hopefully it will the best season ever and leave an opening for The New Adventures of Superman!!!  Who knows!  Enjoy the show.  Best of lick to this winning series.",1288310400,5,764,4.330985915492958

4148554,5,B003L77GG0,This is by far one of my favorite episodes of the entire Smallville Epic. I've been a Smallville fan since 2005 and own every season. I was hit off guard to see the return of Brainiac from season 5 and the role he plays in opening up Clarks eyes in this episode. It was also a great idea for the Smallville High School Reunion and the flashbacks from the past. This episode was filled with fun and i enjoyed every minute.,1287187200,4,421,4.209876543209877
4148555,1,B003L77GG0,"After not watching smallville for a while I decided it was time to start up again. Needless to say I was disappointed. Lois is some undercover superhero that goes from a chauffer to a stripper and amazingly (not!) she knew her way around a club she had NEVER been to, stole a costume, managed to find a wig and ta da she was seducing the bad guy. They made the Lois character with too big of a head, Clark is too much a wimp to amount to much. Smallville has gone way down with the addition of Lois and her character.

I am curious if this will survive after season 10....",1286668800,9,572,4.153153153153153
