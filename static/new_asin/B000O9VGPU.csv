8184125,5,B000O9VGPU,"What a wonderful set! It's all the Robotech you've ever wanted. 7 box sets each containing 3 individual dvds. Some say Robotech is inferior to Macross. I argue that it is simply an American interpretation that has it's good points and bad. Yes the violence is dumbed down a bit, but I don't think the story really suffers from it. This is a classic.
