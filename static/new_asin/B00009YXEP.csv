1898607,1,B00009YXEP,"The cover of this trash is deceiving, the killer in the movie looks nothing like what was on the cover. The cover actually looked kind of cool, but there was nothing cool about this movie. It tried to be scary but it failed big time. I realy enjoyed one scene in particular where a woman gets startled by an unseen thing, then she starts screaming, gets out of the car, runs to the edge of a fence, screams help me please at an oncoming vehicle, the people keep driving buy, so then the woman runs back to the car, Thus me naming her the smartest person in the world. This is just an example of new low budget horror movies. They don't try anymore. Please stop making them. I want to see good horror movies come back.",1087171200,,717,4.240875912408759
1898608,1,B00009YXEP,"Once again, as a glutton for punishment, I rented this on a perfectly good Friday night.  The back of the DVD intrigued me, to paraphrase... ""two chicks.. a broken down car... a wacko... who will survive?...blah .. blah .. blah""  Okay, so I figured It'd be a little like Jeepers Creepers or any of the typical ""lost on the highway and killed by a stranger"" flicks.  Unlike pointless hackfests involving two relatively good looking (and in this case, lesbian perhaps) women, this euro-junk didn't ""stoop"" to showing pointless nudity.  If it had, there might have been some redeeming value to the half hour country drive the female protoganists took.  I'll save you the cost of renting or buying this mess by spoiling its plot in three sentences.  Chicks drive into country in crappy car that breaks down.  One chick gets whacked by ""junior"" the other gets captured.  Chick breaks free whacks junior but gets whacked in turn by junior's dad.  The End.  This could have easily been distilled into an old episode of ""Tales from the Darkside"" or even ""Monsters"".  The movie dragged, and dragged and dragged on.
Endless scenes of English? countryside, poor paving and dialogue... oh man... can I please have a movie where the ""bad guy"" doesn't stand there and explain the entire freakin' movie in 5 minutes at the end?  ""i'm junior's dad... blah blah blah.. he was born deformed and evil...blah blah blah... here is the whole point of the movie!... blah blah blah""  That's why silence of the lambs was so cool, the freak in that movie didn't explain himself, he just did evil stuff to people and didn't give a care about what people thought. ::sigh:: 1 star people.  No Production value, no special effects, (unless you like phony chopped off rubber heads that leak Ketchup), awful and often ponderous dialogue.",1083628800,4,1805,4.818181818181818
1898609,5,B00009YXEP,"After a long day working at the local roller rink, I felt a need to watch a light hearted comedy about Conan the destroyer getting pregnant and hanging out with short actor danny devito. I thought of all the hilarity that may ensue from such a premise, such as jokes about morning sickness and male breast-feeding, so I roller skated over to the local video store to rent ""junior."" I browsed around and eventually found this movie. I figured the fact that a man wearing a mask and holding what looks like a miner's pick was all part of the joke, so I rented it. I simply figured that junior was just recently pregnant and not showing yet, and maybe he worked down in the coal mines all the live-long day, and possibly having some drinks after work with his little buddy.(devito)
Long story short, I'm so glad I did. This movie was HI-larious, and it really helped to ease my aching feet as I laughed the night away! I couldn't help chuckling at poor juniors' pregnant antics!(I felt kind of bad about this, but then I just reminded myself it is only a movie.) The scene where junior gets a face full of dirt thrown at him and falls over for about 3 minutes is sure to be a classic! I read later in people magazine that this is Charlton Hestons' favorite movie, and I don't blame him. I also read that this movie is an ""unofficial"" sequel to ""fried green tomatoes"", but I have been unable to confirm this rumor yet.
My only problem with this movie is an almost complete lack of aforesaid devito, although the scene he was in(the chicken scene)was very well acted and tastefully done.",1081900800,,1582,4.439862542955327
1898610,1,B00009YXEP,"I watch a lot of independent horror movies, and this is by far the worst one I have ever seen. It's so bad that it isn't even enjoyable to sit around with your friends and make fun of it. It oozes badness from every pitted contrived pore of its withered 90 minute bulk. There is not one moment in this entire movie that is the least bit inventive. The dialogue is so bad that you'll want to grind a pen in your ear until you feel the sweet embrace of permanent deafness. It's a hilariously low-budget combination of tired cliches from other, better movies. Now, I rented Junior, and after just ten minutes into the movie I began to suspect that I had made a terrible mistake. At the end, not only was I depressed that I had wasted five bucks, I was depressed that I had wasted nearly two hours of my life. The only scene in the movie that's worth anything at all is the bizarre car scene, and even that is ruined when we get to see the dumb monster that looks like something a sugar-addled middle schooler would draw in a textbook margin. If you buy this movie, you will live to regret it.",1063584000,3,1089,4.240384615384615
1898611,3,B00009YXEP,"""Junior"" tells of a lesbian couples unfortunate run-in with the title character at some off road area in a foreign country. The film tries to remind us of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and others of its ilk by portraying a disturbed family and various scenes of torture and unease. There are two main problems with the film; one, the first half hour or so is really boring as we retread old plotlines of getting lost and the car breaking down. Two, an overly, overly, overly long scene concerning one of the girls being harrassed by an unseen ""thing"" while in the car. This scene almost made me give up on the film but I am glad I stuck with it as things pick up considerably in the last half. This part of the presentation is truly disturbing and gruesome in a TCM kind of way and makes the movie worth watching. The title character is memorable as is his chosen instrument of destruction. Not a lot of gore but some things do get a little messy. Overall, ""Junior"" is no classic but has enough going on to make it worth your time.",1061337600,5,1031,4.375

7994553,2,B00009YXEP,"Unrecognizable accents in an unrecognizable location. Not even the stars know where they are. Sandra and Rebecca are friends. Really close ones. I mean to the point where I think it's a lesbian relationship. Unless they do things differently in Belgium (yes, I had to look it up). Their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and things go south from there. I can't imagine the first hour of the movie is more than a few script pages. Just agonizingly long, pointless scenes. Until there's a big exposition scene with the father. From there, it gets a tad interesting, hence the extra star. ""Junior"" himself, for having brain damage, is really quite agile. Like the guy is a dancer or something.",1357603200,,698,4.729508196721311
7994554,3,B00009YXEP,"The movie opens with a woman looking like she is preparing to go out, but instead hangs herself. After the opening credits, which are done in red so we know it will be a good movie, 2 women decide to go on a holiday. Their car breaks down. This is the first car I have seen overheat because they were trying to start it. Phones have dead batteries (they work later) and they can't read a map. One of them decides to go back to the service station for help while the other remains with the car...because they don't want anybody to steal it? European title is ""Engine Trouble."" But since ""Junior"" did so well in 1994, they opted for it.

A mechanic fixes the car with duct tape. Rebecca (Cecilia Bergqvist) drives back to the station but there is no Sandra (Marlene Simons). The sounds from within the gas station suggest that there is the proverbial man-creature locked up. Not much to figure out from here. All you have to do is to connect the creature to the suicide woman, have him get loose, give him a signature murder weapon or default chainsaw,  add a gratuitous shower scene and you got yourself a hit slasher film. But NOOOOOO! Apparently in Belgium they have a different idea on how to make a Slasher film, there is no shower scene! Otherwise pretty much what to expect from a slasher.

F-bomb, good sound track, no sex, no nudity, chained up women.",1319414400,2,1358,4.445783132530121
7994555,2,B00009YXEP,"My review: Not a good horror movie by any means. Oh, the box leads you to believe it will be but it's not! There is gore/blood which makes me give it a 2 star. In a nutshell-- 2 women go on a road trip and their car breaks down. Along comes a tow truck and they think they have been saved. Wrong. One woman gets killed and the other is left to face Junior..... a sad pathetic killer wearing a mask. We learn that it's junior's father that has made him this way. The remaining woman must fight to save her life. I'm glad I only rented this movie and didn't go out and buy it. I've seen worse but I've seen alot better!!",1141344000,3,618,3.9919354838709675
7994556,2,B00009YXEP,"I got this movie as a gift. I watched it about 2 months ago, and it was pretty disappointing. The movie has horrible sound, you have to turn your tv up full blast to even hear the darn thing! The scene where the one girl is in the car by herself with someone outside the car is ok, but a little silly too if you think about it! Some bad acting as well! The scene where the one passer-by says step on the gas, is absolutely horrible acting! Not an awful movie, but not really that good either!",1113177600,,492,4.030612244897959
7994557,3,B00009YXEP,"Junior was actually a pretty good horror flick. I remember seeing the cover saying okay its by Artisian its musn't be that bad. Well I popped it in and the first 10 minutes were horrible. The diaglougue in the beginning was just awful and the acting as well. However, soon the movie started getting good. It seems to me that someone noticed that the movie was bad so far and decided to take this film actually seriously. So It got really good as it progressed. The diaglougue and acting turned out decent. It did copy some scenes from some other movies though. However one scene that they copied was from Friday The 13th. This scene was great because I haven't seen any other movie that copied the same scene before! The ending was decent too. All in All, Junior was a decent movie. It was heading in the wrong direction at first, but then turned into the right direction!",1108425600,,872,4.490566037735849

7994559,1,B00009YXEP,"This movie is the worst of the worst. it smells like the most rancid road kill you ever encountered. if i had paid money to see this crap i'd be demanding a refund. as it is i was pissed off at free. (i belong to blockbuster all u can rent club at one price).

so unless you need help sleeping or you are really gullible skip this one kiddies its a snoozer.",1094256000,,357,3.9583333333333335
7994560,1,B00009YXEP,"This is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen, and not in the good-bad way (you know, so bad it's funny.) It was just abmysmally awful. The acting was beyond terrible, the supposedly ""retarded"" villain sure doesn't walk and move like any mentally impaired person I've seen (how could someone with severe brain damage be that handy with a sickle?), and I didn't get a single good scare. The scenes just dragged pointlessly on and on. However, the ""plot"" was incredibly simple, so if they had made good use of their time the movie would have been about 15 minutes long. I can't think of a single redeeming feature in the entire thing.",1092009600,,634,4.619469026548672
7994561,1,B00009YXEP,"That's right. Even the dump was too good of an area to throw this garbage away. Low budget, poor acting. Nothing good to write about this one.",1088726400,,142,4.296296296296297
