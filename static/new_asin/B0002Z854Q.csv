2152012,5,B0002Z854Q,"Television in the 60's was magic. A Hero could still be a Hero. And, if he was Daniel Boone, he could sing, and have a chorus in the background too!
Ken Tuck E is pure enjoyment. We meet the Boone family and friends, and watch Boone make new friends, including his soon to be best friend, Mingo. We're given a history lesson in the early days of the American Revolution.
Return now to the tales of yesterday, before the invention of the anti-hero, when a child could still dream of becoming more than what she/he was and performing great feats of heroic endeavor.",990230400,9,563,4.475728155339806
2152013,5,B0002Z854Q,"Too long absent from the TV screen, Fess Parker's Daniel Boone is back!  This high-quality video of the premiere episode is welcomed with great jubilation by the many, many fans who been asking, pleading, begging for the series to be released to video.  I love it, my kids love it, their friends love it.
One episode out of 165 is just the beginning!  More!  More!",974160000,8,364,4.553846153846154

2152022,3,B0002Z854Q,"Ok older movie from the 30s. Black and white. The fort looked original and the wagons crossing the river was wild.as far,as history; the story was not as extensive as I wanted. I wanted to see when Daniel Boone was issued land grant in Missouri. This movie covered the Cumberland Road.  I liked the renegade white trapper that with Indians attached the white settlers",1443139200,,367,4.734375

2152024,5,B0002Z854Q,"It took an eight-year war to move the British, but the America that emerged offered freedom few ever imagined for the individual wanting to chart his own course.
Missing from the history books are the names of the courageous who cleared the wilderness: DANIEL BOONE cleared wilderness from Tennessee to Kentucky to Ohio. When the Revolutionary War began, he organized Kentucky settlements against British and Indian attacks.
JIM BRIDGER: He mapped the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone, then blazed the famous Bozeman Trail between Nebraska and Missouri. He was also instrumental in opening up Oregon to settlers.
ANTOINE LEROUX: He blazed trails from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to San Diego, California, from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, Cakifornia.
And Bible-toting JEDEDIAH STRONG SMITH: He blazed trails for Californua-bound settlers.",1358035200,,840,5.469230769230769
2152025,3,B0002Z854Q,The DVD I viewed is from Miracle Pictures.  The print is quite worn and is just chock-full of splices.  The best print I know of is the Hal Roach VHS.  The VHS is easier viewing as the splices there are do not interrupt dialogue or the flow of the film.,1269129600,,253,4.02
2152026,3,B0002Z854Q,"this is a good movie but bad on parts with print and sound  but it is an old movie of the 30s but I do put it down to the quality of the disc . if its a good movie why do the companies turn them out  on cheap disc  and if its worth watching then its worth puting onto a good disc  the story is very good  and George O ' Brian is a great actor and always has a smile in his acting, for the price it could be better . maybe one day they will turn out a better copy. lets hope so. I will say It was a shame to have to return it as I do like O' BRIAN in westerns. I will keep searching for a better label",1253232000,,600,3.4477611940298507
2152027,5,B0002Z854Q,"Watched as a child in black and white. Looked forward to the night it came on, can't recall which night, and our entire family watched it. Ordered seasons 1 & 2 and am delighted that my 7 & 8 year old grandsons love to come over to watch ""Ol' Danl'"". Planning to order other seasons soon. Background is clearly not Kentucky,,,rather as one writer stated in the west. Today tv might  be more geographically accurate, but the history and watching the birth of our great nation helps to birth American pride in this younger generation, as was planted in us boomers. Maybe that's part of the problem. Our children aren't exposed to things that generate pride in America. We are still America!! Or is that  politically incorrect!!? I say,,,as do many of us who won't stand up...LET'S TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. DON'T LIKE IT HERE? GET OUT!!!",1209340800,,832,4.653061224489796
2152028,5,B0002Z854Q,It was great fun to watch this with our sons!  This was the pilot episode for the series starring Fess Parker.  We would like to purchase all of the episodes for the years the series ran (but have only found this one episode available so far).  We would like to see these available on DVD.,1126396800,8,289,4.218181818181818
2152029,5,B0002Z854Q,This is a great movie classic of the legendary American pioneer Daniel Boone. It's a must see!!!!!!!!!!!,1118620800,,104,5.176470588235294
2152030,5,B0002Z854Q,"I agree with the other reviewers, this is great family entertainment that you aren't ashamed of letting your kids and family see. I think all the baby boomers and even some of the kids of today would enjoy seeing this series on DVD or at least VHS.
Please pass this on to the ones who decide what is coming out next on video.",1085270400,5,325,4.174603174603175
2152031,5,B0002Z854Q,simply one of the best tv shows of the 60s down to earth and very entertaining. i have been in search of i think a disney daniel boone when he was not married to rebbeca but was on his way to discover ken-tuck.i seen it on tv in the mid. 60s but that was it. so far iam unable to fine.it stared fess parker and ed ames.,1035072000,7,319,3.7761194029850746
2152032,5,B0002Z854Q,One of the best TV Shows of the 60's. I hope more Fess Parker Daniel Boone shows will be available. This was pure entertainment. I have wondered for years why this program was not out on tape. During those years we watched it every week. Those were heroes you could cheer for. I would like to own all the Daniel Boone TV shows. I hope Amazon.com will be able to offer more of these. Harry at Vidayo did a top notch job getting the tape to us.,1026259200,11,442,4.091954022988506
2152033,5,B0002Z854Q,"As several have said, Fess Parker was a better Daniel Boone than a Davy Crockett. Oh well, he was Davy only four or five times, and Daniel about SIX YEARS. Practice does make perfect. This is a good video for nostalgic reasons and fairly believable acting. If you are a historian who nitpicks about accuracy, then don't watch. It was amazing to see Plains TeePees intermingled with East Coast wigwams. Some of the tribal costume was out of place as well. Oh yes, some of the ""Indians"" needed a little more berry juice for complexion.
Other than that, this is an excellent video. It is very family oriented(Daniel does not take the Indian wife that is offered to him because Becky is waiting back home), his family always runs to meet him, and gets angry if he has to leave again. He tells stories to his children, and sings to the Missus.
Yes, there is some violence and killing and probably excessive, but Dan'l doesn't kill unless it is to protect someone, and tries avoid it if possible.
These things just are not done in films today, and if they are attempted they just don't have the same spirit.
This video(may there soon be more!!) also gives our children a chanced to see a program that excited us when we were young. everyone has seen all the Peanuts cartoons, and odds and ends of famous sci-fi, but this is a simpler life video.
It is also great to see familiar faces we haven't heard from in years like Ed Ames, and did anyone notice George ""Goober Pyle"" Lindsay up on the stockade wall during the battle?
AHHHH for the days of clean, if very inaccurrate historical stories. Yes we were very prejudiced in those days, but I think things like this were the beginning of racial acceptance.",1017273600,15,1699,4.537459283387622
