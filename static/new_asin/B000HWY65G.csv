8141584,4,B000HWY65G,"There is good information to be gleaned from this video. However, the host is very dry and slow at times.",1295481600,,105,4.3
8141585,5,B000HWY65G,"Great video.  I'm a general contractor & home inspector in Arizona.  The content of this film is informative, the quality of filming is good, the speaker's voice is clear.  His choice of words and phrases is worth writting down and using in future quotes and reports.  I highly recommend this film for instructing inspectors as well as a home owner / buyer.",1294099200,,357,4.709677419354839
8141586,2,B000HWY65G,"I am very impressed with the obvious knowledge and understanding of the interworkings of pools, spas and their structure and equipment that is demonstrated in this video.  My problem is that the subtitle is 'Safety and Maintenance'.  This video has little of what I consider routine maintenance of a pool.  The maintenance that is referenced is recognizing when structural maintenance is necessary on a pool such as when coping is loose, when caulking is cracked between the deck and the coping, when an electrical bond wire is loose and not giving adequate electrocution protection.  All of this is great information.  I merely assumed when the title included 'maintenance' that the contents would have a section that walked the viewer through a routine for pool maintenance.  It does not.  There is no discussion of chemical imbalances or algae nor steps for maintaining a pool, let alone a sequence.  I consider this good information in a general sense but wanted to clarify this specific point.  If you are interested in purchasing a property with a pool this would be an excellent primer to avoid buying a problem pool.  But you'll need different guidance for upkeep of your pool.",1283212800,,1185,5.0
8141587,5,B000HWY65G,As a Home inspector I found this video to be well done and extremely informative. I would recommend this video to all who would be interested in pool inspections.,1248912000,2,162,4.620689655172414
8141588,5,B000HWY65G,I find myself ordering and watching all of the Show Me How Videos designed for homeowners.  If these videos would have been available when I was a real estate broker I would have loaned them to all of my listing clients and they would have been able to make more money when they sold their house.  As a pool owner I would have saved several times the price of this video if i would have followed the video instructions from day one.  Better late than never.  Please make a show me how video about the mortgage lending process.,1174953600,3,526,4.336734693877551
