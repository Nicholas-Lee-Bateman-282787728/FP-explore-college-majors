8095357,3,B000C20VHS,"This is just a short reminder that this film is in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio - but is letterboxed, NOT ANAMORPHIC.  I have not heard of its studio planning an anamorphic release in the near future.",1315872000,,195,4.416666666666667
8095358,3,B000C20VHS,"Brand ( a dour, put-upon, hen pecked performance by Alex Van Warmerdam) is a kept husband who on top of his other failings, can neither read nor write. His demanding and successful wife Keets ( Annet Malherbe: portly of body and pushy of disposition) decides to hire Brand a tutor, Lena to teach him how to read and write. But witnessing the bonding of Lena and her husband, Keets projects into the future and sees babies: something that Keets cannot produce. And this is where the trouble begins.
Director Alex Van Warmerdam has very little on his mind here but to show us the quirkiness of the situation of the triangle of his characters, the wholesomeness of  goat's milk and the green pastures of the Netherlands.
""Little Tony"" is a slight film: one more of situation and character than of anything having to do with the social or moral. As such, it is a minor success: quaint, humorous and profoundly anti-establishment.",1207958400,5,925,4.745341614906832
