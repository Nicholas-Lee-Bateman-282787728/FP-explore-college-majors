7874928,3,6304618077,"It's a decent transfer but only contains the first two Star Trek blooper reels... four reels actually exist. The ""bonus"" bloopers from various other classic TV shows is so-so, the highlight being Soupy Sales who gets a surprise eyeful of strip-o-gram hooters. The best thing about this item is the professionally made box - don't expect much quality from the tape itself. It would have been more worth the expense if all four Star Trek blooper reels were included, not a bunch of filler from other shows.",1449532800,,504,4.804597701149425
7874929,5,6304618077,"I first saw these bloopers at an event in the early 70's - it wasn't called a convention then and was nothing like what happens today.  It was just a bunch of fans sitting in chairs in front of a raised dais with a movie screen. It was more like a traveling show than a convention - Gene Roddenbery himself was there and introduced the blooper reel - where they also screened the original pilot episode ""The Cage"" with Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike which up until that point no one had seen before except as the edited 'Menagerie' episode.  As for the blooper reel, we fans saw it a time when VHS and DVD did not exist.  The only way to see this reel was at a convention and it was on film, not video.  We were told that the editing crew had thrown this together using unprocessed outtakes (hence the poor quality) and that it had only been seen up until that time by those associated with the show at parties etc.  It was never originally intended for public distribution and so has none of the slick production values that prepackaged bloopers have today.  Some years after the convention when VHS had become a common way of watching films I obtained a bootleg version of the blooper reel and still have it today.  The VHS case has a photocopy of Spock's face on a hand cut out piece of paper.  It was not until many years later that you were able to purchase the blooper reel commercially.  This blooper reel is a piece of TV history and should be watched in the context that saw it's creation.",1273795200,,1510,4.364285714285714
7874930,5,6304618077,"I must admit surprise at all the negative reviews on this video.
There was a time when all manner of entertainment was not ""Digitally mastered"" (!)
Cripes! These are rare!
These scraps and pieces were headed for the trash can, not video distribution in the 21st century.
I first saw them at a Convention in the late 80's and, yes, they look hazy, sometimes dark, scratchy, broken and, -are in no particular order.
The video is very entertaining.",1203724800,2,445,4.717948717948718
7874931,1,6304618077,"I am glad that my wife and I borrowed this from the library instead of spending any money on it.  15 minutes of clips edited together in a mish mash and then 45 minutes of other content.  The quality is poor - I suppose if you are a addict it is a ""must"" but this clip show is almost an insult to the series.

The best production value on the tape was the nicely produced affiliate reel at the end where they showed flubs and outtakes of other shows (not trek) in black and white.  The rest.  Just a clip show, and labeling it Star Trek Bloopers might as well be false advertising.

15 minutes of Star Trek piece togethers ... gags by the editor as well as real bloopers.  That's the only trek connection.

CAUTION: Tape contains nudity (non-trek).",1101945600,2,748,4.292857142857143
7874932,4,6304618077,"This is the infamous Blooper Reel.  Yeah, the picture quality is horrendous.  No, it's not especially funny.
But it is exactly as I remember seeing it at a Philadelphia Star Trek convention in 1978.  Right down to the dark images on the projection screen.
Its real value to a Trekker is that it's part of Star Trek history.  Most of the early fans watched this at conventions.  Foundational books such as ""The World of Star Trek"" (David Gerrald) to ""The Making of Star Trek"" (Stephen Whitfield) positively gushed over the Blooper Reel.  So, for better or worse, you too can share in that experience with this video.
Think of it as primary research.  It doesn't have to be pretty.  It just has to be.

7874933,3,6304618077,"Of COURSE it looks and sounds bad! It is true - these were eventually rejected and trashed, folks. I saw them over 15 years ago, and the quality was just as bad then. This isn't a video for most people, it's for us die-hard TOS fans who love trivia and oddities concerning the series. If you are willing to accept it for what it is, it is certainly watchable and actually quite humorous. I guess we should be thankful that Mr. Roddenberry decided to save them in the first place, no matter how they were mistreated later on. As far as I know, these are the ONLY bloopers of TOS in existence.",1022371200,4,591,4.285714285714286
7874934,4,6304618077,"I have done a little research and my understanding is that the STAR TREK outakes on this video were obtained directly from film stock found the dumpsters outside of the facilities where the show was edited. This means that they are vary rare and to my knowledge, don't exsist in any other public collection of Star Trek Bloopers. Unfortunately, this also means that that their veiwing quality is marginal because of their exposure to the outside elements. However, if you are a die hard Star Trek fan/collector (like many people I know), just possessing these rare and funny outakes more than makes up for their quality.
As for the the quality of the bonus bloopers, they are great, and are guarenteed to make you laugh until your sides ache.",1001203200,6,742,4.75968992248062
7874935,1,6304618077,"Whoever produced this tape should be ashamed. It is an awful rip-off for Star Trek fans. I think someone sat in a theatre and videotaped the screen to come up with such poor quality, grainy, dark, in-audible material.  I  had high hopes for a great package of bloopers. This is definitely not it.  Buyer beware!",919728000,8,311,4.618181818181818
