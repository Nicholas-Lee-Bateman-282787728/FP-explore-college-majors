7307181,4,B010CG2ECS,"Strong writing, an awesome idea and some excellent tension make this well worth a watch!
The horror genre needs independent and interesting voices like Craig Everett Earl.",1459382400,3,171,5.37037037037037

7307213,4,B010CG2ECS,"A small budgeted horror film of what can go wrong when you call the wrong person at the wrong time. Holly, a very beautiful actress played by Kate Stanley, is still depressed from her break up with her wonderful boyfriend a year earlier. Hollys semi-cute friend decides to play a game that will cheer up Holly. The game centers on crank calling guys and ask if they remember bumping their taco awhile back! They get the guy on the other end of the phone going, then hang up. When its Hollys turn she calls a man and begins to get into it about being with him awhile back until he turns the tables on her and says her name and knows her number since he has caller ID. Holly doesnt think twice about it, hangs up, and forgets about it. Not understanding in reality the man on the other end has just got done brutally killing his wife and her lover she was cheating with. The man decides to stalk and kill anybody close to Holly until he can have her all to himself. This horror film has all you could want in a small budget: Hot lead actress, boobies, lots of blood, and holy s*** a plot thats worth actually paying attention too!",1464652800,2,1128,4.275700934579439

7307215,1,B010CG2ECS,"This one has high-school film project written all over it. Non-actors reading cue cards and terrible camera work make for a really wretched ""horror movie"" experience. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess.",1463443200,,206,5.088235294117647
7307216,4,B010CG2ECS,"This movie is not great in the beginning but then it gets better and better.  The girl in it is cute and the guy with the knife is scary.  I felt sorry for him when I found out his motive.  I like the surprise ending.  True it does look like some cheap movie, but it held my attention till the end.",1461196800,2,298,3.8360655737704916
7307217,1,B010CG2ECS,How did this ever get 4 stars? Story line stunk and acting was just terrible. Don't watch this dumb movie.,1461024000,,106,4.35
7307218,1,B010CG2ECS,"It looked like it was filmed in a day with a jumbo bag of stale Fritos, Cheetoes, and two liters of safeway brand Mountain Dew with no fizz at the catering table for food.  I've seen yukky extremely low budget movies before but this one takes the cake.  I had to shut it off after 10-15 mins, as it was so boring and stupid.  The only reason someone gave it more than 1 star was probably due to Holly in a towel or something.  If you want soft core, then watch soft core.  However, if you want a seriously good slasher/gore film, watch *****""Simon Says""******.  Its a new cult classic that has sexy eye candy on top of sexy eye candy for both sides, and is one of the best chop 'n guts movies to ever come out in the last 10 years.  Simon Says is a very high budget, theater quality movie that is currently being shown here on Prime.  What Simon does to that rolled ""fatty"" that as big as a huge salami and how he puts it to the stoner dude is classic and will go down in history as extremely epic.  Watch it just for that, but also watch it because its so good.

Now, DONT watch Intrusion.  Its seriously cheap looking and sounding with one of the lowest budgets ever for a movie.  The only horror is how anyone could spend money on making something this bad.  If you watch it, you'll be sorry..",1460937600,2,1296,4.156626506024097
7307219,1,B010CG2ECS,"Strictly amateur hour.  Bad writing, bad lighting, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad casting, bad camera angles, bad editing, bad costumes, bad make up and bad special effects (i.e. cherry syrup looking ""blood""), bad directing.

8721882,5,B010CG2ECS,"As a lover of independent horror, I understand that producers don't have all the tools that big studio productions have. This film works with what it has available and manages to pull of an entertaining slasher flick. A young woman named Holly, pulls a prank call on a man who has just murdered his wife and her lover. Being in an unstable state of mind, the man develops an obsession with Holly and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Katie Stewart delivers the best performance and carries the movie on her shoulders. These characters feel like real people and you watch them go about their lives, not knowing the danger they are in. The film is well shot and looks great. Well worth a watch.",1502755200,,696,4.488188976377953

8721887,4,B010CG2ECS,"When it comes to the horror/suspense genre I think there is a growing misconception about what is important to make the experience. With growing movie budgets and reliance on special effects, even lower budget films are being strained by viewer expectations.

Intrusion is by all accounts an indie film, and one that is a starting point for something greater than itself. The film itself does sadly suffer from some growing pains, as neither the director, nor the actors quite seem polished enough to shake off the first pass vibe it gives from the beginning. Thankfully, this doesn't mean the film itself is bad, as it is a prime example that budget doesn't make a story, the story makes the story. Centering around Holly, a young woman who becomes the target of a psychopath after a phone prank goes terribly wrong, is a simple but elegant concept that doesn't require much to set the stage for the drama. This also leaves a great deal of time to establish who each character is, and why these people are who they are.

This is absolutely one of the films strongest elements, as it cannot rely on its budget to distract viewers from not having to worry about character development. While the film does touch a number of aspects of her life, it doesn't ever forget that something is lurking in the background. This keeps the psychology of film moving forward, while letting the audience learn about Holly and what meaning those around her have. This not only helps push the film forward, establish context for decisions made, but also adds life to the supporting cast.

If you are into the indie horror/suspense/Thriller then you will want to give Intrusion a shot, but the biggest draw will be for fans to prepare for the sequel, Intrusion: Disconnected which looks to have learned quite a bit from this first offering.",1465603200,2,1821,4.7746031746031745
8721888,5,B010CG2ECS,"This is a great horror film takes place in my hometown, with local actors and crew. It's not a big budget Hollywood film, but it's definitely not a high school student film project. Without a doubt worth watching and seeing for yourself. Can not wait for the follow up coming soon.",1465430400,3,281,4.529411764705882
