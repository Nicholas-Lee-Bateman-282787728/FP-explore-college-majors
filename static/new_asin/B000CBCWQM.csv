2455143,5,B000CBCWQM,"If you like classic old Christmas shows this is too good of a deal to pass up! The set includes 3 DVDs that individually sell for almost as much as this 3 DVD set.  All three are very famous Christmas specials that relive much simpler times; ""Hope For The Holidays"" with Bob Hope and several great guests; The Sonny & Cher Christmas Special; and the 1978 Christmas show with a very young looking Donny and Marie.  Depending on your attitude they all look very retro or a bit hokey, but it is good clean family fun for Christmas.",1227830400,9,528,4.377551020408164

8096638,4,B000CBCWQM,"I really loved this dvd . I only gave it 4 stars because, despite saying it has been remastered, there is a little issue with clarity( not bad however) I enjoyed it so much, and would definitely recommend it to others. It is a great addition to my dvd library.. The meet Corliss archer episode was a little silly for me, but all the others were so good. I don't even remember racket squad, (kind of like dragnet) but really enjoyed those 2 on the dvd. If you like old movies and a good detective story, you cant go wrong here.",1364688000,,526,4.217821782178218
8096639,5,B000CBCWQM,Will be a Christmas time show to watch every year in our house.  Was a great Christmas present to my hubby.,1339545600,,107,4.095238095238095
8096640,3,B000CBCWQM,"Some of these episodes have better transfers, others worse. And some of them have a decidedly more ""Christmasy"" feel to them. The Annie Oakley episode in particular wasn't one that you'd really sit down on Christmas Eve to watch, and the Robin Hood one had little if anything to do with the holiday at all. But the ""Date With an Angels"" episode--starring a youthful Betty White--might make the purchase worthwhile by itself (though it does appear on a better DVD collection offered by Amazon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-TV-Classics-Vol-2/dp/B000B5XPG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas TV Classics, Vol. 2</a>. Despite the poor transfer, the Burns and Allen ep also is a solid offering.

I've been buying up old TV episodes on DVD for several years ago, and if you enjoy that sort of thing as I do, go ahead and buy this. You won't be sorry because it's inexpensive.",1247961600,13,927,5.574468085106383
8096641,5,B000CBCWQM,"A great collection of Christmas shows, Bob Hope, Sonny & Cher, and Donnie & Marie & families.  I was uncertain since individually they were somewhat pricey - as a package so much cheaper, almost too good to be true.  But they are absolutely fantastic, great quality and so entertaining.  I love all three selections.  A great buy.",1231977600,,330,4.7368421052631575
8096642,4,B000CBCWQM,"I really enjoyed this set.  The Hope and Osmond shows are wonderful - a bit cheesy, but that is what I expected, so no disappointment there!  The Sonny & Cher shows were a bit somber, not at all what I expected.  I suppose they intended to treat the season with respect, etc., but after seeing their variety show, their specials weren't quite my cup of tea. The quality of all 3 DVDs are great, and in the end I'm glad I got the set.",1231718400,,433,4.130952380952381
8096643,3,B000CBCWQM,The Bob Hope DVD was terrific it gave you a great feel for the old days. The Sonny and Cher was surprisingly sort of not very good. We were expecting the usual laughs and great music but was some what disappointing. The Donny and Marie was very good. I would recommend for any one looking to experience the good ole days.,1231632000,,321,4.278688524590164
8096644,5,B000CBCWQM,"Every year on Christmas Eve, our family opens a couple early gifts, break out the eggnog, gather around the fire and watch some classic holiday movies. This is definitely one of those timeless gems that holds value and magic, no matter how many years these stars have been off the air. It just wouldn't feel like the holiday season without Bob Hope. And for those that want to re-live some real fun times, Sonny & Cher, and the  Donnie and Marie editions really bring back some memories. Glad we found this!

But this three DVD set Christmas special is a must for anybody who loves classic television, Bob Hope, Sonny & Cher and Donny & Marie. Three DVDs - for this price - you really can't beat it.",1227830400,4,255,4.019607843137255
