8749758,3,B01BBAATPS,"there is a problem with the description.  It names 2 movies then says ""+ 6 movie set"".  this says to me that there are eight movies.  there are only 6.  Now there are 6 bond films from the normal producer but there is a seventh ""never say never"" not included in this package possibly because it is from a different producer..  i do not think this was deceptive but was badly phrased.

At any rate it was good to again see the tech marvels that fascinated me as a teenager.",1466726400,,472,4.188888888888889
