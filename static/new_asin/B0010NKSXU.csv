8238043,1,B0010NKSXU,"Was forced by Amazon's automated system to give it a star, but does not decerve even that.  Received it quickly.  Does not state it is anything other than a normal DVD, BUT won't play on mine or family's player, ""unreadable"".  Sent it back to Amazon, they sent another, and IT WON'T PLAY.  Will have to get yet another label, pack it up, and return this copy also.  What a hassle.  Will have to ask for a refund.

A pleasure to the ears and to the eyes.",1234051200,,237,4.804878048780488
