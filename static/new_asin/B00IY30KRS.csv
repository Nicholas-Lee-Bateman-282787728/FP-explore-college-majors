6305058,5,B00IY30KRS,"I first became aware of this duo when I watched a TV aired concert highlighting the music from the movie
""Inside Llewyn Davis"".  The first time I heard them, I was hooked.  Their guitar work is exceptional.  The
marriage of their harmonies is above reproach.  I have their CD's and listen to them a lot.  I strongly
recommend this DVD and any of their CD's",1403913600,,356,4.415384615384616
6305059,5,B00IY30KRS,"I found this video to be lively and entertaining. I've loved the music of the Milk Carton Kids ever since my first viewing of Showtime's video ""Another Day/Another Time,"" which celebrates the music from the film ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" produced by Joel and Ethan Coen. In that video, they sang their song ""Snake Eyes"" and had several guys at the rehearsal--including the Coens--wiping their eyes. That's because, for many of us Boomers, the music of these two young artists evokes powerful memories of Simon and Garfunkel. It's like hearing them all over again. The Milk Carton Kids' voices blend just as soulfully, and they're gifted songwriters as well. Their playful interactions provide insights into their lives, their careers, and their music. If you haven't yet heard this duo--or even if you have--the video will delight.",1403568000,3,828,5.140740740740741
6305060,5,B00IY30KRS,This was a gift for a friend and he loved it. They are a wonderful group and It arrived right on time.,1402876800,,102,3.6818181818181817
6305061,5,B00IY30KRS,"To be short and to the point. Great harmonies reminiscent of Simon & Garfunkel and the Everly Brothers. Great sense of humor - dry and understated. Buy all their stuff, it's all great.",1402617600,,184,4.606060606060606
6305062,5,B00IY30KRS,"I appreciated the two longer reviews and won't repeat.  I just saw this group live last night for the first time, and this morning I downloaded the two free albums from their website and bought the new one on iTunes.  This evening we rounded it out with renting this DVD.  I agree that this group can't be compared to anyone, but mixing Simon and Garfunkel with Nickel Creek gives a hint of the sound, but the talent and creativity are completely unique.  The lyrics have depth and are heartfelt; the harmonies are so perfect it's like one sound.  As one reviewer mentioned, the DVD (over the music albums) allows the enjoyment of Joey's unique brand of humor, not to mention an up close look at Kenneth's incredible guitar work.  Don't miss this!  What a uniquely talented duo!",1402099200,,778,4.635036496350365
6305063,5,B00IY30KRS,A wonderful performance! Gives a great feel of how it is to see them live. These two are very talented.,1400198400,,103,4.2
6305064,5,B00IY30KRS,"This music is just striking and amazing in so many ways.  No gimmicks, no smoke and mirrors, no over-the-top production - just two guys with guitars singing songs with substance.  The blending of their voices is so seamless that it belies the complexity of what they do.  The guitar work is unique and complicated, yet they make it look and sound so simple that I am hard pressed to think of anyone who does it this way or nearly so well.  The bonus here in a live DVD is the chance to watch a level of chemistry, charm and humor that they are able to convey with minimal theatrics.  It is clear that however opposite they claim to be, there is an underlying mutual respect that pervades everything. One might expect this of a band that has been around for more than a decade, but it is surprising to find it in a relatively new band.  This very fact makes me excited to think of what they will evolve into as time goes on and I am looking forward to being the beneficiary of much good music to come.  Well done indeed!",1399334400,10,1019,4.276041666666667
6305065,5,B00IY30KRS,"I was watching the credits to the movie ""Promised Land"" when I started listening to the song playing in the background. It felt like my music, the music I listened to and played when I was young in the 1960s.  The song was outstanding and finally the music credits listed, ""The Milk Carton Kids"".  The song, ""The Ash & Clay"" stuck in my mind, and I was on the internet in a flash.  I found that I could download their first two albums for free from their website.  I played the two albums on my laptop continuously as I worked.  Then I set a Google alert for anything about ""The Milk Carton Kids"" and I found them on Facebook, and as I heard more and newer recordings of the same songs I noticed that they were getting better and better.  They were experimenting and growing. I wrote a note on Facebook saying that they were going to have to re-record both ""Prologue"" and ""The Ash and Clay"" because they had surpassed what was available.  They had outgrown their recordings.  They either listened to me or figured it out for themselves because they released this DVD, ""Live From Lincoln Theater.""  They are a band that has to be seen live to get the full feeling of The Kids and what  they offer.  Their shows are more than just the songs.  There is Joey's wonderful droll sense of humor playing to Kenneth's curmudgeonly straight man.

I have tickets to see them in June in Napa, CA.  I can't imagine what the show will be like.  The DVD was recorded last October before they were picked up by the Coen Brothers and T Bone Burnett and the growth from their two albums is incredible.  These boys are just getting started.  Reviewers try to come up with analogies to Simon and Garfunkel and the Smothers Brothers meet the Every Brothers, but these are lame.  We have here ""The Milk Carton Kids"" who are just that.  Outstanding and unique!",1399075200,16,1837,4.446107784431137
6305066,5,B00IY30KRS,This is a great music video. Love the harmony of the Milk Carton Kids......similar to Simon & Garfunkle from years gone by.,1446508800,,123,4.636363636363637

6305069,4,B00IY30KRS,I saw these two on PBS (Austin City Limits and Sound Stage (I think)) - really enjoy them as people (very funny) and Everly Brothers meet Simon and Garfunkel harmonies and clean guitar work. I like watching them as I play guitar and like to follow what they are doing and when.,1440374400,,277,4.346153846153846

6305075,5,B00IY30KRS,"LOVE the Milk carton Kids. I've bought everything that's out since I heard them on Garrison Keiller. Saw them twice in Boston. Even better in person.  Their harmony is beautiful, and the lyrics are meaningful and tender and funny. Joey is hilarious when he starts talking, and as far as I'm concerned, Kenneth tops the guitar playing world at present.",1416009600,,351,4.85

Sold out show!!",1414281600,,68,4.3076923076923075
6305077,5,B00IY30KRS,"Without exception, this one of my favorite music DVD's that I own. I happen to discover them by accident on a Austin City Limits broadcast and have been a fan every since then. Yes, they do have a similar sound to Simon & Garfunkel or the Everly Brothers - a guitar oriented duet singing folk tunes - but that is where the similarities end. Their musicianship is stunning. Beautiful vocals along with excellent guitar playing makes for great listening. Their reflective lyrics are balanced by their light-hearted stage banter. If you enjoy folk music, this DVD is a must buy.",1413158400,4,575,4.76
6305078,5,B00IY30KRS,"These guys are the real deal. I am not just impressed with this live stage performance, at Lincoln Theatre, but with all the video footage available if you go to the trouble of searching it out. Joey Ryan sets up a rock solid rhythm and bass with in each song, and the rich tonal quality and warmth of the Gibson J45 is a corner stone for their sound. This allows Kenneth Pattengale the freedom to weave a never ending storyline of improvised counter melodies over the top, with his Martin 0-15. Fine song writing from each as individuals and when collaborating together. Extremely tight vocal harmonies and tasteful song dynamics. The sounds of a quartet, from two accomplished musicians. The package is complete. Would love to see these guys live in Australia (bring the family, kick back and have a holiday while you are here)",1412553600,2,829,4.724137931034483

6305082,5,B00IY30KRS,"I heard the Milk Carton Kids for the first time on PBS, Austin City Limits.  Whoa!  Who are these guys? Went on line and secured everything that is out there.  Live From The Lincoln Theater was a knock your socks off performance.  Can't wait for an appearance in Chicago.  Have been telling everyone about them, and all are genuinely impressed.  Hope they are together for a very long time, as they seem to get better and better.  I am quit certain you will be entertained if not blown over.

I have watched this DVD so many times I'm surprised it is not worn out.  I also have their CD's that I have downloaded to my mp3.  They were just touring the western states.  Most of these concerts were sold out.",1404777600,4,305,3.870967741935484

8646274,5,B00IY30KRS,"While this duo seems to be constantly compared to Simon & Garfunkel, you do yourself a disservice thinking that's what you'll hear. Yes, they harmonize beautifully and one is tall while the other is not, but for me that's where the resemblance ends. I saw them recently in Santa Cruz, CA, at a small venue, with no idea who they are or what they played. I left the theater simply stunned by what I heard; it was one of the best live performances I've yet seen, and I've seen many. Kenneth Pattengale's guitar work is flawless without being showy, and the harmonies are pitch perfect. This is not music you put on in the background while you putter (although that works, too), but art to be absorbed as only music can be.",1473811200,,720,4.462121212121212
8646275,5,B00IY30KRS,"I've only recently become aware of the Milk Carton kids, and I love their kind of music: close harmony, acoustic guitars without excess clutter. This is a good concert recording.

The only thing I didn't like was the repeated re-focusing of the camera. Most editors try to leave this on the cutting room floor.

I like the subtle differentiations in guitar technique: Joey finger picks or strums his Gibson, with only occasional use of a capo; Kenneth picks his Martin, and use his capo most of the time.

All in all, highly recommended",1467504000,,536,4.741935483870968
