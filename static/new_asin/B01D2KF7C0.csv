7696308,1,B01D2KF7C0,I don't understand why this show in not available in HD. It was shot in HD !! Hopefully I kept the 1080p on my computer.,1463184000,,120,3.84
7696309,5,B01D2KF7C0,"I was stoked when I found out that Scream would be turning into a TV series, and this is coming from a person who tends to stay away from horror movies, because I love to sleep at night in the dark. However, Scream has always been one of those horror films were it's not really scary it's more of a suspense. Anyways my favorite of the group is by far Brooke, she's a character where either many will love her, or hate her despite her being the fan favorite. I hope she survives season 2 as well, but everyone is disposable including Emma. I honestly, believe Brooke is the real soul survivor she's was attacked the most in season 1, and t looks like in season 2 she's going to get attacked again the most. Sydney was attacked the most and she lived, so this should be a good sign on Brooke's behalf.",1463011200,2,800,4.235294117647059

7696311,4,B01D2KF7C0,"I have loved the original Scream films for as long as I can remember. They hold a special place in my heart and, when I heard the films were being adapted into a television series, I was already excited about the possibilities of being able to watch a series based on the movies every week. Although divisive among fans of the films, I appreciate the TV series for what it is. It's on MTV and therefore meant to be targeted to a younger demographic and, while some of the acting is cringeworthy, the series still kept me entertained for the 10-episode run. There are a few memorable kills and, although the reveal of the Lakewood Slasher may not be as shocking as I would have hoped, the guessing game and the aftermath are fun nonetheless. Maybe it's the nostalgia that keeps me tuned in to this show, but I am excited to see where the show goes in season two. If you're on the fence, I say give the show a shot and try to take it for what it is, instead of constantly comparing it to the films that came before.",1462838400,,1013,4.28125
7696312,4,B01D2KF7C0,"Hidden around my blog, youll find a few reviews of one of my guilty pleasures  the slasher film.  While most of them are fairly bad, the one franchise Ive really enjoyed is the Scream movies.  (Yes, Im the weirdo who likes 3 and 4 while acknowledging they are much weaker than the first two.)  So when it was announced that MTV was going to create a TV show version of the franchise, I was in.  While definitely not as good as the movies, there is still plenty of fun to be had here.

Like the first movie, this film opens with a young woman (Bella Thorne) home alone at night.  However, her threatening messages come via text message and an ap.  This is the 21st century after all.  Oh, and she and her boyfriend had just released a video of a classmate.  Not that they get to enjoy any of the fallout from that video since they are our opening victioms.

When news of the brutal murder breaks the next day, the students at the school in town are understandably shocked and upset.  However, the killer seems to be contacting Emma Duval (Willa Fitzgerald) and teasing her with information about her mothers past.  It seems her mother (Tracy Middendorf) has a secret that someone is determined to reveal.  Does it have anything to do with the killings that took place 20 years ago?  As the body count begins to rise, Emma realizes she needs to solve this mystery if she wants to stay alive and protect her friends.

To be honest, this could have been called anything and it still would have worked well.  There is no connection to the Scream film franchise in character or looks.  Heck, the killer even wears a different mask.  While I did miss the iconic Ghostface mask, there is a reason for the mask the killer wears here, and I liked that aspect of things.

The one connection this has to the films is the tone.  The characters know they are in a horror story and reference the conventions of the genre every so often.  Its not as self-aware or biting as the first film, but it is fun.  They even make a nice reference to the first film in passing that I loved.

Blood thirsty fans will be disappointed with the toned down violence, but this is a TV show after all even if it is on MTV.  Frankly, I still found the deaths plenty bloody for my tastes, which are decidedly tame for a fan of the genre.  The chase scenes aren't as elaborate as a movie, but they still work well to build up some good suspense.

The biggest problem that a TV show of this nature has is how many characters to kill off and when.  While the recent show Scream Queens boasted about one death an episode, some of those killed were only introduced in the episode where they died.  This show went to the other extreme and had some episodes where no one died.  Im not sure which side is correct.  The episodes without any murders definitely advanced the plot and gave us plenty of tension, however, so I still enjoyed them.

At its heart, the Scream franchise has always been a mystery story (maybe one reason I like them), and we get some good twists and surprises on the way to unmasking the killer.  Im still not quite sure I buy that revelation, mainly because of the twist they put on screen during the final few moments.  Ill probably decide how I feel about it as season two unspools since it will have to address that.

And I will definitely be back since the characters are good.  The producers have said they had a hard time killing people off since they grew to love the cast and their characters, and I can see why.  While they initially fall into high school stereotypes, those who live long enough begin to be very real, which upped the tension on the show  I didn't want any of them to die either.  Obviously, this means the cast does a great job bringing them to life.

There were 10 episodes in the first season, and they are preserved here in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras include a gag reel and cut scenes.

While Scream  The TV Series won't appeal to everyone, fans who give it a chance will find themselves caught up in an entertaining, and deadly, story.  Im looking forward to seeing the next deadly chapter unfold soon.",1462752000,7,4140,4.390789473684211
7696313,4,B01D2KF7C0,"Being a huge fan of the Scream franchise, as soon as the TV show adaptation got announced I knew I couldn't miss it. I didn't expected it in any way to be better than the original movies but they did a pretty good job.
The show follows the same structure as the Scream movies (a group of teens being chased by an unknown but thirsty for blood killer and a mysterious murder that started all of it), with a storyline that brings many twists, turns and of course blood in an effective way. The amazing part of the show it's actually how well it pays homage to its original source, keeping some aspects but renewing others, giving a new and fresh look to the franchise. The show is fearless and no one is safe.
Although the first season has its flaws like when there isn't enough blood at points, or that the season one killer reveal might dissapoint some (including myself) or that sometimes the pace goes from good to incredibly slow (some episodes were like a teen soap and others were big blood baths full of mystery and creepy moments), ""Scream: The TV Series"" ends up being an amazing ride of 10-episodes that makes you want more and reminds you so much of the movies, in a nicely-adapted way.
Hopefully the second season corrects those flaws because the first season showed so much of the potential this show has. This show and DVD is a must for any Scream/horror fan! Give it a try. Don't let the MTV tag fool you.",1458604800,10,1419,4.419847328244275
7696314,5,B01D2KF7C0,The whole season is amazing trying to figure out who the killer or killers are will keep you in suspense for all 10 episodes,1458604800,6,124,4.208333333333333

7696316,5,B01D2KF7C0,"In the tradition of the original ""Scream"" movie franchise, Mtv's ""Scream - the TV Series"" is a suspenseful, sometimes terrifying ten episode thrill ride that grabs hold of its viewers from the first scene and leaves you craving for more.  The series is different from the films, as it takes place in the town of Lakewood with a new heroine, Emma Duval, (played by Willa Fitzgerald) whose life is torn apart after a viral video of her estranged childhood friend Audrey Jensen (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus) prompts a string of murders and uncovers a twenty-year-old mystery that Emma's mother (played by Tracy Middendorf) would have preferred to stay buried.

With a score and soundtrack that sets the tone perfectly, ""Scream -the TV Series"" has an outstanding ensemble cast, multiple story arcs and plot twists that will keep you guessing until the final, shocking reveal.  Highly recommended.",1458432000,16,891,5.089041095890411
7696317,5,B01D2KF7C0,"Normally I hate MTV, it's got terrible shows and the series that have plots are dry and horribly written. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHOWS! I watched all of season one as it came out and was blown away by it. This is an amazing show and should be seen, I'm worried about season two not being as good but I'll give it a chance. Watch this show no matter what though.",1458345600,13,363,3.9863013698630136
7696318,5,B01D2KF7C0,Great show that follows the winning formula of the movies of the same name. I was not sure they could make a slasher flick into a television show but they have pulled it off.,1482796800,2,174,4.147058823529412
7696319,5,B01D2KF7C0,"Not bad for a series, while I do give it 5 stars and say its not bad it still held a lot of mysteries & it didn't reveal who the killer was up to the last second.  Although it can leave a lot of openings for future plots for the future and I am hoping that continues on for some more seasons.",1482624000,,292,3.7096774193548385
7696320,5,B01D2KF7C0,"I hate MTV shows in general.  Normally I wouldn't watch this, but it was on Netflix and I'm a fan of slasher films (yes, some are very bad but for the most part I find them entertaining) and I liked the first Scream movie.  I was curious how they would turn it into a series.  I'm glad I decided to check it out.

First off, it's a teen show- and I'm nowhere near being a teenager anymore- but I still enjoyed it.  It takes a lot of elements of the movie- the dark comedy, the mystery, satire- and works them into the show.  I will say that I'm a sucker for a mystery.  I'm one of those people who enjoy it even if I do figure it out.  I don't care, most of the fun for me is watching how it's set up even if I'm fairly confident I know what's going on.  And they make it pretty fun here.

Secondly, the acting is decent/sometimes very good.  This show probably won't win any awards outside of an MTV award, but the acting is good enough that it doesn't distract me from the show because I'm thinking about how bad the acting is, which happens at times.

My regular shows are Game of Thrones, Peaky Blinders, Daredevil and BBC's Sherlock.  I'm also anxiously awaiting season 2 of Stranger Things and Jessica Jones. And I loved SOA and the Wire.  And That 70s Show and Inbetweeners for studying.  I'm just trying to let you know what I enjoy  most of the time.  This show is not like any of those, but I still thought it was entertaining.

It surprised me so much that it made me rethink my opinion of MTV shows and I decided to watch that Shannara thing MTV has on Netflix and I think I made it through the first episode because I was frozen with shock because it was so ridiculously bad.  Then about 15 min into the second episode my body regained function and I turned that nonsense off.

So I go back to my original opinion that MTV shows are bad and this is a one off, but a good one.",1482364800,,1888,4.120547945205479
7696321,5,B01D2KF7C0,"Scream the series does what Scream the films do, but on a smaller, tv sized scale: the fears are intimate, the death too close to home. Perfectly MTV - lots of nubile teens acting just a little to adult, and adults just a little too similar to petulant teens - Scream remains at heart less horror and more whodunnit, with plenty of clues and lots of red herrings. The performances that center it - especially the two female friends at its center - keep everything more grounded than they might otherwise be.",1481932800,5,507,4.521739130434782

7696325,3,B01D2KF7C0,"Before you see this, consider one thing -- except for the concept of a slasher killer with a white mask, this has virtually nothing to do with the ""Scream"" movies.

That said, the first season of ""Scream: The TV Series"" is a fairly gripping teen thriller series that is equal parts ""Slasher"" and ""Pretty Little Liars"" -- lots of ugly secrets, increasingly graphic deaths, and plenty of family drama tangled up in old crimes. The identity of the psycho killer is a bit too easy to figure out, and the teen romance drama sometimes overwhelms the story, but there's plenty of death, suspicion and interesting characters.

The town of Lakewood is shocked when the resident cyberbully/mean-girl Nina (Bella Thorne) is brutally murdered. As she tries to deal with her involvement in some of Nina's antics, Emma Duvall (Willa Fitzgerald) begins receiving phone calls from a person who claims to be the killer -- and who declares that everyone in Emma's life is lying to her. And somehow, this is all linked to the death of a deformed boy said to be a killer, Brandon James.

And the twisted game with the killer continues as more and more bodies begin cropping up, and Emma begins questioning who in her life is the killer -- and what their motivation could be. And despite the best efforts of her and her ring of friends, the killer always seems to be one step ahead of them -- and each of his/her actions helps to bring to light more of people's terrible pasts. Can Emma unravel the killer's identity before she and the people closest to her are the final victims?

If you like slasher stories, ""Scream: The TV Series"" is a pretty solid adaptation of the movie formula into TV format -- it's twisty enough to draw its story over many episodes, with plenty of subplots woven in (such as why the mayor was dragging around a dead body). And virtually every episode ends up drawing the characters to some creepy location (old bowling alley, theater, abandoned hospital) with plenty of places for a knife-wielding psycho to chase them down.

But it also takes some sly pokes at the slasher genre (""You root for them, you love them, so when they are brutally murdered, it hurts""), even as it adds some twists on the usual tropes (a teen house party with booze? Whatever could happen?). But the kills aren't dependent on sexual activity, morals or substance abuse, which makes it more shocking and unpredictable when some people die.

Unfortunately, it does have some flaws. For one thing, the identity of the killer becomes fairly obvious about halfway through the season, and almost every successive clue builds on this... so the big twist is more of a ""eh, saw it coming."" Furthermore, the teen romance angle, while sometimes handled well (the adorable geek romance of Noah and Riley, Audrey and Rachel), ends up overwhelming the whole masked-serial-killer story at some points.

Fitzgerald does a fairly decent job playing a fairly decent character, but Emma's complexity is mostly due to what others around her do. She's a completely standard survivor girl. Far more interesting are Bex Taylor-Klaus as the prickly, gothy Audrey, who is just exploring her bisexuality; John Karna as the lovable nerd extraordinaire Noah; Carlson Young as the troubled rich girl Brooke; and Tracy Middendorf as Emma's mother, who is haunted by the horrors of her own teenage years.

The first season of ""Scream: The TV Series"" is a bit too heavy on the teen romance, but it makes a solid, increasingly-gory rollercoaster-ride for fans of slasher killers. And of course, it leaves us with hints of more horrible deaths to come.",1476748800,2,3601,4.815533980582524
7696326,5,B01D2KF7C0,"This is a really great TV show!  It keeps my attention all the time.  I figured out who the killer was early on in season one, but there were enough clues thrown in that I didn't rule out other suspects.  All of the characters are thin and beautiful; totally unlike a real high school.  There are some gruesome parts in the show, but it wouldn't be a horror TV show if it didn't have that.  The only thing I wish is that MTV would have released this on blu-ray as well as DVD.",1475712000,2,476,4.075268817204301
7696327,5,B01D2KF7C0,"Although Mtv is nothing more than schwag tv shows compared to it's hayday during the 80's and 90's.... (ahem... Music tv?... where the hell's the music?) this show is pretty darn good, that, and it was produced by Wes Craven, so duh! lol",1474243200,,237,4.534883720930233
7696328,4,B01D2KF7C0,"In the interest of full disclosure I must say that I am not a big fan of the Scream franchise. I enjoyed Scream and Scream 4, but it just didn't do it for me despite being a big fan of Wes Craven. When I learned of the TV show I wasn't too interested given its put on by MTV, but after attending Texas Frightmare Weekend 2016 and meeting some of the stars from the show I had to give it a watch. While it won't hit as hard as The Walking Dead, Hannibal, American Horror Story, or Bates Motel, Scream: The TV Series is an enjoyable show for slasher fans. Much like the film series, it plays on the usual Scream TV Series, Screamslasher cliches, in meta form, and doesnt shy away from delivering good kills and more blood than I expected.

The story takes place in the fictional town of Lakewood, where a popular high school student, Nina Patterson, is brutally murdered after uploading a video of the schools closeted bicurious student, Audrey, kissing another girl. We follow Emma Duval, a popular yet more humble high school student, and her classmates as they find themselves targeted by Ninas tech-savvy killer  a killer with knowledge of their darkest secrets. As the town falls into panic over the increasing body count, rumors begin to spread of a terrible incident that occurred 20 years prior, where a crippled introvert, Brandon James, was killed by police after murdering several classmates. Is the killer somehow back from the grave to finish what he started? As the classmates team together and strive for the truth, their friendships, relationships, and ties to the community will be tested, and broken. This is especially the case for Emma, who learns that Brandon James has ties to her past.

Sounds juicy, huh? The opening sequence had me sold and was a direct homage to the infamous opener for Scream. Its violent, up to date on pop culture, and it gives us a look at the new Ghostface mask. Wes Craven said they should have left it alone, but I didn't mind the new look. I think they needed to give us something different given they are using different killers than the film series. It definitely pales in comparison to the original mask, but it isn't terrible. As with all TV shows the story is character-driven, and the writers do a good job of selling them. They are each colorful in their own ways, with the thoughtful lead Emma, the source of know-it-all slasher info Noah, the quasi-goth bicurious outcast Audrey, the mysterious and good-looking new guy Kiernan, the bratty daughter of the mayor Brooke, and a few jocks youll enjoy but won't miss if/when they die. The use of characters then expands with the addition of the adults. There is Emmas mom Maggie, who is the source of Emmas ties to Brandon James, the sheriff who is at his wits end trying to figure out who is behind the murders, and then there is Piper Shaw. An out of town investigative journalist / blogger covering the murders, she is the up to date version of Gale Weathers from the film franchise. The character play is good and aside from the horror going on there are some engaging undertones that will keep you glued to the screen. There are characters you will love and there are some you will hate, so this isn't just a cheap rehash of the source material. Of course, you never know you can trust so everyone minus Emma is a suspect, and naturally everyone minus Emma is dying off. The twists and turns abound and will keep you guessing until the bitter end. However, there is a second season out right now so the story isn't over yet.

Scream fans have probably been out of high school for a decade now, like myself, but horror films with a high school setting still grasp my attention. It isn't even the high school element that intrigues me. It is the nostalgic revisiting of being young and in love with horror films, which helped me identify with Noah quite a bit  minus the part where he gets no girls. High school is definitely different now, and the show reflects that. Social networking, smart phones, computer viruses, and events going viral are a big part of the story, with the killer being the most tech-savvy of them all.

You may see some familiar names attached the show. Ti West (The House of the Devil, The Innkeepers) directs an episode, as does Leigh Janiak (Honeymoon). Actress Bex Taylor-Klaus (Audrey), my personal favorite of this series, previously had notable roles in The Killing (Bullet), Arrow (Sin) and The Last Witchhunter. Tracy Middendorf (Maggie Duval) appeared in Wes Cravens New Nightmare, Bobby Campo (Seth Branson) starred in The Final Destination, and Amelia Rose Blaire (Piper Shaw) appeared in True Blood.

My biggest skepticism going into this show was how effective the horror would be, given its an MTV product. As mentioned earlier, the horror was much better than I expected. The execution of the opening sequence was fantastic, and the show managed to keep up the ante. We see live gore and full-frontal kills, although there will be some that occur off-screen as well. I enjoyed the new Ghostface mask and was glad to see the killer executed to the same mannerisms as the killers in the film series. Its not as good as the original, and nothing ever will be, but its enough to sell the horror. The knife used is nearly identical to the infamous blade of the 90s, but we do see the killer employ some crafty methods to dish out some vengeful deaths. The writing and directing execution result in some fair horror that is sure to please fans of the original series. It isn't over the top, but then again neither was the horror in the films. This is a character-driven effort and the jolts, twists, and kills made Season 1 a fun experience.

Overall, Season 1 of Scream: The TV Series is a solid effort that delivers the core of the Scream franchise alongside modern amendments that make this applicable to todays society. If you enjoy slasher films and mystery storylines this then is probably worth your time.",1473465600,,5954,4.653041825095057

I liked the story of the first season however at times a few episodes came across as somewhat boring and drawn out .

The killers voice was also somewhat laughable considering the one who originally did the voice of the killer was way better .

Not to fault the voice of the new killer mind you it's still not bad and this show has nothing to do with the scream franchise this show is in its own little world .

I also found the last episode very anticlimactic and a big letdown I was expecting something much better and different then that .

The killers reveal was also incredibly bad and had incredibly bad acting attached to the reveal as well.

It was much more funny then twisted or surprising .

The twist at the end was intriguing however and I didn't see it coming .

All in all a pretty good show despite more then a few obvious flaws .

7696348,3,B01D2KF7C0,"A long time ago in a theater far far away I attended the premiere of Scream the original movie. They distributed Jiffy Pop Popcorn containers with the scream logo on the outside as I walked away gift that night, and it quickly became my second-favorite movie trilogy.

Scream 4 came out it was a great ride back down memory lane and I liked it as well.

I was skeptical  about the new series and  as a college professor I feel that I can give it a B letter grade. It's a fun show and takes time to develop like the lines in episode 1 on veiled; where you need to grow and care about the characters. it's true. But what the show really lacks is the scream Villain. The new villain looks like a cross between the fisherman from I Know What You Did Last Summer and those singing Christmas ornaments worth their mouths in the shape of an 'O'.

In Homage  to the movie series they should have kept the costume. It would have been a more fun ride. without doing that, they have stolen the premise and have no ties whatsoever to the original 4 films. And they quickly need a Dewey character to lighten the mood once in awhile. The film buff can't do it all.

 I still feel they made a mistake in not using the Ghostface costume but it's not a bad series overall.  It would be nice to see more ties to the original.",1465084800,3,1307,4.196
7696349,5,B01D2KF7C0,Scream was a surprise hit for me.  The teen drama is a little much but it is one of the most entertaining shows in recent years for me.  I had multiple theories as the show went on as who the killer was.  I ended up being right but still was not disappointed,1465084800,,258,3.923076923076923
7696350,1,B01D2KF7C0,"Took several attempts to make it through the whole season. It wasn't scary & was, may be, at best a B-movie level outing (giving it too much credit). When it wasn't being pretentious, it was plodding. It did roll out just about every trope in the SJW & PC book & when it tried to be scary, it was very ham handed. The series ""Slasher"" was better written (if if the acting was the same) and Scream Queens was way better.  If you wish to waste some time & need something to put you to sleep, then this is the series for you.",1464998400,3,522,4.067961165048544

7696352,1,B01D2KF7C0,"No offense intended to the fans of this show, but how good can it be?  The studio VERY CLEARLY doesn't think much of its potential or it's fanbase, when they don't even release it on Blu-ray.  After all, high definition has been the new television Standard for an entire decade now.  Even 60 year old series are available on Blu-ray.  So for something that was created in and for high def, it's pretty inexcusable, if not downright insulting to the collector market to release it in mere 480i with the types of extremely over-compressed encodes the DVD format is limited to.  Sorry, but if the producers think so little of their property to ""only"" release the series on a 20 year old format based off 30-50 year old tech, the show must be destined for cancellation.  Either that, or the studio really, REALLY has lost touch with the times.  So, again, how good can it be?",1464739200,,871,4.544871794871795
7696353,5,B01D2KF7C0,"I've always really liked the Scream movies and was open minded and interested when I heard they were making it into a tv series. I really enjoyed this series. It's addicting and hard to stop binge-watching. These 10 episodes just fly by. This series doesn't have Sydney, Gale, Dewey, or Randy. Instead, we have a whole new set of characters. Emma Duval is our main girl. Noah is the obsessed horror movie nerd that's similar to Randy. Audrey is Noah's BFF and is our lesbian/bi-curious character.(She's actually one of my favorite characters. I like her attitude and she becomes important as the series progresses) Brooke is the popular girl who means well, but has an affair with one of her teachers.

After a viral video of Audrey and her lover kissing goes around school, a killer with a sorta kinda Ghostface mask begins stalking and killing teenagers. The killer taunts Emma the most and wants her to know why they are killing. Emma and her friends learn about Brandon James, the town's killer from 20 years prior. Is Brandon back with a vengeance, or is someone trying to copycat him? If you love the movies, I would highly recommend SCREAM: THE TV SERIES SEASON ONE!!!",1464652800,,1175,4.7317073170731705
7696354,5,B01D2KF7C0,It is great for one the location and the people in the series are different but it starts out almost the same and the ghost mask but I really liked when the town doctor has A secret that may link the killings and the killer.,1464393600,,224,4.0

7696356,4,B01D2KF7C0,"I thought this was going to be another one of those teenie bopper shows, and it is, but it's got something a little different. I don't want to say anything more than to watch this show! It is a lot of fun and will keep you guessing till the very end when you find out the killer is the reporter Piper Shaw who turns out to be Emma's half sister! Enjoy!",1463788800,,352,3.971830985915493
7696357,5,B01D2KF7C0,This show is amazing. I grew up with the original film and was absolutely terrified. Until this day I'm a huge fan of filns 1-4. I wasn't sure at first if it was worth the watch I'm not going to lie I was pretty nervous to watch the first episode. After watching the whole season on MTV it's one of my favorite shows. The show is amazing and really did creep me out. Their doing a fantastic job with all storylines. I'd say your missing out if you haven't given this show a chance. I can't wait for season 2!,1463270400,,508,4.09

8754738,2,B01D2KF7C0,"I actually watched all 2  seasons but it was a ponderous event at best.
Teenagers acting and looking like twenty somethings and not high school students, a killer that would rather entertain then slaughter his way to his/her goals effeciently, and more ""twists"" then you can shake a stick at and enough Dawson's Creek moments one tends to wonder how can anybody confuse this with actual horror.
This is about as much ""Horror"" as Happy Death Day and I'll bet you the kitchen sink that most people who love that will simply eat this up.
Imagine, 90210 meets Scream.
What I was looking for was the Scream part without the 90210.",1533600000,,625,4.63063063063063

8754743,4,B01D2KF7C0,Its different from the movies. If you accept that before you watch it I think you'll like it. It was a start up season and I started to really like the characters near the end. Can't wait to see season 2 wish they put it out on DVD. Good soundtrack too,1507420800,,252,3.9607843137254903

When this first aired I watched expecting to hate it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I really like this show.  Season two is also very good!  I'll buy that one for my collection next.  The acting isn't horrible and the plot really isn't bad.  It kept me wanting to watch after each episode~,1498608000,2,462,4.218390804597701

8754746,5,B01D2KF7C0,"Creating its own town, legend, and characters, this show pays homage to horror while developing its own place in the genre.  It is well paced, witty, and fully aware of what it is doing.  Its metacommentary is completely out in the open.  The writers make it clear that the slasher story depends on a real world with people you learn to care about, and that the death toll isn't as important as the daily struggles.  For a television show to work, there has to be more to it (so if you're looking for a gorefest or connections to the Scream films, don't bother).  Luckily, the Scream series pulls this off very well, with plenty of secrets, backstabbing, and suspicions.  The first season is solid and a lot of fun.",1484784000,,715,4.503875968992248
