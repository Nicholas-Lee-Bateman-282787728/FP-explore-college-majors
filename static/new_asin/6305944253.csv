1101916,4,6305944253,I remember this movie from when I was a kid.  I haven't seen the new widescreen release yet but I did just order it.  What I'm wondering is why the price is so high here?  I managed to search for it on Google and find a well known site where a new copy was available for under $20 (after tax and shipping).,1182384000,,306,3.903225806451613
1101917,5,6305944253,"""Dinosaurus"" is one of the great, cheap kiddy-matinee movies that were plentiful in the 1950's.  It featured action scenes no 50's kid could resist:  a face-off between a T-Rex and a power shovel, the T-Rex destroying a bus... It must have made enough of an impact on Steven Spielberg that he paid homage to this film (along with several other oldies) in his ""Jurassic Park"" movies.

As noted in the other reviews on this page, the print of ""Dinosaurus"" on this dvd is outstanding.  Here are some other reasons to watch this film:

First, it's hilarious.  Second, it's entertaining.  Third, it's hilarious.  It's populated with the kind of cardboard heroes and villains that were typical of 50's television.  ""Senor Bart"" is the main man here. He's a developer on an anonymous Caribbean island, and he's going to build a harbor which will bring tourists and trade to its poor inhabitants.  Among his crew is a heavy equipment operator named ""Dumpy"", who shambles around like a typical western sidekick.

""Senor Bart's"" girlfriend is Betty, who arrives on the scene in a motorboat in the beginning of the movie, in order to do some reef-diving--(shades of James Bond).  Bart's crew has set some underwater explosions, and Betty blunders into a frozen T-Rex.  Thereby begins the tale.

The equipment operators pull the T-Rex and a Brontosaurus ashore. Unbeknownst to them, a frozen caveman has also been blasted to the surface and drifted to another part of the beach.

Later that night, another colorful character--an Irish drunk--is watching the beachfront digs when a storm arises and a bolt of lightning strikes both dinosaurs.

Freudians would have a picnic with this scene, and indeed with the whole movie.  Try not to chuckle at the sight of two frozen dinosaurs on the beach, stretched out like Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in ""From Here to Eternity"", their mouths agape and steaming in seeming bliss.

Many more ""nudge and wink"" scenes follow.  The caveman has been awakened along with the dinosaurs, and he is shown in several slapstick scenes when he acquaints himself with 50's civilization by invading a beach house.  Chiefly, the caveman is there to become the pal of Julio, the lovable 50's brat who is the movie's tie-in to its main audience.

The caveman winds up sacrificing himself in true noble-savage style, but not before he cross-dresses, throws a pie in the bad guy's face, rides the Brontosaurus like ""Alley Oop"" with Julio, and tries to put the make on lovely Betty.

Julio loves the Brontosaurus, who is remarkably docile and is fated to be meat for the T-Rex, when the inevitable battle occurs.  But after being subdued by the T-Rex, the Bronto manages to thwart the carnivore's desires by limping off to expire in a bed of quicksand.  More meat for Freudians.

After further terrorizing the natives, and getting a Molotov cocktail thrown into his mouth (the T-Rex seems to like that..he tosses his head back and seems to go ""hotcha-cha-cha!""), the big nasty carnivore is dispatched by hero Bart's quick use of the power shovel.  Bart swats the dinosaur over a cliff, and saunters away from the wreckage with a distinctly John Wayne-like gait.

""Projects Unlimited"" did the stop-motion animation for this little winner, and as animation goes, it manages to be effective in a cute kind of way.  The dinosaurs are hardly terrifying, so the sound-effects team provided the T-Rex with an over-the-top roar that includes several animal noises--lions, bears, wildcats (oh my!)  ""Projects Unlimited"" went on to work on the TV show ""The Outer Limits"", and sure enough the patented roar (as well as one of the puppet T-Rex heads) showed up on one of that sci-fi serie's episodes.

Watch this movie for the sheer fun of it, and if you're old enough, reminisce with it.  What other movie can give you walkie-talkies, characters named ""Dumpy"" and ""Mousie"", foot-stomping dinosaurs and Hispanic maids who know how to make Molotov cocktails because there was a revolution where they used to live.

Everybody who made this movie seemed to have fun with it.  You should, too.",1172620800,12,4088,4.9298245614035086
1101918,4,6305944253,"Who'd have thought ""Dinosaurus!"" would ever be restored in widescreen on DVD? Who'd have believed the print would be this ravishing? Stanley Cortez, the brilliant cinematographer who filmed ""Citizen Kane"" may have been slumming here, but his images are splendid, the color is rich and saturated, and the action wild! Most fans know the story, but for the uninitiated: two dinosaurs and a caveman (played by the disturbingly convincing Greg Martell) are unearthed on a tropical island, and revived by a lightning storm. The inhabitants of the island, a stumblebum but appealing crew of semi-recognizable faces, must fend for themselves over the next several hours until the supply boat gets in. Nice stop motion animation by Tim Barr, Wah Chang, and Marcel Delgado (of ""King Kong"" fame) and a great score by underrated Ronald Stein make this a must-have for completists. The perfect movie for ten-year old boys and girls, it's a fan favorite, and has been for years. Bless you, Image entertainment, for delivering such a grand print of this neglected gem. Nice widescreen transfer from Cinemascope elements, some pleasant extras (photo gallery, trailer, etc.) round out this attractive package. ""Dinosaurus!"" fans, buy this. Where, where are Greg Martell, Alan Roberts, Kristina Hanson, and the rest of the gang? This movie screams for an actor's commentary.",1168560000,16,1357,5.258064516129032
1101919,3,6305944253,"During a movie-buying frenzy, one of the films I wound up with was the classic dinosaur film from 1960 Dinosaurus!
Dinosaurus is set on a small island where engineers are busy blasting the seabed to improve access to the harbor.  The blasting unearths a pocket of ice wherein are two frozen dinosaurs, a tyrannosaurus and a brontosaurus.  The local boss quickly sees how money can be made from these bodies.  He also discovers a frozen Neanderthal.  Well, the bodies thaw and revive.  Now there are two dinosaurs and a caveman roaming the island.
The island's population are really quite good at handling the threat the monsters impose.  The locals all flock to an old fortress where they dig a trench and fill it with oil.  The Neanderthal, a woman, a young boy and the island boss all cause interesting plot twists and complications until the film's finale between the people in the fortress and the tyrannosaurus.
This is one of the better dinosaur movies that were popular for so long.  It makes the typical Hollywood mistake of mixing dinosaurs with cavemen (although there is a way to explain that one away in this film).  Stop motion is used to animate the beasts while the Neanderthal is brilliantly executed in live action.  It is almost worth watching the film for the Neanderthal alone as his scenes are very well done (especially his reaction to a modern bathroom).  The rest of the acting is quite good and the story has the characters reacting in believable ways.  Definitely a fun film even in today's age of digital dinosaurs.",1089676800,6,1542,4.777358490566038
1101920,5,6305944253,"Hey, I know it's no Jurassic Park, but it was 1960, what do you expect? This movie has a LOT to offer, pretty cool dinosaurs by that day's standard (at least they aren't lizards or crocs with fins glued on them!), and it also has another important element: comedy. The Caveman is simply there for comic relief, and he fills those shoes (or should I say furry little slippers) nicely. And don't forget all the typecast characters: the beautiful blonde femme fetale, the handsome dark haired hero, his forgetable dark haired buddy, the little goofy kid, the fat man, the drunk Irish guy (dinofood...), and don't forget the evil guy and his two stupid flunkies. Drop them on a Carribean Isle with a bunch of ""natives""/extras and a pair of dinos and a caveman, stir, and serve. Get the picture? But hey, it works. I saw this on TV as a child, stayed up all night to watch it on Horror Incorporated (the Twin Cities Saturday nite midnight movie show), and the DVD version blows the TV versions away. For a 1960 movie, the picture is great, and the sound isn't too bad. Plus it's enhanced for widescreen TVs! What else do you want? It has a trailer and stills too! GET THIS MOVIE!

I have to say that it holds up pretty well even when viewed as an adult. The pacing is good, the characters are fun and even the acting is adequate. And the dinosaurs are not stupid looking like you see on some old movies.

1101984,3,6305944253,"Set on a Caribbean island, Dinosaurus! (1960) is a goofy but mostly entertaining adventure, that has some pretty decent special effects and stop action animation.  Directed by Irvin Yeaworth (The Blob) the movie is not particularly well written, goes for cheap laughs, is loaded with stereotypes, and features mostly passable acting, but is still of interest, primarily for its nostalgia value and prehistoric stars.

Construction workers find a pair of dinosaurs at the bottom of the ocean, and haul them ashore.  The Tyrannosaurus Rex and Brontosaurus appear to be dead, but are very well preserved.  The creatures are left on the beach, and miraculously come alive after being struck by lightning, and begin to terrorize the inhabitants.  A third visitor from the past, a Neanderthal caveman (played by Gregg Martell), washes ashore and somehow comes to life as well.

While obviously dated, except for some rear projection shots, the stop action scenes featuring the dinosaurs are nicely done.  The T-Rex and Brontosaurus engage in a spirited battle, that includes flowing blood.  The special effects high point of the film might be a brief battle between the T-Rex and an excavator, a construction vehicle driven by Bart Thompson (Ward Ramsey) the leader of the construction crew.

Much of the comedy involves the muscular caveman, who does things like try on women's clothing, and also gets into some misadventures with a young boy named Julio (Alan Roberts).  The caveman also has an interesting encounter with Thompson's girlfriend Betty (Kristina Hanson), who even sings to the Neanderthal.  Still, when the situation becomes critical, the caveman proves to be quite heroic.

If you have a taste for older B-movie fare, you will probably find Dinosaurus! an entertaining and a fun watch.  It's rather expensive on DVD, but Amazon's video on demand is a less costly option.  Colors are vibrant, but don't expect much in the way of sharpness.",1326326400,4,1949,5.165605095541402
1101985,3,6305944253,"A construction crew on a Spanish island discover the corpses of a tyrannosaurus, a brontosaurus and a Neanderthal man while on a bombing spree. Lightning during a thunder storm inexplicably brings the creatures back to life, and chaos ensues.

""Dinosaurus"" suffers from a lot of goofiness generally associated with these types of flicks. We have an annoying kid character who never shuts up and somehow isn't terrified of a brontosaurus a few feet from him (yeah I know kids love dinosaurs, as do I, but show some common sense). We are forced to exposed to LAME cardboard-cutout protagonists, including a woman who only use is cooking for the caveman (oh yeah), and the main ""hero"" decides suddenly to save everyone less important than him from the t-rex during the finale. You know the bad guy is bad because not only because he has a an accent, but because he also has, *GASP*, a beard! But the biggest offender of all is when the caveman investigates a (then) modern house. Corny, lamer-than-lame shtick ensues, and this comedy routine gets beaten to the ground. While there are one or two amusing moments (one involving a toilet), it actually ends, I swear to God, with a pie in the face. But as I said before, much of this goofiness is to be expected from this kind of movie from this period, so I guess it's mostly forgivable.

On the upside, there's a good atmosphere. The scenes of the dinosaurs waking up and a few of their subsequent attacks are a bit spooky. Like 90% of the movie takes place at night, allowing for a somewhat chilling feel. The dinosaurs themselves, though designed a little oddly, are obviously the biggest treat here. Classic stop-motion is always a treat, and that's no exception here with the two beasts brought to clawing, gnashing life by a team of FX veterans including Wah Chang and Gene Warren.

Overall, it's okay. The dinosaur FX, moody atmosphere and overall nostalgic value are quite appealing, but the movie suffers quite a bit from the maddeningly-bad and lame cliches of those days, some of which are forgivable, while others make the movie a bit difficult to enjoy at times. Good stuff for classic sci-fi and dino-movie fans, but beware of certain cheesiness and lameness.",1309132800,,2218,4.785900783289817
1101986,5,6305944253,"This movie seems to focus on the two dinos, Julio, and the caveman and star the hero and his lady friend, but what made this movie really special was none of the above.  It was storm and the villain.  First the villain.  Hacker was the actor in this film.  He nails his role.  He is by far the most interesting character (bar the caveman).  When he stomps on Julio's plastic dinosaur toy to punish the boy we are more shocked than when the T-Rex eats someone.  He mocks his henchmen.  He even shoots at one of his henchman when the latter flees in terror. The reason we despise his character so much is that the actor delivered such a great performance. I like his demise under the rubble.  His character was so foul the T-Rex would not have wanted to eat him.  The second star of the film was the storm.  The storm sets the crucial mood which the movie revolves around.  Not only does it isolate the islanders and pit them against the dinos with nothing more than a pistol and a relic canon, it pits them against mother nature.  The island population is forced to make a stand with no help from civilization.  They only have their bulldozers and steam shovels and ruined fortress.  When the wind starts picking up, the fun really begins. Yes, the storms ends too soon but the eerie mood it created continues until the final battle.  I wished it would have lasted through the final battle scene.  Hacker and the storm are the reasons why I will re-watch this film again and again.",1278374400,2,1480,4.4222222222222225

The acting is great including the performance by Kristina Hansen, who, unfortunately for the viewing public, has made only two movies in her entire career. These are ""Dinosaurus"" in 1960, and ""Over the Edge"" in 1979.  It is too bad because she is a superb actor.

The timeline is a bit weird.  The movie trailer states that, the dinosaurs were quick frozen 70 million years ago, while the chapters in the movie believe that these Jurassic animals were frozen 1 million years ago.  This includes a Neanderthal warrior who was frozen along side the dinosaurs.

Even with its time line inconsistencies, this is a fun movie for all.  The audience lives through the struggle of modern people as they are forced to deal with animals that disappeared 70 or 1 million years ago.",1260316800,,926,4.638036809815951

1102049,5,6305944253,"THE STORY: The island fathers of an unspecified tropical paradise are intent on turning their little slice of heaven into a stopping point for cruise ships, in order to bolster the struggling economy. To this end they've hired a team of engineers to enlarge the harbor so big luxury liners can dock there. As our film opens an underwater explosives package accidentally releases a perfectly preserved Brontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, chemically quick-frozen in a subterranean cavern at the bottom of the harbor. The dinosaurs are dredged up onto the beach with a large crane and left there until someone on the mainland can advise the engineers with further instructions. Unbeknownst to the work crew, encrusted in the muck & weeds wrapped around the big Bronto is an honest-to-goodness caveman. A fierce electrical storm later that evening reactivates the spark of life in the trio of time-trapped terrors, and before you know it they're running amok and causing all manner of trouble. There are barrel-chested he-men to cheer for, lovely ladies in distress to ogle, evil villains to boo & hiss at, and the requisite adorably cute orphaned island boy, who naturally ends up joining the brutish but good-hearted caveman and the walnut-brained Brontosaurus for a few light-hearted misadventures. But watch out guys! That nasty T-Rex is still out there... stalking the shadowy jungle depths, tirelessly hunting for its next blood-soaked meal!

THOUGHTS: This film has long been a cherished childhood favorite of mine. Just put your brain in park and enjoy the old school fun & adventure! Children and those still in touch with their inner child should love this movie. It's a wonderfully innocent adventure film with some fine comedy moments and the plot is silly nonsense in the finest classic monster movie tradition. The scenes with the caveman may seem corny and heavy-handed to some but they always make me chuckle and put a smile on my face. Greg Martell's performance as the thick-headed but ultimately lovable Neanderthal lug is pure genius if you ask me. This film is a favorite to screen when there's nothing else on and/or the weather outside is crappy. Highlight of the movie are the somewhat rough looking yet still entertaining stop-motion dinosaur sequences from Wah Chang and the Projects Unlimited boys. (The same company responsible for the similarly-styled dino footage in the original 1970's LAND OF THE LOST television series.)

THE DVD: Quite frankly DINOSAURUS! looks nothing short of incredible on this DVD. According to the liner notes, the film was remastered from original camera elements - and it shows. If you didn't know better you'd swear it was shot yesterday and made to resemble a 1950's monster movie. The picture is crystal clear, with the film's lush color scheme faitfully represented. Blacks are nice & inky and the pixelation & artifacting are practically nonexistant. The soundmix is clean, level and strong. Unfortunately, the DVD for DINOSAURUS! is now tragically OOP (out of print), so hurry and pick up a copy while you still can... IF you can afford the outrageous asking price. DINOSAURUS! desperately needs to be licensed by Shout! Factory, Kino-Lorber or Olive films and remastered onto hi-def Blu-ray.

This movie has it all:  Moderate stop-motion animation that is supplemented with hand puppets? CHECK!  Hunky White Leading man? CHECK!  Pretty but plucky white female lead?  CHECK?  Annoying child actor? CHECK!  Overweight-yet-jolly Comedy Relief? CHECK!  Conniving and Slimy Foreign (though actually local) Ne'er-do-well Villain (who's accent shifts between Mexican, French-Canadian and Cuban and is none of those nationalities)? CHECK!!  Improper ethnic stereotypes (including Inebriated Irishman, Helpful Hispanic Laborer and the Lazy Black Islander?) CHECK!!  Dinosaur and Steam Shovel Smack-down?  CHECK!!

This is a marvelously cheesy 1960's monster flick. The dinosaurs are not too bad, considering the limited budget for the flick.

This was a favorite from my childhood (it came out the same year I did).  When we watched it on the late Friday Night scary movie segment in San Antonio that was called ""Project TERROR!""  I was 24 when I discovered that this movie is on COLOR, as we always saw it on our black a(and white TV's.  (You kids get off my lawn!)

(TRIVIA - Some of the Tyrannosaurus footage was often used in ""Its About Time,"" (A sitcom by the producers of Gilligan's Island) and ""Gilligan's Island"" too!)",1515024000,2,1430,5.303571428571429
7898638,4,6305944253,"I recently saw a Youtube about the viewers' mistakes about dinosaurs because of movies.  The know-it-all commentator took a clip from Jurassic Park and sneered at us that since dinosaurs were related to birds a tyrannosaur would not roar.

Well, I'm old enough to remember the ""elephant jokes"" era and one riddle was:

""What sound does a 500 lb canary make?""  There were 2 answers:

1) ""Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.""
2)  ""CHEEEEP.""

I read an article in the newspaper back then. At the time of this film evidence was building that the dinosaurs were more closely related to birds than reptiles like lizards.  The special effects sound crew reasoned that like the joke they should think of what sound a 36 ton canary would make.  They mixed a number of sounds but  the base sound was a recording of canary song slowed 500 times.

If you see this film you'll notice that it is the origin of the tyrannosaur sound in Jurassic Park.

James Cameron educated himself by studying old films.  I feel that the battle between the Queen Alien and Ridley in the loader exoskeleton is inspired by the tyrannosaur vs steam shovel.",1512000000,,1114,4.680412371134021

After many, many years, it was a joy to see this one again!  Special effects aren't like they are today but it's nice to see the old movies.  In many ways, they're better than the new ones.",1401840000,,360,3.9444444444444446

7898644,5,6305944253,"Great, silly dinosaurs on the loose in the modern era flick.  A frozen T-Rex and a Brontosaur get thawed out on a Caribbean island with few options to fight them.  Also thawed out is a Cro-Magnon.  They are not from the same era so how did that happen!  Along for the ride are a couple of hero types, a couple of damsels, an oily, seedy villain with a Panama hat, his henchmen, and an annoying kid that makes buddies with the Bronto and the caveguy.  The dino effects are lousy at best, which adds to the charm.  Fun stuff.  Highly recommended for fans of bad, earnest movies.  I Love It.",1392508800,,588,4.281818181818182
7898645,5,6305944253,This movie is about two dinosaurs (a Brontosaurus and an T-Rex that are found in suspended animation by a construction crew on a beautiful tropical island. A cave men is also found by a bad guy (the island manager). I thunder storm electrifies the air and brings these prehistoric buddies to life. The storm created a blackout and isolates the island from outside help.  A young boy befriends the caveman and gets a ride on Dino. The T-Rex is hungry and starts eating anyone in sight. The two dinosaurs then duke it out and the caveman saves the day. The T-Rex then does battle against The Man in an all out battle for survival at an old Spanish fort.. Who will prevail? Good movie for the family. Dinosaur violence but nothing gross. Great sound and visual quakity. Very nostalgic. Good stop animation. Acting is good. A little romance here and there. The Caveman should have been nominated for an Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Caveman.,1391299200,4,946,4.698795180722891
