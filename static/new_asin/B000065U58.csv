1708758,5,B000065U58,You can't go wrong with a movie starring Kathy Bates. The story was one that held your attention and told an excellent story about a disabled girl and her career oriented sister. This is a great Sunday afternoon on a wintery day type of movie.,1389830400,,243,4.4222222222222225
1708759,5,B000065U58,"Excellent story.  Well done.  Hallmark Hall of Fame does
high quality shows.  This one is no exception.  I just had to have it!",1367452800,,127,4.391304347826087
1708760,3,B000065U58,"One sister is mentally ill: she is diagnosed as bipolar.  The film's portrayl of bipolar disorder is not very accurate in that it is pretty sugar-coated.  However, the support of her well-off business woman sister is quite nice.  It's a Hallmark film, so it follows that it is simple and sweet.  Kathy Bates does a good job.",1361145600,2,324,4.631578947368421
1708761,5,B000065U58,"I saw the movie version of the book. The story is about a woman who has a sister who is schizo-affective. Someone who is schizo-affective is not just bipolar. They are both bipolar and schizophrenic. Not only do they become manic and depressed like those who are bipolar; they also hear voices, are paranoid, and suffer from delusions like those who are schizophrenic.

Like the author, I have a sister who is older than me who is schizo-affective (in addition to other family members who have some form of mental issues). I understand the author's feelings. I escaped to try to live as normal life as possible, became an over-achiever to prove that I was ""normal,"" and lived in fear that others would see that I wasn't. There is a genetic component to both the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The movie didn't touch on this. I don't know whether or not the book did.",1329868800,,871,4.6558441558441555
1708801,5,B000065U58,"I AM SORRY BUT , I DON'T HAVE A TIME POR SEE THESE MOVIE,

1708802,5,B000065U58,The movie was in excellent shape and came in time [2 days] to show to my group.  It was sbout a mentally ill sister and how she was treated by family members and society.  We need to erase stigma against mental illness--these people have a hard enough time already.,1313193600,,265,4.387755102040816
1708803,5,B000065U58,The movie was very touching. I loved it and I brought the other movie My Sister's Keeper too. Great movie I loved!!! it to as well. I recommend you get both versions you'll love them.,1302825600,,183,4.257142857142857
1708804,5,B000065U58,I was very happy to find this movie on DVD and equally happy to get it as quickly as I did! This seller gave terrific service and I would recommend highly!,1268265600,,155,4.032258064516129
1708805,4,B000065U58,"I enjoyed this movie, as I do most anything Kathy Bates does. The movie is based on a true story of two sisters who are forced to work on their relationship after their mother dies. Kathy Bates plays the bipolar sister who, in the end, seems to have more sense about relationships than her normal, successful sister. It made me think about how the so-called ""normal"" people of the world look at those with mental disorders and other handicaps.",1268006400,,443,4.620253164556962
1708806,5,B000065U58,"Christine, who since childhood has suffered from a debilitating mental illness. Spending most of her life in and out of various institutions, Christine has long yearned for independence, but is unable to wrest free of her controlling mother, Helen. Upon Helen's death, her other daughter, Judy, a successful, self-absorbed art director who has deliberately distanced herself from her family, is appointed trustee of the troubled Christine. The rest of the movie chronicles Judy's frustrated efforts to balance her sister's needs with her own, and Christine's ongoing ambition to stand on her own two feet. This movie does an excellent job of conveying the conflicts that exist among the mentally ill and their families, without beating the viewer over the head with a sentimental sledgehammer, or falling into the all-too-familiar trap of turning mental illness into great melodrama. This movie is very touching and moving. The acting is superb. An excellent movie and a outstanding Hallmark production. This is definitely a must-see movie.",1266105600,10,1040,5.425925925925926
1708807,4,B000065U58,"I received the movie in time, and a nice thank-you note when I got it!",1264032000,,70,3.7333333333333334
1708808,5,B000065U58,"Helpful to see the ""start"" of a mental illness that baffles those around the affected individual. This DVD shows the effect of mental illness on the individual and on the family -- denial, the beginning awareness of a mental health issue, fear, shame, guilt, multiple crises, and eventual problem solving that helps the family heal, even in the absence of a cure.",1258848000,,363,4.870967741935484
1708809,5,B000065U58,You can't go wrong with a Hallmark movie.  They are the best family movies made in my opinion. Amazon is the greatest.,1236470400,,118,4.363636363636363
1708810,5,B000065U58,"A great movie showing how it is to have a ""special needs"" sibling and how it it when you are older adults.",1231459200,,106,3.8636363636363638

7961455,2,B000065U58,"This movie was ok if a bit schmaltzy.  My one complaint is that although generally Kathy Bates was brilliant in this film, I didn't like the bit where she says ""I want us to be sisters forever"" in a little girl type voice. Schizoaffective disorder is scary and debilitating but it doesn't turn you into a toddler! Many schizoaffectives I know are intelligent and real- I think this film patronised them. Also what's with the dreadful pudding bowl haircut and old lady clothes?? Those of us with mental illness diagnosis (myself incuded) dress just like anyone else!",1437782400,,565,4.824742268041237
