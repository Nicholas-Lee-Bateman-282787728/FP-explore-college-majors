2827886,5,B00007JQTD,"Terrific B movie with the presence of a young Samuel L. Jackson set in Liverpool, England. Humor is what saves this movie and a send up of a variety of English accents. Unbelievable situations, you just accept the silly script and have fun. If you want art look elsewhere; if you want fun, you have arrived at your destination.",1509840000,2,327,4.559322033898305

8193063,5,B00007JQTD,"Also known as Formula 51, 51st State delivers. It's action packed, funny, has great locations throughout Liverpool, and a stellar cast who make it work. The plot is pretty good and the pseudo twist at the end is very cool as well. No matter the title I never get tired of watching it.",1515715200,2,284,4.377358490566038

8193065,4,B00007JQTD,"When you see a Jackson film you know what you'll get. This one delivers a side of quirky and along with drug, gang, fem assassin, corrupt police, backstabbing entre. Jackson may be a bit hard to believe as a master chemist who wears a kilt but pulls off his con on the baddies on both sides of the pond with panache. Entertaining.",1514851200,,330,4.338709677419355
8193066,3,B00007JQTD,"This was released in the US as formula 51. This is NOT a B movie with a young Sam jackson. B movies are not released in theaters, and how you get young Sam out of this is beyond me. HE WAS 51 yrs old when this came out, after many of his biggest performances, like pulp fiction, Jurassic park, etc.",1514764800,5,298,3.9833333333333334

8193069,5,B00007JQTD,"Loved how Samuel L Jackson was in it and played a role that suited him very well, add in the off the grid Im a good guy but a bad guy aspect and it really makes me wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before, great movie, and ingenious plot!",1514073600,3,245,3.823529411764706
