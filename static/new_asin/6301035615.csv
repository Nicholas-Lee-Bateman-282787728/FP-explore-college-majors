7809384,5,6301035615,"Kristy McNichol is the treat in this film as David Packers possible love interest. Her role is small, yet a charming performance leaves you wishing she had the main role. This film is now available on a dvd twin set with Love Hurts. A fun, sexy romp and a must for Kristy Mcnichol fans.",1428537600,2,286,4.314814814814815
7809385,1,6301035615,"This fatuous romantic comedy about video dating, an embarrassing postcard from 1988, is riddled with broad L.A. stereotypes. It's plagued by lame acting, inept direction, and an amateurish script filled with inane gags. The movie is notable only for containing Bridget Fonda's first full motion picture role. It includes cameos by the likes of Charles Grodin, Sally Kellerman, and - ugh - Kristy McNichol. Oh, and there's also David Leisure, the actor known for playing a slimy liar called Joe Isuzu in TV commercials as well as McNichol's neighbor on the sitcom ""Empty Nest."" The lead actor is a footnote named David Packer.

Please don't waste your precious time on this lamentable dreck. It's not just forgettable; it's so wretched that you'll wish the amnesia-inducing ""neuralyzers"" from the ""Men in Black"" films were real. However, if you're nostalgic for your youth and would like to relive the late 1980s, there are far better guilty pleasures from that era. I suggest ""The Secret of My Success"" with Michael J. Fox or ""Can't Buy Me Love"" with Patrick Dempsey (both 1987) or comedies by Cameron Crowe (1989's ""Say Anything..."" with John Cusack) or John Hughes (whose 1986 classic ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" with Matthew Broderick is anything but a guilty pleasure).",1412812800,,1272,5.086124401913875

7809387,5,6301035615,"Althought this wasn't a spectacular film, it was funny, and I like funny.  Slow and cheesy at times but it was on the mark with portraying the facades of those who live in L.A. including the fake orgasims.  Bridget Fonda was charming, David Leisure was a convincingly repulsive character, Kristy McNichol gets her freak on, and Charles Grodin's deadpan character was extremely hillarious, for alot of reasons!  The movie had enough gems to make it a positive viewing experience.  You just can't take it serious...",1232323200,2,513,5.0
7809388,5,6301035615,"Actually we used the song in the commercial.  The version in the movie was  much more expensive. I made this movie for $720k, and it's still running on  comedy central.  I've been told it made 10 million.  I had a woman come up  to me and tell me this film changed her life. ""Why?"" I asked.  ""Because I liked the message, 'you can be whoever you want to be  without having to pretend to be some Hollywood phony.'""  So one person  got it.  I'm glad to see it still lives on Amazon.com",954115200,14,483,4.141304347826087
7809389,5,6301035615,"Does every movie have to be some sort of serious war movie or have 100000 special effects in it,NO. This was a good funny movie to watch. Bridget Fonda was also a plus to watch as a young 24 year old.",951177600,10,200,3.902439024390244
7809390,1,6301035615,"I think is was 1988 when I saw YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE at the movies.  As the opening credits rolled and the Phil Collins version, not the Supremes  original, of the song ""You Can't Hurry Love"" played, I should  have known I was in for a dull time.  How could you name the film YOU CAN'T  HURRY LOVE but not use the original hit version of the song?  If you don't  care, I suppose.  Not surprisingly, I remember little else about this bomb  except that it bored me stiff.  What does surprise me: YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE  is available today on video but several quality pictures I remember very  well are not!  Forget YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE, and hurry.",941068800,3,643,4.302521008403361
