8435400,1,B004M20YI0,Totally misrepresented.  Does not include any of the content pictured on the DVD. Very poor video and audio quality.,1520208000,,116,5.105263157894737
8435401,1,B004M20YI0,"This was a collection of old TV shows, not the concert performance that the illustration suggested.  The description should have been more evident if it even existed.  A waste of money.",1391904000,2,185,4.935483870967742
8435402,2,B004M20YI0,"The cover photo was of Victor Borge in his later years.  The entire presentation was of very old TV shows, which included the commercials.  The entertainment value was based entirely on his superb ability to play the piano.",1371600000,3,223,4.842105263157895
8435403,2,B004M20YI0,"It was not so good, consisting solely of footage from a very old Victor Borge TV series.  There are some amusing scenes, but not enough, and the dvd as a whole is too boring to sit through.  If there were some more modern Borge scenes to balance the old TV footage then the dvd would be worth it,  but there's not.",1334275200,5,314,4.114754098360656
