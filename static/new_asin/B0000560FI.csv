7931447,3,B0000560FI,"CLONED is a sanitized TV movie focusing on a young couple who find out that their deceased son was cloned twelve times by a sinister organization.  Of course, no one believes them, but they find their lives in danger as billions of dollars are on the line for the cloning organization.

Elizabeth Perkins (WEEDS, BIG) plays the aggrieved mother with an offhanded sincerity which works for her; Bradley Whitford is her skeptical husband; Alan Rosenberg is the brilliant doctor responsible for the cloning; and Scott Paulin is the cold calculating company bigshot.  It's all pretty tame but the performances and storyline are interesting.",1162684800,,636,5.155339805825243
