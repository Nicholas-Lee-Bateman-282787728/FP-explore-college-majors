3589164,1,B001FU793A,"Haven't seen this movie stoned and don't plan to.  I love the ocean, and the surf culture but this vanity production -- no doubt a blast to make -- is a bore to watch.  And that is really, really sad because all the undisputed screen charisma of Matthew McConaughey, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and Scott Glenn is utterly wasted on this episodic and stultifying vanity production that looks great in it's Blu-ray, hi-def clarity.  But honestly, it's like looking at a turd in sharp focus.  I wish it weren't so.

There is a commentary with the affable McConaughey that, while minimally amusing, does not really answer the not so burning question of exactly why this movie was made or what it's supposed to be about.  My amateur videos of fun times in Malibu, the North Shore and French Polynesia have infinitely more fun and big waves.  I am so disappointed.  I had high (no pun here) hopes for ""Surfer, Dude.""",1230163200,5,913,4.6625

(Normally, I watch a movie or TV show DVD with commentary at a later date-that is, if commentary is a choice.)  He did such a great job at this- telling just enough about the movie but still allowing you to hear some of the actual dialogue.  I feel like I know him several times more than I did before.  While the movie didn't have a whole lot of plot, it is just so much fun to be had.  I've spent a great deal of time watching him and Woody Harrelson in ""True Detective"" this year, so it was interesting seeing how they interacted before that HBO series was probably even thought about.

3589215,3,B001FU793A,"Matthew McConaughey plays Malibu's Steve Addington, a man who defines ""surfer."" The maker of a virtual reality video game wants Steve to become one of the avatars of the game by getting wired up and riding a mock surf board while wearing reality glasses. Steve doesn't want to do this. He wants REAL surfing...and that was pretty much the film.

Steve speaks surfer-ese, a dialect of the Cannabis language group. His language is understood by his manager played by Woody Harrelson, and farmer friend Willie Nelson.

The comedy was light. The drama fake with characters you never really know or care about. The film is about not selling out, but when you have no real values, what is there to sell out?

3589216,2,B001FU793A,I have loved this movie since I first saw it on cable.  I looked forward to the Blu-Ray version.  On my copy the sound is just ok and the video looks terrible...dark and grainy.

3589217,4,B001FU793A,"I found this movie by accident. I was at my local video store thumbing through selections and this one literally stuck out from the rest.  I decided to check it out and subsequently bought it after viewing it and realizing that its exactly what I needed. A good escape.  A good beach movie. I've often felt that to surf is to love the ocean and that's what this is, a movie that's in love with the beach.  Its filmed in such a way that makes one feel like they are at the beach.  I feel like I'm in Malibu with Steve and the boys, like I'm hanging with them.  I feel Steve's dilemma and its a real one.  A dilemma most of us who surf or living true to ourselves are posed with in real life and that is how to make a living without selling out.  So many times in this movie, I thought, ""and this is where he sells out"", and he just didn't do it. The prior post accurately points out the dilemma which steve faces, the one which pits his good against evil.  The temptations of christ.  He being the christ and Willie Nelson being the God.  His friends including Woody from cheers, are the disciples and they are true to form (without being a spoiler here).  That said its worth a look see.  There's a beach make out scene that rivals ""From here to Eternity's"" famous love scene on a secluded beach in Hawaii.  Well this one takes place in Baja Mexico to the loveliest beach music I've heard in a while.  It begins with a kiss and a woman asking Steve, ""What does surfing mean to you?""",1330905600,,1482,4.190812720848056

2/12: Surfer, Dude is an enjoyable light fare of a film that was unfairly panned by critics. I found it to be akin to Easy Rider but not as deep as I hoped. It was a good film to watch regardless. Matthew McConaughey is a very talented actor, and it was a perfect piece for him. I loved the re-teaming of him with Woody Harrelson, bringing back the good ole memories from EdTV. Making it even better is Willie Nelson. It is sort of The Endless Summer for them except there is very little surfing involved. Mostly, it is just a lot of ganja smoking, being stoked, plenty of goat farming, some didgeridoo involved, and rolling in with the times (flashback to Dave Wooderson's scenes). So, that's why it worked for me, and the length of the picture is pretty decent too. All in all, Surfer, Dude is actually a good film because it does have a message about money is the root of all evils and how people want to be independent, away from control and puppeteering. I totally understand what's it like to go to a beach and see flat waves. Either people get the film or they don't. Now, I wonder how bad these shorts smell and also how dirty Steve Addington's feet were.",1328313600,,1185,4.361990950226244

with the video on your digital cam, and it will be more entertaining than this movie. Easy to see why it flopped so bad, and hard to believe it was even released for dvd viewing.

  The one good thing about it, is when you watch the next movie you regard as boring, not entertaining,

There were some good moments such as when security is looking through his items and asks him what he does. He says, ""I'm a surfer"". She asks, ""Is that a job?"" and he has to think about it and says, something like, ""Not really.""
Another interesting part is, he is sitting on the beach and a girl recognises him and asks to video tape talking to him. He, his friends and the girl briefly discuss him doing his thing on a reality show for $$. He declines but for the reason that, he isn't surfing for $$. That's not what it's about. (That was the gist of it) The girl's friend takes interest in his answer and they end up together. Later in the movie, Matt is telling this man how amazing the girl he is with is.

I've watched my fair share of surfing movies, and they run the gamut from corny to nostalgia to documentary, appealing to people casually interested in the sport, to die hard surfing addicts.

3589231,4,B001FU793A,"Dudes, comparisons to Spicoli aside, this is a unique little comedy about the religious philosophy of Wake 'n' Bake Surf Culture. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely brilliant as So Cal surf legend Steve Addington. A modern day stoner Buddha seeking enlightenment thru the meditation of carving waves, riding girls, and sipping doobage. McConaughey walks thru almost the entire film shirtless and barefooted, wearing only a pair of baggies. Even when McConaughey is just walking down the street, he's surfing. He's like a fish out of water, brah. His swaggering swaybacked bowlegged performance is fully righteous. And, totally funny. (Not quite, but almost as good as his role as Wooderson in DAZED AND CONFUSED.) His performance is DEAD ON TUBULAR. (Ladies, you're gonna want his bod.)

Obviously, this film is not for everyone. But, this short comedy is rife with religious and aesthetic symbolism. I was stoked by its heaviosity, brah.

Like an aesthetic Christ, The Addman is a free spirited surfer, baptized in The Ocean, who cares nothing for the material world of money and fame. He seeks only religious adoration and worship of God thru The Living Wave, The Sacramental smoke of The Wisdom Weed, and The Unification of The One Body thru sexual concourse with chicks. Upon returning home after being away from Cali on a surfing sojourn, Addington is tempted by The Devil into a starring role on a TV Reality Show about surfers, ala Big Brother, and a chance to profit from his digital image in a virtual reality game called FREE SURFER. Representing Lucifer, ex-surfer and evil TV producer Eddie Zarno (Jeffrey Nordling) entices The Addman with a totally humongous bag of sheckles. ""We own his image. And his image is reality."" But, Addington is hip to the fact that the illusion is transitory and meaningless. While contemplating a monitor of virtual tropical fish in Zarno's beachhouse studio, The Addman poses this saltwatery Zen koan: ""Something's wrong with these fish, dude."" No way, brah. The Addman refuses to sell his soul to The Devil for material gain. ""I'm not some _ssclown in a greenroom. I'm a surfer, dude.""

For what does it profit a dude to gain the world, and lose his wave?

The Devil metaphorically breaks The Addman's skeg, and there is a sudden drought of waves. ""Something's bogus, dudes."" Totally like Christ, The Addman wanders the desert beaches in prayer, for MORE than 40 days and nights, fasting from the pleasures of The Scented Lotus Blossom and the sustenance of The Good Green, until God's return on The Waves of Everlasting Life Giving Water. It's The Addman's Dark Night of The Soul, man. BRAH?! Why hast thou forsaken, dude?!

Willie Nelson as John The Baptist, who passes his shepherd's rod to The Addman. Will Addington become The Good Shepherd of The Goats? Yay, though I surf through the barrel of the shadow of death I will fear no shark infested waters, for thy rod and thy board they confront me, dude.

Who else but Woody Harrelson, as The Apostle Peter and The Addman's dope smoking manager? ""We got financial worries, brah.""

Will the Addman sacrifice himself on The Cross of Virtual Surfboard to save the souls of his brahs? You grommets should ask yourselves only one question: WHAT WOULD THE ADDMAN DO?

A perfect Double Feature alongside Swayze's POINT BREAK. Funny, symbolic, and full of topless chicks and bud. (Bitchin'!) This film is defintely worth the rent for Matthew McConaughey's performance, and for all the stoner surfer aesthetes out there. It's like THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST for surfers, dude. Hodads, landlubbers, and non-philosophers might want to avoid this one.

""Love and waves, that's what we need in these dark days.""

I feel like they were going for a cheesy surf movie, like previous Hollywood surf movies such as North Shore and Blue Crush. The only difference was North Shore and Blue Crush weren't trying to be cheesy.
The only thing that could have made it better for me would be a surf star cameo and some real quality surf footage, not re-used car commercial takes. I think this would reinforce the character development, not insightful stoner talk.

This has a negetive impact on the younger generation of surfers and the surfing community.

(Amazon should receive some sort of payment for this under the radar advertising.)
  This movie was an attack upon my intelligence. If it intended to display just how morally bankrupt the movie industry has become it succeeded. I was insulted by this movie; I am outraged by the complete decay which has occurred within the film industry. Hollywood has become a sewer line pumping brain death into the culture of this country. Why would someone even think to make a movie like this? I cannot believe an excellent actor such as McConaughey would stoop to the level of appearing in or let alone being the star of this garbage can production.

This movie portrays drug use as normal behavior. Did anyone notice the BBQ seen where small toddlers and children are playing among the adults while they are using drugs?  Parents protect your kids. Don't let them watch this garbage. Don't lose them to the drug culture which is destroying the souls, minds, and lives of our children. Protect them from the corrupting influence of Hollywood which is destroying the very fabric of the American family. Do you want your children to become Heath Ledgers or Lindsey Lohans? Do you think the parents of Paris Hilton are proud of their little baby girl?
Between the pornification of our youth and the mainstreaming of ""If it feels good do it"" mentality, Hollywood has once again demonstrated its total commitment to the destruction of good values and morals.",1231891200,3,1977,4.910179640718563

3589247,5,B001FU793A,"You've already heard all the hype surrounding the release of S.R. Bindler's masterwork ""Surfer, Dude"" on DVD. Now, it's even being rumored that Matthew McConaughey (The Wedding Planner, Fool's Gold) may score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of legendary soul surfer Steve Addington. Some critics even speculate an Oscar sweep, including but not limited to, a 'Best Supporting Actor' to Harrelson and 'Best Achievement in Directing' to Bindler.

""Surfer, Dude"" is a film that works on every level, and it draws its energy and wit from the deft hand of filmmaker S.R. Bindler (Hands On a Hard Body) and its ensemble cast. Bindler first shocked the film world in 1998 with his compelling documentary about a small town Nissan dealership in rural Longview, Texas. Despite his only short stint in Hollywood, Bindler was offered the juggernaut script of ""Surfer, Dude"" and rose to the challenge.

This film boasts powerhouse performances by its leads, a thought-provoking premise, breathtaking visuals and elegant cinematography. Bindler draws inspiration from the greats like Robert Altman (The Player), using long takes to encourage his actors to stay in character (I remember a shot lasting nearly 11 seconds!). The film has even earned recognition from French cinematographer Pierre Am (La Haine) for its ethereal capture of Malibu.

""Surfer, Dude"" is a rich, complex character study which succeeds in large part from Matthew McConaughey's brilliant performance. His genuine and sensitive depiction of a marijuana addict is reminiscent of Nicolas Cage's performance as an alcoholic in ""Leaving Las Vegas"". With obvious help from the genius script McConaughey simply sings Cory Van Dyke's dialogue and totally immerses himself in the character. He accurately captures the feel of a surfer in angst and gives his character the depth it deserves. As far as McConaughey's physical appearance in the film, well, if he wasn't acting he'd most likely be an underwear model, so you can imagine why ""Surfer, Dude"" is the perfect Matthew McConaughey vehicle.

The film gets elevated to another level with help from the supporting cast and emotionally demanding story. Jeffrey Nordling (D3: The Mighty Ducks, Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying) gives a gripping performance as Eddie Zarno, a former surfer turned corporate scumbag who tries to blackmail McConaughey's character. The action sizzles, the drama never slacks and the laughs keep rollin' in. This film doesn't end as a neatly wrapped package with a bow either, it leaves you wanting and craving more. If you're a film historian or even just a regular film buff, ""Surfer, Dude"" deserves a spot in your collection.

3589252,1,B001FU793A,"Wow, I really was hoping for so much more.  Is this the same Matthew McConaughey who took on the screenplays Amistad, A Time to Kill, and We Are Marshall?  Now I have to be completely honest.  There are only three movies that I could not make it through the first hour of the film: Dune, Moonstruck, and now this atrocity in movie making - Surfer, Dude.

The first 30-minutes of Surfer, Dude is so bad that I had to actually squint my eyes to see if that helped things become more bearable.  It didn't.  McConaughey's character is offered a whole lot of money to live in a beautiful home, hang out with beautiful women, and surf as part of a reality show competition, and he wants no part of it.  That makes Surfer, Dude one of the most unbelievable and stupid scripts ever written.  A huge cast couldn't even rescue this film from the depths of Ignorance Ocean!

From this day forward, I will look for the names of writers S.R. Bindler and Cory Van Dyke on every movie I rent or buy, and then I will avoid that selection like the plague.  If you are still thinking about buying or watching or renting this movie, just close your eyes and picture naked women, lots of pot smoking, and Willie Nelson hanging out with goats...then rent or buy something else, cause you've already seen Surfer, Dude.
