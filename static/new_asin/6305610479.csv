1052241,2,6305610479,"I was at the epic length concert on June 30, 1999 (not July 30, as mistakenly written on this site), and I had a wonderful time listening to some of the most incredible guitar playing I'd ever heard. I was overjoyed  to hear that a video/DVD of the show would be released, but I was very  disappointed with the actual product.  The concert lasted over three hours,  and Amazon.com notes that the DVD/video is 170 minutes in their review, yet  it is only 108 minutes!  More than an hour of music has been cut out by the  manufacturers, including what I believed to be the highlights of the show.  Gone are Eric Clapton's ""My Father's Eyes"", ""Pilgrim"",  Sheryl Crow's ""Run Baby Run"", ""Leaving Las Vegas"",  ""If It Makes You Happy"", and Bob Dylan's ""Not Dark  Yet"", ""Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat"".  Gone is the showstopping  duet of between Dylan and Clapton of ""Born In Time"", a song Dylan  wrote in 1991 that was covered by Clapton on his most recent album.  Instead, what the producers of this DVD and video have put out are solid  performanes of songs that have already been released on live albums and  videos countless times.  Sure, I enjoy hearing ""Layla"",  ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""Tears In Heaven"",  ""Wonderful Tonight"", and ""Old Love"", but I have them  live on other Clapton live releases, and they sound very much the same; I  would have rathered to have selections that no other live recording is  avaliable of, or even better, the entire concert. DVDs can hold 4-8 hours,  so there's no reason why they couldn't have included everything.  Also, on  the DVD, the producers do not allow the ""angle"" feature to be  used; for those unfamiliar with DVD, this is a feature that allows you to  change the camera angle at which you're viewing the picture.  It's  especially useful in concert videos, because if you want to look at  Clapton's guitar solo when they're showing Steve Gadd's drumming, you can -  if they encode that feature, which they inexplicably chose not to.  What  angles they did choose were poorly selected; it's filled with bad framing  and inappropriate zooms.  It's a shame they didn't, because it was a  fantastic concert.",945907200,190,2145,4.715447154471545

1052246,3,6305610479,"The recent concert at Madison Square Garden literally left me breathless.  EC came on stage at the beginning and literally played for three hours straight.  When his guests came up, he gamely played backup for them, but  unquestionably the best aspect of the concert was his lead work with he and  his band.  I was hoping that the DVD was a recording of the entire concert,  but in fact it is the pared down and less inspiring show that was broadcast  on VH1.

I've listened to a couple tracks over and over just to appreciate some of the nuances  that I just didn't notice the first time. Clapton's ""Tears in  Heaven"" brought tears to our TV room, and ""Wonderful  Tonight"" made us feel like newlyweds again. He's good, and his sound  people are geniuses.
The video quality is good, too, but that's not what  makes me keep this one in the player.
I was amazed to notice that the  ""data meter"" on my Sony S3000 DVD player, which usually sticks  around 3-5mb/s for a typical movie, was never going below 6 or 7, and was  often pegged at 10. Now I understand why a 90-minute DVD is recorded on two  layers.",941673600,2,775,4.363636363636363

""All I Wanna Do"" was...""catchy"" (Indeed, I almost had to hit myself on the head with a hammer to rid myself of  that stupid refrain), but...well, I had to had to ""read the liner notes"" in advance to ensure that she wasn't on the ""Crossroads: 2013"" set.  A much better ""Clapton & Friends"" is that one he did in '86 with Greg Phillinganes & Nathan East (oh yeah, Phil Collins is there too but you can tune him out).  And after seeing/hearing Mary J.

David Sanborn is going to be David Sanborn and is going to ""fit"" anywhere...It seemed strange a bit for Mary J.

1052605,5,6305610479,"My expectations were largely met. I found Eric's playing quite outstanding as was expected. My rating was somewhat better than I wanted it to be initially based largely on Mary J Blige's inset. It changed the bluesy tone and the subtlety of the guitar work somewhat. I love her singing and the work she's done with Bono but maybe this was a little to hip hop for the context.

Old love (youtube) was the clincher for buying the dvd. David Sanborn was absolutely outstanding as well. Cheryl Crow  did fantastically but I have not yet  'found' her.  The rating therefore really speaks about  Eric.
I have rediscovered Eric about two years ago and am amazed at his guitar work- I absolutely adore it no end.",1372723200,,704,4.6
1052606,1,6305610479,"Watched this last night and thought it was a fairly bizarre show.  Glad I borrowed it from the local library, and hadn't bought it.

First the sound quality. This was fine if you want to hear Clapton's guitar and don't really care to hear much from anyone else. A glaring example:  Clapton introduces David Sanborn early in the show, and I looked forward to hearing his excellent R&B alto sax.  But ... nothing.  From the expressions on the faces of the other musicians, the engineers never got his microphone working.  I heard bits and pieces of his playing, but only when he was playing so loudly that the sound was picked up by nearby microphones.  What a waste of talent!

Second, Clapton's musicianship.  The guy is a wonderful blues guitarist with fabulous licks, but ... he's been playing the same stuff now for three decades without noticeable growth and/or desire to stretch his musical palette.  I'm guessing that his reputation for that style has been so incredibly lucrative for him, that he doesn't want (or is egotistical enough to think that he doesn't need) to continue to develop his music.  Basically, you hear one Clapton solo, and you've heard them all.  As I said in the title of this review, if you're a hard-core Clapton fan, you won't mind that.  If you're not, you may get bored.

Third, the musical guests. Sheryl Crow added a nice change, as did Mary Blige's first couple of numbers -- after that, she got predictable and tiresome.  Bob Dylan was simply bizarre.  He looked out of place and, frankly, disoriented during his two short songs -- the second of which was the Clapton vehicle, ""Crossroads.""  Dylan attempts to sing with Clapton on that one, but the two were completely out of sync.  So, it was just weird.

Some may have considered him ""God"" at one time, but his shows have become formulaic, tired and a bit cynical over the years. So, the dyslexic version is probably more accurate today: Clapton is Dog.",1372550400,,1943,4.695266272189349
1052607,5,6305610479,I have watched this DVD very often. It's one of the best Clapton Concerts I've seen. I have a number of Clapton concert DVDs and all are great but this is at the top of them for me.,1359158400,,181,3.789473684210526
1052608,5,6305610479,Excellent video and sound qualities.  I enjoyed everyone of the tracks and every artist who performed in the video especially Bob Dylan.,1358812800,,136,5.181818181818182
1052609,4,6305610479,"Eric Clapton is a phenominal artist to follow career-wise. It has been over my almost ENTIRE 60 years of age; as I was turned on to E.C. when I was 11 years old, in the beginnings of the then Undeniably Wonderdous, and Totally Exceptional Beginnings of the First British Invasion of Artistry that we, over here in the United States, were very privileged to experience back in the early 60's, and we know who really started THAT! But I will not digress!

I've watched him, followed him, since his time with John Mayal and the Bluesbreakers, the Yardies, and of course, his exceptional time in Cream, which, granted, is pretty much beyond compare. I've watched, and watched , and watched, as I matured, and no matter where my musical tastes took me, whatever ""Crossroads"" of musical tastes, and they remain extremely varied, that my love of music took me down, and around, and through, I STILL remained ever faithfull to Eric Clapton. His blues-based tastes, and his interpretations of them, mixed in with his newly acquired own style preferences, ( reggae, Delaney and Bonnie, etc. ) he never tired of exploring everything that he takes a genuine interest in. He has amazing good taste, and his guitar techniques are also incomparable. He isn't just a powerhouse on the electric guitar(s) but he plays uniquely on un-amped equipment as well. I find him aging like the very best of the finest wine, and I find Eric Clapton in constant ""refinement"", and his interpretative skills of almost ANY song, of ANY material, is challenging, and generally nothing short of ambitious, and exceptional in it's delivery. In a few words, he's hard to beat.

Having said all that, it is quite evident on THIS dvd that he still more than has all those capabilities. His solo songs on this dvd are incredible, and most all of his pairings are successful, and great fun to watch, and to listen to. It's a near-perfect concert, I absolutely adored his pairing with Sheryl Crow, he absolutely re-invigorated both himself, and Sheryl, and it was really great watching them play off each other. She in her early successful career, the Master, and the New-comer, very interesting. That being said, unfortunately, there IS a ""fly in the ointment"" in this concert, and all of the pairings don't work, and nothing is worse than his set with Mary K. Blige. They don't mesh well at all, he looks, in an extremely rare occurence, out of his element; and they never can get it together, she sounds off-kilter, too, and almost the entire set. Also, not a big fan of THIS concert's pairing with Bob Dylan, they BOTH have done much better in other pairings with each other, at other concerts. Bob is hard to decipher here, he's more than usually hard to understand in his lyrical performance. Unfortunately, although not as badly as with Mary K. Blige, it also tends to bog Eric down too, and since this pairing comes close to the end of this concert, he needs to resurrect himself somewhat, but E.C. manages to pull it out in his final solo performances.

So, NOT his best, but also far from his worst. I rated it a #4.",1354233600,,3085,4.6987060998151575

This DVD also includes my personal favorite renditions of the songs ""Old Love"" and ""Wonderful Tonight"", which was nice to say the least.

It seems that you can't really find this DVD in stores and even if you could, amazon would still have the better price.

He uses the same arrangement/approach that the Dominos used, and it is good.  After that, I have to agree with the other reviews here that critise the choices of selections from the concert that ended up on the DVD.  I would really enjoy seeing the songs that were deleted, rather than the great, but oft repeated warhorses like ""Sunshine of Your Love"", and yet another ""Tears in Heaven.""  There are just so many wonderful choices in his past repetoire that he NEVER performs now like ""Strange Brew"", ""Forever Man"", or ""I Am Yours"" that would be precious to many of his fans!  But to avoid misunderstanding, I must say that what is here is predominantly great.  (The only blatant exception being the horror of what is done to the usually poignant ""Old Love"" by a keyboardist that I have never seen with him before.  I ""skip"" over that song always!)
  The guests are somewhat unusual, though mostly pleasing.  Sheryl Crow is fine, Bob Dylan is excellent, Dave Sanborn is probably good, (I rarely take note of horns), but the Mary Blige section is, ...well, ...unexpected!.
  Clapton's backing band is mostly the same folks that are usually with him; Andy Fairweather-Low, Steve Gadd, and Nathan East with Katie Kissoon & Tessa Niles.  They are always enjoyable to hear.  (He later dropped the girls from his 2002 tour, and I missed them on ""One More Car""/Rider).  I have read that he sometimes determines his song selections according to the capabilities of his backing group.  If that is so, then I would appreciate a little variety in the players he recruits - time is moving on, and I would love to hear/see him do some of the afformentioned tunes before he hangs up his new, graphic strat forever!",1073001600,36,1876,4.636363636363637

She repulses me because she refuses to take singing lessons. Well, if it makes you happy!!! Edit out Mary and Cheryl and you have a great show. At least Eric had the good sense to include Tessa Niles and Katie Kissoon, unlike the 2001 tour!

The guest artists are excellent. Sheryl Crow and Clapton sound wonderful together, and I was glad to see her there. Mary J. Blige... I don't know, if it suits your fancy... and Bob Dylan was excellent if you like Bob Dylan, as I do. David Sanborn, one of the best rock saxophone players today, is an excellent addition to the house band, which includes standards like Nathan East, Steve Gadd, Andy Fairweather-Low, Tessa Niles, and Katie Kissoon, plus Tim Carmon, a great keyboard player who makes his keyboard solo sound like a guitar solo in ""Old Love"", and Dave Delhomme, who just sits and plays keyboards. Great companion to ""Live in Hyde Park"".",1023840000,14,888,4.591194968553459
1052757,5,6305610479,"Eric  Clapton  puts  on  a  great  performance  during  his  show  taped  live  at  Madison Square  Garden,  New  York  City.  Invited  to  sing  along, Sheryl  Crow, Mary  J.  Blige,  Bob  Dylan,  and  David  Sanborn make  a  great  combination. It  was  among  the  first  DVD's  I  viewed  and  without  question,  is  still  a  favorite.  In  my  opinion,  Eric  and  Sheryl  are  the  perfect  duo;  they  are  very  moving  in  ""Little  Wing"".  The  confindence  they  portray  adds enjoyment  to  watching  this  concert,  while  the  cause (sobriety)  adds  hope.

1052759,5,6305610479,This is a must for anyone who appreciates the very finest in concert viewing and listening. EC pulls out all the stops on this one. He even blows away some of the stars that are playing with him. They can't believe what he is playing. Some exceptional EC riffs and music. Highly recommend.,1004918400,,289,4.471698113207547
1052760,5,6305610479,"In a rare peek into the vast live performance catalog of the guitar virtuoso, the Benefit for Crossroads DVD is a magical gem. I've been tracking Clapton's career since I was seven and see now that maturity and age have sweetened his bouquet and strengthened his potency. He has never played better and his voice has never sounded so strong and emotional.
If you're looking for cheap theatrics or even sophisticated ones, then you don't know Eric Clapton. This man puts on a show, but it is a show of music and musicianship unrivaled by anyone. There is little action and no explosions, but this is a concert, not a Jackie Chan movie. Clapton takes the stage and your attention and your heart on a sonic roller coaster ride - no diverting light show needed.
He performs a few classics with his usual passion as well as setting up a few I've never heard him do live. Hendrix's ""Little Wing"" from his stint as Derek is as powerful as ever. And when Sanborn takes what looks to be an unexpectedly long solo, Clapton and Sheryl Crow beam at him, smiling. A little magic caught on film.
But not the only magic.
""Old Love,"" one of his newer classics and rising in my list of favorite Clapton tunes, has quite a showing here. From dead silence as he plays through a searing emotional blues solo to cheering and applause in the middle of the song, this one demands to be heard.
His guests shine as well, particularly Sheryl Crow crooning ""Difficult Kind,"" a song that has since become a favorite of mine.
Yes, I'm one of Eric Clapton's biggest fans. I nearly killed myself racing 80 mph, dodging tornadoes and T-storms to make it to his concert in Dallas' Reunion Arena in the early '90s. I bought this DVD without compulsion after having seen it on VH1. I'm just glad you cannot wear out a DVD or this one would be paper-thin powder.
If you're a Clapton fan, there is enough magic here to enthrall you for years - too much to mention. If you're not, you will be after watching this. Some magic is just too strong to resist.",992304000,5,2016,4.466124661246613
1052761,3,6305610479,"It's fun to watch the band interact with E.C.; everyone on stage is clearly having a great time. There are some flubs, and a couple of songs drag, but these are minor distractions against a group of gifted musicians enjoying themselves and each other very much. At its best, it's a jam session of terrific musicians.
The guest artists are a decidedly mixed bag. David Sanborn soars on some songs but sounds oddly out of place in others. I don't know if Mary Blige really had a place in the sets, and I'm sure not going to rush out and buy her albums, but it was . . . interesting, anyway. Sheryl Crow was terrific and Bob Dylan actually smiled.
From reviews of the concert itself you have to wonder at the song selection on the DVD, and why some songs got cut. Overall, what you get is not terrific, but is quite solid. This concert is not his best, but even mediocre Clapton is very, very good, and this is a long cut above mediocre.",991612800,2,934,4.3125
1052762,3,6305610479,"Being a long time clapton fan I feel this is not his best live performance.  The production of the concert is ok and sound quality is fair.  There seems to be a lack of energy from the band and clapton.  David Sanborn seems to be out of pocket in the blues setting, although he is a great jass sax player.  Got to give it to Nathan East who always smiles and playes 100%.  Keyboard player was new, did not like the solo in OLD LOVE, guess Im spoiled with Chuck and gregg.  It was nice to hear live versions of his new stuff.  There are some great songs there.

The sound is the best, considering is on a pack Madison Square Garden. I even put it better that the James Taylor and Eagles DTS. Yes, there are some boring songs but especially Dylan , but there are a couple of songs that simply are awesome.",980726400,2,506,4.270833333333333

1052806,2,6305610479,"After Clapton Unplugged expectations were high and the recording of the Live at Madison Square show was unable to capture the energy of the artists and the audience, making much of the DVD dull and boring.  One of the few highlights for me was the appearance of Bob Dylan toward the end of the show.  I am not sure who decided to bring Mary Blige on stage - she has neither class nor talent.  Her act does not fit and takes away from an already borderline production.  Die hard Clapton fans may want to wait for a big sale on this DVD.",971136000,5,535,4.215686274509804

Kinda like the ""headliner"".  My DVD fast  foreward button got so much work with this Clapton show it was smoking.  Once again Clapton is going thru the motions. I am sorry...but can we  shelve ""Tears In Heaven""? Sheryl Crow playing bass on stage with  Eric Clapton?  Give me a break.  Sorry to sound so sophmoric, but I was  extremely disappointed.

1052809,2,6305610479,"I saw this show from sixth row seats at the garden on June 30th, 1999, and there was only one thing that was able to save it. I had sixth row seats. Clapton played some good songs, but flow of he concert was interrupted when  the a special guest was introduced (all of whom - Dylan to a much lesser  extent - weren't worth paying to see). Clapton seemed to be bored with the  songs he was playing, and just wanted to get through the show. When I saw  the VH1 tape of it a few weeks later, I was bored. The DVD plays the same  songs that VH1 did, so a few were cut out. Most notably Badge, the  highlight of the show, and the second song of the encore, in which Bob  Dylan, Sheryl Crow, and the special saxist (whose name escapes me) all got  on stage together - a fitting farewell. I wouldn't pay the money to see  this DVD, as it doesn't do a mediocre concert justice. If you are looking  for a good Clapton tape or DVD, I would suggest looking at titles such as,  24 Nights, or The Cream of Clapton, instead.",950832000,9,1010,4.05050505050505

David Sanborn highlights Little  Wing, an Eric Clapton/Sheryl Crow duet, with some inspired sax.  The rest  of the show was so good that Bob Dylan's introduction for the final set was  almost an anticlimax.

Although I enjoy the later ones more (especially 2007), any collector will be looking to own this 1999 concert, especially to see how the concert series (ahem) improved over the years.  I got this mainly because of the Little Wing performance, and I enjoyed the Dylan and Crow performances.  Seeing the Mary J Blige performance, you get the sense that Crossroads in 1999 was seeking its footing and rhythm, which it definitely found in subsequent years.  The performances are overall enjoyable enough, and give you something to look forward to in the following Crossroads concerts.  Jump in with the entire Crossroads series, and spend a nice weekend with a lot of great music.",1485043200,3,756,5.016
