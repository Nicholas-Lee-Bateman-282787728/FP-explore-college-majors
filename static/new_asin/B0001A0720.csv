8570150,1,B0001A0720,"Boy, was I disappointed!!
The editing just plain sucks, every effect in the book was used, slo-mo, jerky movements, fake colors, and so much of it!
It's not really watchable, my girlfriend left after fifteen minutes, luckily it's a short video so I didn't have to wait much myself.
I'm sorry to say that I feel ripped off but it's the truth.
The other review was positively glowing so I felt compelled to give my take on this video, It's not fun to bash anyone like this but other buyers have a right to know that not everyone that bought this video is satisfied.
The video has a very homemade feel but for all the wrong reasons, they just went nuts editing it. It's gonna look SOOO old in a few years time.",1079568000,,707,4.323308270676692
