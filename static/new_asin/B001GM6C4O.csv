3615817,4,B001GM6C4O,"This film discusses German contingency plans for England should the planned invasion of the islands take place. Mixing actual WWII film footage with ""reenactments"" and interviews with people actually involved with resistance planning at the time and historians it tells a compelling story. It includes information about the Auxillery Unit, an underground organization which was kept quiet for decades. In the event of a German invasion the unit would already be in place and armed with secret hideouts, weapons and radios. It is a pity that this video was not re-edited for DVD release, however, as the logo and music reminding you of the name of the program can get very annoying at times. Will make you want to learn more, though.",1303603200,2,732,5.008196721311475
3615818,1,B001GM6C4O,"Okay, this film must have been designed to be viewed on the television. There are constant interuptions throughout, which I can only imagine was where a commercial would have come in, with annoying exit and re-entry music designed to introduce commercial breaks made consentrating on the minimally interesting material difficult to follow, and impossible to enjoy.

I bought this DVD sight unseen, and was sorely disappointed with it.  I think worst of all was the awful musical score that interjected itself between scenes, or attempts at editing.  I could never sit through this one again - not even if you paid me.",1292371200,6,617,5.029411764705882
3615819,4,B001GM6C4O,"I took another gamble on a $5 bargain bin dvd, and this one turned out pretty well. First I will admit up front that some of the acting and especially the voice-over work is really cheesy. Fortunately I laugh at cheesy, campy stuff, it doesn't offend me, and besides, I've seen much worse.
That being said, the dvd is really interesting. They have their facts right about a lot of things. I was impressed to see that they remembered the Nazi occupation of the British Channel Island near France. I believe that was the only British soil the Nazis controlled. I have researched this before I bought this dvd, so I knew they were correct in that part. They have obviously done considerable research of old German documents, and used this to paint a fairly realistic picture of what life would have been like had Hitler successfully invaded Britain. I also liked the interviewing of the old would-be resistance fighters in Britain. The only thing I wish they had done more of is make it clearer just how disastrous a blow this would have been to the United States. We would have entered the war, and we would have had to invade all of Europe through Italy, or alllll the way across Russia and into Germany from the East. And that's only AFTER we had beaten Japan. Either way, the war would have gone on much longer, and it would have gone nuclear, (more so than it really did) and the United States would not have gone untouched. We would have lost some East Coast cities to long-range German bombing.
So, this movie may not be a masterpiece, but it's decently done and thought-provoking, and you have the acting to snicker at as well. If you can find it for $5 or so, go for it. I don't regret my purchase.",1260835200,6,1704,4.482315112540193
3615820,1,B001GM6C4O,"Obviously, this offering was filmed to be on television.  The constant interuptions (to the film) with exit and re-entry music associated with commercial breaks made consentrating on the minimally interesting material impossible to absorb.

Are the Producers proud of this film?  It is so obviously a last ditch effort to milk a few bucks out of this imaginary documentary.  If I had the power, I would burn all copies of the DVD and call a firing squad for anyone associated with the film.",1253577600,,490,4.867469879518072
3615821,4,B001GM6C4O,"I enjoyed this DVD very much - it was both informative and chilling. The only thing I didn't like was the constant use of the same graphic of the swastika over the U.K. - it got to be very annoying, but overall it was a well produced look into the evil methodical minds of the Third Reich.",1253145600,3,289,4.087719298245614
3615822,4,B001GM6C4O,"rather over dramatic introduction to each chapter. It begins accurately enough, with the first year of World War II. France & all of Europe had been defeated by June 1940 & the English Channel Islands have been occupied. Preparations have already been made for the defeat of England & Operation Sea Lion, the actual invasion in September 1940. Interestingly the German troops occupying The Channel Islands & Paris were well behaved & actually spent their own money on the local economy. This may have lulled many Brits. Then alternative history takes over with a vengence. The German air force badly defeats the RAF, the ability to make more planes & the early warning system of radar stations are destroyed. Having cleared the skies the Germans employee the dreaded blitzgrieg by air & 100,000 land troops. Churchill is killed in his bunker & the royals flee to Canada. The home guard & what is left of the British army retreats from the coastal areas in disarray. Six weeks later the Germans march into London. Now the the Nazis take off the velvet glove. Preparations for the administration of an occupied Britain had been made years before, that reality is made clear in this movie. Most alternative history strains the bonds of credulity & Hitler's Britain is no exception. That is part of the enjoyment. So 2,000,000 men are rounded up & sent to Paris as POW's & hostages so the rest of the population behaves & does not resist. Quite a task to do so quickly. The Nazis even have a little black book with the names of socially prominent people. Masons, Socialist, Liberals, Jews are all identified. Especially immigrant Jews. They were targeted for immediately disposal. In reality the British has already done this little task rounding up all non-native Jews as war approached. The police were co-opted by collaborators in their miidst & appeasers like Lord Halifax were enisted to help. Edward VIII, abdicated as king of England before the war had been identified as sympathetic to the Nazis  & was reinstalled as King. The movie extrapolates on. Britain's atomic secrets from America are obtained by Germany & the rocket science we obtained form German scientist in reality is never realized. The last scene of a Swastika on the mooon is quite disconcerting. The movie is entirely done with newsreel & documentary footage, some you may even recognize. But if you like history or even ""what if"" history you'll enjoy this.",1233964800,18,2429,4.895631067961165
3615823,3,B001GM6C4O,"On the whole, this DVD is acceptable, especially given the bargain price, under $10.00, and 95-minutes of running time.  Nevertheless, I expected more on what the British might have had in store for the Germans had they really attempted an invasion, pursuant to Operation Sea Lion.  That invasion would have launched something like 250,000 men onto the shores of southern England in an effort to take over the country by force in the summer of 1940.  Support from the German navy and air force would have been massive, but precarious, given the strength of the RAF.

It's been rumored that Winston Churchill planned to pull out all the stops to repel any invader by flooding the shoreline with petrol and setting it ablaze.  Then, as the Germans had tried to land, Spitfires, Hurricanes, and Mosquitos would have bombed them with mustard gas.  If this had happened a major conflagration might have resulted.  Then, Hitler would likely have retaliated with poison gas bombs from attacking airplanes and the British would have paid dearly.  RAF Bomber Command would have attacked major cities in Germany the same way and the loss of life would have been staggering.

The DVD mentions next to nothing on this topic. Rather, it shows what would have happened to England and the rest of Great Britain had the Nazis taken over the country as they had in France, Holland, Denmark, Norway, and elsewhere.  The DVD is OK for what it is, but could have offered a lot more.",1229731200,15,1462,4.812

...of what would have happened if the RAF had failed. Both sides had prepared countless plans and contingencies for the invasion of the British isles, and this movie explores the most probable. They also juxtapose the behavior of the German Army in France and the Channel Islands with their actions in eastern Europe.

I don't see this as revisionist history because it is based on verified documents from both sides. Of course there is a certain amount of conjecture when they talk about collaborators. On the other hand, actual interviews with some of the individuals that had been trained to form the resistance was brilliant.

What I absolutely hated was the burning swastika motif they play with annoying frequency. It seems like they play it every minute in the first half of the movie. I won't buy this because of that.",1408492800,,828,4.823943661971831
3615847,4,B001GM6C4O,"The narration was good, but I would rather see a WWII Documentary that examines what would have happened if Hitler was not so stupid to have invaded the Soviet Union. Had Hitler stopped to pause for just 1 year after he took back Austria, then honored the Soviet non-aggression pact, and waited to strike Poland after doubling his forces and Navy, then very good chance he could have walked over Great Britten with ease. Soviets would have stayed out of it. Germany could have won the war by keeping out of Russia and spending one more year building force before carving up Europe. Just 20% more effort with a bit larger Leuftwaffa and Great Britten would have lost all of it's air defense during the battle of Britten. That would have left GB wide open for invasion with only a single front war. Proof Hitler was an idiot.",1405209600,,823,4.5675675675675675
3615848,5,B001GM6C4O,"This two-disc set has a nice blend of re-enactment and modern interviews, period footage and other illustration, like tours of surviving installations. It is based on the two surviving copies of the German plan for what to do when they occupied Britain. It's not pieced out of several partial sources, but works from the official handbook on who to arrest, what groups to suppress, and how to treat the populace to reduce problems.

I hadn't heard of Churchill's special operatives for behind the German lines of occupation. That's on the second disc. It's fascinating to watch the interviews, see the youthful pictures of these old patriots, and realize that these men and women volunteered for sabotage and assassination, even though they knew their lifespan after commencing operations would be measured in mere weeks.

Yes, the commercial break music gets a bit tiresome, but in the first disc it generally precedes a change in date, so it doesn't seem out of place. It's actually much less annoying than, say, CGI of dinosaurs in a Discovery Channel program, where they have a total of three segments they repeat constantly through a 45-min show. This is nowhere near as frequent.

As a WW2 buff with a bent for European espionage and althist, I thought this was great, and very much enjoyed watching it.

You might also enjoy 'The Silent Village,' a 1943 tribute to the Lidice massacre in what is now the Czech Republic. Not being able to get to Bohemia in the middle of the war, the film makers shot it in a Welsh mining village, using all local people, who felt their kinship to the Lidice miners. The idea was to make English audiences feel what this meant to the Czechs, while inadvertently creating a bit of althist cinema of an occupied Britain.",1399161600,2,1757,4.80794701986755
3615849,5,B001GM6C4O,"The documentary uses captured German plans for invasion and pacification of Britain. As one might expect for Germans, the plans were comprehensive, specific, and deadly.

The actual details of the plan are juxtaposed with what the British actually set up to make an invasion a mission impossible for the Germans, so far as possible. Enactments of resistance plans, using actual locations and people in period dress added to the interest and dimension to the telling.

Anyone interested in WWII will find this documentary an interesting, informative work.",1383004800,2,554,5.35632183908046

This Canadian documentary presents what might have happened to Britain had the German air force secured the skies over Britain for an invasion and Nazi occupation of Britain. This is a true horror scenario but one that people should pay attention to. The Nazi record during Occupations clearly indicates no benign governance, and it makes it all the more clear how much we all owe to Churchill for the determined resistance to Hitler and he and the British put up.",1352073600,2,592,4.757281553398058

8306047,4,B001GM6C4O,"This DVD presents the counterfactual of the NAZI conquest of the UK. It is comprised of two parts. the first episode combines two elements. One of these is a description of the NAZI administration  of the UK based on the NAZI's captured planning documents for it. The second element is to trace teh implications of  the defeat of teh UK by the NAZIs. The DVD shows how this could ahve lead to the defeat of the USSR and with that the development of a cold war between the US and a NAZI dominated Europe. The second part of teh DVD describes a planned UK resistance force called the ""Auxiliary Forces"". These were set up in anticipation of the NAZI invasion of the UK and were to operate behind NAZI lines to harass them.

The DVD was both entertaining and full of intellectual content.  I would recommend this VD to anyone with an interest in the history of teh 20th century or WW2 in particular",1485388800,,895,4.439024390243903
