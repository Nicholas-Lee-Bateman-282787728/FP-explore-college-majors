810108,3,6304218036,"Sorry I did not really like this performance.  The VHS of the Kirov performing at home with Asylmuratova and Zaklinsky is much better although the lighting is not as good in places.  (Hopefully this will be available on DVD soon.)

In the performance here, Lezhnina is not at all compelling in the lead.  In fact, as I watched Makhalina dance the Lilac Fairy, I yearned for her to have been dancing the lead.  Although Ruhzmatov is a spectacular dancer somehow he fails to fit the picture of the Prince.",1091750400,8,503,4.606741573033708
810109,5,6304218036,"Having been part of the ballet scene many years ago as dance accompnanist to Makarova and Barysnikov, Lynn Seymore and many others, I offer my humble opinion as, I hope, an antedote to Gary Shen's (in my opinion) misguided review. Whatever shortcomings this production has: yes, the lighting is bad but I suggest you turn up the brightness level on your TV as I do each time I watch this video; yes the choreography is not completely the original Petipa (but neither is the Royal Ballet's version whose modern sets I find completely distracting); and a female Carabose is to my mind definitely not a plus...HOWEVER, this video has probably the greatest Aurora you will ever find on commercial video:Altynai Asylmuratova. This great dancer now heads the famous Vanganova School in St. Petersburg and has retired from dancing (since 2001). It is a pity that so little of her glorious work remains on film for posterity. In many ways she is reminiscent of Galina Ulanova, arguably the greatest dancer of the 20th century, especially in the use of her long arms and in her uncanny ability to continue the movement of one step on into the next. The emotional depth of her dancing is in a class by itself and I urge all dancers to study her work. What a pity no one filmed her farewell Aurora in London in 2000 when the Kirov brought their newly-reconstructed original 1890 version to the west. That version (hopefully on film in the not-too-distant future???) will leave all other productions in the dust.",1085097600,17,1500,4.773076923076923
810110,4,6304218036,"This is Tchaikovsky's ballet performed by the Kirov Ballet on it's Canadian tour in 1989; it contains all the ingredients to make it a spectacular success. It has, for instance,  the creme de la creme of the Kirov principal dancers; Larisa Lezhnina, Farukh Ruzimatov and Yulia Makhalina. Then add to this the beautiful backdrop scenery,  working fountains,  huge chandeliers , sumptuous costumes for all its participants, and you'd have a production of  "" The Sleeping Beauty"" to die for, right....well not quite. Let me explain.

Having watched this DVD performance a couple of times, I have this gut  feeling that when choreographer,  Marius Petipa, saw the original score for this ballet, his initial though must have been, ""my God, what I'm I going to do with these people for over 2+ hours."" Despite all the positives I've mentioned above, I honestly feel that not even all this onstage beauty and talent (not to mention an incredible effort by both Lezhnina and Ruzimatov) could justify this slow paced, sometimes repetitive work. Some of the dances (excluding those of the principals) seem have little to do with the overall story: In fact, the Prologue seemed to be dragged out and some of this area of the ballet  could have been significantly shortened. I must admit that during some segments, I had difficulty keeping my attention focused on this performance.

All in all, a beautifully staged and exquisitely danced production that is superbly recorded (both audio and video) but it is, simply put, too long.

As commenter John Beal noted below, apparently the choreography was done before the musical score. I guess second paragraph sympathies go to Tchaikovsky instead of Petipas.",1059004800,13,1723,5.053003533568905
810111,5,6304218036,"Tchaikovsky's second ballet, presented at a prestigious Russian  theater in the 1880's, became successful and standard for ballet dancers and is still a ballet enjoyed by many in several levels. It is the age-old Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. Aurora is the princess under the curse of a wicked fairy, doomed to sleep forever until a prince awakens her with a kiss. Bits and pieces of the Tchaikovsky score was used in the 50's Dysney animated film, Sleeping Beauty. This DVD is visually striking and the Russian ensemble who perform the ballet are exceptional. The costumes are gorgeous, true to the French-style that Tchaikovsky was going for when he wrote this (he was said to be modeling the court of King Louis XIV). The principal dancers in the roles of Aurora and Prince Desire, as well as the evil fairy, express themselves fully in their solos. Fancy footwork, pas de deux, lavish corp and the ensuing divertissements in Aurora and the Prince's wedding are fine examples of how great the ballet is visually on DVD and in the hands of the Russians.
Act I begins with the theme associated with the evil fairy, dark, powerful and fatalistic, but is subdued when the hopeful, romantically melodic theme of the Lilac Fairy (Aurora's fairy godmother) erupts into a glorius introduction. The kingdom prepares for Aurora's christening (The March) and congregate in the hall of the castle. The fairies endow the child with special qualities, beauty, grace, song, etc..keep in mind this is not all  that different from the Dysney film or the fairy tale. When the Lilac Fairy is about to bestow her gift on the baby, the evil fairy and her minions storm the castle and the evil fairy rages in her fury about not being invited. In revenge, she casts a dark spell on the child. She will prick her finger on a pointy spindle and die. Of course, the Lilac Fairy offers hope and reverses some of the spell. Aurora will sleep and not die, awaken only after the kiss of her true love prince. Also, the entire kingdom will sleep with her. Act 2 features Aurora as a young woman who is awakening to her femininity, celebrating her sixteenth birthday, surrounded by loving and doting parents and many interested princely suitors. The Waltz, the Rose Adagio and Aurora's Death are the highlights. In the final act, the Prince, with the help of the Lilac Fairy, defeats the evil fairy, penetrates the castle and awakens the sleeping beauty with a kiss. Their wedding features many characters from fairy tales, including Cinderella and Puss'N'Boots. The Apotheose ends gloriously, and is without doubt Tchaikovksy's most brilliant work for orchestra.
This ballet is a great introduction for ballet novices, a lesson in good choreography and over all, a glittering rendition of the masterful art. Who says ballet is sentimental nonsense ? It is a passionate, engulfing and living art form that requires stamina, endurance and precision, full of magnetism and full of life. This  particular ballet can be enjoyed in many levels. Children will like the fairy tale ambiance, adults will enjoy the developing ballet structure and balletomanes will be in heaven. I am a ballet/ music and opera teacher and encourage any medium to instill a love of the arts. On DVD, ballet is a must see, almost, but never quite, like, seeing a live performance.",1040428800,41,3321,4.884751773049645
810112,4,6304218036,"The uppers:
This was such a great performance of this ballet.  The camera angles helped compliment the dancers and Larissa is adorable as Princess Aurora.  The set, costumes, and corps  helped to accent the principle dancers.  The choreography was well done to the music and the orchestral balance was fine tuned.  They also included all the most memorable songs and themes.  Many movie verson cut some out due to available tape time, but this one kept to the original main themes.
The downers:
They tried to add some Computer Graphics at one point that was rather annoying, but they did not interfere with the ballet so it is permissible.  They DID happen to cut off the corps at some points and the corps got rejected for more intricate choreography, and they repeated their movements quite a bit. Still, it is one of the better corps parts that I have seen.

810157,5,6304218036,"I have 2 versions of Sleeping Beauty with me; 1 is this DVD and the other copy is the Bolshoi Ballet's Sleeping Beauty which they performed for their Japan tour in the 1980s.

I personally prefer this version because of:

1. Excellent choreography particularly in Act 1 with the entrance of the Corps de Ballet and the various fairies
2. Nice acting towards Act 1 and Act 2 where the evil fairy forcibly removes the hair of the King's servant in her anger
3. An excellent demonstration of the Kirov style

810159,2,6304218036,"This review is prompted by two motives: firstly to excoriate those who have passively allowed their inappropriate reviews to be used by Amazon in deliberately misleading their consumers; secondly to correct the euphoria about this Kirov DVD that is the result of this deception. As I and many others have pointed out, this site is a mish-mash of reviews of two performances of the ballet by the Kirov at different times, in different cities, with different casts, and in different formats (VHS and DVD).
This DVD is a soup of sin and virtue swimming in the same pool simultaneously. The main virtue is the stunning technical virtuosity and mechanical precision of every single participating dancer, soloist or chorus, throughout these tedious 3 acts. The settings and costumes look regally expensive. The character acting of the non-dancers is in the Stanislavsky tradition; that of the dancers is non-existent. Leznhina as Princess Aurora wears a fixed idiotic smile throughout, apart from her 100 years of sleep and the incident of the poisonous prick that precipitated it. Ruzmatov as the Prince makes being in love look like an awfully boring experience. On the evidence of this disc, Russian dancers are highly effective in conveying the emotions of cats, wolves and foxes ---- even fairies, both Good and Evil --- but those of human mortals seem beyond them.  As a Canadian, I am thoroughly ashamed of the terrible production standards displayed by the Canadian team in the filming of this Montreal performance. The camera angles are often bizarre, bisecting the chorus or, as on at least one occasion,  filming the very edge of the troupe so that all you can see of them is a chaotic wave of arms truncated at the elbows or shoulders flapping at the left edge of the screen. Their success In creating a thoroughly unsatisfactory visual and accoustical  experience received much help from the orchestra that sounded thin and tinny, and the conductor whose ineptness persuaded them be so. They even had a lot of assistance from the deceased. Petipa's choreography is routinely dull and predictable ---- if Modern Dance did not already exist, he would have made its creation necessary. As for the music of Peter Illyich! He has done something of which most would regard him incapable: producing 2 hours of continuous music with only one memorable tune. It takes a lot of credulity to believe that on two other occasions he produced ballets as musically superlative as Swan Lake and Nutcracker. This whole sad production is frozen in the past as securely as the Sleeping Beauty herself.",1338768000,4,2589,5.002320185614849
810160,2,6304218036,"I love the Kirov.  And I love Sleeping Beauty.  But as I believe at least one reviewer pointed out, you need night vision goggles to view this dvd up until the final act.

810161,1,6304218036,"This tape is is dim that no amount of tinkering helps--at times it gives only the barest idea of what must have been going on before the cameras.  On this occasion the orchestra plays so badly out of tune and hits so many clunkers that it feels like you're hearing a high school ensemble--very disappointing indeed!  Asylmuratova looks like she must have been lovely in the role as for Zaklinsky watching him is like listening to a second or third string singer at the Met, he hits all the notes but not necessarily beautifully.  This is the Kirov after all.  You expect better.  From what is visible on this dim tape the Bluebird in this performance far outdances the Prince.  This is at best a collector's tape for someone who simply must see Asylmuratova otherwise if you want the Kirov buy the DVD of Kolpakova or Lezhnina.",1278806400,,827,4.591836734693878

810165,3,6304218036,"I am a big fan of the Russian Ballet. I celebrate the Russian approach of fine bravura dancing. However Sleeping Beauty requires a certain degree of restraint stylistically. This is a very fine production. The dancing is good technically and I like all the ballerinas. However Mr. Rouzamatov provides the same performance whether he is dancing Don quixote, Scheherazade or Sleeping Beauty. Each piece is very different and Sleeping Beauty requires constraint in order to capture the elegance of the character. It is not all about big jumps and virtuosic turns. For this reason, in my opinion, the piece suffers.

I much prefer the Royal Ballet's treatment of sleeping Beauty.",1127433600,8,675,5.136363636363637
