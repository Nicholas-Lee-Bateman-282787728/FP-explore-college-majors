5188208,5,B008X8VM1W,"I am not old enough to have seen ""In Search Of"" in it's original 1976-1982 TV run, but I was first exposed to it as a kid via re-runs on A&E in the '90s, and then again on the History Channel in the early 2000s. I always loved all things weird, so the show was a dream come true for me. I especially loved the crazy synthesizer score, Leonard Nimoy's creepy voice narrations, and the campy re-enactments featured on the show. Many of the unsolved mysteries featured on the show have been ""solved"" since the show's original run. It didn't matter though; this show was just plain awesome. I was really disappointed when the History Channel finally stopped showing the re-runs. Years later, I was able to watch VHS rips of the episodes on Youtube, which held me over for a little while.

When I finally heard that VEI had secured the rights to release the complete series on DVD, I knew that my prayers had been answered. I am happy to say that I just received my copy of the boxset today and I am watching the episodes right now! The box set features all six seasons of the original series hosted by Leonard Nimoy. The set also features the ""revival"" seventh season from 2002 that was hosted by Mitch Pileggi (from ""The X-Files""). There's also a special bonus disc which includes the two original TV specials which were hosted by Rod Serling (from ""The Twilight Zone""). Rod Serling was originally going to host the TV series, but he passed away after making the two TV specials and the job was then given to Leonard Nimoy.

For those of you who have been wondering, these are the original versions of the episodes which were featured in the 1976-1982 TV run (complete with the original red background title sequence). These are NOT the edited versions which were featured on A&E in the '90s, nor are they the other edited versions which were featured on the History Channel in the 2000s. The video/audio quality is as good as can be for an old TV show like this. Granted, it doesn't look like it was filmed yesterday, but the quality is far better than the VHS rips found on YouTube. There were also some rumors that Leonard Nimoy would be filming some new ""updates"" on some of the episodes. Sadly, these were just rumors. The DVD set does not feature any special bonus features of any kind, just the episodes themselves. I was also hoping that maybe there would be some sort of accompanying booklet to go along with the DVDs, but no such luck again. Aside from those two things, this is a great DVD boxset that I am excited to see after so many years. If you're a fan of Cryptozoology, Ufology, the Paranormal, Ancient History, Mysteries, Conspiracy Theories, etc., then this boxset is for you!",1355097600,206,6348,4.814678899082569
5188209,1,B008X8VM1W,"This show made its appearance when I was in my mid H.S. years. Back then it brought to light a lot of interesting phenomena that was going on.

Only now when you watch all the Alien and UFO shows on TV do you discover that back then you were hearing mostly a bunch of quacks, frauds and conspiracy theorists making it all seem to real to be discarded. Well everything any of the people on this show ever said or predicted has not come to pass at all. I have yet to be attacked by killer bees or surf my house into the Pacific Ocean because of the horrible soon to pass Earthquake that would hit California. Most evidence shows Nessie to be a Tourist trap more then anything reasonably possible in the crypto zoology dept. No one has nailed a Bigfoot 40 years since then and of course the Patterson film we know has been exposed as a hoax since that episode aired and nowadays they again bring out the same nutcases on every show to claim about Govt Coverups, Area 51. Bob Lazar the guy who had people groveling at his feet about UFOs at groom lake has proven to be a liar both verbally and credential wise. The Bermuda Triangle now has more logical scientific explanations other then a UFO vortex into other dimensions. All the kooks and conspiracists have turned a couple of great channels that originally based on legitimate science and history into UFO File, Alien Conspiracy etc, all of it has its roots in ""In search of"" the biggest batch of supernatural science ever aired on Tv for years.

Why anybody would want to relive hearing the same bunch of mush that was bogus when it aired and gave rise to more whackos and people who have seen a lot, but cant put their flying saucers where their mouths are.  I bet the people of Hiroshima probably thought that the B-29 Bomber Enola Gay flying by itself had actually been a UFO that crashed and caused all that death and plague like conditions and wiped out an entire city. Certainly only the advanced powers of Aliens could unleash that kind of horror. And on it goes. Making money for hack writers and as Mark Twain said ""A novel is something everyone praises but nobody reads"" The same for all claims made on shows like this. Everyone has filmed lights in the sky, but nobody has ever brought an ET home for dinner.

And of course, this was all started by Von Danikens, whose Chariot of the Gods as serious research is totally refuted in the book ""Crash go the Chariots"" where the author makes Von Daniken into the laughingstock he should be.",1355097600,16,2497,4.445414847161572
5188210,3,B008X8VM1W,"Original theme song, original opening graphics/titles, original breaks and bumpers or NO SALE. If anyone gets the definitive answer on the content of this set, please post and/or reply!",1350432000,16,185,5.413793103448276
5188211,5,B008X8VM1W,"Finally !! I've been waiting for this show to be available on DVD for a long time, I'm so happy right now !! If you are not aware, IN SEARCH OF... is simply one of the best TV shows ever made, a true classic. This show hosted by the legendary Leonard Nimoy was ahead of its time and documented various phenomenas that wasn't ""cool"" or en vogue like today ( UFOs, Ghosts, Serial killers, Cryptozoology, etc. ). Today there's hundreds of shows about the Paranormal or strange phenomenas, it's all over the place. But back in the late 70's - early 80's there was only one show who dared to talk about the Paranormal and other mysteries, and that was IN SEARCH OF...

On this set you'll find all the legendary episodes: Bigfoot, Jack the Ripper, DB Cooper, Ghosts, UFOs, the Loch Ness Monster, Jimmy Hoffa, the death of Marilyn Monroe, the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, the Bermuda Triangle, the Amityville horror, Sherlock Holmes, and so many more. This is one of the reasons why this show is so amazing, these episodes covers so many different but fascinating topics ( see the full listing at the end of my review ). One episode might talk about Ghosts, then the next might talk about natural phenomenons, then the next might talk about an historical mystery, then the next might talk about an unsolved crime....The show covers so many different mysteries, this is what makes this show so addictive and so unforgettable. The show is always interesting, full of fascinating informations, and is a must-see for anybody who enjoy a good mystery.

So this 21-Disc collection contains the entire series, in all you'll find 145 fascinating episodes. Each episode is 22 minutes long. Also included on this set is a short documentary about the show, hosted by mr. Nimoy himself. Here is the full listing, every episodes for every seasons.

5188212,5,B008X8VM1W,"What a great show! So campy, and informative at the same time. Nimoy's narration is the best, along with the greats of the era like Welles, Serling, and even Burr. I hope this has the original opening theme and introduction graphics. On a side-note, will this prompt other great ""reality"" and documentary programs from that era to be released?

Of course to younger people used to high definition screens, and blue ray discs, the series naturally has the look of something that was shot in the 70's, but so what, it adds to the feel and time period from which this show was made.

5188262,5,B008X8VM1W,"To say that this show was integral to my childhood would be a gross understatement. My dad loved this show and never missed it, the fact that he was a huge Star Trek fan who was fascinated by the idea of alien visitors, lost worlds, unknown creatures, etc. meant this was almost made for him.

While bigfoot, Loch Ness monster and a few other ""mysteries"" have been exposed as hoaxes, the one thing that is definitely real is the fond memories and nostalgia associated with the show. I only wish my father was still around to share them with.

But we definitely know time travel is real, because when I watch this show I am instantly taken back to my living room in the late 1970s and looking over to my dad to ask ""Is that true?"" I usually got a ""who knows?"" or a ""could be..."" and that made the world I lived in so much more interesting.

5188265,5,B008X8VM1W,"This series was and is great. I can finally see the entire series. It seems like I was never able to catch the show when it was on originally and syndication seemed to omit some shows and play others more. As someone said it is the grandfather of all the Ancient Aliens and mystery shows of today. It still holds up today even with all the later discoveries that have been made. And it's great to hear early theories before some of todays discoveries. I love the old 70's music, format and film techniques. A lot of the background music has a Moog synthesizer sound so it's like Clockwork Orange or Tron, Walter Carlos sounding. It is square and not wide screen, perfect on an old iBook G4. I wish it had all four of the early Rod Serling specials, which I haven't seen yet. They only run about 22 minutes per episode without commercials, so they are great for binge watching of a quick trip to the treadmill/elliptical. It is amazing the amount of DVD's for the price. Obviously Leonard Nimoy is fantastic sporting some terrific 70's fashion and style. In re-watching the series it does seem more factual based and presenting topics for the viewer to make up their mind as opposed to many of todays shows that are definitely biased, one sided.",1455494400,,1244,4.533333333333333

Well worth the money. This is the original classic narrated by Leonard Nimoy with music by Rinder and Lewis. An excellent value for a third of the original price. I would buy this now as I dought that this will be re-issued again. Would make an excellent gift for anyone interested in the paranormal or historical curiosities.  Many fine episodes: the Coral Castle, Jack the Ripper, the Bimini Wall (Atlantis,) ESP, Psychic Detectives and Oak Island stand out just to name a few.  Note- Some of these episodes were not archived well at all (think 1970's t.v. antena quality.)

5188289,4,B008X8VM1W,"I remember as a kid - this show both fascinated me (and at times scared the hell out of me).  You can catch bootlegs on youTube but there is nothing like owning a set like this.

The packaging is fantastic - with great artwork and a fun design.  Inside are multi-disc standard width DVD cases - transparent so you can see the reverse case jacket when open.  Collectors will love it; even the discs are great looking.  Check the pics!

The DVD menus are basic - with motion thumbnails but little else.

Considering the source material - the video quality is just ""ok"".  It beats the bootlegs running around the internet, but if you're hoping for any sort of remastering or clean up?  It isn't here.  The shows are presented full frame 4:3 as they were originally aired.

The show itself is hypnotic; thanks in part to Nimoy's voice and delivery and also the odd and often haunting synthesizer sounds from the 70s.

The content is great; you'll find everything from Loch Ness Monster to Cults and everything in between.  While the show's data is obviously 40 years old - strangely enough, it doesn't seem that way.  While ""theory and conjecture"" are thrown in - it feels similar to anything you see on History Channel or similar cable channels.

This box set represents dozens upon dozens of hours of excellent entertainment.  I take a way a star due to the aged video - but again, I knew what to expect.",1441929600,13,1402,4.548

One especially creepy & disturbing episode talks about the practice of voodoo! Another talks about the Rev. Jim Jones!

5188298,5,B008X8VM1W,"We are now in Season 3 and working our way through. First, a note on the episode quality. Most of these episodes are 32-38 years old. The source masters were not the greatest it appears so the quality of the episodes does suffer. Despite that we have been enjoying the series. I watched most of the episodes as a kid. What I like about this is you see footage of places (people climbing the exterior of the Great Pyramid!) and interviews with people on topics that you just don't see today or which have continued to remain fringe topics (e.g., plants reacting to music in an experiment at the Denver Botanic Gardens). The series was very influential for me personally in helping me develop into an intellectually curious person. It is also interesting to see the research that was ""in vogue"" in the '70s such as ESP, Bigfoot, Voodoo, Mystery Hill, Bimini Road, Bermuda/Great Lakes Triangle, Jack the Ripper, etc. Some of the things they explore have either been solved or mostly figured out, if not definitively. What we like to do is write down topics and names of individual researchers and scientists and seek them out on the Internet to see what happened with them or what is going on today in that topic of study. This is a must series if you liked the series. It might seem especially dated or not as interesting to younger viewers.",1437350400,3,1339,4.606694560669456
5188299,5,B008X8VM1W,"This was a great series that brings back nostalgic memories.  Leonard Nimoy's narration and the eerie music combine to set the mood for exploring a variety of mysterious and controversial subjects.  Despite its age, the show holds up well.  I like the fact that the producers don't seem to champion or espouse any particular theories about the mysteries; rather they just present the subject matter as a teaser and then let you decide for yourself or research further.  And it's also nice to hear Nimoy's voice again; he brings a certain charismatic gravitas to the series.",1436832000,,573,4.9375
5188300,5,B008X8VM1W,"let's be honest here: for all our alleged progress, we're living in a world we have yet to entirely decipher, and there is much amidst us we have yet to definitively explain. as skeptical or sophisticated as some of us we wanna think we are, there's that one node in the back of the mind which likes to speculate and wonder. something deeply ingrained in us actually wants there be to a Bermuda Triangle and a Loch Ness Monster. some key building block of the human genome wants UFOs and psychic phenomena to exist. and what more fitting tour guide than Spock?
it does have one inevitable weakness in that it can't always help being behind the times. when Nimoy states that no disease frightens it's victims more than cancer, you can't help wondering ""what about AIDS?"" there are a couple searches for still-at-large Nazis, most significantly Dr. Joseph Mengela, who've no doubt shuffled their mortal coils by now. one episode concerns a terrorist identified only as ""Carlos,"" who robbed the OPEC offices as was designated ""the most wanted man in the world."" having never heard of this Carlos anywhere else, i'm guessing the matter has been either resolved or abandoned by now.
i sometimes think that History Channel-type documentaries (some of which manage to stay in circulation for upwards of 20 years) should carry a disclaimer: ""NOTICE: this program was produced at such-and-such a time and as such reflects what was known, believed, and/or assumed then. it's possible that in the interim it's questions have been answered or it's theories disproved. (truth to tell, at the rate knowledge fluctuates, it most likely wasn't what you'd call up-to-date for more than a few months.)""
just a thought.
also, i have to say i find the borderline synth-pop theme song somewhat incongruous.
and at least one mystery herein is beast left unsolved: what happened to Glen Miller? i know i speak for all music lovers everywhere when i say, who cares?
but overall the series is fascinating. by fortunate chance it's only in technical matters, processes or technology, where it's age shows. on the whole it investigates matters that remain tantalizingly oblique. it's perhaps at it's most noteworthy when covering enigmas that seem to of since been lost in the shuffle. for instance, there's the tale of of St. Germain, ""The Man Who Would Not Die."" legend has it this European dandy was (or is) immortal. even contemporaries generally believed him to be in his 150s or thereabouts. or how about Ogopogo, who's sort of a Canadian Loch Ness monster. ever heard of that one?
i have to say i wasn't terribly enamored of the reboot with Mitch Peleggi. the way they cram four stories into a single episode (rather than devoting a whole episode to a single investigation) only serves to narrow the scope. the fact that it retreads more than a few original series stories isn't much help, either.
but i won't let it damper my enthusiasm for the original. you need look no further for a healthy diet of metaphysical speculations, conspiracy theories, and should-be myths that just won't die. i almost hope we never verify Bigfoot or learn what became of Amelia Earhart, as that would decrease something of this delightful series.",1435968000,,3209,4.889908256880734

Back then, this was the only show of it's kind and on top of being well-produced, it had benefit of ""Mr. Spock"" as the show's host. What kid wouldn't love that?!? Nowadays, there are multiple series and even entire networks devoted to these fringe topics. But back in the day, this was your only outlet for such fare. The topics are wide-ranging and very interesting. They are more of a glossy overview of a particular subject rather than an exhaustive in-depth exploration, due to the 30-minute running time and the fact that lots of the topics simply cannot be 100% solved one way or the other, neither then nor today. I didn't realize back then how long the show lasted and how many episodes there were. I was just into the monster & ghost stuff.  Watching now, there are several shows from each season that my wife & I had never seen when we were younger, and we've found them to be really fun and quite compelling. These shows are (almost without exception) perfectly safe viewing for all family members, and a neat way to explore a lot of pretty unusual topics with kids in a safe, non-threatening manner. And now with the internet, you can watch these episodes and then Google the subject matter for more info and recent updates/activity. Very cool and rather interactive in that way.

The shows themselves look decent enough, considering their age and the fact that they were NOT restored or given any lavish remastering process. The colors are a bit over-saturated and the focus isn't razor-sharp, but they look better than I remember from watching them on an old UHF station back in the day. They appear to be complete, too. Sound mix is strong & level. Interactive menus are your basic two page scan & select deal. My wife & I are both binge-watching these, averaging one disc a night. We're already towards the end of season 3. This series is a lot of fun - even though they never really solve anything conclusively (do ANY of these shows/series/networks?). Leonard Nimoy brings instant gravity & respectability to the proceedings and no matter how 'out there' the subject matter may be, his voice-over narration and wrap around host segments are delivered very straightforward and absolutely serious. He was most certainly an excellent alternate choice as host when Rod Serling passed away before ISO went to series.  BTW... Serling's two episodes are a fun look at what might have been, if he'd lived long enough to host the entire run of IN SEARCH OF.  Haven't gotten to the Mitch Pileggi-hosted remake shows yet. I remember them when those first came out. Didn't last too long though. Probably too much competition from other shows and cable TV by the time his version aired. ""IN SEARCH OF... The Complete Series"" comes nicely packaged in an attractive fiberboard box that holds the entire series, with each season stored in its own clear snap case, with 3 discs per season. The Mitch Pileggi version and Rod Serling's stuff are lumped together in the final case.

Well done and hours & hours of fun... ""IN SEARCH OF..."" easily rates a solid 5 STARS from me.",1429056000,,3146,4.721311475409836
5188321,4,B008X8VM1W,"My brother and I watched this when it originally aired in the '70s, when UFOs and Bigfoot were ""all the rage"". It's fun watching it all over again, and there is a lot more here than I remember. So low budget but no less entertaining, especially Leonard Nimoy's spiffy wardrobe. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is so poorly transferred to video - we don't expect perfection (after all, it doesn't advertise itself as digitally remastered), but after attempting to clean spots off the TV screen, we discovered it was actually dust on the video itself, left by the scanner used to copy the film. Or perhaps a poltergeist wanted to leave it's mark.",1428796800,,659,4.593220338983051

I remember these were shown on cable in the early 2000s and had new intro titles and were missing the spooky theme music (hoping these DVDs have the episodes' opening intact). I loved this show as a kid, but it also scared me. Just the overall mood and vibe was eerie (the excellent Rinder & Lewis scores really added to that!).

5188325,5,B008X8VM1W,"Five stars, but only if you know what you are getting. And what you are getting is 1970s crunchy goodness, with Nimoy to boot. What you are not getting is anything like real science or history. Taken as 1970s high camp, however, it is wonderful, and perhaps the best thing about the show is the synthy music. The show is also nostalgia provoking for those of us who came of age while it was running. Other reviewers here are right to point out the mediocre transfer with visible compression artifacts and a graininess I don't recall in the original. The price is right, however, and with one exception the discs have all played well. The pilot movies and the reboot series are nice bonus features.",1427155200,,697,4.584

5188328,4,B008X8VM1W,"Before there was Arthur C. Clarke Mysterious World, Unsolved Mysteries, and Ancient Aliens there was In Search of that ran from 1976-1982 with a one season revival in 2002. Ironically, due to my age i was more familiar with the 2002 season which dealt with darker subject matter as the occult and demons. However, as i grew up on Unsolved Mysteries i knew this show was a pre-cursor to UM and influenced it. Many years ago there were bootleg versions of the set being sold for well over $100.

The show is a bit outdated and some of it is political incorrect today as referring to Blacks as ""Negroes"" or Native Americans as ""Indians"" who are really located in a different continent. However, the more disturbing are some of the animal experiments shown on the show which definitely would be edited out or left out of a modern show. Most of the animals experimented are in the science related shows.  One episode on Sharks had a smaller shark species killed for the show simply so it could attract a  Great White Shark.  Even for nearly 40 years ago that exercised poor judgment from the producer  who wanted ratings that badly.

Overall, the packaging and video quality is pretty good.  Compared to other shows i think the video holds up well especially if watched on hi-fi tv.  Of course, don't expect modern DVD quality on this due to the limitations of the film.

I think the best done episodes are on biographies as Earhart, Monroe, Lindbergh, and Kennedy Assassination. Nimoy is pretty good although some may have preferred original show host Rod Serling who did three specials before he died. Those who are completist will notice that two docs are left out one called ""The Outer Space Connection"" and ""Manbeast Myth or Monster.""  It may have been a licensing or simply production issue why it was left out.  However, those two are widely available on the net and can be seen. Moreover, the Manbeast special already has some previous footage used already on the show as that show aired in 1980.

For those who were fans of the series this set does satisfy in both packaging and transfer quality. If you like Ancient Aliens, Unsolved Mysteries, or shows on the Paranormal this will give you hours of entertainment,",1426550400,,2218,4.702842377260982

As far as the quality, I have to say the audio is superb and the video is awesome. It has a film grittiness to the quality which adds to it.

A few years ago, I came across a DVDR set of season one only, transferred directly from the original 16mm reels. I bought them, and the quality is stunning. There is NO comparing it to the rest of the series which I also have, but from the edited 90's A&E tapes. The 16mm episodes I have look so good, it's as though they were filmed yesterday. It's a shame this new boxed set isn't ALL transferred from original 16mm sources, but after 40 years it seems likely that the first season is the only survivor in such excellent quality. THIS BOXED SET is a dream come true. The packaging is very eye-catching, the way the box opens at the top like a chest is very nice; overall a very fine presentation. The picture quality is very good, closely matching that of the 16mm transfers I have. Sound quality is excellent.
I am totally thrilled that I finally have this full unedited set, and for such a great price. I was 13 years old when the series first aired on tv, and it has never faded in my memory. Thank you VEI, and Universal Studios!",1415577600,2,1100,4.339805825242719

Seven DVDs are in a nice box with a swing-back lid. Each DVD case is colorful, as well as the individual DVDs. The box set also includes the 2002 series hosted by Mitch Pileggi, and the bonus TV movies 'In Search of Ancient Astronauts', and 'In Search of Ancient Mysteries', both hosted by Rod Serling.

One drawback with the DVD collection is the lack of interviews with Mr. Nimoy, Production Supervisor Kay Hoffman, and others
who did a wonderful job editing and selecting a wide variety of topics. Another is the DVD collection is not digitally remastered, so the flaws in the original editing appear in the DVDs. Removing these flaws would have added to the overall quality of the release.

The whole series was recorded to VHS tapes taken from The History channel then put on to DVD's so the quality wasn't that good at all. But I love this series so much that I got used to it.  I saw it again on ebay a few years later and bought it for the second time, Same thing, recorded off of The History channel but it was recorded to more DVD's and the quality was better. So after finding it on here and reading the reviews I didn't hesitate to buy it for the third time. (Third times a charm) So I should have it in a couple of days, I cant wait to get it. I just hope I'm still kicking when they decide to release it on Blu-ray. That would be heaven.

Update. The picture and sound quality of these 30 plus year old ""In Search Of"" episodes are better than I had hoped for. Just like watching them on TV back in the late 70's early 80's pretty darn good. To make the picture better I changed the aspect ratio on my flat screen TV from the 16-9 HD to the 4-3 with the pillars on either side and that made a difference to the picture quality.
The copies that I have that were recorded off of the history channel were edited by the history channel and missing around 3-4 minutes on a lot of the episodes, These have not been edited. Really happy with the set.",1406851200,3,1438,4.024475524475524

I grew up being taught to have have an open mind, and even though some of the suggestions in these episodes are silly, they are still fun and even educational. Definitely a ""Free Thinkers"" kind of show. You simply CAN'T beat Leonard Nimoy as the host. Even though some people would scoff at the obvious way this show dates itself, VERY much a product of the 70's, that is, for me at least, part of its charm! It really is like going back in time! There has been no ""updating"" or other modern editing, you get to see each episode EXACTLY as it was seen in 1976-77. Three of my favorite episodes are the one about the Hindenburg crash, the one about Vlad Dracula and the one about the REAL Sherlock Holmes. The one about Bigfoot is fun too,  since I am from the Pacific Northwest. The picture quality is as good as it was back on a 70's television set, so videophiles aren't going to be thrilled, but again, for me, that is part of the charm. I would recommend this set, it really is a great old series and is just a lot of fun.",1400112000,3,1098,4.228571428571429

Of course the program is from years ago and a lot has changed, but this is still hours and hours and hours of enjoyment :)",1398556800,3,345,4.40625
5188386,5,B008X8VM1W,"I watched this as a kid.  I have always been a fan of Leonard Nimoy.  I started watching ""Star Trek"" when I was a two year old girl, and had always had a bit of a crush on Spock.

I know a lot of customers complained about the lack of any real special features, or the fact that the episodes weren't remastered, but honestly, I think that's a big selling point for me.

For one thing, we did not have HD TVs back when this had its original run from 1976-1982.  (I don't believe the series is closed captioned or subtitled either.  So that would make it hard for someone who is deaf or hearing impaired to enjoy it.)

Some episodes are low volume, and some of them have the video off track with the audio but to me that is OK.  It is the way we originally enjoyed it on TV. Each disc in the series says that there are technical anomalies inherent with vintage footage, so what you see is what you get.  It's a great nostalgic series for any fan of missing persons, UFOs, the unexplained, or strange.  It covers it all.

It is no more or less out there than ""Ancient Aliens"" which covers much of the same material.

As a bonus, there was a reboot a few years later with Mitch Pileggi who played Agent Skinner on ""The X Files"", and also, the original pilot episodes hosted by Rod Serling included  this set.  This was one of those little special indulgences that I rarely get and I have been enjoying it immensely.  I did wait on the price to drop quite a bit before I could afford it but it was worth every penny to me.  I am pleased to finally have this in my collection.

On a good side note, my 14 year old son is a Leonard Nimoy fan and he's been enjoying these right along with me.  I relearned some things I had previously forgotten aobut and also learned new things.

So I am not disappointed in the least with anything about this set. It comes beautifully boxed for display too.",1397433600,5,1884,4.197771587743732
5188387,5,B008X8VM1W,"I am also too young for when these first aired, but I grew up watching them in syndication and being utterly fascinated.  I love joking around and I love mysterious and unsolved topics, so this is one of my favorite shows!  The cheesy reenactments and bizarre music coupled with Nimoy's legendary voice makes for quite a fun time!  The perfection of this can be found in the episode ""The Man Who Would Not Die.""  TOO FUNNY!  I love it!

Nowadays global warming is going to kill us all.  When I was in grade school it was the hole in the ozone layer that was going to destroy life as we know it.  In Search Of.... takes us back to a simpler time when scientists knew that that ""Killer Bees"", ""Fire Ants"" and ""The Coming Ice Age"" were the real, serious and immediate threats to humanity's survival.  If ""Bigfoot"", the ""Loch Ness Monster"" and ""Alien Visitors"" had to find out what happened to us in this frozen, bee and ant infested wasteland, perhaps the best thing to do is to do what those researching ""The Lost Colony of Roanoke"" did and look amongst a pile of rocks in the basement of an old women's college.  Man, I LOVE the insanity of this show!

5188388,5,B008X8VM1W,"Let me be clear:  I absolutely loathe exercising. But the sad truth is that nature decided to zap me with diabetes, so to the elliptical I go, at least five days a week, for anywhere between 45-75 minutes.  About the only thing that makes exercising tolerable is the 32-inch LCD screen hanging on the wall in my exercise room.  Back in the 1970s, I began a life long absorption in Star Trek.  Back then, the only incarnation was The Original Series, so I watch the repeats of the original episodes, over...and over...and over.  Then, round about 1974, a new series called In Search Of was launched which purported to explore contemporary mysteries, such as the Bermuda Triangle of the disappearance of Amelia Earhart.  As an inveterate Trekker, I committed myself to watching In Search Of solely because it was hosted by Leonard Nimoy.  Nowadays, the DVD set of In Search Of transports me (HA!) back to the mid 70s, and makes the hours spent on the elliptical infinitely more tolerable.  Each episode is produced in easily digestible 23 minute chunks (the original broadcasts lasted but a half hour)--which helps the intrepid elliptical artist measure out 45 minutes almost exactly.  Nimoy's outlandish 70s attire, and the fillings-in-your-teeth rattling synthesized musical score, take me WAY back.  I am also charmed as an adult to see how much I missed as a boy:  mainly the pains taken by the show to avoid saying anything whatsoever of substance.  Very few facts are revealed, and none of the mysteries explored on the show are ever solved.  But no one should take this as a criticism.  It is pure joy, and money enormously well spent.",1396915200,6,1640,4.831541218637993

This set is suppose to be all 144 episodes, but one website (everything2.com/title/In+Search+of) claims there were 148 episodes.  Is the Crystal Skull a missing episode?  I don't see it as one of the titles.  Aside from that, this is a GREAT series with great topics, even if many have been disproven.

5188391,4,B008X8VM1W,"The original list price for this box set was $150, but it is now available for the rock bottom price of only $50!!! Yes, this is the original series with Leonard Nimoy, featuring the classic music & title sequence. You get all seven seasons, with most seasons consisting of 24 episodes that run approximately 22 minutes each. The box set further includes the 2 original pilots made with Rod Serling who sadly passed away prior the series run. The box set features nice packaging & artwork with each season enclosed in its own 3 DVD clam-shell case, plus the entire set fits into a large decorative box with a lid.

The series featured thoughtful & entertaining looks at various phenomena such as Bigfoot, Atlantis, aliens, voodoo, Noah's Flood, & near death experiences; to name but a few of the episode topics. Nimoy does a fine job as narrator, and the research & production values are generally decent. However, there was a tendency to rely heavily on stock footage and some of the recreations look rather cheap. Some of the research presented in the series has since been proven false; that being said, I think the shows have far more kitsch/novelty value than educational merit. Anyone who grew up with the show will be pleased that all of the series episodes are presented here in their original broadcast format; plus you get the 2 pilots as well all the 1990's revival episodes from A & E. At $50 for all seven seasons, this works out to just $7.14 per season.....and you can't beat that!!!!!!!!!

The main draw back of this set is the picture & sound quality. It was not remastered from original film elements. The quality is not bad, but it does not compare with other period programs that were shot on 35mm film and then remastered from the original prints for DVD release. My understanding is that the original show was shot on film and then edited onto a videotape master for the original broadcast run. Supposedly the original film elements from the series are no longer available, only the videotapes. If you are a picture and sound quality geek, you will be disappointed by this release. In particular the two Rod Serling pilots are rather low picture quality.

It's nice that VEI appears to have taken such care in providing a quality product for the fans.  Hopefully I don't run into any of the DVD layering problems some of the reviews have commented on.

As with any TV series, the quality of each episode depends on the writer and staff involved in creating it. The episode on Noah's Ark, for example, is particularly bad, as though it was written by a Biblical literalist. The episode on Lee Harvey Oswald can only be called disinformation, featuring interviews with Edward J. Epstein (who became friendly with the CIA's James Jesus Angleton) and Michael Eddowes, both of whom pushed the absurd ""KGB killed Kennedy"" theory.

This review though, primarily addresses the DVD release.

I'm disappointed with this release.  First of all, I understand that the show was filmed on 16mm film, so a perfectly crystal clear picture is quite simply unattainable.  Having said that, it still would have been nice to see some modicum of cleanup of dust and scratches from the film performed, perhaps even a bit of basic color correction.  At the very least one would think that they could have at least made the effort to make transfers off of the original material rather than network video tapes.  Clearly nothing was done in this regard, which is what makes it little better than the bootlegs you may already own.  Each disk begins with the text, ""This DVD contains technical anomalies that are inherent in historical footage,"" which is essentially the producer's way of providing a disclaimer for the lack of restoration.

I also discovered, particularly in the Loch Ness Monster episode, that there are certain episodes with sound issues, almost a kind of echoing, as though the sound track were phasing.

I'm also disappointed with the lack of extras.  I thought I had read somewhere that updates to the shows would be included in the set, but there are no updates to be found.  I also was hoping for new interviews or commentary with Nimoy.  There is none.  Very disappointing that a show like this doesn't have a good amount of extras, particularly after having to wait so long for it to be finally released.

Of course, maybe they're saving the extras and a full restoration to make folks double dip on a Blu Ray set.  Who knows.

In any case, if you already have bootlegs, don't bother spending the money on this set.",1378512000,4,1897,4.7
5188412,3,B008X8VM1W,"Love the show, happy with the picture quality, wish I could keep it and watch them all, but I've had to move discs around between 3 players in order to finish episodes. Disc 1 and 2 from the first season both had freeze-ups, skipping and such starting with the layer change which is around 1:28:00 in 'Play All' mode on both discs. On my 2011 LG blu-ray player, disc 1 simply froze and would not advance at all. Was able to finish that disc on my ancient (2005) Pioneer player. So when it got to the layer change on the 2nd disc, that one failed in the Pioneer. It would freeze, then jump ahead, then freeze again. I put that disc back into the LG and it finished there. For disc 3 I've been watching in my bedroom on a 2007 Philips DVD recorder, with no problems. I don't always want to watch the show in bed though and should not be forced to try different players in order to finish a DVD. I haven't even opened the remaining seasons, so this is going back for a refund, unfortunately.

I wrote to VEI to ask if they've possibly made new pressings of the discs and perhaps I received an early set with problems, but they haven't responded so I don't have much choice.

Update: I did return the set and VEI informed me that they did in fact have problems with early discs until they switched manufacturers. I ordered one direct from them and have no problems at all on any of the discs.

5188413,4,B008X8VM1W,"To begin with, this series captivated me as a young boy. Watching ""Spock"" discuss all sorts of mysteries and supernatural happenings enveloped my attention when it aired in the early 1980's (mostly repeats but I did catch some of the last seasons when they originally aired). I also watched them again when the History Channel brought them back for a period of time. I bought the ""unofficial"" dvds on the internet a few years ago but was unhappy with the quality (of course I paid next to nothing for them). It was with great anticipation that I found out an official release would be out in a set a year or so ago. Finally acquiring the set with the original opening credits and music was wonderful. The late 1970's and early 1980's vibe is present (my favorite time period for broadcast tv, by the way), and the shows haven't lost any of their appeal. There are a few episodes I was never that crazy about such as ""voodoo"", but for the most part they are excellently presented and very interesting (even if some of the theories have since been disproven).

My only disappointment is that some of the episodes (particularly the pilots with Rod Serling narrating) were not much better quality wise than my old ""unofficial"" dvds. I realize that television and movies have come a long ways resolution wise, and I appreciate grain, but they looked pretty rough.

Of the 20 episodes I checked out, I found that most of the episodes have as a source digital copies from film, probably 16mm film.  Three of the episodes I checked were telecines from film.  Two episodes had an uneven right border in the overscan area, a sign to me that the print source was probably 16mm that had started to decompose.  Not badly but you would have thought Universal could have found better print material.  For that matter, most of the episodes I saw did not have the Universal logo at the end, only the Alan Landsburg Productions (ALP) clapper board icon.  The one episode I most wanted to see, ""The Missing Heir,"" was in good shape.  The trouble is, the colors on this episode were too hot, to the point where image details were smothered by the excess color saturation.  That is almost certainly ALP's fault, skimping on quality control when producing this series. When I see the apparent variation in sources used for this box set, I wonder if one of the reasons for this variation has its roots in the massive Universal film vault fire on June 6, 2008.  By 1977, when ""In Search Of... started its TV run, VCRs were already getting popular and you would think that someone would take care to protect film assets like this TV series.  Judging by the barely adequate transfers to DVD of some of these episodes, you would be wrong to think that Universal makes any major effort to protect the masters of its TV series stored in its film vaults.  The ""In Search Of... box set is something I wanted and the price on sale by a reseller was about $83 plus shipping, which I was willing to pay.  Once this box set goes out of print, the price should zoom up.  I am glad I bought the series, in spite of the fact that mostly second rate image sources were used to master the set's DVDs.",1374192000,2,1948,4.362880886426593
5188416,5,B008X8VM1W,"Long before Monster Quest, Ghost Hunters, UFO Hunters and reality show-like dramas on the boob tube today, there was Leonard Nimoys grand television hit, In Search Of. Ive been waiting for decades for this one to come out, and finally it has to my great joy!  One might be surprised to learn that the naysayer Mr. Spock from Star Trek could actually be a believer in such things, or at least is brave enough to investigate such topics as ghosts, UFOs and Bigfoot openly and without apologies for doing so. In Search Of will take you back to the post-psychedelic 60 idealisms and thrust you back into the what if frame of mind honorably. This is a wonderful show fit for the whole family.
Though a little grainy, we have to remember they just did not have the technology we do today, but thats OKIt kind of puts one in the mood of going back to a simpler day, when you had to adjust the rabbit ears a bit, or use a pair of vice grips to turn the channel.

5188420,5,B008X8VM1W,"I grew up on In Search Of. I was just a kid when it originally aired (from 1976 to 1982), but I only watched it sporadically due to the lack of a television for a couple of years (particularly 1976 to 1978) and maybe my dad wanted to watch something else that night. Then many years later I got to see it as reruns on A&E and The History Channel. The big problem is they replaced the original intro with computer animation and even new music (to make it less ""dated""), and even removed the occasional scene. It literally took until the end of 2012 for In Search Of... to finally make it on DVD, by VEI (Visual Entertainment Incorporated). Leonard Nimoy hosted In Search Of..., although it was Rod Serling that was slated to host the series, but due to his unfortunate passing in 1975, that never came to be, obviously. But he did host two 1973-1974 pilots with In Search of Ancient Astronauts and In Search of Ancient Mysteries, and those too are included in this set. In 2002, a quickly forgotten In Search Of... revival hosted by Mitch Pileggi made the rounds on the Sci-Fi Channel and the USA Network, and quickly buried. Great news: all the 2002 episodes are also included, and if you enjoyed the History Channel's Ancient Aliens, you'll get to see, probably, one of the earliest TV appearances of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos (whose hairstyle was a lot less ridiculous than on Ancient Aliens).

You get seven volumes, each with three discs. The first six volumes are each season of the original series, then the last disc you get the 2002 series and the Rod Serling pilots.

I don't know what else I could add on, but what always drawn me to the series was the unusual subject matters covered, everything from Bigfoot to the Bermuda Triangle. UFOs, the paranormal, lake monsters, ancient civilizations, and so much more. With the obvious exception of the Rod Serling pilots, they tend to avoid mentioning Erich von Dniken (In Search of Ancient Astronauts was obviously based on von Dniken), although the occasional ancient astronaut theory does get brought up. I also really loved that trippy 1970s synthesizer music by Rinder & Lewis (who also recorded their share of disco albums, even a disco soundtrack album to In Search Of... in 1977). It's pretty obvious if you own an HDTV the picture quality is hardly digital high definition quality, and instead rather grainy. But since I grew up way before HDTV ever existed, that kind of picture quality was pretty normal for me. Then there's the 2002 series, where the picture quality is way better, given technology improved greatly since (HDTV was started to make inroads in 2002, but still a bit expensive for the average person). The creepy '70s synthesizer music was replaced by anonymous sounding techno, but I expected that. Here the series lasted for an hour and four different subject matters were covered. I found this one too rather enjoyable, although more graphic than the original series. As mentioned earlier, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos makes an appearance here, so does David Childress, so when the subject of aliens are covered, it's almost like you're watching a precursor to Ancient Aliens, due to the presence of Tsoukalos and Childress.

The set is not perfect. No mention of the original air dates are mentioned, nor bonus footage, like Leonard Nimoy describing the series and how it was made. But for those wondering if they'll get the A&E or History Channel introduction, you don't. You get the original introduction with the original music. The intros and music you've seen on A&E and the History Channel belonged to those channels. So it's nice to see these series the way they're supposed to be seen.

So obvious, if you've enjoyed In Search Of..., now is your chance to be able to watch these series whenever you want.",1372723200,,3784,4.763719512195122

5188424,4,B008X8VM1W,"The best word to describe this forever - in - waiting box set: FINALLY!!!

From the VERY creepy intro music by Rinder & Lewis, to the serious no nonsense style narration from Leonard Nimoy, and the great old school style way of telling stories by using photographs, drawings, paintings, and acting, every episode is accounted for. No lame CGI to deal with, no siree. Didn't exist back when the show was made, and to me the classic ways of telling a great mystery are done from the examples I just mentioned, because it leaves the viewer to use their imagination that much more.

This show scared the living hell out of me when I was a young kid. Many sleepless nights with images from episodes of this show just screaming in my brain as a young child. The Amityville episode (back when it was believable), Nostradamous, Michael Rockefeller, Jimmy Hoffa, The Death of Marilyn Monroe, The Mexican Pyramids, Jim Jones, Aliens, Deep Outer Space, The Dogon, Voodoo.....

All about missing people, strange civilizations, cults, haunted grounds, and things that go bump deep in the night. All with that terrorizing soundtrack. In Search Of showed viewers that everything in the world and solar system, past, present, and future, is not always sunshine and rainbows. No. Human beings, animals, weather, science, Mother Nature, the occult, and the universe as a whole are very disturbing enigmas that will never be fully understood.

The reson why I am giving a four star rating instead of five is because a documentary, booklet, or interviews with the masterminds behind this fantastic show would have been so rad. Even a recent interview with Leonard Nimoy just for this box set could have been awesome. However, hats off and a firm handshake to Visual Entertainment for making this stellar boxset. Thank you for your accomplishment from all the In Search Of hardcore fanbase.

To end my review, I am 38 years of age now. I have lived in two haunted houses in my life, heard voices coming from a pitch black room with no person inside, got lost in the forests of Maine during the night....and none of those things made me even flinch. But over 30 years later the Jim Jones episode where his face is slowly coming towards the camera when he is screaming his religious banter, honestly, still makes me look over my shoulder. Just like it did when I was 8 years of age.",1365984000,8,2359,4.7439024390243905

5188428,4,B008X8VM1W,"Of the DVDs we've watched so far, they all look pretty good. I was worried about the quality since these may not have been cleaned up. But on our 55"" TV they look fine. The shows are still great, except for a few which have been debunked and others warning of doom to come, like the Killer Bee Invasion, and I'd love to get the take from some people on the Global Ice Age to come. This is not why I subtracted a star either. So far we have watched many episodes in order, and the 2nd disc on Season 3 has problems. The Money Pit and Bermuda Triangle Pirates episodes will not play. They come on and freeze, and we can't even forward thru them. The Animal ESP show will not play at all, when we hit ""play"" it jumps to the Money Pit, which as I said, freezes up. This box set had each DVD sealed, and no scratches, so maybe the DVDs were not burned properly. Curious if others have had the same trouble.
Highly recommended for the paranormal/history/mysteries crowd, as these are much better than today's reality shows with 20somethings screaming at the wind or a creaky floor. Great look back at what was hot in the 70s, as in Kirlian photography, which was big then, but the fact that a power source was aimed at the objects was NOT advertised, and ""auras"" were the norm among people dropping acid. Overlooking some content errors, like the approach to North Carolina showing mountains and girls chanting Akhenaten's name while Tutankhamen's death mask flashes can be overlooked. This was 1970s paranormal TV at its best, and proved anything can sound eerie when random sounds from a Moog is played behind it. Who would have had a better narration voice that Leonard Nimoy anyway? One mystery to us: is the actor portraying John Wilkes Booth in the Lincoln episode a young Tom Hanks?

And one more thing--make sure to watch out for the planetary alignment in 1982, it is supposed to wreak worldwide havoc and even slow the earth's rotation, or maybe not.

5188436,4,B008X8VM1W,"Some people have commented that the picture quality for these DVDs is poor, personally I think the transfers look pretty good considering the show is over thirty-five years old. VEI didn't ignore this fact and it let's the viewer know at the beginning of each DVD with a text that reads ""This DVD contains technical anomalies that are inherent in historical footage"". (You can view a couple of still images I captured from the DVDs in the image section).

THE ORIGINAL SERIES:(22/23 minutes)
Their are some flaws, sometimes the contrast during the opening credits makes the white text look so bright that the letters kind of morph together, other times it looks sharp and clear. I did experience some problems with the discs, occasionally they freeze for about a second and at the end of one episode the Unviversal logo skipped and played a second time. Other problems include two episodes during season five, the first one being the end credits for ""Lee Harvey Oswald"" are of really poor quality compared to the rest of the episode, not sure what happen there. The other episode is ""The Lindbergh Kidnapping"", the audio and video are slightly out-of-synch for the entire episode. Stand-out episodes include ""Siberian Fireball"", ""The Money Pit Mystery"", ""D.B. Cooper"", ""The Lindbergh Kidnapping"", ""The Hindenburgh Mystery"" and ""The Elephant Man"".

2002 VERSION:(44 minutes)
As for season seven with Mitch Pileggi, it stinks. This updated version uses the Unsolved Mysteries approach by telling four stories for each episode. The music is awful and the show itself is just a depressing rehash that insults the viewer. No entertainment value here. While the original series used actual historical footage most of the time, this version uses poorly executed recreation segments. I don't think I'll be re-watching this season ever again.",1358553600,24,1833,5.147651006711409
5188437,5,B008X8VM1W,"Yeah I know some critics will say this show had (cracked couldn't get a job) writers thinking up ideas for the ISO series. Let me tell you, these supposed cracked writers were ahead of their time. Big Foot, Ghosts, Titanic, the Money Pit, UFOs etc, are very interesting topics that tv shows exhaustively emulate today, and have for the last twenty or so years. I watch the Titanic episode from 1981 and even though Titanic was not discovered yet, it was still a facinating watch. The remastering is fine with me, I believe they used betacam cameras in those days, as the quaility of the shows picture was never that good to begin with. So much for todays HD 1080p blu ray quality. Your not gonna get that in this dvd collection, but you will get one incredible revolutionary tv show, and best of all every episode. The soundtrack with all its weired synthesizer sounds would totally absorb me in to every episode. The shows soundtrack although simple, was very creative for its time, in my opinion it actually made ISO so much more memorable. Leornard Nimoy added his seriousness of Mr. Spock to make an incredible tv host. I mean face it all you critics, ISO is an amazing well put together tv show. I would watch this show during its original airing and be totally drawn in with interest. I mean come on critics, there was no internet to find all this information the ISO series supplied you with from 1976-1981. A simpler time, a simple tv show, ISO was the only way besides a library to find information about these odd subjects discussed on the show at the time of its airing. ISO was way ahead of its time. I'm glad it has been released with every episode intact. I love having the whole series and enjoy going back and watching an episode over again. the Reincarnation episode is one of my all time favorite episodes.

I love the set, the packaging and the inclusion of all three iterations of the series.  For those expecting Blu-Ray quality, they are likely not old enough to remember that the vintage programs look exactly like they did (or even a bit better) than they did in the 70s and early 80s...my surmise is that these programs were originally very not high budget affairs so they are not going to be up to the visual standards of a theatrical release of the same period.  These include the original opens and closes and I agree that anything else would have been a deal killer for me.

My only disappointment is that I would have liked some interviews with Nimoy and the behind the scenes crew from the original but very few things are perfect in life.

I'm not sure if some Amazon customers need their eyes checked but this set isn't ""mastered from old video tapes"" and the quality is pretty consistent. Remember this is a 1970s TV series shot on 16mm and syndicated to local stations. It's never going to look ""pristine."" As it is, I'm scratching my head at some of the comments people have posted: ""as good as Youtube"" and comparing it to the bootlegs sold on other websites for years? SERIOUSLY? What are you people watching? Outside of the Serling shows, these episodes could never look better than they do here, and they were all licensed from Universal and taken from their own vaults. Not only that, but they're also uncut and include the full opening/end credits with the original theme music. For the 144 (!) episodes, I don't think you could ask for much more -- and really, what extras are they going to include? It would take forever to historically update each and every episode.

5188443,3,B008X8VM1W,"I would only caution the potential buyer that the In Search Of set is somewhat disappointing in terms of the quality of the transfer.  Varies from episode to episode.  All are mastered for DVD from a series of videotapes provided by NBC and the quality isn't all that great.  Especially the two voiced by Serling: In Search of Ancient Mysteries and In Search of Ancient Astronauts.  Both of those, which are included on the last disc, are the exact same quality you see on YouTube ... bad.

In general, some old videotapes were used to transfer these, instead of film negative.  As a direct result, they vary.  For example, some of the episodes from the initial season are acceptable, while some from season five look really, really bad.  I would wait for the price to come down to around $50 before I buy it, that's about all it's worth, even with 21 discs included.  I paid around $90 and the only reason I'm not sending it back is because I love the show so much.

I would give 5 stars for the episodes, 4 for the packaging, and 2 for the transfers - which as I've stated, simply aren't very good.

HOWEVER, if you are a fan of the show, this may be the only chance you get to obtain a watchable full version, unless you prefer to watch it on YouTube.

I loved this show as a kid and for some reason the synth score would creep me out, not sure why.

Extras include two of Alan Landsberg's other movies (pre-In Search Of I believe) and the Mitch Pileggi episodes from the early 2000s.

If you liked the show as a kid, I highly recommend picking this up. It's one of my all-time favorites and I'm very, very glad to have it on DVD now.",1355961600,15,646,4.322314049586777
5188445,3,B008X8VM1W,"I know there is a lot of enthusiasm out there for this set, and I share a great deal of it, but I can't help but walk away a little disappointed at the end result.

To be sure, it's wonderful to have the entire In Search Of... series on DVD at last.  As someone who's avidly watched the website TVShowsonDVD.com and the IMDB for possible release information, it's been a long and winding road to get it to this point.  And as a person who was fascinated by this stuff as a kid I'm very grateful that I could purchase it at all.  While many of these mysteries have since been solved, or debunked, there's a wonderful 70's feel to the material that simply cannot be beat.  The overall packaging is solid and the disc cases are robust.

However, the reason I marked the series down to three stars is that I feel these DVD's represent a pretty minimal effort for a series that deserved better.  Sadly, this will almost surely be the only attempt to release this series on DVD.

The video quality is good, but appears to be no better than old re-broadcasts of existing VHS-quality stock.  It appears that no effort was made to obtain the original (almost certainly 16mm) prints, but realistically there probably wasn't much of a budget for this transfer in the first place. But that's not why I rated this three stars. Instead, it's the lack of any of the promised special features and Closed Captions/Subtitles for the hearing impaired that made me feel less than enthusiastic about the end product.

When this set was first announced, VEI claimed that they were going to attempt to create a documentary with Leonard Nimoy himself.  Unfortunately, it's clear that that did not come to pass.  In fact, there are no documentaries of any kind nor are there even liner notes that provide background on the making of the series.  Nothing.  The ""bonus"" features are simply the Mitch Pileggi and Rod Serling side segments presented in their original format.  As a long-time fan, I very much wanted to see something, anything, that let Mr. Nimoy explain what it was like to work on the series.  Now that Mr. Nimoy has effectively withdrawn from acting and public appearances, an interview would have been so valuable, especially since we have so precious little time left with him.  Even if such an interview is impossible, I find it remarkable that VEI couldn't be bothered to produce even liner notes that discuss what has happened to many of these mysteries in the almost forty years since the series was first produced.  (For example, much more is known about Carlos the Jackal, the Titanic, The Amityville Horror (confirmed as a hoax), etc.)

As I also noted, there was no attempt to put closed captioning or subtitles in this release.  Since I bought the Canadian version to save a few bucks (shame on me), but also assuming it's the same version as was released in the U.S., you'd think they'd at least have required French subtitles for the Quebecois, but nope.  They didn't even attempt to obtain the closed captions that must surely have been produced for A&E  when they prepared it for broadcast.  The lack of effort just tells me that either VEI rushed the product to market on a shoestring budget, or they simply didn't care to make the effort.

I'm sure others won't be bothered by these omissions, and I know I'll continue to enjoy watching the series anyway, but even though I LOVE the show I can't rate this DVD set as five stars because so much was left out of the final product.  It's a great time capsule with content that has been presented unmolested, but it's a pretty bare-bones release in the end.

UPDATE:
For perfectionists like I can be (at times), I wanted to post an amended Episode list for the Mitch Pileggi episodes on Disc 7.  It's pretty obvious that VEI simply copy/pasted the lists from Wikipedia, because while their titles match Wiki exactly, they don't match the titles in the episodes themselves and the order is not the same as is on the jacket.  They also list only three stories per episode, rather than the four that actually exist.  Here are the actual Pileggi episodes and the order they appear on the discs (though I still don't know the actual order they aired in.)

DISC 1:
1 The Ghost in Mackey's Bar / Stigmata / The Haunted Hornet / Zombies
2 Catacomb Mummies / The Johnson Bigfoot Encounter / The Secret of Rennes-le-Chateau / Earthquake Predictions
3 Hell/ Vampires / The Tesla Death Ray / Scandinavian Lake Monsters
4 Haunted Plantations / The Doomsday Virus / The Devil / Psychic Spies

DISC 2:
5 Werewolves / The Mummy's Curse / D.B. Cooper's Deathbed Confession / Reincarnation
6 Witchcraft / The Maneaters of Tsavo / The Alien Menace / Ghost Hitchers
7 Ghost Lovers / Possession and Exorcism / Robot Armageddon / The Haunted Campus
8 Faith Healers / The Real Frankenstein / The Shroud of Turin / Alien Ancestors

Footnote:
I'm really not often this picky (honest!) but like others I've waited for years, and years, and years for this set.  I'm just disappointed that VEI didn't take the time or the effort to give this series the treatment it deserved.  (Of course ""...it deserved"" is a subjective point of view, irrespective of how much said treatment would ultimately have cost to produce ;)  I just wish there was enough demand out there to get a stellar version, complete with new scans and cleanups of the old masters, a full subtitle treatment, and a documentary.  Alas, the show was probably never popular enough to warrant it.  (To reiterate, though, most of this is stuff that I have ignored in rating the DVD, since I know that what I want probably wasn't realistic.)",1355875200,101,5630,4.650505050505051

5188447,5,B008X8VM1W,"Before television shows like Ancient Aliens, Monsterquest or Finding Bigfoot, there was ""In Search of"". And what an awesome show it was. In the 1970's there was nothing else like it on television. I remember as kid, being glued to the television set, as Leonard Nimoy would come on and introduce the mystery that the show would be exploring. Those half hour episodes would either fasinate you or scare the crap out of you. It was been a long time but the original series is finally available. These are the uncut episodes like they first came on in the 1970's and 1980's. I can't believe it took this long to finally come out on DVD. There are also two original ""Alan Landsburg"" movies included, In Search of Ancient Astronauts' and In Search of Ancient Mysteries"", that came out before the show. Landsburg's other two movies ""The Outer Space Connection"" and ""Man-beast! Myth or Monster"" didn't make the cut. Segments of Man-beast! were used in the ""Monster Hunters"" and ""Yeti"" episodes. Oh well, at least the series in available with twenty one DVD's (145 episodes) to enjoy for during the holidays.",1355788800,9,1100,4.794736842105263

When a selection is made, it begins to play, then makes the loud 'whirring' noise again for several moments, then skips several chapter stops and plays normally.

Very glad this has finally seen a release, I just hope there are no quality issues....

I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for this series to come to DVD but the wait was definitely worth it. Received my order double boxed, well protected, and in perfect condition. The boxed set itself came shrink wrapped and in a sturdy case. I was even more pleased to find each DVD case was shrink wrapped also. Then the trip down memory lane began. Spent the first day watching the first 3 DVD's and the quality was awesome. So, so glad that this boxed set is absolutely the original version from the 70's (opening, closing, and everything in between) and not the cut up A & E version. Can't wait to watch the rest of the series. Thank you VEI and thank you Amazon!!!",1355702400,14,762,4.373239436619718
5188450,5,B008X8VM1W,"Hats off to VEI for making this possible.  I have just received my set today and have watched a few episodes.  Show looks great.  One must keep in mind these were transferred from tapes so you won't have the sharpness of a show transferred from film.  These are the original 70's version.  Refer to VEI's review for technical aspects of the transfer.  These must have been transferred from possibly Analog Betamax to Digital Batacam at some point.  Digital Betamax came out in the early 90's.  It looks like VEI did the best with the tapes that Universal provided them.  The box reads ""Copyright 2012 Universal Studios"", ""Distributed by Visual Entertainment Inc., Toronto Ontario"", ""Made in Canada"".  Individual Seasons state ""Made in U.S.A.""  The packaging is of quality.  It contains 7 standard DVD size season cases protecting 3 discs each.  Thanks to VEI for a job well done.",1355702400,8,879,4.8979591836734695

8531658,4,B008X8VM1W,"What a fantastic and entertaining series! As a child, I grew up watching this show. In fact, until I was a teenager, I thought Leonard Nimoy was the ""In Search of"" guy.
Great subject material, eerie and engaging background music (the original, by the way, not the redux by History Channel). Some of the conjecture presented rings true. On the other hand, the subject material is somewhat overstated, exaggerated or blown out of proportion (it is a documentary series, what else should we expect?). It's less sensationalistic than what passes for documentaries on cable, but more dramatic.
Also, either the disks or the source material has a few serious flaws making the DVD presentation somewhat underwhelming.

Content is very interesting and informative. As other reviews have stated, this was aired in the late 70's early 80's. Being a collector of early television, this is absolutely perfect!!
I wish I would've known about this as a kid!! Lots of historical, and scientific information. Highly recommend for older and intelligent children, who yearn for something more then what they get in school. Family friendly (kids over 9), not before bed, but rainy, or snowy afternoons while your coloring or baking cookies! :)
This set has the feel of 70's, along side with the selected music. So far, entertaining, interesting, and informative, and historical!!
 They should re air these!!
**UPDATE**Unfortunately a few of these great shows, are freezing up, or don't play, I am thinking of returning or exchanging..it seems some other people had this same experience with these DVDs, it's too bad cuz these are some great historical information! :(
Still a five star show..",1511222400,4,1113,4.920212765957447
