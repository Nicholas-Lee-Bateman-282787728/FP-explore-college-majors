5277379,5,B0098465QW,"Today, as I write this, is December 23, 2012, and we are still alive. If you recall, the end of days was supposed to have been two days ago, on December 21. Happily, that didn't happen - for now --, but the entertainment world keeps busy doing films about the destruction of life as we know it. Nothing wrong with that, I guess, but it is really good when a film with doomsday themes that make you think comes along - an intelligent and plausible one, that is. ""Doomsday Book"" is such a movie. It is fascinating and overpowering, with many possibilities to ponder.

""Doomsday Book"" is really three films into one, helmed by two different Korean directors. The first segment, ""Brave New World,"" directed by Yim Pil-Sung, hits you in the gut, and you should see it a couple hours after having dinner, as it deals with the effect of an epidemic a la ""Mad Cow disease,"" when people become zombie-like creatures after eating infected beef. We meet a young man on a date with an attractive young lady, and how, after eating in an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue, they get sicker and sicker. It follows the epidemic from the slaughterhouse all the way to the media frenzy created by it. And it is the media frenzy, I think, that steals the show, as it might remind you of the current state of the art of our media sensationalism. The second segment, ""The Heavenly Creature,"" helmed by Kim-Ji-woon, is, in short, a masterpiece, one of the smartest films - despite its length - I have ever seen. It's about a robot that is member of a Buddhist monastery. He is the only non-human within all the humans. However, one day the repairman is contacted, because the lead monk believes that the robot is not well; apparently, it is claiming to be Buddha. The repairman can't find anything wrong with the robot, and the owner of the company, as well as his henchmen, arrive to the location, ordering the destruction of the robot as well as others of the same series, because it has become too intelligent and, thereby, a threat. The owner of the company asks, in regards to the robot, ""Who could have known its greatest gift would become its mortal affliction? A robot must never construe or trespass on the domains of man."" And there are, of course, philosophical answers to these arguments, which are explored in this awesome segment. The last part of the movie, under the direction of Yim Pil-Sung, and called ""Happy Birthday,"" is about a meteor that will hit earth in a few hours, and the frenzy that it generates. The meteor is shaped as a number eight billiard ball, which coincides with a ball that a little girl lost from her uncle earlier in the film. Years later, while being in an underground shelter waiting for the meteor's impact, we find out the meaning of it all. Again, the director explores, in a hilarious way, the media frenzy over this event.

""Doomsday Book"" gives us three stories or point of views about the future, at least two of them possible, and the other, with some imagination, might also be possible. It is intelligent filmmaking, not from Hollywood, but from South Korea. (South Korea, 2012, color, 114 min).

5277380,4,B0098465QW,"South Korean director Kim Jee-woon (""A Bittersweet Life,"" ""The Good The Bad The Weird,"" ""I Saw the Devil"") was where most of the interest resided when it came to the anthology film ""Doomsday Book."" Fellow South Korean director Yim Pil-sung (""Antarctic Journal"", ""Hansel & Gretel"") has a larger contribution to the film, but his work hasn't been nearly as satisfying. The two directors collaborate on an anthology that covers a rage infested pandemic, artificial intelligence becoming something more, and a meteor collision that could mean the destruction of the entire planet.

""A Brave New World"" is directed by Yim Pil-sung. Seok-woo (Ryu Seung-beom) is left alone at home while his parents and sister go on vacation. Left with the responsibility of cleaning an otherwise disgusting apartment on his own, Seok-woo does what is asked of him but unknowingly triggers a contagious virus. The trash that is sorted and fed to cows sparks a type of mad cow disease, which in turn is fed back to the people who get sick with symptoms that include emotional outbursts, slow stumbling, and a thirst for blood.

""The Heavenly Creature"" is directed by Kim Jee-woon. A robot (voiced by Park Hae-il) residing in a monastery has achieved a level of Buddhism the human Monks have yet to achieve. A technician named Park Do-won (Kim Kang-woo) is called out to see if the robot is defective. The story touches on how the human race might react if robots began acting more human than the human race itself.

""Happy Birthday"" is also directed by Yim Pil-sung. A young girl named Min-seo (Jin Ji-hee) breaks the 8-Ball of her father's pool set. In a race to try and replace it before her parents and uncle find out, Min-seo tries to order the ball online. She orders it from an unusual website and two years later, a meteor is set to collide with the Earth in a matter of hours. Pictures begin to trickle in of the meteor as Min-seo and her family hide out in a bomb shelter, which leads her to believe she alone may have inadvertently destroyed the entire world.

This sci-fi anthology probably isn't what you'd imagine a film like this to be since most films revolving around the end of the world are fast paced, action packed, and/or just overloaded with special effects. ""Doomsday Book"" is a different approach as it attempts to be smarter than the average bear and tries to tickle the intriguing crevices of the left side of your brain. ""A Brave New World"" is heavily influenced by the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden in particular. Notice how often the story returns to the apple. Calling these poor souls ""zombies"" once they're infected seems unfair. They're not undead since they never died and are more similar to the rage infected victims in ""28 Days Later"" and ""28 Weeks Later."" ""The Heavenly Creature"" will immediately draw comparisons to ""I, Robot"" and is probably the story you're looking forward to since most publicity regarding the film is directed here. But the ""I, Robot"" comparisons aren't accurate. The similarities are certainly there, but the Buddhism aspect takes the story in a different direction. The line between right and wrong is completely blurred and the story resembles ""Blade Runner"" more than anything by the time it's over. ""Happy Birthday"" is a bit strange, but the emotional performances and the way Min-seo's parents aren't easily persuaded add a bit of human nature to an otherwise silly premise.

""Doomsday Book"" isn't a bad film, but it isn't going to appeal to everyone. It strives to make you think and contemplate the current state, future, and what goes into actually defining just what a person can be or actually is when it comes to humanity rather than being straightforward and flat out entertainment that you may be used to. The performances are very strong (however Jin Ji-hee does a more convincing job as Min-seo than Bae Doona does) and the film looks spectacular on Blu-ray. You have to respect the fact that ""Doomsday Book"" never falters from the messages it chooses to portray, but some will be aching for something more exciting by the time everything fades to black for the final time. The biggest complaint is that there really isn't anything that connects these three stories other than being ""three visions of the future,"" which is something more well-known film analogies of the past have always done successfully. However, it's still fascinating enough to be worth your time.",1355270400,,4435,4.853368560105681
5277381,4,B0098465QW,"""Doomsday Book"" is based on three apocalyptic world-ending stories that have been used many times but this film uses them very well. The film definitely has its merits and is very entertaining at times. Be warned: the story about the zombies is a little bit gross and I am not talking about gore either. There are a few cheesy and campy moments in the film that keep it from a 5 star rating and that keep it from placing itself among the upper tier of South Korean Cinema like ""Old Boy"", ""Memories of Murder"", ""Secret Sunshine"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""The Host"", ""Mother"", ""Howling"", ""Thirst"", ""The Isle"", ""Bedevilled"", ""Phone"", ""Helpless"", ""Deranged"", ""Samaritan Girl"", ""Blind"", ""Haunters"", ""Heartbeat"", ""Hindsight"", ""The Way Home"", ""The Quiet Family"", ""3-Iron"", ""Natural City"", ""I am a Dad"" and others. But, don't let that discourage you from buying this very entertaining film. Highly recommended!!!",1355184000,2,905,5.163265306122449
5277382,5,B0098465QW,"Zombies, robots and asteroids out of control! Yes, you've seen similar flicks on these subjects, but not covered in the fashion of ""Doomsday Book""! The three vignettes in this film are markedly different, but each seems to flow seemlessly into the next, as we wonder how the world might end in each episode.

Perhaps the most enticing and maybe frightening is the innocuously-entitled ""Happy Birthday,"" where a little girl calls up an alien website (they exist, don't they?) and accidentally ends up ordering, perhaps, the end of our planet!

A fascinating exploration into what might just happen in the near future; I recommend ""Doomsday Book"" to all adult audiences.",1354665600,14,668,5.1192660550458715
5277383,2,B0098465QW,"there are a few different stories on this Disc, from zombies to just strange end of the world stories to robots with a soul movie.

the movies are each very short, There is no real meaning, no action, no strong gripping Drama, not amazing acting.
it's even awkward at times  and mostly seems like a waste of time.

if you think of a cool futuristic looking movie, do not watch this, this movie has nothing going for it.
the cover looks cool, but the robot is in only one short clip, and the rest if very boring.",1371254400,2,511,4.247422680412371
5277384,4,B0098465QW,"Horror/Sci-Fi anthologies have always been a mixed bag. There are always some segments that succeed while others suck out loud. This is as consistent in its offerings as any I've seen.

Here's the scoop. In the first segment two twenty somethings are on the verge of a relationship when, at a restaurant, they eat some tainted meat (as do other patrons) and hey begin to zombie-fy. The thing going here is watching as the disease spreads and becomes an epidemic. This is all handled really well. I's shot and acted well and moves as smooth as silk. The only problem is it doesn't really end. It merely stops. They couldn't figure out an ending so they concoct this Adam and Eve scenario that just seems tacked on.

In the second segment a Buddhist monastery calls a service man because one of their droids appears to have obtained consciousness. He agrees and must file a report to have said droid terminated. The CEO of the firm pays a visit and agrees. The thing happening here is the question of consciousness. If a machine becomes self aware, is it still a machine? The dynamic present in this segment is really good. The arguments on both sides are good. It might be an unanswerable question. I liked the ending but the post script confused me a bit. This is the best of the three. The droid is well designed. It looks a bit like the droids in ""I Robot.""

In the third segment a young girl has somehow scarred the 8 ball in her father's billiard set. She goes on line to replace it and inadvertently sets up the possible destruction of planet Earth. Her mom, dad and uncle build a shelter to survive the oncoming catastrophe. The thing happening here is the family dynamic where the daughter is the center of things. You see them as they try to put the pieces of the asteroid puzzle together and figure out it if they can thwart extinction. This is odd in that they find humor in an end of the world crisis. It's a good exercise in black humor.

All in all this is a good watch. I've seen a strong handful of really good Korean flicks. This might not be the best of the bunch but it's well worth the time taken to watch it.",1371168000,,2128,4.407124681933842
5277385,5,B0098465QW,These were three different and unrelated tales from visionary Korean directors. The first one is a new spin on the old zombie take-over genre. The second - and my personal favorite - was about a Buddhist android. And the final one was a new take on the apocalypse wave. A must-have for any sci-fi collection!,1369872000,,308,4.618181818181818
5277386,3,B0098465QW,"Pretty disappointed, just so-so at best... kind of like three poor Outer Limits episodes, but from from Korea. If it was on T.V., I would have changed the channel.",1368489600,,163,4.655172413793103
5277387,5,B0098465QW,"This film is in Korean with English subtitles. It defaults to no subtitles. The DVD lacks any commentary, which I would have watched on this particular film.

This production consists of three sharp stories, the first being my favorite.

The first feature smartly utilizes the story of the apple in the garden of Eden as a metaphor for Pandora's box. A rotten apple finds its way into the food chain as cow meal. Humans consume meat from the cow and get a ""mad cow's disease"" which causes them to act like zombies. The film claims it is a virus, but clearly it is prions. Oprah was right! I loved this zombie explanation.

The second feature is about a robot who develops his own conscientiousness and is proclaimed to be Buddha due to his enlightenment. This segment contains heavy speeches concerning how man has become slaves to his inventions to the point that they impact on his evolution.

The third segment concerns a young girl who orders an eight ball on line only to find out it is being delivered from outer space in the form of a huge meteor that will destroy the planet.

I love colorful Asian cinematography. This one has adopted an appropriate western sound track which gave it the feel of a Hollywood production. The characters were well done. The movie oozes with comedy and satire as well as philosophy. This is without a doubt one of the best ""end of the world"" films that have come out here of late.

5277388,3,B0098465QW,"I had high expectations after reading some of the reviews for this product. Once I bought it and watched it, ehhh, it wasn't that great,but not bad either-somewhere in the middle. I felt like something was missing:more to the story, more character depth, more follow up after the events...For me it's watchable, but not amazing.",1365379200,,328,4.9818181818181815
5277389,5,B0098465QW,"Doomsday Book is an apocalyptic-themed anthology. ""A Brave New World"" focuses on a mysterious virus that causes a zombie outbreak; in ""The Heavenly Creature"" a robot is seen as a threat to mankind after it attains the highest form of enlightenment; in ""Happy Birthday"" a little girl purchases a pool ball from a strange website, and, 2 years later, a large meteor is set to collide directly with Earth. Doomsday Book is an excellent apocalyptic anthology of SciFi, horror, and comedy.

I enjoyed every story in this anthology. ""A Brave New World"" is a horror-comedy zombie story, ""The Heavenly Creature"" plays like a SciFi-Drama that speaks more about society, while ""Happy Birthday"" feels like a straightforward apocalyptic-comedy. All of these stories are interesting, fairly paced, and, best of all, highly entertaining. All of the genre elements this film utilizes feel fresh and distinct, and they work (i.e. the comedy is genuinely funny, the concepts can be frightening, etc.) The film is shot beatifully, and the special effects are great; definitely a film worth watching on Blu-Ray or in HD. The acting was spectacular throughout the entire film. I also enjoyed the music in all of the short films.

Overall, Doomsday Book is a highly entertaining anthology with variety, great acting, and superb direction. Another gem from South Korea. As of 3/14/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is highly recommended.

Doomsday Book has strong violence and blood. (including some brief animal violence)",1363219200,2,1535,5.2317073170731705
5277390,3,B0098465QW,"the other stories were so so... the robot one was the best, enlightening and thought provoking, showing the fear and apprehension that we human have for other ""creatures"" that are superior to us.",1363046400,,195,4.9393939393939394
5277391,5,B0098465QW,"When I rented this I thought it was one film about zombies and robots, which looked cool enough, but it is actually three short films by two directors with some amazing special effects, definitely worth the watch. It is all subtitled, something I didn't note upon renting, not that I mind, but I know some do.

In the first story, we have the beginning of a zombie outbreak shown from the point of view from one young man as he bids his family farewell for their vacation. Over the next three days, life goes on as normal, he cleans, dates, hangs out with friends; but then one unexpected bite from dinner makes him patient zero for the zombie outbreak and all hell breaks loose. We continue to watch as he inadvertently spreads his disease, and as others from the restaurant become infected as well. It is the beginning of the end, but he struggles to hold on to his humanity all the same, and that is what makes this story sweet. That along with it's ending.

Next up is the story of a humanoid robot who claims to be Buddha, so convincing is he that all the monks in the temple believe it to be true as well. A robot technician is called upon to decide if this robot is in need of repair, which his scans show he is not, or if he really has found enlightenment, which the technician refuses to believe. While his equipment shows the robot functions as it should, the technician determines he must be broken to claim it has found religion, and tells the monks in the temple he must file his report accordingly, that it is out of his hands; meaning they will surely destroy the robot. This is also a very interesting short film as it really makes you think, especially about what it is to be human, to think, to create and about religion and spirituality. This story seems pulled right out of one of Bradbury's books, very in line with his thinking. The end was also very, very great.

The last short is about a little girl and her family, mom, dad and uncle, moving into a bomb shelter as  something huge and ball shaped plummets towards the Earth at such a speed it will blaze the surface and kill anyone unprotected. This story also seems an homage to the Twilight Zone itself, the story so out there and outside the box you're almost laughing but appreciating the possibility of it all.

All three stories were amazing and when I rented it, I really expected a B rated movie, so I was more than just a little pleasantly surprised. I was blown away! Highly recommended!",1360972800,2,2473,4.426373626373627
5277392,5,B0098465QW,"While browsing in the Blockbuster, I stumbled upon the cover of the DVD to which stirred my curiosity. The title ""The Doomsday Book"" in itself is interesting enough for me to even pick it up. I looked to the back and noticed that it is a three-part story about the human self-destruction in the modern high-tech era. Naturally, I rented it and went on home to watch it.

Indeed, there are three stories of the possible ""futures"":

""A Brave New World"" is basically about the flesh-eating zombies, yeah really. Apparently, one single apple is rotten and made its way down to the food chain and recycled for the cows to feed on. Then, that made it way to the food for the people to consume. The main character was first to eat it and became infested, turning into a zombie. Pretty soon, that virus spread around and the rest of the population become zombies.

""The Heavenly Creature"" is about a robot who has achieved enlightenment. It was living in a Buddhist monastery and a repair technician came to look at it and became convinced that it is ""defective"" and that it must be destroyed. Then, the chairman of the UR company, along with his extermination team, came to shut down the robot. Needless to say, they were in for a surprise. I personally felt that this story is interesting because of the possibility of robots becoming more human than the human beings themselves. This actually reminded me of the American film, ""I, Robot.""

""Happy Birthday"" is actually a bizarre story, in my opinion, about the country being threatened by an asteroid that is remarkably a giant version of the 8 Ball. An 8 Ball that a little girl ordered online to replace her father's damaged ball two years earlier. This is a pretty funny part because of the reactions the people were having on the televisions to the approaching Giant 8 Ball. That same little girl tried to cancel the order via the ""alien"" website in order to stop the ""delivery."" The surreality of this story is just amazing.

So, the overall film ain't so bad. I really do admired its originality and I've found it quite a fascinating watch.",1359158400,,2091,4.640540540540541

The first story is about a geek who goes on a date with a girl and eat infected food which turns then (and others) into zombies, whereupon Seoul goes down the drain. Ironically it is because of an infected fruit he put in recycling, which in turn was put in cattle feed, which in turn was served as food. (a humorous note: North Korea is blamed for the ""biological weapon"") The second story is more philosophical in nature as a robot with AI doing chores in a Buddhist monastery adopts the religion and becomes Buddha.

The mindless talking heads of Korean news get roasted here and reassures me that America doesn't have a monopoly on stupid journalists---I loved it!

The beginning tale is a pretty standard but quirky bit of zombie trouble. The recent zombie craze is nearly as overplayed as the ""Twilight""-influenced vampire obsession has been. New idea time, please.

The middle story is set in the future and tells of a robot whose malfunction is achieving total consciousness. Sandwiched in between a bit about zombies and an object colliding with Earth, it's a heady, ambitious piece with a confusing ending. It looks beautiful, though.

The closer is about a little girl who orders an eight-ball from a website and seals the fate of humanity. It's weird, but I liked it more than the other stories.
