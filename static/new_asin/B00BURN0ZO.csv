5675947,5,B00BURN0ZO,"Love the GB version of L&O--its fantastic even as like the original, characters leave and or get killed off and are replaced by new characters you like just as much. But the first 4 seasons in region 1 had subtitles and seasons 5,6,& 7 in region 2 do not. So the show with subtitles for me is a '10' but without is a 2 because it was just too much effort to understand what was being said. If your ears to a British accent are better than mine--great--enjoy the show.",1391299200,3,467,4.2
5675948,5,B00BURN0ZO,"Firstly, please note that these are Region 2 DVDs (European) which will only play on a Region 2 DVD player or a Region Free DVD player.  They have not yet been issued in Region 1 (North American) format.

Law and Order UK was initially commissioned for just one season of 13 episodes in 2009 which were Series 1 and 2 in the UK.  US Law and Order episodes were screened for stories which it was thought would translate well into a UK context.  However, this venture was so successful that we are now onto our seventh series, with series eight commissioned, for a total of over fifty episodes!

The format is the same as for all the Law and Order offshoots.  Initially we have a crime which is investigated and the second part of the show moves onto the court case.  This is not one of those shows where we learn a lot about the main players as individuals, and the stories concentrate on the crime, apprehension and subsequent legal proceedings.

This time round the stories with the US Law and Order episodes they are based on, which were screened between 1994 and 2005 are:

Tracks  (Locomotion)
Tremors  (Aftershock)
Paternal  (Deadbeat)
Fatherly Love  (Family Values)
Mortal  (Golden Years)
Dependant  (Phobia)

Series 7 and the yet to be screened Series 8 are Season 4 in the USA.  Clearly we can expect many more series of Law and Order UK.  However, my personal bugbear is that we have not had a single episode written for this show as they have all been lifted from previous US shows.  Hopefully this will change sometime soon!",1382140800,9,1535,4.597785977859779

8574175,4,B00BURN0ZO,You don't realize that you've seen these stories before not necessarily because of the different ways of police procedure but because the legal system is slightly different. The BBC has taken well written stories and given them to a cast and crew who know how to make a great show.,1424476800,,281,4.64
