The show is fun for adults - and especially children; and reviews are correct: this show is best to be seen. As always, the Choir never disappoints!",1468713600,,362,4.553846153846154

7269555,1,B00YZB1II8,"It is so sad that the choir saw fit to take Christ out of Christmas ! ! ! ! !  I think that there are more than enough shows for kids on TV !!!  What were they thinking ?  Also what ever happened to all the great songs they recorded in the 50's, 60's, & 70's ?  Older directors, great !  Newer directors, not so  much!",1453075200,,318,3.742424242424242
7269556,3,B00YZB1II8,"If you like the Muppets and have small children or are a small child, it's a fun show.  However, it is only marginally a CHRISTMAS show, which is how it was advertised..  My husband hated it.  If the MTC wants to do children's shows, that is fine, just make sure it is advertised as such.  If they are doing a Christmas show, it should have CHRISTMAS music, especially religious carols (they are a religious institution), to counteract all the ""Christmas"" shows that are only about Santa and selling the singers' latest albums.  I did enjoy watching, because I like the Muppets, but I was disappointed in the lack of real Christmas music.",1451692800,,638,4.660714285714286
7269557,5,B00YZB1II8,"I got this for my mother, and she loved this program.  I enjoyed it myself too.  The arrangement and performance of the Polish carol was incredibly beautiful.  The use of the sesame street characters was well done and entertaining.  Even as an adult I chuckled.  What a wonderful program.  This is an easy gift for anyone.",1451520000,,322,4.660714285714286

7269559,4,B00YZB1II8,"This is a fun Christmas concert that is great for children! The muppets are fun and add some Christmas cheer to the amazing Mormon Tabernacle Choir. It talks about Christmas cheer, gratitude, and kindness. I wish it talked more about the religious reason we celebrate Christmas, but it is still fun nonetheless.",1451347200,,311,5.0
7269560,5,B00YZB1II8,Great Christmas DVD. Who wouldn't love The Muppets and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!!,1451174400,,85,5.615384615384615
7269561,2,B00YZB1II8,"""Infant Holy, Infant Lowly"" saved this from a 1-star review. I was so disappointed that the only Christmas special I can count on to (a) actually celebrate Christmas and (b) cater to music-loving grownups, failed on both counts this year. Seeing the MTC Christmas special ""live"" is on my bucket list -- I kept thinking how disappointed I would have been, had this been the year I finally made the trek to see it! This year's concert was strictly for little kids; the usual appeal-to-all-ages cleverness of the Muppets was nowhere to be seen. They were simply tiresome and shrill, with the lamest writing I've seen them have, ever. And I'm sorry, ""Candyman,"" ""Who are the People in your Neighborhood,"" the theme from Sesame Street, and ""Sing, Sing a Song"" are not Christmas music. Sad.",1451001600,,784,4.814814814814815

7269563,1,B00YZB1II8,"Never thought I would say that about a Choir Christmas show.  We saw this production on PBS last night.
 Costumes -  the boys looked like a cross between 1930's newsboys & hotel bellboys;  the girls like something out of an old English music hall.
 Music - the Choir generally performs an offbeat selection of carols but at least throws in several more well-known traditional ones.  Not this time.
  The finale with ""Angels from the Realms of Glory"" was the only one.
 Guests - Fontana was excellent in voice & humor.  But if I'd wanted to see a Sesame St show I'd watch their own on PBS.  I thought it distracted  from the production.  I'm sure the kids liked it but it was too much Muppets too often.

Prior years' shows were excellent.  We especially enjoyed the one with Sissel, the Norwegian pop singer.  I'm not sure how long the live performances last.  Up until several years ago the PBS version lasted at least 90 minutes.  Now they are 60 mins.",1450742400,,954,4.511764705882353
7269564,3,B00YZB1II8,"Fine-my opinion too many chorus shots, but fits the bill with Christmas music. It's OK",1450569600,,86,4.8
7269565,4,B00YZB1II8,"A bit too long, and should have had more Muppets, but that's easier said than done.  Otherwise, it was fun.",1449792000,,107,4.35
7269566,5,B00YZB1II8,This is delightful. I have watched it 3 times so far with various family members and plan for more.,1449360000,,99,4.2631578947368425
7269567,3,B00YZB1II8,"Was very excited to share this with our kids. They LOVE it, but I'm with the others...it leaves something to be desired not being in HD. I thought that perhaps we had a bad copy, but after reading other reviews realize that is not the case. Too bad.

2 stars for the poor video quality...

7269571,5,B00YZB1II8,Couldn't wait for this to be released!  We had the opportunity to see the concert live in Salt Lake City.  This concert was for adults as well as for children.  What an experience!  It set the tone for our Christmas season.  I only wish the concerts were released on Blu-ray.,1447632000,2,275,4.42
7269572,5,B00YZB1II8,The only thing I didn't like was when the puppeteers came out with the puppets. I understand wanting to applaud the puppeteers but having the puppet with them where most only had half a body took some of the magic from the characters. But that was only about 30 seconds at the end. Other than that I absolutely loved it! Wish we could have been there!,1447372800,,351,4.333333333333333
7269573,5,B00YZB1II8,"From the opening song, Sing a Christmas Carol, to the final reminder to, Keep Christmas with you all through the year, this concert is pure Christmas magic. Along the way we learn, with the adorable Muppets, why Christmas is more than presents, lights, and Christmas cookies. Even Cookie Monster learns to share.

Everyone is in top formthe choir, orchestra, bells, organist (Richard Elliott), singers, and dancers. The Muppets are amusing and add fun and humor to the show. Santino Fontana is a charming host and a delightful and talented performer. Special kudos to the costumes and set decorations.

Although the concert is specifically geared for children, all ages will enjoy this visual and auditory Christmas feast. It is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and lighten your spirits! Highly recommended.",1447286400,3,813,5.151515151515151
7269574,5,B00YZB1II8,"So good! I don't even know where to begin. EVERYTHING was done so well! I love this DVD. My kids love this DVD. Instant classic, easily going to go down as one of the best holiday videos you watch every holiday season.",1447286400,,218,4.214285714285714

7269576,5,B00YZB1II8,This video is awesome!  My family and I love watching the Mormon Tabernacle Choir AND Sesame Street - combine them together and you have one amazing production.  We have already watched it twice and I know we will watch this over and over . . . and maybe not just at Christmas.,1446508800,2,277,4.3076923076923075
7269577,5,B00YZB1II8,"Year after year the annual Christmas Specials by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra on Temple Square surpass each previous one, and this most recent 2015 DVD presentation of Keep Christmas With You stands out as the most spectacular of them all. The picture quality is magnificent, and the sound does justice to the fabulous Choir and large orchestra, with brilliant underscoring by Mack Wilberg during many of the narrative sequences.

With its new format it is the most loveable sprinkling of Christmas Cheer that this old world needs more than ever today, and is reminiscent of those times when Christmas TV Specials with Perry Como, Pat Boone and Bing Crosby brought home the true meaning of Christmas.  This show is 92 minutes of sheer pleasure for kids from 2 to 92 with its guest stars, the loveable and funny Sesame Street Muppets and the radiant multi-talented singer Santino Fontana (from Broadways Cinderella and Disneys Frozen).

The audience of 21,000 in the gigantic awe-inspiring auditorium (in fact, this venue would have to be the largest concert hall in the world), plus the 360-voice Tabernacle Choir, the 102-piece Symphony Orchestra and the 200 Dancers and Bell Ringers is a spectacular feast for the eyes and the ears, and the children in the audience are mesmerised (as are the adults) with the dazzling staging of every single minute of this never-to-be-forgotten show.  Special mention must be made of the stunning costumes, dances and dancers, many of them just tiny tots who put their hearts and souls into every step.

In all of my 50 years as an International executive TV producer and director, Ive not seen such an entertaining and lavish TV Christmas production that even comes close to this one.  Everyone involved in its production must be congratulated.

The interaction between conductor Mack Wilberg and Big Bird is charming and even Big Bird gets to conduct the orchestra and choir.  But wait until Grover takes on the job as the TV director of the show, the laughs come think and fast.  The actual TV direction is outstanding by Lee Wessman, who once again takes us soaring above the audience right into close-ups of the Muppets with their hilarious chitchat and singing.  Theres a lot of heart and sensitivity in these little characters and its no wonder they have won the hearts of children and adults for some 46 years.  There are scenes too, with the Muppets working back stage, in the directing booth and they even cross to Elmo their Muppet roving reporter outside the venue amongst the magnificent Christmas lights on Temple Square.

Theres so much happening with an abundance of Christmas and Sesame Street songs sung by the Muppets, Santino and the Choir, its impossible to mention them all here, but Santinos Wonder of Winter medley will bring back a lot of childhood memories for those who grew up during the 1940s and 50s with Christmas songs that everyone could actually sing and hum back then.  As well as the traditional carols theres also the Classical Interlude with the full orchestra and choir and the music of Tchaikovsky, Bach and Rossini.

Another of the many highlights is Richard Elliotts sensational virtuoso pipe organ solo.  And this time its The Twelve Days of Christmas interwoven with familiar melodies depicting each of the 12 days. The always-counting Count Von Count gives his vampirian commentary sitting on top of the console, counting from 1 to 12, and that is truly hilarious.  Its an outstanding show-stopper that will have you wanting the Count to keep on counting!

The DVD is anamorphic 16:9 widescreen and the quality of the vision is excellent - sharp and colorful!  The audio is in 5.1 Surround and Stereo.  All in all, this is a magnificent and impressive Christmas Special that everyone should own  a program that will remain in your hearts for many Christmases to come.

And if thats not all, the DVD also contains an extra 30+ minutes bonus, Backstage, with an informal interview with Santino Fontana, and a detailed insight into the workings of the Muppets with their actual puppeteers. Youll be surprised to see how they made this show come together.  And last but not least, Backstage with Count Von Count and conductor Ryan Murphy will certainly melt anyones frozen funny bone.  Do yourself a favour and 'Keep Christmas With You' on DVD!",1446508800,11,4335,4.924450549450549

7269580,5,B00YZB1II8,What a delightful concert!  There were some special moments for the children in the audience and the child in all of us.  Santino Fontana is so talented in not only voice but presence and humor as well.  How fun to see the Sesame Street characters interact with different people in the show.  The music was breathtakingly gorgeous at times and laugh out loud funny at others. The organ piece was amazing!  All around extremely well done.  BRAVO!!,1445299200,3,446,4.7272727272727275
7269581,5,B00YZB1II8,"We were able to attend this concert and loved it.  It was enjoyable for both adults and children.  We couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so we could send copies to our family and friends.  This CD is as enjoyable as seeing it live.  The shots of audience members reactions, both young and old, add to the enjoyment.  It will definitely be a memorable Christmas gift.",1445212800,3,369,4.367647058823529
7269582,5,B00YZB1II8,"Santino Fontana is simply masterful, wonderful, a spark plug of happiness in this stunning video.  He wasn't merely a guest artist, but also seemed to be stage hostand he shined in that role also.  There is no trace of pretense in his stage presence; he just delights in all he says and does.

The muppet cast created waves of laughter and smiles.  They seemed to interact with nearly everyone  Choir directors Mack Wilberg and Ryan Murphy, organist Richard Elliot, a Tabernacle Choir member, the dancing ballet kids, etc.  I am so amazed at the Muppets' subtle nuance movements and mannerisms, and their voices just captured my heart.

There is one aspect of let-down.  This show deserves a High Definition 1080p Blu ray release. I know that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir produces on its own label, and so they must grapple with monetary issues. Nevertheless it's disheartening to see this appear without the blue case. The Choir has produced two of its Christmas specials on Blu ray in the past, and has elected not to nowI'm sure for a reason. But DVD is old technology; the discs have a short lifespan in years before they begin to deteriorate. And as one's eyes become 'educated' to high definition, a lesser picture seems like a let-down.",1444867200,,1242,4.7981220657277
7269583,5,B00YZB1II8,Loved this concert! I was at this concert and it was amazing! I don't have any kids and still thought it was one of the best Christmas concerts I have seen with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. My husband also enjoyed it.  I ordered a DVD for myself and also one for my mom to share with my nieces. Highly recommend!,1444694400,5,312,4.2
7269584,5,B00YZB1II8,"This one tops them all!  I remember when I first saw ""Mary Poppins: The Musical"" and I thought it was pure magic when she flew over the audience at the end.  This concert has that same kind of magic, except it's there every single moment of the show.  It is breathtakingly wonderful, charming, ingenious, heartwarming, and completely lovable.  Muppets and MoTabs are a perfect match.  Santino Fontana sings like a dream, and is the perfect host/friend/MC to make this show flow seamlessly.  This is already a treasured classic in our house, and we only got it today.",1444435200,5,566,4.783505154639175
7269585,5,B00YZB1II8,"One of, if not the best, Christmas concerts ever! This includes not just the Tabernacle Choir or Sesame Street, but I mean ever.  It is absolutely dripping with charm and cuteness! We're having our 1st graders watch it this year as a special reward at my elementary school! Its theme is the characters of Sesame Street meeting people in the choir and orchestra and finding out what they do, how hard they work, and that Christmas is more than just cookies (Cookie Monster would disagree :) ), or lights, or presents. I doubt it can be topped in terms of creativity or musicality, and that is in due in large part to Mack Wilberg, the choir's conductor. Do yourself a favor and buy this thing! I think it's one of those gems that will become a Christmas tradition for families to watch year after year.",1444348800,8,801,4.524137931034483
7269586,5,B00YZB1II8,Was in Salt Lake and saw the live show. Actually saw it twice. Can't wait to get the DVD.  One of the best shows I have ever seen,1444089600,12,129,3.607142857142857

The music of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is always wonderful and this is no exception. If I could change anything, it would be to have a few more songs featuring the choir alone--there is a quality to fine choral music that is unique and I would enjoy more of it.",1533340800,,439,4.5

This is childhood living (not just dreaming) as it should be--without patronizing or talking down to anyone. This is one of the best ways of showing the Christmas spirit, through song, dance, music, and humor. And with NO sloppy, poorly sampled techno-grooves nor banal belting-and-blaring by talentless teens and twenty-somethings. And most of all, a reason (though not THE reason) to keep Christmas with you all through the year.
