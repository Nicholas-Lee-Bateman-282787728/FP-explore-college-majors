8219571,5,B000VP37AE,"This DVD has two full length animated features, both very fun for kids. The first is Globehunters. An animated riff on the Jules Verne tale, Around the World in 80 Days. Three animals with the IQ's of rocket scientists, having been genetically modified, escape from the lab to to travel the globe in this musical animated adventure. But a hunter is on their trail. Eddie is a monkey, the adventurous one of the group. Trevor is a parrot capable of mimicking peoples voices, but he also can read and speak to them. Sasha the Cheetah is the action member of the team. They travel by rail, plane, hot air balloon, you name it. Their destinations include the cold of Siberia to the streets of Paris to the shores of mysterious Easter Island. They are searching for an animal utopia,and run into many interesting animals along the way. Great for kids age 3 to pre-teen, good moral lessons about friendship, trust and loyalty. Even though there is a hunter, I did not find anything violent is the story. Great for any kids that like animal stories. It was released in 2002 and runs 73 minutes long.

The next story is more suitable for age 6 and up. In the story, a new game show sends young Leo, Jackie, Margaret, and Alex to a remote island. There they will compete against each other in a survival challenge for a chance to win a million dollars. But on the way their plane crashes in an uncharted island, where they are forced to team up to survive. And by the way, there are dinosaurs. T-Rexes, Raptors, Pterodactyls and more dinosaurs are to be found on the island. This show is a fast paced action-adventure movie. This movie is one of those that parents or babysitting teens will not mind watching too. Released in 2002 and it is 75 minutes long.

The same animation studio, ""DIC"", has released other titles to video and TV, such as a version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Globehunters, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also made the Archie's movies and the Inspector Gadget. Extras on the disc are Inspector Gadget info and fun facts. DVD quality is good, picture and sound clean, no issues with freezing up or anything.",1262649600,,2178,4.596401028277635
