4856635,5,B005PPMHWE,"Love the show, period, end of statement!
However:
The packaging REALLY sucks (two-stars).

The ""seasons"" so-confuses me that I almost missed THIS [4.5{!}] one.

To remedy my almost watching programs out-of-sequence....and they jam up on my video shelves...
I've repackaged them, myself, into NEW, replacement, 4&6-DVD-empty clear cases like THIS:

Season 3 & 3.5 together ([only]4 discs)
Season 3 as the outter wrapper with 3.5 cut to the inside spine.

Another fine show I LIKE with 5-star (*****) packaging is WAREHOUSE THIRTEEN (13) !

While this might present no problem to a NORMAL video-collector, I have been ab-normal for 63 years.

QUAD-CASES can be purchased from various places, but, of course, the CLEAR ones are the best-functioning; -made; and highest-tech!",1333324800,5,1376,7.047058823529412
4856636,5,B005PPMHWE,"You can probably tell that I'm a fan of sci fi from the title to this review, and I am. Eureka is a wonderful show, and season 4.5 holds up the fine quality reputation of the earlier series.",1332547200,2,190,4.026315789473684
4856637,5,B005PPMHWE,"Eureka is easily my favorite show. It's funny, ridiculous, heartfelt, poignant, and endlessly creative all at the same time. It was always a good show, but I think it became a GREAT show when the timeline was reset at the beginning of season four. It's set in the super-secret town of Eureka, Oregon. Orginally a military town, Eureka was founded by Albert Einstein. And, of course, all of the world's greatest discoveries began there. It's filled with geniuses whose experiments constantly go awry. It's usually up to Jack Carter (the everyman sheriff) to find a common sense solution to save the town from destruction - which he ends up doing every week with a little help from his friends.

  You don't have to be a science fiction fan to enjoy this show (I'm not). You just learn to love the characters and the town. In other words ... just go with it! It's well conceived, well written, and perfectly acted.

  It's a HUGE shame to see this show end way too soon and I will miss it! There is a season five yet to come, and I won't give up hope for a tv movie (or several!) in the future.

  Do yourself a favor and get to know Eureka. You'll be glad you did!",1326240000,25,1163,4.397196261682243
4856638,5,B005PPMHWE,Eureka is the best scifi show on the television and it is so sad that it will end next year .I have all the seasons and I love the Xmas special Do You See What I See loved it cant wait for the dvd wish it was blu ray.,1325116800,6,217,3.4489795918367347
4856639,5,B005PPMHWE,"I admire the guts of EUREKA's showrunners and writers. Their time travel do-over ploy at the season's start was brilliant and has reshuffled the dynamics of the show in really interesting ways. But the guts-admiring that I harbor doesn't concern that. No, the ballsy move is the decision to NOT return things to the old status quo. This is the new reality. It's staying this way. And Fargo is still the director of Global Dynamics, and it's startling how infrequently he tends to mess up nowadays. Only a show like EUREKA, with its influx of crazy mad science and anything goes sensibilities, can get away with that sort of game-changing swerve and still plausibly fold it into narrative continuity. Try that on for size, Bob Newhart.

With James Callis's departure, the second half of Season 4 shifts to the furor over the impending deep space voyage to Titan, the largest moon circling Saturn. The eccentric hidden community of Eureka is all a-hubbub over the six month mission as Fargo and Dr. Holly Martin (a recurring Felicia Day) must whittle down 387 applicants to a 20-man crew. But this is merely the backdrop to more episodes concerning out-of-control geniuses and science run amok. Sheriff Jack Carter - our longtime point-of-view everyman character - is still Eureka's dumbest bloke by comparison. And he's still the fix-it guy when things inevitably go kabonkers. And I get a kick that Jack's first go-to move whenever the fit hits the shan is to yell, ""Alright, everybody out!"" Running sub-plots revolve around evil therapist Beverly Barlow's latest transgression (this time targeting Alisson Blake), a romantic triangle evolving amongst Fargo, Holly Marten (Day), and Dr. Parrish (Wil Wheaton), and whether Carter and Allison are ready to move in together. On the disappointing side, it's frustrating that Jo Lupo and Zane can't seem to get their act together. Sadly, the season finale marks the departure of one of the core characters, although the giant hope is that we'll see this person again come Season 5.

If you just abide, there's bound to be a DVD set coming out with the full fourth season of EUREKA. But if you can't wait and you already have EUREKA 4.0, then ponder getting your paws on this one. EUREKA Season 4.5 features these episodes:

- Episode #10 - ""O Little Town"" - Chris Parnell guest stars merrily as Taggart's ""Santaology"" experiment is fiddled with, causing the rapid shrinking of the entire town, perhaps out of existence. A fine Christmas episode.

- Episode #11 - ""Liftoff"" - If you're in camp Fargo, then your boy gets a chance to shine as he and Zane accidentally get launched into space in what was intended to be an unmanned space probe.

- Episode #12 - ""Reprise"" - First appearance of geek goddess Felicia Day as a socially awkward scientist newly arrived to Eureka, except that she unwittingly brung a virus with her which insinuates itself into the town's music database and compels listeners to act out song lyrics.

- Episode #13 - ""Glimpse"" - As scientists vie for a place on the Astraeus mission crew, Jack and Jo field test revolutionary contact lenses which can predict potential security risks. Meanwhile, Alisson's behavior continues to become more erratic.

- Episode #14 - ""Up in the Air"" - Sheriff Carter is apprised of a bank robbery, and this initially excites Carter - he's just happy to land an old-fashioned crime for once - until he learns that the entire bank itself has been stolen. Meanwhile, Allison's time fugues worsen. See this one for Carter's aggravated histrionics when, to save the day, he's forced to dangerously float up to the airborne bank.

- Episode #15 - ""Omega Girls"" - Zoe Carter visits from college and gets her Die Hard on when Eureka's residents fall into a coma and Zoe is left by herself to fend off an incursion.

- Episode #16 - ""Of Mites and Men"" - It's Carter versus a horde of destructive, invulnerable nanite bugs even as several of the Astraeus candidates are confined to a cramped underground cell designed for psychological stress testing.

- Episode #17 - ""Clash of the Titans"" - Wallace Shawn guest stars as a ""relationship auditor"" from the DoD come to Eureka to assess Carter and Allison's relationship. This coincides with the arrival of the robot probe Tiny, except that Tiny has brought along Titan's lethal atmosphere to Eureka. But never mind that. Will Wallace Shawn ruin the good thing Carter and Allison's got going? Inconceivable!

- Episode #18 - ""This One Time at Space Camp..."" - This episode gives us peeks into the Astraeus candidates' pasts as they undergo final interviews. An accident leaves the relationship auditor reliving Carter's past exploits.

- Episode #19 - ""One Small Step"" - The Eureka think tank (and Carter) scrambles to retrieve a steadily declining Deputy Andy who is stranded on Titan and exposed to its unforgivable environs. This is a surprisingly emotional episode that humanizes Deputy Andy and his girlfriend, the smart house Sarah. I love Kavan Smith's performance here as Deputy Andy.

- Episode #20 - ""One Giant Leap"" - Essentially the season finale. On the day of the big launch to Titan, micro black holes appear in Eureka, threatening to destroy the world.

In Episode #21 - ""Do You See What I See?"" - things get a bit... sketchy. It's another fun Christmas episode, one which integrates an out-of-control holobook, evil snow ninjas, and animation (in all its formats) into the story. Note that this episode isn't included in this DVD set but probably will be in the Season 5 DVD release.

So can I get an ""Aaarggh!!""? EUREKA is one of the most wildly inventive shows around, and the Syfy network is opting to kick it to the curb. Suffer not a good show to live, must be the universal motto of these television networks. The plug will be yanked after Season 5, although Syfy was gracious enough to allow for one more episode for closure purposes or whatever, so there'll now be 14 episodes for Season 5, instead of the original commitment of 13. Gee, thanks. For fans of EUREKA this is pretty dire straits. I would suggest launching a Subway drive, but that only worked for so long for CHUCK. I guess, somewhere, Sheriff Carter is reacting to this calamity. He's yelling: ""Alright, everybody out!""

By the way, several folks have mentioned that ""Clash of the Titans"" is missing on this DVD set. But if you go to the episode selection menu on Disc 2, there's an arrow on the right which, when clicked on, will take you to a second episode menu page.

4856648,2,B005PPMHWE,"Do you like shows that involve time travel? Then you may like all of Seasons 4.0 and 4.5. They travel back in time and change things. Then they go back to modern day Eureka, and things are different. The romances have changed, the jobs have changed, etc. It's a ""do over"", but with the same characters and the same science fiction theme. I think the show's writers ran out of ideas, so they tried to re-invent Eureka. No thanks.

4856720,5,B005PPMHWE,"I loved this series from the first season.  I only viewed the first season because someone suggested I might like it--instead I was hooked.  I do not watch TV so I wait until the end of each season and buy the DVD set.  To say the town of Eureka and its denizens is unique, is an understatement.  Each has their own foibles.  I consider it a 2 part series because of it.  There is the town's aspects and the characters aspects.  I want to live there as I watch each episode.

Hilarious things happen in this town what with a group of scientific nerds, and their experiments-which many times go awry. And then there is the sheriff (Colin Fergeson) who is a normal, everyday type of person who by this time (Season 4.5) is better able to handle  the uncanny mistakes that the scientists make.

The entire town and GD (the installation where and for whom they work) are very much a family.  With all that goes with being a family.  Give it a try.  It is fun. It can be sad. It is always interesting. And it is heartwarming.",1408233600,,1020,4.3052631578947365

The only complaint I have is not with Amazon, nor with the supplier of the disk, it's the fact that they chose to make it season 4.5 and season 4. So that instead of getting a complete season on one disc set, you have to purchase 2, this wouldn't be half bad if they took the standard cost and split it in two but they don't. They charge you full price for each half season like I said not Amazon's fault nor the supplier I do recommend this for anyone that enjoys science fiction and a little drama",1399248000,,637,4.145161290322581

Episode 64
""Do You See What I See"" December 6, 2011
(This is a holiday special, and takes place outside the main story.) Crashing over Eureka, a wave of color changes the town to animation of multiple styles and cartoonish effects, including Jack's jeep coming alive, Andy being turned into a cartoonish robot, and Jo becoming a princess. All this caused by the Super Photon Generator, a massive holographic matrix meant as Jack's Christmas gift for the kids (with help from Fargo). Meanwhile, Kevin, Zoey, and Jenna opened a gift early called ""Holotown"", a 'create your own story' book using holograms. It turns out that the gift the kids opened crossed signals with the Super Photon Generator. As the episode goes on, with the main characters aware of the changing animations, the kids add villainous Snow Ninjas to spice up the story. As Jack, Andy, Allison, and Jo make it to the generator, they see Dr. Drummer- a scientist from the last holiday special- trying to fix the generator; but as he is, the snow ninjas join to create a 50 foot snow monster. The kids realize the connection between the generator and their book and give the others a fighting chance with Kevin turning them into Anime to defeat the snow ninja monster. Jack gets Jo close enough to throw a bomb into the monster, blowing it up. As the others fight the Snow Ninja Monster, Allison, Andy, and Dr. Drummer finally repair the generator, returning everyone to normal perspective. At the end of the episode, everyone gets together for a Christmas dinner at the smart house.",1387670400,,7446,4.975060337892196

I sure miss new doings in  the town and the kooky but basically kind people there. Not many shows or movies  out there that combine kind deeds with misguided science, maybe none! I really disliked the constant violence of Alphas and the new one, Continuum where people are thrown around like ragdolls and beaten in just about every episode,  which have replaced my friendly town. While Eureka had deaths, and had some ugly situations brought on by some experiement gone wrong, it was always about how to help, how to save the people, and accomplishing that in heroic acts and teamwork often with humor among the foibles.

4856790,4,B005PPMHWE,I HAVE JUST FINISHED THE FULL SERIES OF EUREKA AND IT IS A FANTASTIC SHOW.  IT CAN BE WATCHED BY ALL THE FAMILY AND THAT IS A PLUS IN THIS DAY AND AGE.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT TO GO ON BUT ALL GOOD THINGS HAVE TO COME TO AN END.  IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE  AND LIKE  SHOWS THAT ARE DIFFERENT WATCH IT.  GAIL,1358208000,,301,3.5538461538461537
4856791,5,B005PPMHWE,This series was one of my favorites. Glad I have the DVD's to revisit the program. Too bad it was taken off the air.,1357776000,,116,3.875
4856792,5,B005PPMHWE,"I can watch Eureka over and over again.  I love seeing the writer's imagination become a reality.  Usually after time-traveling into the past, everything is put back the way they were..not this time.  My favorite show was the ""bank robbery"" and the look on Carter's face!",1356652800,,271,4.8478260869565215
4856793,5,B005PPMHWE,I love the show and hated to see it end. With this I can still enjoy watching the show. It if course has all the episodes from the season. I have really been enjoying watching it.,1356134400,,179,4.0
4856794,4,B005PPMHWE,"The discs didn't always work the way they should.  If I pressed ""Play All"", it would still go from episode to episode.  Also, when I pressed on the next episode to play, it would do the episode I'd just watched.  One episode on one of the discs gave me problems in that you couldn't understand what was being said.  It was like there was a glitch in the program.  I did manage to solve the problem by turning off the player and then turning it back on and using the arrows to procede through each of the episodes until I got to the one I wanted to watched.  At that time, there was no problem with the picture or the sound.",1355875200,,623,4.107438016528926
4856805,5,B005PPMHWE,I'll miss this show. Collect all of the seasons before they are gone if you enjoyed it as much as I did.,1355616000,,104,3.772727272727273
4856806,5,B005PPMHWE,"hello,
  after the shortened season 3,0, then 3.5, season 4 was also short.  along came season 4.5 with some great stories.  this is the only way to watch our favorite series, pop in the dvd and go through the disc.  the story line takes an interesting turn.  it is fun to watch the cast interact and they definitely have grown on us.  can't go wrong with these purchases of eureka... best series on tv for loads of fun and interesting enough, intelligent theories.",1354924800,,465,4.530120481927711
4856807,5,B005PPMHWE,Love this series if you haven't watched it you have got to. It is simply different to all other science series and entrtaining all the way.,1354233600,,139,4.384615384615385
4856808,5,B005PPMHWE,"This entire series is just so wonderful!  I love the fun way it goes about the science.  It is funny, but still manages to hit some points!",1354147200,,139,4.111111111111111
4856809,4,B005PPMHWE,"The story continues, but is showing its age.  Does not have the same impact as earlier years.  Still worth watching",1354147200,,115,4.7
4856810,5,B005PPMHWE,I love love this show! It makes your mind think about the things that are possible to actually achieve today.,1353974400,,109,4.5
4856811,5,B005PPMHWE,"I didn't start watching Eureka til the last year, and then I started from the first season online at Netflix.  I got hooked, but it is the type of show you WANT to see from episode one.  It is a fun, complex show that is never boring.  You grow to love the characters and just like spending time with them (as is true of any really good show).  I bought this because I did not want to wait to see 5 online!!  That's devotion.",1352764800,,425,4.011904761904762
4856812,4,B005PPMHWE,"I still love ""Eureka"". It's still a great show, and still very entertaining. But with Season 4.5, this was the first time that I didn't feel pulled in, and compelled to watch every episode as quickly as possible. The ""Mission to Titan"" story arc did not interest me too much, and something just seemed amiss... perhaps the absence of some characters (like Zoe and Beverly) is catching up to me. That's the only reason that I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. Nonetheless, I still enjoy watching the bumbling misadventures of Sheriff Carter, and I have my hopes high for a strong finale to this great series.",1349654400,,604,4.601851851851852
4856813,4,B005PPMHWE,"Love Eureka but not a big fan of the eco-packaging or the split season. The disks are a bit more difficult to remove and the cardboard sleeve isn't gonna stand up well for long. I'll probably transfer to a standard DVD case ... so how is that eco-friendly?

Season 4 started with a complete disruption to the story line but, finished on a good note so I encourage fans to keep watching.",1346457600,,386,4.361111111111111
4856814,4,B005PPMHWE,"Eureka season 4.5 was excellent with one problem,on disk 2 the episode ""Clash of the Titans"" was missing. The missing episode leaves a a hole in the story.",1346198400,,155,4.571428571428571
4856825,5,B005PPMHWE,Eureka was one of the best shows on television. Thank goodness I can revisit the show whenever I like and enjoy the actors and storylines by inserting the DVD into my DVD player.,1345420800,,178,4.424242424242424
4856826,5,B005PPMHWE,perfect there were no problems with this product all disks worked as expected. there is no need to add more words to get to a total of twenty.,1344988800,,142,4.107142857142857

4856828,5,B005PPMHWE,"Over the last 10 years I've very rarely watched television, but when I saw the commercials for Eureka I was hooked. It's a great show and the only one that I've followed from beginning to end. Lots of cool scientific ideas. I was so disappointed when SiFy decided to end the show.",1344556800,,280,4.403846153846154
4856829,5,B005PPMHWE,"The product is great the seller got this shipped out and in my hands super fast. This is the season where the creators decided to ""reboot"" the series. They did this in one of the most innovative ways imaginable they did this by sending the cast back to 1947 to the opening of the wonderful town called Eureka. There are so many great moments in this series and I have been watching them since 2006 when the series was launched and it saddens me greatly that the syfy channel decided to cancel the show after season 5. So in the end I have to tell you all that even if you are not interested in watching this show from beginning to end you can start watching it from season 4.5 and not be lost at all. So pick it up and add this to your collection. Thanks for reading and great watching to you all.",1343865600,,797,4.148387096774194

4856832,5,B005PPMHWE,"Holy Toledo!  What the heck's going on--Grant's leaving Ghost Hunters and Eureka is being cut.  Mad scientists may not be unique, but put them all in one town--run for it! What a great series and seasons.  Not another show like it.  I can watch the DVD over again and still find something subtle I missed. I'd like to know what the SyFy channel is thinking. I refuse to buy any Vampire/vampirilla series; vampires, fake ghosts, and werewolfs are so predictable and outdated-nothing creative about any of those.  You can never predict how a day in Eureka is going to go.  The only redeeming shows left are Haven (probably cutting that too) and Alphas. Both are highly imaginative, creative and one of a kind, too. No doubt that Eureka will be Pop Culture soon after it ends.",1336608000,,773,4.647058823529412
4856833,5,B005PPMHWE,"What a fantastic series!  I still cannot believe they have cancelled it.
What were they thinking??  This is one of the best, most imaginative
shows on TV.  It will be greatly missed after this last season is over.",1335571200,,213,4.552631578947368
4856834,5,B005PPMHWE,This is the most creative television show ever! The writing is fresh and there is something in for everyone. Funny and Smart,1335571200,,124,4.681818181818182
4856845,2,B005PPMHWE,"Well, they did it again. Not only did we get screwed out of the Christmas episode from last year (so we get it this year), but now they bump ""Clash of the Titans"" to put two ""Of Mites and Men"" -- one was the regular version, and one was the extended version. What idiot wants to lose one entire episode in order to watch a regular version, when one would have watched the extended version in the first place, without having to bump an episode. I'm glad they cancelled the show; I can't take this aggravation any more.  Anyway, the writers strayed from their initial vision years ago (whatever happened to the artifact?) (alternate time line???? yeah, right).

4856846,5,B005PPMHWE,"Eureka has gone from strength to strength, never boring, the characters are so complex, all the actors are so well suited to this series, this season has gone back to it's bare roots, Eureka is really the thinking persons show, it combines humor, drama, scfi together, I could not wait to get this set, I sat down with popcorn in hand and watched the whole series in one hit, I really love this show, though I was disappointed to hear the next series number 5 will be the last, it's like losing an old friend, so sad, there will never be another Eureka, if you have not seen this series and are a scfi fan, do have a look, you will be hooked.",1335225600,,642,4.227642276422764

4856850,5,B005PPMHWE,I love the show and buying the DVDs have been well worth the buy.  But like Season 2 through 4.0 this set is in the green packaging that leaves a lot to be desired.  All Universal Studios and SyFy have done is forced me to buy blank cases to replace the cheap ones they have included with the set.  They fall apart way too easily.  Even if it cost a couple of bucks extra for the better plastic cases I would pay the extra because I intend to keep these for a long time to come which is far longer than the current packing will last on the DVDs.,1333929600,,545,3.9724770642201834
4856851,1,B005PPMHWE,"Anyone that buys half seasons of any show, or incomplete seasons for that matter is just plain dumb.  In buying partial seasons, you support higher costs offered by the producing company.  They do it to make more money.  Be a smart shopper and demand the abolishment of partial seasons.  By not buying them, they cannot make money and thus could end our suffering of partial seasons.",1333497600,5,383,4.757575757575758
4856852,5,B005PPMHWE,"Life in Eureka is as nutty as ever. Sheriff Carter keeps going through jeeps (I think they must order them in bulk by now), and nothing is ever normal. When he thinks someone robbed a bank, Carter is thrilled - and his notation that Eureka can't do anything the regular way is right on target. On the end of the disc is an episode of Warehouse 13, where Fargo guest stars. Eureka is science at its most hilarious.",1333411200,,413,4.3076923076923075
4856853,5,B005PPMHWE,"Seriously. They are down to nubbins and absolutely pathetic, superstitious 'reality programming'. They have a gem in Eureka. A witty, wildly implausible and very enjoyable sci-comedy romp. This show is hands down the most original and creative offering on the boob tube. Maybe not the best show on TV, but certainly the most creatively scripted and developed dramedy going. I'll be deleting SyFy from my Fios favorites when this show goes dark - not to voice my displeasure with their abject stupidity, but rather, because of outside of Warehouse13, they'll simply have nothing to watch.",1333324800,5,587,5.189473684210526
4856854,3,B005PPMHWE,"5 stars for the show, 1 star for the discs. I love the show, but the discs are something else entirely. When I insert the discs into my dvd player (which is fairly new), the discs won't properly load-the discs essentially cause my dvd player to shut itself off and I have to eject the discs and reload a few times for them to play.  This has happened to me only one other time, with Season 5 of Sliders.  Both sets have the same disc appearance and have been processed by Technicolor.  Anyone else have this problem?  I've played dozens of other dvds ranging from those bought 12 years ago to new ones and this has only happened with these two sets.",1333324800,,649,4.295081967213115
