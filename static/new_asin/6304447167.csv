7873326,5,6304447167,"This is one of those videos where you have to ask yourself, ""who would think up something like this?""  The soudtrack is all big band jazz, there is no narration.  The video is a mix of clips showing the performers of the music (actually playing the songs you're hearing) and extended sections of video showing all kinds of steam railroads.  I bought this video for my son who loves trains and myself who loves jazz--we're both happy!  The video can be playing and I'm not irritated by stupid dialog and commentary as I work at the computer.  I'm happy with my purchase but realize that this is definitely a niche product.",1036195200,4,621,4.558558558558558
