7969055,5,B00006I047,"Eastern Conference Records was a major player in the independent hip hop scene on the East Coast from the 1990's into the 2000's, and put out records by many great MC's of the time. This DVD is a time capsule of sorts, a glance back at what was going on in Philadelphia, NYC, and elsewhere. Live performance footage and music videos are included. Smut Peddlers, Cage Kennylz, and more. Beetlejuice from Howard Stern even makes an appearance.",1517270400,,441,4.740259740259741
7969056,5,B00006I047,"Eastern Conference is the best underground Hip-Hop label out there right now and they finally release their debut DVD. Featuring videos from the EC All-Stars, High & Mighty, and Smut Peddlers, along with outtakes from Beetlejuice and some interviews (a particularly disturbing one with pornography afficionado Bob Goldstein) make for an all around great DVD. The biggest problem however is the format. This wasn't exactly set up all that well and you must keep going back to the menu to view the next thing. If you like EC pick this up (the ""Bottom Feeders"" video is legendary).",1049155200,3,578,4.969072164948454
