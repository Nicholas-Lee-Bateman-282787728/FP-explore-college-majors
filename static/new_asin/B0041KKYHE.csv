4243841,4,B0041KKYHE,"I have to admit that Water for Elephants was a decent representation of the book.  Take into consideration that a movie is never going to give you 100% of the book.  That being said, I was disappointed with the parts of the book the movie left out.  There were lots of little details and nuances that just can't come across on the full screen anyway, although you would have liked to have seen how they would have been portrayed.  Although too numerous to mention and for those who haven't read the book it wouldn't matter anyway, the biggest (for those who have read it) would be the comedic scenes that play out with Jacob in the nursing home.  All of those chapters were completely left out.

We open with an old man (Hal Holbrook) wandering into the parking lot of a circus that is packing up and moving out.  A workman comes out to see if he is lost and invites him in out of the rain while the man calls the nursing home.  The old man looks at the old black and white circus photos on the wall and recalls out loud which circuses they are from.  This grabs the worker's attention and he mentions the Benzini Brothers Circus tragedy from years ago.  The old man says he was there and the worker asks him to tell him about it.  We flash back to a younger gentleman played by Robert Pattinson and the movie is played out as a flashback of the old man's story.

Although I never would have expected it, Robert Pattinson plays out a perfect Jacob.  That irresistible smile he gets on his face when he's around the animals definitely lets us connect with Jacob the way we wanted to see him connecting with Rosie the elephant. Perfect choice for the part!

Christoph Waltz was a decent August, the ring master and circus owner.  I pictured someone larger and darker, maybe more Italian looking, when I was reading the book but August's charm and charisma as a business man, and brutality and harshness as a monster, really made him a different type of character that readers will both appreciate and despise.  We really see him on the verge of snapping and just how quickly it can happen.  There is one scene where he becomes angry with Rosie that really sets that uncomfortable tone you get from him in the book.

Reese was Reese, what can I say.  She's beautiful to look at, but just not as sexy and alluring as Marlena comes across sometimes in the book.  Still a decent performance from her though and she and Robert make a cute couple.

Speaking of sex, there's a lot of it in the book including a strip tease tent in the circus. Those scenes are in the movie, but treated with dignity and careful camera angles - obviously allowing this movie its PG13 rating.  It drags in places where we have to witness the slow glances and connections being made between Jacob and Marlena.  August's discovery of the two is a bit rushed, but after that the action picks up making the last half of the movie pretty solid.  The sad redlighting treatment of circus workers being thrown from the train out of spite and to lighten the financial load is there, balanced with a breathtaking scene of Jacob and August walking across the top of the train in motion.  And then there's old Rosie, and you can't help but smile along with Jacob at the gentle beast when she performs or is providing comedic relief.

Non-book readers might find the movie a bit slow at times but will enjoy it overall.  After all, we each have our own favorite circus act, right?  Some book lovers will certainly be disappointed, but if you try hard to approach the movie with a different set of eyes (and lower your expectations just a tad) you will be well entertained.  I know I was.",1303603200,267,3646,4.448795180722891
4243842,2,B0041KKYHE,"""Water for Elephants"" is a flat soap opera lacking flair or heart or even coherence. It's a love story set in a Depression-era circus; how could it be so boring? Direction and miscasting. Director Francis Lawrence never milks the Depression or the circus setting. He directs as if in the suburban living and bedrooms of television's Pine Valley. You never get the sense of how a Depression-era, small-town kid would be thrilled, terrified, and curious seeing a lion or an elephant for the first time. There are a couple of what appear to be CGI shots of a train chugging across moonlit landscapes; even these lack magic.

Robert Pattinson, star of the teen-vampire sensation ""Twilight,"" is miscast as Jacob, the lead character, a circus vet. Pattinson displays the skills necessary to make teenage girls swoon: he pouts, he broods, he is self-absorbed, he makes zero intellectual or psychological demands on his audience. He has heavy brows and lots of hair. These skills deserve respect. They cause teen girl fans to post reviews of his work that end in multiple exclamation points!!!!!!! But Pattinson is in so far over his head in ""Water for Elephants"" all you see of him, in some scenes, are bubbles on the surface as he sinks into invisibility.

Reese Witherspoon is a crisp and perky professional with shiny hair and perfect teeth. Problem is, she's playing Marlena, an orphan trick horse rider who marries an abusive circus boss, August (Christoph Waltz.) Marlena should exude desperate vulnerability combined with manipulative power, the kinky raw sex appeal of a woman who, scantily clad in skin-tight, revealing costumes, performs suggestive tricks with muscly animals in front of applauding throngs. Witherspoon doesn't even try to bring that Marlena to life. She just plays Reese Witherspoon, professional movie star with flawless hair and teeth, a little bit bored as Oprah interviews her. There's nothing of the abusive orphanage, the poor street, the skanky Big Top about her at all.

Robert Pattinson's Jacob and Reese Witherspoon's Marlena have zero chemistry. They are the least sexy screen couple I've ever seen. Al Gore and Bill Clinton had more chemistry. When they do kiss, it's not that long-awaited, thrilling moment of release. It's ""Huh?""

Christoph Waltz as August, the circus owner, is from a completely different, much better, movie. People are going to walk out of this film wishing that they could have seen the movie centered around Christoph Waltz's August. Waltz demands the audience's attention in a way that no one else in the film does, except Tai as the elephant, Rosie. Waltz's nuanced performance brings to life an August who is very complex and worth caring about, despite his being a monster.

It's clear that Sara Gruen, the book's author, and the filmmaker wanted to tell a story that featured lots of animals. The plot is a cobbled-together, soulless bit of scaffolding on which to hang shots of circus animals and shallow depictions of circus rituals. Why is Jacob a Polish speaker? Why is the elephant a speaker of Polish? Most Polish immigrants to the US at this time were descendents of recently liberated serfs, and did very harsh manual labor in the US: coal mining, steel, cleaning. It's very unlikely that a Polish speaker would be an Ivy League veterinary school graduate. In any case, the film makes no use of Jacob's ethnicity. He could as easily be Spanish or Italian or Greek. Why would a man who had the focus and self-discipline to complete an Ivy League veterinary school education toss aside, literally, everything he has worked for, and everything he owns, to jump on a passing train? The moment utterly lacks verisimilitude and psychological depth. It's obvious that the film just wants to get to its circus setting and animals. Jacob is just a pawn. Why is the film told as an old man's flashback? That approach, and the voiceover narration, add nothing to the film.",1303603200,11,3931,4.9771689497716896
4243843,5,B0041KKYHE,"Water For Elephants is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year so far.  It is an entertaining film that features an actor and actress who have perfect on screen chemistry.  Robert Pattinson is a veternarian student named Jacob who hops aboard a train after his parents are killed in a car accident. He discovers the train is a travelling circus.  Reese Witherspoon plays a circus performer named Marlena.  She is married to Albert who runs the circus show.  He is played by Christoph Waltz.  I like how the relationship between Pattinson and Witherspoon starts off as friendship and blossoms into a romance. Christoph Waltz has a talent for playing a villain. His only ambition is to pack people under the circus tent.  His character creates a romantic tension in the movie. Hal Holbrook rounds out the cast.  He is the narrator of the story playing the role of older version of Jacob. Holbrook is sentimental and funny in the early scenes of the movie.

I am amazed at the kinds of tricks and moves that director Francis Lawrence gets the elephant to do.  There are a few scenes of animal cruelty in the film.  I hope this does not turn people away from seeing this movie.  No animals were hurt in this film.  These scenes are merely staying true to the spirit of the novel.  There are also many scenes in which animals are treated with gentleness and care. Water For Elephants is a film set in 1931 during the Depression.  Composer James Newton Howard captures the spirit of that time with his score. His score is exciting and romantic at times.  The soundtrack also features a song by Bessie Smith entitled ""I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl"".  This is a sassy blues tune that I have never heard of before. I  absolutely love this song and the entire soundtrack.  Water For Elephants is romantic, funny and dramatic at different parts. This combination makes this movie one of the best I have seen all year.",1303603200,9,1921,4.580645161290323
4243844,3,B0041KKYHE,"If you were a fan of Sara Gruen's gritty and romantic novel, don't expect to see it in this film. Though visually stunning, the film's miscasting woes and lack of real chemistry makes the film seem like a shallow, pale version of the gripping novel.

Witherspoon and Pattinson are both able actors, but they make an odd pairing with little sizzle on screen. It is doubtful the two were ever auditioned together before being offered the roles, if they had, perhaps the casting would have been different. Witherspoon does her best with what she's given, and Pattinson, despite being the main character, has very little dialogue compared to the enormous amount of closeups featuring hard glares and longing stares.

The film's only real bright spot is Waltz as the vicious ringmaster, August. Waltz is fantastic as ever, but far too reminiscent of his role in Inglorious Bastards. The movie cheapens the depth and complexity of the book's August by senselessly marrying him with the novel's disreputable ringmaster Uncle Al, ignoring his kind and charismatic moments, and never questioning his mental stability. This makes it far to easy for the audience to see August as unequivocally malicious, rather than making the audience sit with the discomfort of being in his wife Marlena's shoes: adoring the charismatic and vibrant August and fearing his violent and psychotic side. In my opinion, it is August's two sides that make him both pitiable and terrifying, allowing for a more complex experience, emphasizing the truth that there is no black and white, good or evil, but shades of gray in between.

Witherspoon's Marlena is performed as well as possible, seeing as the script writers seem to have ripped the spine right out of the poor character. In classic Hollywood style, the script unnecessarily rewrites details of the story to make her seem like a broken damsel in distress just waiting for someone like Pattinson's Jacob to rescue her. Without the sass and courage of the book's Marlena, it is confusing why Jacob would be interested in her other than the old sexist notion that he needs to ""fix"" her.

If you haven't read the book, then what a fun adventure this film must be. And I admit that at times I too was swept up in the grandeur of the set dressing. But the film manages to trade in the book's gripping and complex love triangle for the ease of a domestic abuse rescue story that simply rubs the wrong way.",1303516800,59,2425,4.836144578313253
4243845,4,B0041KKYHE,"I was very hesitant to see this movie, because I am a big fan of the novel ""Water for Elephants"" and I was terrified the movie studio would screw up the film version. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The filmmakers did make some changes from Sarah Gruen's book, but overall I think the movie stayed very true to the heart of the novel. The cast was fantastic, especially the actors who played the three main characters (Robert Pattinson especially gets props for this role, which should silence any naysayers who claim the ""Twilight"" golden boy can't act). The movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Big Fish."" It was beautiful to watch but was also incredibly character-focused, with elements of fantasy and whimsy. I loved the movie and highly recommend it.",1303430400,10,758,4.75
4243846,4,B0041KKYHE,"I just came back from seeing this movie, and I really liked it! Now I could be nit picky about certain things but I won't, because overall I enjoyed it.

This is also one of those rare cases where the movie outdoes the book! since for the book my rating would be around 3/3.5 stars. I really enjoyed the storyline/atmosphere and the beautiful visuals. I cared about all the characters (especially Jacob/Marlena), and felt drawn inside the story. Rosie our fourth character was great as well, she easily wins the viewer's heart.

Also, the music in this movie is sweeping (very atmospheric and magical), I loved it.

In the end, this is a good movie",1303430400,11,648,4.6173913043478265
4243847,5,B0041KKYHE,"I was captivated by the book but now that I've seen the clips, I'm even more convinced that this movie will join the ranks of the film classics such as Titanic.

From what I've seen this appears to be a feast for the eyes and shot in the manor of the Metro Goldwyn Mayer classics of old Hollywood.  It depicts all the glamor that is the circus and all the drama that was The Great Depression.  It was a time in our countries history when we were naive and learned the realities and harshness of life first hand.  Much like the main character, a young Jacob Jankowski.

I expect Francis Lawrence and Jack Fisk to work their magic and transport me to another place and time.  I know I won't be disappointed.",1302566400,6,705,4.303030303030303
4243848,5,B0041KKYHE,"I was wondering when they would finally get around to filming this incredible book. It is up there in my top 10 with To Kill a Mockingbird and Pride and Prejudice. I have not seen the movie, (obviously -- since it hasn't opened yet), but the book is so visual on its own that I find it hard to imagine that the director and writers could screw it up. [By the way -- the audio version of this book is one of the best I've ever listened to, with one actor doing the voice of Jacob at 90 (or 93) and the other as Jacob as a young man. The result is wonderful listening.] How can you go wrong when you have a love story taking place amidst the color and wonder of a circus, (complete with side show and freaks). It is a very brutal story at times, but never so much so that it seems out of sync with the characters. The trailer doesn't show Jacob as an old man - I hope they didn't decide to eliminate that part of the story - it's exceeding important. Without it, you just get a typical Hollywood fluff piece. With it, you get much more of a sense of wonder at the life this old man had in his youth and the tragedy of its loss. We'll see if they stayed true with the book or not.",1299369600,12,1177,3.970464135021097
4243849,5,B0041KKYHE,"I find a loss for words.  But since this is a review, Iwill find a few!
I cannot wait to see this movie.  I have read the book, and feel the actors were chosen perfectly for their
roles.  I am a very supportive Robert Pattinson fan.  Reese Witherspoon looks beautiful, and is such a good actress.
I truly detested Christoph in ""Inglorious Basterds""  that is why I feel he is magnificent.
I actually had tears in my eyes watching this extended trailer.  Robert is so handsome, we know this, but his portrayal
of Jacob Jankowski is mesmorizing.  I love these movies that depict old times.  They are so real and genuine.
My parents grew up in the depression time, and I actually had an uncle who hopped a train to join the circus!
One of my parents is in a nursing home, and I truly relate to this story.
Excellent is my review!  Thanks for showing it.",1299110400,47,849,4.356687898089172

The only thing his movie does well, is crap all over the source material.
This was a great book!
But whomever wrote this into a movie... I am at a loss of words for how bad it is.
They start the movie where the book ends, and leave out the nursing home entirely.  Which removes half of the story.  The story is also about loneliness and growing old.  That part of the book is so deep and charming.
They took all the punchiest bullet points of the book and condensed it into 2 hours.  They could have left out some of the bullet points and worked more on character development.  Which I feel is lacking for every character.
Booooooooooooo
The only thing that makes this movie at all interesting is the great casting.  Its the only thing that remotely makes this piece of crap watchable.",1521676800,,834,4.348387096774194

Definitely suggest reading the book first if you are a reader, it's much more descriptive and gave more life to the characters. I also agree with others in that the book is so much more than Marlena being a damsel in distress for Jacob to save.",1518739200,,488,4.609195402298851
