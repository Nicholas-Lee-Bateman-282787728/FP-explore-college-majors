3881931,4,B0029XFN80,"Charlie Chan Collection, Vol 1 - 5

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Five movies were produced before his death. Over forty movies featured Charlie Chan. They were popular in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China.

In recent times the popularity of detective stories has waned, unless they are on a police force instead of a owner-operated business. How many movies show a private investigator who clears the innocent and reveals the guilty? Warner Oland was the first actor to star in this popular series. This volume contains five movies plus background information. For more information read Ken Hankes book Charlie Chan at the Movies and Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations decades ago. TV prefers films in color instead of the monochrome common to many films before the 1960's. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies. See the individual reviews for more details.

* THE LOST WARNER OLAND FILMS:
Apparently all prints and negatives of four films were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1937.
Through some fancy footwork, Warner Video has been able to bring three of them back to life:

--- ""Charlie Chan Carries On"" (1931)
Simultaneously with this lost film, a Spanish-language version was filmed using the same sets and costumes:
""Eran trece"" (""There Were Thirteen"") starring MANUEL ARBO (photo 3) as Charlie Chan.
It's in VOLUME 1 with English subtitles (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"")

--- ""Charlie Chan's Chance"" (1932) and ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (1934)
Warner Video cleverly reproduced these lost films using voice actors, the original screenplay, still photos and music. Sort of like a one hour radio show with illustrations:
""Charlie Chan's Chance"" is in VOLUME 3 (coupled with ""The Black Camel"")
""Charlie Chan's Courage"" is in VOLUME 4 (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"")
Too bad they didn't do the same with ""Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"" (1933)

CHARLIE CHAN'S ASSISTANTS
Beginning with the eighth film (""Charlie Chan in Paris""), the series introduced various family members to assist their father in crime-solving.
Over the next fifteen years, four sons and two daughters fulfilled this role, all played by Chinese-American actors:
1) Lee = ten films (Keye Luke)
2) Jimmy = thirteen films (Sen Yung - later billed as Victor Sen Yung)
3) Tommy = eleven films (Benson Fong or Sen Yung)
4) Eddie = one film (Edwin Luke)
5) Iris = one film (Marianne Quon )
6) Frances = one film (Frances Chan - her actual name)

For a breakdown of the films that each family member was in (also details about Birmingham Brown)

3881981,5,B0029XFN80,"I watched Charlie Chan mysteries in movies and on television while I was growing up. There was action, adventure, travel, challenge, entertainment, and a lesson. These movies were not free of violence, but they were free of gratuitous violence. These plays were not trying to display in great detail the reality of everyday life, but rather the idealized version of how life should be and how it could be if we just honored the basic social contract of respecting one another rather than lying, cheating, stealing, injuring, and killing one another. The message these movies contain is that the truth always comes out in the end and good will prevail over evil. That is a very positive and encouraging message, and it makes for good entertainment as well.",1382572800,,755,4.90625
3881982,5,B0029XFN80,"This series of films, I don't think get the credit they deserve.  The intriguing story lines, creative murder methods, and suttle humor worked in throughout, are terrific. I saw many of these growing up, but never caught them all, so I was excited to see them put together as a collection.  The DVD's were put together good too, not a lot of excess muck and advertising to get thru to the play button. I enjoy both of the actors that played Mr. Chan -- just like the string of different 007's each played the character differently, but I liked both styles very much.  As I have been enjoying again the ones I'd seen,  and the ones I never saw aired over the years, I find myself wishing there had been more.",1382054400,2,707,4.374045801526718
3881983,5,B0029XFN80,"I've acquired many Charlie Chan collections over the years but this DVD series bests them all.  The quality of video and audio mastering is really very good.  I'm a big Charlie Chan fan and am fortunate to also have acquired many of the later Monogram Pictures Corporation series filmed during the 1940s and released by MGM/UA and other studios.  Some of which are very hard to obtain.  The earlier Fox series presentations contained in this collection are much better by comparison in terms of plot, acting and characters.  And at this price are an incredible bargain.",1379376000,3,569,4.885416666666667

In addition to the movies, there are a bunch of special features that give you a lot of background. Well worth the cost of acquiring it!!",1361145600,3,284,4.277777777777778
3881988,5,B0029XFN80,"I bought this set of Charlie Chan because I'd hadn't seen them on cable for a long time and my old VHS copies went the way of history.  This is a collection of the 5 individual Chan sets, there are five slipcases containing 20 nice dvd cases. For the most part each film is on its own disk, except for the fifth set where 6 of the films are on double sided dvds.  The extras: trailers, stills, mini documentaries are sprinkled throughout the disks.  The films are clear and the sound is good.  This is an excellent set for the money and Charlie Chan is as enjoyable as ever.

Just so you know, this is not all of the surviving Chan films.  There are more movies out there!!!",1329696000,4,674,4.2265625

8358463,5,B0029XFN80,"Bought these for my mom before she passed. I found these again a little after her funeral, and watched every single episode. Black and white movies hold a certain class to em, and its cool to look back in time. Even in an era where there was racist, this show sometimes will display correct ways to handle those situations. Also, its pretty neat to see someone solve a mystery without the use of new technology, even if it is fake.",1503014400,,431,4.4
