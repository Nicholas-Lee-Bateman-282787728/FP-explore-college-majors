8755934,4,B01DGNBKYM,"Smart Danish-Swedish thriller Bron/Broen is the source for The Tunnel from PBS. It was also the basis for FX hit The Bridge, a favorite for anyone who loves neo noir.

You might have heard about the opening. A dead woman is found on the border between two countries. The PBS adaptation uses the Channel Tunnel between Great Britain and France. Detectives from both sides show up to investigate, affable Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane) of England and straight forward Elise Wassermann (Clmence Posy) of France. Karl is all too willing to let France handle the case. That changes when the corpse is lifted and falls into two parts.

Forensics quickly discover the victims are a French politician and an English prostitute. Its the work of a serial killer who calls himself the Truth Terrorist. Having managed to film the discovery, he broadcasts it over the Internet. He next contacts sensationalist reporter Danny Hillier (Tom Bateman) to brag hes not done yet. The killer has five more truths he plans to share; more will die.

Theres more than one red herring in this complex, 10 episode season. You don't dare look away from the screen, not unless you want to miss a clue. Also, ""The Tunnel"" is the first Anglo-French series to use bilingual dialogue; subtitles run throughout.

The Tunnel was nominated for three prestigious European awards, winning an International Emmy for best actor for Stephen Dillane. But his aging detective is only one of several remarkable performances, including Posys Elise, whose blunt social skills allow her to compartmentalize clues and solve puzzles. She is frequently rude, a habit Karl tries to finesse. His natural empathy makes him a target for ladies in distress, women he just cant resist. That habit has cost him in his personal life, especially in his relationship with his oldest son, Adam (Jack Lowden).

Shot on location in Kent, England, and northern France, cinematographers maintain a natural palette. While noir showcases dark tones, the series refrains from artificial filters. It looks very good on PBSs 1080p transfer, conveying cinematic quality in depth and detail. The 5.1 bilingual soundtrack has a low key quality that makes it seem as if weve just stepped into or eavesdropped on a conversation. There is plenty of ambient sound, but effects are limited. When gunshots or explosions arrive, they're not overdone. Its a unique style and works well in context with the story.

Bonus features are a series of short interviews with the actors, writer and executive producer, as well as a behind-scenes featurette ported from European presentations. Dillane says the storys social messages pulled him in. Posy says they decided to change her characters autism to deliberate social isolation. We decided to define her as someone who loves truth and order, knowledge, who reads a lot. Her life is about her work, she says.

An eight-part Season Two aired April-May 2016 and Ill look forward to its arrival on disc. Id like to see more of these characters. Karl, Elise and the mystery carries us through Season One, even when the plot gets a bit out of hand about three-quarters through. One of those herrings is really slippery.

Still, the ending is remarkable, in keeping with the Raymond Chandler mysteries starring Robert Mitchum. For those who like a complex tale, The Tunnel fills the bill. Recommended.   Kay Reynolds",1473120000,3,3376,5.044883303411131
