4982420,3,B006BIA7T4,"I agree with the previous review.  These routines are for people with considerable latin dance experience.  There isn't any explanation of the steps prior to doing the routing. So, it is very difficult to get in step and follow along.  I'm going back to my DVD from a few years ago.",1325376000,2,282,4.490196078431373
4982421,2,B006BIA7T4,"I am a long time Jazzercise veteran (and a former instructor). I also have two friends who have been doing Jazzercise a few years and they are not a fan of this DVD either. The choreography is too advanced (unless you are a dancer used to this kind of dance) and Cheryl's cueing is not as clear and helpful as it usually is for Jazzercise. Her cueing is usually too fast, inadequate, and too late for the complexity of the moves you are about to do.  It's great to see a new DVD from Jazzercise, but this one is kind of a bummer.",1325376000,4,529,4.135922330097087
8496115,1,B006BIA7T4,Not impressed with the work out at all.  Jazzercise has much better workout videos.,1513900800,,83,4.928571428571429
8496116,5,B006BIA7T4,"This is just  what I wanted.  No extras needed - mats, weights, etc.  Just ways to move the body to a good beat;
warm uip, high aerobics and then cool down,  Exactly what I ordered.",1398211200,,181,4.085714285714285
8496117,4,B006BIA7T4,This was fun but hard to follow the moves with the professional dancer. Felt awkward trying to keep up. Following Judy was fine.,1390780800,,128,4.608695652173913
8496118,2,B006BIA7T4,"I should have really read the reviews.  I'm just desperate for a great Latin Dance workout (that isn't Zumba), so I forged ahead.

This is where I have to be indelicate; While Judi Sheppard Missett is considered a pioneer in the aerobic exercise field, it's time for her to be content with being behind the scenes (at least in the Latin Dance oeuvre).  She is still in great shape, and I don't want to take anything away from her exercise accomplishments. HOWEVER, watching her try to do a Latin groove is painful and it made me sad; for she clearly was not cut out for this particular style.  After trying to go along with it, I began to dread her sequences, which seem to outnumber Cheryl Burke's.

Ultimately, I wanted more Cheryl Burke, but even those sequences fell flat for me.  I feel like she was too limited by Jazzercise.",1369353600,2,831,4.506666666666667
8496119,3,B006BIA7T4,Judi Sheppard Misset's Jazzercise part of the video is easy to follow but that other lady was VERY tough.  I'm not coordinated enough to do those moves.  I will stick with Jazzercise only!,1360368000,,188,4.666666666666667
8496120,3,B006BIA7T4,"I love Jazzercise, but I was disappointed by this workout video. It's not that good, it is okay and it isn't horrible, but I am not sure it's worth the money.",1349654400,,158,4.129032258064516
8496121,1,B006BIA7T4,"All it is is step-ball-change over and over,to the right to the left, around in a circle,faster slower...oh, yeah, now lift your arms.  YUK!",1331856000,2,140,4.833333333333333
8496122,2,B006BIA7T4,"I am a jazzerciser, have been for years and I love the home workouts. This one is not jazzercise, only when Judi teaches the routine can you follow along. The other routines lead by Cheryl Burke are more like a dance show,you watch her dance and try to follow along. She gives no cues on right or left feet and what to do with them. Its very difficult to follow her. She is a great dancer but she is not a jazzercise instructor!! I ended up forwarding until Judi was leading the routine and so I only got a half workout! Save your money, this one is not worth it!",1331596800,2,563,4.127272727272727
8496123,2,B006BIA7T4,"I had high hopes for this one.  Jazzercise has a great reputation and I love Latin dancing.  I expected a perfect combination.  Instead, I have a DVD w great drumming, lousy direction and an instructor so embarassingly bad, I thought she was satirizing other dance DVDs.

I could follow this DVD because I have experience w Latin dance.  If you don't, look elsewhere.  On the routines and steps I couldn't follow, I danced on my own.  NOTE: this DVD offers absolutely NO INSTRUCTION to the steps.  It is up to you to jump in and follow the instructors' vague direction.

Cheryl Burke is extremely talented and her routines involved some advanced choreography.  When I first hear Judy Missett's voice and watched her movement, I thought she was making fun of bad dancers.  She is terribly stiff in her movements and exceptionally uninspired.  I am embarassed for Missett.

The drums are good.  I worked up a sweat and definitely raised my heartrate.  However, this DVD was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  If you want to enjoy Latin dance, receive instruction and work up a sweat, buy a DVD by Giselle Escobar, Jennifer Galardi or Vanessa Isaac.",1331251200,3,1135,4.803108808290156
8496124,4,B006BIA7T4,"Cheryl is a great teacher. It's fun learning the latin dances and it is challenging even after learning the steps.  The camera angle occasionally
viewing the back of some gals head can be frustrating at times and Judi Missett is like a little wooden stick figure but it is a fun workout.",1327276800,,287,4.519230769230769
