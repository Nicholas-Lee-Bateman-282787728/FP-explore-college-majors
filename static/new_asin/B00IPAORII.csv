8644413,5,B00IPAORII,"This was a great movie. One of the best slashers I've seen in a long time. The ending was great. The acting was great. This movie reminded me of some slashers like 'My Bloody Valentine' and 'The Prowler'. I thought the killer was good. This is a solid B movie. I had a friend who has a huge horror dvd collection point this one out.

  I recommend this movie to all slasher and horror movie fans. It's a little gem of a horror movie. When I saw this I had low expectations but this film delivered. Cheers",1520121600,,504,4.175257731958763
8644414,1,B00IPAORII,"Dull slasher film about a bunch of youngish people who like to break into abandoned buildings to play elaborate games of paintball.  Unfortunately this time they picked a shuddered hospital that is home to the title character and the place where he tortures and kills young women that he manages to kidnap--although those scenes consist of little more than actresses screaming.

Since the killer of the title was a construction worker who got fired for violent behavior on a job site he tends to use a lot of tools (including power tools although how he manages to charge them in a building that can't possibly have electricity is a mystery) which gives this a little of the feel of The Toolbox Murders.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to have given very little thought to creative ways the characters might be killed with said tools and they also seem to have forgotten to hire a make-up artist to create onscreen gore effects.

Hazard Jack has more character development than your average slasher film but it lacks any of the things that people actually watch slasher movies for--suspense, imaginative kills, onscreen gore.  Your average Friday the 13th film is a whole lot gorier than Hazard Jack and also a lot more fun.  This is decent in terms of cinematography and acting but a complete failure as a slasher film.",1502496000,,1324,4.836283185840708

8644416,1,B00IPAORII,"If I could rate this zero stars I would.

The acting was okay but just the amount of tasteless gore was just sad.  Plus the PTSD excuse was lame.  If anything he should have had a machine gun with that excuse. Using drills and stuff was ridiculous!",1473638400,,248,4.23404255319149

8644418,1,B00IPAORII,"This entire movie was a gigantic waste of time! I was expecting a little bit of bad acting and some glorious bloodshed, but what I ultimately got was appalling acting, terrible rubbery looking FX, characters that I wanted to kill myself and just another brutish, mute, killer. The pace of this film was also very distressing it flew by at a ridiculous pace, it was literally here are the characters, here is jack, and boom they're dead. There you go you just finished the entire thing. The beginning was also completely unnecessary as well as the interlaced shots of war that I suppose was supposed to make us feel sorry for the antagonist, but really just killed the mood even further.",1433721600,2,686,4.677685950413223
8644419,1,B00IPAORII,"This piece of crap deserves no stars but unfortunately one star has to be checked to leave a review.  Please ignore the phony four and five star reviews left by the cast and crew.  They obviously aren't real.  There is no point in going into the story because there isn't one.  I hated every single character in this so-called movie and only wish they were killed five seconds into this turd so that it would end. Oh, and why do they cast thirty something morons as college students?  Since when do professional thirty year old strippers with enormous boobs inhabit your college?  They certainly weren't in mine.  This garbage plays more like a bad porn movie but without the good parts.  Actually, porn actors have more talent than these idiots.  There is absolutely no reason for this celluloid garbage to exist except to torture unsuspecting viewers.",1415923200,,853,4.787671232876712
8644420,5,B00IPAORII,"Wow what a great movie! A must see.  Also loved the sound track ""Winner"" by Legacy Feat. Too Short.",1411948800,,99,4.2105263157894735
8644421,2,B00IPAORII,"A group of students lead by Earl (Kevin James Sporman) opt to play paint ball in an abandoned hospital, because the woods is old hat. They go there and party first. Unbeknownst to them, there is a PSTD power tool killer (Quincy Taylor) located with the premise. He loathes visitors.

This is your typical slasher film. The dialogue was better than many low budget films, but needed to be kicked up a notch. The students behave in a very juvenile manner and it isn't hard to figure out who lives and who dies before the killing starts. The special effects consisted of power tools being used and blood splattering, i.e. when a guy gets drilled in the head, you don't physically see it. The severed heads are lined up almost comically on top of cardboard boxes, looking like  a row of amateur  St. John the Baptist Halloween costumes.

2 stars for the nudity.

F-bombs, sex, nudity (Aimee Bello, Deanna Meske,  Collette Walker, Ashley Walsh...thank you.)",1411171200,,952,4.739393939393939
