8257156,5,B00152MEIS,"This is an absolutely SPECTACULAR video of a Helicopter tour over these glorious islands, done with beautiful music and (Thank Heaven) a minimum of talk. The scenery is much better shot than on any other tour, and sadly, is rather nicer than the actual helicopter trip I took some months ago, thanks in large measure to the quality of this tape. If I had one criticism, it would be that my ability to decipher quickly spoken Hawaian names is pretty bad, and I wish they could print the names in the corner. I REALLY wish this was available in DVD format!",1308268800,,554,4.4950495049504955
