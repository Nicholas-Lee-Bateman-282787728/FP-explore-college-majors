7980360,3,B0000897A9,"Before I bought this item, I wanted to know if this was the complete series or just a part, and I am writing this so other people know before they buy. Nowhere in the package says whats inside besides the fact that contains 3 VHS tapes. When they showed this on TV (and I missed part of it) the whole series ran for more than 40 episodes.
This set has 3 tapes with 4 episodes each, which totals 12 episodes.
Everything else is the same other reviewers had stated. The series was fabulous, funny, original and successful. Add to that, the unending list of guest stars who were a treat in each episode they appeared. I wish the company who edited this set would do the same with the rest of the series, because 12 episodes won't do. Please, release the other 2 sets so we can enjoy the whole thing again! Thanks!
(The rating is OK due to the fact that is not the whole thing)",1304640000,,873,4.233532934131737
7980361,3,B0000897A9,"a semi funny comedy,  it suffers from limited budget it appears. The Sets and single camera shots give the series a cheap feel. Unless you know you are a true fan i would hold off on getting this dvd. As i type i am trying to find a friend that would enjoy it so that the dvd case won't take any more of my shelve space.",1260057600,,320,3.8484848484848486
