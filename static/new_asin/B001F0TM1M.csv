3558929,5,B001F0TM1M,"Watched Christmas In Wonderland on TV.  This is a great family movie.  I've pre-ordered it here on Amazon, but they aren't saying when it will be released on DVD.  I can't find any information on other websites for a release date.  Does anyone know when it will be released?",1230336000,4,274,4.530612244897959
3558930,5,B001F0TM1M,"Wayne Saunders (Patrick Swayze) is forced to leave L.A. to move to Edmonton CA. The kids get lost in the mall the youngest wants to see Santa. After visiting Santa a wish comes true they find a bag full of money. The only problem is, its counterfeit cash and the problems start, after they go on a spending spree. Its a must see movie, my family got an enjoyment out watching the movie.
We just can't figure out why it's so hard to purchase this time of season. Unless it was because it was filmed in Ca. The 2 boys Matthew Knight and Cameron Bright who played in the movie are from Canada and did a really good job of acting. What really made the movie was Amy and Zoe Schlagel playing the part of Mary Saunders, and believing in Santa and the miracles that happen. I would put this movie in the classics category Miracle on 34th Street.",1230163200,20,838,4.276729559748428

3558949,1,B001F0TM1M,"Not sure how this ever got more than 2 stars, but this movie tried way too hard to be what it is. It is full of unknown actors, with only one notable actor of whom was completely wasted as the most obnoxious excuse for an anti-hero. Don't watch this movie, even if it's free, that hour and some odd minutes of your life will be spent in bewilderment (see: First sentence of this review) and could be spent literally doing anything else. I'd rather have spent an hour using the restroom, playing candy crush (I disdain candy crush).

I understand ""suspension of disbelief"" and am not hating on this movie for being a Christmas story where (SPOILER ALERT) Santa is real, and lives in the mall. It just felt like it was made by a couple Youtube wannabe directors, with animations done in blender while on acid and juiced up on Mountain Dew.

Great alternatives to this (See: Everything except Ishtar and High School Musical) would be the Santa Clause Series, The Home Alone Series, and so on.

I'm sure many will disagree with me somehow, and that's okay, this is my review, not my attempt to be liked. If you do however watch this movie, and somehow finish it, and enjoy it, then I see no further reason for you to ever read any review ever again. Why? You're impressively open minded and easily pleased. I wish I were selling you a car.

Merry Christmas,
M.A.",1482019200,,1358,4.48582995951417

3559284,3,B001F0TM1M,Patrick Swayze was really the only thing I enjoyed about this movie.

Dad goes off to get gifts, older brother ditches and the two youngest are left to themselves. And after a trip to see Santa and the unexpected way a wish is fulfilled, the children have to learn to pull together to outwit the crooks. A charming film, especially the end.
