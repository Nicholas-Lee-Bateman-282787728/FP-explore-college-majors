3790792,3,B001TIQT70,"John Huston made quite a few great movies in his long career. This is not among his great ones.
Flannery O'Connor's career was lamentably short, she died relatively young of a disease. While she lived, she produced some stories and short novels which stand out in the genre of Southern Gothic. This is maybe her most famous book.
I don't claim that I have the foggiest notion what the good Ms. O'Connor, who could write so well without telling me much, wanted to tell us with her grotesque tale about the founder of the Church Without Jesus, but I am fairly certain that the Tennessee Waltz does not represent the right spirit for a movie version of this short novel. It just doesn't sound right. Unfortunately it is present during most of the film's duration and adds a mood that I find inadequate.

Sometimes the music moves towards slapstick and silent movies. That may be a reasonable and defendable interpretation of the text, but my instinct tells me: no way. This may be the first movie that I can recall where I would say: with a different musical score it might have worked. I can't actually recall any other movie that I disliked mainly for the music. My point is: if this story is really meant to be slapstick, then one can not put slapstick music to it. That is the same as raising boards saying 'joke!' during a sit com. My point: if O'Connor meant to be funny, which is by no means certain, she did it with a stone cold face. And that is how the movie should have done it too!

On the other hand, some things were done right, like the casting. Brad Dourif is a miracle as Hazel Motes, I would say he IS Hazel Motes. Harry Dean Stanton fits the part of Aza Hawks, the `blind' preacher, like a glove. His daughter Sabbath Lily (played by Amy Wright) is a marvel. Ned Beatty is ideal for Hoover Shoates. In other words, first class casting.
But this music! Did Huston ever listen to it?",1246233600,7,1897,4.432664756446991
3790793,4,B001TIQT70,"As his career wound down director John Huston chose some interesting projects.  He elected to tackle novels that some would call unfilmable notably Malcolm Lowrey's ""Under the Volcano"" and James Joyce's ""The Dead"".Flannery O'Connor's ""Wise Blood"" is no exception.  The story basically concerns itself with an embittered returning veteran, Hazel Motes(Brad Dourif) who has no belief system and channels his frustration by forming a ""Church without Christ"".  Motes' forum is basically a soapbox in the town square where he can vent his disorganized beliefs.  Much to his surprise Motes discovers that charlatans come in all shapes and sizes believers and non-believers alike.  The film has an interesting structure consisting of serio-comic vignettes that seemingly have no relation to one another but ultimately hang the story together.  Why I give the film slight reservation is that Motes is an enigmatic character.  What brought him to his current frame of mind?  There is a  suggestion that it was from a childhood trauma but that didn't seem to satisfy me.  Maybe it's not important to the tale that Huston is trying to spin.  Nonetheless, this is an important film from one of our finest directors.",1243036800,7,1203,5.213541666666667
3790794,5,B001TIQT70,"""WISE BLOOD"" is an overlooked jewel.

Southern writer Flannery O'Connor's first novel, ""Wise Blood,"" made it to the big screen in 1979.  The John Huston directed, low budget feature was widely praised and then practically forgotten.

O'Connor was a devout Catholic. She was also battling lupus, the sometimes debilitating immune disorder.  Both factors may have colored her novel.  Huston was a devout atheist.  His world view certainly nuanced the tone of the film.

The story concerns a somewhat troubled, perhaps damaged, youth, Hazel Motes (Brad Dourif).  Just out of the army and son of a fire and brimstone Pentecostal preacher, Motes is determined to open the first Church Withouth Christ in Taulkinham, Tennessee.

A young Brad Dourif is brilliant as the driven, vexed, Motes.  There's not a false note or a wasted frame.  His is a journey of spiritual self-exploration, penance and perhaps redemption.  O'Connor's curiosity about the southern brand of Pentecostal mind set is riveting on film.  Motes is trying to shed the damage of his ferocious religious childhood, but cannot shed his spirituality.  He finds he's a Christian in spite of himself.

Supporting actors Harry Dean Stanton, Amy Wright, Ned Beatty, William Hickey and Dan Shor are all spot on.

The frisson between director Huston's disdain for religion and O'Connor's devoutness is a perfect match.  The screenplay by brothers Benedict and Michael Fitzgerald does not stray from the core events, tone and ideas of O'Connor's story.

The obviously lower budget production, shot mostly in Macon, Georgia of the late 1970s, does not really detract, even though the novel is set in a somewhat earlier period.

The use of older, rather decayed buildings and locations amidst a more modern setting give a kind of muddy, out-of-time, appeal.  A nice visual metaphor to the theme of old fundamentalist religious views in conflict with a more progressive spirituality.

This is a unique film and story.  Hard to categorize.  For me, it's a darkly comic, decidedly gothic, tale of profound spirituality and humanism.  When the shoot was over, Huston said, ""I think I've been had.""

Criterion's transfer, as usual, is clean and  sharp.  I thought  the color was unusually true and subtle.  And the period monaural track crisp and easy on the ear.

The extras are all watchable.  The new interviews with Dourif and the  writer-producer brothers Fitzgerald are entertaining and informative.

A huge bonus is the rare recording of Flannery O'Connor reading her famous and terrific short story ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" is alone probably worth the price of the disc!  This is the only known recording of the author reading one of her stories.

There's also a wonderful vintage 1982 ""Creativity With Bill Moyers"" with director Huston.",1242172800,56,2795,5.135555555555555
3790795,5,B001TIQT70,"Finally!  John Huston's wonderful, spare adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's darkly brilliant comic novel comes to DVD.  I've loved this film since its original release -- saw it repeatedly in Paris during its first run there, where it was more successful critically than APOCALYPSE NOW or TESS -- and have tried to catch it at every (infrequent) opportunity since.  The period details are a bit off (a low budget guaranteed a bare-bones physical production), but the screenplay and direction couldn't be better.  And that cast!  A career performance from Brad Dourif as the religion-crazed Hazel Motes, marvellous supporting work from Harry Dean Stanton, Dan Shor and Amy Wright, the ideal Sabbath Lily -- and Atlanta actress Mary Nell Santacroce (mother of Dana Ivey) is unforgettable as Hazel's landlady.  O'Connor's violent, sin-soaked South is certainly not for all tastes, nor, in its fidelity to her work, is this film.  But if you respond to her vision, this picture will haunt you the rest of your life.  Hats off to Criterion for giving us another in their line of wonderful restorations.",1240358400,37,1096,5.117977528089888
3790796,5,B001TIQT70,"I am fairly new at reading/viewing works by Flannery O'Connor.  I know that I enjoy her writing tremendously and, as a writer, I enjoy studying her works - or reading them for pure enjoyment.  Thus my review on this movie will not be as well done as others who study her practically for a living.  ""Wise Blood"" takes place in Georgia, as do most of her works.  As in other stories, she incorporates her Christianity (Catholicism) in it, her humor and some real surprises I don't want to ruin.  The movie is about a young man who decides to start up a church - The Church of Jesus Without Jesus.  He believes in nothing, and tries to get others to feel the same way and join his ""church"".  He seems to still search for Jesus throughout the film.  All of the actors are good, and the casting is made even better with the inclusions of Harry Dean Stanton and Ned Beatty.  This film was made in 1979.  To purchase it as a dvd I have seen prices of $30 online.  I purchased a streaming video version for $19.99.  If no one had told me F O'Connor had written it (as a novel) I would still be able to tell after I'd seen it.

3790812,5,B001TIQT70,"John Houston's adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood is superb. It is as true to the book as is probably possible. The movie captures the dark humor and grotesqueness of the book. It's a great presentation of Hazel Mote's Church Without Christ ""where the blind don't see and the lame don't walk and what's dead stays that way.""

Houston's approach is often as stark and unusual as the book. The bluegrass Tennessee Waltz musical score is used to highlight the comedic. The actors were well chosen, with Motes, Enoch, and Asa Hawkes portrayed particularly well. Motes's haunting by the man who runs behind the trees of his mind is never portrayed explicitly, but Brad Douriff's clenched teeth delivery of many lines is used well to show the tension, fury, and anger within Motes.

The movie, though, seems closer to an ""art house"" film than one for general release, and I suspect that viewers without prior familiarity with O'Connor's novel, or at least her writings more generally, might be confused by the film and perhaps not appreciate it.

The movie is not set in the immediate post-World War II South as is the novel. Rather, it seems set in a time that is a blending of the 1950s, early 1960s, and the mid-1970s. This takes something from the story. For example, we first meet Motes returning from war, but what war?",1428883200,,1329,4.769565217391304

A soldier can return from war, believing in nothing, with anger and hatred toward the institutions that sent him to war, -- particularly if he couldn't make any sense of the killing and destruction. Ultimately, this anger, hatred and rage can destroy the veteran and all those around him if he doesn't somehow resolve the inner turmoil.

3790820,4,B001TIQT70,"Never afraid to tackle serious literature, Huston provides a lightly streamlined version of Flannery O'Connor's first novel, a true classic of modern American fiction.  Brad Dourif's performance as Hazel Motes is terrific.  The supporting cast turns in note-perfect portrayals of these odd and compelling characters.  The lamentably overlooked Amy Wright is absolutely brilliant as Lily Sabbath Hawkes.  This is a haunting and affecting story and it has been respectfully handled by Huston.

3790822,1,B001TIQT70,"If I watch a movie and think about how I would make it differently, that's a reflection on me.  Watching Wise Blood, I wanted to take the premise and rewrite the movie.  That's a bad movie.  Who knows- maybe the novel was worse.  Clumsy, pseudo-amateurish production quality.  The best actors have bit parts.  An excellent premise, but poorly written, and you can't act or direct your way out of bad writing.  John Huston should have retired 5 years earlier.

I can't say it's not worth watching, but it wasn't worth $2.99.  I'm just glad I didn't go down to Cambridge to watch it in a theatre.

**EDIT** I should be precise and say the movie starts strong, moves into a solid and promising premise, hesitates, and collapses.  The lead has a stupendous idea, but can't figure out what to do with it.  Then comes a circle of vignettes, going no where.

Go ahead and watch Wise Blood- you might make friends in the cult.",1391126400,4,918,4.524390243902439
3790823,2,B001TIQT70,"In 1979, Houston released his movie adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's first novel published in 1952. The more you know of the book, the more you can appreciate the challenge Houston faced for his adaptation. In the end, Houston's film cannot deliver the qualities of story and characters unique to O'Connor's beautifully dark writing style. Even so, if you read the book first, you will bring more to your experience with the movie and it is worth watching if only to discover what Houston misses and what O'Connor so brilliantly captures in this unusual book.

O'Connor tells the story of a young World War II veteran (son of a preacher) returning to his home town in the south. This is a story with disturbing religious themes about his crisis of faith. As the tale unfolds, O'Connor shows her unique writing style even at this early stage which is a blend of southern culture and dialogue happening in a nearly surrealistic, dream-like mixture of comedy and serious drama. Much of what O'Connor delivers in her remarkable writing between the dialogue seems to be missing from Houston's film where we can only look at the faces of characters and fill in our own version of what he or she must be thinking and feeling. Try reading O'Connor's book first, then watch Houston's movie and see if you agree.",1388793600,2,1303,4.791111111111111
3790824,3,B001TIQT70,"It is enjoyable to see the characters of one of my favorite books come to life on the screen.  However, the filmmakers seem satisfied to portray the absurdity of the story for the sake of humor alone.  I never got the impression that the filmmakers fully grasped some of the complexity behind the characters and what they are doing.  In fact, I think some of it would be near impossible to understand without the book.

Cest la vie - I find myself saying the same thing everytime a movie is made from a favorite book:  The book is better!",1386720000,2,538,4.393939393939394
3790825,5,B001TIQT70,"One time I found this movie on a tape at a video rental store, located in the ""comedy"" section.  This wasn't a mistake, in fact it was an insightful choice by the owners of the store.  Even though parts of the film are dark as night, it's all delivered with an anarchic sense of humor.  Some of Hazel Motes' sermons, delivered while standing on the hood of his beat-up '58 Ford, are side-splittingly absurd, his landlady is a comic archetype of a certain Southern mentality (without being cliched), the flirtations of the blind preacher's daughter are perfect, and, if that's not enough, there's a guy in a gorilla suit.  But it's not Monty Python humor, it's Southern humor that has a rough edge to it,  something true to a rather harsh sensibility of the times and the region.  That harshness may be off-putting to many.  I grew up around this kind of thing, and maybe it doesn't register with someone raised outside of this milieu: when I saw this in a cinema, there were two people laughing during the film--me and another guy who, it turns out, was from Georgia.

One side note, the cops in the film were not actors but real cops, and they delivered their lines with the kind of acidly sarcastic politeness tinged with menace that's true to the region and very funny to watch (when you're not on the receiving end of it).

The film ends disturbingly, but I found something very exhilarating about its darkly comic treatment of the topics of religion and salvation. It's not for everyone but I've returned to it again and again.",1383782400,3,1532,4.602941176470588

This film stayed pretty close to the book and to author O'Connors intent.  I have wondered what a novice to Wise Blood would have thought of this movie.

The music set the tone and the location in which the film was shot both contributed to the ambience of the movie and the time period.

Benedict and Michael Fitzgerald found this first novel by a Southern writer named Flannery O'Connor, jointly
wrote a script adaptation and seek out the old master John Huston to helm the film.
Due to their budgetary constraints, the film was set in the modern day(70's) but filming locations, the production design,
the costume and the extras the filmmakers put the film together reinforced the agelessness of the film.
This is Brad Dourif's career performance, right after his Oscar nominated role in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".
The rest of the supporting cast was also perfect, including the real life local prostitute.

He winds up angry, without sympathy for others, and worse (more detail w/be a spoiler).  Since the book's author, Flannery O'Connor was a devout Catholic, I'm guessing part of her intent was to warn that this is not a good state of mind in which to pursue sprirtual goals.

3790837,4,B001TIQT70,"You have to give John Huston kudos for taking on a work of Flannery O'Connor, mainly because of the difficulty of making the grotesque, bizarre Southern gothic flavor work on the big screen. I was hesitant about viewing the film, mainly because I didn't want the film to be subpar in comparison to the book. I have to say that Huston is quite imaginative in bringing Wise Blood to life, and, while the film is not an all-encompassing deliverance of the novel, the film's actors who portray the eccentric characters in the book give the film much credibility. Over all, it was an impressive performance and artistically produced. It is a necessity to have read the book prior to seeing the film to make sense of the plot. With Flannery O'Connor, there is a backwards way to presenting a moral (although she often said there were no morals to her story), and so, you have to count on a world of hypocrites, liars, thieves, and other degenerates to make sense of life. A symbolism works throughout that the viewer interprets, and this gives Wise Blood an extra dimension while watching. For instance, there are many false preachers running throughout that epitomize the negative aspects to attempting to attain faith; this is something Hazel comes to terms with.  Hazel Motes, despite his fight against faith and religion, has no soul until he sees the light of salvation in the movie's second portion, although this is even an ambiguous event that could be interpreted several ways. Although he intimates that he has no such faith at any point, we can judge for ourselves if this is true.

As far as the characterization, a superb job was done assembling a cast that breathes some life into the film and makes it visually comparable to the book. Brad Dourif completely embodies Hazel Moates in expression, angst, and rebelliousness; if there was one blemish, it was that the novel's Hazel had even more detachedness from the world in comparison with the film. The question of redeeming oneself is a central issue in Wise Blood, and the many fakes (Asa Hawkes, the false dried up mummy, Sabbath, Gonga the Giant Monarch, the ""false"" version of Hazel) within the story evoke feelings of people lost and without conscience or faith in anything, incapable of being redeemed. Even Hazel's false life is poignantly jolted in the scene where the sheriff pulls him over and says ""I just don't like your face."" His false life is seen though, and while Hazel has an immense preoccupation with what it takes or doesn't take to be ""redeemed"" or have ""wise blood"", many other characters could care less one way or another. In typical O'Connor manner, there is a irrationally rational message, and director Huston captures the very essence of this.

Fantastic film and DVD, and there is a rare gem included in the package, a recorded version of Flannery O'Connor's short story ""The Life You Save May Be Your Own.""

Glad I checked this one out!

3790838,5,B001TIQT70,"While O'Connor's original book appears to be motivated primarily by Katholisch schadenfreude, the resultant movie here could hardly be any more surrealist.  Huston was an agnostic, so I suspect that was the intent, at least at first-- but the included interview with Dourif suggests Huston may actually have initially misunderstood O'Connor's intent (an understandable mistake, if you're not Catholic), and then corrected it after some discussion with O'Connor's representatives.  In any event, as high surrealism, it's quite enjoyable.  As a religious parable, I wouldn't expect too much from it.",1278720000,2,597,5.685393258426966

3790840,5,B001TIQT70,"I've read that to understand Wise Blood one must read its source material, the novel by Flannery O'Connor. I didn't read this until after watching the film and prior to doing so had never heard of O'Connor or her novel. While the novel may assist in one's understanding of the film, I feel a second viewing of the film would serve a similar purpose...And I do plan on seeing the film again. While I may not have read the book and feel I do have more to understand about the film, Wise Blood is a film that came as a complete surprise to me. The film is directed by the legendary John Huston, whose filmography consists of several masterpieces...I've at least heard of many of them, but I hadn't heard of this film until The Criterion Collection released it some time ago. I didn't have high expectations for the film, but found the film only deepening my respect for Huston as a filmmaker.

Brad Dourif plays Hazel Motes, a wide-eyed man returning home from the Army. When he finds his family home abandoned, he buys some new clothes and sets off to do things that ""ain't ever been done before."" His new clothes make him look like a preacher and he finds himself frequently mistaken for one, but he's quick to clarify he's not a preacher...Hazel hates preachers in fact. Soon, Hazel meets Asa Hawks (Harry Dean Stanton) a supposedly blind, snake-like preacher and his nymphet daughter Sabbath Lily (Amy Wright). Hazel seems to be running from the idea of religion, but always crashing head-on into it. Finally, Hazel begins preaching the ""truth without Christ.""

It's a strange plot, yes...But it's worth noting that the film, while centered on religion, doesn't seem like a religious film. In fact, much of it plays like satire. Through his story, Hazel encounters all sorts of characters that could only exist in fiction, characters played by a perfect cast at the very top of their game. I don't recall ever seeing Dourif in a better role; he plays Motes wide-eyed, nervous, and with pent-up rage and religious fervor always about to bubble over the surface. It's certainly a career best for the man. Ned Beatty (in a small role) is delightfully sleazy, while Stanton is perfectly believable as the false preacher. Even Dan Shor impressed me with his performance as the child-like Enoch Emory.

Huston was not a director that needed to be visually extravagant to make a beautiful film. Wise Blood is a great film to look at, with a postcard simplicity that is quite charming. Even the score is made up of simple folk-y music. The screenplay is by Michael Fitzgerald and Benedict Fitzgerald (who co-wrote The Passion of the Christ, which may make you see this film differently) and what a wonderful screenplay it is. It shifts effortlessly from quirky and funny to serious and disturbing and characters that could easily seem like stereotypes seem very human. As I said earlier in my review; I look forward to watching the film again to fully grasp the multiple dimensions of it.

The Criterion Collection has done a beautiful job with the film's transfer and I applaud them for releasing the film and (hopefully) giving it a wider audience. While I can't quite figure out whether the film is supposed to be straight-forward or some sort of social satire (maybe Huston was confused as well), my first impression has left me thinking that Wise Blood is an overlooked American classic. I can only imagine that it would grow richer with repeated viewings.

3790841,5,B001TIQT70,I have sudied Flannery O'connor's work for several years and this film is stunning in the way it  captures the author's intent. The role of Hazel Motes is perfectly cast.  He is believable in this religious transformation.  He grows from skeptic to a believer in his need for salvation. A very difficult event to describe in words and even more difficult to show on film.  This film succeeds brillantly.  It is one to be studied.,1260057600,2,429,4.666666666666667
3790842,5,B001TIQT70,"Brad Dourif gives a stellar and terrifying performance in this crazy jewel of an independent film based on Flannery O' Connor's novel ""Wise Blood"".

While it might not match the majesty of the novel, what possibly could?

Hazel Motes is an angry SOB who is determined to prove to the world that Jesus Christ is a sham.  More than that, he's out to destroy anyone who claims that Christ is indeed the Way, the Truth and the Life; he has all the maniacal zeal of a debauched decadent damning himself into sainthood.

There are frequent flashbacks to Hazel's childhood, sitting in backwoods barns and hearing about hellfire and damnation from a tall, ugly, and sinister Pentecostal preacher played by none other than director John Huston.  This man was Mote's Grandfather and he was so terrifying that in one scene young Hazel urinates all over the place.

He encounters all manner of evil and corruption as he bashes heads trying to become *the* only preacher in the South (not likely).  Encountering frauds, tricksters, and money hungry snake oil salesmen, the worst is perhaps Ned Beatty and his companion Asa Hawks (Harry Dean Stanton).  Not only do they plagiarize Hazel's demented sermons, given on the tops of cars and random streetcorners, they dare to do so for money, which really pisses Hazel off.  And Brad Dourif playing Hazel Motes--well, you wouldn't want to piss either of them off.

In reality, behind his Protestant-atheist disguise, this man is a ""Jesus Hog"" as the daughter of the ""Blind Preacher"" calls him, and a penitent in the making.  Even his treatment of his insane, monkey suit donning young friend is only another manifestation of Catholicism's burning flame drawing him near like a demented moth.  And he crashes on that flame, quite badly.  This is recommended for anyone who still concernes themselves with O' Connor's work and that raggedy, shadowy beggar who lurks in the trees and everywhere else.  Really sick and really pure.",1259712000,7,1959,4.932926829268292
3790843,4,B001TIQT70,"This movie fails to live up to the book, but it does a very good job in the attempt and is worth the time and money.  Make sure you read the book as well, if not you are only seeing half of what is available.",1255305600,,208,3.6222222222222222
3790844,3,B001TIQT70,"Bizarre, funny, complicated, disturbing, and for the most part unappealing.  Few directors would even attempt to bring this ""unfilmmable"" novel to the screen.
John Huston does just that on a shoestring budget, and the result is an eccentric cinematic baptism of seemingly misguided spirituality, Evangelicalism, and contradictions.

Hazel Motes (Brad Dourif) steps off the Army bus with a bold plan--start an Atheist church.  A place ""where the blind don't see and the lame don't walk and what's dead stays that way.""  He is one intense, angry little dude.  He's ready to shout out his opposition of religion to anyone who will listen.
Now, Hazel is obviously harboring some inner demons.  I expected to see some flashbacks or references to some of his war experiences.  Maybe he lost a friend or something.  But this story offers no easy explanation for his lack of faith.

This does present quite a collection of other characters as well.  A fake blind preacher and his promiscuous daughter, a kid fixated on a mummy at the museum, some fella in a gorilla suit, plus a rival underhanded prankster who continually preaches on Hazel's turf.  Quite a crew.

I guess Wise Blood is a religious parable.  But it seems more about a state of mental and moral awareness.  It doesn't try to sway one's religious beliefs either way, as everyone comes off as batcrap crazy.  Even though I normally do love weird movies, I wish I could rate this ambitious and overwrought tale a little higher.  Hell, this even brought some unexpected laughs(a man getting viciously ran over by a car?).  But in the end, it left me feeling a little flat and uninspired.

A well-made movie for people with messed up tastes.",1248652800,6,1694,4.863636363636363
3790845,5,B001TIQT70,"John Huston sets this adaptation of Flannery O'Connors Wise Blood not in the sin-soaked South of the early-twentieth century but in the present. This may have been due to budgetary constraints but Huston makes virtue of necessity and the result is a film that looks like it grew right out of the decaying streets of Anytown, America circa the late-1970's. The result is offsetting at first, because in this translation the story is less about religion and more about an America that has lost its unifying vision (if indeed it ever had one). Therefore, thematically, Huston's Wise Blood squares nicely with many other American films from the 69-81 Vietnam and post-Vietnam era like Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy, Bogdanavich's The Last Picture Show, Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop, Altman's Nashville, Malick's Days of Heaven, and Forman's Ragtime.

As the beginning credits roll we are treated to a series of beautiful black and white photographs which serve as evocations of an older America but one that in some ways still exists and lives on in the old run-down parts of town and in the old run-down neighborhoods even as a new America tries to re-invent itself and erase its ties to its sin-soaked past. Wise Blood is about American history and identity in a time of national crisis, but Huston does not emphasize the Vietnam War as the source of this crisis, rather he underplays it and instead chooses to focus simply on a lack of a substantive vision (religious, artistic, or otherwise) to lend coherence to the chaos that is America not just in the seventies but in all times and places.

To a certain extent this adaptation does feel like a loyal adaptation in so far as the characters are all lonely outcasts prey to visions and dreams that promise salvation but only bring about further destruction, and so they are all, despite their efforts, always on the verge of mental and spiritual collapse. This is certainly a vision of life that is everywhere present in William Faulkner and Nathaniel West and Tennessee Williams and Flannery O'Connor and Truman Capote and in countless other Southern writer's fictions, but its also the vision of many a writer not from the South. Huston was a big fan of Irish literature and it is also the vision of Joyce whose ""The Dead' was adapted by Huston in 1987, and Beckett, as well as English writer Malcolm Lowry whose Under the Volcano was adapted by Huston in 1984. Huston is interested in the specifics of American history and identity but the film he creates addresses not just an American but a world-wide malaise.

Brad Dourif does a tremendous job as Hazel Motes. He plays Hazel as a tortured and lost soul desperately trying to free himself from America's long history of evangelical chicanery (Vietnam being just one example of something America has done using religion as a rationale). Hazel believes not in Jesus which only clouds peoples thinking and fools them into believing things they would be better off not believing, but in science which allows for a clear view of both the past and the future. But Hazel just can't get his preacher father or other preacher figures (one of which is played by Harry Dean Stanton and another by Ned Beatty) out of his mind or off of his conscious, as it were, for he's got a mighty guilty conscious even though he knows America's sins are not his own. He can't stand the superstition of religion and the way men use it to manipulate other men and yet it seems like everyone is either desperate to preach or deperate to be preached to if only to assuage the sense of being alone and lost.

Hazel wants only to believe in material reality and tangible things like his old car which he thinks is all a man needs to live his life, but he just can't altogether shake the pull of the religious life which has the power (or at least offers the promise) to lure and transport the soul and not just the material body. In the end Hazel Motes becomes not a preacher but an otherworldy saint who has rejected the world and all ties to it. Whether this is a personal failure or a triumph is up to the viewer to decide.",1247529600,21,4102,4.6930555555555555
8341605,5,B001TIQT70,"I don't normally bother with ""Customer reviews"" on here but this is a great film and I despair of the 1/5 star reviews I see on its Amazon Video page. I saw the film on Criterion DVD in college, bought it, and it was the first film I showed in my Faith & Cinema Chiron Studies (student-taught) course in Spring 2011. In so many ways, John Huston's blackly-farcical comedy touches on the many things - good and bad - in religion as depicted in Flannery O'Conner's novel and Brad Dourif and Harry Dean Stanton are great as two different kinds of religious hucksters simply looking for a buck to be made in their followings.
