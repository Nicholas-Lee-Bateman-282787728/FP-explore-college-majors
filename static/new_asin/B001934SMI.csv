8271747,5,B001934SMI,"We own several episodes of this show but this is my family's favorite. There are 3 episodes total, however, 2 of them are a two part special of an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. In the first two episodes Annie is elected president of the drama department and instead of choosing the traditional A Christmas Carol she chooses I'm Dreaming of a Galactic Christmas which makes a few waves. She's determined to make this a success even though her forceful attitude turns everyone against her and nearly drives off her best friend Zach who tries again and again to make her see reason. Annie loses her Christmas spirit completely, can her friends help her see the spirit of Christmas or is she doomed to be a Scrooge?
In the final episode Annie and Zach have collected cans for a food drive and decide they've done such an awesome job that a day should be held in their honor. Plato tells them stories to help them understand that when we donate it is best done in secret. This episodes includes the age old Gift of the Magi, a tale about selfless giving. It really is the only cartoon I've ever found with lessons on charity and humility at the same time.",1450310400,,1170,4.523584905660377

Good story line for one of the important characters!",1376956800,,116,4.85
8271752,4,B001934SMI,"I went through a lot of changes to finally get this, no one has it and we saw the first half of this episode and never saw the end. Finally thanks to amazon we got is right before Christmas, great ending, nice to see the value and priorities discussed. I also has a few other little episodes included.",1356480000,,301,4.206896551724138
8271753,2,B001934SMI,"I am a big fan of William Bennett's Book of Virtues series, and I was hoping that these videos would provide a nice compliment to the printed books.  Although the stories were sweet, they were also sort of sappy.  Plus the different stories told within one episode seemed (to my kids) to be rambling and unconnected (although an adult would know that they shared a moral point).  Worst of all, the dialogue was stilted and the voices of the children were just awful -- sounded like grownups pretending to be kids.  The voices were so bad that my kids were laughing at the characters and complaining that they were ""annoying.""  Just not as entertaining and engaging as I had hoped.  Sort of defeated the purpose of instilling some good moral values in an entertaining and engaging format.",1323388800,,787,4.708029197080292
8271754,4,B001934SMI,"I love how complex the plots are in this version of ""A Christmas Carol.""  There's the original ""Christmas Carol,"" which Annie and her friends were accustomed to performing as a play each Christmas season; there's the play Annie insists that they perform instead; and there's the plot revolving around the conflict between Annie and the other young people, who would rather put on the original ""Christmas Carol.""

This is a version I'll watch again and again for years to come!",1235520000,3,476,4.9375
