8130354,4,B000GBEWJ8,"Life can get pretty hairy when you're a boy who finds himself unexpectedly changed into a dog occasionally.  The movie is a British comedy that follows Eric (who is about 11) and his somewhat ditzy friend as they try to figure out what keeps turning Eric into a dog while also trying to keep his unusual dual life a secret.

The movie is never fast-paced or gripping, has no shortage of trained dog tricks, and yet it's enjoyable and a bit of a lark that nicely explores the fun and embarrassment of having to spend part of one's life as a dog.",1301356800,,544,4.323529411764706
