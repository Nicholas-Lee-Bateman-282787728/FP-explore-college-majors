8319326,5,B001LPWGDM,Our two and a 1/2 year old loves the Doodlebops and this is great as it has a CD with it to take in his bedroom dance all day if he likes. It is cute and very musical.,1381276800,,167,3.4210526315789473
8319327,5,B001LPWGDM,"My 2 1/2 daughter loves this DVD and CD set.  She would probably love any Doodlebop dvd though.
The plus about this one is the CD.  When I get tired of playing the movie over and over again, I put the CD in her radio.  That is a little more pleasurable then hearing the DVD constantly.  She loves the music cd just as much as the dvd, if not more.  There is only 4 songs on the cd, but she loves it.",1275696000,,399,3.817073170731707
8319328,5,B001LPWGDM,"Fast delivery, brand new condition.  This was part of our 3 1/2 year old's Easter basket and it hasn't left the DVD player since.  She talks about it all of the time.  She learned of the Doodlebops via the Disney channel and they are no longer on in the mornings, so this has been a real treat for her.",1240272000,2,302,4.084745762711864
