But she had it on tape and I wanted to watch a good movie and she recommended it. So I  watched it........i loved EVERY minute of it!!!!My favorite character is  John Bender. And i also like Allison. I wanted to watch it again so I did,Iv  watched it 4 times. I love it so much and I think its the best movie I ever  saw,it has comedy,a little bit of romance,its sad in parts. All together its  a great movie!!!!!!I DEFINANTLY RECOMEND IT!!!In fact I think Ill watch it  right now!!",922147200,,619,4.203389830508475
55920,5,078322687X,"A great movie like this comes only once in a great while.  I mean, any kid that grew up in the 80's should own this movie.  There have been movies that have tried to show how the kids and  the school system are, but this  is the only one that shows it truely and honestly.  It takes a kid from  every group of school society, puts them in a room together along with a  jerk principal, and makes an incredible show.  This movie shows the lives  and personalities of a nerd, weirdo, prep, jock, and stoner which was not a  common group to have in one room.  It also brings back the good times of  the 80's and shows us what were missing out on.  If your to have one movie  form of the 80's, I believe that this should be the one to buy.",918604800,,734,3.972413793103448

55925,5,078322687X,A classic for all the right reasons!  Just watched this again for probably the 5th time in my life but not since 20 yrs ago and it was still so memorable and enjoyable and righteous.  Some of the lines have been become such a part of our society's vernacular that it's funny to hear it again from the source.  John Hughes was a master storyteller of the 80s-90s.,1523836800,,362,4.294117647058823

55974,5,078322687X,"This is, of course, one of the classic 80's movies. My wife wanted to watch this with our kids because she remembered loving it so much as a kid and wanted them to see it so they they would enjoy it as well. As we got into it, we remembered that the 80's were a different time for movies than now as people were able to get away with a whole lot more. And she had completely forgotten about the joint scene where they all get high. That may be fine for most of the country right now, but I'm not going to encourage my children to do drugs myself. They've got the rest of the world to do that. Even with that scene though, it's still a  great movie with plenty of classic lines and scenes to bring back all the 80's nostalgia. Worth a watch by anyone, as long as they are prepared for the differences of movies between then and now.",1515456000,6,831,4.067073170731708

55979,3,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club came out in 1985, a year after I graduated high school.  I never saw it until today.  (Well, I've been kind of busy until this afternoon.)  A lot of the dialogue just didn't feel natural to me.  I wasn't buying that these were teens.  The movie screams of manufactured teen angst.  Some of the heaviness was laughable.  Oh, poor boy got an F.  His life is over.  How dramatic.  It's not that I wish I had the 90 minutes back, I just don't think the movie is as good as the ratings would make you think.  Nostalgia wise, I guess it's pretty good.  Remember when these actors were the hot thing?  Damn the years have gone by fast.",1515196800,,647,4.24793388429752

It helped me make a connection back to what it's like.  I absolutely loved it.

Five teenagers from different high school social groups are forced together during a Saturday detention where they are forced to evaluate the wrongdoing that causes them to be there. Instead, they get a first-hand inside look into each other's troublesome lives. They're not as perfect or imperfect as they seem to be. As they sit and wait for the hours and minutes to pass by, they challenge each other's character. You have your popular girl who gets everything handed to her, the jock who succeeds in sports, the nerd who excels academically, the introvert who isolates herself and the badass who challenges authority and comes from an abusive home. Although they're all so different, they come to learn how much alike they really are.

""The Breakfast Club"" is not only a great character study but also an important film for any generation. It packs an emotional wallop with every character revelation. By the film's finale, you sincerely believe each character's growth and it leaves you with the hope that people from different walks of life can ultimately understand each other and accept each other and in the end truly be a ""club"" of friends.",1502409600,2,1195,5.005025125628141

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct? That's the way we saw each other at 7:00 this morning. We were brainwashed.

56099,3,078322687X,"Released in 1985 and written & directed by John Hughes, The Breakfast Club is a teen dramedy about five high school students from five different sub-cultures during an all-day detention over the weekend at their suburban Chicago school. Molly Ringwald plays the popular girl, Emilio Estevez the jock, Anthony Michael Hall the Brainiac nerd, Judd Nelson the dope-smoking rebel and Ally Sheedy the neurotic misfit. Paul Gleason and John Kapelos are on hand as the host principal and janitor respectively

This movie has a big reputation as an 80's teen flick, but I was wholly disappointed. Most of the discussions between the five students from different cliques come across contrived and unconvincing. Some of the dialog is actually cringe-inducing.

The hoodlum could've worked as a character, like the Fonz or Vinnie Barbarino, but he's such an annoying, loud-mouthed jerk that he loses all sympathy, particularly when he verbally rapes the redhead on multiple occasions for no ostensible reason. *** SPOILER ALERT*** The fact that the two end up together at the end adds insult to injury. ***END SPOILER*** Not to mention two others that unrealistically couple up.

It's strange that ""The Breakfast Club"" is billed as a comedy because there's very little that's funny, although it's occasionally entertaining, like some of the music sequences. Unfortunately, Hughes wasn't into the heavier side of rock and so the soundtrack consists solely of bland 80's new wave bands, like his other 80's teen flicks (e.g. Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink and Ferris Buellers Day Off). Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of quality songs, like We Are Not Alone by Karla DeVito, but where are the heavier popular bands of 1984, like Van Halen, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ratt, Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, AC/DC or Motley Crue? Is it asking too much to have ONE song that actually rocks?

But the music is the least of the movie's problems (and isn't really a problem at all, except that there aren't any heavy tracks). The actors are fine, but Hughes' dialog is unconvincing. As such, you don't buy the characters. The script needed a serious rewrite.

The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the suburbs north of Chicago.

This movie, while not a classic in any sense of the word, was a microcosm of those amazing years from 1980 to 1990. The kids of today may laugh at us who grew up back then, but for those of the 80's, it represents a period when everything just meshed together perfectly. A time that had never existed before and, sadly, may never exist again.

56111,2,078322687X,"John Hughes, the guy who created a string of teen comedies in the 80s, portrayed teenagers as whiny and self-absorbed with questionable humor.  Hughes' version of high school is always a cartoon version of adolescence.  None of the kids in this movie seem like they are really abused (except maybe Bender, but it's hard to tell), so by the time they all share their true feelings about how tough their lives are because...parents and reasons, it all falls flat.  It's no wonder Generation X got labeled as self absorbed.  Hughes and his movies do a disservice to the intelligence of teenagers of any age, but particularly to anyone who was a teenager in the 80s, when (in this movie universe) the well-off, white teenagers just have a pity party over practically nothing.",1486512000,3,771,4.818181818181818

The reason I wanted to watch it again, aside from being a great movie, was to see if a certain scene was in there. When Andy and Allison are about to go to the teacher's lounge to get drinks, there was a scene where they collected money for the sodas. The main exchange was between Bender and Brian. Andy gets money from Brian, then steps over to Bender. Bender sticks out his palm to Brian, indicating give me money. Brian, trying to be funny, slaps his hand in a low five manner. Bender then motions something and Brian gives Andy the money. Not sure why this scene has been left out of this copy and a DVD copy that I owned at one time. It's not an important scene, but I have always wondered. I even wrote the studio regarding this, but only got a generic answer related to editing for time.

56160,5,078322687X,"I remember seeing this movie when it was released in the movie theatre.  For decades I hadn't really thought about it much until I was waiting in the queue to pick up my son after school.  He's a Junior in high school and I'm sitting there in the car looking at the droves of teenagers empty out of the building.  It dawned to me.... I'm witnessing my own high school!  I'm seeing a replay of ""Breakfast Club"" all over again!  Things go in cycles.  Currently in our high schools the '80s have resurfaced.  I'm seeing guys in pastel Polo shirts, khaki shorts, top-siders with no socks and a sweater tied round their neck.  There are the 'Nerds' with their mountains of  books and Star Trek t-shirts.  Here come the ""All in Black"", heavy eyeliner, Doc Martin-wearing, angst-ridden with their heads down.  The 'metal heads' with concert t-shirts that they most likely didn't attend. There are always the 'jocks', donning letter jackets, gleaming smiles, large necks and a gaggle of gals with leggings and giggles following their every step....

When I told my son that his school is identical to my school back in the '80s, he scoffed, as teenagers do.  I asked him if he ever saw ""Breakfast Club"".  He said he heard of it but never saw it. (Mom gets on her Amazon App immediately, orders the Blu-Ray with One-Click).
A couple days later, it arrives in the mail.  I hand it over to my son and say, ""Here is your school in movie form""... With a scoff and an eye-roll added for effect, he trudges upstairs and I hear it tossed onto his desk.  Fast-forward to a Sunday and he's bored.  He graces us with his presence that Sunday afternoon and looks like he has had an epiphany!
""Mom! You're right!  That school is EXACTLY like my school!""  Sometimes Moms are right.  It happens.
I said, ""Really? No kidding? Because that was MY high school!"".
Thank you ""Breakfast Club"" and Amazon for giving me a common thread to my son!  We parents of teenagers need every nugget we can find!",1481068800,32,1971,4.542613636363637
56161,5,078322687X,"I bought this for my 16 year old. When I told him it was made 30 years ago he made a face and humored me anyway and watched it for our family movie night.  He thoroughly enjoyed it!  It's a timeless message about how hard it is to be a teen and surviving all the pressures (peer, family, school) and other issues they face daily. It goes to show that high school life isn't so unique to one generation and this movie is just as relevant today as it was 30 years ago.",1480809600,6,466,4.0

56203,5,078322687X,"Quintessential teen angst movie still as relevant today as it was in 1985 when it was released. It is textbook style must-see for anyone who parents or works with teens.

While it has been reviewed as a story about teens coming together from five different high school ""cliques,"" that shortchanges the impact of the film. A ""clique,"" the way they used to be conceived of, is just a group of teens who have a lot in common and therefore don't really relate to other teens outside their group.

What this film so ably reveals is the deeper sense of connection teens have from trying to survive in a world where the adults make and enforce the rules of society. Biologically teens are really adults. Societally they are still children. As biological adults/societal children they are not equipped to live successfully in the adult world. Yet at the same time they have all these adult impulses: a sense of their own power, potential, abilities, increasing libido, etc.

All the while adults are usually interacting with teens in one of three ways: trying to live as if they are still teenagers, or trying to control outcomes for the teens in their lives, or being blissfully ignorant of the profound vulnerability most teens feel. Any adult who cares enough to intervene tends to try to control outcomes. This is partially due to a real wisdom that comes from being on the inside of making societal rules and understanding them. However, teens have a relatively myopic understanding of the rules without having any internalization for the reasons for which they exist. Hence, the angst. Most feel abandoned by the adult world and, in order to psychologically survive with any sanity intact, they form highly-bonded groups that function more like families with their own rules. Way beyond the concept of ""cliques"" in intensity, these bonds are airtight.

You see the intensely-bonded cluster-groups (which function more like family than any ""clique"" would) come to the fore in the climax of the film as the teens sit in a circle in the library discussing why they had detention that day. I won't offer any more ""spoiler"" info than that. Just when you see the film watch for key descriptions of and/or any actual interaction with adults (ONLY one of which seems to be on the right trajectory to being the kind of adult we should all strive to be for the teens in our lives). Also, watch for how they form their own ""cluster-group"" (must credit Chap Clark and his book ""Hurt"" for this concept and much of what I said in this review). How quickly the bond develops within one day! And yet, they all feel the tension of whether the bond will remain intact.

Having said all this, be prepared for some colorful language and sundry other vulgarities. All-in-all, as someone who has worked with teens for over 35 years, I cannot stress enough how much this film is must-see for anyone who cares enough about teens to be positively impacting their lives at a heart level.",1476316800,,2959,4.771484375

56249,5,078322687X,"Universal have reissued Breakfast club on blu-ray again 2nd time
but this time they're advertising it as 30th Anniversary edition
and for this 30th birthday version Universal have re-fixed the HD transfer from the previous blu-ray version
and Universal definitely have in my opinion,
the picture quality does look excellent very nice sharp & clear picture in 1:85:1 ratio
much better than the old Digital remaster dvd that's for sure
plus the sound quality has been slightly boosted up to 5.1 master mix, still better sounding than the old Dolby digital mix
as for the extras, yes Universal have done the correct thing
and carried over all the special features from the old Flashback edition dvd
the retrospective Doco from the flashback dvd is the same Digital remaster picture quality
the brat pack featurette is the same, the audio commentary has been carried over to
Universal have also reissued the Breakfast club, sixteen candles & weird science
in 3 Disc blu-ray set called JOHN HUGHES YEAR BOOK COLLECTION
all 3 Discs are exactly the same as the Individual blu-ray versions, the only Difference is the packaging
so definitely time to upgrade buy this new 30th blu-ray reissue, 5 stars for it",1471478400,10,1199,4.970149253731344

56280,5,078322687X,"The most timeless film of the Hughes / Ringwald / Brat Pack era, and clearly the most serious, personal work of the director's career. The Breakfast Club is an up-close, introspective look at five essentially disparate souls who share one cramped Saturday together in detention and, along the way, discover there's much more to their peers than what they wear and who they hang with. Reminiscent of theater, much like the closed-room classic 12 Angry Men, this isn't a flashy picture but it really doesn't need to be. This film rides entirely on the strength of its authentic, revealing dialog and the astonishingly mature, resounding performances of its cast, who contribute many of the sharpest, most memorable lines via ad-lib. It's about trust (or lack thereof), pushing others' buttons, being honest with oneself, testing new boundaries and revealing a shared, deep-seated uneasiness about the perilous approach of adulthood and its inherent responsibilities. Emotions run high at this age, and they respect no class distinctions. The cast may be extremely small, but it delivers across the board; Judd Nelson's damaged loner, Ally Sheedy's bashful antisocial, Anthony Michael Hall's over-stressed bookworm, Emilio Estevez's high-strung jock, Molly Ringwald's pretentious priss. Each role a potential career-maker, and not a missed note in the bunch. It's an existential essential, a notice to uncertain adolescents that somebody understands, and a reminder to their grown-up counterparts that they, too, were once just as troubled.",1468281600,,1537,5.489451476793249

Brief overview of bonus features:

+  commentary with Judd Nelson, anthony michael hall, and a moderator(forgot name).  Informative and funny, it's worth a listen as the 2 stars easily go from joking around to giving serious input about the film with lots of compliments towards their director.
+  12-pt documentary.  Quick paced series of featurettes with an emphasis on all the characters.  Entertaining and worth a watch.  Ally sheedy and the guy who plays the janitor(forgot his name) contribute to the documentary along with hall and Nelson.  I guess the jock and princess were too cool or busy to show up:)
+  featurette on the origin of the term ""brat pack"" used to describe the up & coming 80s stars.
+  ""all new"" feature length trivia track.  I haven't seen/read this one yet.  If I were a bigger fan of the movie I would probably sit through it once.
+  theatrical trailer

Overall, good movie about kids who wouldn't give each other the time of day if they saw one another in the hallway.  But due to them being forced to interact with each other because of detention(except for one who apparently showed up just for fun), they find out they have more in common then they thought.  Overall, good coming of age movie, really good dvd with lots of extras, and one great song to bookend the film.  There's your 5 stars.",1463961600,,1580,4.5587188612099645

The casting, writing, producing/directing and song choices couldn't of been more perfect.  Think about the simplicity of the plot where you make a movie that follows a group of kids sitting in the library for Saturday detention.

Today this movies just simply couldn't be made.  There's nothing blowing up every 3 minutes or frames that literally average 2-3 seconds before the new angle view pops up.

Director John Hughes did some of the most popular teen '80s movies of the decade. Yeah, I was there practically from the get go turning 13 in November 1979. I virtually saw all of it, the movies, the styles, the changes, President Reagan, all the tragedies we had in the decade, the celebs, etc. Life goes on. For me, it was a good decade of which I have fond memories to this day.
This movie is about 5 students that have to spend 8 hours of detention at their high school on a Saturday. They come from all the student ""classes"" on campus, supposedly anyway. But the idea behind the movie is the students go in really not knowing too much of themselves. Over the course of the time spent with each other talking, they finally know more about each other and themselves like never before. THAT is the plot or idea in the movie. To come out of your comfort zone or ""walled existence"" and really see for yourself who you really are.
Universal has done an outstanding job on this Blu-ray edition! It is fully RESTORED to brilliance and detail. I am really happy about that. If only the company did that to ""16 Candles"" and ""Weird Science"".

56677,5,078322687X,"In my opinion, The Breakfast Club is one of the best classics of all time. This is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. Sure, some might find it pretty boring if they're not into the kind of movie that has five strangers who are in a Saturday Detention and they have to write an essay on who they think they are. They're classified as The Athlete, The Princess, The Brain, The Basketcase, and The Criminal. They get to know each other and there's even a bit of romance that blossoms between a few of them. I believe it's a John Hughes film, so that right there should be enough reason to watch the movie. Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy are only part of the amazing cast that help make the movie so great!",1447372800,,766,4.401408450704225

Now that I'm middle-aged, watching the Breakfast Club again was fun and nostalgic, but was certainly not as deep as I remembered it. Absolutely worth the time, and my European partner who had never seen it was entertained as well.

The biggest negative though - it was hard to resist the urge to shake my fist and yell ""you damned kids get off my lawn!""",1447027200,,547,4.300970873786408

56749,4,078322687X,"So here's the thing - if I'd rated this movie based on how I felt about it when I was a teenager and young adult, it would have gotten five stars.  If I'd seen it for the first time as an adult, I would have given maybe two stars.  My reason has nothing at all to do with the storytelling and everything to do with the fact that I now have a teenager.  Honestly, when I watched it as an adult, every sexual reference made by kids my son's age immediately made me cringe.  And the principal - when I was a teenager, I saw him as such a villain.  As an adult, I just think, dang, it sucks that he's got to be at work on a Saturday! doing nothing but babysitting a bunch of disrespectful malcontents.  I feel like I'm going to have to write 19 year-old me an apology note for this, but I actually felt more sympathy for the principal than for anyone else in the movie.  Then, when the scene between Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald came up (if you've seen the movie, you know the one I'm talking about!), I actually just turned the movie off.  Maybe when my son is 20 and no longer the same age as these kids, I'll be able to enjoy it again.

57202,4,078322687X,"I've been slowly starting to watch John Hughes teen comedies of the 1980's because they seem much more realistic than the teen comedies that dot the landscape today. That being said, I considered throwing the I Quit towel into the ring about an hour into the film thinking that I was too young to feel what fans of The Breakfast Club failed to see in this flick. That it was nostalgia that granted this film the ""classic"" status that it has achieved in some circles. I couldn't for the life of me understand why I should care that the jock, the popular girl, the criminal thug, the nerd, and the loner were in detention together...

Then came the final half hour and the pieces magically fall into place because we learn that these people who we think are SO DIFFERENT are really struggling with many of the same issues--abuse, pressure put on by parents, etc. and these revelations are like a wall coming down as they themselves realize that they are not so different. I also appreciated that John Hughes sort of left the ""What Happens on Monday"" question hang in the air (at least in the movie), do they go back to their cliques as though nothing has happened or do they become friends bending the rules of the grand high school hierarchy?

The great thing about John Hughes films is that he almost always leaves something to the viewer's imagination. I don't think that one has to necessarily like the characters in this movie, for example Bender comes across as a jerk, but even in the jerk, there is something deeper that one can identify with. I even found myself to an extent identifying with Principal Vernon, even if I didn't agree with his tactics.

I found 1/3 of the film to be a powerful film about how our perceptions of people may bind us to believe certain stereotypes, but it also provided some hope that we can move beyond our stereotypes, even if its' unclear whether these will survive the pressures of the real world.",1430265600,3,1938,4.563218390804598

Would have been nice to have a round robin interview with all of the Breakfast Club today to reflect, or a new commentary with all of them at the same time (even a video commentary).",1427932800,5,810,4.2064516129032254
57306,4,078322687X,"Good movie for parents to watch with their teens or pre-teens.  Reinforces the ideas found in a talk and paper given by Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone many years ago on ""How young men influence the girls who love them""(from Redbook,July 1965), and summarizing that young boys are looking for sex while young girls are looking for love. Boys will give love to get sex and girls will give sex to get love. And the negotiation begins. It also points out how parents by their own behavior or lack of good parenting influence their children in negative ways. This movie is an excellent teaching opportunity.  Although it may have been nice to include something about the hazards of this early ""negotiation"" in young teens. Too many youn teen girls have fallen prey to the idea that ""It's ok if you love him.""",1427760000,,800,4.666666666666667

57308,3,078322687X,"If there was ever a Hollywood-backed film personifying the anxiety of Generation X, it was ""The Breakfast Club"". If you were a teen in suburban America in the 1980's (as I was), this was your film, or at least it was supposed to be. The Boomers had ""The Graduate"" and ""Easy Rider"", the Silent Generation had ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""American Graffiti"". We have ""The Breakfast Club"". Or do we? Is it a cinematic masterpiece or overrated? Let's take a second look at this cult classic because as of this writing, the 30th anniversary of its release is coming up in 2015 with theatrical viewings scheduled around the country. Generation X'ers will be lining up to relive their teenage years.

While in his 30's, John Hughes had a brief directing career making films targeted to Generation X'ers. Hughes offerings were considered the fresh new voice speaking both to and from the point of view of Generation X, offspring of the sons and daughters of those who were children during and just after World War II, a.k.a the Silent and Baby Boom Generations. Hughes also directed ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and ""Pretty in Pink"". Many of Hughes' films used the same talent. These youthful upstarts of our generation were fondly known as ""The Brat Pack"". (Some of the ""brat"" actors transitioned into adult careers while others fell off the radar.) Among Hughes' favorite talent were Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy, all present and accounted for in ""Breakfast Club"". By 1991, the Generation X'ers were becoming young adults, graduating from college and beginning careers and families. The voice of 80's teen angst was becoming pass. Hughes directed his last film in 1991, ""Curly Sue"", which paired a Boomer and a Millennial with disastrous results. It ultimately bombed at the box office.

So does ""Breakfast Club"" uphold today? Well sort of yes sort of no. There is no plot per se, only a setting. The setting is the high school library where five teenagers are being held in a day-long detention on a Saturday for wrong-doings which are never made completely clear. The real story is about each character and how they get to know one another. The film's strength is also its weakness, depending upon your point of view. Each student comes from a different aspect of the student body of the fictional high school. They are in essence, prototypes, maybe even stereotypes, of each of the different faces of the school. Molly Ringwold is from the ""popular"" and chic crowd of girls who wear makeup and nice clothes. Judd Nelson is the rule-breaker, who we imagine never does his homework and goofs off at the back of the classes he takes if he's not cutting school altogether. Even from the get-go, we predict that this is not Nelson's first time in detention. Emilio Estevez is the jock, probably a football player and wrestler. Ally Sheedy is the loser loner female, who at first grosses out Ringwold. Anthony Michael Hall plays ""the brain"", a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the ""popular"" crowd.

The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.

Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the ""must-see"" film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous ""dance scene"" where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.

""The Breakfast Club"" may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen ""The Graduate"", ""American Graffiti"", and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does ""The Breakfast Club"" do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.",1427760000,4,5648,4.701010101010101

The disk player itself makes more bizarre sounds while trying to process this disk than any before it.  If you stop the disk after you start the movie, it goes right back to the very beginning of the whole process - if you pause it too long, it goes back to the very beginning as well.  I have blu-ray disks that ask me if I want to continue watching from three months ago, so I know this disk is different.  If you actually get to the movie, and don't mind watching it from beginning to end with no bathroom breaks or trips to the kitchen, you'll be fine.

57427,4,078322687X,"In high school, which one were (or are) you? One of the popular kids, a jock, a disturbed misfit, a hood/criminal, or a nerdy brain? These days there are a few more sub-categories, but writer-director John Hughes pretty much nailed the stereotypes back in 1985. And though they're stereotypes, as one cast member stressed they're not caricatures. Thats a big reason why The Breakfast Club became such an instant classic film about teenagers and their problems. The other reason is that Hughes captured the way teens talk, and he made sure that his script worked by allowing his young actors to ad lib.

Hughes Brat PackEmilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Judd Nelsondid a lot of that, as youll discover if you choose to watch the digitally remastered and fully restored (from hi-res 35mm original film elements) 30th Anniversary Blu-ray with pop-up trivia cards. Its a great way to experience a film that looks terrific with the new transfer, even if the cards linger on the screen a little long (have reading levels dropped that much since 1985?).

Entertainment Weekly called The Breakfast Club the best high school movie of all time, and the R ratingfor language (including F-bombs), sex talk, and marijuana usehasnt stopped generations of teens from watching it. Lets be honest. Parents know that kids talk this way, or else they hear kids talking this way every day at school. And Hughes captures that part of the culture where everything revolves around the teen and his or her standing among peers. So let your teens watch, if they want. Its nothing they haven't seen before.

Does it still hold up? Yes and no. The Breakfast Club remains one of the definitive movies about teens, but if your teen is caught up in the thumb-tapping world of hand-held gaming and texting, there might be a little too much talking to suit them. Thats the whole premise:  five kids arrive at school for an eight-hour Saturday detention because of something they did. So as different as these kids know they are from each other, they still have that in commonand its a start. The rest of the film ebbs and flows in what feels like real time (though its obviously compressed) with taunts, accusations, skirmishes, run-ins with the principal in charge of detention, bonding moments of dancing and drug use, soul-baring confessions, laughing, crying, and attempts to get to know each other that begin half-heartedly but soon grow sincere. Sometimes it gets a little melodramatic; then again, so do teens.

This group walks eight hours in each others shoesin one scene, quite literallybut in the end were not sure that much will have changed when they return to school on Monday. They do gain some insight into the lives of people who are radically different from them, at least, and thats something we need a lot more of.

Language:  6-8 F-bombs and other cursing
Sex:  POV upskirt shot and talk about whos a virgin, getting laid, etc.
Violence:  A few skirmishes, but nothing really
Adult situations:  Just talk, mostly
Takeaway:  Misfits are people too

57503,4,078322687X,"The brilliance of ""The Breakfast Club"" is largely lost on those who think of it as a teen movie about high school archetypes. It's not a movie about a rebel, a princess, a jock, a freak, and a nerd; there are no such people. It is, apologetically, a high-concept play about people trapped in a room until they realize that their similarities are greater than their differences. It rips up Moliereliterallyand adorns itself with the clothes and music and fresh faces of the era's key movie-going demographic, but preserves the close character work, human insight, and polished bon mots of a ""serious"" work for stuffy theater-goers. Among the people who didn't notice the script's incredible energy and sophistication were the voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who failed to nominate the script for Best Original Screenplay though it is worthy of favorable comparison with the likes of ""12 Angry Men"" and Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit."" Similarly, the Academy failed to recognize the accomplishment of Ally Sheedy, who completely transformed herself from the sunny girlfriend of ""WarGames"" (1983) into the impish, shocking, hilarious Allison of ""The Breakfast Club."" Audiences focused more on Molly Ringwold's girl-next-door appeal, but she is slightly miscast as an alpha female and her screen presence pales next to Sheedy's show-stealing talent. Perhaps most damning of the Academy's ability to recognize quality when it comes in the guise of a popcorn movie is the lack of an acting nomination for Judd Nelson, who shows incredible range and depth as Bender. Nelson underplays and overplays in exactly the right places as Bender's determination to speak painful truths drives the film and sets off chain reactions within the ensemble. More snubs at Oscar time included the film's tense, cerebral score, and the songs that make up its now-iconic soundtrack of 80s pop picked to play during the beginning, end, and the choreographed montages that break what could be a one-act play into a traditional three-part structure. Some might criticize the montages for being silly, dated, and disconnected from the plot, and they would be right, but the segments are fun and they let each character reveal his or her nature in a non-verbal context by the particular way that they dance on banisters and slide down hallways. The only really indefensible missteps in ""The Breakfast Club"" come near the end, and the timing sours the experience. The makeover scene is hokey and regressive, a too-easy climax that was perhaps meant to suggest the mutability of image and the multiplicity of the individual, but that comes across as a defense of conformity. A related impulse to pair the characters off is unearned in at least one case and arguably both. The Anthony Michael Hall character's arc is too derivative of Billy Bibbit's in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" though the stakes are already high enough without being raised to life and death. After all, the really interesting question presented by the film is not whether these kids will live, but how they will live. That said, ""The Breakfast Club"" is not the only work of genius to botch an ending. Oscar voters, like Assistant Principle Vernon, saw only what they wanted to see and missed the chance to enshrine it in the canon. Popular opinion and critical consensus have been less blind.",1423094400,6,3361,5.046762589928058

57542,5,078322687X,"I have a soft spot in my heart for the movies of the '80s -- ""The Blues Brothers,"" ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off,"" ""Wargames,"" ""Back to the Future,"" etc.  Somehow the films of this era feel more ""real"" and ""honest"" than modern cinema, with actors who could be comedic without feeling fake or over-the-top and an overall feel to said movies that seemed more realistic and less contrived than most modern films.  Granted, many of these films have become classics while other films of the '80s have fallen into obscurity, but there's a reason they've endured as classics, and I would rather re-watch one of these films than suffer through another mindless ""comedy"" put out by Hollywood's current crop of actors and directors.

""The Breakfast Club"" is a rather dark comedy/drama, especially in contrast with John Hughes' usual body of work.  But it's still a poignant and unflinching look at high school and its cliques, and how youth are shaped by their parents, teachers, and other adults... for better or for worse.

It's Saturday at a Chicago high school, and five students have shown up for a full day of detention for various infractions of the rules.  They represent a variety of traditional high school cliques -- Andrew, a star wrestler and the quintessential jock; Brian, a quiet but well-meaning young genius; Claire, an aloof and slightly snobbish prom queen and popular girl; Bender, a foul-mouthed rebel who constantly butts heads with the school principal who oversees the detention; and Allison, a silent and eccentric artist who occasionally acts out for attention.  At first the five students bicker and hassle one another, chafing under the jerkish principal's vigil and finding ways to push one another's buttons.  But as hijinks ensue and secrets, pasts, and revelations come to light, the students realize they have far more in common than they realized... and the lines between cliques are never as clear-cut as they seem.

Writer/director John Hughes is know for having a fairly light tone in his movies -- ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" etc. -- so ""Breakfast Club's"" darker and even bleak tone may come off as a shock to those used to his sillier comedies.  But this tone works for this particular movie, as it's not afraid to deconstruct the typical high school comedy and the various stereotypes that tend to populate said comedies.  And it probes deeper into what shapes and influences teenagers than most teen movies do, even if the picture it paints isn't very pretty -- as characters in the film say, ""Are we all going to grow up to be like our parents?"" and ""When you get older, your heart dies.""  That's not to say the movie isn't without its funny moments, though -- it still elicits plenty of laughs, even if the mood sometimes whiplashes between light and dark and some of the humor is of the ""black comedy"" variety.

The acting in this film is pretty strong as well.  It stars members of the ""Brat Pack,"" a group of young actors especially popular in the '80s -- Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Michael Hall.  All of them slip into their respective roles almost effortlessly, and bring genuine pathos to their characters.  It would have been all too easy for them to fall into the usual stereotypes, but here even the characters that should be unlikable, like Nelson's foul-mouthed and belligerent Bender, are made sympathetic and relatable.  Paul Gleason is deliciously unlikable as the harsh and slightly corrupt Principal Vernon, but I found the janitor character (pretty much the only other notable character in the movie) to be somewhat forgettable.

A well-deserved classic, far more honest and in-depth than most other teen movies.  Probably best for ages 15 and up due to swearing, drug use, sexual conversation, and a very blatant (but funny) panty shot.",1420416000,11,3860,4.938176197836167

I was the football and track athlete in high school, so I fall under the jock character even though I was also good in the class room. I graduated from high school in 1985 in New York City and the Breakfast Club is truly how high school was in the 1980's. This was truly a magical time in my life and I watch it every few months to go back down memory lane. I sometimes feel sorry for the youths of today because I just don't see them having as much to look back on as we did. These were the days where as kids we had face to face conversations. If I wanted to have a long conversation over the phone with my girlfriend, I had to get a load of quarters and walk to the corner and get on the pay phone. We spoke till the recorded message said.....you have 3 minutes left...please deposit one quarter. The Breakfast Club, Red Dawn, Fast Times at Ridgemont High to name a few will always be all time classics.",1417824000,,1040,4.053398058252427

It might seem really simple and pointless but underlining the epic library dance, weed, sexual innuendos and all out teen drama, there is a powerful message about accepting others and yourself for who you are: there is no caste system; be you and the RIGHT people will gravitate and love and respect you.

57680,4,078322687X,"John Hughess film The Breakfast Club is one of the greatest teen inspired films of all time. Filmed in 1985, this teen drama features the most popular actors of that time. Sure, being born in the 90s doesnt give me much experience about high school in the 80s, but I can imagine it wasn't that awesome. These five teens, which come from far different cliques, are forced to spend their Saturday with each other in detention. They have absolutely nothing in common on the surface but quickly learn that they have more in common than they think.
 You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Correct? Thats the way we saw each other at seven oclock this morning. We were brainwashed states Brian, or the Brain. This line is one of the most memorable of the film. This quote gives us a glimpse of what the movie is going to be about.
The Breakfast Club has character development that really comes out through the whole movie.  Each of the characters starts off being reserved about their lives and who they really are.  As they spend more time arguing and being awkward, each character reveals their lives to each other and shares things that no body would ever know about them. The characters learn that the basket case isn't that crazy, the athlete isn't so confident, the criminal played by Judd Nelson isn't that intimidating, and the princess played by Molly Ringwald, learns that theres more to high school than being the fairest maiden in the land. All five teens come to an understanding about accepting others because you never know who they are on the inside. They were all alike in the sense that they weren't perfect, and thats all something we can relate to.
The score creates an emotional connection towards the end of the movie.  I believe that the last song really makes the movie. Dont You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds, is memorable and leaves the viewer feeling inspired.  When most people hear that song, the first thing that comes to mind is The Breakfast Club, and leaves them smiling, and thirsty to see the movie again.  The whole playlist gives you an extra special feeling while watching the film.  You feel angry when there is fighting, you feel tripped out when they're doing drugs, and you feel so ecstatic when the characters do as well. You ponder, connect to the characters, and it makes you want to spend all Saturday with Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald, locked in a library inspired by a prison.
Overall this movie leaves you wanting more. I could watch it once a week and never get sick of seeing five teens put aside their differences to reveal new friendships. As a teen girl, Im a sucker for cheesy movies with an ending that throws you through a loop. The character development is so crystal clear in this film.  From being reserved, to revealing dark secrets, its amazing what one-day in detention can do to a kid. The score creates a phenomenal emotional connection to the film. If you haven't seen it, go on to Netflix and watch it tonight. Its a classic must see and youll see that Each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.",1411603200,,3233,4.5524956970740105

57778,5,078322687X,"If someone were to ask me what my favorite movie was I would quickly answer, The Breakfast Club. Released in 1985 under the direction of John Hughes, The Breakfast Club is a memorable movie. The Rotten Tomatoes movie reviewing website has a quick description of the movie saying, The Breakfast Club is a warm, insightful, and very funny look into the inner lives of teenagers (Rotten Tomatoes). With a wonderful cast of characters, a phenomenal story line, and amazing script, The Breakfast Club is definitely a movie worth the watch.
 In the beginning of the movie, five teenagers, all strangers to each other, are seen showing up for a Saturday detention at their high school. The Breakfast Club focuses on these five teenagers, Claire, Brian, Allison, Andy, and John, also known as Bender. Each character is unique and it is quite obvious that much thought was put into the creation of these characters. We have Claire, the spoiled prom queen; Brian, the nerd, who belongs to the math club and the physics club; Allison, the quite, shy, basket-case; Andy, the wrestling jock; and Bender, the trouble maker who always finds himself in detention. In the beginning of the film, the stereotyping of their characters really stands out, therefore making it easy to put a finger on who is who.
These teens have nothing in common at the beginning of the film but their shared Saturday in detention. As the film progresses and the teenagers start to feel more comfortable around each other, we start to see a change. In the beginning, they are sitting in the library, counting down the hours until they can finally get away from the weird people surrounding them. Principal Vernon walks into the library, giving commands to sit still and not talk, and gives them an assignment; they must write a one thousand word essay on who they think they are. The library doors are to stay open, and with that said, Principal Vernon leaves to go to his office. Soon, Bender has taken the screws out of the door, so they are forced to shut. Once the doors become closed, the teenagers character traits are shown even more. They learn what makes each other angry, what makes each other sad, and even a few secrets about each other. It shows how as teenagers, they are so used to having things go their way and only putting themselves in situations comfortable for themselves. By the end of the film, we see that as they have gone through this day, being in an uncomfortable situation, they really let their walls down, and watching this all unfold before your eyes in ninety seven minutes really makes you realize that the story line is phenomenal.
I have seen The Breakfast Club a countless number of times, but I remember that even after the first time I watched it, there were quite a few memorable quotes that stuck out. From the deeper meanings to the witty, sarcastic comebacks, the script of The Breakfast Club was wonderfully written. John Hughes was not only the director of this movie, but also the writer. Hughes is well known for creating some of the best movies in the 80s decade, and The Breakfast Club is definitely one of them. After watching this film a countless number of times, I have done a pretty good job at memorizing about eighty percent of the movie and this is due to the excellent script by John Hughes. Hughes talent of script writing was incredible, having a great combination of amusing comments, witty jokes, and meaningful conversations. The most memorable quote of The Breakfast Club would have to be the closing line,

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club (Hughes).

The Breakfast Club is by far one of the best movies ever made. A great movie needs to have a great cast of characters, an amazing story line, and a memorable script, and The Breakfast Club fits all three of these qualifications. Either watching this movie for the first time or watching it for your eighty-seventh time, you will not get tired of this movie. The humorous and incredible lines delivered by wonderful actors are what make this movie special. Honestly, if you have not seen this movie, I suggest you find a way to watch it as soon as possible. You will be very far from disappointed!",1405382400,,4633,4.64068209500609

I enjoyed the honesty and depth of emotion that was portrayed, it was never dressed up to please the audience.

With regards to language and content, its very tame by today's standard, there is nothing in there that you would not see in American high school life. The only difference is that they characters were willing to talk about it, and that was the strong point of the film.

The cast is somewhat one-dimensional, girls issues were under portrayed, and many things were left out. The only problem was that the film went by a little too fast in some parts, but there were no stagnant moments.

Story and acting I would give 4 stars, content (or lack of) I would give 2 stars, so it evens out to a 3.",1404864000,,803,4.405405405405405

57811,5,078322687X,"It's rare that a film will exude such raw and powerful emotion that is just as rooted in truth as it is in it's fiction. When The Breakfast Club was released in 1985, teenagers of the era were stunned by the profound revelation of hearing and seeing problems that they actually experienced.

In one way or another anyone could relate to one or more of the 5 archetypes and be emotionally invested in what they had to say. It isn't particularly surprising that over 25 years later many of these core issues remain the same in the life of the American adolescent.

Each actor helped contribute their piece to this seminal film, but perhaps none better than Ally Sheedy's character, the basket case. The young actors connected with their characters enough to make them incredibly believable and thus they connected with their audience. The film's eulogy gives it it's fitting and iconic ending.",1402963200,,891,4.816993464052287

57824,2,078322687X,"I'm not going to give this film a one-star ""aweful"" review, but it's bad. The lines are really cheesy and the writers made the assistant principal a sucker, which took away from the realism and credibility of the movie. Start with the cheese. Pick any random moment and you're guaranteed to find some of the corniest and most predictable and unsophisticated dialogue that one can fathom. An example of this cheesiness is when there are three people in the room: Bender, Brian and Claire and Bender said a few lines about Claire, teasing yer, and she said something like, ""stop making fun of me."" What the hell are you, 7? In the real world, high school girls like Claire wouldn't pay douchebags like this any attention at all, let alone be that vulnerable with a background like hers to somebody like him.

Another cheesy line is when Bender and the assistant principal have a heated exchange when Bender tells him to ""eat my shorts"" (which I initially thought originated from ""The Simpsons"") and ""Dick"" (the assistant principal) gives him extra Saturdays of detention for being an ass. Dick then asks him, ""you through?!"" and this supposed ""rebel"" says something as corny in rebuttal as, ""not-even-close, bud."" Haha. Hello, Pizza Hut, can I have some extra Breakfast Club cheese with my pizza?

They even have them all whistling to ""Colonel Bogey March."" Why would they have this supposed ""cool"" guy who ridicules other characters like Brian for being a dork all of a sudden have him whistling this song for squares? And why would the other characters who've found the guy (Bender) obnoxious for being a (four letter word that rhymes with stick), all of a sudden join in, in whistling the song with him?

Another part of the film that took away from the movie was the writers' writing of the school assistant principal as an unrealistic and far-fetched character. They write him as a sucker where it's as if he purposely and intentionally finds ways to be at a distance from the students so that they could act in mischievous manners. This guy's roaming in the halls more so than even the students. He's checking his reflection in the glass, singing, dancing. No principal or teacher does this, especially when he's upset at having to come in on a Saturday to deal with these obnoxious kids.

Bender trolls this guy, and all this school assistant principal can do is stand there and take it and say ""one more, one more"" (meaning Bender stays one extra Saturday for trolling him). That was one of the film's lowest moments. Meanwhile, you have Andrew Clark (Estevez's character) who not only doesn't rebel against or provoke Dick, but even does what he tells him to do (like moving a shelf to keep the door open after Bender takes the screws out from the door), and when the assistant principal isn't satisfied with the results he turns up on Andrew in a way that he doesn't with the guy who's been provoking and insulting him the most (Bender). It becomes unfair and hard to invest emotionally in. The writers play the assistant principal like a sucker. You know Bender took the screws from the door based on his reputation and his behavior with you, so why the hell is he acting like he didn't know who it was? ""Why is that door closed?! Why?! Who closed that door?!"" YOU KNOW WHO DID IT! He even says later on, ""you're not fooling anybody Bender. The next screw that falls out is gonna be you."" Then why didn't you confront Bender and do something about it? It kills the credibility of the movie. It becomes difficult to take it seriously. To make me invest in Dick's character as an assistant principal, I'm supposed to believe that he has the power to make Bender's life hell by punishing him for his actions, but he doesn't have any of that.

People touched on this. It's obvious why this film received the amount of high praise that it did, it's because people watched this growing up and had fond memories of watching a movie that they thought was cool back in 1985 or on VHS, and a movie that they identified with being of that age group/demographic at the time. So they find it difficult to cope with the reality that this film is 1) overrated, 2) cheesy and 3) has a critical dumbed-down cast member (assistant principal). Thankfully, you guys had me here to show you the light.",1402185600,,4289,4.6381578947368425

57905,5,078322687X,"This film is one of the most influential films I have ever watched. It reaches out to you - and your touched by it. No matter what little sub-culture you were shifted into whilst going through the trials and tribulations of Secondary school you could relate to it.

It may have been clichd but what film isn't, we like certain elements we can relate to otherwise what would we take from films.

Judd Nelson gives a convincing performance of 'Bender' the criminal. He managed to sway from angry to emotional - making you feel for him when he is describing what things are like at 'his house'. He seemed to have a lot of great lines including the Manilow comment! The emotion in this film is immense considering it is a teenage film - and touches on 5 lost characters who seem to be searching for some type of approval or acceptance. (Just like our-selves) Ringwald shows just how versatile she is, and very different from Pretty in Pink. I heard that Ally Sheedy originally went for Ringwalds part and they swapped?

Emilio Estevez carrys his role off very well as a Jock - it gets a little cringe worthy when hes high at the end - and rushing around like a loony. But the end with Ally Sheedy certainly makes up for it.

The ending is good, however even ten years later after I first saw this film I always wanted to know what they did the next day!

This is such a great film, I can relate to it so much! I love it is truly the best, you can watch over and over and never get tired of it.",1395014400,,1489,4.26595744680851

57929,5,078322687X,"I missed seeing this movie when it first came out in 1985 and only recently became aware of it. I began watching it with some trepidation, thinking it might be little more than a typical movie featuring high-school kids engaging in high-school hijinks. I was mistaken. The movie, which involves five teens who don't even know each other and have absolutely nothing in common thrown together for an all-day Saturday detention, starts out slowly. But it soon picks up as we witness the feelings that each of these students have toward their families (particularly their parents) coming out and the complexity of feelings they have toward each other developing. Not till close to the end, however, do the barriers that each has erected toward the others (and toward those who are not like them in general) begin to fall down and do they truly appreciate the others for who they are and for the struggles they are enduring.

This is a movie worth watching, even if you're long past your high school years. Although I attended high school nearly a generation before this movie takes place, I saw a remarkable similarity between these five characters and my contemporaries.",1391817600,,1167,4.893939393939394

57942,4,078322687X,"They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7 a.m., they had nothing to say, but by 4 p.m. they had bared their souls to each other and become good friends. John Hughes, creator of the critically acclaimed SIXTEEN CANDLES, wrote, directed and produced this hilarious and often touching comedy starring Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy and it just so happens that Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy also co-starred together in ST. ELMOS FIRE later that same year.

To the outside world they were simply the Jock(Emilio Estevez), the Brain(Anthony Michael Hall), the Criminal(Judd Nelson), the Princess(Molly Ringwald) and the Kook(Ally Sheedy), but to each other, they would always be THE BREAKFAST CLUB.

58037,2,078322687X,"SPOILER ALERT

Either I was way too old to see this movie for the first time or I have never fully recovered from being a high school outcast. Notwithstanding its cinematic merits (working with a tiny budget, writer-director  John Hughes gets some nice performances out of his cast) it struck me as pure fairy tale. If I'd seen it when I was younger, maybe some combination of my desire to believe in it and my angst-ridden sympathy with the characters would have made me love it. But at my age, I didn't. I still love Hughes's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" because it does not strive to be more than the charming frothy fantasy it is. ""The Breakfast Club,"" despite a few jokes at the expense of the vice principal ""supervising"" the detention, takes itself way too seriously.

You have high-school types: a quirkily attractive delinquent stoner (Judd Nelson), a conventionally good-looking athlete (Emilio Estevez), an affluent pink prom princess (Molly Ringwald), a straight-A nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and a misfit (Ally Sheedy). They all do a Saturday of detention together. Initially they dislike each other, but having nothing to do to alleviate their boredom other than talk to each other, they come to realize that each of them is more than a type as they bare their souls about their problems with school, their parents, sexuality and their cliques (or lack of a clique in Sheedy's case). They get high. By mid-afternoon, Hall's character says he now considers them all friends. Ringwald's character disagrees, certain that even though they may have bonded during their day of detention, on Monday morning, they'll be back with their cliques and ignoring each other in the halls.

By the end of the movie, Ringwald's character makes over Sheedy's character and turns her from a black-clad, black-eyelinered pre-goth to another pink princess and Estevez's wrestler is in love with Sheedy. Virginal Ringwald is in love with delinquent stoner Nelson and plans to date him to get even with her parents. Hall gets over not getting an A in shop class.

I was some combination of Hall and Sheedy's characters. Occasionally in high school I would be thrown in to a situation where I was alone with a girl like Ringwald's character or a guy like Nelson or Estevez's characters and have what I thought was a profound conversation that meant we could be friends, only to find that Ringwald's character was right: Within a couple of days, they stopped seeing or hearing me when I tried to say hello in the halls.

I know I'm in the minority, and maybe I'm just bitter, but I thought ""The Breakfast Club"" was selling a lie and not selling it at all convincingly.",1382313600,3,2656,4.826373626373626

58053,3,078322687X,"Although John Hughes' classic teenage film lacks an exciting plot, its exceptional character development and its timeless message make it a worthwhile watch. The film focuses on five high school students, each from a different social group, stuck in an eight hour Saturday detention. There's Bender, the criminal, Claire, the princess, Andy, the jock, Brian, the brain, and Allison, the basket case. They are stuck in a library with only each other for company, so gradually, even though there is initial resistance, they all begin to talk.
 The film's best quality isn't that it has an original, exciting plot, because it doesn't. With one setting, a high school, there is a lack of interesting scenery, and the premise of a film based on high school students was popular during the eighties and became overdone. However, the witty and thought-provoking banter between the characters and the development of each one helps to make up for the uninteresting plot. Each character tells their story, offering tidbits about their family and personal lives and they slowly start to develop into much more than the stereotypical nicknames they're given. At the beginning of the film, as soon as Principal Vernon leaves the room after addressing the students, Bender (Judd Nelson), in true troublemaker fashion, begins trying to get a rise out of Andy (Emilio Estevez) and Claire (Molly Ringwald), and succeeds. Claire points this out to Andy, telling him, ""Just ignore him."" Bender replies with, ""Sweets? You couldn't ignore me if you tried"", to which she has no response. Following, there is a moment of intense eye contact between Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson. This scene sets the stage for the continuous sexual tension between Claire and Bender throughout the film. Bender has some of the most memorable lines of the film and delivers them well, dripping with sarcasm. Estevez does an excellent job of playing the tough jock, but occasionally throws in a sensitive moment. He doesn't hesitate to threaten Bender after he insults the girls, but when everyone else is shunning Allison (Ally Sheedy), he stops and listens to her. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is the typical brain, throwing irrelevant academic information into the conversation and quickly shutting his trap if he is challenged. However, Hughes reveals another side to Brian when they all open up to each other, a side most viewers wouldn't expect. Sheedy does an excellent job of playing the school basket case. Her delivery of biting dialogue and her accurate portrayal of quirky, strange habits are enough to make the viewer believe she is a little bit crazy.
At some point or another throughout the day, they all open up and reveal very personal secrets about their lives. It's no surprise to the viewer that each of them isn't exactly as they seem on the outside, and they don't all completely fit their character molds. Andy points this out to all of them saying, ""We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all."" Some of their secrets are predictable, yes, but the problems these kids face are realistic and relatable to current teens, even over twenty years after the film was made.
The Breakfast Club may lack originality and a sense of excitement, but there's no doubt the film has a timeless message. Everyone has their problems, even those that seem most put together. Hughes is able to keep the audience appeased while delivering this message, and the film has enough interesting moments to keep the audience entertained. Each viewer will have his or her own opinion on the story, but there is no doubt that The Breakfast Club has become an American classic.",1379894400,,3664,4.9869281045751634

This film shows us all the influence of cliques in high school and how they can strip us of our individuality.  Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy come into Saturday as five very different people and while their characteristics don't change, their outlook does.  By the end of this film, you'll be wishing that they'd all be sitting together at the same lunch table the following Monday, but you know that, thanks to social conventions that dictate their lives, that will never happen.  I wonder what a sequel would have been like (one was considered but never followed through on.)

58099,5,078322687X,I can't say much more than has already been said about this movie.  It's a movie that defined a generation and it's overall just FUN!,1374883200,,133,4.32
58100,5,078322687X,"I remember first seeing this movie when I was like six years old. My Daddy used to watch it every time her found on TV. I must say I use to hate this movie so much. Why? I guess it was because I didn't understand it when I was younger. But since I have gotten older, I see it in a different light. I can relate to it more now, especially when I became a high school freshman, it shows me that there are many walks of life. And who says we can't I be friends?

The Breakfast Club has a very simple plot: five high school-aged kids are sentenced to a Saturday in detention. Each character personifies a clichd, but somewhat misunderstood stereotype. We have the jock/athlete, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez); the nerd/brain, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall); the popular girl/princess, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald); the bad boy/criminal, John Bender (Judd Nelson); and the outsider/basket case, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). The adult characters include Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), the strict school assistant principal; Carl Reed (John Kapelos), the goofy school janitor; Brian's strict mother; Andrew's controlling father; and Claire's dimwitted/rich father.

So why would this little teen comedy-drama be so long-lasting? I guess just because it shows us that all children, from all walks of life, have challenging home lives and are under a lot of pressure. It does also show us that everybody can get along with another, if (and I stress IF) we put our minds to it. I mean why do we think we shouldn't get along? Just because someone is different in their looks, personality, sexual preference, why shouldn't we respect them and at least try to compromise our differences? Society is the answer. The public that has surrounded us has in a way ""brainwashed"" us into believing that we shouldn't get along. This movie shows us we can.

Besides from the lessons this movie does offer, The Breakfast Club has sort of became a cultural phenomenon. It has been parodied (most recently on Nickelodeon's Victorious) and has consistently dominated popularity polls for best teen films of all time, and as one of the best films of the 1980s in general. It finds new audiences in a new generation everyday. I mean come on, if this doesn't tell people this movie has ""something"", I don't know what will.

The movie has often been noted as the quintessential ""Brat Pack"" movie. The most famous Brat Pack members, Ringwald, Hall, Nelson, Sheedy, and Estevez, are all represented in this movie. Other members of the infamous ""club"" include: Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, and Andrew McCarthy, although they made far less appearances in so-called ""Brat Pack movies"".

In general, The Breakfast Club has a lot to offer. Comedy. Drama. Lessons. And just about everything else. It is a perfect film I think a lot of young people should see. The edited versions (which cut out the inferior language and sexual references) could be shown in High Schools and still have the same affect. The Breakfast Club will not disappoint you. It should not anyways. I must say, though, if you have negative or snobbish feelings about the movie already, odds are you won't see what the fuss is all about. It's a movie. A great movie. A movie that should never be forgotten. Long live The Breakfast Club.",1374710400,,3272,4.846153846153846

58322,5,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club is a 1985 teen ""comedy"" written by none other than John Hughes, the king of 80s teen movies. TBC is what I personally consider to be one one of his top three best movies. It's amazing to me the same man responsible for a movie like this went on to do movies like Baby's Day Out. But I digress.

The Breakfast Club brings together some of the most famous of the Brat Pack, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Michael Anthony Hall, Emilio Estevez, and Ally Sheedy as a group of high school students (interestingly enough, only two were actually high school aged at the time) sent to Saturday morning detention. All come from very different walks of lives and had little to do with one another but now are forced to endure each other.

When you really look at it, it's strange how such a simple plot for a movie can turn into such a well-loved and memorable movie, isn't it? I think it's because the characters are so great as well as the acting itself. I couldn't see anyone but Judd Nelson as Bender (though another random fact is originally the role was intended for Emilio Estevez).

It really is a well-acted movie by all the principal actors. Each character represents a ""clique"" you probably knew in high school and there's likely a character that, to some degree, you'll be able to relate to the most which is another thing I think adds to the movie.

As for the blu-ray quality, it was okay. I don't remember the quality on the VHS well enough to compare, but I have no complaints about the blu-ray.

If you've never seen it, I think The Breakfast Club is very worth a viewing.",1356825600,,1595,4.448630136986301

Decent picture and sound, too (certainly better than previous releases).  My only, minor complaint are the extras.  Hence, the four, instead of five star rating.

I thoroughly love the online reviewing world and trust their judgement on many many many things that I choose to purchase or not... given this I became utterly infuriated at the poor reviews representing this particular copy of BFC as they represented everything that is WRONG with the online reviewing community...

So here I go... for better or worse (and in this case... better and better)

The breakdown...

FIRST OFF! I'll note i purchased this at wal-mart because its actually cheaper!!??!?!?!? than amazon... i picked it up for $11.99 which is a legit steal for everything provided...

Packaging: Nothing special... standard blu-ray affair with a cardboard cover overlay... I will note that the permanent plastic under the overlay that protects the cover-insert is horridly warped with a ripple effect... may bother hardcore people but... there really should be a higher end version of this movie for those people anyway...

Contents: Good stuff here... this is in fact TWO discs... not like some of the old-school HD DVD/DVD Combos... there is a full fledged DVD movie and a full fledged Blu-ray Disc... PERFECT!!!! it may just be an annoyance to me but I hate double sided discs for many many reasons...

DA BLU-RAY (AKA Why you're here!!!) :

Quality to me is impeccable... I think some people forget how old these classics are... we're talking about resurrecting film that is ages old and expecting it to be Avatar (or whatever) quality... I am actually STUNNED by how good this blu-ray transfer looks... it really is GOOD... I'm watching it right now on a 55"" DLP 1080p with my PS3 and 7.1 - and no I'm not bragging or anything, just stating for peoples own reference - and in my opinion its pretty excellent... ZERO complaints here... the video looks great... the audio is in line and on par... this isn't Sound of Music or Fiddler... so audio-wise it can be hard to say one way or another as long as the lines sync up with the lips... and they do...

DVD : who cares... it'll be dvd quality, which is GREAT, don't get me wrong... it's just icing on the cake imo

Digital Content : not rated... sorry I just don't use digital movies that much... yet... but I will definitely utilize it once it's a bit more viable and necessary...

The Movie : Uhm... go away

CONCLUSION : WORTH THE MONEY... still completely stunned that wal-mart beat out amazon on the price... a bit angered I paid taxes on it... but 11.99 + tax is cheaper than the current amazon price...

Anyway... ENJOY!",1332201600,7,2620,4.706783369803063

It's amazing how even after all these years it still reaches a new generation of people and still has the same impact it always has.

58384,5,078322687X,"It was a real pleasure watching this movie once again, twenty-five years after I originally saw it, while I myself was still in high school.
Say what you will about the late John Hughes, this particular movie somehow captured what it is to be a young person in a way that few others ever did or ever will.
This movie is centered around seven people:
The late Paul Gleason, as school principal and antagonist, Richard Vernon.
John Kapelos, as the surprisingly funny and canny janitor, Carl.
Anthony Michael Hall, as Brian Johnson, the smart, somewhat nerdy kid.
Emilio Estevez, as Andrew Clark, the wrestling jock.
Ally Sheedy, as Allison Reynolds, the proto-emo outcast girl.
Molly Ringwald, as Claire Standish, the designer clothes wearing princess.
Judd Nelson, as John Bender, the defiant kid, the one we would have called a hood back in the day.
Bender is a veteran of the detention routine, very well acquainted with Vernon.

The last five characters are the students forced to come in for Saturday detention, during which Principal Vernon has given them the assignment of writing a 1,000 word essay about exactly what each of them thinks he/she really is.
That alone sets the tone for how bellicose Vernon is going to be, even before he starts interacting with them.
Bender immediately expresses his disdain for him within the first five minutes of Vernon setting the terms, with one of the funniest lines I recall in a movie: ""Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?"" winning himself yet another Saturday on the spot.
From there, Bender systematically sets about tormenting first Vernon, then each of the kids, focusing particularly on Claire, someone who couldn't be more his polar opposite in attitude and economic status.
At first, it's tough to like Bender, given his boorish treatment of first Claire, then to Brian and Andrew, but there is something charismatic about him that starts to show through, and he turns out to be surprisingly intelligent.
He propels the story, especially for the first two thirds, clashing with principal and kid alike, but bringing out in each something that wouldn't have emerged otherwise.
Claire is troubled by how her parents seem to use her against each other, and -- as is common with the popular kids -- held prisoner to her friends' dictates.
Allison is ignored by her parents and basically friendless at the beginning of the movie.
Andrew is a jock driven relentlessly by a dad obsessed with winning to the exclusion of all else.
Brian is quite a bit like Andrew, except both parents are obsessed with his academic achievement.
Then we have Bender, who proves he's not just telling stories when he memorably reenacts how he has been badly physically abused at home.

Watching this all over again, I realize that I knew all of the characters to one extent or another in high school, and most people could identify with each to one degree or another.
The dialogue is biting, often witty, and nearly always sarcastic.
The conflict that only grows with time between Bender and Vernon propels the movie, and Bender's harsh words for each of the kids eventually get them to open up in ways they never would have done without him to berate them.
Because of this juxtaposition of the sarcastic with the sadness each of them has, this manages to be a very touching movie that does so without being cloying about it.
I won't spoil the movie for those of you who have yet to see it, but I will just say that this is no action movie or cookie cutter teen movie.
This is about the universal misgivings that people have throughout their lives, especially when they are young and at their most vulnerable.

There is little doubt that Judd Nelson's Bender is the driving force here, and he is very good in that role, wildly veering from wickedly funny to exploding into rage, with only his unusually strong command of the English language making him just a bit unbelievable.
Ally Sheedy's Allison has the least dialogue by far, but she plays it very well, getting the maximum out of her character with her expressions and the laborious way that she speaks, as Nelson and Hall observe during the commentary track, as if she were unpracticed at speaking.
Hall plays Brian very well, just the type of personality of the nerdy guy, but with a nerd's sensitivity and intelligence.
Estevez's Andrew is in some ways even better, first playing tough guy tempered with chivalry by standing up to Bender's taunting of Claire, then showing that he really is much more than just an athlete, especially when recounting the real reason that he got put on detention with the others and when talking one-on-one with Allison.
Ringwald's Claire is also very good, and she is a nice foil for Bender, who quickly pivots from tweaking Vernon to making openly crude comments toward her.
At first, it's tough to feel too sorry for her, given her membership in the popular clique, but she emerges as someone who would prefer to be her own person, and it turns out that Bender, is the one person who brings that out more than anyone else.
Kapelo as Carl didn't have much time on screen, but he was a real highlight, showing that he is much more than a blue collar guy, but someone with a real understanding of human nature and wisdom.
Gleason as Vernon was in some ways the best of all, not just a cardboard cutout authoritarian, but someone even with just a hint of self doubt. He is particularly funny, with his impenetrable front that first Bender, then the other kids, and finally even he (unintentionally) puncture throughout the movie.

Anyone wondering about the R rating for this should know that there is no nudity or anything of the sort, but that the reason for the rating was because of some harsh language, with some sexual comments thrown in.
This is a nicely packaged Blu-Ray, with both the regular movie and the audio commentary version with Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, and DVD producer Jason Hillhouse.
You also get a 12-part documentary titled ""Sincerely Yours,"" with focus placed on each of the actors, plus various other aspects of the movie itself.
They also include the five minute ""The Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack,"" a short discussion of exactly what it says, and speaking for myself, I always thought that term was unfairly dismissive, condescending, and smacked of a certain elitism of elders toward young upstarts.
This is a BD-Live disk, so there are some features available through it directly online, but I didn't really bother exploring those.

Picture quality was good and certainly an improvement over conventional DVD upscaled on a 1080p set, but I was surprised at how it was slightly grainy in parts when I got up close to my 1080p TV, almost as if the producers had simply produced the Blu-Ray from the exact same resolution master from the DVD release instead of going back to the original film itself to make a Blu-Ray specific master.
However, the minor graininess in no way detracted from the movie, which is -- after all -- about the characters.
I realize that John Hughes was often derided by the elites in show business when he was still alive, and to some extent even now, but this to me is one of his two very best movies, the other being the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planes-Trains-and-Automobiles-Those-Aren-t-Pillows-Edition/dp/B002JIOOAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)</a>.

58392,5,078322687X,"The movie ""The Breakfast Club"", directed by John Hughes, is arguably one of the best movies of all time. It is a unique film that takes the different ""typical"" personalities of teenagers in high school and brings them together for Saturday detention. The different characters include Andrew Clark, the jock; Claire Standish, the most popular girl in school; Brian Johnson, the geek; John Bender, the rebel; and Allison Reynolds, the outcast. With all of them being completely different, they don't agree on much or have much in common. But when you leave a group of people in a room alone from seven in the morning until four in the afternoon, they will eventually talk and discover new things about themselves. The beginning of the movie is mainly the group arguing, until they come to a point where they find things in common. They realize they don't get along with their parents, and they undergo much pressure from their friends.
Although I am a big fan of this movie, some things bothered me. In the end of the movie, the jock ends up with the outcast and the rebel ends up with the popular girl, but where does that leave Brian? There are three guys and two girls so one of them will end up alone, but I think it would have been better if Brian ended up with someone because he is the ""geek"" and it is stereotypical that he wouldn't end up with a girl. Another thing that upset me was when they agreed that Monday morning wouldn't be any different than usual. They spend nine hours together bonding, but will pretend they don't know each other at school? It contradicts the point of the movie in my opinion.
I think the best part is when Vernon, the cruel teacher in charge of detention, makes them write an essay describing who they are. After the entire group has been through, they decided to write one essay for them all. The essay is about how they are not who society thinks them to be, which is a great moral in the movie. Again, I think ""The Breakfast Club"" is a fantastic movie and people will really enjoy it.",1319068800,,2025,4.505434782608695

58398,5,078322687X,"John Hughes's ""The Breakfast Club"" may be the defining teen movie of the 80s. The way Hughes culminates representatives of different high school cliques -- including the way they dress, the way they talk, the way they eat, and the surprising way they all eventually connect -- and makes something meaningful and entertaining out of it provides one of the best-written film scripts, along with an impeccable cast and soundtrack. Note: The R-rating comes from occassional language and sex-related comments, which shouldn't be taken lightly. The film also emphasizes (as seen in other Hughes films) teen angst, yet paints an honest portrait of what it must have been like to be a teenager in the 80s.

The DVD came out great, with crisp picture quality and sound.",1309824000,,760,4.984251968503937
58399,5,078322687X,"Watching ""The Breakfast Club"" brings back a certain nostalgia from the 1980's that felt fun, warm, and engaging. Seeing the ""Brat Pack"" together brings back so many fond memories. This is John Hughes' best movie and deserves the blu-ray treatment.

With that said, the PQ is better than the DVD, but needs improvement which is very unlikely at this point considering this is the 25th anniversary edition. Yes, a good part of the grain is cleaned up and there is a noticeable improvement, however I think it falls short of what Universal could have done with this. That being said, it is worth the upgrade as long as you are paying less than $20.00 for this.

The AQ is a more drastic improvement. This movie is very dialogue heavy so you aren't going to be ""blown away"" by the audio, but it is quite pleasing in HD surround sound. Where the audio shines is during the introduction, and towards the end when the music is playing. This audio remaster exceeds expectations compared to the PQ.

The extras including director commentary and interviews with the cast members years later. Those actually were pretty intriguing to watch.

Despite the fact that Universal could have spent more time and a little more money with the video quality, it is a decent upgrade and should be on the list to buy for any serious collector who enjoyed this movie.",1309651200,7,1343,4.702127659574468

58408,5,078322687X,"In ""The Breakfast Club,"" five teens show up for detention on a Saturday at a fictional Chicago-area high school.  Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, and Judd Nelson are cast as the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal.

At the beginning of the film, some of the teens show hostility to one another as they see each other in their stereotypical roles.  But as the movie progresses, they begin to open up to each other about the problems in their lives and eventually see each other differently, as they find that they all have more in common than they think--they all have problems at school or at home to some degree, and they become friends once they have walked a mile in each other's shoes.

Those who have reached middle age and watch the film for the first time since youth will notice that they more readily identify with the principal and some (but not all) of the situations that he faces as well.

""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds is the theme song of the movie--it is fitting that one of the best movies of the Eighties has one of the best pop songs of the decade as its theme.

""The Breakfast Club"" often turns up on lists of favorite movies compiled by Generation Xers.  My guess is that those in Generation Y, the Millennial Generation, and future generations will relate to the film just as my generation did back in 1985, as the themes in the movie are timeless.",1291075200,,1451,4.53639846743295

58411,2,078322687X,"This is just one of the most overrated films of all time.  Probably because of the emotional investment so many of its fans have in it, as they saw it when they were teenagers, or, just as likely, pre-teenagers.  But even older critics seemed to have suspended their judgment.

Despite having been made in, and so heavily identified with, the 80's, Breakfast Club is firmly rooted in the pop psychology movement of the late 60's/early 70's.  Much of the ""action"" In the film consists of the eponymous ""club""  sitting in a circle and trying to ""break down"" each other's ""walls"" (in the parlance of the times), a trope directly lifted from the 70's pop psychology Encounter Group therapy session of the type seen in films like ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"".  A lot of these scenes are right out of the rule book of the infamous Synanon House of the period, where the ""encounter"" style was far more aggressive, and could turn into an attack on a single person.  This happens a lot in Breakfast Club, to each of the characters.  Most of this psychological terror is carried out by the school bully, Bender, played by then-25-year-old Judd Nelson, who incessantly harasses most of the other kids in room, who are there involuntarily, (for detention).  The only ""kid"" (actually a 25-year old Emilio Estevez playing a kid) to hold his own against him is Andy, ""the jock"".  There's also ""the nerd"", played to the hilt by Anthony Michael Hall, and ""the prom queen"", played by Molly Ringwald, ( about two years away from throwing her career right down the dustbin of history ).  Ally Sheedy plays ""the loner"".

In the weird logic of Hollywood, all of this abuse just makes the kids love Bender more.  Similarly, at other points in Breakfast Club we are repeatedly expected to feel sympathy not for the victims of abuse, but for their tormentors, not only in Bender's bullying actions, but in the Estevez character's whining, self-pitying (and, I might add, seemingly endless) monologue about committing some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid.  Apparently, it really hurts to bully people.  The film industry, largely made up of people with Leftist tendencies, often asks us to sympathize with bullies and criminal perps, a couple of the most egregious examples being the bleeding-heart hand wringer Dead Man Walking and the South African film Tsotsi.

The ""encounter sessions"" in Breakfast Club are interspersed with small, generally non-sequitir vignettes of 50's-style teen rebellion, e.g., the crazy, spontaneous dance scene, backed by a soundtrack that was already dated back in 1985.  This little sequence gives the movie its biggest WTF moment, when Estevez lets out a leonine roar, and suddenly a plate glass window shatters ( It plays like some weird fusion of Heroes, Dune,  and Footloose ).  So disjointed is this film that it seems as if several different writers were working on different parts of the movie, and when they were done writing, they just sort of patched it all together in random order.

Worst of all is the way the film resolves itself, as, for no apparent reason, four out of the five kids pair up (guess who gets left out?  Bingo!  ""The Nerd""!  How's that for a depressing message for at least a portion of the audience in a film that fancies itself ""uplifting""?)  In addition, the eccentric ""loner"" chick is turned into a clone of the prom queen (and there's another nice message, this time for the female portion of the audience: conform, girlie)!",1285459200,13,3480,4.829679595278246

58414,5,078322687X,"This movie was highly recommended by two teenagers, respectively 18 and 20 years old, so we decided to watch it together.

The movie is about a diverse group of high school students who have committed infractions and are brought together to serve an 8 hour - Saturday detention.

Featured are: Emilio Estevez who plays the role of the athlete, Jud Nelson who plays a troubled young man, Ally Sheedy as a rather strange young woman, beautiful and popular girl played by Molly Ringwald and a rather intelligent ""nerd"" played by Anthony Michael Hall.

As the day unfolds, these young people start communicating, breaking the social barriers that set them apart and we see how the personalities surface as they share the issues of each particular family.

The movie is excellent. It made us consider how dissimilar people brought together can identify similarities and become, if not friends, accepting of each other. Would highly recommend watching with teenagers as the movie works these personalities through the age where transformation into adulthood is taking place.

58415,4,078322687X,"I saw this today and was very impressed with the picture quality. Considering the film stock and lenses used, it looks fantastic. This is definitely the best that the film has ever looked, other than at the theater. Colors are natural, blacks deep, detail as much as there can be with the elements used, and there are very few print artifacts; those that are there pass so quickly that they don't intrude on the proceedings. There is a fine sheen of film grain that is supposed to be there, without a hint of digital manipulation. If this is an old HD master that was used for the HD-DVD, I would say that it still looks really good. It couldn't get much better than it this, image-wise.
My only complaint would be the sound. I believe that The Breakfast Club was in mono when it came out, so everything spills from the center channel with a bit of spread to the other channels. Dialogue sounds muffled and dated, which makes me wonder if Universal couldn't have gone back to the original masters and remixed the audio for a more articulated and defined sound. A lot can be done with the computer technology today and I wish it would've been utilized here. Other than that, I am very happy to see this classic from my youth in such great shape. I definitely recommend this to fans of the film. It is a worthy upgrade from the DVD releases.",1281139200,2,1339,4.4471544715447155
58416,4,078322687X,"I admit it's been such a long time since I've seen the Breakfast Club that it felt a lot like the first time when I watched this on the recent Blu Ray release, so I really can't compare it to the DVD release or any others.  I can say, however, that I was very pleased with the picture quality.

Fans know this movie has a very basic storyline, and very few scene changes.  But nonetheless, you still get a juicy taste of 1080p while watching it.  Facial closeups look crystal clear and gorgeous, while the background has fantastic depth.  This is particularly vivid during the ending speeches.  The depth is so perfect you have that great 3D feel that makes Blu Ray fans giddy.

As far as grain and flickers are concerned, I didn't see any.  I may not be as picky as some HD scholars, but I was actively trying to look for any signs of a bad transfer nothing caught my immediate attention.

My only complaint about this release, as is my complaint with just about every Universal release, is that the loading time is a little ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's their main menu template or what, but all my Universal blus take ages to load.

Overall, if you've never seen this movie you really ought to watch it.  Many try to make intelligent high school movies, but very few succeed.  The Breakfast Club is one of the lucky few.  It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's well acted, directed, and written.  Its stood the test of time (25 years!) but thanks to blu ray, you can now watch it and feel like you're viewing a new release because of the perfect clarity.  Even if you have seen it a 1000 times, however, I'm willing to bet its worth the DVD upgrade.

I already own the other two films on DVD and so I decided to buy THE BREAKFAST CLUB (FLASHBACK EDITION) DVD, not only because of the recent untimely death of director/writer John Hughes, but also to add to my library.

Watching it again last night and it all comes back to why this is one of my favorite movies, not just of the 80s, but of all time.

The story is a simple one: five young adults who happen to represent the archetypal teenager--the jock, the nerd, the goth recluse, the delinquent rebel, and the rich and popular prom queen--all spend a Saturday morning in detention together. As the course of the day goes on they fight, get stoned, and open up to each other with brutal honesty that reveals, under the surface, that they have more in common then they'd like to think. In the end, they learn something about themselves and each other that they didn't have that morning.

It's such a great story about how everyone has problems and that things are not always what they seem, especially for young adults.

Hughes's story is captivating and comical and the ensemble cast is brilliant!

The DVD transfer looks great and there's some goodies in the special features:

THE BREAKFAST CLUB is still a great film to watch and reminds us of what it was like back then when we weren't taken seriously because we were teenagers. It also reminds us, now that we have become the adults, not to take life too seriously either.",1253232000,5,3459,5.850894632206759

If they remaster it, and pick up what was either left on the cutting room floor, or left out of the final production, it could make a substantial turn in how we view the movie.  Watch the ORIGINAL trailer on the DVD.  It shows you something left out of the final production.  Something that implied there was an additional segment or subplot to be in the movie that they left on the floor in editing.

Overall it is an era movie.  Something a lot of us remember dealing with growing up, peer pressure and ""conformity"" in youth.  Trying to find ones place in the crowd.  A movie like, many others, will most likely be remade with newer songs so it isn't as dated when aired years down the road.",1249689600,,746,4.316546762589928

the popular girl with the Jock to start that changes to the
jock and Kook and the princess and the criminal.

The picture is clearer than the original and the sound quality seems to be much better in the film itself.

There are never enough words to describe how fantastic this movie is.  It speaks to multiple generations of young people without condescention.

Honestly, I would recommend it to anyone starting high school or better yet, anyone who has already gotten to know a year or two of it.

Please do not be put off by its R-rating.  The issues and kind of language that gave it this rating can be heard in the span of one day in high school.  It's tastefully done and packed with emotion.
I cannot praise this film enough.

Classic movie!",1236211200,,1027,4.5683060109289615
58484,3,078322687X,"There's a reason that The Breakfast Club remains a pre-teen and teen favorite. Everything bad that happened to these kids is the fault of the adults around them. The only redeemable adult in the film is the janitor.

The cast was good, but not great. Judd Nelson was 25 at the time of this film, looks like it, and he isn't believable as even a high school senior who had been held back a couple of years. Molly Ringwald was great and Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy did fine as well. Anthony Michael Hall was very young in this movie, seemed to be in a bit over his head at times, and overacted to compensate for it.

The basic premise of kids from a variety of social groups forming some sort of friendship when forced together explains the popularity of the film, but simply isn't realistic. Anyone who has been in a real life situation like this in high school can attest to the fact that the barriers separating the social cliques do no simply break down over eight hours.

The point to the film, which explains its popularity with the young, is that nothing is your fault. They certainly felt bad for what they did to end up in detention, but through their analysis they all determined it was their parent's fault. Parents are shown only briefly at the beginning, end, and are one dimensional caricatures. Ironically enough while the kids blame their parents for their actions, they also come to the realization that inevitably they will become their parents. So while the problem (social cliques) appears to be temporarily solved, it certainly isn't. Another message of the film is that kids from every social strata and background would be good, decent, people if it weren't for all of the adults. Speaking of adults, the principle is shown as only a kid could see one; not really human, but a egotistical bully and dunce who is constantly outwitted by high school kids.

There were some good moments in the film like when the Princess takes interest in the criminal; a very believable form of rebellion for her. Also when the Criminal is shown to be a loud mouthed coward who when threatened with genuine violence backs down.

I enjoyed this film when I was a teenager and I have a suspicion that most of the positive reviews are nostalgic ones rather than modern takes on the movie. Adults who think this is an accurate portrayal of the world are firmly stuck in high school.",1236124800,8,2384,4.6

The one I recall the most is when they are running through the hall and Ally Sheedy walks by the door of the teachers lounge really slow and Molly Ringwald says,""She is wierd... but she is cool."" Great clip and not in the movie version.

The film's bad boy Judd Nelson, is entertaining and provides the necessary sparkplug to get things going, innevitably with a love affair, with guess who. No, not with Emillio Estavez, the jock who I guess was the character representing the establishment. All in all, maybe better than a 3 star film, had only The Smiths tunes been used.

Now could they get any crew to talk about the movie maybe john Hughes? There only one lame attempt to explain the process of the production is the costume designer. Now I am sure she is great at her job but there is only so much you can here about the look of the characters.
So to make up for such large holes such as no molly, no Emilio, no john Hughes and one crew member they bring out the big guns people who have directed other teen movies. Diablo I plagiarized a South Korean movie Cody who wrote the film Juno. She just fumbles about with phrases like ""I heard they did this.""

Brilliant performances by all, with so many quotes I could fill a notebook. Who doesn't love telling an authority figure to 'EAT MY SHORTS'!

As the other reviewer says, this doesn't SEEM to have the ""deleted scenes"" released on TV (usually used to replace racier or more violent scenes on a TV broadcast, see the 4 disc edition of Superman (1977) as an example of re-cutting these scenes into a movie).

58506,5,078322687X,"A new release of The Breakfast Club is coming out in September with an audio commentary by Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall, a couple features called ""Sincerely Yours"" and ""Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack,"" and the theatrical trailer.  These will be the first real special features to have been included with The Breakfast Club on DVD.  It's known that there are deleted scenes (some have been shown on TV), but there was no mention of any in the announcement for the new DVD.

The Breakfast Club is considered by many the quintessential high school movie, which is quite a comment on high school, as almost the entire film takes place in detention.  Five students, each representing a type but fleshed out into real characters as the film develops, are stuck together on a Saturday in detention.  In terms they use themselves, there's a ""criminal"" (Judd Nelson), a ""princess"" (Molly Ringwald), a ""jock"" (Emilio Estevez), a ""brain"" (Anthony Michael Hall), and a ""basket case"" (Ally Sheedy).  Effectively portrayed tension between the five builds to explosive levels before they finally discover how much they have in common.  There is a lot of sharp humor, some hijinks, a lot of emotional release in the last third.  The acting is very good.  Nelson is especially good as the main catalyst for the tension, projecting a powerful personality and sharp mind turned in against self and back out at others.

I loved this movie in the '80s.  I still like it and admire it now, though its formula seems a little more prominent to me than it used to.  By today's standards it may seem to pull its punches when it comes to the reasons kids have to be unhappy and in trouble, but it strikes a fair balance between entertaining teen comedy and realism.  It's also a fine time capsule from the '80s.

The new DVD will be 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DTS 5.1.  No indication has been given that this will be any different from the older DVDs.

New Flashback Editions of two other John Hughes classics, Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, are slated to come out on the same day as this one.  Each will include a feature about the film.  Weird Science will also have the Weird Science TV series pilot episode and the theatrical trailer.  Apparently only this one gets an audio commentary.  No Blu-ray announcements yet.

He's like an icon to many Gen Xers, not necessarily because they all like his films (many don't), but because he was the quinessential 80's teenage comedy man.  But this film is probably the most overrated one he ever did.  I thought it was good when I first saw it, but it's really tame stuff masquerading as edgy, pointed teen angst.  The concept itself could have been interesting (a day's detention with 5 typical high school types, the nerd, the spoiled queen, the druggie, the jock, and the ""alternate"" chick), and it's surprising that Hollywood greenlighted a film with no real plot like this one (Hughes had major pull in those days).  But the execution is really pedestrian.  I especially dislike the ending, in which the alternate chick cleans up and ends up with the jock (never happen), and the druggie and the queen together was even more preposterous.  It's ridiculous.  It completely undermines the entire story of the 5 castes of teenagers.  There are a few choice moments (the man who played the principal was quite funny at times), and some of the dialogue is decent, but overall it will mainly be remembered for a nostlagia trip for 80's kids.",1202601600,6,1217,4.676056338028169

The characters, who hadn't met before, have complete mistrust of each other at the start.  As the movie progresses, each character gradually opens up to prying questions from the others; first, it seems, simply to fight off boredom.  At first, their defense mechanisms are on full guard, and some lie about who they are and why they are in detention.  But as the diverse personalities begin to sympathize with each other, they become more honest.  Eventually, they each admit the true reason for their detention, and reveal their most painful emotions.

58513,2,078322687X,"Don't let this one fool you.

While this angst-filled detention-as-confessional `80's Brat Pack flick is hailed as a banner of youthful freedom, the final resolution can't be viewed as anything but a Big Brother-ish commercial for the joys of conforming to what's socially acceptable. Think about it. Remember when the it-girl transformed the individualistic outsider into the image of what was in, and suddenly the loner became happy and accepted and wanted by the cool guy? A terrible message for anyone, but especially for kids forming a sense of self awareness.

The Breakfast Club isn't a very good movie but obviously it somehow strikes a chord with enough people for it to have classic status and be fondly recalled on best-of lists and has been paid tribute to on everything from songs to an episode of Dawson's Creek.

Molly Ringwald is pretty and talented, but not pretty or talented enough to make an impression as a spoiled teen queen. Nor are Nelson and Estevez buyable as class stoner and class jock. Kids this age are often shallow, but the roles here have all the real depth of a leaky baby pool.
Worse than the poor casting is Hughes' ""reach-to-be-deep"" script. This group of kids are supposed to jointly reach profound conclusions about their lives and themsleves in the matter of a few hours of detention. It's a try-too-hard grasp at brilliance that cheapens the viewer and writer both.

I graduated from High School that year and found life was more confusing than when I began it 4 years earlier.  I was very moved, by the Writing of The Movie Writers and the actors seemed very comfortable in dealing with eachother in this movie.  I thought the last 15 or 20 minutes seemed a little bit of an overkill to it because of the shift of the dialogue to various places in the School.  That approach hurt the early goings of The Movie, I think, but what do I know?  I think it very closely tried to resemble ""Rebel Without A Cause"", though without a lot of dramatics since it was soley teleplayed in the school.  It was in the dialogue that I found a Natalie Wood and a James Dean, though slighlty more hardened than Judd Nelson's bit..  hehehe...  The movie was great.

58548,5,078322687X,"""The Breakfast Club"" is the story of five high school students(Emilio Eztevez's character of Andrew Clark,Molly Ringwald's character of Claire Standish,Anthony Michael Hall's character of Brian Johnson,Judd Nelson's character of John Bender,and Ally Sheedy's character of Allison Reynolds)stuck in detention for one entire day. Dissapointing and quiet,right?

Dissapointing--yes--quiet--wrong!!!!! The principal in charge of all five students,Richard Vernon(the late Paul Gleason--RIP)is nothing more than arrogant and stubborn. He won't let anything get in the way of the detention he is giving being harder than a bowling ball on one's foot. Add that together with all of the mischief that John Bender carries with him to the detention,and You've got more than just a long day.

""The Breakfast Club"" may be a teen comedy/drama;yet,it is some of the best artistic work ever developed and pulled off. No doubt--without a question--""The Breakfast Club"" has some of the most antic humor ever pulled off on camera. You'll laugh hard at a line of comedy you know was written in the script--You'll laugh harder at its execution by whichever actor delivers it.

What is it that really makes ""The Breakfast Club"" shine? On top of how well-written the comedy is,the drama is just as impeccable. Sure--its a trait that even ""Happy Gilmore"" didn't forget to touch up on. Yet,the remarkable part is how the drama maintains feels of darkness and seriousness all in one,not going overboard but making its intention,power,and prescence known. Don't expect anything Oscar worthy. Understand the concept for what it is,and from ""The Breakfast Club"",You'll find keen traits that are not only very hard to find--could have come close to not existing.

As you may have noticed,what you have here is a ""special edition"" of ""The Breakfast Club""--a part of the High School Reunion Collection. The remastering is quite solid and adds to the enjoyment of the movie. It brings the 80's fashion and traits of ""The Breakfast Club"" to life so much to the point where the word nostalgia isn't crawling through your head. There are no real bonus feautures(unless you count the recommendations for a few other John Hughes films and the theatrical trailer for ""The Breakfast Club""),though. The remastering is good enough to forget bonus feautures. However,if you are intent on bonus feautures coming along with ""The Breakfast Club"",you have come to the wrong place.

Though this movie is usually considered a ""chick flick"" I have no problem watching it. Otherwise, besides certian immoral content in the film, that i try to skip anyways, this movie is great! I'm amused by the scenario the characters are put in. I can actually relate to Brian(the nerd). Its kind of scary though, cause he shares my name. As for the rest characters, they just made me laugh to no end. The basket case I found particularly cool. I won't comment on the emotional aspect of the film, but I will say I felt it and just leave it at that. Oh and as a 17 year old, trust me, its great to see teens actually act like teens!!!!! Now a days it seems most teen flicks are bassically movies about sex crazed monsters(no ones REALLY like that). AND IT'S NOT FUNNY, its just kind of grose.  So in conclusion, this movie was actually to my surprise good. The BEST PART is when there all dancing to We Are Not Alone by Karla Devito.  I never thought in a million years I would like a movie where some jock started crying about how he tapped some kid's bun cheeks together.

58563,3,078322687X,"I was a good little girl at school; I was never in detention. So I can't identify with this movie at all. Especially an American detention. They were there the whole of Saturday! And the antics they get up to!

I got recommended this by someone I work with, who was playing the Simple Minds on her mp3 player, and I confessed I had no idea who they were. She said they did a song on the soundtrack to this, I said I'd never seen it, and she told me to get it. So I did.

None of the actors have really done much since this film, apart from Emilio Estevez, who is still floating around out there. There's been lots of fuss about a sequel, but I doubt that will ever happen. It doesn't really warrant a sequel. Which means they will make a sequel or a remake. And that will ruin it.

Basically you have five teenage stereotypes - the rebel (Bender), the princess (Claire), the jock (Andy), the brain (Brian), and the outcast (Allison) - who would never normally associate with each other, but they get stuck together in detention. It can be a bit overacted, and a bit melodramatic at times, but yes, it works. My favourite character was the outcast, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy. She actually reminded me quite a lot of myself during high school (and at the beginning of college), hiding behind her fringe, coat, whatever comes to hand, and not speaking to anyone. Her haircut was practically the same as mine too! And the dandruff/snow on the drawing scene was absolutely classic! The reasons they all get into detention are a bit strange as well: Bender: pulls a false fire alarm; Brian: flare gun goes off in his locker; Andy: tapes a guy's butt cheeks together in the locker room; Claire: ditches class to go shopping; and Allison: didn't do anything, she didn't have anything better to do on a Saturday. (That last bit made the character for me.)

The rest of the movie is pretty much forgettable, apart from the dancing sequence, which is so funny.

If you recognise yourself in these characters, or know someone else who was that particular stereotype, then I would recommend getting it. It's easy enough to while away an hour or so watching. It will also show what you're really like depending which character is your favourite. What does your favourite reveal about you? It's a shame I'm not old enough to remember the 80s (ha!) I was born halfway through, and wasn't old enough to know about the whole Rat Pack phenomenon.

Conversely, they were perhaps inadvertently panning themselves, because in a supreme bit of irony, they failed to understand why teens at the time responded so deeply to this movie. The very themes that the 5 kids dealt with in the movie and the lack of empathy on the critics' part underscored the gap between them and the Gen X'ers. For those of us who grew up at that time, the feelings of displacement and dysfunctional parental pressures were very, very real.

They play five high school students who have to give up half of their weekend to spend a Saturday detention at their school. The characters have nothing in common and obviously don't know each other when they get together for the detention, but they surely get to know each other quite a bit. Paul Gleason (who passed away last year, played Mr. Vernon, the principal) is great as well. When Mr. Vernon leaves the room, you can just imagine what goes on amongst the five students during their detention. I first saw this movie years ago on the Encore channel back in the 90s, and thought it was so cool and funny as well. The soundtrack to the film is excellent too, including the Simple Minds song Don't You (Forget About Me). The sound and picture quality are excellent too. However, there are no extras on this DVD, such as interviews with the actors, director, or behind the scenes footage. That is kind of a bummer, but the movie is still worth watching anyway.

58568,5,078322687X,"Breakfast Club is one of the most beloved movies. All the action takes place pretty much in one room. The 'action' consists of kids talking to each other. I've seen the Breakfast Club many times over the years - if the movie were playing right now - I could mouth along and do the lines of each character.

I notice completely different things about this movie over time. Maybe we look at the world around us based upon the previous information we've been given. We've been informed that being a victim doesn't make one timid, but the opposite, tough, or pious. In a world where everyone 'reaches to grab the lowest rung of the ladder' (the lowest rung of the victim ladder) I think the focus of this movie is on John (stereotyped as the criminal). John's a bad-boy. His family is poor. He's abused at home by his dad. At one point in the movie Claire (the princess) says of John, ""Just ignore him"". John replies, ""You couldn't ignore me if you tried""

When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here (of course the movie is trying to make a point that they are all victims). Brian doesn't get the girl. John and Andy (the jock) often treat Brian as completely irrelevant. Even the school principle, caught up in events, refers to Brian as 'peewee' a couple of times.

It only took me 20 years to notice, and, I'm a nerd myself. A society obsessed with victimhood should at least get right who the victims are.

The song that went with the movie was, 'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds. I think, in the end, I always remember Brian - the other kids asking him to do their assignments; in a sense, asking Brian to speak up for them - Claire saying, 'We trust you'.

58588,5,078322687X,"I just watched ""The Breakfast Club"" this morning and was absolutely blown away!  The hype for this film is HUGE, but, incredibly, it lives up to its reputation.

""The Breakfast Club"" tells the story of five teenagers, all serving Saturday detentions.  Each of these five teens represent a high school clique - there's a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.  Stuck in their school for eight hours, the students come to discover things about eachother and ultimately become friends.

The actors are superbly cast in their roles, and in a film with so few characters, proper casting seems doubly important.  The script flows wonderfully, covering diverse topics without glitches or awkward transitions.  The soundtrack is also refreshingly upbeat.

""The Breakfast Club"" is not an average teen chick-flick, as one might expect.

Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied.

Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities.

It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB.

A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic.

Beings that I wasn't born until the year this film was released my idea of high school life finds no merit in this film whatsoever and I in no way shape or form can relate.  Thus I can't agree with the above statement.

The film is about a group of kids from all walks of life getting stuck in detention one Saturday.  None of them are friends and most of them can't stand each other but by the end of the day they realize that they are all alike in many ways and become close friends.  There's Andy (Estevez) the jock and Brian (Hall) the brain and John (Nelson) the bully and Claire (Ringwald) the rich girl and Allison (Sheedy) the weird girl.  Under the strict watch of Principal Richard Vernon (Gleason) the group is commanded to stay silent and write a paper explaining who they are.

The problem is none of them really know who they are.

The premise of the film is a good one and holds promise for a great movie, and I feel that if it were tackled now it would hold a lot more weight.  To me the majority of the acting was overacted and came across forced and amateur, but then again, acting has improved so much over the course of 20+ years.  That's not in anyway meant to slam this movie.  It's hard to judge a movie like this critically since it's so well loved and praised by the general public, but I have to be honest and say that I expected a little more, with all the hype that is.  After I finished watching it I asked a bunch of my friends (all of whom are in their 30's) what they thought of this film and none of them cared for it.

So I guess it wasn't just me.

A word of advise...if you're not a child of the 80's, and I mean that as in `if you weren't a high school student during the 80's' then you won't get out of this movie all that you are meant to.  Sure, the moral still holds weight today and it's a subject (the whole acceptance thing and learning to find common grounds and not judging others just because their different than you...) that needs to be addressed...I just think it's been addressed in better ways before.

In this classic story, five teens from different social classes come together for eight hours of secluded Saturday detention at Shermer High. At first, they are all tense and annoyed that they have to be there. But as the hours ware on, they begin to learn more about themselves then they ever knew.

Mr. Vernon, an uptight, child-hating principal keeps a close watch on the group from across the hall. Each time he decides to make an entrance, another classic quote is deveoped. ""Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?"" John Bender, the high school burnout asks him and a sarcastic tone. This movie's scrips is so well written, that in every scene something that will always be remembered is said.

This story teaches about learning to accept people who are different from you.

58610,5,078322687X,When I told my Year 9s that a film I was going to show them about the worries and insecurities of a group of teens was made in 1985 they thought it would be a bore. I showed it to them and a few wanted to know where I bought it. The best movie made in the 80s. Period.,1152057600,,268,3.559322033898305
58611,5,078322687X,"There was an abundance of teen films in the 1980s.  That was one of the defining parts of the decade.  Though many of those were great - and many were terrible - few came close to the greatness of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Since its release in 1985, it has become a contemporary classic, winning over viewers for more than twenty years.  As of yesterday, I am one of the countless viewers in love with this film.

THE BREAKFAST CLUB spans eight hours on a grey Saturday, where five teenagers are gathering at Shermer High School for detention.  At first glance, this is how they appear: Andy (Emilio Estevez) is just another jock.  Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is a nerd, a brain, a geek.  Bender (Judd Nelson) is a rude, rambunctious troublemaker.  Claire (Molly Ringwald) is a stuck-up rich girl.  Allison (Ally Sheedy) is odd, quiet, disturbed, the precursor to the Gothic girl.  These five kids go into Shermer High with nothing in common, but when they come out, their lives will be changed forever.

John Hughes is universally acknowledged to be the King of Teen Movies, but he's much more.  He is a very talented writer and director, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is clear, undeniable evidence of this.  The script is very likely one of the greatest ever written, filled with great dialogue including memorable moments of humor and shocking moments of drama.  Hughes' directing wrings out Academy Award-worthy performances from the cast - which is, of course, stellar.  Hall is probably the most likable of the bunch, but Nelson is the most amusing.  His character is one whom we hate, then laugh with, then sympathize with, then hate again, and finally, love.  Sheedy's character is delightfully weird.  Paul Gleason is perfectly hateable as Principal Vernon, and John Kapelos is perfectly likable as Carl the janitor.

THE BREAKFAST CLUB is emotional, shocking, and filled with dialogue that is undeniably true.  The cast is great, the script is brilliant, the directing is top-notch, the editing is seamless, and to top it off there's a great soundtrack including music by Simple Minds and Wang Chung.  This is not only the ultimate 80s teen flick - it may very well be one of the greatest films ever made.  Highly recommended.",1151020800,,2225,4.843501326259947

The freshness remains 21 years on and there is also now the added commentry on 80's life.

 A time when fear of the world's demise began to ring home and as such affected a disillusionment in western youth at perhaps a greater a degree than ever before seen.

 This is strikingly in evidence here and it is aided and embelished by a range of powerful, candid and comedic performances.

58618,5,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places).

Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well ""not even exist at the school"", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents.

The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas.

The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on.

58619,5,078322687X,"Ok, I was four years old when this movie came out.  I graduated High School in 2000, so I wasn't a teenager when I saw it.  I heard about it from my best friend Pete(whom I met in college), so I decided to check it out; I am an enormous 80's film fan.  This movie is incredibly powerful and penetrating.  They used to call movies 'moving pictures', but few actually fit the bill; this does.  It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, with it's believable characters and frank discussion of mature issues.  It has quickly become one of my favorite all time movies. I would not recommend this to the younger crowd only because of the occasional strong profanity, but for everyone else, this is a must see.

The plot is talking about five teenagers who wind up in detention together one fall afternoon in 1984.  Each one of them represents a certain ilk of society: An intellectual(anthony michael hall), an athelete(emilio esteves), a loner(ally sheedy), a criminal(judd nelson), and a prep(molly ringwald).  As the day progresses, they bare their souls to each other, each telling their own story.  They begin to understand that, though they found themselves as different as water and oil, they have a lot more in common then they realized.  Some of the one-liners were so funny that I had to listen to them multiple times: particularly from the 'criminal'.  He constantly insults the others, playing on their intelligence or their looks, one of the funniest of which is when he is poking fun at the intellectual; he goes though his lunch and, seeing how 'wholesome' it is, asks if his mom married Mr. Rogers(funny!).  But the criminal has a tragic side too: he comes from a physically and emotionally abusive home, which he reveals in one scene when he pulls up his shirt sleeve and reveals a cigar burn on his arm.  The others have similar problems: The loner is grossly neglected; the intellectual feels like he has to contantly impress his parents; the athelete has issues with his father, whom has a negative attitude about what he considers ""weakness""; and the prep struggles with peer pressure put on by her particular ""click"".  In the end, they become friends,and the movie ended with the intellectual saying: 'dear Mr. Vernan, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice an entire saturday in detention for whatever it is we did wrong.  But we think you're crazy for you telling us to tell you who we think we are.  You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest term, in the most convenient definitions.  But what we discovered is each one of us is a brain, and an athelete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.  Does that answer your question? Sincerely, The Breakfast club.""

The movie is now over twenty years old, and it doesn't feel old. The first half hour or so, you may feel like you're watching a teenage movie, but the plot thickens a bit as it evolves and the definite personalities of the five characters float to the surface, baring their souls to each other and the viewer. You will find yourself finding one (or more) of them with whom you will be able to identify with. In my case it was Brian (the nerd), but you may find you had more in common with the ones depicting the athlete, the basket case, the princess or the criminal.

The rick kid is played by Molly Ringwald, whose parents are always away on some exotic vacation, whose mother is alcoholic and goes completely ignored.

The jock is played by Emilio Estevez, who is popular, but can never please his dad no matter how hard he tries at being the best athlete.

There's the lonely, ""crazy"" girl played by Ally Sheedy, who goes ignored by everyone and her parents, too.

There's the so-called geek, who makes straight-A's, and is always under constant pressure like the jock to be perfect.

Finally, there's the loner/rebel, who is physically and verbally abused by his dad played by Judd Nelson.

All of these kids from diverse backgrounds have Saturday detention from the morning until the afternoon and learn from each other, while sitting in the library all day how much they really have in common; despite, their diverse social backgrounds.

They all realize that they're ignored or mistreated to some extent by their parents and always being expected to be the best with the exception of Ally Sheedy's character, who is only in detention because ""I didn't have anything better to do.""

I am sure that any American student, who's either currently in high school, or has already graduated from high school can definintely relate to these stereotypical characters.

The movie is excellent and while it seems that the plot is not deep because it's not that thought-provoking, the music is great and the film is awesome!

John Hughes' movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that ""The Breakfast Club"" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic. If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.

If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days. Think about your last year there.

58637,4,078322687X,"Although it's a tough call to say which of the John Hughes movies had the most heart in them - as he did choose a medium of completely vain and self centered teenagers - I believe The Breakfast Club was probably the most artisticly inclined and showcased the most talent of them all.

A bunch of kids from the same high school from different walks of life and social casts have come together for a Saturday of detention.  They are an unusual mix of people (a Weirdo, a Delinqent, a Nerd, a Princess, and a Jock) all put together in one room for a day.  Here they are forced to look at each other which contemplating their detention assignment - writing an essay about what makes them them.  This was obviously meant to punish, but turns them into talking about themselves in ways they otherwise wouldn't and the play unfolds.

It was odd to see Molly Ringwald here as the snotty popular girl when she is perhaps more famous for being the outcast.  Here she will only speak to the Jock as she considers him to be her equal and not the others until the Delinquent Judd Nelson bullies his way into cracking her shell.  And eating sushi for lunch with chopsticks?  That's a little strange.  Ally Sheedy, however, stole this movie in my opinion.  She is the sullen, twitching creep in the back.  The sandwich!  Who can forget that?!  And using her own dandruff on the drawing of the snowy day!  And we find out she wasn't in detention, she just didn't have anything else to do that day!!!  HA!  Anthony Michael Hall reappeared as the drooling Nerd once again, but he was probably the most dangerous of them all as he was in detention for bringing a gun to school.  And the Jock, Emilio Estevez, which is a sort of bad guy is actually pretty likable.

Why not 5 stars?  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson as the Delinquent was just exactly that.  He was annoying, obnoxious, insecure, and proved nothing except that his bad behavior earned him the next six months of detention Saturdays.  He was a rebel without  a clue.  Know what's really scary though?  I remember my first real boyfriend used to look and dress like him, he even had those gloves with the fingers cut off if I remember correctly.  *Yikes!*",1128384000,,2193,4.488607594936709

Hughes use of kids from different backgrounds and social standing is the key, and he explores it masterfully.

58651,5,078322687X,"In the mid 1980s, a group of young actors and actresses called ""The Brat Pack"" would emerge.  Different members of this group would appear in films together.  These roles would range from high school teenagers to young adults.  At the same time, a young writer, producer, and director named John Hughes was beginning to make a name for himself with such movies as ""Mr. Mom"", ""Vacation"", ""European Vacation"", and ""Weird Science"".  The combination of John Hughes and The Brat Pack would come together for the 1985 movie ""The Breakfast Club"".  What would be an inexpensive movie would not only become a surprise hit, but one that would stand the test of time for two decades.  The reason for this movie standing the test of time is that it is a movie that both teenagers and adults who were once teenagers could relate to.

The plot of this movie is very simple.  The story of this film takes place over an 8 hour period on March 24, 1984 at the fictional Shermer High School in the fictional Chicago suburb of Shermer Illinois.  If you have followed John Hughes' films, you will know that Shermer Illinois has been used in several of his movies (examples include ""Weird Science"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Sixteen Candles"").  It is on that date that 5 High School students, each from different backgrounds come together for a detention session.  When the detention session starts; Richard Vernon (played by Paul Gleason) the teacher in charge tells the 5 students to write a 1000 word essay explaining ""who they think they are"".  As the detention session begins, the students are quiet, but then the obvious frictions that come from the different backgrounds of each of the students soon will surface.  However it is from those frictions that each of the students will soon get to know each other, and some bonding begins to surface.  The students will soon realize they have similar problems when it comes to peer pressure and home life.

It is the five members that come from the Brat Pack that give the film its charm:  Emilio Estevez as Andrew, the high school jock;  Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,  the brainy nerd;  Molly Ringwald as Claire the preppy 'princess';  Ally Sheedy as Allison, the psycho ""basket case""; and Judd Nelson as John Bender, as the troublemaker.  In particular it is Judd Nelson's performance as Bender that really stands out.  Perhaps because ""The Breakfast Club"" was both a John Hughes and Brat Pack movie is why this performance was overlooked.  Nelson's performance was outstanding and probably even warranted some Oscar consideration.  Looking back at the film some 20 years later, you really see what a great performance it is.  Bender also provides some of the film's lighter moments - in particular when he squares off with Vernon.  However it is also Bender that really breaks the ice in the film.  It is actually a result of Bender's sarcasm that the dialogue begins between the five students.  At first, the other four do not like Bender (and vice versa), but as the bonding begins in the film, it is interesting to see how Bender will take the blame for some mischief by the group - as well as the group covering for Bender's antics.

There are other outstanding performances in this movie as well.  Molly Ringwald is very believable in her role as the preppy as is Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd.  Next to Nelson's performance, it is probably Ally Sheedy's role as Allison the ""basket case"" that stands out.  Allison is a strange character - one who is very quiet at the beginning.  Therefore the character of Allison is going to have to rely more on physical motion.  Sheedy pulls this off brilliantly.  Estevez also does a good job playing the jock - the scene that he explains why he is in detention is outstanding.

While this film does a great job at a character study among the five students, this film does a character study from the adult perspective - namely around the character of Richard Vernon.  This comes in a scene with Carl the Janitor.  We get some insight into why Vernon got into teaching, and how things didn't go the way they expected.  While Carl might only be a janitor, he provides Vernon with a lot of insight into himself.

One thing that John Hughes does very well is integrate music into the movie.  While the music takes a secondary role to the story, the music is used at the right time with the right scene.  Keith Forsey, a producer who works with Billy Idol was in charge of the music with this song.  ""The Breakfast Club"" would feature the monster-hit by Simple Minds called ""Don't You (Forget About Me"") (This song would launch Simple Minds' career in the United States).  The instrumentation of this song is simply brilliant.  Listen to how the drum beats and keyboards play perfectly in the movie.  Another great song that didn't get nearly as much attention was Karla DeVito's ""We Are Not Alone"".  This song is used during a ""rebellious"" scene in the movie - and it fits perfect.

One scene that happens toward the end of the movie is when Hall's character of Brian asks the question ""Will we all be friends when we go to school on Monday?""  This scene is crafted so well by Hughes - and it's a scene that any teenager or former teenager has been exposed to.  In a way, that scene is almost a symbol of the entire movie.

Overall, this is a movie that I find myself watching over and over.  Each successive time I watch it, I find something new.  In a way, I would have loved to have seen an official sequel to see what happens when they all get back to school.  This is a movie I highly recommend.",1125187200,10,5585,4.621951219512195

Wanting nothing to do with each other, they nevertheless begin to interact and, by the end of the day, they have learned a great deal about themselves and the others, completely shattering the concept of a stereotype.

There's a 5-star movie here screaming to get out, as exemplified by the wonderful scene in which the kids just sit down on the floor and talk about themselves and challenge each others assumptions.  It's hampered by many lesser elements, such as one-dimensional adult characters and silly posing (such as the MTV flavored dance scenes, which are unrealistic and painfully bad).

Anyway, these 5 teens were from COMPLETELY different circles and, although they had seen eachother in the halls, and had heard rumors about eachother, none of them REALLY knew what the others were about.  So, they start off thinking that each one is totally different from them, and so they are each pretty snobby to the others.

There's 1 ""tough guy"", 1 ""geek"", 1 ""jock"", 1 ""glamour girl"", and 1 ""weird/loner chick"".  Due to the fact that they all HATED the teacher who was watching over them, they wound up coming together to go against him.  It's during this process that they come to learn about eachother's home & school life - they learn about eachothers hurts, thoughts & fears.  And, through this, they realize that they're not so different after all.

So, will they continue to be friends after this day of in-school suspension is over?  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you've never seen it, but suffice it to say that you'll probably never forget the ending to ""The Breakfast Club"" - I don't know of anyone who has - even 20 years later...

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage-type movies - it makes as much sense today as it did 20 years ago (only the styles have changed).  I would also recommend it to anyone who was a teen during the 1980's - it will bring up a lot of great (or not-so-great) memories of your highschool years.",1121472000,2,1745,4.504761904761905

You like Brian, although he is a geek, but you know that even he has his negative perceptions about the ""criminal"" like everyone has about him.

Sure, Andy's a jock, but he is also a nice guy-a rarity. Claire hates doing what her friends want her to do, and so she is not as independent and envy worthy as eveyone may think a popular girl should be. And Alison-the ""basketcase"" (does anyone use that term anymore?) she is just odd, but like claire, we don't find her disturbing, or ""cool"" as she says either, just kind of....different, and for that, she is just as likable.

Why is this movie great? first, it is hilarious with the one-liners from Bender (Judd Nelson).Brian played by Anthony Michael Hall is a nerd in this movie, but a cool dork. Look for the scene when he responds to Bender's question why (brian) is in the physics club. Ally Sheedy playing the nutcase is funny when she dumps her dandruff on her art. Molly Ringwald is funny just being the stereotypical  stuck up ""princess."" Estevez is the cool-head in this movie.

Finally, the song, ""Don't You Forget About Me"" performed by Simple Minds fits perfectly with the movie. It plays at the beginning with the introduction of the actors and credits. However, it is effectively appropos when it's played at the end when everyone resolves their differences while Verner reads Brian's letter. The movie being filmed in a real high school in the suburbs of Illinois is effective as well.

Teenagers and kids today will realize how bad they have it with the no talent hip hop crap artists they listen to and the crappy movies they see nowadays. SInce the 80's ended, the music has been horrible. People viewing this movie will discover why the 80's had great songs and artists.

58675,5,078322687X,"One of the defining movies of the 80's decade, The Breakfast Club remains an entertaining film which evokes nostalgia among many viewers. Inevitably, any foray into the cinema blockbusters of the 1980s will evoke a number of titles, such as Back To The Future, Beverly Hills Cop, or The Goonies. The Breakfast Club is certainly one of those films, and it's almost universally cited as one of the preeminent films from the era. If you enjoy relationship films, it's easy to see why, because The Breakfast Club is a movie built solely on the strength of its characters and the conflict surrounding them...

Shermer High School principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) oversees the Saturday morning detention of five high school students from differing backgrounds. Confining them to the library, he fails to relate to them as individuals with a future or a purpose. Making up the cast of misfit characters are Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez), Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwold), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). Forced to spend their Saturday together, the five students strike up a conversation (with the exception of the muted Allison). For the most part, their conversation consists of picking on each other and making jokes at each other's expense.

Continually butting heads with Principal Vernon, the teens help pass the time by uniting against Vernon and by engaging in conversation with the infinitely wise janitor, Carl (John Kapelos). Eventually, each student (including Allison, who eventually opens up) comes to understand the plight of the other. The pretty princess Claire doesn't have a perfect life. Neither does the popular wrestling champ Andy. Brian and Allison have their own problems just like anyone else, and John puts up a front to look tougher and more hardened than he really is. In the end, the five develop a lifelong bond - with Claire and John igniting a budding relationship...

Sporting a smash hit soundtrack headlined by Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me),"" The Breakfast Club attained instant cult classic status. The 'brat pack' came to define a generation and made its mark in Hollywood. A light-hearted comedy, blended together with a series of relationships between different people, The Breakfast Club's true strength lies with the ability of its audience to relate to the issues at hand. The characters recount stories from their lives that in one way or another are easily relatable to most every American who attended high school.

It's this universal familiarity with the themes depicted by The Breakfast Club that make it a classic adored by millions. Despite the longings of teenagers throughout time to forge unique identities and set themselves aside as revolutionary, in the end, most high schools sport the same cast of characters, and those various roles have remained unchanged for most of the last several decades. As one of the most memorable films of the 80's decade, The Breakfast Club is a definite must-see movie...

58697,5,078322687X,"John Hughes, the director of the highly successful ""Sixteen Candles"" has created a masterpiece of a movie that had remained popular for twenty years.  This movie focuses on five high school students who are to spend a Saturday in detention for whatever it was that they did wrong.  At the beginning of the day, they didn't even know each other's names, but by the end, they had bared their souls, explained their dreams, and became friends.

Judd Nelson (Bender), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Molly Ringwald (Claire) and Ally Sheedy (Allison) star as the students, while Paul Gleason stars as principal Richard Vernon.  At 7 am, the students enter the library, not knowing each other, but as the movie progresses, they learn more and more about each other so that by the end of the day, they all realize that there is a little bit of everyone in each of them.  Bender is the ""criminal"", suffering from a bad homelife, abusive parents, and a lack of self-esteem.  Brian is the ""brain"", who believes in studying hard and getting good grades, but he's also a geek.  Andrew is the ""jock"".  He is frustrated because he feels that he must live up to his father's high expectations for him.  He snaps under the pressure that his father placed on him.  Claire is the ""princess"".  She feels that she's better than everyone, and has the best of everything.  Allison is the ""basket case"".  Like Bender, she is suffering from low self-esteem, so she lies to cover up her insecurities.

It is amazing to watch the transformation of these characters, especially the relationship between Claire and Bender.  Although he constantly harasses her throughout the movie, deep down Bender really likes and cares for Claire.  As the movie progresses, the characters soon realize that they all have a little of the same characteristics of each other, such as the scene where they are running from Vernon in the halls and Bender asks Claire how it feels to be bad.  Then they display some of Bender's characteristics by sitting and smoking marajuana.

There are several funny points in the film as well, such as Bender crashing through the ceiling while telling a joke, and the constant harassment that Vernon faced.  Also, who can forget the great song by Simple Minds?

This is a great movie.  The story is excellent and well-developed.  The acting is first-rate, but I thought that Judd Nelson did an especially good job as Bender.  I give this movie a very high recommendation.  To the outside world they were simply the jock, the criminal, the princess, the brain, and the basket case, but to each other, they would always be the breakfast club.",1109808000,5,2652,4.816371681415929

They gradually become part of each other's world, by learning about their fears, their home lives, their dreams, and their talents (making odd sandwiches, rolling joints, applying lipstick with their breasts, etc).

58703,5,078322687X,"The breakout movie for the 80's brat pack is one with many teenage issues

that can still be attributed with teens today. John Hughes' signature film

focuses on the harshness of high school social groups and how they affect people,

especially the teens who don't really know who they are yet.

""The Breakfast Club,"" is a movie that brings together 5 socially different

teens from fictitious Shermer High School, based on Hughes' high school

Glenbrook North in north suburban Chicago. The movie is about these students during

an all-day Saturday detention and their struggles with authority and accepting

one another. At the beginning of the day, they are given an assignment to

explain who they thought they were. And by talking to each other and baring their

souls, they realize, they are what everyone see's them as, and that it doesn't

matter what anyone else thinks, as long as they are happy. As said before,

all these students come from a different social group; each filling a

stereotypical role; the popular girl, the jock, the rebel, the nerd and the

weirdo.

All while sitting through detention, they realize how similar they are,

despite their obvious differences. Each of these teens are trying to figure out

who they are, all while trying to prove themselves in the eyes of those most

critical of them (parents, teachers, friends, coaches, etc.) By spending one magical day together, they learn and grow close through experiences and talking, even though they would never talk to each other normally. As the film winds down, you can't help but wonder if this would ever happen in real life. As much as the fantasy of movie life is intriguing, you know  ti can't be real. And the movie gives false hope to the thought that judgmental teenagers will all get along and work through their problems. But who said a little fantasy is a bad thing. Thinking of one's own high school experience brings back the memories of the cliques and social groups that were there, and this is the movie that defined each group in a high school.

Some of the issues that are brought to attention in the film are drug abuse,

parental divorce, peer pressure, and attempted suicide. Each of these issues

can still be and are easily issues that are present today among teens. As seen in the film, high school is stressful enough, but with outside pressure and forces it can make it the hardest time in anyone's life. This movie not only described teenage angst in one generation, it defined it for all

teenagers at any time.

 This movie is a great reference point for high school. Granted it has since been spoofed for its generalizations and full story line, it is still an 80's classic. If you have not seen it it comes highly recommended. ""The Breakfast Club,"" is a great movie, but just don't take my word for it, see it for yourself!",1097452800,,2845,4.72210953346856

The movie has sex, drugs and a little bit of rock and roll, but it still comes out with a message at the end, expressed so aptly by its opening song ""Don't you Forget About Me.""

The moves shows five teens on a day of Saturday detention. Claire, the rich, popular, prom queen ""princess"" played by Molly Ringwold, Andy, the also popular varsity wrestler ""Jock""(Emilio Estevez), Allison (Ally Sheedy), the sullen, quiet, strange ""basket case"", Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the quintessential nerdy ""brain"", and John Bender (Judd Nelson), a rowdy, rough edged, devil may care criminal. All of these diverse characters are put together in Saturday detention, and they see each other in terms ofthese stereotypes, just as the principal sees them. Their interactions reflect the reality of most high schools, the beauty queens certainly don't interact with the nerds and the loners, and no jock is going to be caught dating a ""basket case"", or is he?

However, when the teens are asked to write  1,000 word essay about who they are, the kids start to see these stereotypes for what they are. As the movie progresses, the teens discover that they have a lot more in common than they thought, and eventually overcome their differences, at least for a day and become frineds, but will the frinedship last on monday morning when the peer pressure comes in? it's left up to your imagination to figure out, but the Saturday we spend with the kids from Shermer, Illinois is one where we learn a lot about ourselves and see something we can all relate to, but don't often voice.

The movie is fantastic, but the DVD leaves much to be desired. There is no director's commentary, nor deleted scenes and special features.

It is horrible! - and this coming from a man who loves all things 80's! Was Judd Nelson about 35 when he made that movie? He looks about 20 years older than Anthony Michael Hall. Unbelievable characters and dialogue. Then they tie it up nice and neat at the end - with 2 unlikely couples pairing off leading us to believe there's no social caste in high schools.

With the small cast and lack of location shots, I'm amazed that I've never read about some high school drama club doing a stage production of this disaster. In any case, I've got a Breakfast Club DVD I'll never watch again - I'll post it under ""Used & New"" above.",1088985600,23,1097,4.294685990338165
58718,5,078322687X,"Some question the durability of ""The Breakfast Club,"" saying that the themes and plotlines do not hold up in today's teen society. As a 15-year-old, I would like to say that that is thoroughly untrue. 19 years after its release, ""The Breakfast Club"" is still a truthful, relateable account of teenagers and their personalities, and the ways in which they interact with each other. Sure, the stereotypes of the characters may be a bit exaggerated -- but that's necessary in order to get the point across. Watching this movie, I feel as if I know these people, or at least I've run across them at one point in my high school career.
The plot, as most people know, involves five different kids being assigned Saturday detention together. Each kid represents a typical high school stereotype -- a princess (Molly Ringwald), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a brain (Anthony Michael Hall), a basket case (the excellent Ally Sheedy), and a criminal (Judd Nelson). At the beginning of the day, none of them know each other, except for the princess and the jock. Throughout the day, they learn more about each other and work at tearing down the stereotypes that pit them against each other. As for the reviewer who said this isn't realistic that they would open up so much to each other -- it absolutely is. Put five kids into a room without an adult for nine hours, and they will talk about anything.
The beauty of this movie is the depth of the characters beyond the stereotypes -- particularly the nerd, Brian, who as we find out in the movie has problems well beyond what people think of him. He is the one that I most relate to in the movie. Watch ""The Breakfast Club,"" and see who you most relate to. It's a great experience. Beyond the social commentary aspect, it's also just a funny movie. The jokes come at breakneck speed, especially for the first half of the movie (before it gets somewhat serious). The actors are also very enjoyable in their roles, particularly Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall. Highly recommended.",1088553600,53,2017,4.700564971751413
58719,5,078322687X,"The quintessential John Hughes film.  I remember in my English class my junior year (1987) we had to analyze this movie.  Only 2 years after it's release it was had all the qualities needed for a class analysis.  I will spare you the report that I did back then.
Since then I have watched this movie at least once a year (and contrary to popular believe it is not for the panty shot).  The characters are very well done.  There is something that anyone who went through high school can relate to, even if we fit more than just one character.  The interactions between the teens towards each other and then towards the principal as a group is classic.  It's got love, teen angst, popular kids, geeks, dweebs, outcasts and the ever popular kid that doesn't fit in but always tries to get the attention.  Nothing like dumping out your bag for people to go through to get attention.
Of course you can't forget the star cast of strong 80's actors, Emilio Estevez  (Andrew 'Andy') Anthony Michael Hall (Brian) Judd Nelson (John Bender) Molly Ringwald (Claire) Ally Sheedy (Allison) and Paul Gleason (Principal).  Great acting, John's look at teenagers and a great script all make for a very enjoyable look at the interactions and `attitude' typical of the high school years.

All things aside,all the actors give their best performances since...well,since ever! Molly Ringwald gives a great performance as a bittersweet daddy's girl(the princess),Emilio Estevez is phenomenal as the football player who is overpushed by his dad(the jock),Anthony Michael Hall is hilarious,as usual(the nerd),Judd Nelson probably does the best acting out of the bunch(the criminal),and everyone I know loves the basketcase(Alison Sweeney).And,the villain of the movie(the principal),is great as the (...) who's sick of his job. The greatness of this movie,though,is the perfect balancing of comedy and drama in here. I mean,all these students come in here,thinking they are never going to survive with these  ""less important"" groups in their way,but come out being best friends after hours of crying and letting out stuff they needed to let out a long time ago;it's amazing how much the jock,the princess,the basketcase(who later changes into a pretty girl),the nerd,and the criminal change throughout the whole movie. And the criminal is maybe the best one in the whole movie,showing that ""hoodlums""(as people call them)hurt,too,and are not just doing bad things for a good time,which really needed to be showcased at that time period.
Flaws:One of the outcomes are really shallow(Emilio Estevez's character all of a sudden falling in love with Alison Sweeney's characters after she pretties herself up),and this is really only intended for people who were teens in the '80's and later. Oh,and the film is EXTREMELY easy to make fun of,which may not really be a flaw after all.

This film is about five very different high school students from 5 very different crowds who all end up in detention together. Each of these students is played by well known actors like Molly Ringlwald, Emilio Estevez and Judd Nelson. Through the courses of the movie, not only do the students learn something about one another and learn to ignore the usual social barriers that contain them, they each also learn something very important about themselves.

Here was a film that presents five students who initially come across as cardboard cliches, but who eventually reveal themselves as so much more. The writing is sharp and crisp, and apart from a few patches of overdone juvenile behavior, the dialogue flows seamlessly.
Sure, the movie has its warts. Parents are the root of all the kids' problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a somewhat prolonged but inconsequential dance sequence smooshed in.
Yet, twenty two years on, the movie still rings as true as ever because school life remains essentially the same -- same sorts of conflict between generations, private fears often undisclosed to the outside world, worries about their futures nagging them, etc etc.
A truly enjoyable, clever brat-pack character study. Special highlight -- the popular Simple Minds number ""Don't You Forget About Me"".",1082246400,10,1178,5.140625
58737,3,078322687X,"The breakfast club is without doubt the biggest mixed bag of a film that i have ever seen. Its good in the way that its the most 80's film that you'll ever see, and its bad in the way that it's the most 80's film that you'll ever see. In other words its good in places but cheesy as tangy cheesy cheese in others.
The story itself to me is pretty ludicrous, five kids get detention and then over the course of the film become close freinds after they express their deepest emotions to each other. Now maybe im just too much of a cynic but i can honestly say that in all the times that i was in detention i didn't want to talk to anyone.
The acting is also really bad yet good in its own 80's way. The performances from Judd Nelson and the Teacher guy are so over the top that these guys cant even see planet earth anymore,and thats not me being sarcastic thats me being truthful, I apologise to all the people who hold John Bender close to their soul, its just my opinion, I am a rudos luchadore after all.
The only real grudge that i have with this film is the soundtrack, I apologise again but that Simple Minds song makes me want to chainsaw my own face off.
But I can see past that and appreciate what is a quite enjoyable film, just don't expect an experience that films like Kill Bill, LotR, Night of the living dead, and True Romance will give you just expect a good way to waste a few hours.",1080259200,,1399,4.128205128205129

58739,5,078322687X,"""The Breakfast Club"" is on of the few brat-pack movies that really depict high school life. I love it for that, you meet stoners and weirdos and criminals and geeks and jocks and and and.... the list could go on for ever on how this film depicts each cliche. I love all of the actors, how each of them really get into the character and how they depict them (boy! I'm sure using the word depict alot today aren't I?) This is a great movie for young people. I love it so much.
Five Kids are stuck in a painful saturday detention, a criminal, a jock, a geek, a prom queen and a weirdo gothic girl. As the day goes on they discuss controversal issues, such as sex before marrige, crime, drugs and politics and eithical stuff. When the day begins they hate each other don't trust each other and stereotype each other. But as the day goes on they talk and learn their strengths differences and rights and wrongs and they all change each others lives. There is a mean detention teacher that harasses them and is very cruel yet they stay strong.
The brat-pack kids were never expected to make a movie as good as this is. I was impressed, I'm a huge movie watched and I thought this was going to be just you know, swear drugs and bathroom humor. But it isn't its real life in real scenarios. There is strong language and drug content. So keep it away from the little ones. Perfect for anyone in high school.

58749,3,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club is a damn enjoyable film. It stands out as a classic of its genre, the '80s teen movie, the ""brat pack"" flicks exemplified in the films of John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). In Hughes's world, the grown-ups are exposed as morons, and here it is Paul Gleason as high school Principal Richard Vernon (""Does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?"") as the token object of humiliation.
In The Breakfast Club, five students find themselves thrown together for a Saturday detention. Throughout the course of the day they fight, they cause mischief, they laugh, they cry, they get high, and they wind up discovering that as different as they are from each other on the surface -- the rich kid, the geek, the troublemaker -- underneath they're the same ordinary kids going through the same ordinary struggles.
You may have to ignore some of the amoral implications of the story to appreciate it. And you will have to find it in your heart to forgive the cheesiness as Hughes presents every cliche of his era one by one. Overlook some of the utter implausibilities and absurdities the film throws at us.

I was the basket case in the real world so she was the one who I could identify with the most because some people just shut me out and looked at me funny and was reffered to by some as a weirdo.
 I could also relate to the brain because in Senior high I was setting goals and things and receiving good grades even though I was in special ed. I could just relate to the pressure of having the challenges of school assignments.
The princess was someone who I thought was cute but someone I felt miles apart from. She was hot but I just wasn't interested in anything else about her.
The jock was much of the same just someone I could care less about and couldn't identify with at all but I did sort of cry when the jock in this movie told his tale of the sinful things he did to a fellow student.
The criminal was someone who I was interested in but didn't necessarily wish to hang out with him because I was scared of his love of marijuana and rebellious attitude even though I was rebellious and proud of it because he was rebellious in a way that got him into trouble.

Either this movie hasn't aged well, or like Ally Sheedy said `When you grow up, your heart dies'. I just don't get the emotional connection to this film like I used too, I guess that's because I'm in my thirties now with a kid of my own. It is nostalgic to watch what life was like back in the 80's. I think almost everyone my age misses those days. The movies, the music, the fashions, everything was great. It was a great time to be a teen. This film just isn't realistic anymore, sure you still have the princesses, the jocks, the brains, the basketcases, and the criminals, but the times have changed. These days the John Bender would have physically attacked or shoot the teacher. The basketcase would be sitting at the back table listening to Marilyn Manson instead of looking at a Prince album. The Princess would probably be talking to her friends on a cell-phone. The brain would have found a way to sneak a laptop in and surf the net all day, and the jock would have probably, well I don't know, whatever it is that jocks do these days. I was always a cross between the basketcase, brain, and criminal anyway. Jocks and princesses never made it into my world. Which was the point of the whole movie anyway, breaking barriers.
If this was 1985 again, I'd be on Amazon saying this is a 7 star movie and was a feat of human accomplishment. But now in 2003, I have to say I can't sit through this movie again. Maybe one day if I'm feeling nostalgic and have an old girlfriend on my mind I'll pop it in, but that probably won't be for awhile. But on the other hand, I've probably watched this movie a million times already, so I must have thought it was good.
This is definitely a movie for teenagers who are trying to find themselves and have the whole world in front of them.

Each is an opposite from the other.  The group consists of a brain, a prom queen, a jock, a basket case and a trouble-maker.  A unique and unexpected bond is formed by the five teens as the day goes on, with all sorts of different states of emotion going on for each of them.  No matter happens on Monday, all five of them will always that one Saturday together; therefore, forever labeling them ""The Breakfast Club.""
Not only is this a classic film, it's one of my personal favorites.  I loved it when I was little and I love it now as I am in my twenties.  It's so refreshing to have a brutally honest film that plays on all of your emotions as this movie does.  And even though this was shot in the eighties, people can still relate to it now in 2000.  This is why it is so effective and powerful.
The movie is so memorable that you will most likely repeat every single line during each viewing.  The actors do a terrific job of portraying their roles flawlessly.  The script is funny and touching at the same time.  Everything that is shown in the movie is crucial and significant; being that there isn't a single minute in the movie that goes wasted.
This new DVD edition, while it may not be the most spectacular of DVDs, is a lot better than the previous version.  They did an excellent job of producing a successful remastered version of the movie that looks and sounds excellent.  You can even watch it in DTS; that is, if your system carries it.  I'm afraid there's not much to offer in the special features department.  It really is a shame, being that this is such a classic movie.  Still, the way the film looks and sounds is worth the price alone.

58770,2,078322687X,"""The Breakfast Club"" is the brat pack movie that I venture to guess will be long remembered as a watershed moment in American cinema - at least where teen comedy is concerned.  The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human, John Hughes ""The Breakfast Club"" is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.
UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own. Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays, this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD.  Colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing.  Fine detail is minimal, even in well lit scenes.  Contrast, shadow and black levels are all extremely weak. Age related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation.  The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation, except in the music tracks.
EXTRAS: A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.
BOTTOM LINE: ""The Breakfast Club"" is a brilliant movie.  However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice)and the really low brow treatment of the transfer lead me to say this disc really isn't worth the money.",1062460800,8,1681,5.207407407407407

I feel Buffy The Vampire Slayer put this lesson in perfect context. a boy trys to commit suicide Buffy stops him and asks him why he says ""No one cares about no one pays attention to me or my problems the popular kids don't care about how hard it is for me"" Buffy's response is "" They don't care or pay attention to your problems because they are taking care of their own!!!!!!!""

The outcasts on the bottom , and the popular at the top. As the movie develops so do the characters. This movie delivers laughs,tears,joy,and sadness. It features some drug content, language, sexual dialogue, and thematic elements. I recommend it for middle to high schoolers.
The reason I gave this movie 4 of 5 stars is because of the lack of features, I mean come on! They could have put at least a few deleted scenes or a ""making of"" documentary. There isn't even a trailer!!! I'm getting the high school reunion edition, atleast it has a trailer!",1059177600,,717,4.653543307086614

The dialogue is brilliant, funny, and provacative. ""The Breakfast Club"" is a wise, witty, and quotable film that rips into the fundamentals of teen life - cliques, parents, and sex.  It does all this with a little innuendo and some foul language (mostly from Bender), but it is ten times cleaner than most teen movies nowadays.  It's respectful while being interesting, and is one of my top ten movies.
One thing that impressed me is the way that this film stood up the test of time. These things were going on in the 80's, just as they're going on today.  This movie is great for middle to high schooler's, but I know my 40-year-old parents still enjoy it today.  It really bridges gaps.  But don't get me wrong - this movie is enjoyable and funny - any soul searching is purely voluntary. Get ""The Breakfast Club"", if only for a good laugh.",1057449600,,1010,4.4324324324324325

Five teens representing the most generic types of high schoolers(the brain, the beauty, the athlete, the criminal, and the recluse) being put together in isolation for a day and the movie follows the interactions and feelings they share with each other.  It is funny at parts and sad at parts and it almost shows that everyone can be together peacefully.  Unfortunately, it is not that way in real life, and the characters even touch on how society will break each class of people apart.  They stay true to their stereotypes in the beginning and keep apart from each other; but given time, they slowly move together until they destroy their stereotypes and labels and become the same people.  You'll love all the characters and can easily relate any of them to someone from your high school.  it touches on the minds of teens and hasn't dated a bit since the 80's in my opinion.  It is an easy movie to watch again and again as it is simple in concept, yet has a powerful underlying message of morality and society.  Recommended for all because all can relate to it.

58790,5,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club (1985)is by far the most important teen movie ever. It shows five very different high school students joined together in a Saturday detention for a variety of reasons, and for the entire day, they are STUCK together with no way out. There is the jock Andy (Emilio Estevez), the princess Claire (Molly Ringwald), the metalhead Bender (Judd Nelson), the basketcase Allison (Ally Sheedy), and the nerdy straight A student Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), five very different personalities, egos and reasons for being here (skipping class, firearms, constant rebellion, bullying and ennui), so they get to know each other, which was a hard process because all 5 of them seemed set in their ways.
John Hughes looked into a very poignant and important part in the many stereotypical students of a stereotypical high school, from egos, pressures, pain, and exactly how all teenagers face the same things but in various forms. Social barriers are somewhat broken, by 5 people who would normally have nothing to do with each other, and their detention has a rather positive effect, but I kinda wished that the movie were longer to see what would happen to them when they saw each other on Monday in school. If only high school were really like this... the world would be a better place.",1056499200,,1293,4.908675799086758
58791,5,078322687X,"So, okay, the yuppie snobs called it ""The Little Chill"" when it was released. But ""Breakfast Club"" is about six times better than ""The Big Chill"" (which was a John Sayles ripoff anyway) because it gave us characters who mattered, characters who represented a type but transcended all traps of cliche and stereotype to become real live human beings.
Watch the film today, and listen to the beautifully realized dialogue. How did he know? How did John Hughes know that this was how we talked, this is what went on, these were the genuine problems we faced? John wasn't afraid of confronting cliches (the prom queen's divorced parents try to buy her love, the tough kid is abused by his alcoholic dad, etc.) because he knew that for millions of us, those cliches were real, and the fact that our problems weren't even original hurt us all the more. And he delivered all this in an enormously entertaining package, with genuine laughs and killer attitude.
I'm not sure the actors were ever as strong as they were in ""Breakfast Club."" Some of them floundered for years shortly after this was released. But man, did they ever figure these characters out to the BONE. Emilio Estevez' performance is more and more impressive with every viewing...his character has the least flash, but he might be the deepest, since he only barely understands how badly he's been hurt by his father's drive. But they ALL nailed their characters. It must have been incredible to be a part of this movie...watching it today brings back those memories like a flood.
Is ""Breakfast Club"" still relevant today? I don't know, but I sure hope so.",1056499200,,1613,4.764285714285714
58792,4,078322687X,"I saw BC twice before, but many years ago.  U have always wanted to own it.  Unprepared to wait for the 25 Anniversary DVD, I bought this barebones DVD release.  To be fair, this DVD was released in 1998 when the format was quite new.  I'll get to the DVD issues later.
BC is a fantastic film focussing on 5 teenagers who have to do detention on a Saturday at school. The character development is brilliant as is the acting.  The narrative is simple yet compelling.
DVD SUMMARY:
As mentioned above, this DVD came out in 1998.  It is a basic DVD with poor features (and some typing errors too). The movie is Widescreen 1:85 but not anamorphic - despite this, picture quality is ok.  The black bars are rather large though, if you have a 16:9 TV you may be able to minimise these.
The sound quality is the DVD's biggest let-down.  Mono city, and does it show!  Sounds so flat and can be hard to hear what characters are saying in some scenes.
But even with these letdowns, the DVD is worth owning for the film alone.  It is a film you will want to watch over and over.  I'll also be buying the 25th Anniversary DVD if it eventuates.",1053734400,,1130,4.283018867924528

Maybe that 5 students has to meet at 7:00 for a 9 hour dention. Then why didn't they call this The Dention Club instead of The Breakfast Club? As the movie opens, 5 students report to school for a dention. The staff member (Paul Gleason) in charge gives a 1,000 word essay on who the students think they are. They all have diffrent personality traits. There is a princess (Molly Ringwald), a brain (Anothony Michael Hall), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a criminal (Judd Nelson), and the weird one (Ally Sheedy). The criminal steals a screw and closes the doors of the dention room that angries the staff member who has to spend the time in school in his office next to the dention room, and instead of working on the eassy, they spend thier time talking expect for the weird one. This is a great movie to watch if you love teen movies, but this movie has a R rating for lanuage and I'm not sure if it rated R for anything else. This is also a must watch if you are a big fan of teen movies, or if you are a fan of one more more of the cast members. But this movie could have also been called the lunch club. But this more doesn't have a lot of characters, I say the movie has about 10 characters, and the 5 main characters are spending a Saturday in dentention. And there is a narrator's voice in this movie. I think ths movie should not have been called the Breakfast Club.

This is pretty accurate by todays standards except for the dated music and clothing, but the issues and the cliques are still the same. Actually the only cast members clothing that didn't go out of style is the nerds clothes. (Nerd never goes out of style) Anyway, John Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds the usual groups of high school students a jock, a metalhead a weirdo, a princess, and a nerd sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. But man it gets painful when they see themselves for they really are, and they see that none of them is better than the other.

This is one of the best films of the 80's, and, in this day and age, if there really MUST be anymore teen films, they need to give them over to John Hughes. He is one of the best.

There's just a ton of laughs in this from wise cracks to even some pretty good physical comedy and even a smoking pot scene that's really funny.
I took off a star because Molly Ringwald's character (Claire) is a bit on the annoying side but at least, Judd Nelson is harsh in this movie! And of course Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy weren't bad either.

It is the story of five kids, five very different kids and the day they were forced to spend together in Saturday detention.  We have Judd Nelson as the punk, or at that time, stoner boy; Molly Ringwald as the school princess; Emilio Estevez as the super jock; Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd; and Ally Sheedy as the no-name freak.

If there is a remote chance you haven't seen this movie via TNT, Blockbuster, or TBS, I highly recommend this flick. It is funny, sad, intriguing, and most of all, is the hallmark of every eighties teen film, surpassing even the likes of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and yes, even Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
You can't go wrong with The Breakfast Club. Be warned, though, there are plenty of vulgar words and sexual innuendos in this film but hey, that just comes with the territory.

The movie is set, for the most part, in the high school library where our protagonists are all held together on a Saturday detention.  Over the course of nine long hours of killing time, the brain, the jock, the princess, the troublemaker and the recluse all discover that, deep down, they really are not all that different from each other: they all want to be popular, athletic, smart, rebellious and also to be left alone.
The antoganist, they discover, is not each other, but the high school principal, and his myopic view that kids would all be little angels if they just wrote an essay on who they really are.
""The Breakfast Club"" is a treat for any age group from pre-teen to adult.  You will see yourself in this film, no matter when you went to high-school.  The language is coarse, the teen personalities are vulgar and the high school principal is the person we all hated but grew up to be anyway.
The DVD quality of this film is very good.  Although the film was shot in the early 80's and the library and furniture will look very dated, the dialogue and the angst the teens face is not bound in time.  The extras on the DVD are fairly good, and the sound quality is excellent.

We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice an entire Saturday in detention for what we did wrong, and what we did was wrong but we think you're crazy for making us write a essay telling you who we think we are.

Does that answer your question? Sincerly yours, The Breakfast club."" -One of the most remembered movie speeches ever.
My title should sum up my love of this movie. I saw it 2 years ago and have watched it at least 1 million times since then, i'm actually amazed my copy hasn't worn out. It stars the fabulous cast Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy, as Andrew ""The athlete"", Brian ""The Brain"", John Bender ""The criminal"", Claire""The Princess"", and Allison ""The basketcase"" respectively. The cast works fablously together and at times you feel you're right there with them. At first they can't go five minutes without arguing (especially Bender and Andrew) but by the end of the day they have laughed and cried and know each other in way no one else will ever know them.
My only dissapointment with the dvd (and the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars) is because I was a bit dissapointed with the special features part of the dvd, While the production notes were nice I am dissapointed there were no trailer or deleted scenes (I know there must be some since I have heard Judd Nelson say they shot over 4 hrs worth of film and since there are 2 scenes that are in the tv version of the film but not in the dvd or Vhs release) My BIG HOPE (John Hughes and Universal pictures are you listening?!) is that for the 20th anniversary which is approaching is that there will be a special edition dvd released and the film be rereleased in theateres (PLEASE NO REMAKE!!) I would LOVE a Sequel made but unfortunately I think the ""Brat pack"" label unfairly bestowed on the actors messed that up but hey we fans can dream right?",1023667200,10,2082,4.424479166666667
58818,5,078322687X,"This is quite possibly one of the finest movies ever made.  I felt every second of angst, every laugh, every tear of these characters.  John Hughes is not only known for writing gag movies like ""Weird Science"" and ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" but he's famous for his journeys into the teenage psyche.  He knows how teenagers talk (or at least how they talked in 1985) and the kinds of pressures they deal with.
John Bender (a brilliant Judd Nelson) is the badass.  His abusive past gives him a rough exterior but a fragile interior. Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the geek, dying to belong with the popular crowd but committed to being smart.  Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the prom queen every girl hated in high school, becomes aware of her own snobbery and learns how much she hurts others by being spoiled.  Emilio Estevez plays jock Andrew Clark who tries to please his old man by always being a winner.  Finally, Ally Sheedy does a wonderful job playing Allison Reynolds, a crazy outsider who just wants someone to pay attention to her.
The language is raw, the emotions are real, and the camaraderie between the characters is one of those bonds that is never forgotten.  They learn that they have some things in common, most obviously a hatred for the principal and the school system.  If you are an adult, watch this film to remember what being young was like.  If you are a teenager, you can relate to the demons each character has inside.  If you're a kid, you're not supposed to be watching this movie.  You'll only understand it when you rediscover it at age 15.  That's what happened to me.  I've seen this movie so many times and it still hits me every viewing.",1023494400,,1690,4.646464646464646
58819,5,078322687X,"The Breakfast Club is probably the archetypal movie of the 1980s, at least that of the youth in America.  It is an indelible part of cultural history and remains as fresh and brash as ever today.  While teenagers can certainly not be broken down into five distinct types, the five students forced to spend their Saturday at school in detention do a pretty good job of covering the basics.  You have Claire, the popular prom queen type, played by the wonderful Molly Ringwald, the jock (Emilio Estevez), the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), the weirdo (Alley Sheedy), and the disrespectful criminal (Judd Nelson)--five students who are complete strangers to each other and totally different personalities.  Terrorizing and threatening them is an older teacher intent on enforcing discipline among them.  The criminal is determined to foment an insurrection, and eventually the strict supervision of the students breaks down.  At first, the students yell at and fight with one another and are especially antagonistic toward the juvenile delinquent among them.  As the day progresses, the students begin to tell their own stories--who they are, why they are in detention, etc.  Their conversations weave back and forth between insults and incriminations and words of sympathy and concern.  They eventually start roaming the school halls, leading to the classic scenes of them skidding across the halls in a mad flight to return to the library before the teacher returns to check on them.  Somehow, the five eventually do open up to each other, confessing secrets, forming friendships, and realizing that the problems they considered their own are shared to some degree with each other.
This is a great movie and one that appealed directly to young people--everyone can understand problems with overbearing or neglectful parents, grades, peer pressure, drugs, etc.  I must say that I sometimes felt the changes between hateful exchanges and sympathetic dialogue came a little abruptly, though; I for one never saw any redeeming quality in Judd Nelson's character.  I also couldn't believe some of the destruction that was done to school property over the course of the day.  Anthony Michael Hall was brilliant in his role and provided some very funny moments, but I as a former brain did not see much of myself in him.  The real point of the film, though, is that teenagers all have problems they must deal with, that the folks not in your little group or clique are just as human as you are and worthy of respect, and that adults seemingly just cannot understand their kids for the most part, and that very fact only heightens the need for teenagers to depend on one another.
I should also mention the music.  ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds was perhaps the most-played song of the entire decade, and it is rightly associated forever with this movie.  Also, whenever you hear the famous whistling tune from this movie (and we've all heard it countless times since 1985, a fact which by itself demonstrates the much-deserved popularity of this movie over the years), you will not forget about The Breakfast Club.",1022889600,,3117,5.011627906976744

  Dear Mr. Vernon,
  We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are, you see us as you want to see us, im the simplest terms, or the most conveinient definition, but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and a athlete, and a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal.

The whole storyline teaches teens that everyone can be insecure and doubt themselves at times, and that you should never judge a book by its cover.  People who seem like they are ""hard-core"" or who seem to ""have it all"" have just as many personal struggles as the next guy (or girl).  It teaches acceptance and self-esteem lessons as well.  The language is pretty harsh, but realistic.  I would recommend a parent watching this movie with their teen and discussing it with them.

But it was The Breakfast Club that started it all off.
It's part of pop culture, influencing in many films and referenced in hundreds of others. If you only buy one movie this year, get a life. If you buy several, make sure this is one of them. It's a movie that needs to be in your collection.

58827,5,078322687X,"This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second ""teen coming of age"" installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are ""teetering"" with; staying with their social allegiances to their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any ""click"". I like the choice of actors; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) gets to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources.
The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.
The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.
The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.
The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the ""cooler"" groups. He also is a little ""cocky"" about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room.
The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!
Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the ""Villain"" of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, high testosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids. He helps them to strip away the blindfolds and to take a fresh look at every thing and everyone (including themselves).
This leads to the 3rd and final part of the movie. Where they cleanse themselves of all the pentad up anger and prejudices, where they experience a sort of rebirth. When the kids realize that they all have the same goal, they were just taking different roads to reach it. I also like the fact that Anthony Michael Hall's character, the nerd, has the last word and Judd Nelson's character, the criminal, gets the last scene. I think it was poignant that the 2 groups that are pushed the furthest down the social ladder get to close out the movie and punctuate the message that is being given' to a person that represents the source of their anguish. I highly recommend The Breakfast Club and it should go down as one of the all time great teenage movie!",1007510400,28,5123,4.509677419354839
58828,5,078322687X,"THE BREAKFAST CLUB is one of my all-time favorite films, though I've only seen it once. It takes place in the '80s when Saturday detentions were popular punishments in high schools. The film is about five very different high school students who all wind up in Saturday detention for different reasons. They at first hate each other, because they feel as though they've got nothing in common. There's the ""nerd"" (Anthony Michael Hall), the ""jock"" (Emilio Estevez), the ""princess"" (Molly Ringwald), the ""metalhead"" (Judd Nelson), and the ""weirdo"" (Ally Sheedy). But at the end, they pour out their hearts and souls to each other and what they really feel, and also learn how to have fun together even while in Saturday detention, which helps them to form what is known as the ""breakfast club"". The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. I am a high school student so I can really relate to the film - all of the teen agony the characters have in  the film. The storyline, plot, and script are truly amazing, and the directing is well done. Kundos to John Hughes for making a great, wonderous film! THE BREAKFAST CLUB goes on my list of top 10 all-time favorite films. And, if you enjoyed THE BREAKFAST CLUB, then I strongly recommend DEAD POETS SOCIETY, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, STAND BY ME, and THE KARATE KID films! This DVD is a must, even though not many special features were added onto it, which was kind of a disappointment, especially to those who love buying DVDs because of all the great extra special features the DVD has instead of the VHS.

A bunch of high schoolers have to serve detention together on a Saturday. Molly Ringwald is the Princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the geek, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Judd Nelson is the loner, and Ally Sheedy is the basket case. These different backgrounds and personalities come together and clash. They are pretty much forced to spend this time together and thoughts and feelings come out. Somebody dismisses it because it's a whinefest?. Get over it. This is life. It's one big whinefest!. The young actors(well, at the time)are all teriffic. They really bring these distinct individuals to life and make them believeable. I mean, really believeable. Paul Gleason is on hand as the principal who keeps an eye on the group. The ending might be a little too predictable and happy, but so what?. Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance here. He is really good. Hughes really writes teen life well. He does it a million times better than any writer writing the so called ""teen films"" of today. We need Mr. Hughes to come back and write teen movies like this for the new world we are living in.

58835,2,078322687X,"I found John Hughes 1985 movie The Breakfast Club to be an extremely generalized, heavy handed, piece of trite filmmaking that may or may not have been relevant to teenagers fifteen years ago, but is certainly nowhere near on target now.
 Obviously it was by design that his five main characters were one-dimensional character sketches of so-called traditional high school stereotypes.  You have Andy the jock (Emilio Estevez), Claire the princess (Molly Ringwald, a John Hughes staple), Bender the criminal (Judd Nelson), Brian the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison the basket case (Ally Sheedy).  In my opinion, for Hughes to insinuate that these five people come from completely different backgrounds and had absolutely no contact with each other or anyone else from their particular type during school is just plain silly.  For example, it is quite likely that Claire and Andy, being popular people, would know each other, or at least that princesses and jocks would interact on a regular basis.  Same thing goes for Bender and Allison as social outcasts.  Only Brian, being the brain, would logically be shunned by all other classes.
For another thing, these categories have little relevance today because in todays modern society, and indeed this has always been true, teens simply cannot be categorized and labeled, even by their peers, in this manner.  I myself saw elements of my personality in every one of the characters, and neither I nor anyone I know would fit neatly into these stereotypes.
 The last thing Im going to gripe about in this review is, logically enough, the ending.  For a film that tried so hard to be edgy, the denouement was awfully hackneyed and predictable.  Four out of the five characters hook up at the end?  Gosh, I never saw that coming!  Also, the treatment of Allison was laughable.  This girl has serious psychological issues that have been with her all her life, but all she needs is a little makeup, a nice dress, and a clean-cut boyfriend to set her to rights?  I don't think so, pal.  Willful suspension of disbelief is all fine and good, but to trivialize Allisons pain and emotional trauma in this manner is irresponsible and does a disservice to those young people who do identify with her character.  I think thats enough bashing for this film; while it had its moments, it certainly is by no means the classic that it is reputed to be.",1001980800,19,2393,4.871604938271605

There's some funny bits, some serious bits, a couple of sad bits, and a wonderful central set taking the shape of a huge library designed, not for keeping or reading books in, but to be a stage for this play to be performed in.

I think the best performance has to be Judd Nelson as Bender, the criminal, but the other actors give great performances as well.

The movie is about five different people who have to spend a Saturday in detention for different reasons.

This movie isn't the laugh out loud funny (i.e. ""Tommy Boy"", ""Billy Madison""), but it's still very funny. It does have a lot of swearing, for that is the only reason it's rated R.

This review is about the DVD. I will tell you up front that this DVD looks like a direct copy off VHS. I have seen the VHS version about 2 times this year and when the title song comes on, the audio fades in and out. Not bad, but you can definitely see some age in it. The DVD is EXACTLY the same. The sound is of no higher quality.
There is no widescreen, just a full screen with the same picture quality as VHS. It's not horrible, but if you are the type of person who buys DVDs for the superior picture quality, you are definitely going to be unhappy with this.
The movie itself is EXCELLENT, I love it, but the DVD transfer from VHS isn't the best.
As for bonus features, you get bios for all of the actors. The trouble is, the information included is the same as you can find on the internet movie database (imdb) as well as fan sites. If you have read a fair amount on any of the actors and know their biography fairly well, this DVD offers nothing new.
There are also some brief production notes about where and how this movie was done, and some quotes from the cast and crew.
Again, if you have done any research online and gone to any fan sites or even a site dedicated to John Hughes, you will find nothing new here. No interviews, a little behind the scenes, some background detail, but in the big picture, not much else.
Just a forewarning.
I bought the DVD because unlike VHS tapes, a DVD CD doesn't wear out. But if you watch the VHS version, then the DVD, the quality is the same. DVD is not any better.

We have clear cut stereotyped characters here who are driven by excellent dialogue. The group is so diverse when they first arrive at their Saturday detention, and in fact, their reasons for having to be in Saturday school are what bring them together. This group of youths who would never otherwise talk to one another is forced to be together for eight hours, and to bring them together a little quicker, we have a self-satisfied, diabolical school principal. We also have the social outcast ""criminal"" John Bender (played by Judd Nelson) who has marijuana to bring the group together. Each person has a different social standing and a different attitude toward life, but they discover that they have a lot in common, including insecurities and uncertainties about their identities and their lives. Even if their solidarity lasted for that one afternoon, they might have cause to think twice before stereotyping again.

The characters are true to the types of people you find at any American high school, and we've all adored/abhorred the prom queen, feared/embraced the criminal, etc.  That said, I will vent about the DVD edition.
Did Universal forget that this is one of the most popular films of the 80s?  Where are the goodies that seem to come standard with other films on DVD?  Where's the interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, edited scenes?  This movie is 15 years old and still being played all over cable channels day in and day out, and its popularity hasn't waned a bit!  I got my copy for Christmas and couldn't wait to get it into my DVD player, figuring the music would sound amazing and there would be plenty of extras.  WRONG!
The sound is weak; I can't understand why Universal didn't repackage this with stereo sound.  Because of the way this was shot, the movie retains a TV-look about it, but the images are clear and sharp.  You'll still enjoy the movie, but if you were drooling over the DVD for the possibility of bonuses, you'll be sorry.
I'm so disappointed with the DVD release...  I won't be surprised if, in 2005, a 20th anniversary edition happens along with all the fun stuff I'd hoped for.  (And yes, I'd buy it!)

58850,5,078322687X,"This is my favourite film ever. I can't quite say why as there are too many reasons. I thought Judd Nelson was particularly great as was Emilio Estevez. However that is not to detract from the other great performances by Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, John Kapelos and Paul Gleason. When I tell people that its about 5 students in detention they just look at me but its the journey we take with Alison, Andy, Bender, Brian and Claire that makes it so superb. If this teaches us anything its that people have problems no matter how blessed you think they are. I liked this whole era of films such as St Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink etc and while other viewers find it brings back memories of the 80's I am enjoying these films as a 90's viewer. If I had to summarise The Breakfast Club in three words it would be superb, brilliant and excellent. To anyone reading this who hasn't seen the film buy it now you won't regret it.
I also liked Vernon being analysed by Karl who tells him that he only took a teaching position cos he thought it would be easy. ""Then you found that it was actually work and that really bummed you out"" However my favourite line is too hard to choose as 10 or 11 spring to mind immediately.

58851,3,078322687X,"Ahh, this movie.  Oh, dear.
This film was released at a time when I was especially susceptible to it; I was 15 in 1985 and was smack in the middle of the target market.  I must have seen it at least half a dozen times since, and while my admiration for the craft of it has grown, my perception of what the film actually _does_ has sharpened and become more caustic.
In brief, Hughes starts with a superb premise and proceeds to systematically fudge it, rather than threaten the commercial appeal of the film.  Watching it now, it starts soooo promisingly, with John Bender (Judd Nelson, excellent) in full bulging-eyed effect as the potential Lord of Misrule in this teenage purgatory.  He is rude, obnoxious, and genuinely threatening as the quasi-berserk working-class loser.  Over the course of the story, the various denizens of detention learn to overcome the prejudices they have about each other, and leave the building as a supposedly coherent bunch of Human Beings.
This is the bit that I find implausible.  There were John Benders in my school, and they were this frightening, almost this intelligent, but no way were they this vulnerable.  (In case you haven't guessed already, I am represented here by the Anthony Michael Hall character - the studious nerd - except that I wasn't that studious and no way did I do so well academically.)  It was necessary for Hughes to flatter his largely teenage market by promoting a dream of solidarity - teens against the oldsters! - that simply didn't exist in the mid-Eighties.  Hughes does manage to capture the utter distrust and dislike of authority amongst these kids; they defend Bender from the unpleasant teacher, even though they don't like him, and that much is accurate.  (Trivia note: Paul Gleason, the classic 80s rentavillain, he did exactly the same hardass mo-fo schtick in Trading Places, is great as the teacher, who happens to be called Richard Vernon - I'm guessing, after the veteran UK actor Richard Vernon, who played the elderly square in the train compartment in the first reel of the first Beatles' movie ""A Hard Day's Night"".  Teen revolt intertextuality.  Somebody follow this up, please.)
This could have been a seriously radical (in every sense of the word) film if the other kids had turned on the Nelson character and torn him to shreds.  Instead, he gets the prom queen and even gets to stick her diamond earring in his lobe.  Of course, the film I dream of would never have been made.
Still, it was something of a pleasant shock, when you were 15, to find your most subversive sentiments being aired in a Hollywood movie, even if the film ignored, glossed over or otherwise fudged them in the wind-up.  So I still enjoy The Breakfast Club, even though I no longer believe it.  The thing I find depressing is that teenagers today seem to be even less rebellious...",971827200,5,2847,4.767820773930754

I finally figured it out,  The Breakfast Club and then spent 9 months tracking a copy down.

58855,5,078322687X,"I saw 'The Breakfast Club' in my sophomore English class because my teacher wanted us to watch this movie. 'The Breakfast Club' is about a group of high school students (during the '80s) who all end up at Saturday  detention, each for a different reason. The students at the beginning, of  course, absolutely HATE each other - they can't STAND each other! But then  they learn to appreciate each other as the day goes by. They start to  appreciate each other when they each tell why they were in Saturday  dentention, and become friends in the end.
I like how they have a cast of  completely different characters: a jock, a princess, a nerd, a weirdo, and  a metalhead. They actually seem like realistic characters - and some of the  stories they tell are heartwarming and devastating. All in all, good  acting; fantastic plot; and a great cast. There's also a really important  moral to be learned when watching this movie. If you listen very closely,  you'll be able to catch it. This is a great movie. You don't even have to  be in high school to enjoy it. I really recommend it!",963792000,,1082,4.549222797927461
58856,5,078322687X,"Did you know that ""social"" problems such as being ""picked"" on in school are one of the top reasons for teen suicide? Yes, it is true. Students commit suicide to escape the torture of being treated unfairly. The kid who  is viewed and labeled as a dork dream of being treated like the others. The  princess of the class flaunts her beautiful necklace of real precious  stones that her parents gave to her. Others look and wish they had here  wealth and looks. The bully is feared by many, as they tremble at the  though of being humiliated by him. Many, even weird by the dork, which even  in his case does not understand him/her, view the weirdo of the class as a  reject.
This is somewhat of what makes the suicide rate so large for the  American Student. Harmony among the ""labels"" is distant if not nothing more  than a dream for many. This film indirectly tackles this issue.
These  five students were scheduled for detention for eight hours. A dork, kook,  criminal, jock and a princess sat in their seats for these eight hours.  There sat five students, five labels, five minds, and five personalities.  Five students, five labels, five minds, five personalities that were  totally different and clashed horribly. At first the clashing showed the  dork getting picked on, the kook getting laughed at, the jock being  challenged, the princess getting lets say getting some inappropriate  remarks by the bully.
Their assignment was an essay on ""Who Am I?""  Through the course of the film they would come to know the answer of this  more than they ever dreamed. The clashing turned into harmony. The realized  this difference which once caused the ""clashing"" is what made their  friendship so strong. Amazingly they came to understand they were as  different as they were the same. They entered each other's world. They all  entered the bully world as he told of this horrid and dreadful home  situation. They even smoked his dope that they once viewed as something  they would never do. (This is a funny scene Brain in this scene will make  you rewind a few times it is so funny.) The bully entered the princes'  world as he wore the expensive diamond jewelry earring that once was the  center and target of his jokes.

ALthough the prospects look grim, the  kids manage to bond with one another despite their backgrounds.
Each of  the 5 actors display a deeper side of their characters, especially  Estevez's wrestling-jock who struggles with his father's expectations.  Although the ending seemed to be anti-climactic, it doesn't take anything  away from the strong last-half of the movie when the 5 characters find  common ground with each other.
