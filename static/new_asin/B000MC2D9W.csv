8167736,1,B000MC2D9W,"This woman needs to keep her knowledge in print.  Ten minutes of the most unbelieveably grating voice and the video had to be ejected. What I did pick up was her sales pitch about her belt leash to which you attach a dog on a walk.  Try THAT with a large, bouncing dog or even a small terrier who spots a squirrel!  You can give your review of this leash product to the EMS crew that pulls you out of the bushes to tend to your wounds.

Sarah's Dummie book is much better than anything she could do on video/dvd.  If her method rings your bell, get one of her books. And DON't buy that waist leash unless you don't mind being abruptly yanked off your feet by a dog of virtually any size. Good grief.",1318464000,,699,4.110294117647059
