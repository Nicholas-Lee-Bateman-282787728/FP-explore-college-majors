2494188,5,B000E5LEW4,"Being a 50 something, I did a report on Jimi Hendrix for my 8th grade English class. A Jimi Hendrix fan for life. What an awesome experience to see this show in 1967 Monterey! They put it in the context of history and show the other artists gathered. Really recommend this one to any Hendrix fan. Was also very interesting and entertaining  second dvd part about Otis Redding.",1388188800,,376,4.529411764705882
2494189,4,B000E5LEW4,"I picked up this Criterion Blu ray recently never having seen it before.  Well, I guess I did see the Complete Monterey Pop Festival which includes these performances.  This is about as good as I've seen Hendricks who was 24 at the time.  He was trying to best ""The Who"" and Pete Townshend's guitar smashing, so Jimi lights his guitar on fire...then smashes it... in front of some stunned (or just stoned) fans.  Musically he was hot.  ""Purple Haze"" and ""Foxy Lady"" were chart smashes and he sizzles here.  The concert runs 49 minutes which includes an opening ""art"" sequence as well as a couple earlier London appearances.

Otis Redding was 25 and was changing soul music by making it hipper and more relevant to the newer generation.  Same theme but with a more upbeat rhythm or else sultry and romantic.  He hits the target with this 19 minute set including ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" and the great ""Try a Little Tenderness.""  Redding and most of his band died in a plane crash 6 months after this concert.  Hendricks lived another 3 years.  The Blu ray disc shows the age of the original print.  It comes with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio and is shown in 1080p.  It is certainly watchable, especially the close ups but don't expect reference material.  The audio is very good with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option along with Dolby Digital 2.0.  There are optional audio commentaries and a couple interviews.",1356652800,3,1409,4.6437246963562755
2494190,5,B000E5LEW4,"Two of the greatest performers ever....We would lose them both a few short years later, but these performances live on Criterion blu-ray looking and especially sounding better that ever. The 5.1 sound is really incredible, you just have to hear it to believe it. The video is slightly grainy as to be expected, but no matter- with performances like these you can't fault this disc. I would recommend getting the Complete Monterey Pop Festival which has all this and more. Great stuff.",1325462400,,484,4.914634146341464
2494191,5,B000E5LEW4,"I wore out the record of this match up in the early seventies.
This year was the 40th anniversary of this version of Monterey Pop
Festival, and these two artists definately left a permanent impression
on the music scene of that day. Otis Redding was one of the most vibrant
and powerful singers ever; and this recording; along with back-up bandmates  Booker T & the MG's (feat. Donald ""Duck"" Dunn and Steve Cropper
of Blues Bros. fame) was one of the best live sets ever filmed.

 Jimi's performance was nothing short of spectacular as He wowed
the crowd with guitar work few had ever seen until this day-

 I heartily recommend this concert dvd.",1193356800,8,646,4.631578947368421
2494192,5,B000E5LEW4,"Why do you even need a review? This is Jimi Plays Monterey.
If you don't have this you are missing history caught on tape.
Hurry up and order!",1190592000,2,142,4.107142857142857
2494193,5,B000E5LEW4,"When Jimi Hendrix burst onto the rock scene in the UK he had the likes of Eric Clapton in utter dismay while he received adulation from Pete Townsend, The Rolling Stones & The Beatles, to mention but a few. The Who refused to play after him at Monterey, because he was, at any venue, an impossible act to follow. If you want to know why, you must buy 'Jimi plays Monterey' (you get Otis Redding's performance there as a bonus, as well as a brilliant, informative commentary that guides you through the movie). Since the late 60's Jimi has been my number one rock artist, and this is his number one performance. The disc has been remastered in every respect; both sound and visuals are utterly superb.",1184284800,5,700,4.519685039370079
2494194,5,B000E5LEW4,"I had this on video tape and watched it hundreds of times.  I recently transferred it to DVD and watched it another dozen times.  I waited to buy this because I couldn't find any reviews about the picture and sound quality.  I finally bought it and am glad I did.  They did a fantastic job on the transfer.  The picture is 1000% better than my old video tape or the DVD I made from it.  They say they removed thousands of dust marks from the picture.  The black background is actually black.  The colors are nice and bright.

The sound is great.  I don't have a 5.1 system yet, but I will soon.  This will probably be the first DVD I try in it.  It sounds so good on stereo, that I can't even imaging it sounding better.

Very impressive upgrade from previous versions.

The concert speaks for itself.  It is a classic.  This is my favorite Hendrix concert video by far.  The songs are great and the performance is mind-blowing.",1165449600,22,928,4.333333333333333
2494195,5,B000E5LEW4,"I have been a Jimi Hendrix fan since the mid 60's and have bought everything I could get my hands on by Jimi Hendrix.
I have had the VHS tape and the vinyl copy of Monterey.
The vinyl recording was very good as was the VHS tape. Finally its out on DVD.
There is nothing new here that has not been released before. Jimi Hendrix collectors like myself have to have it on DVD as well though. This of course is the performance that started it all. This concert is legandary to say the least. Jimi pulls out all of the stops. You will never find a better performance by Jimi Hendrix anywhere else.
What does set this apart is the Otis Redding performance. Otis does Shake along with I've been Loving you too long, Satisfaction and Try a little Tenderness.
There is also an interview by Pete Townshend as he recollects the festival and the legandary coin toss to see who performs first and who has to go on last. John Phillips gave his account and Townshend's acount is a little different. Townshend says the late Brian Jones actually tossed the coin. I guess we will never really know for sure who did.
This is a worthy addition to any collection........enjoy",1150588800,17,1154,4.44811320754717

8106132,5,B000E5LEW4,"Excellent version of the Jimi Hendrix experience. The Otis Redding ""Shake"" stage show was good but wish he had performed longer. However, that was consistent with his stage shows at the time. Too bad we lost him not long after the show.",1517443200,,236,4.642857142857143
8106133,1,B000E5LEW4,I thought Multiple format meant that it included a streaming version to play immediately on Prime.  Disappointed,1515456000,,112,5.588235294117647
8106134,5,B000E5LEW4,"Product arrived in great condition. I bought it 'new', so yeah.  Unfortunately, I have a boxed set, which includes these concerts, and I bought this not realizing I was buying something I already have. I gave this copy to a musician friend, and he absolutely loves it. Highly recommend if you're a fan of Jimi and/or Otis, or just a fan of classic rock in general.",1505520000,,364,4.515151515151516
8106135,5,B000E5LEW4,"This is without a doubt one of the very best concert films available on DVD or Blu-ray. 50 years later the performances by Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding remain two of the most incredible, iconic moments in music history. The filmmaking itself is incredible not to mention  the amazing sound quality --and nothing seems dated. Highly recommended!",1498521600,,345,5.052631578947368

8106138,1,B000E5LEW4,"I bought this Blu ray, and was excited to watch Hendrix legendary appearance. However, when I put it in my Blu Ray/DVD player a note came out saying that this Blu Ray can't be played cuz the Blu Ray system is unrecognizable!!! My DVD Blu Ray Sony is a high standard one and it should work on all system. I really can't understand why their should be ""different"" ""USA"" only types of sysyem. Cpme on, guys, the world is a global village now, and it is irrelevant to have different DVD/Blu Ray systems>
As for me, I'm just gonna go to my friends and find a DVD that can understand the different types!!!",1427155200,2,600,4.31858407079646
8106139,5,B000E5LEW4,"This was a magical time in the history of music - at least for us Boomers- especially for me, who grew up in Berkeley in the 60's, when the music scene was so damn good - that was thankfully captured on film. I had the vinyl back in the day, but it vanished somewhere along the line. So I started doing a search for a CD of this album, and was not able to find one - only vinyl and this DVD. So I opted for the DVD, as the visual is so much a part of the whole experience. I realised a few minutes into it that I have seen this before - on more than one occasion, on TV channels like PBS or VH1 Classics, once in a blue moon. So I jumped on it!!! And I will not ever regret it!!! The individual performances themselves are phenominal, when you stop to really think about it! I mean, this was Jimi Hendrix & The Experience's first ever U.S. appearance, after Jimi came back from his time in the U.K. And then there's Otis Redding, who was playing for the very first time to this type of audience - and he grabbed it and ran with it all the way past the goal post - and was greeted with open hearts! In my personal opinion, these are two of the best performances by some of the best musicians of our generation. Of course, we can't leave out ""Bob Dylan's grandmother"" and Noel Redding, not to mention Booker T. and the MG's backing up Otis Redding, along with the Mar-keys' solid horn section! And I, for one, am so grateful and thrilled to have these precious recordings in my possession once again.!!! PS  - the commentaries are fabulous, as well, because each song is looked at individually, with all the special stories that go along with each one. Then additional interviews shed even more light on a very special time in the history of music. I highly recommend this DVD!!!!! And the vinyl, as well. Thank you!!!",1408147200,2,1816,4.23342939481268
8106140,5,B000E5LEW4,"Jimi Hendrix live at the Monterrey looks great on blu-ray with extremely clear colors and the sound is great with no static or distractions.  This set by The Criterion Collection has two audio commentaries by music critic Peter Guralnick and a bonus booklet with an essay by music critic David Fricke.  This is the concert where Jimi lights his guitar on fire, and smashes it.",1401667200,,376,4.769230769230769
