2077993,5,B0002CX224,"I LOVE SEASON 5 OF SVU BUT WHY ARE WE SKIPPING SEASONS 2, 3, AND 4????? THERE WERE SOME GREAT EPISODES DURING THOSE SEASONS.  PLEASE RELEASE THOSE SEASONS ON DVD.  WHY SKIP ALL THE WAY TO THE FIFTH YEAR????? PLEASE GIVE US THOSE OTHER SEASONS ON DVD.  I AM A LAW AND ORDER FANATIC. I WATCH THIS SHOW NON STOP.",1097280000,19,309,4.116666666666666
2077994,5,B0002CX224,"At the beginning I was questioning Universal's strategy to release season 5 before seasons 2,3,and 4. They said it was to help promote season 6.  Plus I didn't really watch any episodes from season 5, the only one that I did watch fully was ""Painless"" on USA network.  I must say I was very pleased with what I bought.  I had never seen the episode ""Loss"" until I bought the DVD set.  That episode is probably the best SVU I have EVER seen.  After that episode I was sad to see Stephanie March go.  However to be honest with you, I think her character got replaced with another one just as good.  A lot of reviews that I've read say more bad things than good things about Diane Neal and her character.  I will admit in her first few episodes her character didn't make some good decisions and had a lack of self-confidence.  However towards the middle of the season and at the end I think that Diane Neal played her character very well.

The only thing that I don't like about this DVD set is the double sided discs, but that disadvantage is completely overlooked by everything else.

Here are my top five favorite shows on this DVD set:

1.  Loss

2.  Mean

3.  Escape

4.  Tragedy

5.  Ritual",1095984000,22,1193,4.331818181818182
2077995,4,B0002CX224,"I was very eager to get the new box set of the Fifth season.
I pre-ordered and was thrilled when it arrived.  I have been a fan of the show since day one.
When I opened the box I was surprised to see that the discs had no picture on them, blanks ..they looked like second hand DVDs that you buy at Rogers.
I was expecting a bit more creativity in the design..The first box set was so beautiful
what happened?
Of course this doesn't alter the quality of the show.",1095897600,11,462,4.076923076923077
2077996,5,B0002CX224,"This is a definite box set to have if you like the show. Like many, I am also wondering why they chose to release the fifth year ahead of the others. Don't get me wrong, the last season was amazing, but those who have really only followed the show starting in the 2003-2004 season and bought the first season box set are missing all the stuff that had happened, but again amazing box set! The only downfall to this is that rather then the 6 or 7 disc set, they have reduced it down to four double sided discs and the way that they are packaged you're bound to put fingerprints or scratches on the discs. The extra features on the fourth disc are really good as well. I am waiting for the other box sets to make their way out onto shelves. Superb show!",1095638400,18,751,4.186206896551724
2077997,3,B0002CX224,"Why oh why did they skip seasons 2, 3, & 4 and jump straight to season 5??? Season 5 is actually one of the weaker seasons of this show. Stephanie March's ADA Cabot was a really strong, compelling character, and this franchise really took a nose dive when Diane Neal came onboard to replace her in season 5. The clumsy, ineffective ADA Casey Novak character pales (literally and figuratively) in comparison to Cabot. I find myself cringing at DN's line deliveries on a regular basis.

The writing also became pretty sloppy in this season. Many of the episodes attempted to address six different ripped-from-the-headlines! issues all at once. Some of the storylines seemed so recycled that one week I thought I was watching a repeat, when I was actually watching a new episode. The continuity department also seemed asleep at the wheel since what little bit of character development we had gotten in earlier seasons was frequently thrown out the window during this season.

That said, true fans of the show will probably want to get this for the ""Loss"" episode alone. (High drama! Explosions! Lots of subtext!)

I had been waiting for the Season 2 DVDs for ages, and I really can express nothing but disappointment in this decision to fast forward to Season 5.",1094601600,11,1259,4.819444444444445
2077998,4,B0002CX224,"This past season when NBC had a failed show and cancelled it, it was easy to plug in an episode of one of the Law & Order franchise.  Special Victims Unit (as well as Criminal Intent) episodes were not only shown on NBC but repeated a week and a half or so later on USA Network.  Plus the amount of times repeats were shown to fill spaces left by cancelled shows and over the holidays.  That means each one of these episodes has seen network airing in prime timew, not just twice, but sometimes four and five times.

Does Universal really think I'm going to spend my money on a box set of DVDs showing episodes I HAVE SEEN SO MANY TIMES THAT RECENTLY?",1094083200,4,651,4.225806451612903
2077999,5,B0002CX224,"I'm so glad that Universal is skipping ahead to Season 5 on DVD. This was the best season so far. But don't worry. Universal will be releasing Seasons 2, 3 and 4. The most recent L&O seasons are coming first, though, because a few weeks after they hit stores, the next seasons will begin broadcasting on NBC.",1091664000,22,308,4.421052631578948
2078000,5,B0002CX224,"I really like this series, as I have all the Law & Order shows and spinoffs, but I'm curious as to why we are getting season 5 before season 2,3, and 4? Same goes for the others as well, Law & Order itself jumped for season 2 to 14, weird way to release them, don't you think?",1089849600,14,276,3.8596491228070176
2078001,5,B0002CX224,"Law and order SVU is the best action show. You expirence the drama like no other show. Christopher Meloni is Det. Elliot Stabler. The lead Det. on all the cases. He knows what he's talking about on the show. Mariska Hargitay is Det. Olivia Benson. She works side to side with Chris Meloni (Det. Elliot Stabler). Richard Belzer is Det. John Munch. He's outspoken and says what comes to mind. Ice-T is Det. Odafin ""Fin""Tutuola. He works as partners with John munch (Richard Blezer). Fin is the young Det. who transfered from narcotics.

This show is my favorite show on TV and has been for years. Packing was perfect and came in great condition. Shipping was great as well because I didn't have to wait that long. It's a shame Chris left the show but I was not happy how they exited the show. I feel it should have taken a couple of episodes to remove him from the show. Now Im not saying that Im happy hes gone cause believe me I want him back on the show right now. All Im saying is that I miss him on there and he should return as a regular cast member.  As for the rest of the cast members, they are growing on me day by day but what Im not happy with is how often they keep changing cast members so often. If feels like they are only on the show for only a few seasons and away they go but at least they exit them with a real story unlike Chriss character.",1468627200,,1056,3.866359447004608

The screen jumps, then freezes, then the DVD player starts to make an awful clicking sound and locks down completely. You have to unplug and re-plug the machine just to get the tray to eject so you can get the disc out.

2078059,5,B0002CX224,"And so we find ourselves at the fifth season of Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  And its a pretty good season, better than the past two and ranking up there near the top.  And if you're reading this review without having seen the first season, stop and go start at the beginning.  I don't care if you can watch these out of order, it's always good to watch things in order.

Law and Order: Special Victims Unit deals with the tough crimes.  Rape, child molestation, elder abuse, etc.  It's not for the light hearted.  But the detectives that investigate these crimes balance it out with compassion and a thirst for justice.  They want to put the bad guys away, and that's what makes this show worth watching.  If it wasn't for the talented actors, this would just be gratuitous violence, but the way they do it ensures that there is a story and lesson within the series.

There are twenty five episodes in this season.  And they are all actually quite good.  Not the kind you get up and walk away from anyway, as they keep your attention.  We're still not back to having the detectives home lives carry over episode to episode, so again, this season is pretty much a series of stand-alone episodes.  And that's ok, because they have enough of a plot in each episode that they don't feel unfinished.  There were a lot of thought provoking episodes in this season as well.  Episode four, ""Loss"" deals mainly with ADA Cabot getting herself into quite a mess with a dangerous perpetrator and it keeps you at the end of your seat wondering what's going to happen.  ""Choice"" asks the important question of what rights a mother has over her body when she is pregnant.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There are cases involving hate crimes, bullies, teacher student involvement and a whole lot of other hot topics.  But they are managed to be put in a fresh perspective rather than copied identically from the newspaper stories they are inspired from.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richard Belzer: John Munch
Stephanie March, Alexandra Cabot
Diane Neal: Casey Novak
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
B.D. Wong: George Huang
Dann Florek: Don Cragen

Once again I can find no complaint with Meloni or Hargitay's acting.  They always do a great job acting as a team and really seem like real life police detective partners.  They just have that kind of chemistry on the set.  Belzer and Ice-T again weren't in many of the episodes, but at least they were in more than they have been in the last few seasons.  I like the element they add and it shows that there's more than two people in the squad working on cases.  Neal as the new ADA I always take a long time to warm up to when I start re-watching the series.  Since she played a role as a female rapist in one of the previous seasons, it throws me when she comes back as a completely different character.  But eventually I get used to it and am able to appreciate the approach she uses to present the cases.  Although March will always be my favorite ADA.  I think that they did a great job casting the ""bad guys"" in this season two.  They all played parts that I wanted to see the people put away for good and the ones that had the mental problems or other issues were convincing.

This really isn't a child suitable show in the end though because of its subject matter.  It may not even be that adult friendly for those who don't like these harsh topics.  And that's perfectly fine.  I frequently question myself on why I like this show so much when it deals with perversion and aside from the train wreck argument, I really do have to say that I like watching the cast and the excellent job they do of portraying police detectives.  They inspire a want of justice and that can only be beneficial.  And then there's always the fact that different causes are brought to light by showing these types of cases on tv.  In all, its just a thought provoking series.

2078060,4,B0002CX224,I believe that this season had a lot more suspense than previous seasons. I was throughly suprise but i might add that certain stories looked like stuff ripped from real life celebrity stories somewhat disguised!,1343520000,,212,5.085714285714285
2078061,5,B0002CX224,"Love this tv show, what's not to like? I always find myself watching it on tv even the reruns, so I figured I should just start to buy all the seasons. I don't get into to many show, but this one has me pulled in for sure, can't miss it.",1335744000,,237,3.76
2078062,5,B0002CX224,with both the quality and how long it took for it took to get here. I would buy from them again for sure.,1309132800,,105,3.608695652173913
2078063,5,B0002CX224,ordered this for myself. I love the law and order series. The condition was in excellent condition. I would order from this seller again.,1294185600,,137,4.75
2078064,5,B0002CX224,"The Fifth season of Law and Order 2003-2004 is probably the most challenging, daring and brutal of all these series.

Hovered by a magnificent creativity by these screenwriters in what concerns the wide rank of themes and items. Nevertheless there are worthy to remark Hate, Shaken, Bound, Poison, Painless, Tragedy, Coerced, Brotherhood. Sick for example is starred by Marleen Martin and it deals with a thoughtful situation that will make you reflect about the decision of commit suicide when you are close of a terminal state.

This is indeed, the season in which the supporting Fiscal assistant - Stephanie March- is replaced, due a serious inconvenient with a ruthless Colombian gangster. She will have to be under the well known Program of witness protection.

I would not hesitate or even blink at the moment to recommend you this extraordinary edition.

To my mind, it's hard to think about any other protagonists. Christopher Meloni, Mariska Hargitay, Ice T, B. D. Wong. Diane Neal, Dann Florek and Richard Blezer proved by far to be a team hard to die.

Absolutely recommended.",1274054400,,1087,5.050279329608938

My mother sent to me, as a warning I think. I told her I don't go out after nine pm, but I think she's still determined to scare me. I chopped the season in half and watched it in two chunks. It hurts now. I feel like my brain has been poisoned. Who are these people? I had a nightmare, Chris Meloni in a tanktop, his Christ tattoo mysteriously upside down, trying to convince me I'd been raped. Nightmares from this show. I think my mother wanted to talk me out of ever moving to New York. I wouldn't anyway: no sense of direction. Nightmares.

2078067,5,B0002CX224,"This is a great series and has remained so. This is an offshoot of the original Law and Order series. This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase. If you enjoy crime dramas, especially crime dramas that help open debate and deal with taboo topics, then this is the show for you. I guarentee you will enjoy it.",1228867200,,907,4.496969696969697

I purchased this 'new' item directly from Amazon (not a third party seller) and was impressed the way the item was packaged: Amazon sent an air pack that prevented any item damage.

Unfortunately, a disc still managed to get dislodged.

I'd be fine with a scratch based on the understanding that it wasn't Amazon's fault (and also that minor scratches don't break a DVD) but I was extremely disappointed to find that the supposedly new DVD had fingerprints on it (not my fingerprints).

Instinctively, I blamed Amazon and sent them an email questioning their item description claiming ""NEW ITEM.""

They responded to the email AND sent a replacement set in less than a day.  I received the replacement 2 days later.

I now know that it wasn't Amazon, but the item's manufacturer that was to blame.

Even so, Amazon took full responsibility by replacing the questionable item.

Amazon even paid for the damaged item's return mail fee!

Do not ever question Amazon's customer service!!!  It's the best I've ever heard of.

The DVD set is great as well.  This show is great, it makes you think and allows you to guess the outcome.  I'm not to fond of the SVU subject matter but I'm totally sold by the casting.  All the actors/actresses are great and they compliment each other excellently.

2078093,5,B0002CX224,"First of all I just want to say: stop the Casey bashing! I seem to be alone in this but I actually prefer Casey to that of Alex Cabot because she starts off so awkward, annoying and unlikeable makes me like her. Sure, the first couple of episodes are a little offbeat but towards the end of the series (and the current ones) Casey Novak (and Diane Neal, when I think of it) has come into her own. As far as I'm concerned she more than steps into the shoes of Cabot.

Although, this hasn't been released in the UK yet (when?!) I've seen all the episodes and my favourites are (I forget the name) where Alex departs and the one that focuses on Fetal Alcholol Syndrome.

However, I always feel that the character of Munch is overlooked. In the first series, he's very witty and acerbic but the writers seemed to have ""ignored"" him in the later series which is a shame because he's one of the best characters (prolly my favourite along with Casey, and Fin coming a close second) It's to their credit that the writers have managed to keep the ""closeness"" between Olivia and Elliot. On the whole, the characters are very believable from the cynical Munch to the empathetic Olivia and Casey who just wants to change the world.

2078098,5,B0002CX224,"Of the few crime dramas I watch (""Cold Case"", the original ""CSI"", ""Without a Trace"", and ""Law & Order: SVU""), ""Law & Order:SVU"" is by far my personal favorite show. I watch this show religiously on both NBC and USA network. Out of the five seasons, I strongly believe that season five is the strongest season in the series because the storywriting has been so compelling. That is just my personal opinion. I was originally unhappy when Stephanie March left the series after the first 3 or 4 episodes in season five and was wary of Diane Neal as the new assistant D.A. Thank heavens I was proven wrong. Diane Neal has proved to be a worthy assistant D.A to me. Casey Novak is just as defiant and strong-willed as Alexandra Cabot was, especially when she butt heads with Detectives Stabler and Benson like in her first episode ""Serendipity"". Kinda funny how Diane made her first appearance on the show a couple of seasons back as a co-defendant, and now she is back as the new A.D.A. Sure the plot twists can be confusing but that makes watching this show so enjoyable to be. A lot of my favorite episodes comes from season five. One of my personal favorite episodes is ""Ritual"" where a young African boy is found murdered. His death appeared to be a ritual death but appearances can be deceiving. Ice-T really shines in this particular episode as 'Fin'. His involvement in the case really shines through and is definitely one of Ice-T's best performances. I really think Ice-T compliments Richard Belzer's snarky, conspiracy loving character. The dynamics between the detectives are certainly worth writing home about. Another really strong episode was the last episode with Stephanie March as Alexandra Cabot in ""Loss"" which involves a murdered undercover agent. I was moved by the ending and how Stephanie left the show. Although I predicted how her character would be written off, I still thought it was well written. I especially like the partnership of Detectives Stabler and Benson. Although I wonder why seasons 2, 3, and 4 weren't released prior to season 5, I still think that releasing season 5 was a great idea. It is my personal favorite season of the show, can't wait for season 4 now (which comes in second behind season 5).",1120176000,19,2237,4.753213367609255

2078104,4,B0002CX224,"Let me just start by saying that this is easily one of the best shows on TV. The acting is fantastic, and the story lines are great. Unfortuntely, this season saw the departure of Stephanie March's character, Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot. However, her departure created what's arguably the best episode of the series, ""Loss."" While it may be a little overdone, it's definitely an edge-of-your-seat episode.

ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal) is her replacement, and she doesn't quite fill Cabot's shoes. Her character is less interesting and a little more whiny and she is constantly crusading for different causes. Also, she's not nearly as good a lawyer. But she's not all horrible, and she gets the job done I suppose.

One complaint I've always had about the show is that Det. Stabler's character sometimes overshadows the other detectives, who are more entertaining. His ""bad cop"" routine and constant squinting get on my nerves after a while. Det. Munch (Richard Belzer) is horribly overlooked, and it's a shame because he is the funniest and most interesting of the four detectives. Also, even though she's one of the two main detectives, Det. Benson doesn't have enough of a role on the show. When she is leading an investigation, she often ends up making mistakes, even though she is much more level-headed than her partner, which isn't quite fair to her character.

I didn't quite mean to ramble so much, but these flaws seem to become magnified come season 5. Despite this, it has some of show's best episodes, including ""Loss,"" ""Lowdown,"" and ""Mean."" I can't wait until they release seasons 2-4.",1110672000,9,1617,4.981481481481482

I hadn't gotten into SVU or CI for a while, but then I started watching them instead of repeats of the original series, and now I'm totally hooked on SVU.  It's surpassed the original series, in my opinion, and every episode has me in a trance.  This is easily one of the best series on TV, and season 5, like the rest, is spectacular.

Christopher Meloni (Det. Stabler) gives nothing but brilliant performances in every episode.  Though I'm not as big a fan of Mariska Hargitay (Det. Benson), she is a fabulous actor and a great asset to the series.  Comedian Richard Belzer and rapper Ice-T also add something special to this awesome show.  Watching them all work together is a beautiful thing, and once you start, it's hard to stop.  Dick Wolf continues to deliver some of the best drama on TV today.

This is a great set to pick up.  I promise that once you start watching, you'll be hooked.  Season 1 is also available on DVD, and is just as good as season 5.

As far as the DVDs themselves, I was a little disappointed that they went the cheaper route and used 2 sided DVDs. In my experience, these get messed up a little easier due to the fact that there isn't a side that can take a little injury, and no matter how careful you are with your DVDs, you are going to encounter fingerprints and/or scratches.

There weren't many extras but I rarely watch those anyway. The ""police sketches"" of Ice-T, BD Wong, and Dann Florek were interesting, though. I was disappointed in the SVU alumni montage because I think it missed some good stars that have appeared.
