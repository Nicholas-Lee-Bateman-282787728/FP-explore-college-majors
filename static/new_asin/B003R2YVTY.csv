8403094,3,B003R2YVTY,This is basically a superhero cartoon where the heroes are a group of sumo wrestlers that can transform into even bigger sumo wrestlers. Its not epic but it's still pretty funny. Some of the best stuff is stuff that's off the radar. Worth checking out for a cheap price. 10 Episodes on this DVD.,1435622400,,295,4.481481481481482

8403096,3,B003R2YVTY,"This is a goofy, somewhat potty mouthed show about 3 sumo wrestlers, Mamoo, Booma and Kimo who fight crime. They are teen-agers and act as such. Seriously they mean well but they're not that bright. Imagine a team of Chris Farleys from Beverly Hills Ninja running around in big thongs fighting crime. They also have super powers for when they get into a tight squeeze. Mamoo uses ""Sumo Squeeze"", which  is a powerful squeeze of the enemy. Kimo attacks with ""Honourable Thunderball"", in which he spins towards the opponent like a bowling-ball. Finally, Booma attacks from above using ""Gluteus Maximus"", in which he uses said muscle to squash the opponent. It's kind of fun if you're a 4 or 5 year old kid, or if you think like one. You'll especially enjoy the gratuitous references to th...ahem...""bottom"".
