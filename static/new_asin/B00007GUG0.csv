There is hardly any ""snowing"" of the picture and the colours are as vivid as can be...""picture perfect"" means just that nowadays. However, 34 years ago colour TV was in it's infancy (do you remember when TV stations had the words ""In Colour"" on the captions before a programme?!!, perhaps I am getting old!). I am, honestly(!), too young to remember the Apollo era, and so was extremely pleased when this Dvd set was produced and made available. The trouble for all us ""space fans"" has always been that the only way to see this historic footage has been on spaceflight documentaries (which usually have footage and audio from different missions dubbed together or show only brief snippets). ""Raw"" footage is what we have always wanted, and here, finally, it is!
From the launch day TV coverage, to the TV transmissions on the way to and in orbit above the moon, the 1st moonwalk (which includes different angle views from the black and white TV downlink and the automatic 16mm colour film taken from the Lunar Module), to lunar liftoff, more TV transmissions and re-entry operations this Dvd set has it all (and all without a single narrative or spliced/dubbed sequence). There is also footage of the astronauts training, assembly operations of the launch vehicle and multi-angle views of the launch itself. All in all, a fantastic package.
The pictures aren't always clear and the colour isn't always ""true colour"", but THAT is the whole point. The footage is seen as it was sent back to Earth nearly 4 decades ago. Because of that, it has attained near magical qualities. If we went to the moon today (and let's hope we do soon!) the pictures the astronauts sent back would be clear and snow free! It wouldn't have the same impact that this footage has or had.
This is a historic record of mankind's first steps on another world and is well worth, in my opinion, buying. These and other titles are available, although Amazon.com only sells the Apollo 11 and 15 sets at the moment (and only from the USA site so PLEASE Amazon.com, sell them at the others!) but I would highly recommend them to you.
To put it in a nutshell.....The real life drama of this footage knocks any (and I mean any) science fiction or computer generated space type footage to it's knees. This is the real thing, as it happened and you just cannot simulate this!",1041292800,14,2434,4.675990675990676
8375102,5,B00007GUG0,"Being 4 years old at the time Apollo 11 landed on the moon I don't remember to much about it. Growing up I wanted to be an astronaut. Well that didn't happen but I'm still a big space buff. I had always wanted to watch all the Apollo 11 mission footage. Producer Mark Gray has wonderfully transferred for the ""armchair astronaut"" the original ""raw"" NASA Apollo 11 television transmissions, 16mm film & Hasselblad 70mm camera images onto a 3-disc DVD set. I have spent hours watching this. If you're into space & history you'll enjoy & treasure this DVD set very much. I highly recommend it.",1040342400,7,590,4.5754716981132075
