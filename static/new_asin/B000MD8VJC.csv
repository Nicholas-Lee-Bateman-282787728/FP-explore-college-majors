8174144,3,B000MD8VJC,"Its a biker movie - so don't expect Academy Award winning acting or writing.  And there really is a bit of a story.  William ""Big Bill"" Smith is ""Angel"" - a biker who sells out his brothers to a journalist to make some big bucks - and his ex-bros ain't happy!  Not as many choppers and outlaws as many of these flicks, but still not a bad movie.",1272326400,,345,4.044117647058823
