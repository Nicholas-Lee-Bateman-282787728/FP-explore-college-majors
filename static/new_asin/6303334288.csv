624653,5,6303334288,"Medium Cool is a film directed by Haskel Wexler who won an Academy Award for cinematography on the superb ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"". This film is a totally unique documentary style 1st class drama set during the actual 1968 Democratic Convention. As the film begins we see a car wreck and a cameraman who stops to film it, but doesn't help the victim. This is one central character. The other is an attractive West Virginian woman (Verna Bloom). Now into the film we hear RFKs final speech, and soon are in the midst of the now historic rioting in Chicago '68. The title came from Marshall McCluen's books. TV is the medium and cool its detachment from reality, but reality gets right in your face and those of the characters. This was THE confrontation the '60s had built up to and you had to choose sides: Peace and Love or Pigs and War. Needless to say, Wexler's vision was not shared by the masses (who elected Nixon).
 The McCluen based concept for the film is on an intellectual level many won't get, but what is easily accessible is the whole '60s feel in all the scenes, off the cuff newsmen discussions, a hippy psychodelic party, and '60s street scenes.
 In short all elements come together spontaneously to create an important, thought provoking, memorable vision of the '60s.",959990400,3,1294,4.671052631578948
624654,4,6303334288,"Interesting approach to revealing the world of photojournalism, news journalism, and political activism, conceived and directed by award -winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Fictional narrative features a  Chicago TV news crew intertwined with actual news footage in and around the  Democratic Convention of 1968.
There is a good balance between the  fiction and non-fiction elements in as much as Wexler attempts to make his  point. The fictional story line (a love story) is real enough to keep us  watching and deflective enough to make the harsh realities of the  non-fiction elements palatable.
Attention to detail defines Medium Cool  as a very personal film for Wexler. There definitely is a political  perspective. Second and third viewings will call attention to painstaking  perfectionism in construction of shots, timing, and pace--the subject  matter and cinematic approach (low budget, hand-held, docu-style) may  suggest a ""student film"" so don't be confused. This is an extremely  well-crafted highly professional product. Nice interjects of great  era-defining music compliment the visuals.

This all goes on at the same time the political stuff is happening and the director of the film had begun filming the actual convention and the demonstrations that were going on and, lo and behold, all this other real stuff started happening which conveniently went hand in hand with his plotlines.  Now either he developed the plotlines after the riots and police violence, etc. or his story was so well developed and timely that he was just able to fit it into place and blammo.

624700,5,6303334288,"Those familiar with Criterion DVDs and Blu-rays know about the company's commitment to quality, so this new edition of Haskell Wexler's ""Medium Cool"" won't disappoint.  The video is sourced from a new 4K master, so the detail and stability of Wexler's 16mm and 35mm footage is second to none.  The mono audio sounds great too, and give credit to Criterion for not attempted a faux remix.

The special features, by and large, are some of the best I've seen from Criterion.  Not only to we get an older 2001 audio commentary with Wexler and company, but the studio also commissioned a new commentary  with historian Paul Cronin.  Together, they provide a lot of context for those who don't know some of the real stories behind the scenes.  We also get a handful of documentary excerpts, including a brief reunion with the actor who plays young Harold in the film.  Together, these extras are almost as compelling as the main feature.

This is one of Criterion's very best releases of the year and probably the best since ""On the Waterfront"" a few months ago.  If you're at all interested in Wexler's film or the events surrounding it, this is a no-brainer.  For more details, please see the complete Blu-ray review I've written for this release at http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/60283/medium-cool/.",1370822400,8,1296,4.953703703703703
624701,5,6303334288,"Medium Cool has never looked better on this newly minted Criterion Collection Blu-Ray. The colors look vivid while the transfer still retains the texture of the original film stock.

There is an audio commentary by director Haskell Wexler, editor Paul Golding, and actor Marianna Hill. Wexler addresses the criticism of the opening scene and how the two journalists don't help the accident victim. He mentions being faced with that decision several times in his career. All three praise Harold Blankenship's performance and how real it is. Wexler and Golding point out that during the protest scene at the end, tear gas was really shot at them, but the famous line, ""Look out Haskell, it's real!"" was added later.

Also included is a commentary by historian Paul Cronin who examines the origins and production of Medium Cool. He expertly analyzes the film's themes while also delving into what led Wexler to make it. Cronin points out that Wexler paid for the film himself and then the studio paid to distribute it. He explains the fascinating backstory to the film's famous line in this great look at how Medium Cool came together.

There is a trailer.

There is an interview with Haskell Wexler where he talks about the origins of Medium Cool and how he was going to direct another film, but realized that something was going to happen in his hometown of Chicago and wrote the screenplay for the film. He discusses the influence of documentaries in this engaging interview.

Also included are excerpts from Paul Cronin's 4-hour documentary on Wexler entitled, Look Out Haskell, It's Real!, that focuses on the making of Medium Cool. Wexler, a few historians and key cast members take us through the production in this absorbing documentary.

There are also excerpts from a documentary about Harold Blankenship, who Eileen's son in the film. He grew up in a rough neighborhood in Chicago, but now lives in the wilds of West Virginia. He recalls being in Medium Cool in a kind of fragmented way and it is startling to see how much he's changed over the years.

Finally, there is ""Medium Cool Revisited,"" which sees Wexler return to the city for the 2012 NATO Summit. He ended up shooting a documentary about the Occupy movement and this 30-minute featurette takes a look at how he did it.",1369872000,9,2288,4.851282051282051

That should be enough to make one realize where cinema has gone in the last 44 years...  Instead of a piece of complete revisionist history,  la 1950s Technicolor classical composer biographies - ketchup scene included - (something that I hoped that we had grown out of as a world), here we have a piece of film that captures one of the more dynamic and turbulent eras of modern American history and is not afraid to interplay between fiction and reality in a innovative and avantgarde fashion...  Wow!  This movie is heavy and at times so real...  You feel the concern and the stress of the mother...  It reaches new heights in aesthetic achievement...  Much like Proust captures an era, this movie captures a moment that BECAME an era!  I can't wait to get my copy of it in Criterion as I'm sure that they'll do it justice!

624705,5,6303334288,"I have always wondered whether this film is great because of the concept and situation or as a film on its own.  It really doesn't cover the convention riots as such.  So, it is not a document of Chicago.  I wonder if folks consider this great before seeing it?",1272326400,,261,4.285714285714286
624706,3,6303334288,"Over 40 years after its initial release, Medium Cool still stands as that rarest of commodities: a truly original film. Director Haskell Wexler set out to create a film that introduced actors into ""real"" street scenes in order to create a new type of movie. The result is interesting, but only a partial success.

Medium Cool's basic plot concerns a TV cameraman in Chicago, John Cassellis (Robert Forster), who views his work with complete detachment.  As Medium Cool progresses, however, Cassellis finds that he cannot remain neutral. This is the basic tension in Medium Cool; Wexler suggests that no one can avoid involvement in a time of great upheaval.

Cassellis eventually becomes involved with Eileen, a single mother from Appalachia. Eileen, too, is drawn in to the events of the day. The ""love interest"" aspects of Medium Cool seem forced. Eileen allows Wexler to make some comments on gender discrimination in the USA, but Medium Cool's personal and political subplots never seem to gel. Moreover, both my wife's family and my family are from Appalachia; we agreed that Wexler's script draws Eileen in a way that reveals a shoddy knowledge of Appalachian culture.

Wexler believed that, given the riots in many of the USA's cities in 1967, his film would focus on the efforts of black Americans to gain equal rights. Once filming began in Chicago, however, his focus shifted to the violence surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention. This creates problems in the film; Wexler filmed several scenes with black actors in apparent anticipation a ""race riot."" Given that no riot actually occurred, these scenes are mere ""loose ends"" that are not tied to the rest of the movie.

The film serves as a backdrop against which Wexler can comment upon the culture wars of the 1960s. Wexler forces the viewer to examine his or her perceptions of violence, sexism, racism, and many other ills. Sometimes Wexler's views still seem insightful; at other times, they seem dated. Wexler also includes some unsubtle praise for Senator Robert F Kennedy (whose assassination is mentioned in the film).

Medium Cool is the cinematic equivalent of a musician's jam session; Wexler started down a road and wasn't quite certain where he would end up. I give the film an A for ambition but only a C for execution.  Still, it's worth a look.",1248566400,7,2336,4.9743589743589745
624717,5,6303334288,"Haskell Wexler's one-of-a-kind film seamlessly blends narrative and documentary forms, as the actors actually played their scenes as the Chicago riots were exploding all around them. Thus ""Medium Cool"" attains a heightened sense of tension, immediacy, and danger, as the line blurs between drama and reality. Evocative and extremely well-played by Forster and Bloom, this is a fascinating time-capsule for the ages. Look for Peter Boyle as an impassioned right-winger.",1182988800,3,468,5.7
624718,5,6303334288,"`Medium Cool' was directed, scripted, produced and filmed in 1968 by Haskell Wexler who had had success the previous year working as a cinematographer for Norman Jewison (In the Heat Of The Night, 1968) and Mike Nichols (`Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?', 1967). He would also later work with George Lucas, Hal Ashby, Milos Forman and Terence Mallick in the 70s shooting important films of  the `New Hollywood'.

Of all the films considered to be counterculture works this has to rank as one of the best mostly for the fact that it accurately captures the atmosphere of the period. I rank this up there with other films like `Punishment Park' (Watkins, 1970) and `Zabriskie Point' (Antonioni, 1970).

624719,4,6303334288,"This film is a must-have for anyone interested in the sociology, history, and physical development of Chicago.  Done in a neo-realist style using a mixture of professional and amateur actors, the story revolves around real scenes shot during the 1968 Democratic Convention and the ""police riot"" that ensued.  The deus-ex-machina ending is a bit disappointing, but the street scenes and footage are mind-blowing for students of Chicago and its history.",1168819200,,451,5.428571428571429
624720,5,6303334288,"Absorbing, thought provoking and, above all, a unique record of an important ""place & time"", why ""Medium Cool"" still fails to gain the attention it deserves remains one of life's great mysteries.

First off, it's a pretty good if somewhat disjointed story... two ""world-wise"" middle class news reporters are sent to film the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago and become unwittingly involved in its political demonstrations, the inner city problems that have precipitated them, and the lives of a single mother and her young son in this harsh, confusing and seriously under-privileged world. Its acting, in particular from Robert Forster as the lead reporter and the 13 year old Harold Blankenship as the son, is excellent and at times so effective that it's difficult to remember you're watching a rigidly sequenced film rather than a social documentary. And, it's overlaid with some quite stunning cinema-photography from director Haskell Wexler, one of America's very best exponents of the art, backed up by a perfectly pitched late 60's soundtrack.

Good enough so far, but that's just the start. Add-in its extensive live footage from the streets of Chicago as the riots develop, taken by the film's camera crew as they themselves are caught-up in a very ""real"" political drama, its ominous sequencing of the build up of events from a fun ""day in the park"" for the hippies/yippies to serious ""police state"" level violence, its equally chilling images of what was going on inside the Convention Hall while all of this was taking place, and the clever and disturbing scenes of the mother's desperate search for her lost son as Wexler films her within the increasingly anarchic crowds of demonstrators & troops actually on the streets at the time, and you've got... something very special.

Part film and part documentary, not all of what you think is ""real"" in ""Medium Cool"" is, and the lines between live and acted scenes are sometimes confusingly and frustratingly blurred, as in the famous call from one of the camera crew of ""look out Haskell this is real"" as a tear gas canister lands in front of them, which was in fact over-dubbed afterwards. But that's the whole point of the film as the final, almost startling scenes reveal. How far is the media in control? Is what you're seeing real, distorted or contrived?  Wexler's brilliance is to take this underlying theme and to mould it into a fascinating exploration of inner city life, American society in a period of huge change, and the power/needs of the media in a TV dominated world, while, in parallel, producing a gripping record of what it's like to be in the centre of a demonstration that's spiralling out of control. Juxtaposing the impersonality of reporting with the very personal situations that are involved, it raises a whole series of questions on the way without falling into the trap of most films of the era in trying to ram home too many answers. And, as a result, it remains as relevant today as it did then.

Quite rightly regarded as one of the best ""counter culture"" films of the late 60's and much richer and more thought provoking than this classification usually implies, it remains one of the most under-rated films out there.",1121731200,8,3216,4.915285451197054
624721,5,6303334288,"I saw ""Medium Cool"" shortly after I had been drafted in 1969 - in San Antonio where I was going through basic training for conscientious objectors.  I was so blown away by this film I sat through it a second time (you could do that in those days) to try to take it all in.  The mixture of documentary style direction with actors playing characters was a new idea, but to put them into an explosive (& eventually exploding) situation was a stroke of cinematic genius by Wexler.  The movie also received an ""X"" rating for a scene you could probably show during family viewing hours on TV these days.

The thing that still stands out in my mind after all these years is Robert Forster's characterization of the news cameraman.  Working in this ""cool"" medium, he stays detached from the people he films almost to the point of inhumanity.  In the opening scene, Forster and sound man Peter Bonerz come upon a crash on an expressway, the car against a wall with its horn blowing continuously and a bleeding woman lying on the ground next to the open passenger's door.  They procede to start filming the scene, but Bonerz compains that the horn is wiping out all other sound he might get.  Forster goes to the open (from the crash) hood of the car & yanks out the horn wires.  They then continue filming the scene without ever considering calling for help for the injured woman on the ground until they're finished.  You begin to wonder who are these guys who callously put getting the story, which they would have gotten anyway, ahead of helping someone who's been injured.

Two other scenes come to mind which give insight into Forster's character.  In one scene with girlfriend Marianna Hill, she challenges him by asking him about a scene from the movie ""Mondo Cane"".  This scene involved tortoises on a Pacific island whose sense of direction had been affected by atomic bomb tests to the point where they no longer knew how to find the ocean.  She asks Forster if, after they were done filming, the cameramen might have turned the tortoises around and pointed them toward the ocean.  She really wants to know what he would have done.  Forster replies, ""How do I know?  Those were French cameramen.""

The second scene occurs when Forster is watching the mourning for the death of Martin Luther King on TV at Verna Bloom's house.  His reaction to the outpouring of grief & emotion on the screen is to say, ""Jesus, I love to shoot film.""

Forster (& the others I've mentioned) are great in this film.  And among the other points he makes with this film, Wexler reminds us that to the TV camera, our lives, joys, accomplishments and especially our sufferings are reduced to being just frames of film which may occasionally be newsworthy.",1102550400,7,2732,4.626556016597511
624722,3,6303334288,"I first time I became aware of this movie was when I read Roger Ebert named it one of the ten best films of 1969, though the film was not available on vhs or dvd.
 ""Medium Cool"" is a werid hybrid. It has moments that work and other that don't seem as polished. This may be due to the improvised atmosphere the film creates.
 When ""Medium Cool"" works it captures the feeling and the spirit of the 60s. It belongs in a class of movies such as ""Blow-Up"" , ""Weekend"", & ""Z"". Even if you were not born in those times, and I wasn't, the film manages to lets us know what it was like back then.
 The opening moments of the film are my favorite. It has a documentary feeling. It seems intense, and maybe because I'm a journalist major I enjoyed the scene where the journalist talk about the choices they make in what they show on TV.
 But ultimately ""Medium Cool"" is a political movie that has a political and social message. We hear characters speak about the Kennedy assassination, the war, and Dr. Martin Luther King. And while these issues are 40 years old many of the arguments being presented in the film can be argued today. For instance there is a scene with protesters and one shouts out ""We have a war we do not want!""
 All of this is bein told while the 1968 Democratic Nation Convention is about to come to Chicago. And it works, but the movie at this point loses its focus. Now we have a love story emerging between John (Robert Forster) the star of the movie and Eileen (Verna Bloom). Their story sometimes drags the movie down. Eileen doesn't really do anything for the movie. Maybe if she were part of the protest against the war she would have fit in better or even if she was for the war that could create a another conflict the film could have used. But no this never happens.
 The movie also was improvised and this hurts it also. The dialogue is terrible. I've yet to see a movie that has improvised dialogue that I enjoyed. It sounds like very bad 40s ""B"" picture talk. The kind of dialogue that you laugh at even though you know it's suppose to be taken seriously.
 The movie was directed by Haskell Wexler, he also gets writing credit, producer and cinematography credit. And most people probably know him just as a cinematography. He filmmed ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", and ""The Thomas Crown Affair (68 version)"". Even though I didn't find the directing to be impressive he did receive a Directors Guild nomination for this film.
 While the movie does have its problems, bad dialogue, werid hybrid story-line and an ending I personally found unsatisfying, even though I guess you could say the movie ends the way it begins. It is still a movie I'm glad I saw. And I hope many others see it for a first or second viewing. *** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: Entertaining if sometimes disappointing look at life in the 60s. Still works in today's world as many of the problems are still being fought. Worthwhile overall.",1089331200,3,2976,4.455882352941177
624723,5,6303334288,"Hollywood just didn't get it in the Sixties and the best they could do was turn out stuff like ""Wild in the Streets.""  But there were two films that did capture what was going on in those days and 'Medium Cool' was one of them.  The other was 'Easy Rider,' and both of them were made in spite of Hollywood and not with the help of Hollywood. One picture dealt with the political upheaval in the streets and the other dealt with the cultural revolution.
I saw 'Medium Cool' the week it opened and I probably wasn't the only one who considered it a revolution in film making and figured it would be the first of many such films that tied documentary and narrative film together, but sadly there were no more 'Medium Cool's' to follow, or no more 'Easy Rider's' either.
The Amazon review is totally uninformed in describing what happened in Chicago.  The only 'riot' that happened were the police riots that repeatedly attacked the protesters and anyone else who happened to be in their way.  And very few of us considered ourselves to be hippies by that time.  I know because I was there and that's me on the cover of the DVD carrying a red flag.  Interestingly Haskell -- who I became friends with many years later -- is still at it.  I was marching down Hollywood Boulevard in an antiwar protest at the beginning of the Iraq war and looked up just in time to see Haskell in the crowd pointing his DVD camera at me.  There was no tear gas this time, no rioting cops, and no machine guns set up on the streets.  I wasn't carrying a red flag and my hair has long since turned to gray, but some some basic things never change.
This picture tells it like it was as only the world's greatest cinematographer could have done it.  Amazon calls it a 'curiosity' and maybe it is, but it's also an authentic historical document executed with artistry and passion and is every bit as watchable as it was back then.  I recommend it especially for this wonderful and brave new generation who are carrying on the great American tradition of dissent in these troubled times.",1085961600,56,2058,4.446808510638298
624724,5,6303334288,"Medium Cool is an icon and artifact of the political furnace that was the 1960's in America. The title derived from the then-popular analysis of mass media by Marshall McLuhan, it mixes the important events of the time with the lives of characters trying to live their lives and do their jobs in the midst of upheaval with an insight into electronic media.
 Originally this film was supposed to be another film entirely. Instead, two-time Oscar winner Haskell Wexler and his crew, after the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, waded into the turmoil of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.
 There is some resulting confusion apparent in the film. Is it about the mass media, particularly television, in 20th century America and the insensitivity to human suffering it weaves? Is it about racial politics and cultural exploitation of black people? Is it about a poor Appalachian mother and child in Chicago? Is it about political intrigue, assassination and FBI spying and disruption of legitimate protest?
 At times some of the acting may seem stiff or ad hoc, and sometimes the sound has a raw documentary quality about it. But some of the music apparently enhanced on DVD, particularly that provided by Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention, provides a sarcastic critique of the popular culture promoted by the mainstream hype of the time. The conventional belief system was being severely challenged by assassination, the shocking realities of Chicago '68 and countercultural events like ""Medium Cool"".
 Patience of the viewer is rewarded with Wexler's outstanding photography in an amazing cinema verit of the characters playing out their roles in the actual ""police riot"" in the streets of Chicago.""This is REAL, Haskell,"" we hear one of his crew warn off- camera as tear gas is discharged in front of them. There is also some footage of the poor people's march and encampment in Washington D.C., with the TV crew squishing around in the mud in rubber boots as if on some expedition.
 The DVD is excellent. The technical perfection and poetic composition of Wexler's cinematography comes through from a flawless print. The commentary available with Wexler, actress Mariana Hill and Paul Golding interviewed in 2001 greatly enriches the viewer's understanding of the making of the film and its subtle touches.",1016236800,12,2336,5.136842105263158
624725,5,6303334288,"Released in 1969 by overshadowed by Easy Rider (which despite being a bit more flashy in technique is actually a far more conventional film), Medium Cool is one of the few ""counterculture"" films of the '60s to actually remain relavent.  The first film to be directed by famed cameraman Haskell Wexler, Medium Cool is the story of 1968, a panoramic view of a near revolution.  Cleverly, Wexler tells his story through two outsiders -- a detached newsman (Robert Forster) and the country widow that he romances (well played by Verna Bloom who should have become a star as a result of her sweetly realistic and appealing performance).  Though the film is clearly on the side of the counterculture, the use of these two outsiders allows Medium Cool to retain an objectivity that seems to be missing from most other films of the period.  Instead of simply worshipping the trends of the time, Wexler was actually at the apocalyptic events seen in the film.  When Forster and Bloom find themselves lost in the chaotic rioting of that year's Democratic convention, the scenes are riveting because they were actually filmed during the actual riots.  This is the rare protest film where, instead of seeing wealthy Hollywoodites playing their idealized versions of the times, you are actually seeing the events as they unfold.  For someone like myself who was born on the tail end of the Viet Nam War, seeing that footage and realizing how close to collapse society actually was in 1968 is truly an eye opening experience.
Much of the film, of course, is improvised.  Improv is often a frightening word when it comes to film making.  It seems to be a talent that a lot more people believe they have than actually do.  However, Medium Cool is one of the few films I've ever seen where the improvised sequences come off not as self-indulgent but actually very revealing.  It helps that Wexler found some of the best improvisational actors working at that time and put them in his film.  Hence, the wonderful Peter Bonerz shows up as Forster's jittery partner and the contrast between his nervousness and Forster's coldness provides for a good deal of humor (something missing from far too many protest films).  A particurlar highlight is when Forster and Bonerz interview a group of Black militants.  Bonerz's desperate attempts to both find an escape and come across as a good, white liberal at the same time are priceless.  Other than his later role as the oily dentist on the Bob Newhart Show, Bonerz was never given another oppurtunity to show off just how truly talented he is and that's a shame.
Also giving a strong improvisational performance is Peter Boyle, making one of his first film appearances and playing one of the first of his signature ""right-wing nut"" roles with a blue collar accent that never condascends or gives into easy elitism (another quality that sets Medium Cool apart from other protest films).
However, the film truly belongs to the two leads and they bring a true humanity to what otherwise could have been an overly cold and clinical film.  As stated before, Bloom plays a simple character without ever giving a simple performance.  Her political innocence is never ridiculed or attacked and her horror at the growing violence around her is wonderfully conveyed and felt by the audience.  Forster, an always underrated actor, gives one of his typically low-key performances and bravely gives an honest performance as a character that many in the audience probably won't find extremely likeable.  As he would later in ""Jackie Brown,"" Forster manages to convey his character's detachment while stll suggesting an actual, human being.  As he romances Bloom and becomes attached to her young son (well-played by Harold Blankenship), Forster slowly starts to surrender his cool exterior and Forster's subtle emotional development is wonderfully conveyed.  By the time of the film's apocalyptic ending, we've come to truly care about these two characters and, as a result, Medium Cool becomes more than just a film about the 1960s.  It becomes a film for the ages.",1008547200,77,4078,4.939970717423133
624726,5,6303334288,"""Medium Cool"" is one of those magnificent wonders that creeps up on the film world, either in passing conversation or in revivals. But it still has yet to receive it's pure due, in spite of it being made over 30 years ago.
It's an accidental masterpiece. Director Haskell Wexler's original intentions were to (via filmic terms) view the various sides of the media as relating to Marshall McLuhan's famous ""hot medium/cool medium"" essay. In this case, he corraled a bunch of actors (some of whom were associated with the Chicago improvisational scene), gave a loose story line and filmed it around the unfolding events at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention (with a few accidental stops in Los Angeles & Washington). Wexler attempted to put the actors into the roles of television men & everyday people and, basically, leave them with their own improvisational devices. Tus, this is where ""Medium Cool"" develops.
Maybe upon first viewing it in 1969, the performances didn't hold up, but more than thrity years later, everyone involved (even right down to the smallest part) has to be commended. This film is more than an experiment, or even a time capsule, but a true countercultural event. This is a film that not only teaches a thing or two about the times (1968), but also serves as a great study on media and it's truths & manipulations. It's also a great acting lesson of what improvisational acting truly should be...risk-taking with a high degree of failure (and NOT the cutesy-poo clever laugh inducing theatre that it's been reduced to...more later). You want a true example of play actors facing a REAL reality situation? Well, look no further...
Robert Forster's role may seem a little wooden at first, but as the movie (and years) pass on, he did an extraordinary effort of a man who's caught between compassion for his job, the manipulation that seems so tempting and the overall wear & tear that comes with the territory. Peter Bonerz puts an an excellent improvisational performance, years before ""Bob Newhart"" and fresh out of Chicago improv. One scene, with the two reporters in Washington after Robert Kennedy's assassination (in a taxi) speaks pages.
But two performances really stand out: Verna Bloom & Harold Blankenship.
Verna Bloom has the least obvious role as a lower-class single mother who, with very open and impressionable eyes, takes in everything around her via Forster's world. In what seems like an innocent (and touching) supporting role turns into one of the most ballsy & daring improvisational performances ever attempted, with the mother (looking for her son) stumbles upon a growing riot in a park. Only, the riot is very much real life. Masterful performance.
Harold Blakneship as the son provides what is the most pure performance by a child actor. He doesn't mug nor try to act cute, but there's something in his soul that looks like it lived many lifetimes. It's a soulful & haunting performance that doesn't seem to be self-conscious of the camera.
Despite Paramount allowing him to film it with a very strict budget, this is truly an independent film. Risks were taken. Lives were most definitely at stake. Comments had to be made. But it's one of the finest cinematic risks ever taken and a true multi-purpose film.
This DVD not only carries a fine widescreen transfer, but contains great commentary from Wexler, Paul Golding & Marianna Hill, plus a cool theatrical trailer (with the original 'X' certificate at the end for historical purposes). Fan of this film will not be disappointed.
In late 1999, I was in a class with a Chicago-based improvisational company (which shal remain nameless). When I mentioned this film in conversation, the teacher (who was also the manager of the L.A. branch) asked what we were talking about, I told him ""Medium Cool"". When he had never heard of it, I was shocked and told him that any improvisational actor, from Chicago or otherwise, should make this a mandatory film for studying any kind of on-the-spot acting. I lent it to him, but when I asked for his impressions, he just found it ""interesting"".
I guess he wanted to make people laugh.",1007769600,29,4128,4.915472779369628
