6929678,1,B00REK1ZJO,Shania is outstanding but the camera work is not up to her previous dvd productions. I bout both the dvd and blue-ray. The blu-ray is very bad  the auto is completely out of synch.,1429660800,2,180,4.294117647058823
6929679,5,B00REK1ZJO,Been holding out for the Blu Ray. What a joy it was to see this show and now have it to watch whenever I please...,1429056000,,114,3.6
6929680,3,B00REK1ZJO,"Excellent video and audio BUT Shania's performance is totally bland. The band members are much more enthusiastic than Shania is. She looks bored and has really aged since the Live in Chicago concert. Don't get me wrong, she can still sing but she looked like she'd rather be somewhere else. It is a well a produced Las Vegas production. But, Las Vegas is where the has beens go to retire and hide behind the Las Vegas show production.",1428969600,,434,4.576923076923077
6929681,5,B00REK1ZJO,"This August (2015) Canadian Entertainer (her words) Shania Twain (born Eilleen Regina Edwards) will be eligible to become an AARP member, but youd never know it based on this 92 minute concert filmed at the Las Vegas Coliseum in December 2012, and recently aired on broadcast TV. And, this was her first tour in 10 years. She first appears on stage in what might be best described as a form-fitting leopard patterned jump suit and the opening number Im Gonna Getcha Good  - with her voice run through an Auto-tune machine and a a crew of young male dancers  made me think I was watching one of Madonnas or Chers concert tours. It actually looked like she was lip-synching to the song. But from that point on  when she performed 18 of her hits (plus a short a capella cover version of The Hollies Carrie Anne  she seemed more like the top new country performer she was in the late 1990s. Yes, this is Vegas so there is a huge stage and there are lots of high tech video projections on the background (which usually accompany the four instrumental Interludes as she changes costumes. And she gets to ride two different horses on stage, as well as mounting a big motorcycle hung above the audience. But she does take time, periodically, to talk with the audience.

This concert (and DVD) is truly aimed at the ST fan and they will love it. The high-def images and sound are great. Youll see a lot of audience members trying to record the performance with their cell phones though they could have waited for this home video which has great camera work.

For Twain fans who saw the show on broadcast TV, there is still a reason to get the BD because of the bonus material. The Backstage Pass is a 61-minute video diary of the journey back to the live stage for Twain. It was filmed (actually video-recorded) by her husband and was culled from over 200 hours of footage. This is probably just fluff for the casual country music fan but Twains core audience will eat this up! It is on both the BD (which I viewed) and  on the DVD version as well.

The package includes n 8-page color booklet with photos and production credits.

The product is being released to coincide with Twains Rock This Country tour kicking off on June 5, 2015 with 47 shows in the US and Canada ending on August 23rd, just five days before her golden birthday. Like Madonna and Cher, both of who can fill huge spaces like the Coliseum, Twain knows how to put on a big high-tech show.

 By the way, there is a ""subtitles"" option in 4 languages including English so you can sing along with Shania too!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6929682,5,B00REK1ZJO,"I have to admit this was one of the best concert experiences I've ever seen. And I came across it by accident. I normally hate Las Vegas, but I was forced to go there when my brother had a conference at Caesar's Palace. But that's when I noticed Shania Twain was doing this show there. She is my favorite country music artist, and I saw her live on her last tour 11 years ago. I managed to get tickets and was blown away. This stage show has incredible sets, visuals and costumes in addition to Shania's great music. The show is a full lineup of her hits through her career along with a new single she wrote that was great. I have to say this was one of the best times I've ever had at a concert. If you're a Shania Twain fan, and didn't get a chance to see it live in Vegas, don't miss your opportunity to see it on Blu-ray or DVD.",1421712000,20,832,4.048484848484849

6929710,1,B00REK1ZJO,"This is another Eagle Rock disc victimized by the ""loudness wars"" (very heavy-handed dynamic compression).  The first thing noticeable is that this disc is very loud...in fact everything is nearly the same level.  None of the dynamics or low bass impact you would experience at a live show...plus the top-end sounds harsh.

If you are looking for pristine lossless Blu-Ray audio to feed your high-end system, look elsewhere.  Probably okay for soundbars and HTIB systems.

I will not knowingly buy another disc employing the same Mastering Engineer.  Very disappointed.",1459382400,5,569,5.337078651685394

After 10 years, her personal life took a toll on her voice.  The beat is slower too.  Its OK to reminisce and BR is the only way to go.  Wish some of the older concerts would have been released in BR format.

6929751,3,B00REK1ZJO,"Overall, I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great concert. However, since most of the songs are the same as those of the Chicago 2003 concert, which was brilliantly staged and performed by her, this time around I find her voice lacking in strength and her whole acting a bit too withdrawn and timid (she does acknowledge during this concert feeling uncomfortable on stage). One of the problems, I think, that causes her to feel less comfortable, less herself, is that much of her natural spontaneity has been taken away and sacrificed to the scripted and manicured enhancements that were added to her show. Actually, most of the dancers and back up singers and players seem to have been outperforming Shania during the whole show. Very disappointing I found her singing of my most favorite song 'Rock this Country' . Sitting around a campfire, surrounded by hand picked people from the audience, she could not deliver properly or enunciate with proper vigor and nuanced pitch the lyrics of that wonderful song. Hopefully, after her forthcoming, amazingly entitled, 'Rock this Country'  tour, she will regain the magnetism and charisma that were so much on display during her unforgettable 2003 Chicago concert..",1432771200,7,1224,5.029556650246305

6929756,5,B00REK1ZJO,"After more than a decade of being away from the stage, this Vegas-styled performance does not disappoint. All the glamour and glitz of Vegas is seen in Shania's performance as she graces the stage with her show-stopping outfits and the great utilization of her dancers who also stand in as violinists. Even for those who are not a fan of Shania this performance will sure to change your mind. She entertains with her powerful voice and her sincere stage presence. The only thing about her performance I would comment on is that it is a little on the ""nasally"" side, but other than that a great performance from her grand entrance on a motorcycle suspended in mid air to her glitzy Vegas ending.",1431648000,,694,4.650406504065041

Fromt the very first moment this show starts you'll be amazed by the sheer beauty of Ms. Twain riding a beautiful horse on the video screen. A HUGE video HD screen The horse morphs into a motorccyle and the rest is breath taking. and the Blu-Ray o comes with a ""Backstage"" video that entails Shania being invited to Vegas to begin the process of putting the  stage show together. And this women did a great job with every detail and aspect of the stage production. Well thought out and executed. Honestly it's the best stage show Ive seen live or on Blu-Ray. I'm a very visual person. And this show Wow'ed me It actually puts others to shame..Now I'm really kicking myself for going to Vegas and seeing it in person. The sound quality is excellent.
