4295201,4,B0049TC8DK,"Despite the impressions you might glean from the trailer or the cover art, this is an exceptional anime with wonderful animation, great characters and characterization, an appropriate soundtrack, and a good, suspenseful story with a very effective pacing that gives it an extraordinary vitality. Mind you, I'm only on episode six, but I can tell that this series will only disappoint by being too short.",1304640000,9,403,5.2153846153846155
4295202,5,B0049TC8DK,"Originally passed Rideback up when it was airing. Then some people convinced me to check it out. They were right. This is a great show. Its a mix of mecha with motorcycle racing, and then dancing...sounds odd but it mixes well. There is a fair deal of action as well as some great characters and story. Plus Mell does the opening theme song. If you've seen Black Lagoon you've heard her before. She did the opening theme to that anime too. This time she does a bit of a racing beat which works real well. Great stuff.

Right now the only downside I'm seeing to this release is the price. This is not a full 24-26 episode anime. Rideback is only 12 episodes. Plus if you like dubs, currently it is listed as being Japanese only. For $65, its a bit steep. This series should be in the $30-$40 price range. Hopefully they'll lower it before release. But even then, you can't really do wrong picking up this series, it is one of those rare gems in anime and its unfortunate that it only ran for 12 episodes.",1294704000,19,1003,4.335106382978723

4295238,5,B0049TC8DK,"I watched this on Netflix, and it was so good I finally bought it, too!
Sci-fi/action/romance/with enough rebellion against an overbearing government to make one heck of a story! Disbelief is not an option as in some other anime. It's not so ridiculous as to expect that anyone needs to suspend that.
The characters are real. If you like this stuff, get it. Don't wait!",1404691200,,369,4.6923076923076925
4295239,3,B0049TC8DK,The packaging and dilivery was good but the story was a little complex and hard to follow at time. I didn't remember that this also contained the blu- ray dvds which is usally more than the just the dvds.,1371600000,,204,4.256410256410256
4295240,4,B0049TC8DK,"Ballet and mecha. . .alot of emotionally detached characters, but otherwise an enjoyable anime.  Crotch rockets with arms. . .So the main character (ballerina) quits ballet due to an injury and becomes involved in motorcycles. . .a comparison of riding and touching the sky to freedom fits together in an obscure way.  The backstory is not really far-fetched, but political/military conspiracy to destabilize the government for its world domination agenda.  There are some CGI clips that are pretty awesome.  The closing is descent, however, it seemed too short of a series.  The gaps in time are left to the viewers imagination for character buildup and adds to the storyline progression.  On a personal note, Yamaha R1 engines should have been installed for top performance.",1361491200,,776,5.217741935483871
4295241,5,B0049TC8DK,"Surprisingly great, short but sweet anime. The theme of a injured ballet dancer who rediscovers art within her symbiosis with a Rideback vehicle Fuego. The backdrop of a society ruled by an oppressive government and Rin's inadvertent entablement with an anti-government group leads to drama and excitement.",1361404800,,306,5.531914893617022
4295242,2,B0049TC8DK,I enjoyed this Anime until I got to the middle to the end. It was disappointing. I like the concept of how the girl who is a ballet dancer finds her step with the rideback. I hatted how the group got involved in some terrorist plot.,1357430400,,232,4.065217391304348
4295263,5,B0049TC8DK,"I read the reviews and liked what I read but I wondered about the end. As I watched the series, I noted that the series seemed to be heading toward a head on crash at the end. You know, where everyone either gets killed or damaged beyond repair in the end. Well, I must say, after taking you thru what looks to be a huge disaster turns out so well, that I really was very impressed with it. I very much suggest buying this series if you like happy endings where not everybody gets tore up before the end. I really good series to watch even if it's short.",1337644800,10,554,4.091743119266055
4295264,4,B0049TC8DK,"I personally love this anime.  Good plot, story, and character development.  Animation quality is good too.  No complaints about the series, except maybe being too short.  If you can get this series for a decent price (currently $44 for this product as of this review) I'd recommend picking it up.  Especially Blu-Ray.  I would give this product 5 stars normally except for reason stated below.

My complaint is box design.

The box is designed like large boxes that hold trilogies or TV seasons such as Star Wars or *insert your favorite TV box series here*.  It's big enough for 2 DVD cases.  The problem is, it's a waste of material / space for what is included after the product is opened.  It comes with two items inside.  A normal sized plastic DVD case.  This has case has 6 discs inside.  2 for DVD and 4 for blu-ray.  The second case is the same size but is made out extremely thin flimsy cardboard insert that contains the key chain.  What do you normally do with a flimsy piece of cardboard that you don't need?  Recycle it or throw it out of course.

So now you have a nice large box to contain two DVD cases, that now only contains one.  A waste of space and material.  I like the box so I kept key chain case and stuck it back in there so they fit.  But after sitting on my shelf of over DVD's of anime it gets squished warped.  For now it's fine, but one day it's going to be chucked due to wear and tear and so will the nice large hard cardboard case with nice art on it.",1330300800,2,1487,4.235714285714286

4295266,4,B0049TC8DK,"I bought this anime on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The story line is good, well written and keeps your interest. I wish it had been a bit longer so the story line and character development could have been fleshed out a bit more.",1319328000,,237,4.288888888888889
4295267,5,B0049TC8DK,"I got the complete collection on blu-ray yesterday - released in Australia by the intrepid people at Madman [...]

I've watched disc one. Great story, fabulous animation, vivid colours and the whole thing looks gorgeous. Nice use of the music ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" by Modest Mussorgsky. The piano playing is lovely, too.

We meet Rin, a young ballerina who sustains an injury during a performance. She gives up ballet for her studies. The one rainy day she takes shelter in a garage and meets a Rideback club - a group of people dedicated to riding these strange contraptions which as a cross between a mecha and a motorcycle. Rin, by chance, becomes on of them....

In the background an insidious organisation, the GGP, is attempting to force its world government onto the citizens of Japan. A rideback group called the BMA opposes the GGP with civil disobedience and Rin crosses their path.

The story is rich and engaging, with lots of thrills and spills. I found the entire series a compelling experience on both an emotional and intellectual level. Another very fine achievement from Madhouse.

Along with ""Spice and Wolf"", ""Eden of the East"" and ""Summer Wars"", one of the better anims I've seen on blu-ray this year. If you're an anim fan, do not hesitate.",1318896000,,1268,4.824884792626728
4295268,3,B0049TC8DK,"As a big mecha fan I was expecting much from Rideback, but I was pretty disappointed.  The biggest issue I had with the show is that the story didn't have anything to do with the main characters.  If Rin never got on that Rideback, pretty much nothing would have changed.  The actual plot was almost completely unconnected with her.  As a result the show doesn't spend that much effort on the plot.  This would be okay if the show had something else to focus on.  It did try at that.  It wants to be a show about friendship.  It fails pretty hard at that though.  Instead of showing how the relationships of these friendships grow by actions, it just throws in some sappy scenes now and then where the characters just tell each other how they feel.  The second half of the series had me doing a lot of face-palms during these scenes.  They were that sappy.  The show is also much too long for what it is.  There is about six episodes worth of content here, but its spread out over twelve.

Another big problem with the show is the action.  There is fighting going on, but they don't really bother to show the viewer.  The show will get to a fight scene, then switch to a different character.  When they come back the battle, its already over.  It wasn't such an issue in the first half of the series.  There were some action scenes there.  They were short, but they were complete.  I guess the show must not have done well enough, and got a budget cut in the second half or something.  That's just speculation on my part though.

The animation was competent.  It wasn't what I was expecting from Madhouse though.  It was rarely awkward, but it just didn't have the physics and the realism that some other Madhouse anime has.  Budget probably has something to do with this.

I watched it with the dub, because that's what I do.  This one was alright, but the acting didn't really stand out or anything.  The dialog was decent.  There were times where it got quite poetic, and that was pretty cool.  The sappy parts were still sappy though.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed.  This is a mecha show, that doesn't really have any mecha action in it.  This isn't really a show that can stand on its own though, so without the action its not left with much substance.  Im still going to hang on to my copy.  The show certainly doesn't suck.  Its not bad at all.  Its just very average.  Im sure I would have liked this one more when I first got into anime, but I've just seen to many series that do everything this show does, but much better.",1314662400,7,2538,4.364806866952789
4295269,4,B0049TC8DK,"Judge Roman Martel, DVD Verdict-- The heart of the story is Rin, and the conflict within her. She's just a decent girl who gets pulled into a whole mess. It puts her friends, family and herself in constant danger. And yet, she loves the thrill of driving the Rideback. There are moments when she achieves a unity with the machine, and during these scenes composer Takafumi Wada uses the Mussorsky piece ""The Great Gate of Kiev"" mirroring the moment Rin achieves in the first episode. This little tune pops up in numerous forms tying Rin's love of dancing with her love of the Ridebacks. It works exceedingly well and is darn catchy to boot.

By the end of the series things continue getting more dangerous for Rin, no matter how hard she tries to defuse the situations she finds herself in. Once we hit an incident involving her brother, I honestly had no idea where Rideback was going to end up. Tragedy seems to be looming in every corner and Rin's internal conflict shows no sign of resolving.

But luckily, this anime series does provide a solid ending with some great closure. It's a refreshing change of pace to have such a good ending in an anime series, and for that reason alone I can easily recommend it.

Beyond that, there is plenty to enjoy. The animation by studio Madhouse is up to their high standards. The character design is atypical but works great with the more realistic story line. The characters are well rounded. The action scenes are thrilling. There are some humorous parts (especially in the first quarter), but the drama is what drives the story and it's here where the story excels. Up to the task are the English voice actors who do a great job with their roles, especially Tia Ballard who plays Rin.

Funimation presents Rideback with an excellent transfer. Dark scenes looked sharp, and the colors popped during the daytime sequences. The 5.1 sound added a bit of power behind the race and combat scenes. There are two commentary tracks with the English voice actors, both for key episodes in the series. You also get the typical clean opening and ending credits.

Rideback does an excellent balancing act that anime often dares but rarely achieves. It mixes genres to create a unique storytelling experience and reaffirms why I love anime as a medium. Simply put, Rideback is one of the best anime series I've seen this year.

4295270,3,B0049TC8DK,"Rideback is misleading from the very first trailer that I saw, or maybe FUNimation knows how to market to its consumers; but whatever the case-the series is not very good. The opening 9 episodes are slow, dull, and listless and tiresome on the eyes. The animation quality is mediocre at best, especially for a 2011 Blue Ray. The plot only picks up and starts to move at around episode 9 and then floors itself into episode 11 and 12 the best episodes. This is a story of a girl who falls of a horse and needs a help getting back on, that's the jist of the story. The horse would be her ballet and the help would be the rideback; fair, easy, not convoluted at ll. Yet the people she meets on her way are shallow and under developed, which makes you not care for them when the anime tries to have an emotional connection. The series was a letdown for me, and I wish it would have been released as an OVA summarizing the first 9 episodes than starting from episode 10.",1313539200,4,965,4.278688524590164
4295271,4,B0049TC8DK,"I bought Mell's Rideback single last year and so naturaly I checked into the anime. I can't say I was impressed. However, I got it recently--the price was right so I figured what the hey? I was glued to the TV from the first episode. It is only twelve episodes, so the character development is condensed but still good. Additionally, the story line is a bit weak--but I've probably just seen toooooo much anime. Like many of the other reviews allude: don't judge a book by it's cover. Sure, a ballerina on a motorcycle--sounds off, but this show was just so on.",1311379200,,561,4.509803921568627
4295272,5,B0049TC8DK,"I really thought this was a wonderful anime.  There should definitely be more reviews!  It really is a gem.  The animation, story, and character development are superb.  I personally love short anime series (Past 21 episodes I think is to much to tell a great story.  After than you end up being to ""wordy"" and wasteful filler episodes)  At the same time I wish this was 21 episodes at least.  Maybe that is for the best though because the twelve episodes tell what they need to.  It's just when you see great character development, you hate to leave those characters.  I wish we could have seen more action with the Ridebacks, but that's mainly because I think they are pretty cool.  But this series isn't about the action really.  It's about the characters and their story to tell.

It's good also to watch an anime that doesn't have constant pantie shots and all that tacky garbage.  There's plenty of opportunity they could have done long, slow motion pantie shots, but this anime actually takes itself seriously and doesn't pull of those lame cliches and degradation of women.  Pantie shots are so over done in anime it's just beyond...plain immaturity of the industry.  But enough about that!

The anime starts off happy at the beginning, but once you reach the 2nd disc, prepare for some sadness.

Buy it!",1310169600,5,1312,4.709251101321586

8419393,5,B0049TC8DK,"I wasn't sure what to expect with Rideback. I started watching it and it quickly grabbed me and I immediately cared about the main character. This is an excellent anime series, even more so because it doesn't follow the normal plots of most of them. Everything is more subtle and to me that makes it much more enjoyable. I don't want to give any spoilers but I view this as a drama anime with a few bits of action thrown in. Rideback puts the relationship between a rider and a machine in a completely different light than I've ever seen before and I think I can understand a little better now why vehicles mean so much to some people. This is one series I will be watching again!",1511308800,,680,4.3203125
