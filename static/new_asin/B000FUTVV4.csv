2590377,5,B000FUTVV4,I loved this movie... Charisma Carpenter did a wonderful job.... She was cute and funny and you couldn't help but to feel for her.... I can't wait to her and Holly Marie Combs to do more movies together... This is a perfect movie to watch with the gals...,1173830400,6,255,4.333333333333333
2590378,1,B000FUTVV4,"This unfunny sexual romp is badly written.  I love Charisma Carpenter, but she and the other actors in this film seem to be struggling through it.  It's not fun to watch; it's sad, dismal, and distasteful.  Don't waste your money and don't make the mistake of thinking it's a family film.",1170633600,10,288,4.607843137254902
2590379,3,B000FUTVV4,"Having read the novel, I decided it was time to see the film.  However I must admit that I was never a fan of Charisma Carpenter, but I really enjoyed her in this film.

See Jane Date is about finding the one....but having to date all the losers to get to Mr Right.

Jane's cousin is getting married to a high flying internet exec, and having a fancy expensive wedding.  Jane feels she can't turn up alone, so starts going on a series of dates to find her ""date"" for the wedding.

The book maybe more detailed, but the film is pretty much right on.  However I am suprised that they cast Holly Marie Combs in the role of Natasha Nutley....but she's very good in the role and has a very nice wardrobe.

I would recommend this film for anyone who has needs a laugh or has gone through the hell of dating..haha",1168300800,24,806,4.228758169934641
2590380,2,B000FUTVV4,"Drivel.  I'm a 40 year old woman and I like ""chick flicks"" when they are good. I loved ""You've got mail"".  But this? This was just drivel. Badly written, formulaic boring plot, and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends.

You want to watch funny interactions between the sexes, watch Friends or BBC's coupling.

You want to watch Charisma ACT? Go rent Buffy and Angel. Watch Veronica Mars.

Charisma did her best to be Mary TYler Moore, but in the end, she was an unbelievable character who I'm supposed to believe as a wallflower. Yeah. Right.",1162771200,,597,4.871287128712871
2590381,5,B000FUTVV4,"Charisma Carpenter is such a talented actress and beautiful woman.  This movie, seen many times on ABC Family and now on DVD is so well put together and highlights Charisma's acting ability.  She should do more movies like this.  I do my best to view all movies that I know she is in.  She is more talented then many so called actresses on screen today she puts them to shame.  The movie is just a pleasure to watch.",1161129600,32,416,4.282051282051282

2590421,1,B000FUTVV4,"I did not like this movie for a number of reasons.  1.  I felt it was crude.  2.  The main character sleeps with a guy she's just met, and no it is more than implied.  3.  It was rated incorrectly; the rating should have been PG-13 instead of PG.  4.  The movie was made in 2006 on the advent of cordless phones and cell phones, which dates it.  5.  The filming was distorted and stretched on my big screen LED TV.  5.  The values in this movie are very different than mine and were therefore offensive to me.  6  The younger cousin badgers and puts down her older cousin about her spinsterhood continually, which was offensive to me as well.  7.  There are a few good actors/actresses in the movie; but unfortunately, they appear to be dumb because of the script.  I would not recommend this movie, because I did not like it.  It is definitely not a movie for teens, because of implied and stated messages which were offensive and embarrassing.  I threw the movie in the trash can.",1413676800,,982,4.355555555555555

2590436,5,B000FUTVV4,"I saw this movie a few years ago and was excited that I could own it on DVD. Ever been constantly set up with blind dates and being told the clock's ticking and the only wedding you go to belong to your friends, This movie is for you.",1401321600,,234,3.8958333333333335
2590437,4,B000FUTVV4,"Even though she can't find the right guy yet, she seems to have an upbeat, good attitude.  She tries to go on and enjoy life without a man and has good friends who care about her.  And she has a good career that she's good at.  You can relate to her feeling down and lonely at times, and at the end when she does find ""Mr. Right"" you're so happy for her!  And he seems like a great guy.  This is a cute movie and Charisma Carpenter was good in it.  It would be a good movie for mothers to watch with their teenage daughter(s)!",1399507200,,526,3.961904761904762

2590442,5,B000FUTVV4,I was channel surfing when I stumbled across this movie on the satellite guide so I decided to DVR it and watch it. I'm glad I did because it turned out to be a delightful movie.

2590447,5,B000FUTVV4,I almost didn't like it.  I didn't like the spoiled bride or her mother but thanks to Charisma Carpenter I really loved this movie.  I loved the happy ending because she deserved a good man she deserved to be happy.  love it.,1377388800,,225,4.309523809523809

2590449,5,B000FUTVV4,"I saw this movie on Lifetime and loved it.  The story revolves around Jane, whose cousin is getting married and she finds herself without a date to this very lavish affair.  It touches on all aspects of her life - including her career and social life. This was a very entertaining movie and the acting was superb!  Even soap star  Linda Dano is the ever-present Aunt.  I highly recommend!",1366156800,,388,4.565217391304348

2590453,4,B000FUTVV4,"This film was great. I love Charisma Carpenter and think she shone in this. I also like Holly Marie Combs, so this was a great buy for me. The storyline is a little cheesy and predictable but that adds to it's charm. I am glad I bought it and glad I own it, it makes for a great movie night as it's easy watching. I would say 'definitely watch this one.'",1354579200,2,354,4.0

2590456,5,B000FUTVV4,"I first saw this made-for-tv movie when it came out on ABC Family and it quickly became a favorite. Charisma Carpenter is talented and fun in this quirky, cute, and not quite uncoventional love story. I would definetly recommend it to chick flick and romantic comedy junkies like me.",1285804800,2,283,4.795918367346939
2590457,3,B000FUTVV4,I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Charisma Carpenter. However the picture quality was not good and I wasn't sufficiently involved in the drama. This DVD is no more than an inoffensive distraction for a quiet sunday afternoon.......,1234051200,3,237,4.804878048780488

2590461,4,B000FUTVV4,"I admit I bought this item only because I am a Buffy addict and will buy just about anything featuring that cast.  Charisma Carpenter is probably my least favorite of Buffy's original cast, but, as I watched See Jane Date, I was drawn in to her performance.  some moments were predictably cheesy, but over all this was a great movie, perfect for a girls night in.  Also, fans of Charmed will love Holly Marie Combs in this very un-Piper like role.",1196121600,8,447,4.493827160493828
8126870,4,B000FUTVV4,"Considering it's a chick flick made in the early part of the 21st century, I'd say it was pretty good.  There was even a comment in there about Harvey Weinstein. Not a movie to watch again and again though.",1514851200,,206,4.282051282051282
