3043085,5,B000ZOT8MM,"This DVD is an excellent quality one by the BBC. Beatrix Potter stories on the video are beautifully done. We had another one in this series and our 2 year old grandson loved it so much I investigated buying another if available. A friend told me there were others so I ordered this one. He adores it too and I never get tired of watching it with him!! The live action scenes are gorgeous, animation wonderful and narration perfection. We love these DVD's!!!",1365033600,,458,4.530120481927711

3043087,5,B000ZOT8MM,"I remember these when they were a series and my children were small. Really adorable videos, calm and sweet, done in the same visual and artistic style as Potter's books. Charming!",1356480000,,180,4.838709677419355
3043088,5,B000ZOT8MM,"""The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle..."" is part of The Beatrix Potter Collection (there are three DVDs in the set) and I'd advise anyone who is contemplating buying this to consider buying the entire set (which I did). All three DVDs contain the entire series of animated features based on the stories of Beatrix Potter and produced by the BBC. The animation is faithful to Ms. Potter's illustrations and everything about this production is of superior quality.

Each episode is introduced by a beautiful score and a little segment featuring an actress portraying Ms. Potter going about her daily life, whether it be painting on top of a hill overlooking the scenic Lake District, posting mail, or back at home with her real-life bunny, Peter, sitting by the fireplace and sketching out something for a friend or relative (Ms. Potter was after all a great correspondent).

This DVD features three episodes:

The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Mr. Jeremy Fisher
The Tale of Mr. Tod: The Further Adventures of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny
The Tale of Two Bad Mice and Johnny Town-Mouse

The episode runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",1336003200,13,1206,4.897058823529412
3043089,5,B000ZOT8MM,"The books are always the best, but when you are needing to tidy up, what a good way to entertain your little child! Gentle, slow moving, always interesting, and with pretty music. If you love Beatrix Potter books you will love this for your child. And Hugh Lauries voice in there too!",1213142400,12,284,4.480769230769231

8236178,5,B000ZOT8MM,"Very Lovely And Ineffably Beautiful ! This Is Quite Tranquil And Relaxing. At The Beginning Of Each Episode, Beatrix Potter Is Painting In And Near Hilltop Farm, And A Shower Makes Her Gather Up Her Things And Proceed Homewards, Calling Her Shetland Sheep Dog. Entering The Gate She Tells Jemimah To Move Out Of Her Way. Going Inside, Peter Rabbit Reminds Her Of Some Stories To Finish Up To The Children. ( No Doubt Her Last Tutor's Eight Children. Her Last Tutor Was Only Three Years Older Than Potter. ) She Begins To Infuse Tea And Dip Her Pen Into A Nice Inkwell, Then Comes The Episodes. . . Each One Brings Potter's Stories To Life. So Splendidly Done ! At The Ending Of Each Episode, Potter Finishes The Story, And Proceeds To Post It Herself Or Handing It To One Of The Children. A Beautiful Song, 'Perfect Day', Also Helps Conclude Each Beautiful Episode. These Are Outstanding In Every Particular ! I Love Beatrix Potter's Works, And Watching These Helps Me To Slow Down And Appreciate Life And Nature More. To Pick Up My Calligraphy Pen And Dip It Into Ink Again. To Infuse Loose Leaf Tea And Step Away From Connectivity To Appreciate: '. .Days That Never End Always Should Remain.' Beautiful And Well Done Series ! My Family And I Would Recommend This For Children And Beatrix Potter Enthusiasts. Utterly Enchanting !!",1420848000,4,1331,4.6680851063829785
