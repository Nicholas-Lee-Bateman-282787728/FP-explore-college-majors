6926433,5,B00RCYDMJ8,Granville grew up and carries on! So glad Sir David did this reprisal of one of my all time favorites.,1437782400,4,102,4.15
6926434,4,B00RCYDMJ8,"We bought it due to seeing most of the original name in the title and of course some of the familiar faces. As the episodes began we were a little apprehensive as to the enjoyment value, however, the more we watched the better we liked the efforts of all concerned to make it a show worth every penny of the cost. It will of course never replace the original and quite honestly it was not meant to, but to be able to sit back and watch actors/actresses of such caliber is like a breath of fresh air compared to some of today's so called celebrities.",1437350400,7,549,4.238095238095238
6926435,1,B00RCYDMJ8,It was great to see the original actors from the series but the various secondary roles were not as good as in the original series and they are needed to keep things going.  After the first two episodes it just became boring.,1436227200,,225,4.357142857142857
6926436,5,B00RCYDMJ8,Very fun to watch.,1458864000,,18,3.75
6926437,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"so funny laughed all the way. I must say,that you might enjoy this series more if you had seen the original. Hope they do more of this one.",1458777600,,139,4.0

6926442,5,B00RCYDMJ8,AWESOME,1440374400,,7,7.0
6926443,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Others said this wasn't funny or the jokes were rehashed, but I found none of this to be true. I thought it was funny and a nice way to see how the store continued on. Definitely get this if you liked the first show ""open all hours"".",1439164800,5,233,3.978723404255319
6926444,5,B00RCYDMJ8,Great fun. I loved seeing so many of the original cast included in the show.,1438646400,,76,4.133333333333334
6926445,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Oh, how I've missed Granville!  He's using all his uncle Arkwright's old tricks to hold  on t'brass.  Love that they used lots of the original actors, and hope they do many more.",1438041600,4,178,4.5
8694906,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Hilarious, in some cases, funnier than the original Open All Hours, more wacky characters!!!  A laugh riot.",1518134400,,107,5.294117647058823
8694907,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Love this series, just about as funny as the original",1517788800,,53,4.4
8694908,5,B00RCYDMJ8,David Jason awesome!!!!!,1506816000,,24,7.333333333333333
8694909,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Very funny sequel (if you are into the original series)... Only problem-- we need Region 1 discs!!  C'mon BBC, get on the stick and get our Region 1 discs pressed ASAP!  Hopefully awaiting release.",1495324800,2,197,4.764705882352941
8694910,4,B00RCYDMJ8,Although good to see some of the old faces again was not the same without Ronnie Barker.,1484524800,,88,4.235294117647059
8694911,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Amazingly, even without Ronnie Barker, this is IMMENSELY watchable & funny! Granville, it appears, was VERY well taught in 'frugality' by his uncle...If you liked Open All Hours - I believe you will also like Still Open! Seeing Mrs Featherstone chase after the once-too-immature Granville as she did Arkwright, is funny to see - Mavis is back & still has issues making up her mind; Nurse Gladys Emmanuel is retired & still adds to the fun...
Enjoy!!",1470441600,3,449,4.8441558441558445

8694913,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"David Jason, is still great! "" Still Open All Hours"" has not lost it's humor.  Great to see so many of the same faces as the original.",1461456000,2,134,3.962962962962963
8694914,5,B00RCYDMJ8,"Very funny series. Watch the original ""Open All Hours"" from 1973 - 1985, and this continuation will be all the more special and you'll catch a lot of the in jokes, too. I love how they got almost all the original cast. David Jason is a favorite of mine, being the voice of Danger Mouse! The DVD is region 2, so you'll need a region-free DVD player or just use your computer/laptop like we did.  I can't wait for the second season to be available for purchase on Amazon.",1459296000,4,469,4.269662921348314
