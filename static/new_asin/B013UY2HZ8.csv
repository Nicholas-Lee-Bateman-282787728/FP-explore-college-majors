8728887,2,B013UY2HZ8,"I absolutely adore Sam Smith, so please keep that in mind while reading the review. I'm only giving it 2 stars ONLY because it appears to be an unauthorized bio on him. From my take, most of the people that spoke about him are former back ground singers, a vocal coach (who thinks a lot of himself) and not any interviews from Sam other than ones that were pulled from interviews with other people. I wish there was a bio on him that he authorized and had more music and interviews with him.  Some of the information was great but most was irrelevant to Sam and more personal opinions from others.",1477526400,,597,4.378378378378378
