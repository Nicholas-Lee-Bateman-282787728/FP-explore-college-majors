8626752,5,B00GSCLJX6,"This is a rare find ---- far too rare, I would say. We have here a remarkably detailed, consistent, precise, and thorough presentation of the later years of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period. It's hard to explain how exciting and informative this series is. It's all in Chinese, of course, so at the moment only native speakers and those who have studied the language for some years will be able to appreciate this, but it comes with my unreserved recommendation. GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS SERIES.",1404259200,2,508,4.719101123595506
