8765323,4,B01HEY8NMG,"The emotional highs and lows of the cute guys at the Rainy Color caf are what this series is all about, and if not a lot happens in each five-minute episode (twelve per season), not much needs to. Each season's awkward misunderstandings eventually get worked out.

Season one is about the slow-burning bromance between achingly cute server Aoi Tokura and brusque art student Keiichi; their friends, brash Ryota and philosophical Shion, as well as the caf's eccentric owner, help steer things in the right direction. Season two brings in several new characters (and a large dose of slapstick), with maladroit twin brothers Noel and Nicola and middle schooler Haruka -- each of them with an adolescent crush on an older man -- at the forefront. The DVD is in Japanese with English subtitles: there's no dub. If you're in the mood for a sweet, kinda-gay-but-not-really slice of life comedy, you could do a lot worse than this.",1480723200,,923,4.8789808917197455
