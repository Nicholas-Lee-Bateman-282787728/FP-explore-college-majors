3440061,3,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie was ok, but it didn't really make me care whether or not there's a part 3. If there is they need a more talented director like JJ Abrams. Michael Bay did a better job with the first film. This one has less of a head on it's shoulder. I think with sequels Bay will just give us the same stuff over and over again. Megan Fox in tight clothes running and screaming in slow motion ""not that there's anything wrong with that lol"", Decepticons after Sam and Autobots having to protect him and the humans being more developed and shown more than the Transformers.

  The fights between the Autobots and Decepticons are just messy and the movement is so quick that it's hard to keep up with what's going on. While the Transformers are just side characters in their own franchise, everything is more about Sam and his girlfriend (Megan Fox). We are hardly introduced to any of the new Autobots. The 2 new Autobots to me were as painful as 2 Jar-Jar Binks. They were annoying. While the film could have used characters like Hot Rod or the Dinobots. But even if they were in it, I don't think we'd even be introduced to them or be made to care about them. The only Autobot that we were ever made to really care about in the films is Bumble Bee, we don't really care if any of the others get ripped apart since they are undeveloped. Hell even Optimos Prime is under-used in this movie.

  Bay knows how to do very few things. Such as...blowing stuff up, making a loud movie and smothering us with patriotism and romance. The first movie had all that, but it was executed better and the movie was fresh. This one could have just used a lot more development. I mean people complained that Terminator: Salvation was all action and no brains but I think that applies to this film a lot more. It has nice effects, the acting wasn't bad and there was some fun but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. It has more battles and more action, yet it gets tiresome. While Bay's idea of good humor is not 1 but 3 scenes that have to do with either dogs humping or a little transformer humping Megan Fox's leg.",1245715200,3,2097,4.323155216284987
3440062,5,B0019M5C0Q,"This isn't a review for the blu ray, simply the movie itself. I saw this in Japan the day of release and all I can say is wow, I was deeply impressed. We all read the reviews on some of the poor acting and deviations from the original cartoon plots, but that aside it was an excellent movie. The CGI was amazing, the action was non stop, and I had a lot of really good laughs. I never take reviews from critics seriously because I have my own taste in movies, go see this movie and be the judge for yourself, unless you absolutely must have your Transformers by the book then you'll enjoy this movie.

Some of my favorite parts of the movie (no spoilers don't worry) were how they used a lot of things from the 1986 movie but it was incognito, and the made Optimus a lot tougher. The introduced some new characters, and a bunch of the no name Decepticons that used to get trashed on Saturday mornings when you were little and you'd never see again. Bottom line is despite bad critic reviews I went to see this being a die hard fan, and I was not disappointed in any way shape or form, and I don't think you will be either.",1245369600,5,1122,4.170506912442396
3440063,5,B0019M5C0Q,"In ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" Two Years Have Passed since Sam Witwicky and the Autobots saved the human race from the invading Decepticons. Now he's preparing for the biggest challenge of his life: leaving home for college. Despite his extreme heroics,the battle of Mission City has become an urban legend believed only by conspiracy theorists. Sam is still an average teenager with everyday anxieties and excitement about heading off into adulthood,separating from his parents for the first time,and vowing to be faithful to girlfriend Mikaela. Of course,he also has to explain his departure to his guardian robot,Bumblebee. Leaving home is something the Autobots understand only too well. With the destruction of the Allspark,the Transformers home planet of Cybertron is uninhabitable,and the Autobots(Optimus Prime,Bumblebee,Ironhide,Ratchet,The Sisters(Arcee,Chromia,& Moonracer),The Twins(Mudflap & Skids),Sideswipe & Jolt)make the best of their lives on earth,working in league with the military as part of a TOP SECRET team called NEST.Operating alongside their human counterparts,field commanders Major Lennox and USAF Master Sergeant Epps,the NEST TEAM seeks to hunt down whatever remaining Decepticons are still hiding on earth. Unfortunately,even as the Autobots try to make a new life among humans,they discover they may not be welcome. National Security Advisor Theodore Galloway,driven to prove that all Transformers should be banished from earth,endeavors to terminate NEST,believing the Autobots very presence may endanger the human race. Optimus Prime,the leader of the Autobots,agrees to leave our planet if the governments of the world wish it... but he warns Galloway to consider what happens if the Autobots leave earth defenseless. Meanwhile at school,Sam adjusts to his pushy,legend-in-his-own mind roommate,Leo,and an equally aggressive temptation in the form of a new co-ed,Alice. Sam does his best to navigate college life,until suddenly he's besieged by visions flashing across his brain like thunderbolts. The Decepticons soon learn what Sam doesn't know;that he alone holds the key to the outcome of the struggle between evil and the ultimate power of good. A normal life will have to wait. With the help of the Autobots,the soldiers of NEST,and an old adversary-turned-ally,former Sector 7 Agent Simmons,Sam and Mikaela must uncover the secret history of the Transformers presence on earth,and the sacrifices that have to be made to save it from an ancient threat sworn on returning here for revenge... an ancient Decepticon named THE FALLEN.",1245369600,4,2584,5.749347258485639

3440109,1,B0019M5C0Q,"i loved the first transformers, the acting/humor was superb and the action was AMAZING. I was super anxious for transformers 2 and after about an hr I was anxious to leave. I couldn't take it anymore, everything was stepped up to a bad degree. Too loud, too much action, too much horrendous jokes and way too many robots! Half the time i was trying to figure out whos who and there were so many plot holes that bugged me, this all being in the first hr alone. There were three characters that I truly DETESTED, the twin robots and that greasy haired buffoon of roommate, it doesn't get any more annoying than those three. GAHHH and when all three of them were in the same scene I wanted to kill myself.

3440112,3,B0019M5C0Q,"I watched this with my 14 year old son thinking perhaps we could both enjoy it... well, one of us did.  My son gave this 4 stars and I gave it two, so three is the compromise.  In this film, the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, is brought back to life from the bottom of the ocean.  When he flies back to Cybertron, we are introduced to the most ancient Decepticon of all, Fallen.  When Megatron bows down to Fallen, Fallen becomes the new leader of the Decepticons.  He commands Megatron to work with the Decepticons to find the Matrix of Leadership which has been hidden on earth for thousands of years.  Fallen wants the Matrix of Leadership to power up an ancient machine called the Star Harvester, which has been hidden by his ancient Decepticons in an Egyptian pyramid.  The Star Harvester, once powered, takes all the energy from the sun and produces Energon, the lifeblood of the Transformers.  The only problem is that the Primes swore never to harvest a sun if it served living beings.  Optimus Prime can't and won't allow Fallen to harvest our sun which means that Fallen must eventually defeat Optimus.  Fallen's biggest problem is finding the Matrix of Leadership- he needs to find All Spark in order to do it.  Sam Witwicky somehow brushes up next to All Spark and absorbs all its power and knowledge and become target #1 of Fallen.  Who will win- Fallen or Optimus?  Will Sam be dissected to get All Spark's information & power?  Will earth's sun be destroyed?  you need to watch to find out.

Parents, it's fun to watch this with your teens- just to see them laugh, but this won't interest an adult.  Your teens will love the action, the transformers themselves and of course, Sam's beautiful girlfriend.  You, the adult, won't approve of the unnecessary cursing, close up shots of the girl's body every 5 minutes or the length of the movie (2 1/2 HOURS!).  You, the adult,  will be looking at your watch, wondering when it will end.  The film needs serious editing, which could have saved it from a sense of endless explosions, breaking machines and meaninglessness.  The cursing and sexuality (no sex) of the filming makes me recommend this for 14 and up.  The plot isn't bad, but it wasn't executed well.  Another negative is the sound quality.  It kept changing throughout the movie, with some words intelligible and others a complete mystery.  You couldn't understand the Transformers at all and sometimes, as in battle scenes, it sounds as if a Transformer is talking, but all you can discern is gibberish.  In the end, I don't think I could recommend this to an adult- but teen boys will love it.",1503100800,,2623,4.657952069716775

3440144,3,B0019M5C0Q,"A pretty good movie. I'd probably have given it 3 and half stars, but that's not an option. The story starts to get a little campy. The human love story from the first movie becomes strained and strange. You start to not really care what happens to them.  I think the series would have gone better if they had planned a certain number of movies and then made and over arcing plot or story. This is still a highly entertaining movie but as a Transformer fan, I was disappointed. The Transformers are pretty cool, though Optimus and Bumble Bee start to become the only really noticeable and likeable Autobots (when they had tons to choose from and they could have made you care about others besides just these two). Megatron coming back to life was a little clich, and it seemed dumb that the all spark revived him but they didn't do the same with prime and they had a piece the whole time. So the story holes, lack of really good engaging storyline and the lack of much real character development start to make the series take a nose dive. you end up just liking it because it's a transformers movie (kind of like some of the later Star Wars). You just really want to watch a good movie about the Transformers, like the first one, but you settle to just see another couple hours of great special effects and hear Optimus Prime be the awesome leader and hero that he is. They had some much material that they could have used from the original series, awesome stuff, but they just didn't seem to care or something.",1491868800,,1511,4.4352517985611515

3440206,2,B0019M5C0Q,"I saw the first Transformers when it first came out, and didn't care for it much.  The battle sequences were noisy and confusing. I found I couldn't tell the ""good guys"" apart from the ""bad guys.""  I admired the effects overall, and the film certainly gives sound designers and editors a nice showpiece.  But I never really desired to see any of the sequels.

The other afternoon, I had some free time on my hands, and wanted to watch something mindless.  I sure picked the right film.  I mean, where do I start in running down the reasons this film is stinker?!?!

#1:  Script/plot.  What a mess.  In typical form for director Michael Bay, scenes of more than a few seconds are rare.  He must have and assume we do too, the lowest attention span of anyone on the planet.  It creates a frantic pace that's exhausting to keep up with and never worth it.  The dialogue is INANE, where characters are sketched in moments and then forever locked into their type.  Many don't even have a real character developed at all:  I mean, Josh Duhamel has been in two of these, ostensibly in a major role, and yet I have ZERO idea what kind of character he is.  The story bounces all over and little is rationally explained.  The film basically wants us to just watch little chunks of storytelling and not worry about how it ties together.

#2: The action.  It's what we're really here for, isn't it?  And it's as bad as the first film.  Again, I couldn't tell the transformers apart readily.  The Fallen (what a DUMB name) looks a lot like the good guy with the Liam Neeson accent.  When they fight, no one can tell them apart.  It's just a bunch of clanking grey metal.  And there is no consistency as to what kills one of these creature/machines.  Some get huge holes punched right through their middles and keep going.  Others are flung against a wall and die.  They seem to be easy to kill or indestructible at will.  I can only imagine the work the special effects team put into all this, and it looks pretty spectacular until you try to make sense out of the combat.  The climactic scenes, set near the ancient pyramids of Egypt (one of which is utterly destroyed!) are confusing locations.  The camp where our GIs await Sam Witwicky (our hero, played by Shia LeBeouf) seems to be near the action at times and FAR away at others.  Sam seems to be right there, and then he seems to be far away still.  It's all so stupid.

#3:  Acting.  Terrible.  Shia LeBeouf is clearly barely interested in this role, and he's the best of the bunch.  It ranges from generic, I'm-here-to-get-paid (Josh  Duhamel or Tyrese) to frantically over-the-top (John Turturro, trying his best to be comic relief but instead just being annoying) to unwatchable (Megan Fox).  Megan Fox is simply the worst actress I have ever seen.  Sure, she's built like a model...but she brings not one single second of believable character or emotion to the film.  She has no comic timing.  No ability to connect with those around her, making her ""love"" scenes with Shia truly cringeworthy.  Simply awful.  Awful, awful, awful.  Wow, she's bad.

#4:  Humor.  Well, the first film succeeded in being entertaining early on with some amusing bits where the world gets introduced to Transformers.  There were some cheap but at least genuine laughs there.  NOW, all attempts at humor are forced. LaBeouf has lost virtually all his natural charm in this film, so you don't even enjoy his energy.  There are two little ""jive talking"" transformers who are merely uncomfortable and unfunny racial stereotypes.  It's all ham-fisted and not funny.

#5:  Sound.  The film sounds great.  If you have a surround sound speaker and good sub-woofer, get ready for the windows to rattle.  Again, these guys do a great job in the service of a bad film.  They are the only reason the film isn't one-star.

REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is simply amateurish and insulting.  Insulting to our intelligence and pocket books.  Why, oh why, did I watch this?",1473120000,,3976,4.625

3440326,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was the first action movie in a long time to actually bore me.  Lots of other reviewers have said it best the film is too long, has too many explosions with no real point to them, way too much slapstick comedy and no overall story whatsoever.  I still don't get why Shia Labeouf's character is important to the Autobots he is not Albert Einstein or anything.  Megan Fox is basic eye candy but she never gets semi-naked or does anything remotely interesting in the movie.

I grew up with the cartoon show and I thought the first Transformers movie was decent.  It had a plausible story and worked for the most part.  This 2nd live action film is a train wreck that never flipping over the whole movie.

To me the best Transformers movie to come out is still the cartoon movie which came out in 1986.  Maybe if the live action movies would make a ""Unicron"" aka Death Star transformer it might actual be a good story to film in live action.  Any story is better than what this movie came up with.

While watching Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I was thinking of another sequel that came out in the same time period that was downright awful ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest"".  Both films are follow-ups to decent box office hits, but both sequels are hard to watch and make it through to the end.  I felt the same way watching the pirates sword fight play, as I did watching the transformers fighting it just gets monotonous and boring.  Kind of like the ""A team"" where 10,000 rounds get fired and no one gets injured, hurt, or killed.  You don't buy it as a viewer and just start yawning.

The devastator robot was really dumb looking as well.  How come they just did not use the actual 6 construction vehicles from the old TV show paint them lime green and use the CGI to make Devastator look cool like the cartoon version.  With Michael Bay's unlimited budget for this film that would have looked so much better than what they came up with.

I would rate this film 1 and a half to 2 stars.  It is not worth your time and the human characters will annoy you in no time flat.  Go watch the wonderful cartoon version from 1986 instead.  Half the time and a much better overall movie.",1440979200,,2228,4.398533007334963

3440350,3,B0019M5C0Q,"THE FILM: If the first Transformers movie was passable, this one comes up short of the low standards set by its predecessor. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN has bigger action setpieces, but at the expense of a coherent script, likable characters and a general reason to give a crap about anything that happens. If all you care about are action sequences with hunks of metal duking it out, you'll be in heaven. I was not. My sole memory of seeing this in theaters was leaving with a headache. While I didn't have the same experience watching it on Blu-ray some five years later, a lot of what is wrong with this film stuck out to me even more. Since the AllSpark from the previous entry is all but destroyed, they had to come up with a new MacGuffin. They came up with Energon and something called the Matrix of Leadership, which is as ill-defined as the AllSpark was, except that there's more pointless backstory and exposition to go with it. Another thing that got more screen-time was Michael Bay's unique sense of ""humor."" We're treated to two Autobots who are vaguely racist caricatures as well as an abundance of sexual humor that falls flat most of the time. And more exposition. And military porn. And things hitting other things in slo-mo. There is literally nothing to admire about this movie other than some great scenery, landscape shots and (admittedly) jaw-dropping visual effects. This movie is about Transformers, but the most succinct plot description is ""Guy finally says 'I love you' to his girlfriend."" Pathetic. This movie is pure eye candy, to be sure, but it's the kind that you can break your teeth on if you aren't careful.

THE EXTRAS: This sequel is bigger than its predecessor, and one can say the same about the special features as well. There as easily twice as much to dig through as the first movie's Special Edition. Again, the bulk of the material is contained in a multi-part documentary, this time almost as long as the film itself, called ""The Human Factor: Exacting the Revenge of the Fallen."" Having been nominally aware of this film's production problems, this documentary put most of them front and center for all to see. These range from the writer's strike which forced pre-production to start with a 13-page outline (and then having to scramble to finish a script once the strike broke) to shooting-related problems such as a fire on-location and not being able to start shooting in Giza due to permit issues. And of course, there is Michael Bay himself, who likes to shoot quickly, is very demanding, and quite difficult to work with at times. Not only that, but the film wasn't even finished by the time it was supposed to premier to the world in Tokyo, Japan (although this was mostly coloring/VFX shots). Similar to the first one, there wasn't a whole lot of time devoted to the writing process, but lots having to do with character design, locations, stunts, and visual effects that ordinarily go into blockbusters like this. All things considered, this making-of documentary was more entertaining and enlightening than the film itself. There were also several shorter features that dealt with the press tour and premier in Tokyo, the Transformers toy line, and a featurette entitled ""Giant Effing Movie,"" essentially a condensed version of the ""Making-of"" that had a more light-hearted tone and focused on the explosions and goofing off. The most informative feature outside of the main documentary was ""Deconstructing Visual Bayhem"" which let you see 16 previs/animatics (an essential part of Michael Bay's pre-production work) along with commentary by his collaborator Steve Yamamoto. It's viewable with just the animatic, or the animatic side-by-side with the finished scene. Rounding things out are about 6 minutes of deleted/alternate scenes, Linkin Park's ""New Divide"" music video and a handful of marketing materials ranging from trailers and TV spots to promotional art and tie-in merchandise. Additionally, there are some non-video features that give a wealth of information on Transformers, and even let you visually customize vehicles and see what happens when you add AllSpark to it. And on the feature disc, there is commentary by Michael Bay and two of the credited writers (Orci/Kurtzman). The movie might not be that great, but holy crap is there a lot of stuff to check out on the second disc!

OVERALL: TRANSFORMERS isn't really an intellectual type of cinema, and it doesn't claim to be either. Director Michael Bay is mostly concerned with giving the audience an incredible cinematic experience that looks and feels ""cool."" On that front, he succeeds admirably although his style can interfere with that sometimes. I don't particularly care for this sequel, and it certainly isn't the Transformers movie I'd go to first, but for what it's worth the film is effective in the goal it sets out to achieve. What really makes this worth buying on Blu-ray, however, is the astonishing amount of extra material that enriches the experience the film provides. Even if the film isn't your favorite, it will look great on your home theater system and you have a lot of stuff to dig into besides the main feature.",1436313600,,5175,4.940298507462686

3440376,1,B0019M5C0Q,"They had to be kidding me with this one!
I saw this movie opening Saturday with some friends and it broke my heart! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and surely at the time the worst action movie ever made! Aside from the action and visuals, this movie had the exact same problems (and more!) you could find in some of the worst movies of all time, including the aforementioned ""Batman and Robin""! At least B&R was camp from the get-go but with TF2, there are no excuses in its defense! I've always said that Michael Bay isn't a filmmaker, he's a businessman posing as a filmmaker! Whatever his position on a movie, he's going to put his trademarks--most of them unprofessional and juvenile--into his films, and if anyone tries to stand in his way and say no then they'll eventually have to back down. The equivalent would be standing in Walter White's way!
The previous movie could have cut 30 minutes out and you wouldn't have missed a thing! This one could lose more than an hour! Imagine all that time you could have had at the snack bar AND taking a bathroom break instead! I had a bad feeling going into this movie since the major consensus was that some of the things that were ""good"" about the first one would be multiplied but the bad things from said movie would also increase but by tenfold! Boy were they right! Let's get into them.
It's always been said that character can trump a bad story. Good stories are really hard to concoct (though I won't hold that as an excuse) but characters you can become attached to! Sadly, from the get go, it was obvious that Bay and Co. had no concerns about whatever script Kurtzman, Orci, and Krueger concocted; but unfortunately that same kind of laziness and contempt applied to their characters. It could have lost half of them and nothing would have been lost, most of all Ramon Rodriguez's Leo, whose picture belongs right alongside the definition of ""pointless."" Everyone talks about Mudskip and Flaps being racial stereotypes but it doesn't matter anyway since they also ended up being two of the worst and most pointless characters in a movie anyway! I thought it also was stupid and pointless to give the Transformers bodily functions such as spitting and even farting but I'll stick with the characters for now. Tyrese Gibson's character as well, should have never come back as all he did was state the obvious, talk when not needed, stand there, and do some really stupid things like throw firing gas into the area his own squad was positioned. John Turturro came back and pulled off what seemed like a really forced reversal of character. I had no idea what Michael Bay was going for with him! Last movie, he did everything he could to portray Agent Simmons as awful, incompetent, unsympathetic, bad with words, and worthy of being pissed on--all trademarks of a lazily and juvenilely conceived villain, especially from someone like Michael Bay. In this movie, he's supposed to be on the good guys' side now but he never gets any development or convincing-enough material to come off as a guy that Bay and Co. want us to root for! The guy was woefully underdeveloped and that's no excuse since this is obviously his sophomore outing.
Typical of the first movie's soundtrack, many of the songs chosen for this movie had NOTHING whatsoever to do with the film they were associated with hence they came off more as someone's random rock playlist. If all this doesn't infuriate you, surely the horrible and juvenile attempts at humor (which are unfortunately thrown at you every other scene), the handful of disgusting/disturbing scenes that have nothing to do with the movie's point (if there even was one), and the dialogue that's so putrid and stupid enough to make your ears bleed (as it surely felt with me) would? No? Well, there's more!
The premise of Earth being once inhabited by old Transformers seemed to me like a very drastic alteration of the ""Transformers"" reality that also came off as too much for me to accept and a no-win situation at the same time! It would feel weird if the main characters just shrugged off this significant historical event, but the alternative approach would be making it a significant thread that wouldn't fit into this series very well. I also thought it was a shame that Tony Todd, one of my favorite actors ever, had to be involved in this movie because he always delivers a strong performance either through physical or vocal acting but his character, despite being the new lead villain, was both underused and uninteresting as an antagonist! Don't even get me started on Megatron's character or ""usefulness"", ugh! Which brings me to the story's big bad plan: using their ultimate device to destroy the Earth's sun! It's the worst plan since Ivy joined up with Mr. Freeze in the aforementioned (again!) B&R to ice Gotham's population so that her plants could repopulate Gotham! Just like Ivy would've ended up killing the plants she wanted to save, the Decepticons would've also destroyed themselves along with everything and everyone else--at least they would've put us all out of our miseries and saved us from watching anymore of this piece of filth!
**On one final, and maybe personal, note; I wanted to point out the one missed opportunity that I felt had the most potential in this movie but was completely gutted! Since it's one of the most reviled parts of the movie (but misunderstood in my opinion), it's quite an eccentric choice to say the least. In this case, it's the un/under appreciated errand boy known as government agent Theodore Galloway. Portrayed by Tony Award winning actor Benjamin Hickey, he was given a great contrast in ideals with regards to fanboy favorite Optimus Prime, namely his utilitarian notion to give up Sam to meet the demands of the all powerful Decepticons in the hopes of reaching some sort of truce--which actually comes off a bit more justified in his position when Optimus becomes killed, you know for the time being. The aforementioned overly fanboy favorite Optimus Prime  on the other hand stands firm (maybe a little too much) in his usual anti-utilitarian ideals with regards to the situation. This would've made for a great theme as these two principles clashed with each other in the hopes of being the one to solve the Decepticon problem they currently faced. Unfortunately, Bay & Co. don't give Galloway much of any chance to make his case or even able to find some common ground with the big guy, most notably ending their first meeting with Optimus avoiding his questions with some weak ones of his own while Galloway has the camera cut away from him after the last one is proposed. I've always been a big critic of Optimus Prime and believe that his character, at least the live action one in these films, is one of the most overrated characters of all time: no background, no motivation, no character development, an embodiment of a scriptwriter's conceit, etc. should be enough justification! Prime may be filled with kind words and noble intentions, though also a touch of disarming self-righteousness here, but Galloway also comes off like the kind of person who also had a point. Galloway, to me, came off from the start as a very under appreciated errand boy who was just trying to do his job with some very tough bosses (one of them being the President for crying out loud!) and even had a right to be upset with the Autobots after the little show they put on for the public in Shanghai. Instead of dramatizing this difficult choice between the (possibly misguided) preferences of the heroes and the (possibly mistaken) prescription of Galloway and his fellow officialsbetween the dignity of the individual (Sam) and the welfare of the planet's overall populationthe movie ends up playing Galloway for all the oily malice it can muster. This was never made more clear when, after the bungle that was the end of that first meeting, both the juvenile writing and lazy filmmaking of Bay & Co. had Galloway later barge into the military base and emphatically start saying that he was now in charge! What?! Obviously Optimus's ideals have to win out, you know because he's the ultimate hero of the flick and is the universal fanboy favorite and all, but admittedly it was actually pretty good that his ideals did win out with him not even being around and alive at the time. On the other hand the guys behind this movie unfortunately must have wanted a human antagonist so bad that they ended up sacrificing serious drama for theatrical evil, ugh! I'm sorry but, as aware as I am of Michael Bay's fondness of breaches of character (and he had quite a few going on in this one movie alone), this was simply unforgivable! To me, this right here is indicative enough of all that is wrong with this movie, this franchise, its creators, and, from both a financial and critical standpoint, the casual viewer.**
I cannot recommend avoiding the viewing and/or purchase of this movie enough! If you're curious about the Transformers live action series, start with the first movie. It being mediocre at best though, it won't satisfy with repeat viewings. That being said, the first movie would be acceptable to look into but that's where it should end!

P.S. The ""old"" saying, ""Just turn your brain off!"" is just something that people who never use theirs from the start say. Sorry, but I couldn't resist. :P",1432512000,2,9373,4.753222836095764

This is like my all time favorite movie.
The film does a good job at distinguishing itself from the first film. It goes into the adventure genre, taking our now fugitive characters on a trip through Egypt.
Also, this film is hilarious! It always has me laughing out loud for pretty much the entire time!
Everyone always hates this movie, but when I first saw it in theaters, when the film cut to credits, everyone in the theater started to clap and cheer. So yeah, this is an amazing movie regardless of what the critics have to say!",1427328000,,617,4.421052631578948

3440483,2,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie plays out like it was written by marketing executives running a bunch of focus groups.

I actually liked the first movie.  I was even willing to buy the idea of Megatron transforming into an alien plane.  The shrinking allspark was a bit of a stretch, but I could even sort of overlook that.

This movie, on the other hand, simply had too many flaws.  The goofball twins and decrepit SR-71 didn't seem credible.  A couple of the rogue Decepticons also seemed too cartoonish.  Worse yet, there's a transformer who changes into something that undermines the very foundations of the franchise.  Finally, on a purely technical level, the CGI is notably worse.  In some scenes it looks so obviously fake that it's distracting.

Ultimately, it feels like they were trying to target too many demographics and ended up with a movie that didn't work well for any.  The cartoonish aspects seem aimed at a younger crowd, yet there were mature themes that were well beyond them.  What worked well about the first movie was that Michael Bay played it straight.  This installment in the series is just a muddled mess.",1417910400,,1114,4.769633507853404

3440600,1,B0019M5C0Q,"ROTF is awful, it's a putrid, hateful piece of cinema - and by ""hateful"" I mean it hates the audience, it craps on them, it insults them, it assaults them, and it yells at them constantly. This movie is cinematic diarrhea, it has nothing to say so it shouts as loudly and confusingly as it can. I was dragged me to see it in the theaters by a buddy, and I am confident they will some day have to answer to their maker for that misdeed.

ROTF is a visual cacophony of a million moving parts all over the place on top of shaky-cam. It's incredibly stupid, it stands for nothing and inverts itself on its morality time and time again - especially for our ""heroes"" - its so-called plot is nonsensical to a degree that is mind-numbing, it's base and cheap and racist and ugly, it uses its camera to leer at every woman in the cast under the age of 30 with an eye-rapist manner, it's unholy bloated, and even its helmer - Michael Bay - called it ""crap"" despite having an active loathing for the audience who he says will go see it no matter how bad it is.

It's not clever or creative or interested in the franchise it's representing or concerned about the audience whatsoever, it is a 2.5-hour long slugfest to sell GM cars and toys and tie-in merchandising opportunities and it doesn't care a lick about entertainment beyond the lowest common denominator.

It is a dump truck full of Lucky Charms and McDonalds hamburgers and Twinkies, slowly turning rancid, being poured over the audience until they eat so much that they hate the taste of that junk food which they used to crave.

It made action scenes and giant robots and explosions incredibly boring by their utter lack of novelty or restraint.",1404086400,,1695,4.475728155339806
3440601,5,B0019M5C0Q,Hated it the first time I saw it. But that was when it was in theatres. I decided to let go and enjoy the spectacle and it was a great ride. A LOT of fun.,1404000000,,154,3.4285714285714284
3440602,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael Bay's directing style ruins this movie (and all the other Transformers movies), primarily because the entire movie is ""fast, fast, fast!""  What I mean, is that he uses rapid dialogue between characters, short scenes, and fast camera cuts, even when the scenes are filled with dialogue and the context doesn't warrant the fast pace.  In short, there is ""action"" in every single scene, even if it doesn't have explosions (which is rare).

I suspect these movies are marketed specifically to the tween-teen crowd, which might react positively to the ""fast, fast, fast!"" style of Michael Bay.  I'm young, but even for me watching 20 minutes of this movie gives me a headache.",1403913600,,679,4.982300884955753
3440603,5,B0019M5C0Q,Action packed movie worth seeing over and over!! My family plans on finishing out the movie series! We loved the transformers!!,1403740800,,127,5.095238095238095
3440604,4,B0019M5C0Q,"If you were a fan of the first ""Transformers"" movie (and I was), then you'll most likely enjoy this second film in the series as well.

As the film opens we learn that the Transformers have been on Earth since the days of the cavemen, and that Seven Prime robots traveled the galaxy looking for destroying Suns to create Energon. They would only destroy Suns of solar systems where there was no life. But one of the Primes, lands on Earth and wants to destroy our Sun, killing everything. The other primes cast him out and he is sent into exile, now known as the Fallen.

Sam is leaving for college, and is busy trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela alive via webcam and phone calls. He also tries to send his Autobot protector, Bumblebee, back to join Optimus Prime and the other Autobots. Optimus and his team, along with the soldiers from the first film, are traveling the world and destroying the Decepticons which have gone into hiding. In China, Optimus learns that the Fallen is going to return.

Sam finds a piece of the Cube from the first film and when touched it activates, turning all of the Witwicky appliances into Decepticons. By touching the Cube shard, Sam also begins to suffer from visions. Sam turns to the Autobots to help him figure out what the visions mean, and must help them stop the Fallen from returning.

Michael Bay really amped up everything for this movie. The action is non-stop, the visuals are stunning, the CGI is jaw-dropping, and there are quite a few laughs throughout. The humor is very crude, but pretty funny. Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas look stunning, and while there is no actual nudity in the film, there are a few scenes which push the sexuality presented in the film up a few notches, so parents with pre-teens may not want to throw this on for family fun night.

The only real issue I had with the film is the running time. At 149 minutes, this film simply runs too long. There are multiple scenes that could've ended up on the cutting room floor, and it wouldn't have hurt the narrative at all. Still, if you want a fun evening, and are in the mood for something big and shiny with lots of explosions...looking to re-discover that 16-year old kid inside yourself, then I highly recommend you give this a view.",1403654400,,2264,4.53921568627451
3440605,5,B0019M5C0Q,I really love to watch Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition) since it is fun and fascinating to watch on DVD.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants it.,1403568000,,175,4.645161290322581
3440606,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I hated this film and I am so sorry that I stupidly bought it. The reasons why I hated this thing are as follows:

- absence of any kind of scenario

- boring, repetitive action scenes

- lack of humour

- too much of darn Sam Witwicky which also means much too much of darn Shia LaBoeuf

- Sam parents were supposed to be funny - they are just obnoxious jerks

- you can't really watch this film with your kids - the language is too strong, even for a 12 years old (it should really be rated ""15"");

- noble Optimus Prime is misused in this film in every possible way

- a completely ridiculous vilain

- Megatron is reduced to be a sidekick (!)

- Starscream is reduced to a pathetic, miserable, crawling lackey

- grotesque, ridiculous, gross robots with golden teeth (!)

God, I hated this film! After like 50 minutes I just wanted it to finish already but I kept watching it hoping for at least a great finale - but it never came... Let's say it again, I deeply regret that I bought and watched this.

3440609,4,B0019M5C0Q,This was a really good movie. After watching the first one I was very much interested in seeing the second Transformers movie.

3440617,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Revenge of the Fallen is enjoyable but lacks many good qualities that made the first Transformers great. The dialogue seems forced, and unnecessary, the actors even seem like they're not trying their best. The movie starts right away with the Autobots, with an over the top action scene. Quickly decimating excitement, which there isn't that much throughout the movie. Not only is the dialogue irritating, the movie itself feels cliche. The story had much potential, but obviously that was not the priority during the making. Saying don't buy this or buy this is not the point of this review. Everyone has different taste, this could seem like trash to one but seem like treasure to another. To those die hard Transformer fans watch this movie with the thoughts ""This is not a Transformers movie, it's just another SyFy with the title Transformers"" and it might be at least fun.

3440628,5,B0019M5C0Q,"I am writing this review more for the excellent customer service received by Amazon than for the content of the movie.  My daughter rented this movie via AmazonPrime.  She complained of the movie stopping a lot and she would have to exit the Roku (the streaming device used), and go back in and select the movie again.  This happened multiple times, but she was eventually able to view the entire movie.  She's 13 so I guess the stopping and starting annoyed her, but not to the point where she gave up completely!  Anyway, I just figured streaming is what it is and sometimes the quality is just not there.  However, I received an email from Amazon stating they were aware of the issues with the poor streaming quality and they refunded my rental cost.  This was such a surprise to me because I did not prompt a resolution to the issue.  Amazon took it upon themselves to make sure that I, as their customer, was completely satisfied.

I rented this movie and took the chance that it was not too scary for him (he watches episodes of Goosebumps).  He loved seeing Bumblebee and enjoyed the movie.,1392595200,,435,4.6103896103896105

3440650,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Let's face it - you seen one car transform into a robot, you seen them all.  I'm constantly amazed that these movies blithely ignore conservation of mass (as Terminator 2 so voraciously attempted to adhere to) and expect us to believe that putting a humanoid face on machines somehow imbues them with human characteristics.  Likewise the improbable scenes of tiny helicopters picking up tons and tons of robot in order to transport it - not likely to happen.  Still, it was of some entertainment value to those in my household who tend to overlook such things.  Sadly, there was very little plot or character development involved throughout.",1389225600,,641,4.962616822429907

The story is thin, the plot weak, and the acting phone-it-in from everyone but Shia (who, believe it or not, can actually act ...sometimes). Got this for $1.99 on a deal of the day from Amazon.

There is not one redeeming moment in this movie. In fact, the movie should be burned. Stereotypes and insults more fitting to a movie before the Civil Rights act in 1965.

I just love everything about him. If I were to take a guess why this movie got a lot of bad reviews, I would say that it is because the first half of the movie is nothing but perverted jokes and bad content. I have no idea what is up with Michael Bay, but Transformers (in the beginning) was made for kids. When did Transformers become a perverted adult joke book? It takes awhile until the big story comes together, but it really isn't all that bad. I can honestly say I don't care about the humans of this movie at all. Really, who cares? It's called Transformers for a reason. I like this movie for Optimus and the Autobots (even though Bay screwed up Skids, Mudflap, and Jetfire.) I'd encourage all Transformers fans to look at the big picture. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox (the horribly perverted actors as they are) are NOT the main focus here. If you really don't like this movie because of it's bad content and slow story, thats ok.

For a brainless sci-fi movie, this movie does a decent job of keeping movie-goers interested in the plot, however ridiculous it is.  Optimus gets into a fight with a Decepticon and dies.  The kid, who always seems to get top seceret government clearance, just comes across a dumb kid who can't even act smart.  He's basically a useless bystander.  I kind of wonder how stupid these decepticons must be when they search Earth on every continent to find the ""sun killer.""  The Fallen built a pyramid to put it in--and it's a tourist attraction.  Seriously, does he lose his keys a lot too?  What an idiot.  Now a dumb kid manages to beat The Fallen to his own pyramid, finds the matrix and uses it to bring Optimus to life.  The old airplane guy dies and the autobots manage to attach his parts to Optimus.  He kills the Fallen just in time to use a bunch of ""Dirty Harry"" catch phrases to make it even more stupid.",1385510400,2,1022,4.377659574468085

Ugh. This flick is so forgettable. If you haven't seen it yet, all I can say is that there is a battle in the middle that was great... and most everything else is fluffy eye candy that even a 15-year-old boy would probably tire of after by the end credits. The last 30 minutes or more are basically unwatchable, like an extended intro to a video game. It's too bad, because some of the interpersonal interactions get interesting between Sam and his parents, his girlfriend, his role in the war, etc. If they had cut out two or three fights and used decent script-writing to accomplish certain storyline developments (as opposed to having robot scuffles to uncover mysteries) it might've been a decent movie.

3440741,3,B0019M5C0Q,"This is one movie that needed a bit of help. The action was top notch and the effects were really good. The story was straightforward enough, but the sexual jokes and innuendoes were extremely annoying enough to make me wonder if this movie was actually bucking for an ""R"" rating. Not only did I not find them funny, I was  embarrassed that kids would actually see all that. Ron and Judy Witwicky were only good toward the end and spoiled what was a halfway decent picture otherwise when they weren't in it. I could forgive Skids and Mudflap, after all, they were aliens, though just as annoying. I will say that the Smackdown in the forest with Prime and the Decepticons and the battle with the Fallen at the end was well worth seeing. I honestly believed in both of those encounters that Megatron and the Fallen both had no idea of just what kind of power and rage that Optimus was truly capable of. The movie is still good, but it could have been better. It didn't need any more additions, it sorely needed some things left out.",1368921600,,1031,4.455026455026455

3440744,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Well, they're consistent.

You want action, they give you action, you want a story, they try to deliver one from B.C. and beyond.  There's a lot of razzle-dazzle, glitz, and bling, making it pretty to look at but it's still hollow to the core.  They even recycle some of the plot devices from the first film (from one-liners to the expected explosions, it's all the same).  This `new' story involves a sliver or two from the destroyed AllSpark.  (Rule one; never presume anything is truly finished or over.)  Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is all grown up and off to college.  In a scene reminiscent of those dreadful boy and his dog flicks, Sam dumps his faithful car, doing everything but throwing stones at it and ordering it to run free!  Naturally, Sam spends little to no time in college, as he is immediately embroiled in another tussle with the bad bots the Decepticons.  Magnified mayhem ensues on a grand scale.  John Turturro, the human villain from the last movie, is now a good guy (but he is replaced in this outing by another officious twit serving in the same type of role).  And!  They're still just as squeamish about death, showing only the vehicles and buildings and whatnot that the robots destroy, never the people who are inside them dead or dying.  Only two pseudo-death scenes are highlighted and both don't amount to anything.  It's all quite cautious and cowardly, revealing their target audience.  (Death as an abstraction doesn't serve anyone.)

It's hard to invest anything in these films because they're just one long battle sequence after another; a flurry of kinetic energy that goes nowhere.  Okay, yes, they do go to Egypt for more of the same.  Repetition is the key to these films.",1367971200,,1715,4.755932203389831

Well, the first movie wasn't all bad, and had some fun moments. This one, though, is just shot after shot of the various transformers switching back and forth between forms, often for no apparent reason. What little plot there is involves a not-very-interesting villain, and a teenager's struggle to maintain a long-distance relationship as he starts college, with a girl whose jealousy is ridiculous considering what's supposed to be her extreme hotness (Megan Fox, if you like that sort of thing).

The weakness is that so much of the dialogue has been written to impress and amuse tweens who are accustomed to the Disney channel. The flippant language, the histrionic whining... I could go on but I'll just sum it up with a quote: ""Punkass Decepticon!""

The other thing is that it's extremely sexual for what I thought was a family movie. The depiction of the protagonist's freshman year experience at Princeton is about as realistic as the scantily-clad Megan Fox.",1358035200,,607,4.9411764705882355

What it lacks in plot it makes up for with gratuitous dog sex scenes and crude jokes.

Because of said Gratuitous dog sex I don't even feel comfortable letting children watch it.

That said it's flawed. A tiny piece of the cube resurrected Megatron, but a whole quest was needed to resurrect Optimus Prime? Also at the end of the original Bumble Bee could speak, so why couldn't he in this one? And the new Autobots added in this one weren't very bright.

More importantly that political engineering in the movie is disgusting. When the original was made the Republicans had the White House, so the movie just used the phrase ""The President"", and has the government siding with the Autobots against the Dicepticons. This one was made when the Democrats have the White House, so it uses the name ""President Obama"", and has a government that impedes the war and fears the Autobots.",1356048000,,930,4.80625

3440801,5,B0019M5C0Q,"There is several reviews about the story of Transformers Revenge of the fallen so i will not add to the discussions.

Video: 1080p High Definition 2.40:1 aspect ratio and 1.78:1 for IMAX Sequences
Audio: DTS-HD-MA 5.1

As far as the IMAX Sequences, there is roughly about 5 mins. of them spread through different scenes of the film itself. Compared to The Dark Knight, where there is 7 Mins. of IMAX Sequences, People think that there is little IMAX scenes in this film because these scenes are spread apart which makes it seem like there is less.

In this film i think that there is a lot of footage shot in the IMAX camera considering that it costs 1 million dollars to film 1 min. of footage with the IMAX Camera.

Special Features: there is a whole other Blu-ray disc for the special features which contains several hours of special features which will make any transformers fan happy.

By the way in this version of the film Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Two-Disc Special Edition (Big-Screen Edition) Compared to the other Two-Disc Special Edition and the DVD, I have Compared them since i have both this version and the DVD, and i wouldn't call this version extended, but this film is 30 Secs. longer that the DVD or other Blu-ray disc version. Including small extended scenes in action scenes and in talking scenes.

Please let me know if this review is helpful to you, and if not let me know also so that i can learn to write better and more helpful reviews.

3440803,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Everyone knows what Transformers is. A sentient mechanical life form comes to Earth and gains asylum. Their planet, Cybertron was nigh destroyed in a terrible war led by Megatron, and The Fallen Prime. Optimus and his Autobot friends are on Earth trying to recover the All Spark. The all Spark gives life to any mechanical object. If Megatron gets his hands on it, he could raise an army that will destroy the Autobots, and the Earth for good. Sam is a young man who has become friends with the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. He helps them to fight against Megatron and his Decepticons.

This movie is my least favorite of the trilogy. Even so, it has great special effects, acting, screenplay, and soundtrack. The action and suspense are also quite good. There is also a lot of comedy, action, and a bit of drama. The thing I don't like about this movie is that it's mostly the main characters running around and trying to find a tomb. The story is a little weaker than the others. Despite these things, the movie is action packed. It has lots of battles, explosions, and comedy. It's still a pretty good movie. If you liked the 1st film, you will probably like this one.",1354320000,2,1173,4.559241706161138

3440805,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael Bay is known for making loud, expensive, visually arresting, utterly shallow films, but like so many directors his reputation is often a broad caricature than reality. Even Uwe Boll has made some decent films. But ""Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen"" is every awful thing about Bay rolled into one big dumb movie.

Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf) is at it again, after he discovers a piece of the Cube. He's off to college, so of course his pet Autobot Bumblebee is upset. So is his smoking hot girlfriend (smoking hot Megan Fox), who reluctantly agrees to keep up a long distance relationship. Because, you know, she has no other options and Sam is really funny.

Meanwhile, the Autobots are told to bug off by the U.S Military, who is tired of having all these robots blowing up exotic locations in blurry melees. So Optimus Prime agrees to leave humanity to its fate. This is a bad thing, of course, because Megatron has slunk off to his progenitor's planet to ask for reinforcement. This guy, who looks like an angry aborigine robot, is the titular Fallen mentioned in the title.

What ensues is a series of fights interspersed with broad and offensive stereotypes of robots with human-like traits. The worst are the two brothers who look and talk like urban punks, complete with gold buck teeth. Bay obviously thinks it's not offensive if ugly racial stereotypes are dressed up as robots.

But really, the most offensive thing about this film is that it exists. It's a blend of everything awful about big budget films, from the hot supporting actress who stands around stretching and sighing to robots speaking in slang to giant robot conflicts that are nigh-impossible to follow with the eye.

It all culminates with a death that's not a death since it lasts about twenty minutes, a contrived reason to make the miniscule humans relevant to the plot, and Megatron slinking away to fight again another day. I could characterize the film as a very expensive cartoon episode, but that would be an insult to the Transformer cartoons that started it all.

The first installment of Transformers was big, brash, and undeniably American, fetishizing our country's military might and love of big cars. But the second time around ""Revenge of the Fallen"" has nothing else to offer but more of the same.",1353283200,3,2303,4.83248730964467

3440811,3,B0019M5C0Q,Love the series and the all of the special effects are outstanding. The actors are first rate but the direction and writing for Sam in this movie are too painful to watch. I hope they are trying to target Kinder-gardeners and not just suffering from poor writing and direction. Way too schmaltzy to even eat popcorn to. If it wasn't for the special effects I would have given it NO STARS.,1348963200,,388,4.47887323943662
3440812,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The movie had great special effects; however, there were so many sexual innuendos that I found it offensive, especially since they really went after the younger market with this.  Had they kept it clean, it would have been much higher in my mind.",1347753600,,246,4.72093023255814
3440813,2,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie was over the top even for Michael Bay!  Reprising their roles from the first film, I found myself having to sit through a soap opera of Sam Witwicky's parents crying over their son leaving for college - at least until their kitchen utensils come to life!

Then we have Sam unable to say I love you to his air-headed, hot girlfriend, played vacuously by Megan Fox.  She looks great but hardly has any lines.  One of the robots said it well when he said she looks hot but is not that smart.

The little transformer truck robot is spying to the Decepticons.  It's obviously running around in her garage and no one notices?  The Autobots' rendition of slum kids with the Black ghetto accents will probably offend some viewers.

Besides the dropped ""coming of age"" storyline with the ridiculous antics of Sam's roommate and screaming girlfriend who just wants to have her first online date, we have a decent bit of history of the Optimus Prime's group, who deal with the red-tape of government - run by a lackey who gets his quite nicely I might add.

Action:  The movie forgets about a decent script and plot for some Rockem Sockem action with lots of alien robot fights.  Yes, lots of explosions - well, it is a Michael Bay film after all.

Bottom Line:  Outside of learning about the invasion of these `Bots and how they've been around us since the dawn of Time, and some incredibly impossible athletic actions by Sam, who almost dies in the attempt upon the deserts of Egypt, it's really not much of a film.  The first film was much better.

Rental.

I was unfortunately disappointed. There were many parts of the movie I just found to be unnecessary, certain characters they added I hated, and it failed in the humor it tried so hard to put in. The overall plot was pretty decent, although confusing. And the action was good, but not as good as the first movie. I'd say that, overall, this is a so-so film.",1341187200,2,520,4.371134020618556

The first one had more gravity to it as it was new and unexplored. This is a typical sequel that doesnt deliver quite as well as the first or especially the third. Its very entertaining which is likely what it was meant to be; Entertainment.

The movie gets 4 stars, but the reason I gave the product as a whole 5 stars is for the special features included in this edition. The special features which alone took FOREVER to explore completely (Good thing)make this a VERY worthy purchase. Worth every penny.

When I saw those in theaters, I was compelled to see them again. You just know when you like something like you know when you're hungry or in love. This one however, I did not get that feeling. I liked the action scenes. That was it. I felt the story was jumbled. The jokes were ill conceived and, as far as I'm concerned, over the top and over the line. I cringed. Shame. What happened? I'mnot a Michael Bay basher like many either. A great storyteller he is not, but this was bad. I like The Rock, Bad Boys, The Island and Armageddon. They're fun, adrenalized movies.

Shia what's-his-face did a pretty decent job, but the rest of the acting was subpar at best.  The entire college thing was dumb.  Huge over-the-top frat parties and tricked-out dorm rooms?

3440831,5,B0019M5C0Q,"If your looking for a Oscar caliber film, this isn't it. But if your looking for a fun entertaining time with, hot women, great action and special effects Transformers 2 is the movie for you.

Unlike the reviewers out there I knew what I was getting from this movie. I wasn't expecting wonderful acting or a great story. I was expecting a entertaining fun time and of course Megan Fox.

The Things I liked: 1. The chemistry between all the old actors from the first movie was great. You could tell they were having a good time filming the movie. You could tell by how good a acting job everyone did. I was surprised.

2. The action/special effects: The were both great. I'm glad they got the help of the military again for this movie it added to both the feel and action of the film. All the actors/stunt men did a great job.

Then there was ILM and their special effects of the action and Transformers was superb.

3. Megan Fox: Damn she is hot. What ever flaws this film had she did a great job of distracting me during the movie. I think I might have given this film 4 stars of less if it weren't for her.

The things I didn't like.

1. The Story: This was the worst part of the film. It just made almost no sense. Especially the part about there being a source of energon on Earth, but there was none, so what was the point of building the weapon on Earth when I'm sure they could have done it on any of the other planets.

2. The Transformers: The special effects were great, but there were just way to many characters. The only ones that had any impact for me was Optimas Prime, Bumble Bee, Soundwave(one of my favorite characters for the old show.), Star Scream, Megatron, and Jet Fire(Who I thought was a great character.), the rest were cannon fodder.

Overall: A really good movie worth seeing, but again this is a Michal Bay movie. They same guy who directed Bad Boys 1 and 2, Pearl Harbor, and Armageddon so don't expect a amazing story and great acting worthy of Oscars. Expect a fun time with a bad story, decent to good acting, and great action and special effects.",1331164800,10,2080,4.34020618556701

Between the Writers Strike and pressure to get this movie to audiences, it's no surprise this movie didn't live up to expectations. But those were BIG expectations. This movie is better than it is given credit for, and in blu-ray, even better.",1329782400,,304,4.545454545454546
3440834,1,B0019M5C0Q,"And this film is the biggest piece of evidence for that. I wasn't sure how he could possibly make a movie even worse than the original transformers, yet here it is. Plot holes big enough to fly the Starship Enterprise through, horrifically bad acting, robots that look like moving piles of random spare parts rather than anything resembling Transformers, and the action scenes just beat you over the head until your eyes bleed and your brain feels like oatmeal. There there are the blatantly racist robots. I'm not even sure what they were thinking by making them.
There are good action movies (Aliens, Die Hard), and then there are bad action movies (anything Michael Bay has ever directed).
This film is atrocious. The effects are so commonplace and omnipresent that they're not special, merely annoying and distracting, and by the end of it you're lucky if you don't have a splitting migraine. I'd rather watch almost anything else rather than suffer through this movie ever again. And for the record I've been a Transformers fan since 1984, and I find Bay's treatment of the franchise atrocious and insulting.",1329696000,4,1113,4.925531914893617
3440835,1,B0019M5C0Q,"To be clear and up front, I've seen most of this movie in small bits and pieces but I've never actually sat and watched it start to finish. After all, I'm only human and will stand for only a certain amount of torture.

What I do know is that this movie is total garbage. I understand this is not meant to contain any sort of symbolism or message or even artistry, but that doesn't mean it should be bereft of good acting, elementary writing, decent directing, intelligent editing  or any semblance of a plot. How come every time a robot transforms into something (which happens roughly a billion times) it just looks like they put a camera to a kaleidoscope and pressed record?

Early on some dude says, ""This is top secret so keep it quiet,"" before leading some military assault on a robot in hiding. Then two minutes later there's that robot plus two or three others destroying Shanghai. Way to keep things ""top secret."" This movie is filled with similar, asinine (visual and verbal) drivel.

There are popcorn movies like ""Independence Day"" or ""Armageddon"" where at least there are main characters with motives to drive the story forward. Then there are (thankfully few) movies like this that are just jumbled messes that should never be seen. There is a plethora of 5-star reviews for this movie; I'm just doing my part to drag down the rating since no one should have to watch this. Ever. It's bad even by Michael Bay standards.

This movie is loud, crass, vapid, and sophomoric, and represents everything that can go  horribly wrong when making a movie.",1329609600,4,1560,4.675182481751825

3440839,5,B0019M5C0Q,"This is the follow up to the great movie that came out in 2007. This continues the story, and adds a ton of more robots and action than the first movie had. It still has the amazing CG from the first film, but adds bigger and more detailed robots that were made for IMAX. This movie adds what the first one did great, and adds a ton of more it to the second film.

You have the great sound track from the movie and add some creepier Decepticon music to the film. The great main theme is still playing throughout the movie, and even the bring the rain theme is back in this film, but not as much. Explosion sound effects are even bigger than before, and the transformers have unique sounds to their weapons; which is a mix between bullet fire and electronic based weapon firing.

Graphics are just as amazing as the first movie was, but you also have gigantic transformers in this movie. Even if you have the larger than life transformers, you still feel like they fit in and don't seem like they are CGI at all. A few scenes have the entire area with CG only, and it's done so well I didn't even realize it until they tell you about them in the special features. The explosions are still just as great as the first, with even larger explosions in this movie.

The military actions are just like the first movie, and you can really tell they are coordinated professionally, with a ton of real life AC130's and Blackhawks to just name a few. It's really cool to see real life military tactics, with them doing their own thing and supporting the Autobots.

I personally don't think that the controversy surrounding the movie is true at all. You have these two brother Autobots that are accused of making fun of black people. I personally don't believe this because white people try and talk gangster out there, and you can't tell me that they could also be hillbillies instead of being black. Even in a race of super advanced robots you will have the lemons in the group, and I don't think its offensive to anyone, just humorous events.

Also this movie does have crude humor, and I really think it's funny. Some people have complained that this is a family movie and that they didn't expect to hear some of the humor when they brought their children to it. Ok, this movie is rated PG-13 and it clearly says crude humor on it, and I believe that is the parents responsibility if they think their child is ready for that or not, this is why it doesn't factor into my score.

The special features are great; I mean it's around three hours total of special features. They talk about the history of the transformers franchise, and so much more. It's pretty cool hearing about how they made the amazing robots in the film. Also on top of all the special features in the second disk, you have a full audio commentary with Michael Bay and the writers.

Overall I say you should buy this movie. This is how you should do a sequel: They took what made the first movie great, and made it even better.

3440840,2,B0019M5C0Q,"I have been a die-hard Transformers fan for 90% of my life! I loved the first movie, but this one..., hmmm....
What I liked about the movie:
1. The action was hardcore!
2. The basic plot was good!
3. They used a lot of interesting concepts from the different Transformers universes!
4. The soundtrack rocked!

What I didn't like:
1. Megan Fox served no purpose except for Sam's love interest!
2. Leo served no purpose except for comedic relief!
3. Too much sexual humor in the movie!
4. The visual effects were not that convincing a few times!
5. Devestator is suposed to be indestructible, and Mud-flap and Skids sould not have been able to 'bust-up' his face with ease! And
he got taken out by one shot from a giant rail gun?!?! Ehhhh....no!
6. Megatron is supposed to be the leader of the Decepticons, where did this Fallen character come from?!
7. Mud-flap and Skids look and act terrible!
8. I wish we had more insight to the new Autobots and Decepticons and where they came from! I the first movie we got to know the characters,
but in this movie some new characters were just thrown at us without back round info!

Overall this movie is a disappointment! I recommend it for fans who wanted to see hard-core action, but not recommended for everyone!
Especially not for kids!

Also, scenes with the boys pet dogs having sex, many sexual references to the female actress, and 2 ""urban"" transformer twins who kept cursing and fighting each other. I guess ""urban"" transformers love to curse and fight each other.

3440848,2,B0019M5C0Q,"This sequel is a film that both benefits and suffers from a complete disarray that reaches, literally, cosmic proportions.

Fueled by a surprisingly minimal number of sequences that exhibit exhilarating robot combat, Bay nonetheless succumbs to his own temptations and injects a conglomeration of worthless subplots and back story that are the sole culprits for an obnoxiously long running time.

In direct comparison to it's relatively fat-free sequel, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a cholesterol-ridden cacophony of disjointed elements that worked surprisingly well in its predecessor, albeit in efficiency and moderation.

That, unfortunately is put to the wayside in favor of an air of undeserved justification after the prequel's success upon Bay's part to explore whatever he wishes, even at the cost of what the audience desires most.

That said, despite crippling this blockbuster by establishing a series of exhausting and excessive plot foundations, Bay has, at least, paved the way for a subsequent finale film that will, hopefully, be lean and slick in it's comfort zones as it wraps up the pseudo trilogy.",1324166400,,1115,5.390804597701149

Sadly, ten minutes into the movie we were ready to turn Revenge of the Fallen off but gave it another 10 mins to see if it would get better.  It didn't, and it actually got worse.  It goes beyond juvenile.  You can bet we won't even bother wasting our time or money on Dark of the Moon.",1319932800,3,567,4.3619047619047615
3440858,1,B0019M5C0Q,"According to common wisdom, the plot of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is incomprehensible. Which is odd, as it actually seemed reasonably straightforward to me. Essentially it goes like this:

Thousands of years ago - and apparently without anyone noticing - the Decepticons placed a device inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that can blow up the Sun and harvest it for energon, which they can use to fuel themselves and possibly restore their dying homeworld of Cybertron. The Fallen - the Decepticons' supreme commander, senior even to Megatron - wants to activate the device, but he fears setting foot on Earth due to the threat posed by Optimus Prime (apparently only 'a Prime' can kill him). Also, the device's starting key, the 'Matrix of Leadership', has been missing for millennia. The Autobots and their human allies end up getting involved in the Decepticon plan to find the key and start the machine and the whole matter is resolved in a string of unlikely plot coincidences and stupendous explosions (spoiler: the good guys win).

What confuses the matter is Michael Bay's total inability to selectively self-edit. The problem with Revenge of the Fallen - aside from those inherent to the franchise established in the opening movie which it is far too late to do anything about - isn't that the ingredients are wrong or that you couldn't make an entertaining movie with them, but that Bay and the writers throw every single half-baked idea they have into the mix, regardless of whether it makes sense or if they have the screentime to do it justice. In isolation, ideas like Devastator (a massive robot made up of seven lesser ones), the Pretender (a Terminator-esque Decepticon assassin that can pass as human) or Jetfire (an elderly Decepticon who switched sides to join the Autobots, got bored with the war and has spent decades disguised as an exhibit in the Smithsonian) could have made for interesting scenes or story points. Thrown on top of one another, they decohere the story and make it increasingly hard work to follow what's going on amidst the ridiculous number of fireballs being hurled around.

Matters aren't helped by the human cast: Shia LeBouf was blandly inoffensive in the first movie, but doesn't have the acting chops to sell Sam Witwicky's plot-inspired descent into temporary insanity, which reduces the middle third of the movie into barely-bearable tedium, though things are briefly livened up by the arrival of the Pretender assassin, a cool idea which is underdeveloped. In fact, most of the human performances are uninspired and uninteresting. There's also a bizarre lack of emotional response to events in the film. At one point a US aircraft carrier is destroyed and sinks, taking with it thousands of lives and an appreciable fraction of the USA's military power, but this garners almost no response whatsoever from anyone. No-one seems to be particularly concerned about the partial destruction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, either.

The Transformers themselves also suffer from the problems of plot overload. Compared to the dozen or so in the first movie, there are about forty in the second, and very few have any development or interesting character traits. Those that do get more screentime tend to be lazily-written and based on human racial stereotypes and caricatures which are inappropriate and moronic. Still, from the carnage Jetfire emerges as a more interesting character that not enough is done with, whilst Optimus Prime and Bumblebee develop well over their roles in the first movie. Indeed, Peter Cullen's dignified voice performance does seem to have come in from a completely different and considerably better film altogether. The Decepticons are mostly lacking in any kind of development whatsoever with the Fallen being a colossal disappointment and Devastator being a let-down after an impressive first appearance. The film's lack of memorable villains is a key problem (though hardly the greatest in the picture).

What really damages the film beyond all possible repair, however, is its severe pacing problem. The climactic battle sequence in the Egyptian desert (written by someone who's never looked at a map of the Middle East, but let's not go there) goes on for far too long, eating away at screentime that could have been better-used earlier in the movie to flesh out more interesting concepts and ideas, or simply could have been removed: two and a half hours is probably way too long for a brainless popcorn action movie in the first place.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (*) is a spectacular failure of a movie, being incoherent, badly-paced, badly-acted and ill-conceived. The special effects are genuinely impressive and there are glimpses of concepts that could have made for a great film, but these are left underdeveloped in favour of atrocious attempts at comedy or pathos. It's certainly not the worst movie of all time, as some have labelled it, and it's almost worth watching as a masterclass in how not to make a big-budget action film. A tremendous let-down considering some promising ideas and also the inoffensively entertaining first movie in the franchise.",1319328000,3,5161,5.087367178276269

The one thing that always irks me though is how far they deviated with many of the classic characters.  For instance with Bumble Bee being a sports car instead of a Volkswagen Bug, Megatron not looking anything like the original, etc.  Things like that bother me greatly but I try to overlook them to enjoy the movie as it is and they do a good job.

3440868,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The thing is a mess. Sure the action is still killer, no filler. The problem is the 1st Transformers was done with a wink-in-the-eye sense of humor. This one has almost zero humor in it and any attempts at it are lame. I just didn't get why they had two jive talkin' transformers. Is this the 1970s?

The whole premise seems flimsy. The US has some heavily secured facilities yet they are so easy to break into despite the fact they now know the evil Transformer decepticon robots exist. Then deaths here are cartoonish (OK, the series comes from a cartoon but it's still dumb).

Also, explain to me how the mom and dad end up in Egypt. I still don't get how in the middle of some massive battle they just pop up when we last saw them maybe an hour ago in Paris.

Also, the thing they are chasing or whatever is called the ""matrix."" Wow, how original! Name it after another hit sci-fi movie. Maybe it's all part of the comic book/cartoon series but I had to laugh at that. Also, laughable is this super evil decepticon is called ""the Fallen."" Really? That's the coolest name you could come up with with religious overtones?

When you read the title, I expected ""the Fallen"" to stand for a group of decepticons. Nope. It stands for the big cheese decepticon. Dumb.

Anyway, it's not like this movie is bad for what it is, it's just not as mindblowing as the 1st one.

I just listed off a number of movies that have spectacle and explosions and action and also manage to not forgo competent writing, storytelling, characterization and coherency. Keep them in mind as you read my review. You could make an argument for each one qualifying as a popcorn movie. I bring these movies up to highlight that just because a popcorn movie is a popcorn movie, that doesn't excuse it for being completely terrible in every way.

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is completely terrible in every way. Objectively speaking.

RotF displays a shocking disregard for storytelling, in that there is no story. Almost every scene in the movie has nothing to do with the scene before or after it. If the plot of the Decepticons from the beginning was to sap the energy from the sun, why did it take over two hours of the ridiculously long run time for that to factor into anything? Why was so much time spent with Shia's parents? Why is the army involved at all? Robot heaven wtf? The movie was ""written"" during the writer's strike, meaning Michael Bay did most of the script work. I'm pretty sure he came up with a bunch of ideas that he thought were cool for a Transformers sequel and threw them all in without bothering to tie them together at all. The movie feels like it's making it up as it goes along, probably because it is.

As for the characters, there are none. No character in this movie has an arc, no one changes at all. If there is an ""emotional core"" to this movie, it's that Shia Lebeouf is struggling to tell Megan Fox that he loves her. This might be an interesting premise in the hands of a good director, but in the hands of Michael Pearl Harbor Bay, it's utter garbage. I'd be shocked if anyone cares at all about Shia's and Megan's relationship in this movie, because there's nothing to care about. Also, pretty much every character in this movie is the comic relief. Shia's parents are comic relief. The racist robots are comic relief. Poor John Turturro is comic relief. Maybe this would be fine if any of it was even close to being funny, but it's not. It's all juvenile, offensive, painfully unfunny jokes. I've seen funnier canceled CBS sitcoms.

Digging a little deeper, there is nothing to dig deeper into this movie. There's no overarching theme. There's no subtext to chew on. Everything is on the surface in RotF. Much like a lot of canceled CBS sitcoms.

Ahh, but who cares about all of that! What about the ACTION and the EXPLOSIONS and the ROBOT ON ROBOT FIGHTING?! I'll again point out my list of movies above as a reminder that there are loads of movies that give us both good storytelling/writing/acting/characters and action, but I'll carry on because the action in RotF sucks as well. The action in RotF is technically impressive, I guess. The quality of the special effects is high. However, that is not the same thing as effective special effects. Sure, you get robots fighting each other, but there's no reason to care about any of it. There's no weight to anything. It's just a bunch of stuff that's happening. I see no difference between the action scenes in RotF and a montage on YouTube of NASCAR smash ups. Compare any action scene in this movie to the T-Rex fight scene in Peter Jackson's King Kong. While that movie certainly isn't perfect, that action scene is pretty darn good. In it, you know who the participants are, you know what's going on, and you know what's at stake. There is no action scene in RotF that accomplishes any of those things, especially at establishing stakes.

To conclude, this movie is an objective failure in every way. I am beyond sick of defenders telling me to turn my brain off and enjoy it. There's nothing to enjoy. I don't understand why people accept this trash when there are so many movies that have the spectacle and are also simply good movies. Raise your standards.",1310774400,5,4106,4.655172413793103
3440875,1,B0019M5C0Q,"OK. When I saw the video at the library, I thought why not. I used to watched the cartoon years back.

Having missed the first Transformer Film, I might have been at a lost here, but really, I was mostly bored. Yah, the CGI was cool, but that was that.

The movie was way too long for a non-character driven action flick. This was not Lord of the Rings, people.

Beside for the obvious car ad all the way through...I felt the extra hour tacked on this movie was a commercial to join the US Marines and Military.

What was with all of the random shots of airplanes and troops and aircraft carriers...

There were so many of these non sequitur military shots, I forget I was watching a movie about robot cars/trucks/planes/kitchen gadgets, and thought I was watching the biggest product placement deal every between the producers and the US military.

OK. We know that the demographic for this film are probably 13-25 year old boys/men, and the Military wants ion on that action, but the US MIlitary push of the film including the films ""believe in yourself theme"" that seems to mirrors the Marine corps motto was over the top.

3440881,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Going into this film I knew the reputation that Michael Bay had built himself. He is the guru of special effects, quick cut editing, fast camera work and none the less product placement. The first Transformers movie left a bad taste in my mouth. First of all it was called Transformers but the movie was NOT about the Transformers. It was about Sam and his sexually broad girl friend Mikayla. The Autobots and Decepticons were used as secondary elements for the film. Hardly any information was gained about them but there was a battle brewing evolving into an epic war. Then, there was the use of the military which ever seemed pointless but at the same it did make sense to have them involved. With all those guns a blazing how could they not? The problem with those characters they weren't engaging either. The whole adventure I was stuck with people I didn't remotely care about. Now the first movie has been summarized in a nut shell onto the 2nd installation.

The 2nd installation is pretty much the same as the first movie. We have characters that are not engaging, use a physically attractive female to bring more hormonal males into the theater who is cold as ice, more explosions, more action sequences and more screen time for the visual effects. What did I leave out? Oh, story and plot how silly of me. What story? What plot? This movie was quite unclear with the direction it wanted to take. The subtitle of the movie states: Revenge of The Fallen. The title should apply throughout the whole film not the first twenty through thirty minutes of the movie, if you've seen the movie you'll understand what I am talking about. Let's use ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as an example. The title of the movie gives the viewers an idea of what the outcome of the movie should be about. In that movie audience gained more respect and love for Han Solo who was sacrificed to be part of a scientific experiment. That moment was a gut wrenching, to see a smuggler gone good and get taken away from us, yeah. Luke learns the true identity of his father, the rebels get a beat down, and when you think the good guys have the upper hand they don't. All this information was new, but nothing was new in ""Revenge of The Fallen"". The only time new information was gained is when that Decepticon attached itself to the satellite and sent out a message. That was it. The title itself is misleading too. I had no idea that the Fallen was an actual character. I thought it meant the Decepticons were going to deliver an over all punishment to the good guys. Ugh.

What else is there to talk about? I mean the CGI was there, it looked pretty, it looked real, the bots were animated nicely that was it. Optimus Prime didn't wuss out and actually lived up to his name. The two ""Jar-Jar Bink"" Autobots are EXTREMELY annoying. I thought they were a Quasimodo Autobot wannabe gangsters or gangstas, whichever word you choose. The introduction of the numerous Autobots and Decepticons were over bearing, it was a big CGI F*** fest. I hardly knew anybody was but yet I am suppose to either root for them or boo them off. It wasn't great because they seemed to be interesting but no depth was given to them. I don't know why, but they weren't. How could I forget, Sam meeting the primes, lol. Talk about ""jumping the shark"". To end this paragraph I quote James Rocchi from Special to MSN Movies he and I seem to have the same feeling towards this film, ""If you tell me you loved 'Revenge of the Fallen' -- really, truly, loved it without reservation or complaint -- then you've essentially told me you can't tell something from nothing, good from bad, craft from cost."" Yeah that's how I feel.

In addition you may have noticed the title of my review seems unfitting, but fitting it is. The guy that I work with had mentioned his 10 year old niece had seen this movie. He too didn't care for it but it was entertaining to him. But when he asked her what she thought of the movie I about fell out of my chair and I quote the unnamed girl ""I think they used up their imagination after the first movie."" Indeed they did.",1304380800,5,4097,4.474598930481283
3440882,4,B0019M5C0Q,"I hear a lot of flack against this movie.  So many people complain about sequels these days.  Of course the second one is never as good as the first.  When you see the first movie of a series, everything is new and exciting, the characters are larger than life and its everything and more than you expected because you never expected it.  For god's sakes, the movie was created from cartoon characters. If you watch the old shows, the plotlines of the ""Transformers"" cartoon were cheesy, the animation was sub-par and the action was canned; And we loved every bit of it.  The fact is; the show was about robots from another planet that can change into ordinary vehicles fight other robots that can change into other vehicles.  There was no real story, that's not why we loved the ""transformers"".  We loved them because they were cool.  The movie is just that. ""Cool""  Micheal Bay didn't set out to solve world dilemmas with this movie.  His focus was not to create a love story that trumps ""The Notebook"" or a robot version of ""Willy"".  No, he set out to make movie of a cartoon of robot that fight other robots and that's what he did and he did it larger than life.  This is not the Green Mile, or the Shawshank Redemption.  And all the trendy sheep who insult this movie and pick it apart just to make themselves sound smart have no concept of action films for the sake of action.  If you loved the cartoon, go see the movie.  If you didn't, then don't.  Simple as that.",1303948800,3,1472,4.41635687732342
3440883,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the sequel to the original Transformers made in 2007.  The second Transformers was good, but not as good as the original.  Not really surprising, as most of the time the original is the best.  But I still would recommend Revenge of the Fallen to lovers of the first.  All your favorite characters are back and some new ones.  The new characters are mainly autobots and decepticons, while they do add their touch, they don't change anything dramatically.  You also visit some new locations like Egypt, so that changes it up a bit.

The plot is similar to the first.  The decepticons are trying to kill the humans and take over earth and the autobots are trying to stop them.  It is different enough to make it interesting but isn't anything amazing.  The action scenes are stepped up a notch.  This means more explosions, more fist fights, and more shooting missiles.  As mentioned before, there are more robots.  Sometimes there are so many that it's hard to keep track of who's who.  But it's not a big deal as you can figure it out pretty easily when you see who's fighting who.

There's also the same type of humor as in the first Transformers.  It's not gut splitting, but it deserves a few chuckles.  Overall, it's not an excellent movie and doesn't try to be too serious.  But it's still a good movie and worth watching for some afternoon laughs and action.  Check it out if you liked the first one.",1303862400,2,1444,4.5703125
3440884,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Let face it Michael Bay has made Transformers his own, which for a longtime Transformers geek, I can't say that is always a good thing.  If we're all honest with ourselves we know that the childhood cartoon that we loved so much isn't that great either, but for me Transformers will always be special and thats why I will watch this film and however many sequels or prequels follow it.  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a example of excess, Bay seemed to think that more is better.  More action, more transformers, more explosions, more spinning camera shots into the sun, but this doesn't add up to more story or even stronger story.  The film is 150 mins of noise and action which by the end it starts to wear thin.  The Big Scree Edition is only adding to the excess, with some of the action sequences in a larger format.  This larger format isn't anything to get too excited or worry about, I was watching for the switch in formats and it didn't seem jarring or odd, nor did it enhance my movie experience.

3440887,4,B0019M5C0Q,"I keep seeing how everyone seems to dislike this movie. But it wasn't all that bad. I mean sure there are some uncomfortable parts in the movie where you wonder why they had it in there. Or parts where they could have done it better and or differently. Though, knowing the fact that the writers strike did not help the movie, and Michael Bay, at all plays a big part. As he said he was ""walking on to the set with no script."" And knowing that they did not finish the movie until a couple of hours before the world premire. Talk about cutting it close! Now really think about it, if you were in this same situation as Michael Bay, how would the movie turn out? I think Michael did a good job!

 The movie has it's good and suprising moments like, for example, the forest battle. I know I was cheering on Optimus and was happy he was kicking butt and then the suprise came. I remember my mouth dropped. The story between Optimus and Sam and is actually interesting. It makes you think if you were in Sam's shoes what would you decide on. Me, personally, would go and help Optimus but some may think other wise. Another touching part is where Sam and the gang were in the tomb of the primes and were the matrix turned into dust knowing that it was the only way to bring back Optimus to life.

I know some people out there are confused on why the fallen wanted to destroy the Earth's sun. Simple, he used the machine to drain the sun for it's energy in order to convert it to energon so then they can create more lives. They do explain it in the movie.

All in all I think if you give another chance you would see it differently. I know it happened to me. I, too, did not like this movie compared to the first, but after finding out the ""behind the scenes"" details and watching it again, it's actually an entertaining movie.",1301788800,3,1820,4.236311239193084

Sam however has one of the last remaining pieces of the all-spark then something goes haywire went it's powers go into his brain making him a bit smarter, more frantic and fast paced like never before like if he had a rush of some kind especially writing weird transformers type languages on paper and some kind of supernatural ability. An ancient Decepticon named ""The Fallen"" (Voiced by Tony Todd) has arrived on Earth seeking revenge but while he's at it, Sam has became a target for Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving) and other decepticons must seek an ancient device hidden in Egypt that can unleash doom into the world.

Co-starring Megan Fox back as Mikaela, Isobel Lucas, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel this is a very entertaining and well paced sequel that is actually four stars. Sure some of the jokes are crude yet tasteless and weak at times including former Decepticon Jetfire (Voiced by Mark Jones) being one of those old-man jokes to even humping stuff but there is a few good hilarious moments. The acting is quite good, the action sequences are breathtaking as usual from Michael Bay as they are better than the first and amazing CGI even thought ""Avatar"" has the best visual effects of 2009. We get more Transformers such as Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Soundwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), and Skipjack (Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and sometimes it's a bit racist with those 2 robots being punk-hip hop stereotypes even goofy looking but annoying at times.

It  was  a  late  Monday  afternoon  like  around  6:00  pm  and  the  sun  was  still  out. My  parents  were  out  of  town  that  evening  and  I  did  not  have  to  work  the  next  day. So  I  decided  to  see  a  movie  that  night. The  movie  I  wanted  to  see  that  night  was  Transformers  2. Insted  of  seeing  it  at  regular movie  theather. I  decided  to  see  this  at  a  drive  inn  movie  theather,  because  I  thought  it  would  be  more  fun  and  worth  it. So  I  grabed  my  pillow  off  my  bed  and  some  snacks, and  my  public  enemies book  to  read  until the  movie  started  and  was  on  my  way  to  the  drive  inn.

I  do  drive  a  2003  Chevy  red  tracker. I  was  also  parked  in  the  front  row  infront  of  the  screen  and  in  the  middle  of  the  role.

3440896,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Not impressed with this second Transformers movie.

Too many sexual jokes that just were not funny, too much screen time of ""The Twins"" and not enough of Optimus Prime. (The only reason to see a Transformers film)

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen brings back the characters from the first movie:

Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky
Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes
Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox
John Turturro as Agent Simmons

And John Leguizamo wannabe Ramon Rodriguez as Leo Spitz.

I've already mentioned the sexual jokes that had no purpose in this film. They weren't funny and were totally inappropriate.

The lack of Optimus Prime (no spoilers): he isn't in this film very much. BIG, HUGE mistake Mr Bay and your writers. And instead you fill that time with two minor autobots who try to be funny (think Jar Jar Binks).

The action sequences were better. I could follow who was fighting whom. And the explosions - I liked the nice big one at the end - were nice eye-candy.

But the story was the best they could do considering the Writer's Strike of last year. With all the new robots, it's hard to create a character-driven story like the last one (what am I saying?!?!?!).

You can definitely tell how Michael Bay feels about President Obama and his foreign policy. The jabs given are aimed at liberals and those who aren't too keen on the U.S. military. Speaking of the military, they really get to shine and explode in this film as they do most Michael Bay films.

Even though it's raking in the big bucks (think Spider-Man 3), people will remember this sequel as another poor attempt at milking a franchise. And it's only the second film!

This film may even fail to be picked up and added to my DVD collection (A true sign of lameness). Let's hope Transformers 3 will be the final film.",1294099200,,1789,4.61198738170347

3440899,1,B0019M5C0Q,"First of all, though I am the right age to have seen the original Transformer cartoons, I never did watch them, so I don't come into the new franchise with any expectations of how it ""should be"".  I actually enjoyed the first movie, maybe because I didn't expect much, yet it entertained me and kept my attention.  I even bought that first movie on DVD and enjoyed watching it a couple of times.  The effects were impressive even if the plot did not represent the more intelligent side of science fiction.

OK, now on to the sequel.  Wow.  I was watching it for free for the first time, more than a year after the theatrical release.  I put it off for so long because I had heard that it was not as ""good"" as the first.  That was an understatement.  I did not make it through the entire movie.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I gave up once a little decepticon robot started humping the leading lady's leg while it admitted it never wanted to be a decepticon anyway.  How does that make sense anatomically?  Well, if you take everything that came before that point, I guess that scene fits right in.  I'd already been subjected to watching real dogs humping one another, and a horrible super-model type college girl trying to get busy with the leading man, just to find out she was really a robot with a robo-tongue.  And...um...speaking of which, that super-model robot lady can blow the crap out of various campus buildings, but can't beat one kid in a dorm room?  Anyway...all I'm saying is, it was not just one offense that caused me to pick up the remote and turn this piece of sci-fi crap off...it was an entire series of offenses.  There is one moment when the main character is about to have his head split open and brain removed because his mind holds robo-secrets.  I think that was symbolic of what was being done to viewers like me.

Yep, my brain hurt while I was watching.  Even the stuff that would have at least registered on the ""cool"" scale in terms of special effects were so horribly edited (or programmed?) that I couldn't tell what was going on.  I get it...robots were fighting!  But I couldn't see anything-- just metal flashing around with different angles coming in so fast that I never got the entire picture.  The giant robot baddy that rolled through Tokyo in the beginning looked kinda like it might have been cool, but I never got a real look at the darn thing! Plus, I couldn't tell one decepticon from another-- I just know that the bad robots all had gruff, ""evil"" voices, as apposed to the good guys robots who talked...well...um...jive?  OK. It is hard to put into words.  And obviously it was just as hard for the makers of the movie to put this transformers concept into words, so they just threw as much CGI and over-the-top potty humor at the viewers as they could, hoping that the money would come flowing in, and it probably did, which is the biggest tragedy of all.",1293321600,,2911,4.478178368121442

Wow.  To say that this movie is disappointing is like saying that Starscream is only slightly a backstabber.  Michael Bay completely throws plot out the window, and strings together one cheap thrill after another.  Every single scene seems designed to provoke a ""wow"" reaction from the audience.  Whether through action, absurd situations, or plot twists, the movie is meant to be a thrill ride.  Too bad the type of ""wow"" evoked is often a ""how on earth did you ever think this scene would be a good idea??!!!"" type of ""wow.""  The characters are virtually unrecognizable, it's hard to identify which robots are actually decepticons or autobots in the large scale fight scenes.  There are numerous cop outs and plot holes throughout, and overall this movie is like a roller coaster with no end, and no tracks.

Imagine yourself standing in line for a roller coaster, getting on board, strapping in, and then being hurtled through space at ridiculous velocities.  The first drop is fun, the second okay, the third is a little soon, the fourth is much farther and sooner then expected, by the time we get to the sixth or seventh drop you are wondering what the heck is going on, does this ride ever end, or God forbid, make sense?  Rest assured, this ride is going nowhere, as there is no destination, no sense, no reason at all to the ride.  All of that has been thrown out to guarantee more and larger drops.  And if it makes you want to throw up from disgust, then please do so quickly and let the next person get on board.

After watching this movie I badly needed to shower to cleanse from my soul the horror that I had just witnessed.  My brother and I pulled out many of our classic transformers toys just so we could remember that once upon a time the Transformers brand was actually an exciting and imaginative part of our lives.  I prefer to think that this movie never happened, but unfortunately they are now making a third chapter.  Michael Bay and company have a looooong way to go to redeem themselves after the horror that was Transformers 2.  The movie made a lot of money, which makes little sense, but it assures us that there will be future movies.  My prediction is that Transformers 3 will bomb, much like Batman and Robin did back in the day.  I want Transformers to succeed, but this is not the Transformers that I know and love.  This is the bizarre long lost cousin of Transformers who was sent away to undergo bizarre experiments, only to return more horrific and ugly than before.  Pay him no mind, hopefully he'll go away.",1289347200,2,2867,4.50968992248062
3440905,1,B0019M5C0Q,"What killed this movie were its characters and lack of development. Everyone and their situations felt like shallow cliches.

- The whole college/girlfriend thing with Sam Witwicky felt like a sitcom. A soulless, generic copy of ""boy going to college w/girlfriend back home scenes you've seen a thousand times.

- The transformers look just...like big, stainless steel refrigerators run amuck. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell's going on with 'em. The director kept using this circular, revolving camera every time they were on screen, adding to the confusion. Because of this, you really have no attachment to them at all. They're too big, too confusing, and too ridiculous looking. I just wish someone would've unplugged 'em and called it a day.

- The black stereotyped transformers were just garbage. It was embarrassing to hear them talk. It's as if the writers were saying ""yeah, let's add some jive-talkin', hip-hop bots and we'll make a funny. yeah.."" No, it wasn't funny. They were stupid, pointless, and embarrassing.

This movie was terrible. I couldn't watch the whole thing. I jumped ship when Sam and his college buddy were in the old junkyard with the hip-hop bots.

3440906,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.

So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline ""Revenge is coming"" reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.

The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.

In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: ""This movie is not about acting."" And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.

This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.

With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.

If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?",1288656000,,3765,4.52129221732746

Why do they even bother hiring her to be part of their films?  Also, the lighting made everyone seem tan all the time.  Did everyone go to a tanning spa before filming or what?

The animators are simply brilliant and are capable of creating their wares in the full view of the sun. This is a bold step that must be appreciated.

What is a ""people-pleaser"" film?  This lost movie is called Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen, a movie in which so much ""filler"" was forced into the movie that it turned out as a complete jumble of flawed ideas and useless concepts.  This clearly could not live up to its predecessor's name.
 Not a single category can hold, or even want to hold Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in its ranks.  The movie has everything; action, comedy, sci-fi, romance, adventure, and drama.  A viewer's dream, right?  The answer is no.  Bay used concepts in this film were simply spinoffs of the original, with other unexplained ideas thrown in the bunch.  The movie did not follow the main theme through as the original did, rather straying off into other ideas that would leave a viewer wondering, ""Wait, what just happened?""  Short bursts of rushed action with the amount of camera movement that gives a person a headache were placed in the film as if the idea was just to make a few people happy.  Michael Bay placed so much emphasis on the comical aspect of the film that it was hard to even take seriously.  Romance was clearly flawed, considering the reason romance was even a part of this film was to add in a few unnecessary ideas, like a female decepticon who somehow knew all there is to know about college life, and a hot girlfriend (Meagan Fox) who had absolutely nothing to do with the entire movie.  Drama had its few shining moments, but then completely disappeared in the next horrifying scene.  On top of this complete genre mess, a flawed plotline just puts the icing on the cake.
 In Transformers, the plot was concrete; giant bots came looking for a certain item to turn the tide in an epic war, one side for keeping humans safe, the other side not really caring whatsoever.  There were no actual unexplained incidents.  In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, however, the plot was like thawing ice on a lake; one wrong step and one is submerged in the coldest experience ever.  To get wrapped up in any one idea besides the plot in the movie would cause a person to completely get lost with whatever was going on.  Stories went on and on until one finally understood that ""wow, this one is crap"".
 The movie starts off with a narrative, telling you of an ancient group of transformers called the ""Dynasty of the Prime"", Prime for short, and their goal of using a type of machine called a Sun Harvester, a device used to drain the energy from any solar system's sun in order to power the All-Spark back on Cybertron.  They all agreed to leave life bearing planets alone; all except one of the Primes.  This one inherited the name ""Fallen"" for his belief that no other life-forms could amount to the Transformers.  He constructed a Sun Harvester on Earth and became the true first Decepticon, slaughtering humans whom found out about this device.  The other Primes fought and imprisoned him, however, before he could activate the Sun Harvester, and sealed the key away with their own bodies.
The Fallen swore to take revenge on the humans, vowing to destroy them when he returns.  The rest goes downhill from there, as Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) is shoved once again into the middle of this now ""old grudge match"" between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), and the Decepticons, now led by the Fallen.  Sam must maneuver his way through the countless trials throughout the film, from exploding missiles to a female trying to extract his brain.
Transformers:  Revenge of the Fallen stayed true to its name; it had ""fallen"".  Bay most likely rushed this film just to make a few people happy.  Potential could have been brought out had patience and meticulous proofreading were made.  Only Meagan Fox's body over a motorcycle and its $800 million it made were the only good things that came out this film, and even those were because the first one was so good.
Movie not recommended.

3440926,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Forgive this departure. There are enough trenchant opinions of the film that mine will ring hollow. Briefly, I enjoyed this silly, overproduced, over the edge and at times over the limits film. I liked it in much the same way I enjoyed that Matthew Broderick version of ""Godzilla"" - there was nothing that stood in the way of just letting the thing be what it was. I found the first one, thin story notwithstanding, to be most enjoyable, and the effects shots to be some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen. I stared at a 37"" screen in a Sam's Club, having had no intention of seeing ""Transformers,"" with tears in my eyes at the lyrical beauty and depth of the visual effects. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a lesser film in that respect: the editing was so frenetic at times that one didn't have a chance to really study the beauty of the shots (I guess that's what slo-mo is for). But it was a good-natured film, and John Turturro's burlesque turn was worth the price of admission, especially if you knew his Pacino-esque interp in the first film. Suffice it to say I found it a fun romp with plenty of room for popcorn.

What I can't understand is this subculture of reviewers who seemingly take near-ecstatic joy in tearing a film to shreds. I see it all the time with Shyamalan films, which I invariably enjoy for their metaphoric content and soft poetry. Roger Ebert called the effects in ""The Last Airbender"" ""atrocious."" What an outrageous statement; they were groundbreaking and gorgeous. An article in Computer Graphics World magazine was mindblowing in describing how things were done, but before that I found the work with the elements to be beautiful, convincing, properly stylized, operatic, and visually uplifting. Yet all Night Shyamalan has to do is make a movie and people are lined up around the block to parade their critical faculties and prowess of the pen, lambasting it within an inch of its life.

We're all entitled to our opinions, of course, and a forum of this type exists to provide the opportunity to share them. But when I see the near Industrial Revolution energy brought to the task of excoriating what is, after all, merely a fun, popcorn movie, I am bemused to say the least. It's a Michael Bay! If you don't know by now what that means, do more research! :) It's like the people who called the hideous ""Doctor"" Laura Schlessinger in a time of great emotional need, expecting therapy, and getting skinned alive. For a time, I felt sorry for them, but that passed. They knew who and what she was before they called, after all. If you intend to see (much less buy) ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" make sure you like wildly overdone action, can briefly eschew subtle characterization, and don't mind just having a good time - even if that good time is laughing your fanny off at a film that you don't relate to.

Shai La Dousche again demonstraits his inability to act throughout the entire film,Megan Fox just poses slutty, looks cute into the camera and says a few lines here and there and well...the only thing Michael Bay can deliver  are fancifal CGI effects on a ginormous budget, large explosions and little to no plot.

This film's script was written so badly, that they turned to creating(or re-introducing) Autobot characters that are ghetto and illiterate and that was suppose to be funny and entertaining. Lets also not forget ""Sam's"" butt raping chiwawa Mojo and Deceptcons with four letter vocabulary. Is that really what people want their kids to see and hear?Combine all of this with CG effects that just become convoluted and run together after a while. Virtually every scene has been computer enhanced or manipulated,largely with CG.Borring.

There is nothing memorible about this film other than to recall how bad it truely was. Years ago, George Lucas said in an interviw that ""Special effects aren't the story,the story is the story,"" and he was right in saying so. Who would have ever thought that he would be going back his word(his own advice) and creating three god awful prequels and for other directors (such as Michael Bay) to in turn take that ill,pre-conceived idea and make films as bad, if not worse like Transformers 2?

But I'll say one thing most of the others didn't. The worst things about this movie were:

1. Michael Bay
2. Roberto Orci
3. Alex Kurtzman
4. Ehren Kruger

You can't have a good movie without a good director and a good script. And both were, as others put it, an epic fail in this case. I blame the writers as well as the director, though the director gets a bigger share. All should have been fired before the movie even started filming. For why, see the first Transformers film they made. The only excuse executives have for keeping them on is the money the first film made. Unfortunately, they're looking at the dollar signs from the second as justification for keeping Mr. Bay employed. They failed to notice that a huge number of people who watched the first film hated it so much that there is little chance the third will be as successful. I can only hope it bombs so bad they'll be forced to let someone else take over the movie franchise.

There are a fair number of capable actors in the film. But none of them were put to good use. Even Peter Cullen had to utter some horrible lines like, ""Give me your face"" and other such nonsense. He made it sound as good as it could, but it still sounds stupid.

As far as the visuals are concerned, they were totally inconsistent with even the first film, nevermind the premise of Transformers. In the first film, a robot did not constantly have little pieces flying off whenever it got hit. In this one, the slightest touch and pieces of CG metal and glass went everywhere. Because of this, while in the first film the robots appeared powerful and untouchable, in the second they looked like flimsy science projects gone wrong, then put through a blender. So, despite the enormous budget, even the special effects were enormously disappointing--and that's compared to the first, which already lowered the standards so far I wasn't expecting to get much out of the robot action scenes.

Since everyone else is commenting on it, I'll just say characters like Megan Fox's and Isabel Lucas's are so unimportant that their inclusion is nothing more than yet another tasteless departure from good moviemaking. I have nothing against the actresses, but their part essentially amounted to a few shots of a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue being spliced into an bad student film. It's just another annoying distraction that has nothing to do with what made the original Transformers characters and stories great.

As an aside, at least if you purchased the Bumblebee transforming case edition, you got a transformable case out of it. But for the disc itself, I recommend using it as a drink coaster. (A guest can use the special features disc for their drink.) You'll get much more enjoyment out of it that way.",1279152000,2,2942,4.667953667953668

Revenge of the Fallen is an abrasive, ugly, racist, offensive, awful excuse for a movie. It's a giant advertisement for god knows what that's full of explosions and the sound of clanging metal.

3440942,2,B0019M5C0Q,"It amazes me when the powers that be manage to screw up so badly on what should have been a good movie. I mean, the first one was great but this just didn't do anything for me.

The story (if you can call it that) was so convoluted it made it almost impossible to follow and enjoy the movie at all. The humor? Most of it was vulgar and completely unneeded. I was actually embarrassed to be watching it and feared for the fate of humanity when the audience I was watching it with were laughing. The only enjoyable parts of the movie were the Transformers and Bay even screwed them up. Two names: Mudflap and Skids. Ugh, I rooted for the new bots to die, they were that annoying. I stand by LaBeouf and Fox who did what they could with the characters, even if everyone knows Fox is just there as eye candy.

While I fell in love with the first Transformers, there's no denying that Tranformers: Revenge of the Fallen is just plain ghastly. While the movie is pretty to look at, the bad far outweighs the good in Michael Bay's latest special effects epic.",1278460800,2,1052,4.308080808080808

3440944,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I thought the first Transformers movie had too many distracting human characters and didn't focus enough on the actual Transformers (sometimes literally -- it was hard to see what was going on in the action sequences), but at least it was an enjoyable enough popcorn movie.  This one takes everything I didn't like about the first movie and amplifies it, and then drops everything I enjoyed until the last ten minutes or so.

The cast of characters in this movie is pretty much everyone you ever hated in high school, plus Optimus Prime, and then Jar Jar Binks times three.  I'm serious; there are at least THREE characters in this movie who are basically Jar Jar clones: extremely irritating, utterly useless sidekicks whose dialogue makes you wonder if the director and screenwriter are closet racists.  There's also a group of soldiers who are okay, but they have like five lines of dialogue between them, and their entire contribution to the first 4/5 of the movie is to show up periodically to walk slowly and look saintly.  The plot is somehow simultaneously inordinately convoluted and entirely unnecessary.  Most of the screen time that isn't just things blowing up or spinning involves Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox arguing about when one of them is going to tell the other one they love them, or else Shia's parents screeching about random ridiculous crap.

There are robots in this movie, but most of them look and sound exactly the same.  (There's one cool sequence early on with a tiger-shaped robot and his tiny friends, but that's definitely the exception.)  Megatron and Starscream are essentially the same character.  I couldn't tell which object was Ironhide until 2 hours and 15 minutes into the movie.  I don't have any idea who the other Autobots were, besides Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.  It's hard to care at all about the outcome of a battle when you can't tell who's who, so the fight sequences here are about as compelling as footage of an iPhone in a blender.  That can be fun, sure, but it's certainly not worth 2 and a half hours of your time.

If you want to know if you'll enjoy this movie, look at the reviews from people who liked it.  Do they sound like intelligent people who share your tastes and values?  If you think they do, you'll probably enjoy it.  If you want more in a movie than TV sitcom-level dialogue, a couple of Maxim models, and some random explosions, then you probably won't.",1278201600,2,2426,4.724465558194774

3440948,3,B0019M5C0Q,"I kind of expected going in that this wasn't going to be a great movie.  I saw the first one and didn't really like it that much.  I also saw all of the bad reviews from reviewers that I tend to agree with.  But it showed up on my DVR so I figured. ""Well, why not. At least I can give my surround system a workout.""

A couple of expectations going in.  Obviously this was not going to be a serious movie, so as long as it didn't completely insult my intelligence, I could probably find a way to enjoy it.  Additionally, having an attractive woman in the movie can make up for a whole lot of bad movie in my book.  They of seemed to go out of their way to have attractive women in there and show them off which was great.

So, while this wasn't a particularly intelligent movie, I wasn't insulted.  I managed to enjoy it for the most part and didn't feel like I had lowered myself too much to enjoy it.  There was a lot of humor in it as well which was a lot funnier than the attempts in the first movie.  A guilty pleasure if you will.

It did have one thing that bothered me though that cost it a star.  Like I said, this isn't a serious movie but it has a lot of violence.  If you are going to make a movie like that, you shouldn't take death too seriously.  By that I mean it's ok to kill lots of people, but don't dwell on it or try to make it meaningful.  Just kill them and pretend it didn't happen.  It's ok to kill main characters though and of course drag out they're dying words.  That's acceptable.

What I didn't find acceptable was the opening scene with the big robot running through the city.  Obviously lots of people got killed which is fine, but then the next scene showed flag draped coffins of US soldiers who got killed in the battle.  A non-serious movie like this really shouldn't have gone there.

It happened again the the sinking of the aircraft carrier.  If you are going to sink an aircraft carrier for no other apparent reason than to show off some cool effects (and it was cool looking), don't show bodies of drowned sailors in the water after it sinks.  The imposition of serious consequences layered on top of all the silly (but cool looking) violence just didn't work for me.  I'm sure there's an unwritten movie making rule about that somewhere but I guess they missed it.

So that's it.  It's watchable and I enjoyed it.  I don't feel like I wasted my time by missing out on watching a potentially better movie.  That's really about the best you can say about a movie like this.  I liked it enough to give it four stars but they lost one for trying to take themselves a little too seriously.",1277164800,2,2626,4.214859437751004
3440949,5,B0019M5C0Q,"Ok, some of you are wondering why I gave this 5 stars and I will explain. Let's discuss the story. Sam (LaBeouf) is ready to go to college and be a normal guy. It all goes to hell in a handbasket as the Decepticons steal a fragment of the All Spark and revive Megatron! The Autobots ask for Sam's help, who declines. Soon enough, Sam is in trouble as Megatron tries to capture him because he holds the map to where the Matrix of Leadership is kept. During his rescue, Optimus is destroyed and the Autobots are asked to leave the planet by the government. Sam, now feeling responsible goes on a quest to find the Matrix to revive Optimus and learns that they Transformers have been on Earth for millions of years, led by the Fallen. It is this Decepticon that wants the Matrix to destroy the sun and take it's energy for himself!

So now, there is way too much camp and comedy. The story lacks continuity. Megan Fox is hot but can't act. Shia is charmingly annoying. Who is the idiot that plays Leo? Skids and Mudflap....oops? Here is why I give it 5 stars! The Transformers themselves! They are the movie! Frank Welker from the cartoon voices Soundwave. Jetfire! There are more Autobots and Decepticons to enjoy! But the real reason for 5 stars....OPTIMUS PRIME!!! For the first time fans get what they've always wanted, Optimus unleashed. He is a force in this movie and basically kicks a$$ and takes names later! For these reasons, I forget everything else. No one will ever confuse Transformers for Casablanca! That's not what these movies are about! Way go Bay and co.

Nuff' Said

For real though, this is my least favorite movie I ever saw.  There are too many comic relief charecters, this causes you to take the plot not seriously.  Along with that none of the charecters stood out as being likeable or interesting.  This could have been due to badly choosen actors, such as Megan Fox and Sheia Labeouf.  In fact the humans shouldn't even have had a story line in a Transformers movie, it should have been all about the robots, because thats what people who pay to see a transformers movie want to see,  ROBOTS TRANSFORMING.  Besides this the movie dragged on for 2 and and a half hours.  Im not saying movies shouldn't be long, but if its long it should be entertaining to watch, such as the Die Hard series (each about 2 hours and 10 minutes), FIght Club ( 2 hours and 19 minutes), or the Alien trilogy (all about 2 and a half hours).  It seems to me that if they cut out all the parts with the humans they could have focused more on the robots , thus improving the movie and making it way easier to sit through due to a shorter length.  Another thing I would like to metion is the movie Transmorphers: Revenge of the Fallen form Asylum studios.  They made a movie about robots fighting  humans.  Now this movie was pretty bad, it had about the same level of acting and a much worse special effects  ,but one thing it did have was a shorter run time of 1 and a half hours, making it easier to sit through and didn't at all feel like a death sentence.  At the top I made a lack luster attempt at a joke but I actually prefer Planet 9 over Transformers the movie, one reason is again the run time is only 79 minutes along with that the movie didn't lie to me saying this is the best movie, it is a cheeply made made film about aliens.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is the voice acting for Optimus Prime and Megatron is pretty good............no matter how bad the script can get.

Im going to leave you with this,  one of the main reasons this movie was so bad could be due to the fact that it was called Transformers, one of the most beloved series ever.  If this was called Robot Wars could it have been a much better movie?

3440982,3,B0019M5C0Q,"This review is of the single disc edition DVD.

I'm not a cinema snob. I can watch an action film, turn my mind off and enjoy the explosions. For these types of film Michael Bay usually delivers and to a degree the first Transformers did. With Revenge of the Fallen he attempts to continue the story, upping the ante with a vast array of larger robots, bigger stakes and more scantily dressed ladies. Unfortunately in super-sizing these aspects others became watered down.

The story is non existent. The Decipticons are back and they want our sun for energy. It's that simple. Sam (Shia Labeouf) moves from pointless encounter to encounter without progressing the character or the plot. Megan Fox has little impact beyond being eye candy. Other secondary characters are of little importance and rehash their same old ideas.

What really disappointed me was the opportunity to expand the existing Transformer characters and that doesn't happen, at all. I believe Optimus Prime shares one scene with Sam and only Bumblebee really returns. A wasted opportunity. In their place are a couple of `comedy' bots in the style of gangster wanabees. Cringeworthy at every moment. The action also suffers. It has become more disjointed, hard to watch and understand the geography of the scenes. Someone explain less is more to Bay please.

With all these criticisms it may sound like I hate this movie. Far from it. I'm always happy to see an exploding robot, it looks expensive and Shia's Sam is always interesting to watch.

I would recommend this as a Saturday night movie when little else is on. Make some popcorn, open a beer and zone out.",1272672000,3,1633,4.859712230215828

3440985,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Oh God...where to start with this...to be perfectly honest, when I first heard that the sequel to 2007s ""Transformers"" was coming out around last Spring, I was fairly excited. While not in the same echelon as say, Terminator 2, the first installment in the series was a visually impressive and enjoyable, even if not particularly well directed sci-fi/action flick that I liked when I saw it in theaters. Granted, I'm not a very big Michael Bay fan - before I saw Revenge of the Fallen Pearl Harbor was solidly my least favorite movie of all time - but I figured if he could make a movie I enjoyed I could give this movie a chance. Even with all the hype that had built upon its release, much of which being negative, I still had a level of curiosity. Maybe it would be entertainingly poor. So this past weekend after a nearly a year of the films release, me and a friend of mine dug up the DVD out of boredom and popped it in, thinking we would get a similar fun/dumb action flick similar to the original, or at least something of such poor quality that it was actually entertaining.

In all honesty, I have no recollection whatsoever of the plot line of those film. Something along the lines of Sam going to college and going nuts and Megatron apparently somehow being revived...I honestly don't know. All I know is that the first hour or so of this film is probably the most unintentionally hilarious piece of film I have ever seen - thanks in large part to Shia LaBeoufs acting abilities, or should I say lack thereof. The scenes with LaBeouf seeing the symbols - his spastic facial expressions combined with the stuttering are pure comedic gold, whether or not this was there intent. The climax of it all is the scene when Sam, with a constantly overexposed Megan Fox onlooking, being seduced by a Decepticon guised as an attractive girl at his school, when the Decepticon reveals itself via its extend able robot tongue, which was humorous enough in itself. Afterwards LaBeouf lets out nothing less than a scream of a higher pitch than most elementary school girls, a coupled with a sincere facial expression. My friend and I literally fell out of our chairs laughing.

Unfortunately, the movie does not continue in this comedic fashion, in fact the next half of the movie is just plain painful and confusing. Locations shift at least 20 times in a 5 minute period at one time, too many new characters are introduced at once, and the climax of the pure crap comes when at Sams death scene, in which not only does a generic and pitifully done ""I LOVE YOU"" by Megan Fox take shape, but Sams spirit actually ascends to Robot Heaven (I kid you not). My friend actually left the room about 3/4 of the way through because he couldn't take it, and after the movie was done I was actually in physical pain for the next half our or so. Another film has joined Pearl Harbor on the top of my cinema blacklist - I honestly don't know which is worse - and Michael Bay has officially ruined his chance of being redeemed in my eyes. The first hour is recommended though, just for the pure comedy of it, but be sure to end once the scream scene is over.",1271808000,28,3142,4.481675392670157

Popular art offers simple and accessible material that can be appreciated by anyone, because it works with established conventions and techniques. But it can still be a richly rewarding experience.

I give this preface because the standard defense of this film is its low-brow nature. Transformers 2 is meant to be a 'mindless action flick'. I enjoy action films that do not tax the brain very much. But apparently this has been misconstrued by the makers of this film to mean that they have license to be mindless themselves while making it. And apparently heartless too.

This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. With every passing scene it sank below the lowest expectations that I had for its quality. The plot was entirely incoherent. The acting was laughable, and the younger women completely exploited for their appearance. The premises of the Transformers universe were violated or disregarded in completely unnecessary ways (apparently they can assume human form?). Every attempt at humour went for the absolute lowest common denominator of tasteless sexual or racially-based jokes, and scenes which called for some genuine emotion were unintentionally funny (robot heaven?). The much-vaunted special effects produced scenes that were almost impossible to follow due to the lack of differentiation between the robots. The film is also far too long and completely uninvolving - I found myself yawning with boredom by the time we arrived at the supposed 'climax' of the film and during its most intense action sequences.

Yet this is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. I think we need to collectively meditate on this and what it means for our culture. Perhaps while wearing sackcloth and ashes.",1269043200,4,2097,5.107871720116618
3441006,3,B0019M5C0Q,"This is a decent movie to own. I watched it and yes their is comedy relief. But would be nice if they made it more like the old cartoon series where the decepticons are in different colors. I was able to guess a couple of them, but not most. That is a flaw in my opinion that they should have fixed. I mean the autobots are in color, why not the decepticons.

As per the fembot, yes there is a fembot in this move, and she is hot. Gave Megan Fox a run for her money. Well she did run that is for sure. Also the new addition of Arycee, the female autobot was nice. Although it was way to dark in the movie for her scenes. They did change how she originally looked, but still I believe she looks good and hot. Arycee was always the autobot that was a little risky and had a sex appeal even if she is only a robot.

Hopefully if they create another movie, Michael Bay won't make everything so dark.",1268870400,,895,4.022471910112359

I love fun blockbusters.  I liked the first Transformers.  Now, to help myself down the road to recovery, I'm here to register my amazement at just. how. terrible. this heaping pile truly is, in EVERY regard.

Why was every human present trying to talk at the speed of the guy in the old micromachine commericals?  Even when I caught all the words, none of what they were saying made any sense or added any plot.

Was it just me or were Sam and Micaela the worst on-screen couple ever?

Were the humping dogs and, yes, robots, necessary?  No forget necessary.  Were they even funny?

Why did the writers feel that Sam's mother needed 15 minutes of the movie to herself?  This was the worst onscreen presense I can recall in ANY film... Jar Jar Binks, you were sadly missed...

Could we get more breasts onscreen please??  I mean, seriously, there weren't enough.  For a 'francise' based on pre-teen toys based off a cartoon and a film catering to boys of that age group, this revolted me.  The credits would be more accurate if they read:

Shia LaBouf
Megan Fox's breasts

By the way, could someone please explain the plot to me?  Here's the best attempt I can make:

Evil, giant, advanced robot killing machines were smacked down thousands of years in the past by... cavemen.  And now they want revenge.  Insert random dog scene.  And the good robots are here to protect humanity.  Too bad they either sporting buck teeth and dumbo ears (those 2 freak robots); prancing around like hairless, doe-eyed puppies (Bumblebee); or strutting around on screen with no other purpose than to blast those 'punk-ass Decepticons' (words of Optimus Prime).  Insert breasts.  Sam's got hold of a rock that seems to hold all the answers to the past, present, and future of the universe.  Insert random, stock college dorm scene.  Those punk-ass Decepticons devise an ingenius plot to get Sam alone involving a truly creepy babe-bot.  Fully 10 minutes are spent developing this side plot, and meanwhile, about 1 minute is devoted to explaining the entire backstory and busting Megatron out of his watery prison.  Insert more breasts, more college dorm scenes, but this time, add running and screaming.

I'll leave it at that.  I could write a short novel on how awful this was, but that would require me to watch it again.",1268265600,3,2461,4.7334905660377355

How it is possible that so many people working on a high budget movie don't realize they are producing crap?

The only good thing in the whole movie was the fighting on the woods where Optimus dies, really well done. But again like in the first movie the machines look way too complicated, is difficult to follow the action.

3441012,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Last night walking to my local Hollywood Video store (which is closing down) I found a fair amount of DVD's for only $5. Browsing around I found some interesting items and also I found Transformers 2. I never got a chance to see it at the movies, and me not being a big fan of the cartoons but a fan of its prequel I decided to purchase it since it was at that price. I already knew what many people and critics said about the film; when it hit the theaters I was disappointed to read all the negative appraisals from websites and people from work that viewed it.  Still I decided to give it an opportunity.

The movie first of all definitely encloses what an action summer blockbuster should have: loud explosions, great special effects, nonstop action, good battle sequences; but unfortunately Michael Bay thought that the juvenile act on some autobots and decepticons and even including Sam's parents would enhance the film: the pointless gags, the `ghetto' slangs from the twins, their bothersome voices, leg humping (which I cannot blame since it was on Megan Fox -what a beauty-), showing off their testicles, and so forth. But beyond all those ridiculous happenings I found a movie that entertained me which was its principle.  In fact, the plot was more thought of than the original making you think that Michael Bay probably wanted to take the film to a different direction, but whoever thought of the entire lame jokes I stated literally killed what could have been a better movie.

There is no essence to this movie that you should look forward to but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't see it. Don't expect to watch a movie that contains a mature atmosphere because after all, it's only Transformers.",1267228800,,1714,4.703333333333333

I never got into the cartoon as a kid and, to be honest, I only ever owned ONE of the action figures (a T-Rex) and my father broke it accidentally and never replaced it, but I didn't really care.  No, I only went to see the film because my best friend at the time was insistent that we go, and so we did, and I was truly entertained.  Yes, it had many faults (the graphics, while amazing, were a little bulky and the film was overly long) but it was a great way to waste a day, that's for sure.

This one, is just a wasted day; period.

Hollywood, popcorn munching, big-budget, explosion filled, mind numbing spectacles have no business crossing the two-hour mark; ever.  Okay, so some of them have, and some of them warrant that (I still love `Armageddon') but for the most part, two-hours is pushing it.  There is only so much you can do with that kind of atmosphere, and if you ware out your welcome you diminish any affection one may have towards the film as a whole.  This film is roughly an hour too long.  In fact, once they reach the desert, it's pretty much a collage of repeated sequences that made me want to pick out my eye-balls.

How many times can you have the same battle before the audience just walks away?

I liked the college part of the story, even if the parents were gimmicky caricatures (the mother was the funniest part of the whole film though, and it should be mentioned that she is also the most memorable).  I liked the faux tension between Sam and Mikaela, even if you don't really care about them as characters (yes, she is hot and he is charming, but really, who cares?).  I liked the base storyline, even though after a while things got confusing and rather stupid and just completely fell apart in the end.  To make a long story short, it opened with promise (a lot of promise) but it just went downhill, fast.

I'm one of those rare guys who likes Shia LaBeouf.  I don't like the fact that he is dating the ubber hot and superiorly talented Carey Mulligan (marry me Jenny) but whatever.  At least he is talented (who would have ever guessed that?) and so I really hope that he has a big career after this phase in his life is over.  I mean, it's a big thing for a star this young to get a franchise like Transformers, because it paves the way for him to make something of himself.  He is a household name now because of this movie, but I think he has more in store than this drivel.

Oh, and can I just say that this films racial stereotypes (those ghetto robots) are insulting.  I was blown away that they would GO there with this film.

I'd watch the first half of the film and then shut of down before it ruins itself.  Isabel Lucas is extremely hot here and steals Fox's thunder a bit (although she's only in the first part of the film, so BOO) and Shia keeps the charm coming full throttle in order to keep you somewhat interested.  The graphics are the same as before, except there is more of them this go around, and that proves to be a blessing and a malediction.  The forest fight sequence is great; everything in the desert is not.

Seriously, turn this off about half way through and you'll be satisfied.",1264377600,3,3218,4.330550918196995

3441075,5,B0019M5C0Q,"I had very high expectations going into this movie so anything short of a masterpiece was unexeptable. I was not dissapointed one bit. Michael bay has mad another classic that i will watch over and over. He is one of my favorite directors who is pushing the edge in how realistic everything looks, and on blu ray this movie is jaw dropping. I will warn you if you have no scence of humor do not watch this movie. I believe the comic reliefin the movie is perfectly placed and i would have to say i love the twins.

Now the only down side to the movie is for young kids. It is a little rique in the begging for youngsters especailly sice a lot of kids are intrested in watching transformers, but after the first 25 min are over it steps right into the action packed movie you payed to see.

Story line. I believe this movie has a great story line that draws you in. The story makes you love the characters and hate the bad guys, it makes you laugh and grabs you makes you think how will this work out. This movie keeps you guessing. I won't spoil the fun for you but if you havnt seen it you better stop what you are doing and watch this movie.

Comic relief. Iam a huge fan of the twins after watching this movie. I don't believe the comic relief was over used but i think my favorite part to watch is shi leboef screaming like a girl, you cant help but laugh at that.

Graphics, OMG. This movie is so realictic i catch my self trying to pick out where the reality ends and the CGI kicks in. I have to comend Michael Bay and staff on the amazing job on the reality of this, it can almost make you believe this could actually be real.

Over all this movie is great entertainment, and nothing short of a masterpeice. Although Michael Bay is an under rated director in my view his talent will be seen one day by all and will be recognised widely for it. If you have a sense of humor and are looking for a moving and jaw dropping movie this is definatly somthing you will want to buy and keep for a lifetime.",1263945600,2,2004,4.141388174807198

There is noise in the dark scenes.  The actors skin looks like sand in several scenes because the video is so grainy.  There are several scenes where it looks like some kind of biasing was applied, possibly for copy protection, that is very distracting from action on the screen.

I then tried to watch it a third time with just the BD player hooked straight up to the monitor without a receiver in the middle and and was so distracted by the video quality that I gave up and took the disc to Definitive Audio where I purchased the BD player and monitor to trouble shoot my settings.

I actually got a couple good laughs out of this one. Pulled off a few humor situations.

Plot holes are present. It is a mindless popcorn movie you know. Not a 5 star by any stretch. I thought it was better than the first one.  M Fox working in a garage in dukes and sleeveless shirt was moronic but looked good as intended. Just needed 5lbs. of grease smeared on her for ""realism"", lol.  Hot exhaust pipe on those bare legs would cure her of those shorts.

Big budget one liners and sight gags are the spikes forced into my ears and this one has them too, robot testes, love thing, man thong and the like.  90% of Terminator one liners were a travesty to all forms of entertainment too. If a movie costs over 75-100 million it starts out with strike one most times anyway. Designed for the lowest common denominator.

The fight scenes are surprisingly intense. Found myself tensing up like a real fight scene does. Things move a little fast, I can follow it just would like to see it a little longer, would have more impact. Did I say plot holes?  Just a few and easy to ignore. Space boss made no sense as depicted.

It earned an extra star even with all its problems because it was entertaining. Fox looks good. She does need to be quiet in the press some. I thought of some her statements during the movie, not a good sign. I usually shut that off while watching. Shia has charisma.

This was more like watching a script that was meant to be part of another movie, then adapted to be a Transformers movie. The producers just threw in additional autobots that have nothing to do with the Transformers franchise. The story doesn't even go in line with the concept of the Transformers. Why fabricate a villian no one has ever heard of, when there are PLENTY and I mean PLENTY! of major Decepticon villians they could have introduced... like Hello UNICRON!

  I also don't understand why the major players from the TV show are made to seem as extra's and lackies in these movies. Star Scream was never a coward he was always ready to take control. He never feared Megatron so why does he become his rag doll in the movie? I don't get why the producers decided to create so many new and unheard of decepticons. The Decepticons have their own squad of recognized soldiers just like the Autobots do. They did it in the last film so why are they so absent in this one?

 I was really dissapointed with this film, and while I thought the first one was ""ok"" aside from the Transformations being too technical it was an enjoyable film. Revenge of the Fallen is makes ""Batman and Robin"" (the one with george clooney)look like ""The Dark Night"". This film is absolutely terrible, and for a show made originally for children to watch, there is no way any child under the ager of ""21"" could watch this film. There is just too much foul language, sexually suggestive themes, and adult humor going on in this film. I was really suprised to see all of these vulgarities in a ""Transformers"" movie. Even if it is live action, it's still a story made for children (I know because Optimus Prime and GI Joe raised me). It was more like a slap in the face to anyone that loves transformers. They took a series that was made to teach kids moral principles about life and turned it into a film with a decepticon humping a girls leg. I mean they just took a dump on my childhood Saturday mornings and I didn't appreciate that.

 I've never been a fan of Michael Bay's films, and seeing Revenge of the Fallen reminded me why. View at your own risk and make sure your children are not in the room.

3441115,5,B0019M5C0Q,"BACKGROUND
Although I was a fan of the original Transformers TV cartoons and toys, I had little interest on this new incarnation. I even saw the first movie at home, much after its theatrical release but I didn't understood many of the changes from the original cartoons to the action live movie. After that, I bought a DVD of the original 80s cartoons in a local shop; let me tell you that I didn't remembered how silly those cartoons were!. Ridiculous dialogues, inconsistent plots, so I ended giving away the DVD to a 7 years old nephew (I don't know if he like it or not). After that I saw the movie again and then I understood that all the changes were absolutely necessary.

When Revenge of the Fallen showed in theaters I went to see it and I loved it! I think it's far superior to the first movie.

PLOT
What would you expect of a movie based around alien giant robots and inspired on an animated show of the 80s?.... My answer to that question is just FUN!, and this movie it's all about FUN!

Explosions, robot fights, silly high school jokes, destruction and lots of CGI action are the principal ingredients of this exciting larger than life film. Even a very serious and dramatic final fight scene is involved.

PERSONAL COMMENT
I don't understand the people who are giving all these bad reviews. Really, I don't know what they were expecting for?, if you are feeling intellectual, please try ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or other Academy Awarded movie. Come on, this is a (Non Academy Award contender) summer pop corn movie!, enjoy it!

Does excessive CGI bothers you?, remember this one is based on a 100% animated show, so don't complain!

CAST
What can I tell you, of course that acting is not memorable, but the film is not about the actors, it's about giant CGI robots. Said that, Megan Fox is still hot, John Turturro is ""stupidly funny"", Josh Duhamel is perfect as Major Lennox (He is the kind of guy I would have liked to play Duke in the G.I.Joe movie). Michael Bay does a great job here (a very interesting documentary about Michael Bay and his directing style is included on disc 2).

MUSIC
The music and score is good. The score is far superior to G.I.Joe's for example. It follows the action well and adds drama at the end of the film.

CONCLUSION
This is a very good movie within its genre. Not intended for children, but for action/sci-fi followers and fans of the original 80s cartoons, who now are 30+ year old folks. If you are tired and want to relax and forget about the report you have to deliver tomorrow to your boss, or just want to spend a Sunday evening at home, this is the perfect movie for you.",1262563200,3,2649,4.504166666666666

Entirely awful in every respect, this is a nauseating, headache inducing nightmare that feels much longer than its 2 and a half hour running time. Although I hate to admit it, I DID enjoy some of the first TRANSFORMERS film (not much but enough to make me waste my time with this sequel). There is no story and nothing that could be called acting this time around.  All the characters simply shout at each other and scream their lines as quickly as they can (sometimes screaming so fast it is impossible to comprehend what they are saying). The CGI robots are intensely boring and overdone. There is LOTS of crude humor and every ""joke"" is some sort of sexual reference. And did I mention that the women in the cast are all portrayed as skanky whores?  Well they are.  When was the last time you saw a woman airbrushing a motorcycle in a porn star pose with her nearly bare ass in the air?  EVERY scene is edited so quickly that nothing appears on the screen for more than 10 seconds at a time and most shots last under 3 seconds.  It is impossible to ever get a look at what is really going on (if anything is).  Of course, if the box office is any indication, we can expect to see more of this nonsense from the most untalented sucessful ""film"" maker in history, Michael Bay, a being so devoid of true talent that the mind boggels. Displaying all the faults of American society, TRANSFORMERS 2 is always big, loud, overpowering, obnoxious, boring, and hateful.  It is why terrorists hate us.",1262304000,,1640,4.498316498316498

This movie reminded me alot of those child-hood shows and the japanese shows i mentioned, sure its not the best explaned plot (like i heared megaton was put on the ocean floor cause they can't stand the cold) yet other robots go down and save him (IDK maybe they upgraded there circuitry?)All i know is that me and my 58 year old mother loved this flim, the twins we're funny, the part with sam's mom eatting a pot browne was funny too.  I really had a laugh and it didn't feel that it was almost 2 hours long.  I was kind of upset that bee didn't talk, but its all good.

It's the  middle third that lets the film down in a bad way - a horrifically misjudged pirate robot is hysterically bad, along with a little gangster robot and a bunch of boring humans wandering around for ages trying to dream up some daft macguffin to explain what is going on and failing spectacularly.

Either skip the entire section (you miss nothing) or simply acknowledge that this part of the film can only be enjoyed with post modern irony, much as you might find an Uwe Boll movie hilarious - the dreadful yet profoundly expensive choices on display in this part of the film are so outrageously bad my friends and I have been in stitches.

My irrational love of this movie lies in the robots - there are heaps of classic decepticons on display - Soundwave! Ravage! Insecticons! Constructicons! The set pieces are truly bravura and this time ypu can actually see what the robots are doing in their fights. On that note I must insist you pick up the big screen edition. No digital copy (whatever, don't need to see this on my ipod thanks) but those precious few sequences in IMAX frame have a fabulous impact on the film: the forest fight between Prime and a bunch of deceps and Devastator combining for Bayhem at a pyramid. They are gorgeous sequences and well worth tracking down this edition for.

This film works best when the autobts are trying to do something and the decepticons attack. That happens a lot in the movie - just like it use to do on your bedroom floor. There are none of the traditional values of cinema craft on display here, just like box office behemoth Mamma Mia. That film wasn't for me (women simply saying hello by way of screaming gives me tumors), this film is for me. Loads and loads of robots transform and jump about and explode everything.

3441168,1,B0019M5C0Q,"2 and a half years ago, a movie was released which changed my life.  That movie was transformers.  It was an incredible, beautiful work of art, with spectacular effects, an amazing story, and all around awesomeness.  So you can only imagine my excitement when I first heard they were making a sequel.  I stayed up, late into the night, reading every fan forum I could find, relishing in every tiny detail released or discovered.  And when the trailer came out, Oh man! I thought this movie would for sure complete my life.  I counted down the days till I'd be able to finally see it, getting premiere tickets at midnight.  As I sat in the theater, eating popcorn and candy, heart racing, I braced myself for what I expected to be one of the greatest movies of all time.

It started off with Optimus Prime narrating, like in the first. It was ancient times; there were cavemen, running around to epic music, and suddenly, a transformer shows up, and epically attacks them.  At this point, I'm so excited, I'm nearly certain this will be great.  And pretty much, from that point on, everything went south.  Way south. Like an 89 degree angled slope.  The transformers which I had known and loved from the first movie were now working with the military (wtf) in some corny secret group called nest.  So apparently, they add like 15 new characters, and throw them in a city where they mindlessly fight with the occasional good scene.  This is also the scene where we are introduced to the twins: a group of racist jokes on wheels. They beat the bad guys, and say some corny lines with the millitary of whom they are now BFFs.

Now we are with Shia Labeouf, the only good aspect of the movie, and he is packing up for college. Oh yeah, and they have another dog: cue the sleazy jokes and humping. So, Sam (Shia) finds a piece of the all spark (From first transformers) in some old clothes, and it makes all his kitchen appliances turn into ridiculous looking robo-demons.  He yells for Bumblebee who saves him.  And as a thank you Sam decides he's not going to take him along to college.  Right. Leave your 2010 Camaro behind. Meghan Fox does some non-acting (because I'd be ashamed to call whatever the hell she does acting) and the camera spins around her and Sam as they argue about who loves who. (Note: Camera is spinning so fast, you feel like vommiting)  Sam goes to college with his parents, and meets his roommate who claims that there are giant robots that the government is hiding.  Okay first off, WTF! In the last movie, hundreds, if not thousands of people witnessed giant robots tear apart Los Angles.  How the hell does the government conceal that, convince that many people not to talk, and then repair the city, and then dispose of the giant robo-bodies WITHOUT EVERYONE KNOWING! Ever heard of cellphone cameras! Well. Ahem.... after that, some transformer who looks like a girl seduces Sam, and then transforms into an awkward android with a long tail and tongue, who Meghan Fox proceeds to kill.

And from that point on, things keep getting confusing.  The Fallen is mad, and he's coming to Earth, but for some reason a group of Decpticons are going to revive Megatron just for poops and giggles. Sam leaves college, and through some strange time warp travels across the entire world in just  a few hours.  (Note: There is no time warp.  Its just the only way I can explain it) Optimus prime dies, but not really; the fallen tries to kill the sun, and fails; Megatron and Starscream run away, again; the racist robots don't learn their lesson; and Meghan Foxes pants never get dirty running around the middle-east.

This movie is terrible. It has too many sexual jokes and crude humor (Robot humping and Robo-Balls. I don't think so) and everyone (but Shia) sucked at acting.  There is no explanation for new characters, whose names only get mentioned once, and if you expect even the slightest character development, you may want to go with a different movie, like per say.... G-Force.  And as I said before, this movie makes absolutely no sense. (Sam goes to Robot heaven. WTF!!! ROBOT HEAVEN!!!!!)  If you were looking for a good sci-fi movie with decent effects, good acting, and interesting story, I'd suggest District 9. (District Nine is incredible.  It was one of the best movies this year)  If you are looking for lackluster confusion and idiocy, wrapped in bad jokes and glitter, then Revenge of the Fallen is perfect for you.",1261872000,3,4451,4.644955300127714
3441169,1,B0019M5C0Q,"If this isn't the worst movie ever made, it's certainly the worst blockbuster ever made. And, I've seen Attack of the Clones. And for that matter, I've also seen Dune, Howard the Duck, The Never Ending Story and this much of Battlefield Earth. Not blockbusters, but they can join in on the fecalitous fun.

And it's not that I have ever had a problem with Michael Bay. I very much enjoyed The Island, Armageddon and The Rock. Even Bad Boys 2, despite it's dialogue. I thought the first Transformers was awful until the last 20 minutes then Bay did his thing and well. Pearl Harbor was just Brandon, Dylan and Kelly going to Hawaii until they do a Top Gun inspired episode before going back to the Bermuda Love Triangle. It was also an excellent showcase for Josh Hartnett who managed to look like Tommy Lee Jones and sound like Keanu. Impressive, most can't do both. But I digress...

Back to this, this, thing. The issue with Bay has never been that he agressively goes after the lowest common denominator, it's that the lowest common denominator is not near low enough for him. It's one thing to go after the Nascar crowd, it's another thing to try to appeal to them when they're drunk.

And Sheia LaBarf? Man, Jim Belushi isn't this lucky! And Ms. Fox would have been a much lovelier presence, if you couldn't see Bay's fingerprints all over her so she can be positioned just so. And if she thought that was degrading and humiliating, what about the things she is made to say to this little muppet put in the hero role. Seriously, this guy's about as charasmatic as Jay Mohr and as about as manly as an Air Supply song.

Then the ghettobots. Que pasta? Michael Bay actually reminds me more of Michael Scott from The Office. Just this accidental racist who thinks he's just fitting in and being funny. Yeah, but when Michael Scott does it, it IS funny. In this case, only Pearl Harbor is funny.",1261785600,7,1896,4.518950437317784

3441177,4,B0019M5C0Q,"I will have to say, even though there are a lot of people who did not enjoy Transformers 2, I myself did enjoy it very much. I understand the complaints and criticisms towards the movie but when it is all said and done, this movie is all about giant robot fighting and that is exactly what we received.

I remembered watching the first Transformers trailer and felt appalled by the designs choices the movie maker took. It was a complete deviation of what fans grew up with and seemed an insult. But when I viewed the movie it was an amazing adrenaline, heart pounding, action thumping ride. I thought after the movie if the film makers decide to make a sequel how are they going to top the first, and they completely did, with regards to robots, actions, and explosions. The story itself is not too good, in fact a little shallow. The acting seems to deteriorate from the first, the comedy is force, and yes there are elements of racial stereotypes, but then again this is a Michael Bay film audiences should not be surprised.

But what the movie lack in its story it makes up with its amazing action sequences. More robots, more intense battle moments, more explosions, and more metal on metal action. If you thought Prime's battle with Bone Crusher in the first movie was amazing, wait until you see the other battle sequences. And lets not forget that Soundwave and Ravage is in the second movie. Much appreciated from fans even though it was but a couple of scenes.

I did not intend to watch Transformers 2 thinking I was going to received a thoughtful or even insightful story. I went to see Transformers 2 for more robots, more action, and more explosive shrapnel and that is exactly what I received, especially amazing in High Definition.",1261353600,2,1747,4.610932475884244

There isn't a lot I liked about this movie, even by seeing it in IMAX.  Watching the Autobot Bumblebee open a can of whoop@$$ on two Decepticons at the same time was cool.  Voice actor Peter Cullen reprises his role as THE voice of Optimus Prime (thank goodness).  Right before his final confrontation with Megatron and the Fallen (which was pretty bad@$$), it was awesome to hear Optimus Prime say a vigilant catchphrase originally from September 11, 2001.... ""Let's Roll!""

I've seen a lot better summer action movies than this train wreck.  Director Michael Bay and the screen writers have taken what could have been an exciting sequel based on a popular 1980s franchise and ""raped"" it!  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.",1261094400,,943,4.736196319018405
3441180,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I'm probably one of the last people to see this movie, and held out for a long time because of the negative reviews it has received from many people, both fans of the old Transformers cartoon series and new blood alike. But I needed to see it for myself, given the huge spread of people who loved it and people who hated it, to form my own opinion. Here's my review:

First gripe I have is that this movie is paced way too slow. While I understand that the writers wanted to reflect that Sam (Shia Labeouf) is becoming an adult (going to college) and moving beyond the events of the first movie, why was there such a need to draw this out? Last I checked, this was supposed to be an action movie, not a National Lampoon's fill-in-the-blank spoofy comedy. Between Sam and Mikela's questionable relationship (who will say ""I love you"" first, which the lack of chemistry between Labeouf and Fox doesn't help) to the over-the-top antics of his parents (namely the mother), a lot of the first hour of the movie seems unnecessary, except to focus upon the consequences of Sam's accidental possession of all-important shard of the All-Spark.

The sheer amount of sexual innuendo in this movie leads me to conclude that both Michael Bay and his cadre of screenplay writers actually believe that Americans are obsessed with sex. The scenes with the dogs, the astronomy professor (really? really?!), the robot dry-humping Mikela's leg, giant robot testicles... maybe this is a National Lampoon movie after all... I guess my true gripe is that if you're going to rate a movie PG-13 (which usually translates to ""bring your kids: the PG-13 rating is for violence""), they should probably keep the sexual humor tasteful and under the radar.

But here's the real meat and potatoes: Transformers 2 is boring. Seriously. I turned it off just one hour and thirty-seven minutes into it to go to sleep. The last half consists of Sam and the minor characters moving about to keep from being arrested by the authorities, with a few fight scenes in between, where they finally go to Egypt in hopes of preventing the world's destruction. Even the segments which should be thoughtful and moving (the sacrifices of two certain characters specifically) came across as cliche and cheap, and the last battle was very anti-climatic. I would hope that Bay and the screenplay writers would heartfully take lessons from this movie when they film the third one, but I doubt it.

To sum it up: don't waste your time or your money on this movie. There are far better action movies, far better classics that are more deserving of your attention. If you like the nostalgia you feel from the Transformers cartoons, buy the cartoons. Buy the animated movie, which is far superior to this. If you like giant robot movies/anime, check out the Gundam series (in-particularly, the 08th Team, 0080, and 0083). Check out the Macross series (even the newest installment, Macross Frontier). The characters are far better developed, the plot and the story-lines are excellent, and there's plenty of action!

This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, taking in to account budget, special effects, action sequences, etc. The first hour is utterly unwatchable. Horrible jokes, acting, as well as seizure inducing camera shots where you cannot even tell who is fighting who. The one star I am giving this movie is for the action sequence in the woods between Prime and Megatron, which was fantastic.

I couldn't believe how horrible this movie was, and I enjoyed and own the first Transformers on blu ray and standard dvd. This movie feels like its 6 hours long, and it will take you at least that amount of time to finish it.

I actually liked the first film more this time around, even though I still think it is way too long for the material at hand. The second film 'Transformers - Revenge Of The Fallen' takes everything good about the first film and just throws in away! The film is longer with bigger FX, but the FX are so fast that it's really hard to appreciate them. The film is also plagued with ridiculous humor that is so corny I rolled my eyes so much I thought they might fall out of their sockets! The parents in particular are just awful and serve no purpose at all, except to add some humor (if you can call it that?), but end up being distracting and silly. Megan Fox's roll has been reduced to shameful sexy eye candy(for a kiddie film)and Shia has reached an all time low here.

If you like films with no character development and tedious storylines, then this might be for you. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I hope it is the end to the series. Extremely disappointing film that isn't any fun at all.",1260835200,15,1120,4.258215962441315

3441188,2,B0019M5C0Q,"When the first Transformers came out, I thought there was no way that transformers could possibly work on the big screen (the concepts of being a giant robot one moment, then a car the next seemed rather uninteresting).  However, when I saw the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a great balance of action and comedy, and left me excited at the prospect of a sequel.  So this time I was excited for it, expecting it to surpass the original, in every way.  Sadly, the sequel greatly failed at every turn.  Rather than find a way to improve on the original, everything was more...much more.  Did you like the robot fights in the first transformers?  There's a lot more of those.  Wanted more transformers?  There's a ton here.  What about explosions and stuff blowing up?  There's that in spades.

But that's the problem...there's only more without any real improvements.  There's so many transformers that sometimes its hard to tell who is the good guys and who are the bad, making the multiple fights rather un-impressive.  There's so many explosions that you're almost numb to them half way through.  Rather than space everything out so there's some impact, its explosion, fight, explosion, fight, brief moment of story, explosion, fight, etc.  By the end, you're numb to everything.  So numb that you actually pay attention to the plot which makes no sense.  Why can only a prime kill the Fallen?  He doesn't have a special power, there's no electric reason, and they never mention any programming issue.  All prime does is bludgeon him anyway, so why couldn't anyone have done that.  Why is there a transformer heaven?  How are we supposed to believe building high machines are still a secret from the general public?

I guess the real problem is that there was no heart in the movie.  While I know the first was a product of corporate moguls, it didn't quite feel that way.  It felt like something fun and entertaining.  This felt like every scene had someone saying ""more explosions"" or ""more fights.""  While some may be entertained with this I was not.",1260748800,3,2066,4.762711864406779

Bay does a wonderful job integrating the action with his camerawork, it amazes me to this day.
The blu-ray version has colors so vibrant that you believe you are actually there.  And the best part is the behind the scenes:  methodically showing what went into this movie, which was a lot of hard work.
People bash Michael Bay movies for being vapid.  I don't expect to walk out of a movie quoting Kierkegaard;  I go to escape reality and immerse myself in pure entertainment.

Along the way, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, but who cares, the Decepticons always lose at the end of the day right? That is until new ones are created, or brought back to life by other pesky Decepticons from outer space. It is then where College Freshman Shia Laboef (I hate spelling his, or his character's last name) must then help save humanity, with the help of familiar friends and Meagan Fox, who filmmakers could find no better reason to be in this film other than cheesy emotional scenes and eye candy.

I must admit, this film is impossible for a real movie reviewer, or critics to review because their job title has them breaking down movies to see if you should enjoy them. Unfortunately, if you break this film down, it loses all it's fun. So don't think, just sit and enjoy.

See It If:

You like Awesome action: This is almost a pure action movie, because the fighting sequences are stunning, and really make you get into the movie despite any flaws it may have. Sure, a 20-minute action sequence may be overblown, but I was enjoying every moment of it.

You like comedy that is funny in the moment: To balance the intense action, the writers upped the quotient on comedy this time around, having several LOL jokes that kept a semi-permanent smile on my face throughout the film, especially in the college scenes. Kudos especially to Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson who play Shia's parents and teacher, respectively. I could have done without the juvenile scenes of dogs humping which a 6-year old sitting a few seats down from me found particularly enjoyable. However, don't think about these jokes later, because you mind lose your mind trying to wrap it around these jokes.

Don't See It If:

Your movies are driven on plot: This plot is one in the moment as you get it when it's happening, but you're left wondering later how the heck they got there. Again, don't think, just sit and enjoy.

Your tolerance for pure stupidity is low: Yeah, this has been beaten to death by other reviewers. You have been warned.

You hated the Transformers mythology: Because if you got confused before, you're going to be scratching your head here. It's like they went for the geeks, and left the rest of us just to ignore that aspect, because it gets confusing.

Now For Some Observations:

This movie is very grounded in 2009... Swine Flu jokes? Economy jokes? And a Chevy Volt? Will anybody get what any of this means in 10 years?

Speaking of which, from the first scenes GM makes their presence known because they must have gotten a HUGE contract with the government.

Obama is anti-Transformer! He's mentioned specifically by name in the movie as wanting to shut down the Transformers program as he feels they could be a threat to nation's security. I mean, he is pro immigration! His National Security advisor is also a jerk within the movie, so it shows poor judgement in his staff choices... Republicans, ravage at this fact, Democrats steer clear of these scenes.

Did the composer get lazy in this movie? I counted no less than 4 times Linkin Park's ""New Divide"" was played in the movie either instrumentally or in full. Same goes for Green Day's ""21 Guns"" which I counted no less than 5 times during the movie. It also happened to be the ONLY song playing in Meagan Fox's garage.

Again, a LOT of civilians die in this movie. In the first I was shocked when a Decepticon plowed through a bus, but in this movie, that's nothing. Buildings are wiped out, cars are smashed at will, aircraft carriers are blown up with no survivors. It's almost numbing after a while.

Overall:

In a survey of viewers that saw the movie, 91% said it was as good, if not better than the first. I would join these people in saying that what the first one sets up, the sequel takes and runs away with in explosive fashion.

3441201,5,B0019M5C0Q,"Since the release of 2007's  ""Transformers"" critics--mostly fans of the 1980's animated series--have labeled Bay's re-imagining of these shape-changing alien robots a complete failure, going so far as to claim that Bay ""hates the Transformers"" and ""wants to ruin our childhood memories.""

These detractors obviously have not seen the original Transformers  series since its 1984 debut, their perception of the modern films dimmed by their nostalgia. Look at the premise of the cartoon: On the distant planet of Cybertron a race of sentient robots are waging civil war. The two factions are the peace-seeking Autobots and the war-mongering Decepticons. Their seemingly endless battle somehow comes to the relatively young planet of Earth, where the Decepticons seek out significant power sources for universal conquest and the Autobots change into vehicles so they may disguise themselves among Earth's inhabitants while working to defeat the Decepticons. All of this adds up to big action, mindless robot fights, and stuff blowing up.

What's the plot of the movies? The same thing: The same robots from the same far-off plant come to Earth to fight the same war with the same strategies. The explosions are better, however.

There are three distinct differences between classic Transformers and the modern (dubbed by some the ""Bayformers""). 1) The Autobots no longer look like boxes with arms and legs (which is a good thing.), 2) one of the main characters is a stiff doll-like female capable of little real emotion (Megan Fox, the films' only significant downside. Actually, now that I think of it, there was a useless female human introduced in Transformers Season 2), and 3) Megatron does not immediately jump to the goal of Ruling the Known Universe. The first and third difference are unimportant ones that nevertheless make the movies slightly more realistic and slightly less dumb.

Michael Bay, believe it or not, does not what to ruin your childhood memories. Those cartoons and toys are still there for you to enjoy. If you cannot see the likeness shared by those cartoons on the modern films, I'm afraid your nostalgia is getting in the way of the facts (honestly, just go back and watch those terrible cartoons; you'll see exactly what I'm talking about). ""Transformers"" and ""Revenge of the Fallen"" serve up healthy portions of robot action, alien mythos, and underlying commentary on the human race.

Just like the originals.

Whether you like the Bay films or hate them, we should all keep two things in mind:
1) The Transformers has always been about big, dumb fun with robot action and transforming. To expect anything different from modern films is foolish, and practically your admission to wanting something different from the originals.

2) The 2007 and 2009 films are the re-imagining of a 1980's cartoon that served as little more than a series of lengthy commercials for, you guessed it, toys. It's all about toys, people.

3441202,4,B0019M5C0Q,"As many reviewers have already said, this was good and bad depending on whether you're an 11 year old or an adult. I'm the latter (usually). But this movie does have its moments. Trouble is, apart from Megan Fox, I can't really think of any specific ones right now.

In some (many) of the robot fighting scenes, I could see a big shiny robot fighting a big shiny robot. One was an Autocon, the other was a Deceptibot. Perhaps there'll be a competition later to see which one was which. I couldn't tell. Even in slow motion. And as for the awfully annoying twin robots (and Sam's mother) - if ever there was an argument for the bad guys to win, they were it.

At the airfield, around 19 minutes and 50 seconds in, two flags are showing - the American Flag and the Union flag. The Union flag is upside down. I hope someone would have noticed if the American flag was upside down. Why didn't they apply the same level of quality control to the rest? Attention to detail is important. It helps make things believable. Ish.

But for faster than you can follow action (is that good or bad?), some good dialogue (""don't tell my mother"" - had to laugh at Simmons) and lots of great explosions, this is one to watch. I would recommend it to anyone who can turn off rational thought and just get lost in the moment. And of course, Megan Fox.",1260057600,,1331,4.337349397590361

3441211,5,B0019M5C0Q,"This is a great example of what a movie and special features should look like on blu-ray.  A lot of distributers try to cram in useless extras like U-Control and BDLIVE, that simply don't satisfy the people who actually watch special features.  Transformers 2 has a good block of behind the scenes footage, which is all that is necessary.  Separate extra segments with titles, but put them all in the same 2 hour chunk of time.  I was very impressed with my Blu-ray edition, and I'm sure they designed this disc solely with the audience and fans in mind.  Other stuff like interactive games and transformers history are on the disc as well, which might not be as entertaining, but interesting none the less.  My only issue with the disc(Not the film) would be that Michael Bay sounds way too self-righteous on the interview segments.  There's about a 20 minute segment explaining how he knows its a good movie and how critics should be ignored.  I give him a moment to justify himself, but it seemed like too much time was wasted on this subject on the commmentary and behind the scenes.

Now as for the movie:  I happened to enjoy this film much more than the first one.  Main reason would be that the action sequences are a lot more crisp and clear.  I can actually see whats going on in the fights this time.  In the last film I had not a clue on who was kicking/punching/stabbing who.  I was glad to see that they greatly improved on this aspect, and took a wider shot approach, as opposed to the tight close ups.

Ok.  This movie has been bashed and criticized in every which way and a lot of it I do agree with.  The film is not smart or dynamic, but the one thing it is, is.......entertaining!  It would not have sold so many tickets if it was not this entertaining.  Michael Bay is making a movie for not only adults, but children as well.  Hundreds of children would be left in the dust if Bay tried to make this film an intelligent action thriller.  He has to take shortcuts and write lots and lots of jokes to keep people entertained.  Otherwise why would we want to watch it more than once.  In order to sell so many tickets, he needed to make a huge action movie with comedy sprinkled all over it.  Yea, it's a little cheesy at times and some ""dramatic"" scenes feel like cheap tricks, but I still gotta say that it's great entertainment.  Those expecting another Dark Knight or Star Trek will be majorly dissapointed.  What this film is about is entertaining a WIDE audience.  And it looks like more of the common people were satisfied, rather than the smaller population of critics and skeptics.  I happened to like it because it's just good entertainment.  It looks beautiful and the action scenes work well, and I even laughed a few times.  Don't expect the film to move you in any way.

3441223,1,B0019M5C0Q,"2009 was full of anticipated movies, with Transformers 2 being the most hyped about.  Opening during the summer with both regular and an extended-length IMAX versions, this movie quickly made back its $200 million budget and more.  But like many sequels, this was a big letdown from the first movie, as both critics and fans took jabs at the various parts of it.  Here is my take on why the movie sucked.

First, the comedy was a rehash of that found in the first movie, except closer to the gutter.  Transformers 2 features humping dogs, a humping decepticon, and dialogue around sex among both couples, Sam and Mikaela, and Sam's parents.  Nobody really wants to see old people talk about sex, especially if they remind them of their parents.  The stereotypical parents are worse than before; the wife, Julie is ditzy, with her ditziness juiced up by some pot brownies.  The husband, Ron, is still a knucklehead; cheap, conniving, and loud-mouthed.  Besides the sexually-oriented comedy, we also have the racial jokes and stereotypes.  This time, instead of having Anthony Anderson playing a geeky homeboy, we have two autobots who talk, and act like gangsters from the hood.  Everything from their slang, use of profanity, to their notions about reading, seem geared towards attracting the East LA crowds of hoodlums and bro's into buying tickets.  And last but not least, John Torturro is back as Simmons, sarcastic, bombastic and pretentious.  Having watched this movie twice, once at the theater and now once on DVD, I finally realize that the entire comedy routine of both the 1st and 2nd Transformers movies is built on dichotomies.  Basically, half the character are dead-serious all the time, and the other half are ridiculous all the time.  There is no-one in between, no person who acts serious when needed, and then cracks an occasional joke at the right moments.  Every character fits and is defined by a specific stereotype.

Second, the action scenes were totally unrealistic.  We see about a dozen autobots and several dozen decepticons in this movie.  All the decepticons are killed in battle except for Megatron and Starscream.  All the autobots live, except for Optimus, who is killed but brought back to life.  How is this possible, especially when many of the decepticons looked bigger and meaner than most of the autobots?  This was basically a robot version of Rambo or James Bond; the vastly outnumbered good guys never miss and never die of, while the bigger, meaner, bad guys all get killed of, with a couple of exceptions to make sure there is a sequel.  Its as if Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg took a storyline from one of the 80's action flicks, and replaced half the human characters with robots.  Utter lack of originality.

Third, the storyline is chock full of holes.  The most visible example is at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  When Jetfire stands up and opens the door to go outside, we are suddenly in the middle of a desert airfield.  How do we go from Washinton D.C. to a desert?  Another example is when the decepticons go live on worldwide TV and threaten to destroy the world's cities if mankind does not give them Sam Witwicky.  We then see decepticons standing atop various towers throughout the world's cities.  And then nothing.  Its as if all the decepticons left.  Why not destroy a couple of cities to make good on their threat.  For an action movie about a war on earth, there seems to be minimal collateral damage of any sort!

Probably the worst part of this movie is the dialogue.  All the transformers speak english almost the entire movie.  Even Soundwave, when giving orders from space, speaks in english.  Why would an alien race go out of their way to speak english.  The first Transformers movie was very realistic in that the decepticons always spoke their own language except when conversing with humans.  Why the letdown here?  Did Bay and Spielberg spend so much money on the explosions and other visual effects that they had to cut money on screenwriting some transformer dialogue in?  And then when the robots do speak, they have accents.  Why does Jetfire have an australian accent?  He lives in D.C., so if anything, he should have an East Coast or Virginian accent.  Its as if the movie makers decided that since australian actress Maggie Madsen was not in this movie, they could make up for her absence by having one of the transformers speak with an australian accent.

And my biggest beef with the movie is the brazen copying of the POTC movies.  In the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, we have Barbossa die and then come back to life, then we have Jack Sparrow die and then come back to life.  Here in Transformers 1 and 2, we have Megatron die and come back to life, followed by Optimus Prime who dies and comes back to life.  Can we have some other plot device please?!

All in all, this is probably one of the worst movies of 2009.  The only redeeming value is the package the DVDs came in, a case that opens up to become Bumblebee.",1259539200,,5021,4.73356401384083

It is, however, relatively long, clocking in at around two and a half hours. And given the magnitude of the effects this length may be borderline seizure-inducing.

3441239,3,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie is a harder movie to review than the previous one.  So I am going to stick to my ""good/bad/summary"" approach.

On the good side, I thought this movie had a lot more depth than the previous Transformers movie (which was much more a shallow movie for fans).  It is still not a deep movie, but it poses some material that can actually be food for thought.

On the negative side, I there were a number of things that REALLY bugged me about the movie and made it downright cheesy.  Having Optimus Prime spit out teeth during the fight is just wrong on so many levels.  Similarly the college scenes were extraordinarily cheesy by any standard.

If this is a movie just made for fans, I suppose I would have to say it doesn't measure up.  I think it was an attempt at something more, but where neither the director nor the screenwriter had any idea what that ""something more"" was supposed to be.  The result, while interesting to watch once, simply doesn't measure up.",1259020800,2,972,4.4772727272727275

I bought this sequel without seeing it at the theater despite all the criticism I'd read.  Well, I have to say that they made some very poor decisions in the writing department.  Whereas with the first movie it was fairly safe to have our young son watch this movie is riddled with out-of-place, awkward and unnecessary expletives that seem like they were added to the script just for the sake of having them.  I am not a prude in any sense but even I was put off by the very awkward inclusion of expletives.  On top of that are the stereotypical and racially insensitive new Autobot twins.  Even still Optimus Prime says things that seem very out of character.  Overall, the movie is OK with nice special effects and a few new characters but the movie is not anywhere near on par with the first film in the story or dialogue departments.

Most of the movie is spent watching Shia wandering around while the Autobots inexplicably keep abandoning him.  Come on, any 5 year-old playing with dolls can come up with a better storyline.  This movie is WAY too violent for kids, and WAY too stupid for anyone over the age of 10.

And this weak humor : Sam's mother smoking weed, the dumb autobot brothers, the big Decepticon having bollocks ... really make it feel like a comedy rather than an action movie but it doesn't succeed at any. It's barely saved by insane SFX and great cinematography.

3441251,2,B0019M5C0Q,"It's frequently difficult to make a sucessful sequel even for a proven revenue generating monster that was the first Transformers movie. In Revenge, the graphics and action sequenses continue to be brilliant, but they quickly get in the way of any story. The tale continues with the risen Decepticons making another try at eliminating Optimus Prime, his associate robots, and Earth's inhabitants, This of course leads them back to Sam who holds the device that is key to their renewal. OK. The storyline is fine and I went with it for the first hour or so.

But the chase becomes weary after a while and I kept hoping the Decepticons would do away with the John Tortoro character, Sam's scared college roomate, and his excessively hyperactive pot head mom. I can't see how Bay (or whoever assisted him on the production) could have found the need for obnoxious undressing scenes like Tortoro's butt in full frame, Sam's friend stumbling out of the head with his pants pulled down, and the aversion of illustrating robots taking a leak.

Out of ideas, what can a director do but overuse scenes of Sam holding on to the voluptuous Megan Fox tearing up the Egyption turf in the shadows of the pyramids while somehow avoiding hundreds of explosions. What the heck was Sam's mom doing there ?  One star for the effects and sound, one star for the Megan Fox visuals. Bay: Please don't do Transformers Reloaded.",1258675200,,1404,4.769547325102881

3441257,1,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie includes blatant racism, overt sexism, gratuitous sexual content and violence, juvenile sight gags, and its most heinous crime- it tries to pass off all these things as being for the kids. Let's be real- this product is very much marketing to kids under 13 years of age, and the only reason this thing didn't get a hard R rating is because the filmmakers had enough money to bargain for whatever rating they wanted. It's absolutely sickening that this is the state of Hollywood.

Don't get me wrong- I'm not a religious person nor am I masquerading as a reviewer for a family website. I love action movies and explosions, and I even like appropriate racial commentary when it's done right. I don't appreciate scene after scene of mindless special effects interspersed with gradeschool-level humor from a junior-level director.

If you think watching robots who walk around like gorillas, talking in ebonics, with gold teeth, saying they ""don't read much"" (I am really not kidding- there's two of them), is a fine way to spend two and a half hours, then may Vector Sigma have mercy on your spark. Having an obviously ethnic stereotype made up as an Autobot in the first movie call the group ""[...]"" was already appalling- why take it further? Answer: Because people will pay money to see it, apparently.

Some will say that this is all subjective. Maybe the twins aren't really that racist, maybe it's okay for kids to see a robot with visible testicles (again, not kidding), and maybe more than one shot of dogs humping is justified somehow by the plot (I wish I was making this up!). Even if you wanted to try and grant all that, you still have to admit that the plot makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and there are holes big enough to ride Devastator through. Why for example are metal robots grown in organic space-sacs, which not only contradicts all source material, but just doesn't make sense anyway? And you'd still have Michael Bay's terrible filmmaking, where there are too many quick cuts and the shakey camera is zoomed in too far on the action. With the overly complex robot designs, battles are often unintelligible blurs of gray and brown with random blocks of primary color thrown in for reference points.

The final justification by fans, over and over, is that this is just a kids' movie, and hey the original 1980s cartoon was pretty cheesy. Which somehow justifies filming dogs in the act of reproduction. No thanks.

Also, since when the robots have sense of humor? In my opinion it did not work.

I consider a great movie that after watching its stays in your head for day, two or longer. This movie stayed in my head for an hour, because the whole time I was thinking how much money producers spent on the production, and if got their money back.

3441298,1,B0019M5C0Q,"The series started out fairly promising...  Sure, there were problems with the first film.  Like continuity issues, juvenile humor and less robot time on screen than we would have liked.  But, we understood they took some shortcuts with that one because they weren't sure that there was an audience for this type of movie.  Overwhelmingly, they found out that there was.  The first film was enjoyable and showed some promise.

We expected a best-effort follow-up.  What a disappointment!  What an insult!

Now I understand there's a ton of merchandising that goes along with sci-fi movies.  Just look at Star Wars and the superhero movies.  But it appeared they threw out any notion of a story in favor of making more time for extended commercials and product placement.  Between the potential for toy and car sales, any notion of a credible movie was tossed aside.

Important autobot characters spend most of their time on the sidelines, so that more time is spent showing off the new GM concept cars. Let me get this straight, the transformers turn into vehicles that reflect their personalities, right?  Okay, so how do a pair of twins that start out as two halves of an ICE CREAM TRUCK, change to sporty (concept) cars. Nevermind. Notice the loving, car-commercial angles of them that you get as you spend time with them during the oh-so-important character story arcs during the middle of the film.

Forget the poor acting, the needless scenes at college, the pointless juvenile humor, etc. But could we PLEASE have some semblence of continuity in this film, as well as in connection to the first.

Remember the police car decepticon from the first movie?  Remember how it drove off the freeway during the final chase and didn't return for the remainder of the film?  Maybe you thought he would return in this film?  You would be mistaken. I guess GM didn't want that Ford showing up again and told the filmmakers to give him the axe. After all, the scorpion-bot doesn't make an appearance at the end of the first movie, BUT DOES in this one. We seem to have a car company making story decisions, taking control away from those who should be in charge.

Intergalactic robots with superior alien technology and amazing transformational powers can't repair Bumblebee's voice?

After the heroic rescue of Sam by the autobots, Sam and Optimus drive away and manage to get OUT OF THE CROWDED CITY TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE (a forest), presumably miles away, BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE EVEN LEAVES THE BUILDING?

Sam and company go into the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC, then walk out the back door into a gigantic open field of derelict airplanes in the middle of nowhere (AGAIN).  Was it teleportation?

Apparently so, because that's exactly what happens to get them from where ever they were to Egypt. So the transformers can teleport?  Why aren't more of them doing it? I guess that was oh-so-important (never mind the continuity issues it created) in order that the story didn't drag (any more than it already was) in order to show any normal conventional travel. Like I said, continuity?  Oh well....

Why do intergalactic robots need a beard? a walking stick? [...]? Why is one humping a human's leg?

Like I said, it was a sad, sad thing. Such a disappointment, such a waste!

Sam who felt guilty for allowing his friend to die, went on a great journey to find redemption and save his friend as well as the  world and ultimately was rewarded for his bravery and sacrifice. As for the plot you have to really listen because details pertaining to the plot are not as obvious as in the first one.

If you have ever watched any of the interviews with the people who started the show, they will tell you that the reason the show was made, was to get kids to buy their toys. Sure they tried to have some good stories in the show, but there were a lot of story flaws. The background of certain transformers changed multiple time in order to sell a different toy. So, what is so wrong with these new movies. All they are doing are selling an action pack toy commercial. Who else better to get than a man who loves action like Micheal Bay. He wasn't brought in to make a movie about story, they wanted an action packed movie to sell toys to a new generation of kids. You can't expect Oscar movies from this type of idea. Most action movies are not Oscar type movies. I liked these movies because I knew what to expect, and they delivered what they promised, a big robot action movie.

I had heard that this new installment was not meant for kids.  I just thought because of the action it had, but it was as if they said ""We really didn't have enough mindless idiotic humor so let's throw as much as possible in on this one.""  Everything from two male dogs having intercourse to crude humor.  Just terrible stuff.  Stuff that I'd have to take the time to explain to my kids NOT to say, or explain why two male dogs are doing it.  And there's even a part where a small transformer is gyrating on Megan Fox's leg.  And she doesn't mind.  I'm not a fan of her either.  Even some of the shots of her are very suggestive.  Like I said this stuff really spoiled it for me and I won't be showing this to my nine year old.  As far as the concept.  Great story, Shia Lebouf is great in this one as well.  The action and effects are INCREDIBLE, but too many low class humor, really brought down the integrity of the movie's potential.

Too me, I'll forget this installment.  Actually, I did the same with Spiderman 3.  Just didn't hold up to the previous two.  This one doesn't equal the 1st.  So, in my book, there is only one true Transformers movie and that was the first.",1257724800,20,1342,4.270916334661354

Let me start off by saying that no-one is a bigger Michael Bay fan than I am, because this is going to get ugly and I want everyone to know that he is an amazing director. He just had this one slip up and it's called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

I have stood behind Bay on every one of his previous films including Armageddon and Pearl Harbor which I thought were amazing and have gotten so much criticism. Bay is notorious for putting things in his movies that would never happen in real life and when called out on it he will flat out admit to it. He likes to push the envelope of reality in order to make something look cool. But you can't blame him entirely because he knows his audience better than perhaps any director in Hollywood. You need only to look at the billions of dollars his films have grossed to see that. He knows what Middle America wants to see. Several people have told me that this movie was incredible and that they loved it and that it was better than the first one. I disagree entirely but there are so many people out there that just want to be visually entertained for two plus hours and take away nothing else from the film. I have had people tell me that they like to watch bright and shiny things go bang on the screen. If this is what you are looking for in a film, then Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is for you. Now on with the bashing.

The film opened very weak in comparison to Transformers. Optimus Prime's voice seemed dull and not as adventurous as it did when we first met him. Maybe he had already seen the movie when they had him narrate it.

I have heard rumors that Bay shot all of the action and CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) sequences months before there was even a script and then had the writers generate the rest of the story around those scenes. Is it true? Not sure.

I've got to tell you however, watching the film it looks like that's exactly what happened. And the writers are all very talented. He brought back the two who wrote the first film as well as another writer who has an incredible list of successful screenplays under his belt to include, Arlington Road and Reindeer Games just to name a few. And the two writers who wrote the first film also wrote the new Star Trek and Mission Impossible III. So you have to ask, how did this film get so horribly screwed up? Where was the witty dialogue and perfect comedic timing that the first film was engulfed with? Where was the cool story and plot and character development scenes? Who knows what happened.

I will say that it is filled with awesome action sequences and should undoubtedly win an Oscar for best special effects and at the very least be nominated for Oscars in sound and sound effects editing. But I feel like that's all the film had to offer and I'm sorry but that's just not enough. I don't care if it's just an action movie. It's because I'm such a huge fan of Michael Bay that I'm this disappointed. Luckily he promises to put more effort into the script of the third film.

The plot is nearly impossible to explain. It's everywhere all at once. Apparently the Transformers have been here for thousands of years and the leader of the bad guys (Decepticons), called The Fallen, was imprisoned in space. It makes you wonder if they called him The Fallen before he fell or if it's just been so long that perhaps they just forgot his real name. Anyhow, his buddies send Transformers out on missions to gather intelligence from our Military bases that apparently don't have very good security at all. They soon discover that Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has a shard of the cube left from the first film.

We learn that Sam is off to college without his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). I am amazed that this girl even made it into Hollywood. Next to Paris Hilton, she has to be the worst actress out there. I understand that she is attractive physically and that nine out of 10 guys would love to sleep with her. So many guys tell me ""She's hot dude."" So what if she's hot, she's a terrible actress! This is a huge movie and there are plenty of actresses who are 'hot' and can actually act! Hopefully her character will die early in the third film.

Sam is talking on the phone with her using very cheesy dialogue that is obviously pushing toward what is going to happen next, when a piece of the cube drops from the pocket of the sweatshirt he was wearing at his first Transformers encounter. He explains that he hasn't washed it because it's his lucky shirt, as lame as that is, thank God Shia LaBeouf is a great actor so it's tolerable. But then he drops the shard of the cube and it burns through the floor and the ceiling of the floor below and lands on a countertop and somehow can't melt through that. Then all of the metallic common household appliances come to life. They transform, so I guess we are supposed to believe that they are Transformers? But the Transformers are aliens so did the Witwickeys purchase all of their appliances from Mars? A huge firefight ensues and Sam is rescued by his Camaro that Transforms into Bumblebee.

Immediately following this scene, Sam tells Bumblebee he's leaving him at home because he is no longer in danger. I guess Sam must have suffered amnesia to not remember that he was just attacked by several little Transformers. And what kid in their right mind would leave behind a brand new Camaro, let alone one that's a Transformer?

Bay also shows Mikaela sitting on a motorcycle wearing the skimpiest outfit imaginable in a very provocative pose at her father's body shop. Maybe her dad was at lunch when she struck this unnatural pose? We also get to see Mikaela change her outfit to say goodbye to Sam which is really an excuse to just see her change her outfit. And then it isn't shown to us how exactly Mikaela ends up with the shard of the cube and later in the film Sam actually asks her if she has it, but she takes it with her and where does she put it? She brings it to the body shop which is comprised entirely of metal objects and not one of them turns into a Transformer, like Sam's appliances did. How does that add up?

This film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. At one moment it is filled with vulgarity, intense violence sequences, it shows two male dogs having sex with each other and Sam's mom even samples pot-filled brownies at his college and has some amusing side effects. While I was not offended by any of these moments in the film, I know that several parents were.

Then on the other hand, it is filled with all kinds of lame child-related humor as well. A lot of the Transformers are real slap-stick characters like the twins who I found to be annoying in every scene and the little voices that some of them have. A lot of the dialogue by the Transformers is child-like in nature as well. There's even a Transformer that is so old he has a beard made out of metallic shards and uses a piece of his body as a cane to get around. Come on, seriously?

He's a great actor, but they used the same guy that played the Colonel in the first film, (Glenn Morshower) to play a Four Star General in this one. He is working with the good Transformers (Auto Bots) in a special military unit. For some reason, despite the fact he is in charge of the project, he is allowed by a Major to speak with Optimus Prime, but can't see him directly. And Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) knows way more about the project than the General. So much in fact that he doesn't feel the need to call the General, Sir when speaking to him and is aware that the President has appointed a new civilian in charge of Commanding the Auto Bots. The General actually says, ""I guess I didn't get that memo."" I was in the military folks and I'm here to tell you that a Major would damn sure refer to a Four Star General as Sir or General and would have no knowledge of information regarding the President and his chief of Staff that the General would not. Wow.

Sam and Mikaela meet up with a really irritating kid who is supposed to be a comic relief that is Sam's roommate in college and the always funny and enjoyable John Turturro's character Simmons. They all set out to gain information from the very old Transformer mentioned previously. They are then transported by him miraculously to the pyramids in Egypt where the secret to their salvation is believed to be and the third act takes place. I glanced at the clock on my DVD player when watching this for the second time and the final action sequence was well over 30 minutes of non-stop action. Given the special effects were amazing and it was very fun to watch, it was just too much. It just kept going and going and going. It was about as relenting as watching a couple of kids play with the Transformers toys for over half an hour.

The Decepticons previous to all of this had captured Sam's parents who bring so much to the film. They really are hilarious and believable characters played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White. I guess the Decepticons had kidnapped them in hopes of trapping Sam in Egypt, but then they are just set loose. Maybe the Decepticons forgot about them due to the chaos of the rigorous 30 plus minute climax?

There are two huge moments in the film that were beyond the lamest of the lame. It's almost like everyone at the pitch meeting was yelling out ideas and then someone said, ""Hey, let's just use all of them!"" and then everyone agreed. Not to give too much away, one involves an idea that's been recycled a million times and takes place at Sam's dorm room with a pretty girl. How random was that? Once it's over it's never mentioned again. The second is Sam's destiny that's carried out at the climax. Why did he have to be the one to do this? A toddler could have been just as effective. After all of the other confusing and ridiculous moments in the film though, several of which I didn't even mention, these seem to fit with the rest pretty well.",1257724800,,10377,4.433892969569779

Aside from that, I can't even describe what happened in the movie. Did anything even happen? Or was it just a 2-1/2 hour fight scene? I have no idea. Even the special effects, which I saw in IMAX, ceased to be interesting after a while.

Megatron bows to no one except a planet eating Transformer called Unicron(80's animated movie)
and in that movie, HE STILL RESISTED BEING CONTROLLED. Total deviation from g1 character.
He could have atleast made him galvatron when they rebuilt him, I could have tolerated that.
Instead of a decent plot and lead to climactic battle, we get overdone jokes and lots of unneccesary scenes.
Devastator had a weak presence in the movie, he eats things, wow big whoop dee do.
Read the novel instead. Megatron acts more like Megatron, he doesn't care when the fallen is killed and he awakes the sleeping decepticon army.

Watching the mother act like a jerk and eat marijana induced brownies, a huge closeup of a man's butt wearing a speedo, dogs humping toys, themselves and the robot humping Megan Fox's leg.

3441314,2,B0019M5C0Q,"As someone who loved the first movie- and was fortune enough to snag it for a $1 after rebate on Blu-Ray (an absolute steal)- I was utterly disappointed by this sequel. Bigger budget, bigger robots, but a wholly inferior movie.

I saw it in IMAX, and in it, the scale of the movie is amazing. If you can turn off your brain- and I mean, flick the switch- for two hours, it's a fun ride.

The movie starts with Optimus narrating, explaining the Fallen. Plot setup, all good. We cut in to the army, getting ready to fight the deceptions. Rock music plays as N.E.S.T. (The government group responsible for working with the Autobots to keep the Earth safe) gets ready to drop into China. At this point of the movie, I was excited- it was fun.

We then cut to Sam getting ready for college. It's pretty boring stuff- we get a nice shot of Megan Fox detailing a motorcycle (she alleges that they were filming from both sides- eye candy is eye candy), but other than that, it's kind of the trite college scene you've seen in a million movies before. A piece of the Allspark (which was plunged into Megatron's chest- the little piece that the government found is locked up) falls out of Sam's shirt, and he sees some weird stuff. He drops it, the appliances go nuts. The house is destroyed, and Sam yells at Bumblebee, who inexplicably has once again lost the ability to talk.
From here on, the movie goes downhill. Sam gets to college, and we witness a bunch of campy/boring stuff. Sam's roommate- suprise- believes that the coverup of the events of the first movie are a conspiracy. Sam, of course, tells him to brush it off. Meanwhile, if you thought Sam's mom couldn't get any more awkward from the first movie, you're wrong- you get the treat of several minutes of the most awkward moments in cinema. Bravo if you want that, but isn't this movie about the autobots?
Moving along. Sam starts tripping out from the piece of the AllSpark and draws symbols. The Decepticons want him (knowledge he possesses from that piece) and begin wreaking havok. Unlike the first movie, there's no good fighting- the Autobots are on the run most of the time, and the scenes are so poorly paced that you can't tell who is fighting who, which side is winning, etc.
Additionally, the number of joke characters (see the twin robots) and immature jokes (John Turturro informs the army at one point that he is ""below the enemy's scrotum"") in this movie are appalling.
The ending battle is an incoherent, frenzied scene, during which you can barely tell what's going on. And after all that, the autobots win the battle in two minutes. Fin.

The first movie, despite its flaws, had a decent plot. And while it had a little bit less robot fighting than I would like, the fight scenes in the movie were fun to watch and the viewer could tell who was fighting who.

My recommendation would be a rental/on demand. Visually, the movie is gorgeous in 1080P, but it's not a good movie.",1257638400,14,2950,4.537593984962406

I went by myself to watch this at the theaters, and I heard one of the mothers of 3 kids complaining it was a very immature movie.
Shame on Micheal Bay, for making such a crappy film, with such crappy actors, and a crappy plot.

I realize that the bots are made up of complex machinery. This is fantasy right? Well someone with an engineering degree and too little imagination decided we needed to see every hose and gear it takes to make one of these things move. Ok, fine. Now throw in high speed jittery movie motion and a pathetically weak plot and WHAM whoosh you have Transformers Revenge of the fallen.

An example of great character robots that show minimal mechanization are the 2 in Wall-E. Wall-E you can imagine the mechanics behind it, and Eve has no connecting devices at all, yet both of these characters are loveable and we can empathize with them. You do not need to show umpteen million wires, hoses et al. Look at the original cartoons for Transformers, they made it all work with minimal details.

I honestly think they need to refund everyone their money back. Do NOT buy this movie, instead rent it and turn it off when the motion gets too out of hand, which it does so often you wonder if they have even heard of a steady-cam in Hollywood these days.

Pros:
>> Nice box

Cons:
<< Unimaginative use of detail - go to art school and learn a little about minimalism k?

What was the deal with the two wisecracking, cursing Transformers? It was like they were stuck in the movie just to prove the movie isn't for kids. Robots talking in slang and with accents is ridiculous to me. If this kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then you'll like the movie a lot more than I did. Some of the CGI is obvious and not quite realistic, but other parts of the CGI look pretty cool. Unlike a lot of people who hate on this movie I don't blame Shia for me not liking it. I don't like the script. My problem isn't with the actors. SPOILER AHEAD: there is a scene with a human dying and talking with the ghosts of Primes past. That was a bit too silly for me too. You put both of your heroes on their deathbeds in separate scenes of the same movie only to have neither one die. That's just a bit too corny for me.

3441326,3,B0019M5C0Q,"First, do an Internet video search for ""Michael Bay explosions"" and watch the video you get, a gem from Seth Green and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot-Chicken/dp/B000E0OE3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot Chicken</a>.  The only real difference from this video and this fun little over-the-top CGI-fest is that the movie goes on for an additional two hours.

Synopsis: Bad AGRs (alien giant robots) are mad at good AGRs, and mad at a few choice humans, too, and they all duke it out all over our little planet, destroying lots of landmarks in very, very loud and visually cool ways.

Of course, my 11-year-old son loved this thing, all the way through.  He pronounced it much better than the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-movie/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers movie</a>, and I have to agree with him, as I sat through that one, and gave up on it after about thirty minutes.

From the first minutes, you get high-tech military ops, explosions, cool flying debris, massive and gratifying Hollywood movie explosion fireballs, chases, and CGI action so fast and so intricate and that you've got to put the DVD player on slo-mo to actually see all the work that the F/X geeks put into the scenes.  Never mind the ridiculous opening premise of the Chinese government allowing a full-blown American (there are a couple of Brit allies, in the thinnest sliver of a nod to multilateralism) military combat op to take place on their soil.

This film is a nonstop raging orgy of military hardware, reeeeeally close to but not quite a two-hour commercial for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/US-Air-Force/dp/0883631148/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">US Air Force</a>, with a little bit of Army and Marines thrown in to, you know, actually close with the enemy and hold the objective.  It sure looks to me like the Navy didn't want to play in the film, as there's an extended scene of an aircraft carrier being blasted apart by the bad AGRs, sailors and all of their really cool hardware--wait for it--yes--exploding and going down.  Like we got in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001GAPC1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>, there are a lot of USAF air-power goodies, with the C-17 and F-22 featuring prominently and early, F-16s, A-10s, the Predator, then the B1 bomber.  We even get the classic SR-71, but sadly not flying.  The only thing we didn't get was the 117 or the B2, or a Global Hawk.  The Army and Marines throw in some BFVs, Abrams and MLRS, and of course there are tons of Blackhawk helicopters.  And everything shoots stuff, stuff that blows up!

All of that gear, and then some, is thrown at the bad AGRs, and they throw more than their share back, in very active and deadly combat.  But, we never, ever, see anybody dead or dying, other than the robots.  There is no blood, no reality of the literally tens of thousands who get killed over the course of this film.  While not as egregious as the glossing over the hundreds of millions killed in that awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow/dp/B000VDDWE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow</a>, or the billions who are sure to die in the upcoming ""2012"" disaster-fest, it's something like irresponsible to just waste thousands of folks in crystal-clear CGI while being so thoroughly removed from the true, horrific nature of it.

And because it's a Michael Bay film, you've got lots of slo-mo American flags fluttering in pure rippling jingoistic splendor.  This is awesomely crafted pandering for the never-been-past-the-state-line audience at home, but I can't help but see it as just another reason for the other 5.7 billion people on the planet to think we're arrogant jerks.

I enjoyed the character of National Security Advisor Galloway as a pure and unapologetic lambasting of SecDef Rumsfeld, right down to the iconic specs.  He gets his, eventually, of course.  The only screwy part of this, is when he charges in to take over, he's got a warrant from the President, who is named once as President Obama.  This indirectly makes Obama look like a fool for appointing him, while it's the moron Bush Republican administration that apparently is the target.

I love to watch John Turturro, although sitting through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Don-t-Mess-With-the-Zohan/dp/B001DPHDB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Don't Mess With the Zohan</a>&nbsp;really was pretty difficult.  His reprised role as Agent Simmons allows him to be spastic, crazy, and get all weird, a great character and a perfect fit for the film.

Camaro-bot comes across as sad, a developmentally challenged autobot.  He's a good guy, sure, but he's more like a V-8 golden retriever.

Flick and Flack, or Zap and Zop, whatever the hell the two twin robots are called were hard to see as anything but annoying, contributing almost nothing to the story but idiotic wisecracks during the slow parts.  Why, yes, their characters and dialog were offensive, despite what the producers have said.  You'd think sophisticated entertainment professionals would have been smart enough to realize that this kind of portrayal isn't quite the thing to do anymore.  The movie could do without these two.

And the illustrious Miss Megan Fox: Sorry, but all I could see of this Ultra-Hottie Of The Moment was a deep spray-on tan and many layers of industrial-grade lipstick.  Early in the film she comes across as nothing but trashy, and later she's nothing but makeup, with delicate smudges to make it appear she's actually been doing something.  She's pretty, sure, but not the greatest thing since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jill-St-John/dp/B001SV58MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jill St. John</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raquel-Welch/dp/B001DRUDYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raquel Welch</a>.

Of course, dead isn't really dead.  Just like the first film, folks die but they don't really die.  It's just, y'know, an illusion, so easily rectified with a magic liquid/crystal/gem,  mystical knowledge, extraterrestrial power, that kind of too-easily crafted and lame gimmick.

Bottom Line: Hey, this is a US blockbuster, so it's all lowest common denominator.  You can't expect depth of character, logical story, normal people, normal situations, or subtlety of story or expression.  But, buddy, You CAN expect massive CGI-rendered physical destruction, action, gunplay, chases, and tons of weapons, gadgets and technology, a hot chick or two, MTV-style editing and a soundtrack that will rattle your fillings, and this film delivers a surplus of all.",1257292800,12,6940,5.8316831683168315

There are too many similarities between the first and second Transformer movies to contain in one review.

I knocked off a star for the film having too many extraneous characters, like the cyborg babe and the nitwit roomie, but I got a kick out of the little ""turncoat"" Decepticon robot with the guy from Spongebob doing a spot-on Steve Buscemi impression for its voice.

Infact I was hoping they would kill off the whole Witwicky family so I wouldn't have to ever deal with those annoying trying to be funny but not so funny scenes.  I'll admit Shia LaBeouf was less annoying in this movie than the last one, but I still couldn't give a crap. Megan Fox is eye candy and nothing else and every time she was in a scene my girlfriend would give me an evil look and poke me with her soda straw, so I couldn't even enjoy that.

3441336,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Yes, I thought the first Michael Bay Transformers was bad. I wasn't expecting the sequel to be much better, but in the back of my mind I was hoping. Michael Bay apparently decided there wasn't enough crass humor, overt sexuality, poor character development, useless moving parts, explosions, and nameless robots transforming into formless metallic amoebas in the first movie. So now there is more of all that in this one. Of course, it doesn't make the movie better, just longer.

Negatives:
1) The twins. I don't think I need to explain this.
2) Sam's parents, excessive comic relief, no importance to the story.
3) Mikaela and the Decepticon fem-bot. Ok, I'm a male, yes I think Meghan Fox is hot. I personally, do not mind seeing her wearing skimpy revealing clothes. But come on, give her some depth. First of all, this movie is being used to sell toys to 6-year-olds. There is no need for such overt female objectification in this movie. Seriously, she spends most of the movie with that pouty expression and posing seductively, instead of acting. Same complaint with the ""fem-bot"", I felt it was completely unnecessary to the story.
4) Everyone is comic relief. Ok, I'm all for comic relief in action movies. But seriously, you can't build an action movie around an entire cast of comedians. More than 3 comic relief characters, and you should call it ""Giant Robot Movie"" (ie. Scary Movie series).
5) Visual effects. Sometimes less is more. The robots are too complex, too many moving parts. It is very hard to follow the action trying to follow these overly detailed monochromatic machines as they fly through cities causing random destruction everywhere. In the original cartoon, the simpler designs were easier to identify and they were distinctively color-coded. Most of the Decepticons look the same.
6) There are no rules. Basically, Michael Bay is telling us that alien robots can do whatever they please. They can change their alt-forms at will or become giant robo-amoebas. If you hack them to pieces, each part can become a completely new Transformer. Robots can transform into people. Mechanical devices can turn into dust, communicate telepathically with humans, then reform themselves from said dust and resurrect dead Transformers. And other mechanical devices or even a tiny piece of them can turn earth machines into robots (complete with machine-guns) or resurrect Transformers.
7) Questionable motivations on both sides. So at the end of episode 1, this autobot declared he would stay with Sam forever and ever. Ah, how touching. Now Sam decides to go to college and he won't take Bumblebee with him. What a jerk. He saved the world once, but now Optimus Prime asks for his help to do it again, and college is more important. Why does Sam give the All-Spark sliver to his unrealistically hot girlfriend for safe-keeping, instead of Bumblebee, Optimus or any of those government guys? Why do the Decepticons want to destroy the sun? I mean really, Cybertron is supposedly destroyed, do they have another planet to inhabit once this solar system is wiped out?

Positives:
1) Peter Cullen and Frank Welker
2) Explosions

Neutral:
1) The battle with Optimus Prime in the woods was really cool, but it didn't have nearly the emotional impact of the animated movie from the 80's because it was decided early on that they could just resurrect him before the end of the movie. And with no ""Hot Rod"" character, Sam's episode of feeling guilty seemed pretty shallow.

All in all, a terrible movie from a critical point of view. People will like the movie if they are a big fan of loud booms and not optional things like story. I feel guilty spending money on this disaster, though.",1256947200,161,3695,4.89776357827476
3441337,2,B0019M5C0Q,"If my headliner sounds like I don't like the movie, that's not the case. I came out of the movie super pumped and eager to buy lots of small plastic robots that will probably end up in a cardboard box in the attic in a few months, because there was plenty of fun stuff in the movie. However, overall there were a lot of questionable storytelling choices in this movie, and I think that this is a prime example of what kinds of effects the writers' strike had. The plot of this movie is very unfocused, constantly jumping from one location to another, but it feels more like a really long car ride than it does a rollercoaster. There's lots of scenes in this movie that simply aren't necessary. This movie should have been about 30 minutes shorter, and most of it could have been taken out of the stupid college campus scenes, the bathroom / sex humor, Skids and Mudflap's zany antics, and several rather useless and unnecessary plot devices.

There is a good movie hidden somewhere in Transformers 2, underneath the layers and layers of unnecessary trash. As it is it's a fun movie, but it goes on way longer than it should and has a lot of humor content that is downright inappropriate for the kids that the movie is largely meant for. It's not terrible, but it's not nearly as good as the first one. Hopefully a skilled fan editor will take a hard look at this movie and cut out the schlock and let the good stuff shine through, giving us a movie that truly does feel like an extension of the first Transformers movie.",1256947200,2,1520,4.428571428571429

Not so much this time.

Once I got to the part with the fighting in the desert I felt an unwelcome sense of deja-vu. In addition, all the action scenes came across as a hidden military recruitment message: Here comes the AIR FORCE with their UAVs, jets and bombers!!!
Here comes the ARMY with their tanks and helicopters!!!
Here comes the NAVY with their cruisers and submarines!!!
Uncle Sam wants YOU!!!

I'm surprised recruitment phone numbers didn't appear on the credits.

As for the other parts of the movie, the whole ""When to say the ""L"" word"" was really cheesy and primitive. The college scenes were more of the same we've all seen before.

The special effects, of course, are top notch, and I bet it was a headache getting those Transformers to move with all those intricate parts.

So far it seems like the consensus is that there is one good Transformers movie (the last one) and one not-so-good one (this one). Let's hope that the creators of this series heed the Japanese Proverb:

""FALL down seven times. STAND up eight.""",1256860800,,1182,4.764705882352941

- The robot fighting scenes are much easier to see than those of the previous movie. Here, I can clearly see who is fighting against whom. Or who is being beaten up.

- The action is non-stop.

- The picture is colorful.

- Meegan Fox is irresistibly sexy.

- It has less funny scenes than the first movie.

I can stand, and even enjoy, a non-stop action movie for around 1:45, but 2:30 of that with hardly any attempt at a story?  No way, too much for me!  The four adults in our group were all just worn out by the end, no enjoyment at all.  One toddler (who can usually sit thru most movies no problem) was bored well before it ended.  Three teen-aged boys all loved it, though even they admitted there was no real story and they just liked all the action and special effects.  The two girls with us weren't too interested.  For what it's worth, none of us parents really thought the sexual innuendo was really that much, especially after reading criticism of it.  BTW, we all liked the first one.  I probably liked it less than the rest, but even though I never was into the Transformers as a kid, and thought the dialogue was really hokey, I did like it quite a bit and did buy it.

And one over emphasized facets that just really bugged me in this film; every, I mean every girl in this movie was of model appearance. The stand ins, background and fillers were young, long hairs, tan girls.  Which we all like in proportion, but damn... if that's all there is as a standard, beauty starts to reverse itself.  Even if one contends this was to be about ""eye candy,"" eye candy becomes anything but if it is overplayed.

It's possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and just thinking about it makes me tired. All I can say with honesty is that you should avoid this movie entirely. To sum up the entire movie in a sentence: ""It's all flash and no substance."" It looks great, but that's where the good ends. The story is hackneyed, the plot and pacing is terrible, the characters are quite literally walking stereotypes with no depth at all. It's just awful.

3441348,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The first movie had its fun moments with cool action packed sequences and over the top special effects. When it was released on Blu-Ray, it became a reference title for audio and video quality, presentation and special features.

Its sequel continues the tradition of being an amazing Blu-Ray worthy of praise for its technical achievements, but the story itself and the pace of the movie are not on par with the original.

The movie tries too hard, it is over saturated with effects (amazing but hard to follow at times) and competes with Star Wars (prequel trilogy) for most annoying CGI character (Jar-Jar still wins in my book, but it was close) by introducing the ""autobot twins"".

Overall, Transformers is supposed to be a jaw dropping popcorn flick and does succeed on that however, there are far better and much more cohesive examples of its kind (Armageddon and The Rock for instance).

If you like watching Megan Fox, enjoy the latest of visual effects and killer audio tracks, then you'll certainly have your fun with this one. The presentation of this Blu-Ray is worthy of every praise as is the technical achievement of the movie itself.  Don't expect a decent well paced story or a good example of sci-fi though.",1256688000,3,1226,4.819047619047619
3441349,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Transformers Two is one of the worst sequels in recent memory and remains as one of the worst pictures I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Spielberg,Bay and company should be ashamed of this overly complicated,long and generally shoddy product they hoisted on an eagerly awaiting public. The first movie in this franchise was superb;the right amount of action with a very credible plot and great special effects. This movie takes all that that was built on and essentially trashes it.
Shia Lebeouf returns as Sam,as his friend Optimus Prime continues his fight to eliminate the Decpeticon threat throughout the world(and in space).Sam discovers a piece of the Allspark in his house which melts through the floor to bring to life all the appliances in his house,wreaking alot of unwanted havoc. Optimus approaches Sam saying that the Decepticons are amassing again and the time has come that he needs his help. Sam,incredulously considering all that has past in the first movie,refuses to help!!He's off to college and can't be bothered??? Sam,in keeping with all that has gone on,should have been right there,no questions. This illogical plot thread creates a rift from which the movie never recovers.
Sam goes to college but the inevitable conflict follows him,much to his chagrin(what did he really expect?).In fact he does everything to avoid getting involved. His roommates we discover even run an internet alien conspiracy theory site;how convenient! The fight eventually engulfs Sam and his girlfriend who have no choice but to join Optimus and company in their fight against the Decepticons. Their journey goes worldwide and Megatron is(of course) released and in turn releases the Fallen,the evil head of the Decepticons. In the end it is a dual to the death and just as we think Optimus and Sam are no more a material called the Matrix comes into the picture and with the help of ancient Primes Sam is sent back to bring Optimus back to life to finally defeat the evil horde.
This is just a tip of the iceberg breakdown of the plot,because it is a long,ponderous and over complicated thing that I could never do justice to anyway;nor is it WORTH repeating or trying to do justice to(may I recommend a look at [...],to see just how complicated it really is).One autobot we are intro'd to is a souped up ice cream truck which turns into two ""homeys"" at will who constantly argue over nothing and are there for supposed ""comic relief"" but offer nothing but annoyance.
At 143 minutes this special effects driven leviathan slowly weaves its' way along and doesn't really get moving until the last 20 minutes or so,and by then everything is anti-climactic and you are just wishing the whole mess a speedy and quick ending.
This two DVD set contains featurettes,deleted and alternate scenes and a music video by Linkin Park. The film has been transferred beautifully and the sound as A-1. However it is like trying to dress up a corpse;there is no life here so why bother.
This movie goes on my all time Turkey list for two reasons:what the film IS and for what it SHOULD have been. Unless the next one can dig itself out from under this massive failure somehow,this might have essentially killed the franchise in just two pictures. The producers lost sight of the ball big time and the proof is painfully here for all to see. But I recommend you save your money and DON'T!",1256688000,13,3390,4.836488812392427

For example, I would give this movie two stars for it's CG effects. However, I would remove one star for excessive redundant and visually too-fast-for-appreciation CG effects. I would remove one star for a rambling poorly constructed and not very creative plot. I would remove one star for rote stereotypic read-the-script acting. Then remove a star for a formula script. And, as most everyone else has stated, remove another star for writers & directors not knowing their target audience. Finally, remove two more stars for language appropriate only for 17 to 19 year olds and sexual innuendo appropriate for never-got-around-to-growing-up adults.

3441353,4,B0019M5C0Q,"First off, if you weren't a big fan of the first movie, you're not going to like the second.  That being said, I thought this installment was pretty good.  The first one is one of my favorites, which totally shocked me as I hadn't expected much. This one had too much sexual inuendo, the first film was softer on that score, which I liked much better.  Gutter type humor, in placed that didn't fit or was appropriate.  It did run longer then was necessary.  All in all, the story was ok, the acting good, Fox did a better job in the first film though.  They sexed her up over the top in this one...not a good idea.  This isn't a T&A film, lose the idea. The action was tight and well paced.  There were spots where it slowed down, necessary I think.  Too much action all the time can really be taxing and turn people off. Enough drama; I thought the ""I love you"" subplot was REALLY subplot, you didn't really notice it as being annoying.  They are teenagers after all and saying I love you the first time is a tough thing, at any age really.
I would recommend this to most people.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of some of the issues I listed above, but also becasue I didn't think it was as tight overall as the first film.  They got somewhat sloppy on this one. The ending was too abrupt, as well.  Hope they fix some of the issues and make a stellar 3rd film!  =)",1256601600,2,1369,4.175572519083969

I knew going in that this wasn't going to teach me anything or tell some deep ideas that would make me look at life differently. This is the kind of movie where you can leave your brain on the floor and enjoy pure entertainment. I had tons of fun seeing this movie with a large crowd. It's one of the few times that I've seen people scream and laugh at the screen, everyone having a fun time together. But I can't give this movie five stars due to the plot. The overall plot is fine. It's epic and great, but the way it's cut together isn't. There are so many plot holes in this movie that it's not even funny. I won't explain any of them here because I don't want to spoil anything of the little plot that there is. Personally, I think that if they would have kept the same plot but took the time to really flesh it out the movie would have been better.  I'm hoping that they can create a much better plot driven/character movie for the third one. That what was great about the first one, it was character driven, thus a lot more enjoyable.",1256601600,,1167,4.1866666666666665
3441355,3,B0019M5C0Q,"First and foremost I really enjoyed the first transformers. Even tho that film was also flawed it still wound up being an excellent summer popcorn action flick. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the sequel. The biggest problem I have with this film is its running time. Michael Bay just doesn't seem to understand that out of all of the films that end up running over 2 hours, VERY FEW are summer action films. Thats because it takes a great story with exceptional performances to keep people interested that long and I am sorry to say Transformers is not one of those films. There is absolutely NO reason why this film couldn't have been made in under 2 hours. In fact if you were to get rid of a lot of the scenes that don't need to be there and shorten a few of the battle scenes, this film could easily have come in around the 1 hour 40 minute mark.

This shortening of the film would have had a positive ripple effect throughout the entire film as your not only making the film a better length, your also getting rid of a lot of the scenes that hurt the quality of this film. Some of the scenes that immediately come to mind are the one involving the parents. I actually enjoyed the role they played in the first film but they were just annoying in the sequel. For example, the entire eating of the pot brownies scene on campus. It does absolutely NOTHING to further the plot and was obnoxious. Again I enjoyed them in the first film but they were nothing short of annoying in this film.

Another problem with this film is it had some action scenes that went on WAY to long. For example at the end of the film when Shia LaBeouf is trying to get to Optimus with the dust. I swear it took him at least 30 minutes to get there. That entire sequence just dragged on and on and on. Yes it had some very cool action scenes in it and they could have kept all of them and still shortened it DRAMATICALLY. This problem of having too long of a running time is not a new problem for Michael Bay. Almost every film this guy makes is too long. I am not sure what the problem is, if he is just a terrible editor or he has such an ego that he doesn't want to leave anything on the cutting room floor. Whatever the reason this is hands down one of his biggest problems as a director. The bottom line, these kinds of action films should never run above an 1:40. It just kills the pacing of the film and ultimately hurts the overall quality of the film and this film is a perfect example of just that.

On a positive note we were given some fantastic action scenes that weren't just a mess of close ups like we had in the first film.. This time we get some wide angle shots that clearly show the action taking place in the shots. In particular the fight in the forest that ultimately saw Optimus taken down was amazing. I also think the story as whole was fairly interesting. I liked the entire back story of how the Decepticons had been here before and how they left behind the ancients that were looking for the key. I really didn't have a problem with anything regarding the overall story and this is why I ultimately gave this a 3 star rating. I think this film had a lot potential, it was unfortunately just squandered by Bay.

Now I perfectly understand the argument that most fans are throwing out there. This is a summer popcorn film. We shouldn't expect Oscar worthy performances or Oscar worthy writing. Well in all honesty I wasn't and my biggest problems with this film aren't even connected to those aspects of the film. Again my biggest problems deal with length, pacing, and leaving in scenes that should have been cut not only due to length but also due to quality. Because of these problems this wound up being an average action film and that really is a shame as it could have been so much more. At this point the studio should give Michael Bay an ultimatum, Bring the next film in under 1:50 or we are getting a new director. Again I don't know what it is about Bay that makes him incapable of making films under 2 hours and to be honest I really don't care anymore. This series still has a lot of potential and as long as Bay continues to make these into epic length films, that potential will never be realized.

I will admit that I think a lot of people are being a bit harsh in regards to scoring this film as there is no way this film deserves a 1 star rating. I honestly believe that most of the people that have given it a 1 star rating did so not because they actually think it deserves a 1 star rating, they did it because they are upset with Bay for blowing this film and the best way to show that is by giving it a 1 star rating. While I don't agree with such methods, I can at least understand the frustration. This could have been a much better film. All he had to do was cut the film differently, bring down the running time to 1:40 or 1:50 and I honestly believe it could have been a much better film. As is its just a mediocre film that goes on way too long.

The transformations were pretty cool.  Some funny parts - the small robot that is kidnapped and then switches sides.  And there were a couple of twists that weren't expected.

I was hoping they would have done more with the roommate character.  The mother character was pretty funny when they were at home.  But the escapades at the college weren't believable - tiresome - reminded me of old frat house humor.

Another change from the earlier movie - I felt like I was watching some sort of a playboy shoot - they couldn't just show megan fox as a female action hero, she was intentionally posed in these ridiculous positions.

The people who made this film should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. This was disgraceful at how mindless and awful it was. But, with Michael Bay on board, I could have seen this coming. The only thing more pathetic about how awful this film is, is that people went to see the movie, and they'll probably buy the dvd.

3441366,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Stuff like this makes me grateful that Rifftrax were made available to the public.

So this move can be summed up as thus: Twilight for guys.

Rather than terrible romance, we get Explosions! Lots of explosions! Lots of running and screaming!  Talking very quickly! *sigh* I was asking if the movie was over twenty minutes in.

So, this film also rather obviously lacks a plot of any sort. There's something about a key and decepti-whatnots winning if it falls into their hands... and that's about all I got in between the explosions. There are absolutely no original, sympathetic, interesting or snarky characters. Actually, I don't think there are any actual characters at all. Just terrible cliches and  some of the worst racial stereotypes I've ever seen in recent film. I don't remember any character names at all. They were that forgettable.

Well since I've mentioned it a few times, I might as well address the main portion of the film: explosions and robot fight scenes.

Now I like a good explosion as much as the next person. I can snicker with glee as well as any Mythbuster whilst contemplating blowing up some random inanimate object (for science!). However, I appreciate explosions more when there is some context put around them besides ""I shot a rocket at it."" Speaking of rockets,  what idiot fires bullets at machinery when there are rocket launchers available? A shoulder mounted rocket launcher is used exactly one time in the entire two and half hours of the film. This seems more than a little silly to me.

Then the fight scenes... oh the fight scenes. I like a good robot fight scene. I love Macross and its mecha. I love the bot fights in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Those are well animated, well choreographed, put in context and fun to watch. Revenge of the Fallen's robot fight scenes were not fun to watch. They look like someone shot two Erector sets at each other from air cannons and filmed the resulting impact. While Freud would likely say that I was right on target with the example, visually these scenes were not helped by a low contrast between robots versus robots and robots and the background. I don't care how detailed those computer models are, it doesn't compensate for poor design, poor camera work and poor set up. The visuals gave me a headache and the non-existent story did not make suffering through the bad fight scenes worthwhile.

This movie had exactly one redeeming value to it though. I knitted a foot of scarf while putting up with it.",1256342400,,2506,4.740229885057471

What did you think?"" If I get a response that is positive in any way, I know immediately that I need not concern myself with that person's opinion on anything entertainment related.

I grew up watching the Transformers cartoons, while not a die-hard geek about them, I was excited to see the first Transformers movie in live action. While it could have been much better, I enjoyed seeing Optimus on the big screen and that was really enough for me to overlook the first's shortcomings. For that reason alone, I decided to watch T2:RotF on Blu-ray. I have never watched a movie and been so confused as to what was supposed to be happening at any giving moment. Plot holes are so plentiful, it is a bit laughable that this is supposed to be a finished product. The editing, art direction,screenplay, and writing are all atrocious and I am being generous.

I don't understand how Steven Spielberg could have allowed his name to be attached to this monstrosity and Michael Bay should never be given any job directing any other movie ever. He is by definition, a hack. This is the perfect example of everything wrong with Hollywood and it's blockbuster approach to movie making. Throw money, explosions, and a Huge marketing budget into the movie, but absolutely no thought into the creation of it.

The special effects are mind-boggling, the action non-stop, the cast strong and Megan Fox irresistible. I also enjoyed the intermittent comedic sequences that added a nice change of pace. Sam's Mom wandering around campus with the ""tainted"" brownies was classic. There are numerous reviews that lament over a weak plot but I disagree completely with such a suggestion. I loved the way they amalgamated various aspects of New Age beliefs with a Christian apocalyptic vision, replacing demonic entities with intergalactic Decepticons descending upon the Earth to finish an ages old battle on the Giza plateau. Indeed a glorious, mechanized Armageddon!

Definitely lots of fun here. The one thing I question about 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is the language and sexual references liberally sprinkled throughout the film.

Revenge of the Fallen was just that a character called the Fallen is introduced as Megatron's master & decides now is the time to take over.
They missed the target on this one. Too much toilet, bathroom and pointless vulgar language and humor to start off..characters that were just plain stupid...Autobots that had no name and had ghetto humor. Robots that were not even part of the TV series...boy what went wrong here (everything basically)...
I cant believe just how bad this was..Fallen is the key word...Fallen from the great heights from the first picture to this lousy sequel.
I have no idea what made Michael Bay decide to go for bathroom humor, closeups of a man's fatty butt, a character walking around with his pants down , endless scenes of Megan Fox' boobie cleavage, and a pointless ""I love you"" subplot that went nowhere at all. I mean really, if you love someone tell them - don't play the battle of wills. Is that how Bay sees relationships - who gives in to who ? Do you wait until someone dies until you say 'I love you I need you' and endless pour your heart out dribble ? Bleck !!
This was also overlong running at 2 1/2 hours with endless scenes of the cast running around Egypt looking for signs to find the Matrix of Leadership (which in the cartoon Optimus already has this in his chest) I was waiting for a Transformer Mummy to come out. Take the worst out of the Mummy Series and National Treasure & National Lampoon them with robots and this is what you get..
The action was okay - good, but explosions , SPFX , more robots with 'cool' (uncool) dialog do not replace a movie filled with holes, lousy toilet humor and just utter tedium in Egypt....
On top of that Rainn Wilsons parents were everything out of a nightmare. What kind of parents are these two ? Who came up with their asinine lines. The mother was just horrible with her dialog. And they kept popping up out of nowhere as did characters - just popping up out of nowhere, half the time I was asking where did this person come from...this made me want to watch the cartoon which at least were classier than this and had a more serious tone than this..
As much as I like Transformers & being a fan for over 2 decades this movie was a car wreck..this would make a great Rifftrax or Cinematic Titanic title (for those who are MST3K fans)
It really was that bad, and yet, you really want to root for Optimus Prime, you want to like him, but the film won't let you. Or you will like Prime but nothing else.
I know Transformers 3 is in the works..I hope Michael Bay & company decide to re-watch the first one to see that formula.

I loved the movie, it had a little bit of everything... explosions, an attractive leading actress (I have a hard time using the word ""lady"" regarding the ball of self-importance and stupidity that is Megan Fox), lots of eye candy for the women (Can you say Josh Duhamel??), humor and some of the best CGI I've ever seen!

More action? Yea.

But the movie SUCKED. I had read the reviews before I bought it, but, I know my opinion isn't necessarily the same as anyone else.
Please don't take just my word for it. Read the other reviews.

This movie developed the relationship of Sam and Mikaela, which was to be expected. But they even screwed that up.

Ironhide, a major character in the first movie, BARELY made it on to the screen for this movie.

And they had some very immature/lame jokes. Such as..

1) The little robot who was humping Mikaela's leg.
2) Same little robot would 'fart' every so often, as indicated by the 'flame' coming from his behind.
3) Devastator (Constructicons combine to make one big robot) had a scrotum.
4) Agent Simmons claiming ""This is top secret. Do not tell my mother.""
5) There was this new character. Sam's college roommate. More than once talked about how he got his testicles hurt. Yea, I know it hurts, but did not add anything to movie.

And those are just the jokes that I can think of off the top of my head. I am sure there are more I can't think of.

Also, if you are fan of the original G1 cartoon series like me, you'll remember the character of Arcee, the 'girl' Transformer.
In this flick, there are the ""Arcee Twins"". Motorcycles that transform, and have holographic girls riding. That is just wrong.

But it was also your typical Michael Bay summer blockbuster with mediocre acting, weak plot and stock dialogue.  So obviously I wasn't expecting too much with this, but I thought it might be a small step above the first, or at least on par with it.  But no, this film took a significant step down and should really ruin Michael Bay's already worthless reputation.

To begin, the film was just a huge commercial for Chevy, Mountain Dew, and the soundtrack featuring all the latest and trendiest hits from Green Day, Linkin Park, and Nickelback.  Megan Fox's character was even more worthless than she was in the first film, and they really went out of their way to emphasize her hotness.  I also couldn't stand the 2 new Autobot ""twins,"" Mudflap and Skids.  Not only are these robots shamelessly plugging more Chevy cars (the Trax and Beat), but they also talk like black crackheads straight from the hood.  One of them even has a gold ""tooth,"" and they curse excessively.  I mean how ridiculous is that!?  The movie was full of silliness that was both immature and random.  In one scene, Sam's mom eats a hash brownie by mistake and runs a rampage through the college campus and tackles a student.  At one point Bumblebee cries like a little girl with a skinned knee.  There's also about 4 or 5 scenes with the dog-humping-the-leg joke...how mature.  It's like the movie was made by 5-year-olds, except that it's not appropriate for 5-year-olds.  Finally, the story has more holes than Swiss cheese.  At the end of the first film, Bumblebee's voice finally came back, but it's still broken throughout this entire movie.  And how did the Autobots drive from America to Egypt in a day?  And if the Fallen was in space all this time, what was he doing while Megatron was frozen for hundreds of years?  Many fans complained in the first film that Optimus Prime didn't show up until halfway in, and guess what, they take him out of half the film again!  This movie was just an absolute mess and I felt a little dumber after watching it.  The only redeeming qualities were a couple of decent fight scenes.",1256169600,11,2277,4.57037037037037

I viewed the movie on a Samsung Series 8 LED TV (which is a stellar display I might add) and the images really do pop out (even more so with Auto Motion Plus 240Hz turned on)!! Needless to say, this movie will look and sound amazing with capable components and the proper setup.

The storyline is okay in my opinion. Yeah we can debate that aspect all day, but that's not what this movie is about. It really is ALL flash, and thin on substance. Instead of Unicron and Galvatron we get the Fallen as the main antagonist in the sequel. Also, I was disappointed with the movie's version of Devastator (who was quite useless).

There was so much robot action, I found myself anxiously awaiting the next human to appear on screen. I know this is the trend of movies to be non-stop, no breathing room stories, but at times the action was so intense, the movement on screen so fast that I had to look away. The saving grace for me was the scenes with the human characters.

Megan Fox is the hottest babe on the planet right now, and there is nothing in this movie to take away from that. To some (including herself), her part here was just eye candy, but I see in all of that hot chick stuff that the girl really has talent, if she can exploit it.

Shia LaBeouf is a very likable character in this one, as he was in Indiana Jones. A quite capable actor with a lot going for him. He does an outstanding job.

I loved the mom and dad. They made all the robot action come to a screeching halt with their typical American family banter. They had some of the funniest scenes in there.

Glenn Morshower, the bodyguard from 24, is a favorite. He is perfect as the general (especially using his real name [General Morshower]) and I could hardly wait for him to give an order, or make a wisecrack.

The rest of the actors handled their parts very well, especially John Turturro.

I can't forget Josh Duhamel. He is a favorite of mine, yet in this movie, he is so buried in the scenes that he rarely gets to show his great talents as an actor. I came away wishing they'd given him more dialogue instead of having him constantly ducking for cover.

The most annoying thing was those two ""ghetto boy"" robots. A pair of Jar Jar Binks'. I can see why people were upset with them as they seemed to stab at every stereotype imaginable. Yet, in a way they had their moments. If they were supposed to be comic relief, Mr. Bay could've come up with a much better idea.

As far as the plot goes, just another good versus evil battle with plenty of holes, but who cares?

Overall, this movie was mostly a fun ride, but in a way, it is the perfect excuse for a migraine unless you have a pause button. A bit too much action, and not enough breathing.

It's a wonderful combination of Action, SciFi-and War Movie all rolled into one staggeringly visual film that's bigger, brighter and more destructive than the first movie. Human beings (a lot of them: over 7,000) were clearly depicted as being killed in this film so it leaves the world of comics behind and enters into real bad-ass SciFi movie territory along with Independence Day, War Of The Worlds and other modern big-budget adult popcorn blockbusters where real death is part of the action.

The only thing that disturbed me a bit was the concept of the femme fatal at the college actually being a Decepticon in disguise. I can buy into the concept of large and small mechanical objects suddenly converting into various robots but a living, breathing (hot!) female human being lying on top of you suddenly converting into a deadly machine brought me into Terminator land and I thought that misstep wrecked the philosophy of the film and torpedoed the concept of the two different races of Humans and Robots. Maybe this idea exists in the old comic version of Transformers but if not, it was a structural error on the part of the writers which now opens up some unacceptable storyline possibilities for future installments, if any (you know there will be, of course).

Needless to say I am very disappointed in this BD.",1256083200,,1196,4.632075471698113
3441392,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Bay, I want my goddamn brain cells back!  Every once in a while a movie comes along that reminds me why we have terms like OMFG.  This is one of those movies.  Like Devastator, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is big and looks totally awesome.  But also like Devastator in this film, pretty much all it does is SUCK!  If you could sue an artist for making the world you live in a stupider place, Michael Bay would be so snowed under by lawsuits that he would never be able to work again.  Millions of slack-jawed yokels would cry at the thought, but then they'd see something shiny and forget all about it.  Cinema would be like a utopian wonderland of intelligent creative films that deliver both thrills and wit in equal portions and Hollywood would burn to the ground as actual artists got a chance to succeed and not be plowed under by the juggernaut of hacks with massive budgets who only know how to throw cliches and massive special effects at the audience and hope they're too busy staring at the hot lead actress's jiggling hotness as she runs from explosions in a low-cut top to care that they are essentially being told that they are imbeciles by the same people who are taking their money.  Wouldn't that be nice?

Okay, Bayformers 2: Revenge of the Terrible Writers.  I need some positivity after that rant.  Let's talk about the good.  Bay apparently took the criticisms of the first film to heart.  I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;to be as hugely entertaining as it was moronic and actually enjoyed a lot of the jokes, as juvenile as they were.  It succeeded on a crowd-pleasing scale and I had a very good time watching it.  But the action scenes were a bloody mess.  Just random images of rolling, leaping, and tumbling robots that looked absolutely wonderful but you had no idea what the hell they were doing because the direction was so unbelievably inept.  ""Revenge of the Fallen"" fixes this complaint admirably.  The action scenes are epic and you can actually see what's going on with a lot of wide-angle shots and solid editing.  No complaints with the action itself at all, really.  The overall direction was pretty good as far as the fun stuff goes and it was killer to see Rampage.  Bumblebee and Bestimus Mucho (or is it Optimus Prime?) were also very cool.  There, I said something nice.  Now brace yourself.  The bad news is coming hard and fast.

Holy sonofawhattheHELL were those writers thinking?!  I simply cannot believe that there is a single person on this planet that would read that script and say ""yeah, that's definitely not the stupidest thing ever"".  If there is, then we deserve to be obliterated by a race of evil robots.  ""Mean robots suck!""  That's what they came up with for the Autobots to yell at the Decepticons?  Seriously?  And what do they tell the humans, you ask?  How about ""Why don't you get a haircut with your b!+ch a*#!"".  Seriously.  That's what they came up with.  I want to line up every person from the guy who wrote that line to the director, producers, and everyone else right down to the voice actor who didn't say ""no effing way am I going to say that retarded sh!+"" and kick them each squaw in the nuts.  And while I'm on topic, yes Mudflap and Skids are as bad as advertised.  Worse even.  Any claim that they aren't racist caricatures is pretty much squashed as when one admits in his transvestite Chris Tucker impersonation ""Ummm...we don't read much"" .  Get it?!  Because robots who behave like black people are supposed to are stupid and ignorant!  Like black people!  HAHAHAHA!  That is so funny and clever!  Do I mind racist humor?  No, I seek it out.  But it needs to be A) funny,  B) satirical or ironic, C) aimed at adults who can understand B, and preferably D) all of the above.  And this is without a doubt a kid's movie.  A movie that damn near earns an R-Rating with near-constant profanity, I might add.  Because it's 100% necessary to have a robot based on an 80's childrens cartoon designed to sell toys curse out ""punka*# Decepticons"".  Ooh, edgy. And nothing could be more hilarious then watching dogs have sex.  Multiple times.  And then having a pint-sized robot hump the lead actress's leg in a similar manner.  So funny. Maybe they'll do a live-action ""Clifford: The Big Red Dog"" film and have him rape Emily Elizabeth and call her a whore before rocking a giant canine Cleveland Steamer on her.  That'd be totally boss, dude!  High five!

Alrighty then, so Michael Bay and George Lucas have this bet going about who can utterly destroy our childhood icons more completely.  Sorry, Lucas; it takes a special kind of talent to do something so completely moronic that it insults the intelligence of every single person who sees it.  You at least, used to make great movies.  To be fair, he did totally rip off your moronic droid humor and racial caricaturing, though.  Bay has spent his entire career going out of his way to make film fans suffer.  You're just outclassed.  He's like the Andy Kaufman of filmmaking.  He just wants to see if we're stupid enough to buy into this so he can get his own laughs.  Even Lucas would never let Linkin Park score his film.  Those guys were out of date before their second album even dropped.  I'm putting money on Limp Bizkit for the next film.  Don't laugh.  Can I turn my brain off and enjoy the big dumb boominess of a film like this?  Absolutely.  But if a filmmaker is going to persistently kick me in the face with a slew of one-dimensional characters that each represents a single one-note joke repeated in every scene they are in and have them continue to build on each other until the entire film is a retarded symphony of extremely unfunny cliche then I'm not going to have a good time.  I realize Bay wants us to share and appreciate his love of explosions, but making every frame where nothing is exploding a living hell to sit through can make a 2 1/2 hour film rather tedious.  And I dare ANYBODY who is not an old-school superfan to name more then a few of the dozens of Transformers in this film.  Or more then 5 human characters for that matter.  2 1/2 hours is a long, long time to have zero character development aside from a contest between the two charisma-free leads to see who will say ""I love you"" first.  Guess what?  I didn't care!  I wanted them both to die.  There's not a single human I didn't want to die, really.  Kind of makes you wonder why they'd even bother.

So there you have it.  ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" makes a great case for stupidest movie of the decade. There are stupider film out there, but this is the one that is not only stupid itself, but it proves how stupid we as a culture have become.  That is a monumental cinema achievement.  I gave it a chance since I enjoyed the first film, but my instinct to avoid paying to see it in the theater rang true.  If you could take the fantastic action scenes and hire a real science fiction writer who is a fan of the old show, this could have been something really special. But it's so like Hollywood to spare no expense on the special effects and marketing and just hire some random idiots to bang out some half-baked adolescent garbage for a script.  If we keep going to see this stuff, rest assured that they will keep it coming and continue to ignore anything of any actual quality.  I gave this a shot and it bricked right off of the backboard.  Now I'm taking my ball and I'm going home.  No more Shia ""world's biggest d-bag"" Lebouf, no more robots that make obnoxious animal noises and fart and tinkle all over the place, no more sub-grade school humor, no more WTF's.  I'm calling this whole thing off.",1256083200,11,7776,4.598689002184996
3441393,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Yea, it's all in good fun, so  any critiquing of the movie you sorta have to hedge against something who's origins are based on a kids toy. Michael Bay certainly gets props for creativity and trying to squeeze an entertaining story from thin air, but this movie like ALL of his movies, is like sitting thru a 2 hour movie trailer. The guy just doesn't stop to give gravitas to ANY scene, longer than a few seconds, before the camera is zipping to the next shot. Some people might appreciate that for the rapid fire action that also follows suit, but it get VERY old for me after 30 minutes or so. This one, like the first, have dazzling special effects that are enough to enjoy all by themselves. The story and hyperactive shot editing are bad enough that I didn't even care to see how this turned out, also just like the first one. I quit watching about an hour in, even by then the CGI'd effects become rote. If ever I became a film director , and wanted a guy to put together an adrenalin and action packed trailer, Michael Bay is the guy I'd call. For anything longer than that....pass. I found the most entertaining part of the movie to be LeBouf's parents, that was a hoot. Maybe Bay should try his hand at a comedy next. We've got enough 'shot like a movie trailer' , 'editor on speed' blockbusters to last a lifetime from him.",1256083200,2,1334,4.357429718875502
3441394,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I'll keep this short and sweet.  The visual effects and action are very good.  The story was non-existent, acting could have been better, ending was anticlimactic, I'm pretty sure the screenwriters didn't proof read the script, and they movie lost me when Shia went to Transformers heaven.  I can normally sit through senseless action movies with ease, but I was simply so irritated by the lack of heart that I couldn't enjoy this, really sad considering I really enjoyed the movie. One star for the cool action sequence in the woods.",1256083200,26,534,4.846153846153846
3441395,4,B0019M5C0Q,"In terms of the DVD itself, the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Two Disc Special Edition DVD features, on the first disc the actual movie itself.  Transformers: ROTF was a moviTe that needed to be seen more than twice because of the fact that the CGI scenes were just so intense and large that one could not possibly everything there is to see during some of these shots, especially the transformation sequences. No matter what your opinion is of the plot of the film itself and what not, this was an impressive CGI film feat. That is really all there is on the first disc (well commentary by Micheal Bay, hes a hilarious guy)

The second disc features a nearly 2 hour general feature on many of the processes of making the movie. Rather than splitting it into the usual segments, theyve just combined it into one huge 2 hour fest of things dealing with filming at each location, the actors, sound design, etc.  There is also a feature on the premiere in Japan, a feature on 25 years of Transformers, and a music video.  The 2 hours long one is in my opinion one of the best features Ive seen and with it so long, I wonder if there is even more stuff they left out for the DVD release. I could imagine they have extra stuff just lying around for a trilogy pack special edition in the future.

For the price that Amazon offers this film, I would say it is definitely worth a rent, and a purchase if Transformers is your thing. Its a pretty solid offering, and for CGI buffs, this movie is awesome.  Moviewise, by now youve either seen it or not, so you know if you liked the plot or not, rent it if you haven't seen it in theaters.",1256083200,,1633,4.3202614379084965
3441396,1,B0019M5C0Q,"It has been a long time since I have felt the urge to write a  review. This movie is terrible, just terrible. Here are few reasons why I think so:

1.  Script is horrible. They just decided to make a second movie for the sake of making more money and did not really care about the point or a story of which there is none.

2.  If you have not seen the first movie, don't even bother because it is not made for you.

3.  Fight sequence is also confusing given that you really can't tell who is destroying who.

4.  Knowing that you can not just have 2.5 hours of explosions, between fight sequences we have the most ridiculous dialog I have ever heard in a movie, therefore you have 15 minute time blocks which should used for more important tasks such as pulling your hair out one at a time.

5.  Acting (or better over-acting) is some of the worst you will ever see. Given that there was NOTHING of value to say, director asked everyone to just speak louder and look more stressed for no reason.

6.  Clearly attempt was made to make this funny. THEY FAILED. This movie is NOT FUNNY. Inappropriate and vulgar 1 liners should not be sold as humor. They are actually offensive.

There are so many more I can list, but writing this means I have to think about the movie which is making me angry again. Who can I file a lawsuit against to get 2.5 hours of my life back? I don't know which part was more sad: the fact that money was spent making this garbage, or the fact that so many people actually thought that this was a good action movie.

This movie should win EVERY raspberry award.",1256083200,11,1585,4.236666666666666
3441397,5,B0019M5C0Q,"I've concluded that Revenge of the Fallen failed with the critics and a handful of internet geeks due to a lack of first-hand knowledge with the material.  The movie was never intended to be a masterful work of cinematic art but rather a fun, metal on metal adventure - it's Transformers, not Sophie's Choice.  I'm not in the theater for a touching human drama, or up-scale humor [however the Twins are a little too overblown and annoying I must admit]. I'm there for a realistic version of Saturday morning adventure - and Revenge of the Fallen delievers.

The 'supposed' plot holes are actually just threads where a lack of elaboration on the writer's part, of which they've even admitted on the commentary, failed to explain themselves to the general audience. When the Writers Strike hit, the plot of the movie was jumbled together from an initial outline, and then of course, the oh-so-famous curse of too many hands in the cookie jar.  Directorial compromises, Producer requests, etc. So I can see where people had a tiff or two, but for those of us who read the Marvel Comics run know about the abstract use of the Matrix of Leadership. (We also aren't tweens or ignorant critics who don't realize the Matrix of Leadership pre-dated Keanu Reeves by 13 years.) Those of us who read Dreamwave's War Within: The Dark Ages were familiar with The Fallen.  And most importantly - any fan who, like me, still watches the Gen 1 cartoon and digs multi-part episodes like 'Five Faces of Darkness' know that a good Transformer tale is nothing more than a race between good and evil to get their hands on the object in question.

For a Transfan, the movie has a treasure trove of nods to the mythology - Soundwave & Ravage, the use of Combiner/Gestalt technology, Pretender technology, Power-Up technology, the crashed Nemesis, the Matrix of Leadership, and Megatron finally gets his arm canon - sort of.

For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, ignore the criticism and instead use your own judgement.  If you like the Transformer brand and look for new stories, check out this flick.  If you just want to watch something you think you'll like, or expect to hate for that matter, don't bother. If you are curious, though, and want to bone up your mythology beforehand, read The Transformers issues #1-12 from 1980s, War Within: The Dark Ages, and watch the classic 1986 animated movie.  Then you'll be prepared for Revenge of the Fallen.",1256083200,7,2431,4.766666666666667

Okay, enough venting... the movie in Blu-ray format was simply stunning... details and resolution was a big WOW... sound effects was awesome in DTS.  I bought the movie simply for the constant non-stop action, awesome graphics and surround sound, blu-ray quality... I would even go as far to say the story although somewhat simple, is not bad... not perfect, not great, but not bad as well...

3441402,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The odious and equally talentless Megan Fox's stellar contribution to this film can be summed up to this: slow motion running in a tank top sporting a push-up bra. The rest of this dim-wit's on screen presence is as forgettable as her lines. Representative of Hollywood's new batch of moronic young things, Ms. Fox is sure not to disappoint once the Transformers trilogy ends . I'm sure her off screen escapades will be the stuff of tabloid legend once faced with the reality of fading stardom.

But let us not linger on the worm in the apple.

The movie would've done better by cutting 30-40 minutes off the top. The set up to Shia LaBeouf's leaving to college and scenes thereof did nothing to move the plot. His mother's escapades border more on the obnoxious than funny. By contrast, the last half or so shines beyond expectation with brilliant special effects and dessert battle scenes. Also consistently carried from the first Transformers is the wry humor- but we sorely miss Bernie Mac! John Turturro's reappearance was also a wonderful surprise.
The writers and director would be wise to take geography lessons- the locations made no sense to those paying attention, but that's small stuff.

So while you can't CGI talent (read, Megan Fox), you can CGI a fantastic effects driven adventure to hopefully eclipse the incidental talentless bimbo.",1255996800,8,1352,4.921052631578948
3441403,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I am surprised at how many people really love this movie and feel its a great movie. Some claiming the greatest action film, while others astounded at the special effects, some saying its incredibly emotional and impacting. For me, I felt continually hammered over the head until my senses were numb to everything going on in the film.

The story, however dense or plotless you may feel it is, was mishandled and confusing. The action sequences were lengthy and generally a mish-mash of shiny metal parts. I could not tell who was fighting and for the most part, did not care. I know teenagers will love this movie and could tolerate the high-intensity-over-stimulation scenes can bring and be able to know what is going on, but from someone who is older, I found them overwhelming to the point where the action was undecipherable.

The robots were more biological this time around which took away from the 'Transformers' understanding that they were cars, or at least machines, and could transform into some known image, like a humanoid or beast like machine. But when I saw the ""Other Hot Chick"" in the movie, and she was a robot, it became a new breed of transforming and so to me it was out of the realm of what I knew Transformers to be.

The film is directed by Michael Bay who seems to put so much into one scene and have these grand panoramic sweeping shots that it engulfs the plot and through-action, that I gave up trying to sort out any meaning to the film. It looks like a cyclone of machine parts moving across the screen.

The star, Shiah Labeouf, reprises his neurotic annoying character who has no other meaningful lines besides ""No-no-no-no-no...."" Megan Fox looks like she is in a Playboy shoot in every scene. John Turturro is the best part of the film.

If I could comment on the special effects, while they are incredible, what is more incredible is that the special effects artists were able to tell themselves what characters were transforming into what, and also who was fighting who.

Lastly, there were so many scenes that did not need to exist, such as the mom who ate some pot brownies and got high at Sam's school. Its not comic relief, it does nothing for the plot. The film is already 2 and half hours, why do we need this scene? Megan Fox could have been cut entirely and it would not have changed one scene in the film. Sam going to college was not necessary either. Dwight Schrute, err, I mean, Rainn Wilson, had a small and unimportant role.

In the beginning of the film it was cutely set up to hear Sam have difficulty saying 'I love you' to the hottest chick in the room (Megan Fox). Later in the film, Sam is knocked out for the count and goes to Transformers heaven for a brief moment, and in that time Megan says (with all of her best emotional effort) 'I love you'. That seemed to save Sam and he came back to life at that moment. True love does indeed conquer all.

In sum, I thought this was a terrible film, virtually in every respect. It had occurred to me, while watching this film, that lots of action and great special effects do not equal and exciting film. In fact, my senses were so dulled from over stimulation that I found them boring. Michael Bay had stated he was not going to do Transformers 3 and vowed not to do high budget films in favor of and independent film to prove his directorial prowess. However, temptation of the big bucks could not sway his passion for directing when he agreed to do a third part. I cant imagine what a mess that will be. I admit, I rented this movie on the pretense that it was going to be a bad film. And it was. I just needed to see how bad it was.",1255996800,12,3640,4.422388059701492

Too bad that it was marketed too heavily towards younger kids - it's just not appropriate.  Sexually suggestive scenes, way too much profanity, crude and lewd 8th grade bathroom humor.  Bay could have cut out every single ""bxxch, shxx"", mom eating pot brownies at college (in fact maybe they should kill the parents off altogether), the homeboy robot humor (which I didn't find funny), the sexually suggestive robot scene could have been redone,  and made this MUCH more enjoyable even for adults.

Story 5/5

It's a typical end of the world type of scenario. A new (but old) decepticon known as the fallen is trying to resurrect an ancient machine that destroys suns!! But even as average as the plot seems it fits well will transformers since back in the day every episode of transformers was about some sort of destruction or end of world scenario. Optimus is back along with bumblebee and new comers known as the twins!! More decepticons also join the fight but are never really introduced!! Starscream returns to bring back his fallen master Megatron who longs to have his master (the fallen) return to earth to destroy mankind!

Presentation 5/5

Definitely one of the best looking blu rays to date! I enjoyed watching this movie not once but twice to view every detail that was put into the fight scenes when pieces of metal would fly everywhere!! The explosions this time around are bigger much bigger and happen more frequently than the first! They definitely wanted to go out with a bang on this sequel and executed it well!

Extras 5/5

With over 3+ hours of extras I have yet to even scratch the surface on all the information they give you on the special features disc! The commentaries, overviews, how they did its and more are all jam packed in this disc and it's brilliant!! My only grip so far is the lack of PiP which is one of my favorite features to have on a blu-ray movie but since there is so much extra content I've let it go

Overall 4/5

Definitely one of the best Blu-rays to get this year and even if you haven't seen this film in theaters definitely worth the buy on Blu-ray disc!! Thanks for watching my vid and reading my review more to come once I receive more Blu-rays!! Have a great day!!",1255996800,19,2287,5.298342541436464

The movie looks and sounds incredible in its Bluray edition, the level of detail (1080p) on the scenery, the characters, the robots (while transforming for example) and the sounds during the battles make perfect reference material for HD home theater display, a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio track is included, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital are also presented. There is however, an exclusive edition which includes the IMAX scenes in shifting aspect ratio, this is not the version Amazon is selling in case that's the version you are after.

Disc two is loaded with plenty of extra material in full HD:
* The Human Factor (Exacting Revenge of the Fallen) - Includes documentaries covering the whole process from Development and design to post-production and release of the film, you can watch them separately or as a whole.
* A Day with Bay: Tokyo - If you followed the release of the film in theaters you may remember the world premiere took place in Tokyo; this documentary includes all the details on the premiere, from Bay's impressions on 'Terminator Salvation', to the press conferences and the like. While in HD most of the time there are some night shots that do not look that well.
* 25 Years of Transformers - This is a documentary on the history of the Transformers franchise.
* Deleted/Alternate Scenes - Only three are included and they are actually extended scenes that you can easily tell why they were removed (""Sam and Alice meet"", ""Witwickys in Paris""  and ""Leo refuses to go to Egypt"")
* Linkin Park's ""New Divide"" Music Video
*The Matrix of Marketing - Includes trailers, TV spots and image galleries of posters and merchandise.

While I prefer the first movie over this one, 'Revenge of the fallen"" does not disappoint in its Bluray edition. Another Michael Bay popcorn film filled with explosions, great cars and giant transforming robots. If you, like me, get this movie just for the fun and do not expect Criterion Collection material, you are in for a treat.

One last note for those collectors interested in slipcovers, Amazon's edition comes in a pretty cool Optimus Prime one.",1255824000,7,2581,4.778026905829597

3441412,5,B0019M5C0Q,Micheal Bay did it again! This movie is just as great as the first. The awesome fight scenes and intense action definitly make up for the lacking storyline.

You don't need someone telling you that a movie sucked and you miss out because you take that person's word for it.  Sure it's not perfect, but then again what movie is?  This is an action flick.  It won't win any Oscars for best picture or best actor/actress.  It was made for pure entertainment and that is it.  It made a crapload of money at the box office and will do so again in DVD/Blu-ray sales.  All I can say is bring on Transformers III!",1255478400,8,697,4.3671875

The movie on the whole is OK but the picture & particularly the sound is too good. My whole room was shaking thru out the movie. Once the IMAX version comes out I will definetly buy that. I don't understand the logic behind giving just one store the monopoly to sell the IMAX version whilst rest of the world watches the normal version.

3441415,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Where should I begin?
The story never seemed to quite fit in the transformers universe. First, Who is this fallen guy and why should we care about him? Megatron was supposed to be the worst SOB robot out there, (at least thats what we were told over and over in the first movie) turns out he is just a little sissy that works for this fallen robot which we have never heard of before, and doesn't look threatening at all. Another thing that makes no sense to me, Whats the point of fighting and trying to kill robots if its so easy to revive them? It was clearly stated at the end of Transformers that Megatron was death and dropped to sink at the world's deepest sea, making it impossible for him to come back thus the cold temperature wouldn't allow transformers to go get him because cold causes malfunctions to them, This rule was crucial in the plot of the first movie. Now it only takes about 4 generic robots to break this rule, dive in, fix Megatron, and he is back only to disappoint. Optimus gets very little screen time because of a fatal fight, but again it's so easy to bring him back to life!, even though he is the hero of this saga he made very little impact on this movie.
Another thing that drove me crazy, Whats the point of having robots transforming into cars when there are robots that can be human like? completely unnecessary.

So you have all of this great characters settled down from the First movie,Ironhide, Ratchet, Starscream ... they are all important Transformers and people are familiar with them, but instead you get Skids and Mudflaps, two annoying negro twins, wheels, a leg humping gremlin robot, and jetfire, an ancient robot that teleports(?). So bumble bee was supposed to be the comic relief of this movie, having all of this robots that have the archetype of a pixar character at the same time, just annoyed me to my nerves and skull.
And this also makes me think: Who is this movie marketed for? Little kids? Teenagers who love Megan Fox and other unnecessary sexy scenes? Transformer fans? Action fans? Its hard to tell because at times the movie is edgy and violent and at times its cartoonish.
Some human characters were also as annoying as the ""Pixar"" robots: Sam's parents and that Mexican dude. Really, why were they there the whole time? Every dialogue leads to a punch line, at the end its way overdone and unnecessary.
The story delivers the most outdone cliches in holywood, its hard to list them all. Believe me.

I have to give credit to the artists on charge of the special effects, congratulations. This is the only reason why I give a star to this movie and the only reason why this movie did so good on the box office. All of you have to admit that. But having great special effects just doesn't cut it.
Not after watching other contemporary sci-fi movies such as: Batman, Hancock, Iron man, Star trek, Terminator and District 9 among others. Such movie franchises with such large followings are obligated to reach nothing else but prime quality film making. What I'm trying to say is that you need a good story to back up the great elements of fantasy and special effects.

This isn't worth owning, but it could be a great rental if you don't mind the silly (stupid) details.

On a final thought, I ought a quote from The Lou's review:  ""This review isn't for most younger viewers. Teenagers will mostly like this flick. Also adults who have the emotional depth of a teenager""",1255392000,17,3437,4.555016181229774
3441416,4,B0019M5C0Q,"I will try to give me reviews without the following:

SPOILERS, and

COMPARING THIS MOVIE TO A WHOLE GENERATION OF TRANSFORMERS SERIES THAT HAVE BEEN ITS PREDECESSORS.

Come on people...I have read the previous reviews, and some of you have tried to compare this one movie to the entire series of previous transformers that have been out since the earlier generations. That is NOT going to happen. Michael Bay had to fit what he could into two movies, and he did a good job. Yes it has humour, yes it has cussing here and there, that's why it's not rated G. You knew that before you took your kids to see it. And in regards to the Token Black thing, I disagree. Like Jazz, in transformers I (I love Jazz, he is a cool hip Transformer, and Darius McCrary, a BLACK actor, did his voice people...the perfect actor, for his part), Autobots Skidz and Mudflap may be mouthy, but they were not ignorant. Did you see anywhere where any other Autobots or Decepticons picked up a dictionary and quoted out of a Thesaurus either? Good grief.

And about Sam reacting to touching the Shard, versus carrying the Cube in the first movie...think about it. At the end of the First movie, he put the entire cute in Megatron's chest, which caused a reaction to the cube itself. You all forgot that ending when you wrote your reviews for ROTF. Could that be the reason why the Shard reacted when he touched it in the second movie? Hmmm......

And Good grief, don't talk about Megan being naked. She had clothes on. Don't talk about the mother, she was there for humour. And I liked Jetfire, he was cool.

If you don't like Michael Bay's movies, why do you continue to watch them. Don't go see them then. Problem Solved. As for me, this movie was kick-butt. Loved the Tranformers before these movies, loved them after these movies. Graphics are good, voices are great, Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, and yes, even little Wheelie (who for some reason I find cute as little Autobot) are great. Even Skidz and Mudflap will continue to grow I believe. If there is a Transformers III i'll be in line to see it.",1255305600,4,2092,4.550531914893617
3441417,5,B0019M5C0Q,"Don't be fooled by the ""nay-sayers"", it's everything the first was and more. Way more action. way more humor. I don't get the bad reviews, if you were a fan of the first.  It's not meant to be a thriller, a suspence, or romance movie, just action and this movie delivers in spades.  If u liked the first, then u should love this one. Twice the fun. Michael Bay did a great job on this one can't wait to see the next.",1255305600,,416,4.060975609756097
3441418,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Let me begin by saying that I am and always will be a diehard Transformers Fan. I thought the 1st movie and most of the cartoon series were wonderful and could not wait until this movie was released. Words cannot describe how painfully disappointed I was in this film. To me there was no worthy plot. This should have been called ""The Witwicky Chronicles featuring the Transformers"". There is too much emphasis on the human characters in this movie. Do we really need to know that Sam is going to college? Do we need to see his mom crying and acting stupid for a straight 30 minutes? Did we need to introduce new human characters and give them a bigger part of the movie than the robots that the film is named after? Also Shia is one of the most annoying actors out there today, which made it even harder for me to watch.  This is not at all what I expected from a TF movie. When I think of a TF movie I think of TRANSFORMERS, and nothing else. I could care less for the human side of the story. In the future I would suggest less human interaction. More story behind the Robots. (btw did the new TF's even have names?) More screen time with the robots and did I mention, less humans? Kind of like the cartoons, you know? I also found a lot of the movie inappropriate. I love crude humor and inappropriateness, but this is not the format for such things. I could have done without the dog humping, testicle jokes.  This type of thing has no relevance to the Transformers, so keep it out of the movie. Overall , less humans, get rid of Shia, stay out of the desert, and give the bots the majority of the screen time. I haven't given up yet though. Hopefully the makers will notice their mistakes and make the next film better.

Another thing I'd like to add, since when does Megatron answer to anyone? This movie takes what makes Megatron, Megatron and makes a mockery of the character.",1255305600,18,1885,4.349431818181818
3441419,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Questions that the creators of this movie just jumped around.

Remember the 1st gen 80's cartoons. Thanks for ruining that memory. Even my 9 year old likes them better than these 2 illogical movies.

If the cube slice can re-animate megatron in the ocean, why not optimus? Why go find some long hidden 'bot' at the smithsonian? And why would he be there. What did he do for the many thousand years of human history. Look like a big bird?

The ""Fallen?"" Where was he in the first flick when Megatron was frozen for thousands of years.

Why didn't Optimus know about him. he was a ""Descendant' of the 'primes'?

Why would the other Primes kill themselves to keep one prime from turning evil leaving no chance to defend the universe from 1. You mean 6 against 1 is no match? But their less powerful descendant Optimus is more than a match and defeats him in a matter of less than a minute in movie time? Yet, Megatron escapes again?

Why does prime discard his new found powers at the end of the show. Anyone in the position to serve and protect is going to keep this power in order to be optimally primed for megatron's next assault. But not our hero! Really?

Why only one 'bot' that can transform into a human? Surely, they all could turn into human form since they are the most advanced robots in the universe?

Why did they make the Decepticon's so hard to see any differences. Very annoying. In the cartoon...each robot was very easy to tell apart from another.

Slow the *beep* down. Jeez Mike, get on some medication dude. Even our nation of hyperactive drug induced kids can't handle this crap. Let us see the transforming robots, let us see something other than blurring, who is holding the camera? hard to see CGI sequences. While this one is better for the camera sequences than the 1st, it still got very aggravating. After watching something like District 9 with it's incredible CG, I have to say this movie failed. It was just not even close to as realistic looking and at least District 9 left you feeling like you actually interacted with the characters. Even the CG ones.

After all this I still found some way to sit through this movie and if you can overlook all these glaring flaws, it was fun. But not worthy of great. Michael Bay just doesn't make movie that are going to last more than a pop fad----which stinks because Transformer's was a great franchise until they allowed him to trash it. After this movie I felt somewhat the same when I went to see the original cartoon movie and Optimus Prime was killed off and Rodimus Prime took over the autobots. ""It must be a mistake"" ""maybe the next movie the bring him back."" It was funny because alot of us fans of the cartoon completely lost interest after that and they finally did bring him back....but it was too late by then. Same thing here.",1255046400,11,2814,4.489236790606654
3441420,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Explosions? Bad acting? Sexy ladies to distract you from the terrible plot? Robot Heaven (shame on Michael Bay for not putting deceased Jazz in that scene)? Leg Humpings? Racist stereotypes? Men in thongs? Bumblebee not being able to talk with narry an explanation? Unanswered questions?

Many questions are raised by Michael Bay's first (or umpteenth) avant garde art film, but the most important one is: Should you watch it?

If you're a kid, maybe, but your parents should get ready to ask what a ""[...]"" is when one of the previously mentioned robot calls one of the supporting actors one for being a coward. There's so many new robots (both good and bad) in this one that the ones fans of the first film are familiar with are hardly seen at all (outside of kid faves 'bee and Prime, of course) in the entire movie.

Casual moviegoers may find this one great, but it's nowhere near as awesome as Star Trek (or Wolverine for that matter, and that movie gave Deadpool eyebeams and SWORD claws, for Chrissakes).

It's already been announced 3 is on the way, and Lord Above, they are wanting to do Unicron (A PLANET THAT CHANGES INTO A ROBOT) for some ultimately stupid reason. Amazingly, this film is nearly the same length as the somewhat easier to watch film, but betweent he explosions and shifting hours... I had little idea what was going on.

The death of Optimus Prime, in a forest, is probably the best part about this movie, because when it ends, every stupid robot is still alive.",1255046400,8,1491,4.653992395437262
3441421,5,B0019M5C0Q,"The plot was more in depth than what people realize.  It makes subliminal references to the greatest story ever told.  The cube is a reference to the hand of god, the cube can take and give life. It shows in the first and second films how it can give to or take from those that are evil.  The cube shard in the second one, represents the apple.  It is the forbidden fruit and is the temptation of all the knowledge of an entire species is too overwhelming, even to a human.  Even someone like Sam.  Its failure of rationalization when simple-minded critics realize a concept that is as easy as this.

Optimus Prime is a science fiction reference to Jesus.  He faces adversity from everyone that he has trusted.  He died for Sam's poor decision not to assist him to guiding humanity to the right path.  But his followers and Sam realize the errors in their way and played a key role in the resurrection of the greatest developed science fiction character of all time.  Sam is your lost person, he does not have any fixed path to follow but with the assistance of the Auto Bots he was able to see past the errors in his way and stay with the girl he loves and be able to set focused goals.

The film has other great messages embedded in the deep and interwoven plot.  For example, respect to the elderly.  When it comes to Jet Fire, he shows how our culture has lost respect for assistance from the elderly.  How no matter how old and brittle someone is they can still be the most valuable person to help you overcome any obstacle.

The ""crude"" humor and swearing is only a reference to how low we set ourselves for a good laugh.  You have to place items such as this into an epic masterpiece like this in order to get the deep messages out to a broader audience and keep simple minds entertained.

This movie is a phenomenal blockbuster and the special features are cool.  It is in the top 10 of the greatest movies ever made.  If anyone says different do not believe them.  When everything is said and done, it is a movie based on toys.  So it is great for that.",1254960000,8,2062,4.315104166666667
3441422,5,B0019M5C0Q,"I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious!!! Ok sure they botched a couple things like the true power of the matrix of leadership. In the cartoon it had the power to cure the entire universe of the hate plague yet in the movie can't even heal optimus all the way. Also how rampage is in two places at once? He is fighting bumblebee and yet is supposed to be the left leg of devastator (who is tearing down a pyramid at the same time as rampage is fighting bumblebee)um...yea....how does that work? The movie also explains prime's ancestors, the 7 primes. No place in any episode of any saga explains who came before optimus prime. That and it shows who came before megatron, although the true megatron bowed down to no-one with the exception of unicron, but whole other movie.
My friend told me that the first movie barely dodged a rated r rating, which after seeing this movie I believe this one barely dodged the r rating not the first.
The only shocker I got was the fact that people were bringing their little kids to this movie. Ok if you've seen the first...that one had a couple questionable moments for kids to be watching, do you honestly think the second one was going to be any better? This is the more adult version of transformers. Made for the original generation that watched it and the youngest('84), that possibly remembers the original series on t.v.(like me.)

What makes even worse is because the first movie is one of my all-time favorites. I really wanted to like this movie but by the end I just couldn't. Here are some problems/questions I had with the movie:

1. Why was the hero able to run around carrying the cube in the first movie, but when he briefly touches a shard of it in the second his mind is ""Imprinted"" with these symbols?

2. Why did the deceptagons kinap his parents just to (without any explanation) let them go when they got to Egypt?

3. Couldn't the heros in the movie think of a better distraction for the guards in the Smithsonian than to have a guy drop his pants and run around talking about how he had just taken a dump and they were out of toilet paper? What an idiotic idea!

4. Why was it neccessary for the plot to get the kids mom stoned. Besides who could be that stupid? The bag had a picture of a pot leaf on it!

5. The kid has a shard that brought a bunch of kitchen appliances to life and when Optimus gets killed it doesn't dawn on him to try to use it to revive him? Why did he give it to his girlfriend anyway to hold on to? It's obviously dangerous and he give it to her with no explanation as to why and no warning?

6. Autobots hidden from the public? Oh so a giant battle in the middle of a city (from the first movie) didn't get anyones attention?

7. Was it really neccessary to have a Autobot with testicles and have another hump a girls leg? That's just trash!

The movie was emabarassing and I cannot believe the script made it to the screen. It seems like the movie was another attempt by Hollywood to dish out a bunch of trash to appeal the lowest denominator of our society. I think all the 5-star ratings really shows how morally bankrupt people have become. Finally, I am not that critical about plot holes but in this movie they were so bad as to be rediculous.

A buy if you want to collect transformer films, and you will most likely want to watch it more than once, so I wouldn't rent it.  BUY IT.

With that said, now I can let this out.  The first installment is in my top 10 cartoon/comic book to movie films.  This one, however, came up a bit short.
First off, way too much cursing. I don't have any kids, and I know there are movies that have much more in them, but cmon, it was unnecessary.  Someone with a very limited vocabulary would find profanity humorous.  I don't...

It was too long. I would've ended the first movie when they dropped Optimus Prime back at the base for NEST, and the following movie I would've built on that, and had them find the Matrix of Leadership, and that would've made room for my next two BIG issues...

""Jazz"", my favorite Autobot from the cartoon series, was ripped in half, and died without a chance in the previous movie.  Despite that, as big as ""Devastator"" was in this film, what kinda damage did he really do?  All that, for what? Cmon... More screen time is all I'm saying.

And the same goes for ""Fallen."" He wasn't ""the man"" after all.  He was moving boulders around like Darth Vader, he deserved some more screen time... lots more.  With that I mean screen time with him pimp slapping some of the Autobots around a bit.

And that roommate of Sam's, completely useless character.

The twins were kinda funny, and I didn't see anything racially motivated with their humor, although it was unnecessarily vulgar. I'm sorry, but I just kept thinking Spongebob Squarepants... Can you blame me?

By the way, Arcee was whack. Why'd they do that?

3441434,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Here is my list as to why ""Revenge of the Fallen"" did not appeal to me:

1)  You still have trouble telling the Transformers apart when they are fighting, especially the Decepticons.  That was the main complaint from people who watched the film the first time and Dreamworks did nothing, in this movie, to fix the problem.  You can never tell which Transformer got destroyed.  You can only guess.

2)  There is not a single strong female character in the film.  The mother acts like a retard throughout the film.  Her role was to play a ditz.  Then you had the girl Transformer who is trying to get with Shia's character and you also have Meghan Fox's character.  I understand that both were there to appeal to a teenage audience, but at least try to give one woman some depth.  Fox's entire role was to show some cleavage and run in slow motion so people could see her breasts bounce.  Boing Boing Boing.  Also, there is not a single strong female character in the military.  In fact, I don't think the military, in the film,  has a single female in it at all.  It's a pure sausagefest.  What an insult to the women who serve in our military.

3)  Of course, they didn't just insult women, they insulted African Americans too.  What's the point of having Transformers with gold teeth talking like a bunch of rappers? If the characters talked regularly, no one would have cared.  Why cause controversy over something stupid?  There are not enough Black people behind the scenes in Hollywood and, in instances such as this, it shows. I wonder what race they are going to insult in the third one.  They will probably have a Decepticon blowing up a building, while he wears a turban on his head.  I wouldn't be surprised.

4)  Sometimes, when the Transformers speak, you have to listen carefully.  If you don't, you won't catch what they're saying.  In the final fight scene, this happens quite a bit.  It is amazing that, in the cartoon that is almost 30 years old, one could understand Soundwave and the other Transformers clearly, but, in this film you can't even understand a Transformer trying to talk normally.

5)  Ultimately, it's a boring film.  For me, even if a script is bad, I can still enjoy a movie if it is entertaining.  This film, by halftime, was putting me to sleep.  For an action film, that's bad, especially when the sound of things blowing up isn't waking you up.

So, my point is, why buy the DVD for a movie that you're only going to watch once?",1254096000,4,2468,4.517006802721088

3441436,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Upon its release, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, had been almost unanimously panned by professional critics and word had gotten out to expect a downgrade from its stupid-enough&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/predecessor/dp/B000NTPDT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">predecessor</a>, a movie at least watchable for its spectacular special effects and expertly staged action sequences. Regardless, initial attendance at the theatre was on the level of the record-breaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, which was a prime example of how intelligent, enthralling, and masterful blockbuster entertainment can be. So the question is raised: does anybody hold the movies they see to any standard any more? Will audiences see anything expensive and mass-marketed by Hollywood regardless of its quality?

If the answer is yes, than perhaps this review doesn't really matter. But as someone that had fun with what was to be had in the original Transformers, I found the sequel to not only be boring and obnoxious but insulting.

Shia Labeouf and lather-inducing Megan Fox return as the couple who together discovered the alien robot race in the last one, this time distanced by the former's leaving suburbia for college. The good Transformers, the Autobots, are coalescing with the U.S. Military to fight the remainder of the the bad Transformers, the Decepticons, when word is recieved that an ancient robot called the Fallen is intending to come to Earth to exact destruction on the human race and those who protect them. The story develops into something like that of the first, as there is a race to gain possession of fragments of the powerful All-Spark and another alien technology that can resurrect Transformers.

The plots in these movies are merely frameworks for ""wow"" and ""never-seen-that-before"" moments, and to the total detriment of the movie, Revenge of the Fallen has none of these. When it comes to jaw-dropping sequences, there is nothing like the all-out battle in the city from the previous film: only unsatisfying spurts of action peppered amongst exposition leading up to an anticlimactic finish. The animation of the Transformers has, if anything, improved in the maticulous detail of all the mechanical moving parts, but its impossible to appreciate any effects during indiscernable fights with sophmoric camera work and inattention to geography. Instead of giving us what a fighting robot movie should really be all about (the fighting), Director Michael Bay has stuck to an overlong and loquacious script evidently affected by the writor's strike of 2008. He's also taken what was probably the biggest complaint about his last outing, the crude, juvinile humor, and expanded it to include dry-humping dogs, jive-talking racially-skewed robots, giant testicular robots, and yes, dry-humping robots.

What bothers me so much about all this is that the people involved in making this clunker expected the audience to lap it all up. This is what they think popcorn entertainment should be about. If you ask me, its more like uncooked kernels that have dropped to the concession stand floor.",1253836800,7,3270,5.736082474226804

He tries to keeps connected with his girlfriend, Mikaela who's back at home, via webcam. Sam keeps trying to be normal, but that's just not possible when the Decepticons are after him. That's when everything starts rolling, and, you guessed it, the Autobots need Sam's help again to save the world AGAIN. The action was non-stop (some might think there was too much action), and the graphics and explosions were fantastic just like the first movie. Shia LaBeouf was just as hot as ever, and Megan Fox steamed up the screen as well. I like the tie in to Egyptian culture.

But, maybe, this might be the major problem with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, you don't really need to be a Transformers fan to enjoy this movie.

Why should I say this to be a problem? Let me explain...

This is supposed to be a Giant robot epic. With truly amazing and interesting giant robots fighting each other. The only cool giant robot battle sequence you are thrown at happens on the very first 10 minutes. Showing us only one really cool Transformer, Optimus Prime.
 This movie completely waste the oportunity to showcase new cool characters. It only gives us a pair of stupid twin robots, which could have been easily replaced with any of the Wayans Brothers and might have saved Michael Bay a couple of millions of dollars on special effects....

 This is maybe, even a reason why this movie didn't even need to be based on the popular franchise. You'll find same kind of humor and gags in movies like Scary Movie, Epic Movie, or such. Point in case, For some, one of the funniest moments is when you have a quick peek at Devastator's balls ????!?!?.

So, one star for showing us Megan Fox.
Another star for all the funny moments,
and at least one more star for keeping Optimus Prime honorable and not to force us to see his balls, literally.

First I'd like to mention that the only good thing about this movie was the special effects because everything else was a giant joke.

Obviously this movie could use more fart jokes, less plot, more Meghan Fox running in slow motion, and more token characters that we've seen so many times before. Michael Bay took a beloved if not exactly deep franchise and turned it into a money making monster.

The one that offers no substance but has everything required to make hundreds of thousands of people watch this movie. Your better off seeing District 9 about five times before seeing this steaming pile of garbage.",1253059200,7,701,4.637096774193548

The screenplay/dialogue is just plain ridiculus, and it doesn't have to be that way.  Look at Star Wars (yes all 6).  Granted Lucas did a fine job writing and directing the 1st one (1977), then he was smart enought to pass both the writing and directing over to other people (Lawrence Kasdan, Irving Kershner, Richard Marquand?) for both Empire and Jedi.  Which is why I believe Empire to be the difinitive best of the series.  Then Lucas makes us wait 15 plus years and decides to take full writing and directing credit for the prequels and aside from a few cool scenes, the films were awful.  He should have stayed to story credit and had others write the screenplay and direct.  Point of this is that Michael Bay should have done the same thing, stick to his strengths and produce and leave story and direction to credible people.",1252972800,8,1015,4.483695652173913

And Megan Fox was in it. She's hot. I'm not sure what she did other than run around and work in a motorcycle garage wearing a bathing suit. She's hot.

The Transformers were awesome. One of them had balls! Another one humped Megans leg! Michael Bay, you so craaaaaazy! LOL. I'm mad that none of the robots farted though, or said ""Don't go there"" and then tooted out of his butt with his heiney. That would have been HIlarious. And why wasn't there any Transformers taking a dump? Don't hold back, Michael, I know you wanted to do it. And, like, maybe a Transformer could have gone to class with Sam, and when Sam asked him why he was there the robot would say, ""You gotta have a good education to make it in this world son,"" and then Sam looks at the camera does the shagrinned shoulder shrug. Me like good lesson for kids. They future. Did I mention one of the robots had balls? Balls are hilarious!

There were explosions too. I had no idea what was going on b/c the camera was shaking but the explosions were all like, KAPOW, KABLOOEY, KERPOW. Man, I was so pumped I accidently punched the guy next to me in the face like, dozens of times. Then I kicked the lady who was sitting in front of me in the head, and when she turned around I accidently kicked her in the mouth. I think she might have been a Decepticon.

Then Sam goes to college. He smart. Princeton me think. His mom gets high. No cheap laughs from Bay, no sir.

I guess my only complaint besides it being too short is there weren't any dinosaurs in the movie. It would have gone well with this movie, they'd be all like, Raaaar, and the Transformers would be like, ""Say whaaaaat?""",1252800000,20,1853,4.27065527065527

Rather than try to achieve plot, characterization, and drama (such as was found in Ironman, and Dark Knight), Michael Bay goes for the simpler approach.  Like Indiana Jones and the Starwars before it, Transformers 2 throws out all the building blocks of a good film and replaces it with horrible (and offensive) dialog, ethnic stereotypes, and mindblowing action.

What's bad? Quick list: Transformer's ""testicles"", farting decepticons, dogs fornicating, ghetto-talking transformers with gold teeth & dreadlocks, multiple unneeded upskirt camera angles, John Tuturro in a thong, HORRIBLE ending, too much human army time, storyline itself has innumerable plotholes, etc.

What's good? Megatron/Starscream interactions, the few robot-robot fight scenes, Prime ripping off heads.

Overall this film is mediocre at best. NOT for the under 13 crowd, since this one has triple the offensive innuendo language as the first movie.

My main problem was the lack of a storyline. Yes there is something resembling a plot but for the most part Revenge of the Fallen revolved around this credo: explosion, explosion, explosion and oh yeah Megan Fox is hot. It's just tiring and implausible.

Two of the new characters, a pair of urban-dialect slinging Autobot twins who initially merge into a pink ice cream truck ( . . . ) are quite possibly the most irritating movie characters since Jar Jar Binks. A trio of female Autobots are introduced but factor little into the movie save the opening sequence and finale. The movie's end is just a mess, almost like a fireworks finale where it's just boom boom boom boom. Autobots and Decepticons come and go so quickly you can hardly make out who is who, and of course none of these new characters are ever actually named in the movie.

Oh, and there's a female Decepticon who can transform into a human, in order to seduce Sam Witwicky. I wouldn't have such an issue with this but nothing like that ever took place in the Transformers cartoons or comics. And it seems to me to be a big lift off of what already happened in the Terminator movies.

OK, bottom line- I hated this movie. It was a waste of both my hard earned money and my time. If you haven't seen it yet but have the urgent need to consider this a rental or wait for cable, because I'm sure as with Transformers 1 it will be played ad nauseum by whatever cable channel picks it up.",1252540800,9,1623,4.364238410596027
3441452,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Bad, bad, bad, worse, worse, and even worse than bad! Did i mention that it was bad? It is probably one of THE worse movie ever made! Where to start? The only other worse movie, to me, was ""Batman & Robin"". Michael Bay should imitate Joel Schumacher and apologize to all the people out there. To defend this mess is to sink lower. How can Steven Spielberg (one of the producers) let this happen? I REFUSE to think that he was involved. I'm ready to bet that he was too preoccupied with filming ""Tintin"" with Peter Jackson and he simply trusted Michael Bay. After all, why wouldn't he? The first ""Transformers"" was excellent. How bad could the second one be? Well it's bad.

There is a fine line between parody, comedy and just stupidity. The first movie was right on that line. This one crosses it and is plain dumb.

The characters are stupid. Even for a child watching. I mean, what kind of values are we showing here? Why, oh why, would Megan Fox fall so much in love with Shia's character? What kind of University is that? Can a teacher be so infantile and dumb? How come nobody can see that a big robot is destroying one of the pyramid? Is the army that stupid or what? Should i go on? To try and analyze this is to give the story to much credit. Which it doesn't deserve.

To witness a brilliant actor like John Turturro make a fool of himself this way is very sad. Shameful, pitiful and embarrassing. Almost vulgar in its presumption. It's not even selling one's self to the Devil. It's just loosing prestige. The way he did it in ""The Big Lebowski"" was something amazing. Worthy of his talent. Here, there is no word. Well yes, there is. Sad.

For the first time in my life, i almost walked out of the theatre right in the middle of the movie. I didn't because i didn't want to disturb other people. Michael Bay clearly is a intelligent person. For him to do this just shows that he was condescending to his public. ""We'll just do this and that and they'll buy it"". That sort of thing.

Oh yeah! Megan Fox is truly a beautiful woman and sure, the special effects are dazzling! But who is surprised by that? Every new movie comes with special effects that are always better and better. We expect it. There's got to be more than this. Like an actual story. Or simply a true desire for making a good film. Like the first one.

You know what the worst thing is? Some people are actually defending this thing i dare call a film. Some are even saying that we, who didn't like it, exagerate. That it is only a movie. A pop-corn movie. That it's not a intellectual film. And so on.

That is frightening. And if you don't understand why it is frightening, than THAT is even more frightening.

People, we can't simply justify something crappy by saying ""it's only a movie""! What's wrong with you all? You are watching it for two hours. Do you like to be taken for a fool? There are so many good movies out there, why settle for this and say ""It's only a pop-corn movie""?

Are you that easy to entertain?

If you're gonna respond to that, it'll just depress me more. In this case, you simply don't have the right to defend this movie. You Can't. Sorry. I've decided it for everyone. Think what you will. In this case, i refuse to have an open mind. This is a bad movie. You know it. I know it. It happens.

3441454,1,B0019M5C0Q,"WARNING: Some Spoilers

I went to this movie expecting at least the same of what I got in Transformers 1 (which I didn't mind that much at all), with hope that there would be something better.

Okay...first scene of the movie. Completely blew my mind away. Visually stunning. I was pumped and excited. I had hope that the movie would keep this pace and interest level.

Then I don't know what happened. I was seeing plenty of Autobot actions with the army...
And suddenly, I'm being switched to Sam Witwicky (human protagonist) going off to college. The scene seems innocent enough and the acting of the parents are completely outrageous to cartoon-y which I had assumed were done for the kids. But that thought was gone completely when in the middle of the living room I see two dogs humping.

Voice actor Peter Cullen is hardly a presence in the film as Optimus Prime. Which was the biggest problem I had with Transformers 2. I go wanting to see mainly Optimus Prime, and a quarter-way into the film he gets killed off! The worst part is that this only made the film less interesting for me. Optimus isn't seen until the end where he is given the quickest climatic fight in the entire movie where the rest of the fight scenes are painfully long.

Many of the scenes are dragged out far too long where it could've been cut out. Too much focus on Sam facing college life when they could've focused on the conflict at hand, him being influenced by the AllSpark and seeing visions.

Megan Fox who plays Mikaela is reduced to being an empty character who doesn't do anything but be eye-candy. (She works in a motorcycle repair shop in a mini skirt and tank top--which should explain the realism in this) In the first Transformers, I at least liked how Mikaela played a more stronger character and did things. In here, she mostly just follows Sam around, adds commentary, screams, and runs away. She does single-handed capture a robot, who in return humps her leg.

The Autobots are hardly even seen in this movie except for Bumblebee and two of the worst excuses for Skidds and Mudflap. (gold-toothed robots who can't read, and use slang talk) Their childish banters and 5th grade jokes get old fast. I know there's much heat surrounding these two. But my issue is the fact that the jokes weren't suggestive, it was outright clear caricature to what the joke was pointing at. And also, there's no explanation to why in the world these two robots were acting this way!

Starscream appears as the only highlight of the robots whose characters get slightly developed. Overall, the Transformers have less screen time than in the first film.

The constant-moving of the camera is tiring to the eyes and distracting to the movie. I can't help but view the editing work as sloppy, and cuts away too fast. Also the battle scenes (while a spectacular feast for the eyes) are very very confusing and chaotic. I spent more time trying to figure out who was against who b/c they moved so fast!! (The Autobots were easier to define since they have color bits, but the Decepticons I was hopelessly lost.)

The movie doesn't even shed spotlight or spare any words on the new Autobot characters or Decepticons present.

The comedy maturity of this was erratic. Way down to immature vulgar humor and then completely up to WAY too adult for kids. Honestly, dogs humping, Sam's mother getting high, seeing a man's hairy butt, robot humping, and robot testicles?

Another sign of it not being entertaining was that I was squirming in my seat going into the hour. A good movie for me, is not being able to be aware of my butt sitting. Warning this movie is 2 1/2 hours long!

I am amazed how Micheal Bay and the writers could go wrong with the budget handed to them.
The plot was weak, and some of the things in this movie just didn't make sense or coincide with the first film. Dialogue was very corny in places.

The biggest disappointment of the summer for me. I can only rate it to show my gratitude for the visual and special effects team, artists, and voice actors.

If you enjoy films that focus more on action than plot or want this for the collection, buy it. If you want a more solid story, with a more in-depth reason to care about the characters, then I suggest you rent before buying. Actually I might've liked this better as a rental because I would've been more free to get up and stretch.",1252454400,22,4380,4.5688775510204085
3441455,3,B0019M5C0Q,"When Transformers 1 came out, my wife had to literally DRAG me to the theater to see it, because I was SO worried that it would be a disappointment to a 30-something that grew up watching the G1 cartoons. However, in the end, that movie WAS AWESOME, it EXCEEDED my expectations. The Decepticons were devious, and the Autobots were smart and honorable.

That said, I greatly anticipated, but yet had a little reservation, when Transformers 2 hit theaters. I heard things like, this is Trasformers 1 on steroids, etc. After seeing the movie, those people were right, it is Transformers 1 on steroids. But, in my oppinion, that's all it is, with sex, sexual reference, and Autobots that cuss - where's the honor and role model with them this time?

The plot is VERY thin, find a key that will unock the ultimate weapon for the Decepticons, and hope that the Autobots can stop them before they do. Before long, it is, as another reviewer said, almost no words, just fighting, sexual situations and references, and quick/choppy scenes that has little plot development in the movie itself - it leaves the dots to be connected by the viewer.

Further, I was ANGERED when this movie had to go from entertainment, to another prop to advertise the Left-Agenda of our real-world politics. As an American, I don't want anything to happen to our president - regardless of who it may be, but that said, if a person is wrong - they are wrong, no matter who they are, and that includes the president. That said, the movie names ""Obama"" by name, and in the movie he has sent an advisor to shut-down the most important military operation the world has even known - sound like his real-world agenda of cutting the military? In time however, this gets a little better, because the military more-or-less says ""...forget the president, because he's wrong..."" and dumps his advisor out of an airplane with a parachute, and then mobilizes to save millions despite the president's wishes. In my mind, at least, this made me proud, because the military provides at its own expense the livelihood that we have as Americans, and trying to shut them down is wrong.

I don't know, my feelings are mixed on this, and I may have to watch it again before I can form an oppinion, but right now, I have to say that this is the disappointment that I was woried about when the first movie came out.",1252281600,3,2361,4.627684964200477

No seriously, Transformers 2 is pretty awful. It is 2.5 hours of explosions and super robots and pointless characters and no plot to speak of and a boring, predictable ending. And Megan Fox.

Transformers 2, the sequal, was embarrissingly bad.  No logic to the plot/story at all, crass humor just to be crass, completely goofy story, and lame characters.

The autobot twins were ghetto Jar Jar binks on crack and meth. Annoying beyond belief, and completely unbelievable (how can a glorified midget with a high pitch voice not only escape Devastator, but also severely damage him).

Jetfire was a poorly done character.  They turned one of the most interesting characters from G1 and turned him into a sinile incopetent.

Devastator is completely harmless in this movie, and is EASILY defeated by humans (and damaged by one of the midget twin autobots)

Let me be as consice as I can. If you want to see a movie with a great plot, oscar worthy performaces and an ending that will make you leap out of your seat an applaud. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO! Here is the honest truth about 'Revenge of the Fallen' The acting is the worst I have seen since 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'. I use this movie by comparison for good reason. My intentions for seeing 'Revenge of the Sith' or any of the 3 recent installmets to the Star Wars franchise had nothing to do with the expectations of seeing a movie that was perfect with no equal. No, I just wanted to see a Star Wars movie and get closure I wanted seeing Anakin Skywalker finally become Darth Vader. By the way if you are a reader that had no idea that THAT was the outcome of Star Wars then I should personally slap you around for a bit before you climbed back under the stone you crawled out from for at least 20 years of your life. Now that I have gone completly off topic I will get back to my review. The real reason I wanted to see this highly anticipated Transformers sequel was to see sweet looking plains trains and automobiles turn in to awesome kick keister robots and signature Michael Bay explosions! Also while the plot is about as shallow as the local kiddie pool a true fan of the Transformers cartoon will get a real treat of plot devices from the orgional show. The movie is loud, fun and ficken awesome. Apparently the movie did it's job at the box office because they have green lit the third installment.

3441475,4,B0019M5C0Q,"After reading other peoples reviews I had to make a post.

Most people are complaining about the lack of story which is true. There's basically no storyline what so ever; the first movie had more storyline then this sequel.

The action on the other hand was great; except the action was so fast that you could not see much detail. This lack of detail is a major problem. I think the reason this film ended up the way it did was user feedback.

I would follow the internet forums and other net junk before these films were released; it seemed most wanted more action. The new film filled that.

However the first film had more storyline but not what it should have had, so people asked for more storyline. Some did not care about storyline, and I think it possible that those users won out, and Bay may have thought, ""No storyline, easier it will be to make the sequel"" which would be correct.

Most people just wanted action, action, and more action. This film more then delivered on action. The only problem with the action in the film was that you lost all detail. The way this should have been solved was to do more slow action effects.

I am dying for this video to come out so I can pause through the film to get a better detailed look at the characters. This detailed view of the characters needs to be solved in the next movie and a storyline needs to be settled upon.

The storylines have been many with the transformers, and not all are consistent. I feel strongly that when you develop a character that people will take to a character more. People will want there favorite characters in there possession, so in the end you sell more. Everyone then becomes happier. I have my toy and the greedy industry has there destructive money.

It would be nice to however finally have a official storyline for the Transformers. As far as with people telling you to not watch this movie as it sucked, well I would say don't listen, be your own judge. This is a action movie on a toy line and it delivers for most of what it should for selling toys.

Mr. Bay and Spielberg need to understand that the original kids of this toy line have grown up and want a grown up version of there beloved Transformers. So let's grow up a little and deliver on this once and for all. For now we must wait for the next sequel to see if things improve. This is a work in progress.

If you people want what you want, then start using that dollar to make them deliver. Watch a friend's video and see if you feel this is worth paying for?

For me I say no, I want story line and some better character designs on original characters. Soundwave as a jet I just cant see that, and I am not expecting a cassette recorder either, but jets and cars are really boring compared to other things.

So hoped this review helped someone make a decision. Have a nice day ;-)",1250812800,4,2837,4.332075471698113

There's plenty of characterization in this movie...except the characters just don't sit around a French coffee-house whole time discussing their feelings. Everything happens on the run here.

I've seen it several times at the theater and there's always something new to discover.

It amazes me how Michael Bay has seemingly crammed 3-1/2 hrs worth of movie into 2-1/2 hrs and $400m worth of special effects into $200m. This isn't like one of those other longish movies where you're waiting for something to happen...in 'Revenge' there's always something happening. The pace is breakneck and will keep you on your toes for the duration of the film.

It has something for everybody...especailly the comedy, which comes at you as fast as the action. Kids will giggle at the silly stuff, while teens and adults will guffaw at the rest. The action is insane and you'll be amazed at how seemlessly the robots blend in with the rest of the characters and scenery.

For example Skids and Mudflaps are the comic relief that get a lot of screen time. They unfortunately are batting about 1/20 funny to cringing stupid attempt at a lousy joke. These two get old fast. Now their is the Decepticons which at times are deviously fun. Unfortunately they throw in a plethora of new Decepticons but I couldn't recognize any of them. Most went unnamed and were given sticky note size character development. The Fallen wasn't even in the original series. Ultimately I could have cared less who wins Decepticon or Autobot and that's why Bay failed. Maybe next time they will review the classic cartoon and try and play off some of their story lines. Plus why did they add robot humans??? That was never part of the series. They melted movies like the Terminator, a national lampoons comedy, Indiana Jones and Transformers into one. The end result was yet another dreadful sequel.

Acting (Average or stale): Comedy can be over done and over played. Sam's college roommate regurgitates the same slap stick the whole time. John Turturro along with the Witwiky parents had these over the top jokes that should of been toned down. Most of the Transformers were good minus Skids & Mudflaps. The jokes overall fell flat losing the spark of the first Transformers. Sigh. Why Mr. Bay did one of the little Transformers start humping Miss Fox's leg? Mr. Bay, allowing this over the top humor is totally your fault.

Special effects (Top notch but not enough): Eye candy works best with a great story. Bad story in this flick means eye candy wasn't as much fun. That being said there is a lot of eye poping effects. It mostly amounted to more of the same. Like instead of two Transformers fighting there would be six. So no new ground was covered just a lot more of the old ground from the original Transformers. Despite my critical comments the special effects were the best part of this movie and most likely oscar nomination worthy.
Best parts of Transformers Revenge effects were the forest battle, Decepticon space lair & Decepticons crashing into the sea.

Final thought: My only resolve is that this movie bridges very little from the first Transformers. So I'll skip out on buying number two and hope the third gets it right again. Sad that yet again I'll end up owning another trilogy minus the middle section.

Second take: This review isn't for most younger viewers. Teenagers will mostly like this flick. Also adults who have the emotional depth of a teenager will most likely enjoy this one.",1249948800,10,3476,4.727722772277228

Some language and sexual references that weren't in the first movie, but our 8 year old knows those words aren't acceptable, he told me so :), and to be honest, he remembers the transformers, not what they said. I would still be wary taking children under 13. you've got to know your kids, IMO. my son has seen it 2 times now.",1249862400,11,703,4.579365079365079
3441491,5,B0019M5C0Q,"I wonder what is up with everyone. After the first film, people said that there were not enough transformers in it, there wasn't enough plot, and there wasn't enough action. Now that they finally got what they wanted, they say it's bad? Seriously, they need to get their thoughts straight. Plus, they're saying it was targeted to kids and stuff. However, this movie is based on a show for kids just in case you didn't know. Just get real already.

Now that that's taken care of, let's go onto the review.

I watched this movie on iMax and it was a blast. The special effects, the action, and the plot. They seriously did it the right way. You get to see way more transformers than in the previous movie and bigger ones as well (just like in the anime). There's is also more comedy than before with a bigger plot. Those who watched the anime series would know the connection that exist between humans and the transformers just as shown in the first movie, but it is more solid in the second one. Also, the movie is almost as long as the first one but with more action. They are constantly at war and they tell the story as the continuous war progresses. You've got more involvement of the characters from the first one as well as newcomers from all sides. The special effects are superb. It's like watching Transformers remake with a deeper story.

In conclusion, this movie is accessible to fans of the series as well as people who didn't even watch the first one since they kind of re-tell the events of the first film. We've seen movies like Dragon Ball and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li fail since they try to re-create the story that has already been implanted in the world. Transformers was a little off the edge in the first movie, but in this second film, they really got on track. Well worth your money once it comes out on DVD since I don't think it's playing on theaters anymore.",1249776000,5,1897,4.445402298850575
3441492,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The first movie was awesome. It had great music, entertaining story, great comedy, good drama, and exciting action. While the sequel has better action and nice music, the story takes a turn for the worst, and the comedy is too forced and corny. While it wasn't a complete failure (I've seen it twice) it was still a disappointment.
Seriously though, this movie tried too hard to impress fans with mindless action sequences and forgot about telling a good story, let alone one that makes sense. I would love to get into detail on why the story doesn't makes sense, but I do not want to spoil things in this review. Both the robots and the humans try to be funnier this time around, but it really backfires on them (yes Autobot twins, I'm talking to you). This movie was also TOO LONG! I never complain about length with movies. I often wish most movies were longer. But in this case, I felt as if I was in the theater for 3 1/2 hours.
Even though this movie was a disappointment to me, I would still recommend this film to people. I mean, if you like hot girls, in your face action, and immature comedy, this movie is for you.",1249689600,4,1125,4.3875598086124405

Maybe he should remove some of that metal and replace it with some education.  I'd hate read his job resume.  As for his actual opinion of the movie, that's his opinion.  As we all know, opinions are like butts, everyone has one, and sooner or later they all stink.  By the way, fella, it's about the people AND the bots, okay?  The theme is about how we humans and the bots need to trust each other and work together for a common cause.  As for me, I saw the movie.  Did he?  Really?  I enjoyed it very much.  So did my wife, and she's not nearly the sci-fi fan I am.  She fell in love the the Corvette-bot.  Bumble Bee is my personal favorite.  His expressions - yes, he has them - reminds my wife and me of one of our cats who uses the same kind of guilt-trip looks and sounds when he wants something.  The action factor was waaaaay up over the first Transformers since the characters were established and Michael Bay did not see the need to reindroduce them.  For that, KUDOS!  Way to do it!  I like wall-to-wall action.  This movie is a 2-1/2-hour roller coaster ride.  I really didn't see the need for the mother to get whacked out on those special brownies, but I have to admit it was funny.  I only have one criticism about the show.  STOP THE STUPID, CONDESCENDING SLOW-MOTION CRAP!!!  It does nothing for the movie.  It does NOT intensify an exciting and critical moment but only wrecks it.  Someone, please get this message out to Mr. Bay and all those other action movie producers and directors.  I'm on my knees right now, okay?  That's why I appreciate George Lucas.  Re-examine the light saber fights in the second Star Wars trilogy, the three prequels.  Lightning fast but able to keep up with it.  Slo-mo basically explains the sequence.  I think we're all smart enough not to need it, don't you?  I would have given (not ""would of gave"", Metalhead!) the movie five stars if it weren't for the slow motion sequences.  Still, it's a very worthy effort, expecially with a duffle bag full of fresh popcorn and a 55-gallon drum of soda.

I also love the Camaro. They have beefed it up by adding a bit more black to it.

3441495,3,B0019M5C0Q,"There are times when movies can blow you away.  The first Transformers movie certainly blew me away.  Despite its problems, it was a fun ride with a well crafted story and even some well crafted dialog and sequence of events.  Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, however, shows us that bigger isn't always better.  In fact, bigger can be a headache.  Especially when it's a Michael Bay sequel.

The film brings back Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox as our protagonists.  As it turns out, the Transformers actually came to earth a lot sooner than we thought.  In the year 17,000 BC to be exact.  A war happened involving some of the machines.  As it turns out, the Fallen were sealed... but they may soon rise again.  And Sam (played by Shia) has the key to this, which the Decepticons want to get a hold of.  And quickly.

Anyway, Sam is off to college and as far as he is concerned, Bumblebee's job is done.  His parents are rather emotional over seeing him go (particularly his mother), but things could be worse, right?  Well, as it turns out, when he gets to college he meets a strange guy who has been tracking these ""aliens"" for some time, ever since the incident happened two years ago.  Apparently the Government is so good at covering things up they were able to make sure no one could remember all the chaos that happened right in the middle of the streets of the first film... in broad daylight.  Even stranger is that Sam still has a piece of the cube (All Spark) and despite holding onto it for two years, only now manages to touch it.  When he does, however, he begins to see a bunch of symbols in his head that he doesn't know anything about.

These symbols, however, play  much bigger role than he could imagine.  The Fallen, it turns out, will rise again sometime.  And only one Autobot can stop them... Optimus Prime.  Unfortunately through circumstances it's a wonder if he can.  Even worse is how more decepticons are coming forth and finding most f the good guys.  Not to mention there's another man in the government hoping to mess things up because they believe that it's the fault of the Autobots that the Decepticons are coming in the first place.  And Michael Bay makes sure you really don't like this guy.

Meanwhile, the Decepticons are after Sam because he knows something that's been implanted into his brain.  The end result is that the Autobots along with Sam and Mikeala--and a few supporting characters--have to stop the Fallen from rising again.

On paper it sounds rather simple, but the movie is a lot more convoluted than it actually sounds.  It not so much that the plot makes little sense as it is that it keeps throwing one thing after another into the mix.  By the time the movie concludes you might find yourself having a little too much information.  But more than that, there's a lot of time spent away from the plot.  The first movie, for the most part, had very appropriate jokes that came at just the right moments.  Revenge of the Fallen throws several jokes at a wall hoping something will stick.  You'll get a good share of laughs, but also a lot of jokes that fall flat in the process.

However, it's mostly Michael Bay's filming technique that makes the movie something of a drag.  In many instances the camera angles are incredibly weird and shaky.  When the robots are fighting it's really hard to get into the fight scenes because they're so chaotic and because the camera is constantly jerking around.  More often than not, you lose focus in the middle of the battle.  There are also tons of new robots introduced.  Good and bad.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't give us enough time to get to know any of them.  So much so that in some fights it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad.  Which brings up another thing, the fights themselves can be spectacular, but on the whole they're a little long.  Many moments in the movie are too overdone for their own good.

The story in and of itself comes together but the way it comes together might leave some movie goers feeling cheated in some ways.  If anyone here has ever heard of the term ""Deus Ex Machina"" (which means ""God from the Machine"") then you should know that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is full of them.  In nearly impossible situations, amusing coincidences come into play.  Sam and friends need to get to Egypt upon JUST discovering they need to go there... they magically get there.  They find an old Transformer who is a Decepticon who just happens to have switched sides.  One of the most heart pounding moments of the entire movie is ruined by a Deus Ex Machina that looks as though Michael Bay and company decided to just tack it on.  There's plot and story but a lot of it comes off as an after thought.  Most of i just felt like things they tacked on to make sure that things come out just fine for our protagonists involved.  Every heart pounding moment is immediately crushed when you realize that no matter what happens, none of the characters are in any real danger because of many ""amusing coincidences.""  It makes the movie come as more predictable.

That's not to say it isn't fun.  When you're not being given a headache by the camera work, the special effects are spectacular, and some of the fights are really good.  It's just that its hard to enjoy them because of the awkward camera movements and shifts.  Even Paul Greengras knew when we needed a break.

That's not all, the movie is incredibly long.  Around two and half hours.  But it doesn't quite pass the butt-shifting contest.  A lot of scenes are long and drawn out.  The final battle in and of itself can make you feel like you're sitting through the incredibly long ending of Lord of the Rings.  It's not that it's long which can grate on the nerves so much as it is that Bay and his crew stuffed way too much in a movie.  Suffice to say, how long was this movie supposed to be before it was cut down?  There are so many characters and plot devices introduced that it's a wonder it could all e contained in one film.

The acting, for the most part, isn't really all that bad, but there's far too much acting to care.  This is all about Shia.  Megan Fox is there, but she serves no real purpose other than to give the boys something to stare at between action sequences.

One thing that might raise a few eyebrows however, may be ""The Twins.""  Where would Michael Bay be without ethnic stereotypes?  Here, the Twins are so stereotypical you wonder if Bay was trying to be offensive or funny.  I'm guessing it was the latter option of the two, but the crew on Transformers 2 did go a little overboard with it.
Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a visual spectacle but not much else beyond that.  To put it all in context, it's not hard to understand, but it's definitely cluttered.  And the director does nothing to make sure we care about the characters.  We don't learn much more about them than what the first movie gave us.  There's hardly any development.  It's pleasing to the eye, but little beyond that.",1249516800,8,7017,4.498415213946117

3441504,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is, in a nutshell, a special effects extravaganza without any discernible story. You get more transforming robots, but no character(s) you can relate to. There are lots of actions and battles between the good and evil, but you just can't tell which is which, watching the hectic movements of the CG-created transformers that would make you dizzy.

The fierce fight with the Decepticon forces continues in ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" This time the evil robots are planning something much more damaging to the Earth, and humans and autobots, or good robots, must stop them before it is too late. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox reprise their roles as Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. Sam is going to college, leaving his gorgeous girlfriend in his hometown, but soon Sam learns that he has accidentally got a secret that the evil Decepticon leader really needs.

Well, this is only the introduction. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" runs about 150 minutes and the story defies easy summary simply because the story is actually non-existent. Like the two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequels, the film takes up the story that should have ended in the original. Instead, the filmmakers have added new characters (humans and transformers), new locations and long, extended action sequences that are bigger and louder than before.

Actually, this is not a bad thing. After all Michael Bay films (such as ""Pearl Harbor"" ""Armageddon"" ""The Rock"" and two ""Bad Boys"") have been known for actions and most of us are aware of that. To his credit, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" provides tons of actions with first-rate visual effects though I prefer less shaky camerawork.

Sadly Michael Bay (and producer Steven Spielberg) has forgotten one important thing. Transformers are characters with their own personalities, not just machines. In the original ""Transformer"" the director tried to present them as characters and succeeded to some extent, in some of the scenes like comical interaction between Bumblebee (as a Camaro) and a human friend, Sam. In fact Shia LaBeouf's Sam was a pretty interesting character in the first ""Transformer,"" but here he just sleepwalks or overacts.

In the sequel two new smaller Autobots appear as comic relief, but they sound more like two Jar Jar Binks. More irritating is Sam's parents, especially his mom, who goes berserk in the campus. Michael Bay (and Spielberg) was never good at doing comedy and he overreaches himself when he tries to make us laugh.

I don't think they were too bad just some scenes were cheesed up too much but they were certainly not enough to warrant saying it was a bad film once you can let go and look beyond them and see that there is more, much more than meets they eye to Revenge of the Fallen!
I won't go in to who what when and where a lot of the other reviews did that already but there is certainly much more story and plot which no it is not perfect but it has certainly improved upon the 2007 film but they did not have the time or budget to do what they wanted to to so they gave us much more this time around. There are many nods to the the G1 days as well as the comic book fans which is where the Fallen comes from as well as much better robot characterization, more robot screen time, more robots in general but not all have speaking lines or major roles so don't go in expecting fire side chats between the major robot characters that do have the most screen time but there are still some great scenes between the Fallen, Megatron and Starscream.

3441507,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael Bay, what went wrong?

""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" suffers from sequelitis big time. It almost seems as though Bay decided that whatever worked in the first ""Transformers"" film had to be bigger, louder, more frantic, more hectic and less human in this new sequel. And more of it. A lot more.

The first ""Transformers"" was a surprising film. Infused with a significant amount of character and story, the film used newfound star Shia LaBeouf and made him the center of the film. Because he was so good, the loud, frantic whirling special effects seemed better somehow. They made sense. And the relationship between LaBeouf's character and Megan Fox's character seemed sweet somehow, something we can all relate to. Bay layered in the usual special effects, allowing him to play with his toy box, but they actually contributed to the story and were cool to watch.

All of this helped the first ""Transformers"" become a huge hit. When a sequel became inevitable, Bay apparently decided to just add more and more and more to the new film. Bigger is better, right?

But all of these additional elements only serve to make the new film everything the first film wasn't. Loud, obnoxious, confusing, repetitious and filled with two-dimensional characters.

Picking up a few months after the first film ended, Sam (LaBeouf) is headed to college and his parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn) are ready for a trip to Europe. Sam is distraught at the prospect of leaving Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind and they have an argument about who will say ""I Love You"" first. Before he leaves for school, he spots a piece of the All Spark, the object the Transformers were fighting over in the first film, causing him to see symbols everywhere. The All Spark fragment also wakes up some Transformers who soon start to attack Mikaela before she quickly subdues them. When Sam arrives at school, the symbols continue to distract him. Before you can say ""Optimus Prime"", we learn that a new leader of the Decepticons (or old depending on how you look at it) the Fallen has come back and taken control. He leads the Decepticons in an all out battle to find Sam and Mikaela and learn what he knows. They think the symbols will lead them to an ancient resting place for their ancestors, an ancient resting place hiding a power that will allow them to take over the Earth. Naturally, Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and the other Transformers have something to say about that. The US Government has set up a special ops unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) to work with Optimus Prime and his team to hunt down Decepticons hiding across the globe. As we watch a lengthy prologue, it becomes apparent they have been around for a long time. After a destructive chase through Shanghai, a US Senator manages to convince the President to let him take over the unit. And all he wants to do is shut them down. So Lennox and Epps have to work to keep him at arms length. Eventually, as Sam and Mikaela try to figure out what the symbols mean and how to avoid the Decepticons, they run across an old friend (John Turturro) who now works in a deli. Soon, everyone is headed to Egypt.

Does this synopsis sound as confusing to you as it does to me? And I've seen the film. This is a big part of the problem with ""Fallen"". There is too much going on and little of it makes sense.

There is a lengthy prologue showing the Fallen leading a group of Decepticons to Earth and battling with cavemen. This is kind of a neat idea and helps to set up the rest of the film. I guess Bay was bored by this sequence, as it is ostensibly just narrative, because this is immediately followed by a lengthy action sequence set in Shanghai. Lennox, Epps, Optimus Prime and the other Transformers are hunting a Decepticon. When they find the bad Transformer, all hell breaks loose and they chase the renegade through the busy, crowded streets. During the chase, many buildings and a freeway are destroyed. This sequence is fun to watch, but later, you begin to wonder what role it plays in the overall film. It doesn't seem to have a lot of connection, except to introduce us to new Transformers, and to reintroduce us to the robots we have already met. More on this later. The sequence, while fun to watch, ultimately just seems like a waste of time. And when a film like this runs two hours and thirty minutes, time isn't something you want to waste. More on that later.

Perhaps the worst thing about ""Fallen"" is the waste of the actors. No one shows any emotion and everyone seems to be simply walking through the story. We have seen this from Bay before, he has never been very interested in character development or story, preferring to make things blow up, but after the first ""Transformers"" film, I held out some hope that he would continue to learn and continue to improve his storytelling technique. At one point, Mikaela cries and Bay lingers his camera on her face to capture the teardrop, almost as though he is trying to prove he can capture emotion.

I'm not entirely sure ""Fallen"" is appropriate for young children. The first time we see Mikaela (Fox) she is literally draped across the top of a motorcycle, her butt barely covered in denim short shorts, her blousy shirt revealing a tight t-shirt inside. The composition almost seems like a parody of a Maxim cover. Apparently, she now works at a motorcycle shop detailing the top of the chassis. This apparently requires her to get real close, forcing her to lay on top of the motorcycle, the big engine between her bent legs. Later, after Sam arrives at college, another beautiful young lady, Alice (Isabel Lucas), starts to throw herself at Sam. As soon as this storyline began to play out, I could just see the filmmakers looking at her audition tape. ""She is HOT"". Later, when a twist occurs, the story makes some lewd references and she makes some strange gestures. Not exactly appropriate for little kids.

I defy just about anyone to remember what most of the Transformer's names are. Beyond the few central characters (Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee, Megatron), there are simply too many of them and they don't look or act differently enough to make it easy to recognize them. Given the level of cacophony, it is near impossible to hear them address each other. So this limits the number of characters we can follow to about half the number on screen. Of those, again another half are distinct enough to make us care about them. What is the point of adding so many characters when it is all but impossible to follow them, to make any sense of them?

Of the new additions, two seem particularly problematic. During the Shanghai sequence, we see a beaten up ice cream truck participating in the action. When the truck breaks apart into two transformers (I think), they begin talking in a highly characterized 'jive' talk. Later, these robots get an upgrade and transform into two different 'Scion' like cars. I have heard these characters referred to as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. It is a pretty good analogy. They are insulting characters and only serve to bring the quality of the rest of the film down.

Later in the film, they meet an old British Decepticon (I'm not kidding) who served in World War II as a bomber but has now switched sides. They find him in the Smithsonian and... oh, well, do you really want to read about story points that make little or no sense?

With the two beginning sequences and an extremely long sequence set in Egypt to close the film, ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" seems long. As soon as the Egypt plotline began, and we begin to watch LaBeouf and Fox running through the desert sand, my companion turned to me and said ""Doesn't this seem familiar?"" An accurate assessment as much of the beginning of the first film concerns Lennox and Epps fighting the Decepticons in another desert. Repetition is not a good thing in film and only serves to make this film seem longer.

Worse yet, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is nowhere to be found which leads Bay and his writers to come up with a new villain. They look back, you might say way back, and come up with the Fallen. He resembles a cross between a transformer and Alien. This is a little ironic as Bay recently feuded with director McG over ""Terminator Salvation"", claiming some of his new Terminators resembled Transformers. Michael, It appears that he is not the only director to receive inspiration from others.

""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is the second most disappointing film of the summer. ""Terminator Salvation"" is the first.",1247875200,27,8587,4.666226040978189
3441508,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Sequel to 2007's Transformers robot aliens sci-fi actioner. This time our hero Sam Witwicky (played again by Shia LaBeouf) and his plucky girlfriend Mikaela Banes (played again by Megan Fox) are being pursued by the evil Decepticon Transformers because Sam has information in his brain about the location of a lost Transformer artifact known as the Matrix of Leadership (buried somewhere on the earth) which holds the key to unlocking the Sun Harvester, a weapon of unspeakable power used in the distant past by Prime Transformer robots to cause stars to explode so that the energy from these explosions could be converted to power Cybertron (the Transformers' planet of origin)'s AllSpark (the life force of the Transformers). The Sun Harvester is located somewhere on the earth and if activated will cause our sun to explode, destroying the earth in the process and wiping out mankind. Behind this dastardly plan is a rogue Prime Transformer and former brother of the leader of the benevolent Autobot Transformers Optimus Prime, who rebelled against the code of the Prime Transformers (which states that the Sun Harvester should only be used on uninhabited suns to prevent loss of life) and who as a result is now and forever known as The Fallen. But with Optimus Prime recently slain in battle, there is no Autobot powerful enough to defeat the Fallen (as only a Prime can stand up to him), so the earth is doomed, unless Sam can somehow use the Matrix of Leadership to resurrect the dead Optimus Prime. But with the Decepticons determined to stop Sam at all costs, Sam's efforts just may cost him his life.

Comments: this was a most fun movie that just got better as it went on. The action scenes are as spectacular as in the first Transformers movie and the plot is as big as it gets: saving the earth from destruction. Leading man Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky matures much in this movie and Megan Fox's character Mikaela Banes is as resourceful as she is beautiful. And lest we forget the robot characters are called `Transformers' for a reason: the various scenes where robot characters transform from earthly vehicles into their true forms will take your breath away and are a marvel of modern CGI. This is how you do a big summer robot blockbuster movie, although I do have a few criticisms: some of the humour in this film doesn't really work and often when the Transformers are fighting because the camera is held so close to the action you often can't see exactly what is going on. This film may be based on Hasbro toy characters but the plot is pleasingly complex and there is a depth to this film that exceeds that of the first film, as well as the tale of man overcoming his mistrust of beings from other worlds to stand with alien allies against mutual enemies. That and a clear multi-million dollar budget (some of the robot special effects in this film are unbelieveable) makes this a must see film, arguably even better than the other two big sci-fi films of summer 2009, Terminator: Salvation and Star Trek.

3441511,4,B0019M5C0Q,"The Story:
Picking up two years after the end of the last movie, Revenge of the Fallen begins with the Autobots, working with their human allies, led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel), hunting down the few remaining Decepticons on Earth. The alliance, called NEST, tracks down two in an industrial part of Shanghai, China and manage to dispatch the pair, but not before receiving a warning that ""the Fallen shall rise again."" Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to go off to college, ready for a ""normal"" life after his action in Mission City and struggling to maintain his relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox), who is staying behind. However, an encounter with a fragment of the shattered Allspark will again thrust Sam into the middle of the centuries-long war between the Cybertronian factions.

The Good:
I want to first comment on something that isn't related to the movie's content, but I think is worth mentioning: seeing this film on IMAX is an experience worth the $[...] I paid to get in. I've been to IMAX films before, but they've all been documentaries in museums, not Hollywood blockbusters. I had tried to see the last Star Trek film at my local IMAX theater, but as I mentioned before, if you don't get those tickets at least the day before, you're not getting one at all. I'm glad I got my ticket the day before, because every seat in the theater was filled by the time the film started, which pretty much started at the time advertised. Aside from the usual courtesy notices, I didn't have to sit through fifteen minutes of commercials and trailers before the film started (thank God, really, I don't think I could stand watching that hideous trailer for G.I. Joe again). There are rumors that the IMAX version of Revenge has scenes that aren't in the regular theatrical release, but having not seen the regular release, I can't compare the two. I did note that the scene with Sam Witwicky's phone conversation with Mikaela and her subsequent discovery of Wheelie had dialogue not shown in the Internet sneak peaks I'd seen before the movie's release, but how that differs from the theatrical release, I couldn't say. I highly recommend catching this film in an IMAX theater if you have the opportunity, before the distributors move on to the next Hollywood blockbuster - if they haven't already.

Moving on to the movie's content, I'll start off with the action in the film, which, as most people know, is practically Michael Bay's trademark. Say what you will about Bay's directing style, but the film's action sequences are intense, quick, and managed to hold my attention. Yes, there's still the ""shaking camera"" effect that is prevalent in modern action films, and some of the scenes fly by in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" fashion, but at least this time you get to see who's who in a fight. The best action scenes are during the fight in Shanghai, the three on one fight in some unnamed forest in New York (or New Jersey, it better be one of the two), and the final battle between NEST and the Decepticons in Egypt. You wanted more robot fights, well Bay and the writers give you more robot bashings. Watching Sideswipe slice Sideways in half in Shanghai was a great scene (I agree with Sideswipe, he is good) but it's Optimus Prime (voiced by the legendary Peter Cullen) who gets to shine in this film. From taking on a Decepticon nearly five times his size, fighting off three Decepticons at once, and even taking on the titular god-like ancient known as the Fallen (given voice by Tony Todd of Candyman fame), it's clear that the writers and director intended to make Prime a tougher character, and to an extent, they may have succeeded too well here. There have been criticisms by some fans that Prime displayed no such fighting talent in the first film and that Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), despite having been resurrected in a theoretically more powerful form, switches to the role of punching bag with Prime. I'd like to point out that Prime does basically wail on Bonecrusher in the first film and was fighting the climactic battle with Megatron in the middle of a crowded major population center. In the latter case, it is possible Prime was holding back in that fight out of concern for harming innocents, while Megatron, of course, would have no such concerns. It should also be pointed out that Prime has had two years to hone his combat skills, while Megatron has been rusting on the ocean floor for that time and now has to get used to an essentially brand new body. The two big fights between Prime and Megatron occur in more sparsely populated and open areas, giving former the chance to go all out without concerning himself with collateral damage.

One of the criticisms leveled at the first film was the lack of characterization with the robot characters and too much focus on the humans. Humans still play a large part in Revenge, but there are very few additions to the human cast in this film. The only new addition that has any significant screen time is the character of Leo Spitz (Ramn Rodrguez); most of the other new additions play only a minor role or are limited to cameos. Instead, the filmmakers chose to introduce more personalities into the Transformers themselves, though most of it is focused on some of the newer Autobots. The most obvious examples are the twins Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson), who have been the focus of accusations that they are ""annoying"" at their mildest, at worst "" promoting negative racial stereotypes."" I'll admit, their faces are ugly, their manner of speaking is questionable, and they spend most of their screen time arguing and fighting with each other (Bumblebee even has to knock some sense into them at one point). But I didn't find them half as annoying as some fans and most critics claimed - I'll admit, I laughed at some of their comments and antics.

One character I was pleasantly surprised with was that of Jetfire, the old Decepticon turned Autobot. As with Bumblebee in the first movie, I was a little nervous when I heard that Jetfire would be a ""geriatric"" robot with rusting, crumbling parts and a memory core that likely needs defragging. But the writers, animators and voice actor Mark Ryan manage to successfully depict the character whose gone a little too long without energon and a visit to a CR chamber. The fact that he transforms into an SR-71 Blackbird, one of the most popular aircraft to have been developed and current speed record holder, doesn't hurt - though farting out a parachute is probably pushing it a little bit. I'm also curious as to why the VA was changed from John Turturro (reprising his role of Agent Simmons (retired)) as earlier report to Mark Ryan, but that's a minor quibble. I won't say that my eyes started to tear up when Jetfire sacrificed himself to give Prime an edge against the Fallen - it didn't - but it is a nobler and more touching death than that of Jazz in the first film.

Another, rather surprising, breakout was that of the character Wheelie, a name that is perhaps the most universally reviled within the fandom. Before this film, the name had only been used once, for a character introduced in the 1986 animated film known for his rhyming manner of speaking, high-pitched voice, and a rather simplistic toy that isn't considered the best ever made. Personally, I've neither liked nor disliked the character, but any new incarnation could only be considered an improvement. Wheelie of Revenge of the Fallen is definitely a vast improvement over his original counterpart. Voiced by Tom Kenny and transforming into a RC truck, his accent and personality is much closer to that of Rattrap from Beast Wars than his namesake. Wheelie gets some of the best lines in the movie and he comes off much scrappier than his toy bio indicates, though ""Warrior Goddess"" Mikaela still manages to kowtow him. At least one of his antics could have been changed drastically, but overall, the writers manage to make this Wheelie work.

Most of the Decepticons in the movie are again limited to growls, grunts, and other sounds, as they were in the first Transformers. A few, like Demolisher and Soundwave, have lines, but the lion's share of dialogue is taken up by the Fallen, Megatron, and Starscream. Hugo Weaving is again perfect as this ""universe's"" Megatron, reprising the sinister, growling tone he used in the first movie - and this time, he gets more to do. He also get's one of the best lines in the film: ""Starscream, I'm home!"" Charlie Adler reprises his role as Starscream and we get more characterization from the Decepticon lieutenant than his two lines in the first movie hinted at. It's clear that Adler is at least attempting to channel a little bit of Chris Latta into his performance, and while he doesn't quite get the tone, he does manage to get Starscream's classic sniveling, cowardly, scheming personality down. The audience is also treated to the classic, dysfunctional relationship between Megatron and Starscream, right down to Megatron's berating, and even physical abuse against his lieutenant for ""his"" failures.

As a long time fan of Transformers, I have to say it is a pure joy that Frank Welker joins the cast reprising his role as Soundwave. I was a little disappointed that Soundwave talks with the unmodified ""Dr. Claw"" voice; the classic voice would have fit well in this universe, I think. However, I can accept that it isn't modified, especially since its Welker voicing Soundwave. The character does little outside of coordinating the other Decepticons from orbit, intercepting transmissions, and launching Ravage towards Diego Garcia - then again, he didn't do much more than that in the original cartoon. Speaking of Ravage, he was a character I couldn't wrap my mind around when I first saw his design. I'm still not keen on his spiky, cycloptic appearance, but his actions acquit his physique. He definitely a dangerous, deadly opponent, as witnessed when he covers the ""Reedman"" bot from the Deigo Garcia personnel and again when he takes on Bumblebee while he's fighting Rampage. It's just too bad Bumblebee gets the better of him - gruesomely. However, Soundwave has apparently survived, giving me hope that Laserbeak may make an appearance in the next film.

The Bad:
There are a lot of good things with Revenge of the Fallen, but there are plenty of things that were wrong with the movie. The most obvious is that lack of exposure for some of the characters, both new and old. Soundwave, as mentioned above, has relatively little screen time, though that could be a function of where he's situated throughout the film. Most of the Constructicons have no dialogue at all: Rampage has a voice credit, but I don't recall him actually saying anything - it's possible it was lost in all the background noise. For the Autobots, most of the screen time is taken up by Optimus Prime, the Twins, and Bumblebee (Mark Ryan), whose back to speaking through his radio despite regaining his voice in last movie. By contrast, returning Autobots Ironhide (Jess Harnell) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) have even less lines in this movie than they did in the last one. In addition, new Autobots Sideswipe (Andr Sogliuzzo), the Arcee trio (Grey DeLisle) and Jolt have little screen time and few lines - in Jolt's case, no lines. It would have been nice to have at least devoted a little more time to fleshing out the new characters a little. In Jolt's case; it would have been nice to have included him in a few more scenes than the mere two he was in, especially some of the fight scenes.

Speaking of characters, Scalpel, simply referred to as ""Doctor"" in the film and voiced by John Di Crosta, is great character in concept and his actions. Sure would have been nice, though, if I could have been able to understand what he was saying. Between his thick faux German accent and whatever electronic modulation is being used (if any), Scalpel's dialogue comes across more as constant buzzing than a coherent sentence. Occasionally I could understand a word or two, but it would have been better if they had just dropped the mad German scientist shtick.

Being a Michael Bay flick, the addition of a hot chick or two to serve as eye candy for his arguably mostly male audience is a given. Revenge of the Fallen is no different, with Megan Fox reprising her obligatory role as eye candy Mikaela from the original movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the writers or the director quite knows what to do with the character this time around. At least in the first movie, Mikaela has her use beyond giving Sam (the boys in the audience) something to drool over: she sliced Frenzy's head off and first towed a wounded Bumblebee out of and then back into a combat zone - under fire no less. While she does manage to wrangle Wheelie and run Alice over with a car, both of these actions are a far cry from charging at the heavily armed, hulking Decepticon that was Brawl. Like newcomer Leo, Mikaela just seem to be along for the ride in this movie, occasionally arguing with Sam, mostly over who should say ""I love you,"" and even becoming a naysayer at the Tomb of the Primes. While I can't see the film without her, I think the writers should have found a way to make her more - useful.

Speaking of eye candy, introducing Isabel Lucas as the Decepticon "" Pretender "" Alice seemed like a good idea, but more I think about her scenes in the movie, the more I think she served only two purposes - rather freaky eye candy and a cheap way to get Sam, Mikaela, and Leo off campus and somewhere that Grindor, the carbon copy of Blackout from the first film, can grab them. Personally, a trip to the local park might have been a better means of doing that. Pretenders were initially introduced during the ""Generation One"" period, though they've become rather obscure in recent years. Reintroducing the concept into this film seemed like a good idea and the effects are excellent, if a little Terminator-esque, but Alice's overall inclusion just seems superfluous. In addition, the character comes off as a little too aggressive and overt towards Sam; I think even a Decepticon would be able to be more subtle. I will say that I enjoyed Bumblebee beating on her when she hitched a ride with him and Sam, and even his attempts to give Sam hints that she wasn't what she seemed, appropriately playing ""Superfreak"" at one point.

Another staple of Bay films is the inclusion of a usually half-baked romance between the principle male and female characters. The relationship started between Sam and Mikaela in the first film continues in this one - and is about as unnecessary to the plot as in the first one. Sam and Mikaela spend most their time together arguing about something; who's going to say ""I love you"" before Sam goes off to college and again when spending a night under the Great Pyramids. They have unrelated argument as they're trying to hide from Alice's rampage, when Mikaela thinks Sam was cheating on her - though this one was more legit, since Mikaela had no idea that Alice was, quite literally, the aggressor. Fortunately, the love story doesn't overwhelm the story, but like Alice, it's a bit redundant.

Disappearing characters are minor annoyance in the film as well. Most blatant of these is Barricade from the first movie, who disappeared right before Bonecrusher transformed to take on Prime and was never seen again. It's not unreasonable to assume that he fell victim to the NEST alliance in the intervening years, but I still find it to be a glaring oversight on the part of the filmmakers. Barricade could have been used in the Shanghai battle in place of Sideways, just to explain his fate, and Sideways used as the means by which the Decepticons capture Sam instead of Grindor and Alice. Another character who disappears without explanation is Scalpel, who vanishes after Prime and Bumblebee break into the warehouse where the Decepticons are about to dissect Sam. The comic adaptation has Prime shoot Scalpel into pieces when the latter breaks in and it's not a far stretch that Scalpel could have been caught in the melee and crushed. The final character to slip into the editing void is Wheelie, who is apparently just left in the Egyptian desert after Sam, Mikaela, Leo, Simmons, Bumblebee and the Twins head off to Giza. It would have been nice to have added him to the brief epilogue scenes before the credits, just to know what happens. Characters that disappear without explaination is a familiar, though annoying, phenomenon in the Transformers franchise, so we really shouldn't expect the movies to be any different. Still, it would be nice sometimes if the writers could tie up loose ends.

The Expendable:
Crude jokes were present in the first Transformers film and they're present in Revenge of the Fallen as well. Low blow humor isn't exactly new to the series - anyone remember ""The Low Road"" from Beast Wars? Still, some of the humor in the film seemed unnecessary, and some of it shouldn't have even been considered. One example is the scene where Jetfire reveals that he switched sides, prompting Wheelie to do the same - and right after, Wheelie proceeds to ""hump"" Mikaela's leg. I'll admit, I wasn't surprised by it - I had read about in the sole fan review I saw - and I did laugh, but after two similar scenes with the Witwicky mutts, this was just one scene too many. That scene could have been written with something better to showcase Wheelie's... enthusiasm.

Another scene of low blow humor that could have been excluded was just after Sam's group arrives at the Smithsonian Air & Space Udvar-Hazy Annex. As he prepares to infiltrate the museum, Simmons removes his pants to reveal - that he's wearing a thong. Not only is this rather disturbing sight revealed to the audience, but it's done so at extreme close up, butt crack and all. Mr. Bay, if in the extremely unlikely event you happen to be reading this, I know you like to appeal to the high school and college set who think this kind of thing is funny, but was this scene really necessary? The majority of the audience in the theater I was in emitted a very loud groan when this scene appeared (and they say modern movie audiences have no taste).

Let's make one thing clear: I like this Devastator. I like him the first time I saw him in action in the initial trailers, even if he looked like Unicron's ugly stepchild. I can forgive the fact that he doesn't really do all that much actual fighting in the film. I can accept the idea that he's so heavy that he is forced to walk like a giant mechanized gorilla. I can even accept the idea his components have copies that don't make up the Gestalt - evidenced by the fact that Long Haul, Rampage, and Mixmaster are all wandering around while Dev's doing his best impression of King Kong on the pyramid. Unfortunately, someone - the director, the writers or a bored animator at ILM - decided to give Devastator a pair of brass balls - literally. These ""robo-testicles,"" first noticeable when this behemoth starts climbing the pyramid, look like they're made from wrecking balls, which is odd considering none of his components are vehicles that carry such a tool. He does have a crane that forms his arm that could explain one ball, but two? And why isn't it on his arm instead of between his legs? Granted, this kind of ""humanization"" is not new in Transformers, but it's been mostly limited to female Transformers characters (which, in a species of alien robots, is questionable in and of itself). Overall, Devastator's balls are a strange and extraneous physical feature that only serves to give Simmons a shot at cracking a lewd joke at the giant's expense.

Lastly, the award for most expendable element or character in the film has to go to Jolt, the eleventh hour addition to an arguably already crowded cast, and glaringly so. Jolt doesn't even show up until the about midway through the movie, and all he does is stand around in the background, weapons crackling. He shows up one more time, just before Prime takes on the Fallen, using his whips to basically magnetize Optimus and Jetfire's remains so that the two merge. In my opinion, if the filmmakers were going to spend the time and money creating the CGI model for the character, they could have at least put him in a few more scenes. They could have initially introduced him greeting the NEST team as they returned from Shanghai and added him to a couple of the battle scenes, just to justify the cost of his CGI model. I do have hope that Jolt will have a larger role in the next movie, especially since the apparent demise of Jetfire and Arcee has thinned the Autobot cast slightly. Unfortunately, it's more likely that poor Jolt will disappear into the same writing void that claimed Barricade.

Final Thoughts:
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a fun film to watch, especially in an IMAX format, and is arguably better than its predecessor - a rarity for any film sequel. It does have problems that could have been fixed with a little refinement in the writing, but let's face facts shall we? This is a movie that's A) based on a toy line, B) based on a series of cartoon series, C) directed by Michael Bay. If you're expecting something with the quality of a Sundance Festival film, you're in the wrong building. Still, I believe it was worth my $11.",1247529600,3,21391,4.721092077087794
3441512,5,B0019M5C0Q,"Just saw it today and I know I am buying this movie.  But I don't understand the negative reviews.  This movie is the best movie I have seen so far this summer (I've seen Wolverine, Star Trek, Angles and Demons, Phalam 123).  This was a very entertaining movie with good story line.  It did not have an overbearing love story and it did not have annoying comic relief (ie-jar jar in star wars I - trust me the twins were not annoying).  Plenty of actions and smooth transition from scene to scene.  Of course CGI was awesome.  I bet people who did not like this movie are the same ones who said ""Crying Game"" and ""Queen"" were awesome movies.  Just want to let you know I could not finish either movies mentioned before.  One thing to remember from my review is the entertainment value.  If you liked the first movie and if you like action movies, then Transformer 2 will not disappoint.  If I were you, I would watch this in theater  (IMAX preferred). Definitely an excellent movie and a definite BUY for me. Hope this helped.",1247529600,4,1026,4.427807486631016

3441514,2,B0019M5C0Q,"The first transformer movie was very entertaining and I expected this one to follow suite: a little campy, but full of heart, awesome robots, and a story that can drive it all forward. Sadly, REVENGE OF THE FALLEN watches like a thirteen-year old's wet-dream version of the original. We have more Transformers (like 4x more), more fighting, more hot women in tight clothes, more explosions, more Shia delivering stupid lines, and more silly body humor (Micheal Bay: Robots don't fart, or have gold teeth, or hump people's legs, nor is there a 'robot heaven' !?!).

I guess the question I left the theater asking myself is this what people really want? Do moviegoers just want sequel after sequel that only adds to the franchise by cramming in more stuff? Has the 'more is always better' theory started to dominate film making to such an extent that we'll go gladly dump our money (myself included) on a movie this poorly made just because it promises more flash special effects and lots of explosions? I hope this isn't true, but judging by this movie's success at the box office, it just might be.

Other reviewers have adequately described most of the major problems with the film, but there were a few things that actually made me sad watching REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. The first and primary is that Optimus Prime (probably the coolest Transformer in my opinion) is given very few lines--a major mistake considering he is the only 'serious' Transformer, and voiced by a fantastic voice actor who dates back to the original Transformers cartoon. The film reveals that he is the very last 'Prime' Transformer, the most powerful that exist in the universe. This could be a remarkably cool story in itself, but the film is so filled up with other nonsense that Optimus is left on the sidelines (literally due to one of the most anticlimactic action sequences of the film which leaves him incapacitated). He is the voice of moral authority and wisdom in the original series, in the previous Hollywood offering, and in REVENGE as well. So why give him so few lines and why leave his character undeveloped?

Another sad thing is the brazenly idiotic portrayal of The Twins, two 'ghetto' robots who can't read, speak in jive, act like punks, and generally are such an idiotic stereotype that it makes you wonder what Michael Bay was thinking, and how they could even make it into the final version of the film. They add nothing but the lowest of low-brow humor all while being racial stereotypes of the worst variety. I mean come on, a gold toothed robot? Seriously?

The plot line is a mad dash from one end of the film to the other, with very little room for any real character development to take place. Much screen time is given to massive robot battles in which it is sometimes pretty hard to tell which Transformer is which, and who is in fact winning. The MORE phenomenon really sinks the ship here because I found myself losing interest in what was happening simply because it was too hard to keep track of who was an Autobot and who was a Decepticon.

A film overpopulated with robots, unnecessary characters, and crammed full of as many explosions as possible, the movie left me feeling tired and frustrated. It's likely there will be a third Transformer installment in the future, and if Michael Bay directs, it boggles the mind trying to think of ways he could up the ante on action and poorly designed story. Perhaps he'll opt for 90 minutes of robots blowing the hell out of everyone and everything and skip the story entirely. If he does that, it might actually be better than this piece of garbage.

1.5/5 Stars.",1247356800,18,3620,4.701892744479495
3441515,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Well, the potential was there, but once again Bay over-exaggerated stereo types and continues to believe big explosions outweigh the importance of plot and reality.  For example, is every single woman in Bay's universe a goddess from Paradise Island?  Would our hero's girl really be seductively sprawling out over a motorcycle with no one around but her FATHER?  In order to give some of the characters a bit of ""edge"" do we really want to believe they'd sound like uneducated ghetto-bots?  The ""Twins"" were more like Jar Jar meets C3PO in Harlem.  For me there is nothing worse than sophisticated robots acting like our society at its uneducated worse--racial clichs, foul language, and LEG HUMPING!  Yes, a transformer that dry humps a girl's leg!  Bay left nothing to the imagination this time.  He even gave us a giant set of robot testicles.  Thanks Michael, ""You're a genius!""

As I continue to rant and rave...um I mean offer constructive criticism...when's the last time you've been to a frat party?  Did it look ANYTHING like what Bay envisions?  I have to wonder if he's ever been on a college campus.  Once again, in Bay's universe, all ""hot chicks"" are horny and the jocks are brick-stupid bullies.  Government officials are stubborn, uniformed boobs, who one would have to wonder how they ever got put in that position in the first place.  Being in the military myself, I found it very insulting how government officials treated our military.  Ripping off someone's rank in the manner Galloway did would NEVER happen (at least not in public fashion).  Oh, and for the record there is absolutely NO WAY Tech Sergeant Epps would go from an E-5 (TSgt) to an E-9 (CMSgt) in TWO YEARS no matter how ""Classified"" the project was.  I won't delve too far into the military faade depicted in this movie, but I do have to mention I was almost excited for a moment.  When the predator was taking off they actually got it right--it's, after all, propeller driven.  Then as it arrived on scene it was once again JET PROPELLED!  I think Bay infused the Predator with the Global Hawk to make it cooler for the uninformed viewer.

My last gripe would be the apparent lack of time in this film.  The characters seemed to move freely through space and time (maybe they had an upgraded flux capacitor).  In Bay's Universe it only takes a camera shift to go from Saturn to Earth, from Diego Garcia to the East Coast, from the East Coast to the Middle East, and all countries in the Middle East are as close as your neighborhood convenient store.  Having flown across the Atlantic more times than I'd care to count let me tell you--It's an ALL DAY event.  Add the extra day it would take to get to the Indian Ocean and you have one LONG movie--oh wait, this was 2  hours.  My bad.

Well, this has already gone on longer than I had intended so I'll end with; the explosions were fun, the transformers looked amazing (aside from the Twins), the acting was as good as it could be given the script, and Bay was...well, BAY!",1247356800,11,3012,4.630188679245283

An action packed adventure from Director Michael Bay. The Autobots and Decepticons continue their civil war on Earth. The Decepticons are searching for the Matrix of Leadership, a tool which can be used to harvest energy to recreate Cybertron in their own image. The Autobots have allied themselves with N.E.S.T, an international group of human soldiers dedicated to protecting Earth from the Decepticons. When The Fallen, one of the original 13 Transformers, revives Megatron and sends him to capture Sam Whitwiky (Shia LeBouf), the Autobots and Decepticons battle for control. The film delivers on a truly epic scale with lots of Robots fighting, explosions and a worthy adventure. This movie assaults the mind on several levels, but is easy to follow.

- Action, action, and more action.
- This movie must hold the record for the most things blown up in a movie.
- Main characters weren't too bad to look at.
- Special effects were kinda cool.

- The mother being attacked by a non-transformed waffle iron.
- Almost all of the robot tag-alongs were completely annoying.
- Cheesy romance/break up scenes throughout the movie
- Robot balls, oompa loompa sighting, and humping robot.
- The fact that I didn't care if they saved the world or not or if the robots died or not.

3441523,3,B0019M5C0Q,"I was really disappointed in Transformers 2. It started off strong, but just got worse and worse as it went along.

The primary problem with Transformers 2 is that it seems to be geared towards pubescent boys far more than the first one was. There are simply too many ""bi***es"", ""Pu****s"" and ""A**es"" in the dialogue that just made it feel really immature. I can't help but think that the director/producers really missed the boat on this. The first Transformers was so enjoyable because it tapped back into the current-day psyche of the original fans of the toys back in the 80s. These original fans, of course, are now grown men who appreciate a movie with at least a bit of tension, believability, and emotional connection.

Transformers 2 has NONE of those great qualities from the first one. As I said before, this movie seems to be geared more towards pubescent boys. This change in target audience seems to be simply a money-grab. Pubescent boys, who are currently on summer vacation, are far more likely to make repeat viewings in the theater than the adults who grew up with them. Looking at the huge box-office haul of Transformers 2 indicates that their plan worked...but it also resulted in a movie that will not stand the test of time nearly as well as the first one has/will.

Editing is also an issue. Some of it made no sense...like when they were in the Air & Space Museum in DC, broke through one of the walls, and suddenly they're quite obviously in the aircraft Boneyard in ARIZONA (Davis Monthan Air Force Base)! Ummm...huh?? Additionally, during the final battle, they scrambled a ""predator""...showing it taking off (with turboprob engine)...and then showed it later with a jet engine!

That predator editing snafu reminds me of another issue: I think that happened because they recycled some footage material from the first movie. Some of the footage of the robots entering the atmosphere, the predator bit, and the footage onboard AWACS looked far too similar to footage from the first movie. Further evidence of footage recycling was the AWACS crew scrambled fighters to killbox ""88 Alpha Sierra"" (IIRC) in the second movie...which was the same killbox from the desert battle in first movie. Definately recycled footage. I found that really distracting and unacceptable considering the huge budget of this movie production.

The worst part of it, however, was the ""Twin"" Autobots. They were the one with the really annoying voices blurting out the silly obscenities. They really are annoying. They reminded me of JarJar Binks from Episode 1 of Starwars...because like JarJar, the movie would have been far better if they had been completely edited out or killed off quickly.

The audio and visuals of Transformers 2 were great, though. I'll probably buy it on Bluray just for use as a demonstration of the new Home Theater system...but each time I play it, I'll disappointingly think of what could have been.",1247011200,25,2933,4.915151515151515
3441524,2,B0019M5C0Q,"First off, the CGI effects are damn near perfect.  The computer artists are the only real talent that shows up on screen.  The script and dialogue sound like they were written by an 8th grader.  The film itself looks like a long music video.  Sometimes the camera will just NOT STOP MOVING.  It makes one dizzy after a while.  I guess the director and cameraman get mileage points.

Some of the sexual content is WAY too inappropriate for the younger portion of the target audience.

Shia LeBeouf looks like he's wearing a spray-on tan.

""The bigger they are, the harder they fall.""  Remember that, Megan Fox, when you are no longer the Hottie of the Moment.

This movie, like the one before it and the three Star Wars prequels, was made to show off how spiffy the effects can look and THAT'S ALL.  No intelligent or coherent script.  This film is meant to be EYE CANDY ONLY.

Kind of disappointing, too.  So much potential with the effects and budget, yet they took the ""low road"" in the Brains department.

For the record, I didn't pay to see it (nor would I).  I snuck into the screening room after leaving a showing of ""Public Enemies"".  Not a single Space Robot in ""Public Enemies"" and yet it was a far, far superior film.  Go figure.

Michael Bay movies have become their own genre:  loud, visually impressive, and dumb as a bucket of hair.  I don't think it bothers him or the studios for one nanosecond that so many people hate his films for being dumb and badly directed.  I don't think he's even trying to make a good film any more.  He specializes in Junk Food Cinema, and that's all you will likely ever get from him.

He takes advantage of moviegoers with low standards.  And he'll laugh all the way to the bank.  One of these days he's gonna make a film so bad even his devoted fans won't like it.  But by then he'll be so rich he won't care, if he's not already.  Wait!  That's it!  He's ALREADY so rich he doesn't have to care!  THAT'S why his movies stink so bad.

Believe me, the only artistically talented contributors to his films are sitting in air-conditioned offices at ILM and the other effects houses.  They produce the ""wow"" factor and Bay reaps the benefits and most of the glory.

3441527,5,B0019M5C0Q,"In 2007, the often critically maligned, yet still box office powerhouse, director Michael Bay (""Pearl Harbor"") presented us with his vision of bringing gigantic transforming robots to life on the big screen. It was big, bold, loud, funny, and above all incredibly entertaining, not to mention taking many audience members by surprise in terms of just how much fun the movie was. I mean seriously, here was a movie based on an animated series from the 80's that was itself based on a toy line from Hasbro. How could that movie be anything but absurd? Yet, somehow Bay and his writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (""Star Trek"") found a way to make it work that was believable and enjoyable to audiences, thus leading to an incredible amount of money being spent at the box office. Which brings us to the summer of 2009; two years after the initial movie blew audiences away, the inevitable sequel to the smash hit ""Transformers"" has arrived.

""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" picks up approximately two years after the events in the first film. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to head off to college sans girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) and car/guardian Bumblebee. However, Sam's higher learning shall have to wait as the evil Decepticons have returned to Earth at the behest of their overlord, The Fallen, to locate an ancient artifact of Cybertronian origin that is hidden somewhere on the planet. If the Decepticons locate the relic it would spell certain doom for humanity and the Autobots. Now, Optimus Prime and company must band together to fight their deadliest foes in an effort to ensure that Earth and its people have not seen their last days.

If you saw the original film, and judging by the box office numbers not too many people didn't, then you kind of know what may be in store for you with the sequel. Everything that worked so well in the previous movie is back, bigger and better than ever for this one. Not to diminish how great ""Transformers"" was as a movie, because it was incredible; however in my opinion, it was simply the opening act, and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is the main event.

If you presumed that this film was going to be a visual effects extravaganza with a plethora of explosions, then you would be correct; however, it isn't just a brainless exercise in blockbuster movie making courtesy of Michael Bay as some would have you believe. Written by returning screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with writer Ehren Kruger (""The Ring Two""), the story for ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is much more epic and grand in both scope and size than that of the previous film. In conjunction with all of the visually intensive action sequences, the writing team maintained the quick-witted banter of Sam, increased the presence of his romance with girlfriend Mikaela, and built upon the friendship and camaraderie between him and the Autobots. The film also has some quieter, more introspective moments, as Sam struggles with being a young adult trying to discover who he will be as a man. Meanwhile, he is also keeping secret the fact that his car is a member of an alien race hiding amongst us and that certain members of that alien race may return someday to destroy him and everything he cares about. Talk about having some internal baggage to carry with you. All of these story elements together create a movie experience that has more going for it than being just another mindless action flick.

The original film was truly an achievement in the realm of visual effects by making giant, life-like, transforming robots into a reality. With the sequel, the talented crew at Industrial Light and Magic have topped themselves yet again by delivering an even bigger smorgasbord of extremely detailed (as they were in the first one) Transformers to feast our eyes upon. Plus, because of the fact that their arrival on Earth had already been chronicled in the first film, this one allows us to see the two warring sides of this alien race much sooner, and they are much more prominent in the story as a result. I didn't know how far technology had come in the realm of CGI in the short time since the previous movie, but it appears that the capabilities these wizards now possess are leaps and bounds above what was available two years ago. For me, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" possibly sets the new standard for visual effects by which all other movies may be judged.

Returning to join the Autobots in their war against the Decepticons are the two leads in the film, Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, as Sam and Mikaela. Their two characters have matured quite a bit since the last movie, and are now trying to find their place in the outside world. Both characters are also more proactive in this film, and are working hand-in-hand with the Autobots in the effort to thwart the Decepticons' evil plans. Another aspect of their roles worth mentioning is that their relationship onscreen is very believable, and their commitment to each other in the trying times that follow is a commendable trait that is often found lacking in today's society.

Alongside Shia and Megan are supporting cast members John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, and Tyrese Gibson. All of these supporting characters are given more to do this time around. Although the characters of Lennox and Epps (Josh and Tyrese respectively) command more respect than last we saw them, it is Turturro's eccentric former Sector 7 Agent Simmons that has undergone the most change. No longer an agent of the government, Simmons has been relegated to working for his mother. I liked Turturro's performance in the original film, but his work in this one is even more enjoyable, and his eccentricity seems even better suited to his character now that he is a civilian.

Also returning for more are character actors Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents. In this movie their characters are featured a little bit more in the story, still not major players, but the time they do get on the screen they make the very best of. Both offer several moments of levity, especially Julie White, but we also get to see them go through the difficulty as a parent having to let go of a child who's growing up. Hopefully we will get to see even more from them in the inevitable third film.

Lastly, the actors giving voice to the various Transformers once again do an excellent job of bringing these characters to life. From returning talents Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving (Megatron) to newcomers Frank Welker (Soundwave), Tony Todd (The Fallen), and Tom Kenny (Skids), each member delivers a solid performance that perfectly compliments the flawless computer-generated imagery that created these robots. One last thing regarding the voice-over actors, to be truthful saying Frank Welker is a newcomer to Transformers only applies to this movie. In reality, Welker provided many of the voices in the original animated series, most notably those of Megatron and Soundwave.

Boasting an even bigger scope, more action, humor, and almost 3-times as many robots than its predecessor, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a pulse-pounding, fast-paced thrill ride that will entertain you from beginning to end.

""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1246579200,4,7311,4.874497184231697
3441528,1,B0019M5C0Q,"`Transformers 2: Revenge of The Fallen' is a marvel for two reasons: it opened to some of the most alarmingly bad critic reviews in history, as well as one of the most alarmingly successful box office grosses in history. Needless to say, the two aren't generally expected to go hand in hand. So who's right? The critics or the audiences? Well I suppose neither party can be `right' in this particular scenario, because apparently `Transformers' can be critically panned until the cows come home, and it wouldn't make a square inch of difference to the oceans of consumers flooding into theaters, eager to see the massively hyped film-or at least its skanktacular stars.

Apparently even reps for the movie itself are taking heed to the windfall of horrifyingly bad critic reviews: Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount (distributor of the film for DreamWorks), recently released a statement, claiming, ""Critics forget what the goal of the movie was/to entertain and have fun. What the audience tells us is, `We couldn't be more entertained and having more fun.' They kind of roll their eyes at the critics and say, `You have no idea what you're talking about'."" Well, the latter half of the statement couldn't be more true; I'm sure the critics and consumerist-culture audiences are indeed rolling their eyes at one another, not having the idlest idea where the other is coming from.

`Transformers 2' has moderately entertaining moments but isn't very `fun' at all; minus a handful of averagely entertaining jokes and some as-usual CGI flare, the movie is a total stinker, in every sense of the word, from start to finish. The plot is painfully contrived and out-of-nowhere, and begins just as jarringly and spastically as the film's headache-inducing editing. After some melodramatic, wannabe-epic words from Optimus, the movie opens to a random robotic brawl on the streets of somewhere, and already most audiences would walk away feeling as if they'd been bludgeoned by an enormous metal object. Sam Witwicky is heading off to college, and we're briefly treated to miniscule nuggets of hilarity thanks to his comic-relief parents, but mere minutes into the film even what they have to offer is beaten senselessly into the ground. From there, Megan Fox bends over on a motorcycle, speaks in her nauseating, Anna Nicole Smith-like drawl, has a random gratuitous wardrobe change, and whines over Sam not loving her. Meanwhile, Sam makes the convenient discovery of a fragment of the AllSpark cube on his shirt (which apparently hadn't been washed since the first movie), more random robot chaos ensues, and mom eats a pot brownie. Are we having fun yet?

`Transformers 2' is completely void of a single shred of the originality or actual fun of the `Transformers' franchise, and children who are fans of the toys should not see this movie-for multiple reasons. The film is amuck with sex jokes and toilet humor, very, very little of which most parents would find suitable for the kids who actually play with the Transformers toys. There's lots of humping, both by the Witwicky pets and by robots (yes, I'm serious), and the attempts at appealing to older audiences come in the form of rampant cussing, dolled-up pinup eye candy and morbidly unfunny sexual humor (the whole bit about Sam's mom parading her son's loss of virginity during the pot brownie scene was really, really unnecessary, and tries pathetically hard to cater to the most simple-minded of people).

And then of course there's the action. They couldn't have added more if they tried. There's robotic arms, legs, and assorted other limbs flailing about in just about every square inch of the movie, but at this point the `look what we can do' approach to CGI doesn't impress anymore. It's easy to dismiss a movie's drawbacks at least partially with the common comment of `oh, well, the special effects were pretty cool.' The special effects are absolutely all `Transformers' has to rely on at this point, what with the witless, soulless sitcom parading itself as the human characters' side story as the only available alternative. The special effects are impressive, but they don't impress, if that makes sense-in an era where CGI is the standard for movies of this type, you need more than just flashy special effects to make a decent movie, and unfortunately `T2' doesn't even manage to reach that level of decency.

`Transformers' also manages to be offensive on many levels, the most shocking of which is the introduction of Ebonics-speaking, appallingly stereotyped Mudflap and Skids, whose attempt at `comedic relief' retards comedy back to the days of blackface and racial slandering. Michael Bay was clearly very ambitious with this movie, but this big, lumbering, idiotic, overwhelming, slobbering mess it turned out to be does not properly embody the efforts of his ambition. Unless you want to be overwhelmed, dumbfounded, offended, and stupefied within the unbearably long span of 147 minutes, don't see 'Transformers 2.' Or do. Everyone else has anyway. As modern-day pop culture consumerists, we are after all programmed to naturally migrate to pop culture phenomena, regardless of how astoundingly bad or un-entertaining it may be. How else would the likes of William Hung, Octomom and Jon & Kate get their 15 minutes?",1246579200,12,5300,5.059496567505721
3441529,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the most desperate attempts I have ever seen by a movie in its desperate ideas of entertainment. Coming only two years after the release of the first Michael Bay Transformers I knew this movie was not going to be anything special, because a sequel that is pushed into completion within two years is never a good sign. Regardless, I decided to hop over to see this movie after having spent a wonderful time with Pixar's latest release, Up (more on that delightfully entertaining movie some other time).

This is the first time I shall really spoil a movie's plot points in a review, because trust me, if you are a rational human being you shall stay clear from this movie knowing its clich plot and offensive characters. If you don't want to be spoiled don't read any further, but trust me when I say, even if you enjoyed the fun popcorn film that was Transformers(2007).

The movie begins with what we find to be an alliance between the military and the Autobots from the first film as they work together in an attempt to destroy all remaining Deceptacons on the planet Earth. I suppose this was a better idea than simply repeating the exact formula of the first film, but it's just handled very childishly. This entire idea leads up to a huge, explosion filled fight with some sort of giant wheel-bot, that after a few minutes seems to be giving the Autobots the slip (of course in a Michael Bay film a giant robot destroying much of a highway is easy to cover up by the government. Durr-hurr). But what's this? A military cargo plane is flying overhead and heroic music has kicked in! Can it be? My God, it is! Here comes the toy world's most beloved robot character, Optimus Prime! Only problem is that Optimus seems to think he's in a 1980s cop film, because I wouldn't be joking if I say the first thing he tells the tinker-toy from hell after parachuting onto it was "" Pull over!"" Great! Optimus Prime has now become RoboCop! By the way, get used to one-liners like this- they make up most of the movie's dialogue.

The first problem I find in this is that the first film implied that the entire remaining robotic forces of both sides were on Earth and that there were not many others. The way this film is I believe there are THOUSANDS of Decepticons and Autobots still left in reserve and will probably be seen in some giant Lord of the Rings style battle when the third entry comes round, because as bad as this film is it will undoubtedly make a lot of money no matter how bad the word of mouth.

The military involvement is vague and they are, as is sci-fi tradition, failing to help in any way! Have you ever once seen a sci-fi/action movie where World domination seeking robots are brought down by machine gun fire? Makes you wonder what the humans are doing here in the first place! They're probably cushions for the robots whenever they fall- don't want those bright paint jobs ruined. Well, that would explain why so many of the robots in this film have red on some part of their paint job.

Cut through the opening credits and go to our loving family from the first film. These segments between Sam, his parents, Bumblebee, and Sam's mechanic girlfriend (played by more curves than brains actress Megan Fox) are something that totally turns to movie upside down whenever they occur. No longer are you watching a mindless Rock `Em Sock `Em movie, but you've gone into a sitcom I like to call ""That Robot Show."" Whether it be Sam's dogs humping each other or his mother randomly getting off on pot-brownies these segments will stoop to anything in vain attempts to make you laugh (as if the absurd action sequences aren't funny enough of a joke). The worst part about this is that there are more of these sitcom scenes than there are actual Robot-versus-Robot moments. I know this is a brainless movie but I would rather see brainless violence than laugh-less ""comic"" interludes.

Speaking of vain attempts at humor let me move right along to perhaps the worst aspect of this entire mess of a film: The Twins. Where to even begin with these unpleasant characters...Throw Jar Jar Binks into a ghetto, blend him up and split him into two and that would sum up how incredibly annoying these characters are, and if their presence wasn't enough to bother you they've made sure to provide you one of the most offensive portrayals of African Americans you will ever see in a big-budget action film. These robots...even their design screams of racist stereotype. One of them has big lips, another has big ears, and one even has a gold tooth (!!). I don't know who approved these characters or this portion of the script during development but surely no rational being could have thought these characters to be a good idea.
We also have some shameless rip-off of what appears to be The Terminator as a Deceptacon has taken to form of an attractive girl who seems to have her eyes set on Sam. You know something tells me that if I had the ability to take the form of humans I would use myself in a lot more productive manner than being a tease for college boys at Princeton (which seems to be a party university according to this film).

None of the plot really makes sense other than to come up with as many cheesy one-liners and explosions as physically possible. When the bad guys chase Sam they don't pursue, or stalk him- they just choose to blow everything up at random. There is something called tension that even a bad film can pull off, and it does not involve constant wall-to-wall explosions. Go back to the first two Terminator films. Remember how intense it was to have our human characters in a factory where a deadly machine could be anywhere? This didn't involve any explosions, or gunshots, but it sure as hell managed to create tension and edge of your seat moments.

This Transformers script came from the writing team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who earlier this Summer movie season also had their names on the incredibly entertaining Star Trek reboot. So what went wrong with them in Transformers 2? Well, Star Trek had some racial stereotypes, and silly jokes, but they never became annoying or offensive to the viewers. Why? I give credit where credit is due, and that was the talent of director J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible 3, TV's Lost). Unlike Michael Bay, Abrams knew what was worth cutting and what was worth keeping in, and the result was a movie that brought laughs, intense action, whimsical characters, visually stunning special effects, and to top it off it was edited to perfection, running just a bit over two-hours. Transformers 2 seems to have had little to no editing, running at two-hours, thirty-minutes and the director - Bay - seemed so content with what he was doing he never stopped to question what he was doing.

The result of Transformers 2 is an overly long, boring movies with very few memorable characters or action sequences...At least 300 had fun action sequences to make up for its absurd, poorly written script- same case with the first Transformers. The action sequences of Transformers 2 are miserable to watch because you can't tell what's going on unless the cheesy slow-motion moments are thrown in (and one even has a bad shot of Optimus being punched in the face and having...PURPLE ROBOT BLOOD fly from his mouth).

I'll admit to liking some movies that involve turning your brain down a notch, the first Transformers film being an example of this, but this movie just went too far. At two hours and twenty minutes I thought the first film was forty minutes too long and this sequel is only longer and much less comprehensible. Some people say these films are the exact same thing and I have to strongly disagree. In the first film you could find the characters enjoyable and sometimes even whimsical. This one everyone is a cardboard cutout. First film the special effects were enough to dazzle you. This one they are so elaborate and over developed that you often had trouble understanding what was going on! This movie is an attack on your senses, plain and simple, though it's bound to make plenty of money and a third film will undoubtedly be spawned I can only say that no one will be talking about this series five years from now. It is just a passing fancy, something pretty to look at, like the cars showcased in this movie.  Whoever kept Michael Bay in-check for the first film needs to come back.

Only good part of the film is seeing the new Corvette Stingray. Now that's a nice car, but not something [...] Luckily I snuck into this mess and paid nothing (and even then I want a refund).",1246492800,12,8625,4.604424202992843
3441530,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The original Transformers movie is an ultimate favourite of mine and I was delighted when I first heard there was going to be a sequel and Bay was going to turn up the juice. Unfortunately, in comparison to the first movie, this fell flat in many ways and left me feeling a bit empty when leaving the theatre. The amount of Transformer characters in this movie is four times as many and they have a more prominent presence on Earth in terms of their co-operation with the government in tackling the Decepticon menace.

The story is set two years after the original. More Autobots have come to Earth and formed a government alliance with the humans known as NEST which has the aim of eradicating the Decepticon presence on Earth. We see the return of our favourite Transformers and our favourite human characters such as Sam Witwicky (LaBouf), Mikaela (Fox), Major Lennox (Duhamel), Agent Simmons (Turturro) and Master Sergeant Epps (Gibson). This time the humans and Autobots face their biggest enemy to date as they have to tackle one of the original Transformers, from the Dynasty of Primes known as the Fallen.

17,000 BC the Dynasty was on Earth and the Fallen wanted to harvest the sun which would provide Energons for the AllSpark. His fellow Primes disagreed with his plan as Earth was inhabited by humans so, in order to prevent him from starting the sun harvester destroying the planet, they sacrificed themselves and hid the Matrix of Leadership which powered the harvester. The Fallen vowed to take his revenge on Earth by finding the Matrix and starting up his sun harvester and destroying the humans. Now in the present, Sam Witwicky is going to college, Soundwave has joined the Decepticon forces by hacking into a government satellite to mobilise those who will help The Fallen achieve his revenge.

On paper the plot sounds like it could work wonders and translate into one hell of a blockbuster extravaganza, however, what it translated to was a film that didn't seem to know where it was going and what it was trying to achieve. The human characters had to naturally take a step back in order to make way for the new and larger presence of the transformers, but what this meant is that the film makers still needed a reason to keep them around which ultimately, was ridiculous. The goofy humour is back but becomes way too childish for my liking. Bumblebee peeing on one of the Sector 7 agents in the first movie was pretty funny but, despite what imbeciles will tell you, dogs humping aren't. Sam's parents are also given a bigger and more annoying role as an attempt at some form of comic relief and also end up falling flat by destroying the plot line by breaking away from an important moment in the movie to see the parents being stupid.

Talking about a lesser point of the human characters, although this is to make way for the higher level Transformer storyline, it does end up meaning you don't care what happens to any character. One of the more important people in the movie does get killed and I just found myself thinking ""who cares?"" which is something you don't want in a movie. The fighting in this sequel has been altered somewhat to get away from the confusion of the fight sequences of the first film. One of the better battle sequences pits Optimus against Megatron and Starscream. The look and set up for the battle is really well done and presents an exciting scene that presents the enjoyable aspect of this film.

There's much more good and bad that I could talk about this movie, but I think it's best that you discover that for yourself. If you liked the first film then you will enjoy this but feel a bit dry coming out of it and there's the likelihood you will still prefer the first live action film. Character voicing is good, human acting is OK and the pacing and construction of the story is abysmal to say the least. When you blend them all together you are presented with a summer blockbuster that is just OK and nothing more than that. Judging by the fact that Michael seems to have learned from his mistakes of the first film, I'm hoping that if he does make this a trilogy, he manages to repair the numerous mistakes made by this one.",1246492800,,4189,4.609919571045577

experience. This film has the potential to be the best looking blu-ray yet
since the formats introduction three years ago.",1246492800,4,197,5.1875
3441532,2,B0019M5C0Q,"First of all, this is a movie based on a toy franchise marketed for kids 5 and up, so don't even start with the ""it's not intended for kids"" crap. You know kids are going to want to see this and the filemakers should have taken that into account. The level of crude humor and sexual content in this movie was completely irresponsible.

Now, knowing that kids are going to want to see it, does that mean it needs to be dumbed down? No, it does not. Look at the ORIGINAL Star Wars movies (espially SW and ESB). They appealed to both children AND adults without being dumbed down for the kids or made too mature so as to be inappropriate.

Who were they trying to appeal to in this, though? Certainly not kids, because the amount of swearing, crude humor, and sexual references (including a fairly gratuitus up-skirt shot of a coed in a slinky dress) make it inapproriate for children, yet the sophmoric idiocy of the crude humor makes it embarressing for the actual grown up. It was like watching ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with giant robots thrown in.

Some examples of the crude humor:
* Wheelie humping Mikaela's leg
* two dog humping scenes
* Devastator having testicles
* Former Agent Simmons in a thong

Some examples of the sexual content
* Sam's dorm room covered in posters of half-naked girls
* Sam being seduced multiple times by the pretender ""Alice""
* Upskirt shot of ""Alice"" and she's atop Sam in bed
* Mikaela constantly posing as if it were a Maxim photo shoot.

Plus there is an excessive amount of swearing throughout the film.
This sort of thing might be what makes a ""good"" National Lampoon movie, but it is not only unneeded, but actually brings down, a film that is supposed to be a sci-fi action movie about giant robots.

Plot-wise, there were a number of problems as well.
* Anyone who knows anything about the Transformers knows that Megatron serves only Megatron. If he is forced to serve someone else, it is reluctantly and only until he can destroy that individual. They got that right in the first. In this one, he is kissing the rear axil of the Fallen.
* Didn't Bay learn from the Phantom Menace? Jar Jar Binks characters are nearly universally despised, yet we get two, in the forms of Mudflap and Skids. They are so overwhelmingly annoying that I spent the entire time they were on screen waiting for them to get killed. (I could care less if they were racial steriotypes. So was Jazz from the first. Jazz, however, was cool. These two were obnoxious. And they killed off Jazz but neither of these -go figure.)
* The cool Autobots got very little screen time.
* There was a massive lack on continuity between the first and second movie as well.

These plot problems I could live with, but the crassness I cannot, which is truly disappointing to me because the movie DID get somethings right. The action sequences were great. I loved the team effort between the soldiers and the Autobots in taking down the Decepticons. I loved that there were more Transformers overall as well. I also liked the dead on depiction of our current administration. After the World ""Apology"" tour, I can easily see Obama blaming the Autobots for the destruction the Decepticons caused and asking them to leave (while turning Sam over to Megatron and the Fallen).",1246492800,21,3268,4.595197255574614
3441533,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I just saw this last night. I am a fan of the first one; it may not have had the deepest plot and story-line but there was some substance to go along with the fun special effects laden action.

I was very excited for the second movie - I'm 25, Transformers was a part of my childhood.

Once again Micheal Bay ruins what could have been a good movie by relying on big explosions and effects to mask a dreadfully boring plot and story. The entire time I kept thinking ""Well what is the significance of this part? Well who is this robot? WHY are they fighting? HOW does this scene relate to anything? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!?"" I'm talking about even within the opening scenes. And the swearing? Out of place! The Jar Jar Binks-esque comedy relief just added another layer of disappointment.

Loved the first one... but my god this movie flat out sucks. I didn't believe the negative reviews on here and went to see this garbage anyway when I could have saved my time and money. Don't bother with this one. Get the first on Blu-Ray and avoid this kick to the brain. If you have any taste you'll wait for it to hit DVD to rent.

Anyway, this movie was action packed from beginning to end. Shia is an AMAZING actor, and Megan Fox is...well...HOT! This movie is ten times better than the first film due to: More variety of Autobots as well as Decepticons, more dialogue from both factions(Megatron and Starscream especially), and just the visual effects were astonishing. Slow motion fighting and more visual fighting scenes rather than the blurry dark fighting scenes in the first movie. in conclusion this is an AWESOME movie and should be seen by everyone possible!",1246320000,4,707,4.9

This movie deserves the thumbs up, however, there were some scene transitions that weren't smooth, I'd leave that to your opinion when you see it. Also, the deceptacons got alot more air time that the autobots. There were some ""over the head"" one liners that were very funny. Generally, it was a very entertaining movie, it was witty, and the sound/special effects were awsome!!!",1246233600,2,465,4.825

Most of the movies I see are with my son and while that tends to preclude excellent movies (though I have loved Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up) this was still enjoyable. I don't think it is as good as the first one (which was a positive surprise for me) but it was good enough.

People who expect more than slightly juvenile entertainment from a movie like this are not getting it. I just compare it to the last move I took junior to (Land of the Lost) and it suddenly looks like a masterpiece.",1246233600,2,759,4.053333333333334
3441537,1,B0019M5C0Q,"I wasn't expecting much going into this film. I'm aware of director Michael Bay's history and his habit of making mindless popcorn films with huge explosions, scantily-clad women, and awful cheesy dialogue. Sometimes that's okay for me. However, I thought the first film was okay for what it was, so figured maybe I would like the sequel. I was wrong. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is the most ridiculous campy, poorly-written and poorly-directed film to come out this year. The acting by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox is average, and the special effects are extremely well done. That's about the only saving grace for this film.

The writing is so unbelievable you almost have to see it to believe it. At one point a character actually utters the line ""not on my watch."" No one in the history of the military has ever said this outside of a film. Reading over the screenplay, you would think it was some terrible Transformers fan faction written by a tenth grader and posted to the Internet. The dialogue is horrible. This would be a great movie if it was targeted to 9 year olds, but the overt sexual references and language suggest an older demographic. Maybe it's because Bay is trying to please a wide range of people, and maybe that's why we have jokes made about Transformer Testicles and there's a scene where a transformer (with a Jersey accent much less) tries to hump Megan Fox's leg. What possible reason is this robot trying to hump her leg? Is that the way they procreate? There is ZERO excuse for it other than a cheap laugh. And that's ALL the jokes are, cheap laughs. I honestly would not have been surprised to see a transformer fart in this film, or maybe a scene where a transformer gets high. It wouldn't matter if it made sense because an intoxicated transformer would be HILARIOUS. But don't worry, because there's plenty of scenes of Sam's mother accidentally getting high at college and proceeding to follow the Robin Williams/Jim Carey acting formula of physical humor. Then there are Skids and Mudflap - two Autobots who can't read, speak in ""jive,"" act like gangster-wannabes, and fight a lot. One of them even has a gold tooth (I am not making that up). I am one of the last people you will meet who cares about things being politically correct or will ever claim anything is racist unless it is blatant, but this was a BLATANT stereotype. I cannot believe this made it into the movie. I wouldn't call it racist, but if these characters had actually been human, the NAACP would have freaked out.

This movie is also insanely long, at a running time of 2.5 hours. This probably could have been avoided if there wasn't so much slow motion footage of people running. I was miserable after the first 45 minutes. Bay should have cut at a minimum, the last half hour off of the movie. The action scenes, while good, were way too confusing. The robots are so complex you can't tell what is happening since it's so fast and you can't figure out

Transformers: ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is not Armageddon. It is not Bad Boys. It is definitely not the Rock. Say what you will about those films, they at least had somewhat decent plots and required some brain activity. This movie is nothing but pure mindless action, awful jokes, and gratuitous shots of Megan Fox (and only one of those is a good thing).",1246233600,,3312,4.610169491525424
3441538,3,B0019M5C0Q,"I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. His MTVish, everything looks like a commercial, hyperactive directing style caters to the lowest-common denominator of film-making. Everything he has ever done has been so over-the-top and ridiculous, I personally think it's embarassing that his movies make as much money as they do. He insults our intelligence by removing creativity and replacing it with mind-numbing, ""what the heck just happened"", ""that was ridiculous"" explosions.

That being said, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS (the first one). It seemed to me that Michael Bay had finally found a movie where he could be his arrogant over-the-top self and nobody would notice. I mean, how more over-the-top can you get than robots that transform into cars, boats, planes and whatever else they feel like.

Yet, TRANSFORMERS 2: RISE OF THE FALLEN showed Bay's over-the-topness in a different way. The least of which is the ability to shoot some of the most unnecessarily sexist shots of Megan Fox I've ever seen in a movie. The first time we see Mikaela Banes (Fox), she's leaning forward on her motorcycle in her short short shorts for everybody to drool over. Look, I appreciate the beauty that is Megan Fox just like the next guy. She's smokin' hot, but that camera shot is hands down, the most unnecessary camera shot in the history of film. Sure, for a sex movie or Basic Instict or such, but not TRANSFORMERS, a movie that is based off of a popular set of toys, cartoons and is catered toward young people.

On top of that, we have to witness the unnecessary hanging testicles of one robot and countless other unnecessary instances.

Then of course there's the action sequences that are so fast and confusing it had me thinking of SPEED RACER and how the creators needed to just tone it down a notch. Wrestling matches between robots become just a pile of twisted metal. Just F/X rolling around on screen.

The entire final sequence was so rapidly edited and over here, over there, over here again, over there, here's a new place, who's that, what side is that robot on? who just got blown up? oh, there's some giant robot testies, explosion here, explosion there, run there, run here... and it's over.

I had actually started to find a small place of appreciation for Michael Bay after the first Transformers movie, but now he's right back in the cellar with me. Too bad though. This isn't a bad movie. There are a lot of funny, entertaining, well-constructed moments in RISE OF THE FALLEN, it was just a movie that was poorly handled by an arrogant director who thought he had to do way too much stuff.

I wanted to give it 2 stars, but there is enough entertainment to make it a worthy watch. It just could have been so much more if Michael Bay had an ounce of tact in his repertoire.

Less is more Bay. Less is more.",1246233600,4,2805,4.663967611336032
3441539,4,B0019M5C0Q,"This movie cannot be compared to the first one.  The first Tranformers movie dealt with the robots being discovered for the first time.  That can't be re-created for the sequel.  One had to know going in that this movie would be pretty much good robots vs. bad robots.  And that's exactly what it was.

Yes, the movie is flawed here and there.  There may be a few too many Michael Bay-esque shots...you know, slow-mo explosions, a quick shot of a plane flying with the sound of radio traffic, pilots jogging (in slow motion) towards their planes, etc.  There's not a very solid plot; it's good robots vs. bad robots.  Some of the dialogue is silly.  And there are a few less than believable scenes.

But so what?  This is a fun, loud, exciting movie.  A perfect turn off your brain summer flick.  The special effects are very good.  There are some very cool scenes involving the robots, and the Decepticons steal the show with some new additions and one huge robot made up of many others.

I didn't feel that the movie was too long.  It didn't seem like 2 and a half hours.  I suppose the nearly constant action helped with that.  My 6-year old son and I watched it and both enjoyed it a lot.  He told me he didn't want it to end (and I suppose it won't with more sequels to come for sure).

I'm not one to bash other reviewers (although I think there are A LOT of Michael Bay haters in the movie critic population).  But a few of the comments I saw in reviews here make me shake my head.  One of the repeated complaints was the language and some of the adult humor.  Without going on a tirade here, I just wanted to point out that this movie is rated PG-13.  A PG-13 movie is not a family movie.  Some scenes may not be suitable for those under the age of 13.  I'll leave it at that.

Overall, Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen is not better than the original.  It's different.  It's an action movie, and a pretty good one with cool action scenes, great special effects, exciting new robots, and a lot of humor.  Turn off your brain, sit back, and enjoy.

Some of which are justifiable (twin Autobots Mudflap and Skids being caricatures of racial stereotypes for one, and the fact that there isn't much of a story to be found here), but in the end, Revenge of the Fallen is just as its predecessor was: big, dumb, and loud fun.  The story picks up two years after the conclusion of the last film, with the heroic Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the great Peter Cullen) and his Autobots allied with the military and taking out renegade Decepticons across the globe.  In the meantime, Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is embarking on going away to college, much to the chagrin of his obscenely hot girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox).  Things don't go too well for Sam however, as it turns out he holds the key to the Decepticons plans for universal domination, as Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is revived, and his ancient, evil master The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd) unleashes a wave of destruction upon the planet.  Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and the great John Turturro are back as well; even though most of them take a back seat to the display of giant robots smashing and destroying everything in sight.  Despite the many inherent flaws of Bay's filmmaking, he does manage to coax enough comedic moments out of the proceedings, and there is great interplay between LaBeouf and Fox, plus (of course) enough brilliant special effects to keep you glued to the screen.  The only real major drawbacks of the film is that at a solid two and a half hours, it does wear out its welcome, and the film as a whole just isn't as awe inspiring as its predecessor, as the audience is now used to seeing these giant robots in disguise transform and cause mass destruction.  If you enjoyed the first Transformers film, you'll probably enjoy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, just based on the fact that, as previously mentioned, it is big, dumb, and loud fun that proves to be enjoyable; even when there is so much happening on the screen that you may get lost in the haze.

But, great special effects hardly compensate for mediocre action sequences and inept storytelling.  This mega-budget clunker has too many moronic nuts and bolts to ever be considered much of a smooth thrill ride.

I did like this slightly more than the original, but that's not saying much.  The plot here is pretty stagnant and unimaginative, but I wasn't expecting anything close to THE DARK KNIGHT.  But for some reason this weak story gets stretched to 2.5 hours, and it gets extremely tedious.

There are some decent fight scenes, and the Decepticons do seem pretty formidable.  Partially this film seemed geared towards a family film, as there are no human casualties in battle.  But then for some reason they threw in plenty of unneccessary profanity just for some cheap laughs.  And some drug use?  Hardly meant for the younger crowd.
Plus some other attempts at humor fall pretty flat.

Another Big problem:
Shia Lebouf--the dork
Megan Fox--the goddess
Bumblebee--the awesomest car/robot ever created
The result--Lebarf leaves them for college and makes out with the first chick he meets?  Plus Megan catches him and quickly forgives him?

3441553,1,B0019M5C0Q,"Revenge of the Fallen is a horrible movie. It's much worse than the first and is an absolute failure in almost every possible way. Here are a few:

1) CRITICAL NARRATIVE CONTINUITY FAILURE

This movie does not have a ""plot"" per se. Instead, it has numerous chunks of plots that have sort of been smooshed together, and although each one makes internal sense, they add up to gibberish. For example, what happened to the Decepticons who revived Megatron (other than Ravage)? How did Sam's parents get from France to Egypt, and why? Why does Sam suddenly stop seeing those symbols? Where'd that blue guy (Bolt or Jolt or whatever its name is) come from, and what happened to it? It was on screen for about 2 seconds out of the whole movie. What's worse is that many of these plot chunks are not even consistent with the original movie, much less each other. Seriously. In the first movie, the leader of the Decepticons was Megatron, who started the war because of a dispute over how to use the Cube's abilities. In the second movie, the leader of the Decepticons is The Fallen, who started the war because of a dispute over star-destruction regulations. I still don't remember whether or not explanations were given for why a key was created for The Fallen's doomsday device, why The Fallen returned to Cybertron, blah blah blah...

2) CRITICAL CHARACTERIZATION FAILURE

My mind is still trying to come to grips with the fact that the three most annoying, useless characters in the movie - let's call them Hump-Bot, Beavis, and Butt-head - got such huge amounts of dialog and screen time, whereas characters that might have actually been cool, like Ratchet, Ironhide, Arcee, and the silver car with the swords for arms, got virtually none and were completely wasted. Other beloved characters from the old cartoon that had great potential, like Hound and Mirage, were left out of the movie entirely (AGAIN!) to make room for the useless idiot characters. On the Decepticon side of things, I guess it's kind of cool that Soundwave showed up, even if he didn't actually do anything except talk in space (which makes no sense for numerous scientific and narrative reasons that I won't go into). Devastator shows up, but at no point in the movie is the word ""Constructicon"" mentioned, nor are the names of the Constructicons mentioned, nor do the Constructicons even have individual robot forms or identities as far as I can tell. To make up for it, there are numerous other Decepticons that also transform into construction equipment, but aren't Constructicons, and do have individual robot modes, but not names. The biggest insult, however, was Skyfire. The very best episode in the original cartoon was all about Skyfire and his difficult choice between his friendship with Starscream and his sense of moral right and wrong. He had the greatest potential to be an awesome, complex, well-developed character with an interesting storyline. In this movie, however, he has been reduced to an old geezer yelling ""get off my lawn, dagnabbit kids and their rock and roll music... back in my day... fifteen miles through the snow... prune juice... broke my hip back in World War 2, ya know..."" until he finally kills himself because he can't stand how much he sucks compared to his cartoon version. Then, instead of having an ""alas poor yorick, I knew him well"" moment, Optimus is like ""hey thanks yo, I could use the parts"" and goes SUPER SAIYAN FOR TEH WIN.

3) CRITICAL MATURITY FAILURE

Okay, I'll admit that a guy accidentally tasing himself in the nuts is kinda funny, and if you're 9 years old, watching Mojo hump another dog might be funny too. But a robot humps Mikaela's leg? Devastator has testicles? Dear God... it's like ""Bumblebee pisses on John Turturro"" times ten. And I did NOT need to see John Turturro's hairy arse in a G-string! Seriously, I'm not making this up.

4) CRITICAL ABILITY-TO-SEE-WHAT-THE-HECK-IS-GOING-ON FAILURE

The first movie suffered heavily from this as well.

5) CRITICAL NARRATIVE CONTINUITY FAILURE

Okay, so, like... couldn't the Fallen have just built a second sun-killing device? One that didn't require a key? How can the Cube hold all Cybertronian knowledge if it predates their civilization? How did the Cube go from ""put it in a robot's chest and it kills them"" to ""put it in a robot's chest and it revives them""? WHY HOW WHY HOW?!?

With that having been said, I confess that I did enjoy myself quite a lot during this movie. Sam's parents were excellent, as were the scenes with Megatron and Starscream. I also loved the fact that they brought back Frank welker for the voice of Soundwave, even if he's doing his Dr. Claw voice from Inspector Gadget instead of his Soundwave voice. Overall, though, the vague semblance of a plot sucks, most of the characters suck, much of the humor sucks, basically everything in this movie sucks.",1246147200,43,4869,4.8261390887290165

3441555,5,B0019M5C0Q,"The Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen blu-ray is nothing short of spectacular. The picture and sound are top notch. I was one of those kids who grew up watching Transformers and playing with all the cool transformer toys. I was thrilled when the first live Transformers movie came out a few years back. I was just as excited to see the new Transformers Revenge of The Fallen movie, but was a little worried after reading some pretty bad reviews. I don't know whats up with all the haters and critics who hate this movie. Oh well, all that matters is that I enjoyed it, and many Transformers fans will enjoy it as well. After seeing the new Transformers movie I can say the critics are wrong, this movie was awesome! The entire original cast is back which plays a huge part of this movies success. The movie takes off where the last one left off. Starscream (now the leader of the Decepticons) decides to return to earth from Cybertron to revive the Decepticon leader Megatron. After the Autobots discover Megatron has been revived and is now seeking revenge, Optimus Prime tries to get Sam to help them stop Megatron once and for all. This new movie is even more action packed than the first, and if you're a fan of Transformers you will most likely love this new movie. This is now one of the best looking blu-rays to date. The Walmart edition is similar to the IMAX Dark Knight edition, with a few fight scenes that fill up your entire TV, but other than that there's not much difference. There is no doubt that this will be the one of if not the biggest selling blu-ray to date. With the new PS3 slim and top notch release like this, I believe this is the movie to finally take blu-ray to the mainstream.

As an added bonus, the Blu-ray will include an exclusive interactive feature that gives viewers the ability to customize their own robot characters and get a glimpse at a rogue robot. Out of all the available permutations, one will unlock an exclusive interview with Michael Bay about his plans for the next adventure.

3441556,3,B0019M5C0Q,"It was okay. First off, the camera angles were very bad. Most of the time you couldn't even see the transformations. You can just see a car in one shot and then a robot in the next. They should have zoomed out more so that you can actually SEE the transformation scenes. I have the same complaint for the fight scenes. The camera zoomed in so close to the robots that you could barely see any of the fights.

As far as the story line went, it was very formulaic. The evil leader who was dispatched centuries ago came back for revenge, as if that hasn't happened a hundred movies. Then of course they kill of Optimus, but did ANYONE really think he wouldn't make a come back some how.  Finally, the whole thing about the Egyption pyramids being built by evil robots...how many times has THAT been done? In AVP the Egyption pyramids were built by Predators to house their hunt of the Aliens for sport. In every single movie, the Egyption pyramids were built by some other alien creature hundreds of years ago.

The story was definitely just a group of expected and predictable story elements that you sit there and go, ""how many movies in history have done that?""

They did a good job at giving human characteristics to alien robots, and they did have some funny personalities, but the humor just did not save this film. I expected more.

Over all, the special effects (what you got to see of them) were not bad, but the story just felt like recycled Hollywood cliches.",1246147200,2,1467,4.479400749063671
3441557,1,B0019M5C0Q,"The first Transformers movie was great!  And the second?

Bigger, longer, louder, more robots, more action, more Megan Fox, more CGI ... so how can you end up with a worse movie than the original?

Well, it happened, as Michael Bay definitely went out of control here.  What are the problems with this movie?

Characters - When John Turturro returns and actually becomes one of the more sympathetic characters in the movie, that tells you just how packed the script is with truly annoying characters.  Ramon Rodriguez led the list for Character-Who-I-Most-Wanted-to-See-Gutted-By-Megatron.  Isabel Lucas, the supposed Aussie hottie and rival to Megan Fox, was OMG some wierd orange shade of tan... NOT attractive,  gross, really.  Skids and Mudflap... WTF?  Oh yeah, for sure there were strong racist overtones here in their jive-talking and monkey-ghetto appearance, but what was worse was that they were just sooooo Jar-Jar Binks acid-on-the-nerves annoying.

The list of characters in the ""Needs To Be Killed by Megatron Real Soon"" category is just too long for this movie to be enjoyable.

Robots, you want more giant robots?  Way too many giant robots - couldn't hardly tell who was who in all the fighting, couldn't even see what all the fighting moves were... lots of robot deathblows, the CGI was great, but the images were so densely packed with detail that they blurred in the mind - way, way Too Much Information!!!  Can we get subtitles for the action sequences on the DVD/Blu-Ray?

More TMI - was it me, or did the dialogue sound compressed and speeded up?  Several times, it sounded like Sam and Mikaela were talking to each other at Fedex speeds - no they didn't sound like chipmunks, but it is possible  to speed up the soundtrack and lower the tonal frequencies to normal.  Maybe this was the only way Michael Bay could get the movie to come in at only 2-1/2 hours instead of four hours.

Plot... well, seriously, after all the critics decrying the lack of any plot in this movie, I came away thinking that this problem with the movie was way overblown compared to all of its other problems.  I don't know about you, but I didn't come into this movie expecting any plot.  This is after all a movie about giant robots fighting each other.

But somehow or another, in the first movie, we were made to care more about these robots, and about the humans they were fighting over.  That was what made the first Transformers so enjoyable.  All of that went out the window in this movie.  As you sit through this very long second movie in the Transformers franchise, you begin to wish that Megatron could hurry up and gut everybody in the movie....

...Except for Megan Fox of course.  Fox manages to appear even more lovely in this film than the first, the only thing improved from the first movie...

Overall, though, by piling in an excess of almost everything except sympathetic characters into this movie, Michael Bay has made this movie into an example of information overload, and it becomes just a tedious exercise for the eyes.",1246147200,54,3045,4.781609195402299
3441558,2,B0019M5C0Q,"First, let me say that I enjoyed the first film.  It was nothing great and it will be forgotten by anyone who is a real film fan in less then five years, but it was fun and some of the visuals were genuinely exciting and unique.  I don't care about the original cartoon show.  I thought it was boring and lame when I was six and in my older age it's down right intolerable and obviously an ingenious extended commercial for a toy line.  That's it.  The mythology, characters and plots aren't worth talking about or remembering.  I was thankful that the first film only retained the only cool element of the concept which was cars and machines instantly transforming into giant robots, no matter how illogical.  That's it!

While the first film kept the first act down and simple with suburban comedy, high school loser hijinks and military conflict seemingly based in some reality with the fantastic element of giant robots, the sequel just piles on loud, ugly and confusing imagery and action with lame and foreced jokes.  I enjoyed the humorous elements of the first film.  It helped take some of the edge off the story which is totally stupid to begin with.  Taking it too serious would have made the film more funny then I think the creators would've intended.  There is nothing memorable about this film.  The plot is not only uninteresting, it never really makes sense and it's not even an inch compelling.  Sure, this film has some moments that are entertaining, but they are mild and one of them involves a small robot humping Megan Foxx's leg!  That's it.  So, that tells you the heights this film strives for.

Special effects, the real reason anyone would even mildy care about this film.  Are they good?  I guess so.  They are basically the same as the first, but there's more of them.  Great.  The spectacle of the first film's robots is gone, gone two years ago.  This film doesn't offer anything new regarding visuals.  We get some new robots of course, but their designs aren't fun or interesting.  Plus, we get robots with personalities in more abundance this time, but again I say that mildly.  A pair of twins speak fluent 'hip-hop'.  Right.  Of course an ancient species of robot new to earth would talk like the type of idiots you see hanging out at the food court in the mall.  How innovative.  Oh, and the 'leg humping' robot talks like he's straight out of Brooklyn, of course.  I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, John Tuturro provides its voice and it sounds similar to the one he did for the film Monkeybone.  Oh, and one is British, he's old and wise, so of course he's British!  This is pure mind rot and it's unfortunate that this British robot is the only CGI character of any interest.

Now onto the humans.  Ummm...wait, there are no humans in this film!  Not one recognizable human trait to be found among the many human denizens in this film, AND the humans are more interesting in this film then the robots!  Megan Fox should've got billing along with her endless supply of glycerine(filmmakers use it to make actors look sweaty in movies).  Bay is in love with the mere image of Fox, and why not, she's completely hot, but it is so escessive and gratuitous I was embarrassed to be watching it.  Her opening shot would make a great still photo in Maxim but in a film where she is supposed to be a real person it's really stupid!  Lebouf is a real pro with the comic beats.  Hew fumbles and reacts in fun and real ways, but his character's arch involves him not being able to tell his two year long girlfriend that he loves her and it is really straight out of a sitcom and holds no dramatic interest or weight.  It's lame and cheap.  Oh, and then there's  the parents.  They were a funny part of the original film so I guess Bay decided that it worked so well that he would over-do it this time.  Again, no real humanity just sitcom hijinks.  Why is there a scene in this film involving the mom losing her mind after eating a pot brownie at her son's new college campus?  It's lame and tired and totally besides the point.  Even moreso when the main plot has nothing to do with the college experience, unlike in the first film where the idea of your first car and big spectacle in suburbia was used as a great juxtaposition.  Hell, at least the parents were memorable if not believable in this film.

John Tuturro comes back from the original and manages to deliver his awful dialogue with some tact, but again, nothing remotely human in this character.  In the last film he was sort of exposition/comic relief but here he is a main player and unfortunately the way the character is composed you realize how little interest he really holds.  Good thing they got a really talented and pro actor for this, or would've been unbearable.

Excessive is the best way to describe this sequel, and you expect a sequel to give more of the same but bigger, but this film just repeatedly bashes you over the head and it becomes numbing and worse, unpleasant.  Why would someone think constant loud noises and explosions and robots punching each other for two and half hours is entertaining?  Aren't action films supposed to have a flow, a build of momentum?  It's just constant in-your face action with no purpose and no drama, and action that doesn't involve characters you care about, especially the robots for which the film is titlted after.  In big dumb summer films I need either two things, or both if I'm lucky: interesting characters or an intriguing plot.  This film has neither.  If you want to experience what this film has do this; punch you self in the face, sit under a giant ringing bell while listening to a recording of someone screaming.

There are some good moments in the film, very few.  The battle that leads to Optimus Prime's 'death' is fun and what I paid to see.  The same goes for the opening action scene.  Once they pass I thought the film would start going to new places but rather settled to do those two scenes in different locations over, and over, and over, and over, and over again for almost three hours!  Why is this film two and half hours long?  Why?  At an hour and half at least it would've been mildly diverting and a fairly pleasureable experience at the movies.

Michael Bay is not a brilliant director.  He is a brilliant still-photoagrapher, brilliant 2nd unit action director, brilliant special visual and practical effects supervisor, and a good cinematographer.  In these jobs he would be a great asset to any more talented director.  I'm no hater of Bay either.  His film The Rock was very good, though a lot of credit must go to Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris for that one, and I thought he was improving at telling stories with the last Transformers and The Island.  Both films were fun and well told and had some spectacular sequences worth remembering, but with Transformers: Rise of the Fallen he seems to be regressing back to Bad Boys II territory, and that was one of the most overly-long, mind numbing, boring, excessive, totally awful films I ever saw.  Maybe it should be a rule that Bay can't do anymore sequels to his own films.

I still have faith in the movie going public.  I know this film will do really well in the first two weeks or so, but I don't think it will do as well as the first film and I hope return receipts drop after the first few weeks.  I'm not sure I want to meet a person who claims they like movies and thought this film was good or entertaining on any level.  How mind numb, stupid and dull does one have to be to like this film?  I know I'm being harsh, but when you have morons on this site claiming that people are too hard on films like this and Wolverine and us harsh critics go into these films wanting hate them, really are the low bar setters that are ruining films.  I don't pay hard earned money hoping a movie will suck so I can get-off complaining on the internet!  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard!  I had no expectations for this film beyond just being entertained for a few hours.  It wasn't entertaining to me and that's it.  Maybe those who say these things should raise thier expectations or maybe see real summer films like the original Star Wars, Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Missions: Impossible, new Bond films, Aliens, The Dark Knight or any of the various Pixar films.  I'm happy for you if you like this film, but at the same time you really scare and worry me.  Also, maybe you folks can tell me why alien robots with massive and super-hi-tech technology wuld fight each other using their fists or arm daggers?  What a waste of time!  Don't they have lazer guns or something?  Why, oh why, after countless rounds from the last film and in this film, would the military continue to shoot bullets at these alien robots?  It's obvious they have little to no effect on them!  AAAAGGGHHH!!!

PS: This awful new Transformers film has gotten much valid critcisms but there is one that I don't agree with--some claim that the hip-hop personalities of the twin robots is racist against black people.  NO.  The robots are pink and green, not black.  In my life I've seen many white, Asian and even Indian folks with hip-hip slang, gold teeth and big ears.  Go to the mall, go to L.A. or go to New York City, and you'll see what I mean.  If you see racism or black stereotypes then you might be the racist.  Just a thought.",1246060800,7,9377,4.491124260355029

3441560,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The first Transformers, while far from great, was one of Michael Bay's best films. I know that's not saying much, but it had unique SFX that should have won the Oscar and a sense of fun throughout. Revenge of the Fallen has even better visuals and a whole lot more action, but the dialogue and script are really weak this time around. There are a bunch of scenes that try way too hard to be funny and the addition of two ""black"" sounding robots who claim they can't read, brings back horrible memories of Jar Jar Binks. Shia Labeouf is okay in the first half of the movie, but he is given little to do or say after that.

There are a couple of things that left me no choice other than giving it three stars. The SFX are outstanding and you can see more of what is happening in the fights. Megan Fox is not even close to being a good actress, but she is really something to look at. Michael Bay loves showing her off, especially her gorgeous face. The other hot girl (Isabel Lucas) tries to seduce Shia's character in college and she is near perfect in the looks department as well.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a long movie and it feels that way, but I was entertained enough to say it is worth seeing in theaters if you liked the first movie.",1246060800,2,1254,4.264705882352941

the decepticons searching for the all-spark,and in TRANSFORMERS:
REVENGE OF THE FALLEN,the decepticons are searching for
what remains of the all-spark and of course Megatron's

3441563,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is an aggressive, incomprehensible film that has no ambition other than to assault the senses with blinding special effects and a hell of a lot of noise. There's not a moment of entertainment to be found in any of its self-indulgent 150 minutes ... unless, of course, you find mindless action sequences and inconsequential plots entertaining. It follows the tradition of its equally God-awful predecessor by bombarding us with tangled images of destruction before pausing to be funny, although I use the term loosely since I never laughed, although I did smirk once at an outburst from one of the Transformer robots. I won't spoil it for you, seeing as there would no other reason to go see this film once you know what it is.

The plot: Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is ready to go to college. Before he leaves, he discovers a broken piece of the cube from the first film, the one that can turn any inanimate object into a Transformer. Instantly, his mind is filled with bizarre symbols that somehow relate to the ongoing war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Once he's in school, he occasionally has severe mental overloads, causing him to talk incoherently and write out all the symbols in his head. With the help of his techno-geek roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Sam tracks down the flustered Agent Simmons (John Turturro), who now works behind the counter of his mother's deli. Simmons has reason to believe that the Transformers have been among us for thousands of years.

The Autobots, meanwhile, have since allied themselves with Earth armies to track down and destroy any Decepticons that have been in hiding. But it's a very shaky alliance, especially now that Decepticons are arriving from outer space and destroying major cities all over the world. A highly distrustful government official named Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey) seems to believe that they're only after the Autobots, not only because the remaining shard of the cube is under heavy lock and key, but also because the evil Megatron is slowly decaying at the bottom of the ocean. The leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), knows that Galloway is wrong and turns to Sam for help.

Up in space, there awaits the malevolent Decepticon known only as The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd), who, as the title suggests, wants revenge against Earth and the Autobots. Why? Who cares? Let's just leave it at this: If he didn't want revenge, there wouldn't be a movie.

Back to Sam and his pals. They end up in the Egyptian desert for one reason or another and make a remarkable discovery in one of the three Pyramids. This, in turn, leads to the climactic battle between the Decepticons, Optimus Prime, and the American military. Funny how the Egyptian military (or any random Egyptian, for that matter) fails to notice that the Pyramids are being blown and smashed to smithereens. No matter; we're only supposed to pay attention to the action, and boy, is there a lot of it. I will say that I kind of liked the Transformer that used its mouth as a gigantic vacuum cleaner, sucking up sand as if it lived off of the stuff. Naturally, its throat is nothing more than a series of metal gears meant to grind whatever it sucks up into fine fragments.

But wait--I haven't even gotten to the ""funny"" parts yet. In the course of this movie, we see a mini Transformer ravishing Mikaela's leg like a dog, Sam's beloved Bumblebee Camero SS crying at the thought of being abandoned, and Sam's mother (Julie White) accidentally eating a marijuana-laced brownie, after which she acts like a reject from a vaudeville slapstick routine. As if this weren't bad enough, two Transformers in particular cross the fine line between satire and insensitivity; disguised as a pair of compact hatchbacks, twins Skids and Mudflap (voiced by Tom Kenny and Reno Wilson) constantly argue with each other using slang-heavy ghetto street talk. The filmmakers take the stereotype one step further by giving one of them a gold tooth. This isn't funny. It's not even mildly amusing. It wouldn't be appropriate in any movie, let alone the sequel to ""Transformers.""

I enjoy escapist entertainment as much as the next person. But my God, something went horribly wrong when Michael Bay decided to make two films based on action figures. ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is such a miserable experience, so loud, so visually unappealing, so terrible at finding a balance between action and humor. The story is jam-packed, but not with anything of interest or value. Absolutely nothing about the plot sinks in; it's a two and a half-hour exercise in storytelling without actually telling a story. The next time I want that kind of experience, I'll read a book with the TV on while playing a CD of exploding sound effects on my stereo system. I'll make sure to turn the subwoofer all the way up, because goodness knows feeling the sounds is just as important as hearing them.",1246060800,5,5039,4.860302677532014
3441564,2,B0019M5C0Q,"The only reason I give this movie two stars is for the special effects, they were great. Other than that, this movie was a regurgitation of Joseph Campbell's hero theme which seems to be the pulse of Hollywood cinema nowadays.

In the begining of the movie, there were two robots who occupies a dirty rusted out ice cream shouting obnoxious idiocy(EBONICS) form their speakers. Early in the film these characters are provided with with two vehicles to function with and join the Autobot fight against the Decepticons. When these ""HOOD RICH"" robots are outfitted, they just so happen to give them gold teeth. There is a scene where the main character needs to translate old Autobot language and these two robots look at each other and say ""WE DON'T READ MUCH"" admitting that they were unable to read their own language. The only thing they knew was that the language was ""OLD SCHOOL."" This is no different than Handcock being a homeless alcoholic talked into going to jail with superpowers. This is ridiculous!

The other thing I had a hard time with was the Hispanic charecter in the movie. He started out looking for the Transformers on earth through the internet. Once he came into direct contact with the very thing he was looking for, he became a scared whimpering coward that lasted the rest of the movie. The only hero in this movie was the lead character, it was amazing how his destiny transcended earth and lined up with an alien species.

In summary, this movie was not made for men and women of color. This movie was made for men and women of the Caucasian race. It's real unfortunate that this type of negative imagery of Latino and Blacks still takes place on the big screen in plain sight. There are many that will read this and say that I'm just over reacting, watch this movie through the eyes of men and women of color and I can guarantee you will agree with that is written in this review. Hollywood has done it again, see it for yourself and prove me wrong!",1245974400,3,1976,4.576271186440678
3441565,3,B0019M5C0Q,"I can't believe I'm about to write this, but the Transformers sequel isn't as bad as the critics say. It really isn't. Especially if you are a person who never really got into the original animation series. Such a person might be dazzled by the sheer spectacle of 3D cars and planes turning into massive robots. A person unburdened by the history of the Transformers brand would probably care less that virtually all of the characters are so radically redesigned, both in appearance and personality, that they bear little to no semblance to the source materal. That won't matter to them.

But it matters to me. As a kid I was loyal to the original series. I knew all the charcters. I knew their strengths and weaknesses. Their designs were simple and easy to recognize. Even their voices were so singular that I knew who was who without seeing them. But I am not the intended audience. Accepting that made it possible to appreciate some parts of the movie.

Michael Bay did not set out to make a Transformers movie. He set out to make an action movie that merely uses the Transformers brand. With such an agenda, he's not obligated to evoke nostalgia by keeping the designs even remotely true to the source material. In fact, with the exception of Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee, the remaining autobots are so much new inventions that I can only wonder why Bay decided to stick with their original names. The Deceptions seemed more inspired by James Cameron's Aliens than by the original characters. They are also so generic in appearance and complicated in detail that they are pretty much anonymous. Especally in battle. When a deception is killed, it's difficult to know who just bit the big one. Nor do you care. Unlike, the original series, the Transformers as characters is less important than the Transformers as spectacle. They are show pieces. Eye candy. Enormous targets for shooting at and blowing up

The plot slightly echoes the original series. The Transformers need energy -- or energon as it is called -- to remain functional. The Decepticons know a way to get said energon, but it involves destroying the sun. Bad news for humans. From here you would think it's the Autobots who are going to stop them from this. But no. Again, Michael bay is not making a Transformers movie. Just an action movie. So it's really the humans -- that is, the United States military -- who are going to stop the Decepticons. Here is where Bay returns to his comfort zone. By diverting this back to a human driven action movie, he can revert to those cliches that make such movies what they are: Type-A male soldiers who are quick on thier feet, quick with their tongue and always in control. Schmucky government beuracrats with flawed rationalizations about what's really happening -- and who will get their just desserts served to them by the Type-A clever soldiers. You'll see more of this than you will actual big scary robots (it's not necessary to call them Transformers anymore).

Oh, and then there's Sam Whitwicky (or however you spell his last name) and his girlfriend. And since this is an action movie, theirs is an action-movie romance. This means all of the eye gazing, and lip puckering is there, but without the sincerity of a real drama. Amazingly, this fast-forward love affair is where Bay devotes a lot of his attention. So I can't believe I'm about to say this: the real problem with Bay's Robot movie is that it takes far too long to get to the spectacle. Sure, he opens with one. But that's a given. All action movies open with action. It's part of the formula. But after the big bang opening, you have to wait about another hour before the second big clash between the robots

When it does come, though, boy what a ride. The big scary robots are fun to watch when they're slugging it out.",1245974400,,3806,4.666169895678093
3441566,3,B0019M5C0Q,"The first ""Transformers"" film may not be faithful to the animated series, not even to the comic book by Marvel comics. Seeing as how Hasbro only utilized those mediums to promote its toy line, I can forgive its inconsistencies to the beloved animated series. The original film by Michael Bay was fun, it utilized a simple formula with little room for a real intricate plot; it was just a popcorn film. After the huge box-office success of Bay's rendition of the ""Transformers"", of course there would be a sequel and ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" fulfills that promise. Bay main goal would have to make the sequel bigger while going deeper into the mythos of our transforming robots. In this sequel, one thing, Michael Bay proves once again is the fact that he is a good director of action sequences but the skill of great storytelling still ELUDES him. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" may be louder and bigger--but it is definitely NOT better.

Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is off to college. Life couldn't be better for the young man, he has a hot girlfriend named Michaela (devastatingly sexy Megan Fox) and his parents are very supportive. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) had joined forces with the U.S. military to hunt down the remaining Decepticons still on Earth. On the day that he is supposed to leave for college, Sam discovers a shard of the `Allspark' from an old sweater, the supposed source of life in Cybertron and his brain ends up being encoded with strange symbols. Prime and his companions come to the aid of the young man, and an encounter with the Decepticons end with a revived Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) sidelining the heroic Optimus Prime. Now it is up to Sam and Michaela to uncover the secret of the Transformers whose history spans hundreds of years on Earth. Aided by his roommate, Leo (miscast Ramon Rodriguez), former sector 7 agent, Simmons (John Turturro) and some old military friends (Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel), Sam must thwart the Fallen's machinations to bring about disaster by stealing the powers of the sun to make Energon through the powers of the ""leadership matrix"" key.

I did not love the first film, but I thought it was fun and somewhat entertaining. It was a popcorn film that relied on slick hyper-editing tricks, CGI mayhem and visual disarray. ""Tranformers"" wasn't anything special but it was a crowd-pleaser, it appealed to mainstream audiences. Somewhere along the way, Michael Bay messed up an easy formula with ""Revenge of the Fallen"". This sequel is a display of pure undisciplined execution. One would ask; ""How can Bay mess up a simple formula?"" Well, it seemed like the director is trying too hard to outshine the original film by exercising the utmost minimum in restraint that relies mostly on rehearsed special effects and overbearing humor. I'm not sure whether he was trying to be funny or to be offensive.

The problems with ""Revenge"" come mostly from its script.  I am not expecting a masterpiece or something that resembles an original plot, but the plot in this film totally uninspired. It's not that it didn't have some aces in the screenplay but somewhere along the way, Bay and company decided to opt for a comedic experience. The history of the robots is somewhat fleshed out, with the ""Fallen"" concept being brought into play. Unfortunately, any relevance to the film's main plot is downplayed by overdone annoying stereotypes in its characters; I am not just talking about the human characters, I am talking about the newer supporting cast of robots. (I will further elaborate in a minute) The Matrix key and the whole thing about the shards may hold some viability in the transformers mythos but sadly, the script falters, the film should be about the robots with the humans as the supporting element not the other way around. I would buy into the human-robot relationship and its significance but the film fails to fully realize this potential; it tosses in the idea but never develops it with emotion. I guess Bay thought that while the audience love to see robots fighting, they also like to laugh, so Bay and his writers puts a lot of emphasis on comedy; not just comic relief but actual comedy.

The film brings a lot of comedy into the screenplay that it makes no emotional or narrative impact. The life and death stakes of saving the planet feels more like a backdrop than an actual inherent part of the screenplay. Any aces from its limited concept are diverted to useless detours from its narrative. The new robots feel like they're mere caricatures of certain stereotypes and the designs aren't impressive either. Most of the newer supporting robots act like they're rejects from some gangster comedy show. The twin `jive-talking' robots, Mudflap and Skids act like they're degenerates and play a very ethnic stereotype. I found their designs and behavior rather unnecessary and quite frankly may raise some racial flags. There is also a small Decepticon spy that behaves like a dog that it began to hump Megan Fox's leg. The film's script falls to many inadequacies and useless devices to try to entertain--to try badly. Using laughs as the central focus of the film diminishes the film's concept. I was NOT laughing at all.

The question remains, does ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" deliver on the ""Heavy Metal"" combat scenes? Yes, it does. The fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron with two other Decepticons was real fun to watch; it was a true testament to the heroic traits of Optimus Prime. The final encounter between a ""maxed-out"" Optimus Prime and ""The Fallen"" one was pretty cool although it threw another wrench in the screenplay. There are plenty of robotic battles and while some of them are good, some are pretty mediocre. It does try to evolve the areas of robotic combat and violence, but most of the new faces such as Sidewinder are ignored. The idea of a human-like Decepticon is sadly also abandoned and not fully fleshed out. We see classic Autobots, Iron Hide, BumbleBee and Decepticons, Soundwave and Rampage. An Insecticon and the Constructicons also make an appearance but their ""Devastator"" looks like a washing machine on steroids. Megatron's master, the Fallen one does look menacing but looks too reminiscent of the Japanese mecha designs. There is also an old Decepticon defector that uses a cane? The battles are good, but most of them feel too routine and a practice in rehearsal--lots of explosions and CGI mayhem does not make the qualities of an epic battle. Peter Cullen does a great voice-acting as Optimus and Hugo Weaving sounds menacing as the sinister Megatron.

The film also features returning characters into the mix. Familiar faces John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel reprises their roles from the original film. Turturro is somewhat entertaining but I really thought that Ramon Rodriguez was definitely a miscast as Leo. Shia LeBeouf is his usual over-acting self, that all he did to express emotion is to widen his eyes with his mouth open. Megan Fox is indeed a Fox! The actress is so seductive as the sexy Mikaela that even a sexy Decepticon (played by Isabel Lucas) almost couldn't compete. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White weren't funny and the pot joke is the type that has been overused by other films.

Maybe I'm being too harsh to the film, but I think I should try to tell the truth. While the film does have some decent gags, the comedy just overstays its welcome. This is a film that assumes that comedy is gold and a scene with two dogs humping the other is a viable plot device. Michael Bay further cements the impression that he DOES NOT care for the franchise at all, and that any success the original film enjoyed was a fluke. I am rather at a loss as to what target audience this film is geared to, that I cannot give it a recommended rating. I suppose to be optimistic, those who just want a mindless summer film, ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" may prove to be a minor diversion--but at 150 minutes the film proves too long. Bay isn't going to elevate this once-beloved franchise to new heights, and sadly, there are already hints at another sequel.

It is a ""FALLEN"" sequel.

3441568,3,B0019M5C0Q,"Heart.  It's something the first ""Transformers"" had in 2007.  Flash forward two years (and millions of dollars) later and the inevitable sequel is upon as, aptly subtitled, ""Revenge of the Fallen.""  Bigger, louder, funnier, more action-packed, and longer are the best way to describe the sequel.  While this may seem like a wet dream to Transformers' fans, it's also dumber, lacks true wit and charm, and at many points, just feels lazy.  It's all quantity over quality.

Two years have passed since the battle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons in Mission City, LA.  Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), leader of the Decepticons, was killed when our young hero, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) shoved the Allspark into his chest and for the time being, everything seemed fine.  Now, signs of Decepticons are showing up all over the world and the government decides to join sides with the Autobots and form NEST, a tactical group aimed to find and hunt down rogue Decepticons.  Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) returns as the Autobot leader, skydiving into Shanghai, China, where he exterminates a Decepticon, not before hearing from the enemy's mouth that the Fallen is coming.  The Fallen is one of the earliest Decepticons and his presence on Earth could mean the end for humanity.  Along with Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and the rest of NEST, Optimus realizes that he may need Sam to help him once more.

Sam has is own problems though.  He's going off to college and that means saddened parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn), a saddened girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox), and a saddened car, Bumblebee.  To add to the mix, he touched a piece of Allspark that was found in his attire he wore the day of Mission City.  All of a sudden he starts seeing symbols that begin to interrupt with his college life.  Eventually, news gets out to the Decepticons that Sam has priceless information in his head that could be the key to bringing Fallen to Earth to continue his reign.  Before you know it, the Decepticons are on Sam's tail as well as Mikaela's, Sam's college roommate, Leo's (Ramon Rodriguez), and the ex-Sector 7 agent, Simmons' (John Turturro).  From Pennsylvania to Washington to Egypt, they race against the clock with Optimus and the Autobots trying to fend the Decepticons off and hoping to stop the Fallen from making an appearance.

""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a mess of a movie.  And here's why...

First, since there are too many storylines, the characters (who we've come to appreciate due to the first film) don't grow whatsoever and I even forgot some were in the movie half the time (the NEST team).  It was like Bay said, ""Oh, wait, I forgot we have these characters over here...Let's cut back to them to show the audience they are still in the movie.""  Another problem with the characters was that we didn't need most of them.  Ramon Rodriguez, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Julie White would have been fine if they were involved in small roles, but they are in the entire film!  They are used only for humor for 99% of the running time, but when the script asks them to be dramatic for that 1%, it just seems out of place.  All the actors are credible though.  It's just that they deserve better.

Second, I didn't care about the Autobots save for Bumblebee.  Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots became cold-blooded killers in this installment.  In the first film, it seemed that wanted to use violence as a last resort when it came to Decepticons, but they're the ones doing the hunting and killing.  They also lack screen time compared to the first outing with Optimus and Bumblebee maybe getting thirty minutes each.  Instead, the audience is treated to the Twins, Mudflap and Skidz, two robots that do get a great scene towards the end of the film, but again, add nothing to the story, but humor that doesn't work.

Third, the whole film felt rushed in both its writing and direction.  Characters and robots aren't developed and I didn't even know or fear any of the Decepticons, especially the Fallen, which is a problem if Bay was trying to make him terrifying.  I didn't care about his feud with Optimus at all or what the point was.  Since the writing isn't great, it just seems like everyone is going through the motions to get from point A to point B and the audience is stuck doing the same.  In terms of direction and editing, it was sloppy at times.  Characters appear and then disappear for the remaining movie for no reason.  Shots were re-used from the first film and even from the same film (they show the same shot of Soundwave and change the audio).  Lazy...  Also, the pacing was off for the film.  The first hour goes by fairly quickly, but then the next hour slows down to a screeching halt.  Finally, the plot of the movie is revealed and at that point, we don't care.

Finally, the special effects and the action scenes were less stellar this time around in my opinion.  It was like the technicians at ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) focused on getting some robots to look incredible while others were passable.  The worst offense is that Optimus Prime did not look good at all in this movie.  In the first, he looked flawless, but now, he looks like a videogame creation.  His character is too shiny, too bright, and walks around like he's made of air and not tons of metal.  Now, while there were more action scenes in this film than the first, I couldn't care at all about what happened (or understand what was happening), especially in the final fight scene.  It goes on for way too long, explosions seem to happen for no reason, you can't tell one Transformer from another, and the Fallen is criminally under-used.  He's supposed to be the ultimate villain of all the Transformers, but he's really just a weakling.  Also, Bay shows us Devastator (who does look awesome), but he does nothing.  He sucks in some sand, terrorizes the comic reliefs of the film, climbs a pyramid, and takes off the top of it.  That's it.  He was so built up in the trailer and he did little to nothing in the film.  What a waste.

Was there anything good to say about the movie?  Actually, yes.  First, the acting was passable with Megan Fox actually being the best (she's gorgeous, but also knows how dumb the movie is) and Shia LaBeouf being the worst.  His dialogue consisted of ""No! No! No!"", ""Optimus!, and ""Bumblebee!"" on repeat.  I could have played Sam Witwicky, dude.  While I didn't care for the action on a whole, the forest fight pitting Optimus against Megatron, Grindor, and Starscream was neat (although so similar to King Kong fighting three Rexes) and Bumblebee taking on two Decepticons was cool.  The special effects were tight for the most part besides what I talked about and finally, Steve Jablonsky's score.  These movies could be god-awful, but his music would always be epic and wonderfully done.

So...did I have a good time at the movies?  Yes and no.  I thought the film was fun at some parts, the action was well shot, and had some good comedy, but it wasn't what I came to see.  I wanted to see an epic fight between Autobots and Decepticons, learn more about them, and see an all out war.  Instead, I got Shia LaBeouf with alien robots on the side.  The plot was less than great, I didn't care for any robots (Bumblebee still rocks though), the humor was not needed at all, sloppy direction and writing at times, and some rushed special effects hindered what could have been the movie of '09.  I really wanted to like this film, but it came across as just so-so.  It has everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster, but it lacks something crucial, which the first ""Transformers"" had.

The key to the Decepticons evil plot is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeuof) after he learns the truth behind the origins of the Transformers.

I love movies so I went to go see it anyway and boy did it suck. The Decepticons looked awesome but the movie followed every basic summer blockbuster cliche known to man. Here are some problems I hate with the film

The red and green car followed Sam around and the little truck robot were all stereotypes. Red and green acted like gangsta's and reminded me of Jar Jar Binks in a way. They were so friggin annoying. The truck played off as a wise guy from Brooklyn. He reminded me of Frank from Men in Black but less cuter to look at.

Sex. A movie staring Megan Fox had sex in it and it wasn't five stars?! Well if you consider two dogs humping and that little truck robot humping Megan Fox's leg as hot, then I guess you got issues.

John Turturro's character in this movie was a direct rip off of Randy Quaid's character in Independence Day.

Megan Fox was a sexy, there is no arguing that. She looked alot like Angelina Jolie in this film but way would you film more then half here scenes in slow-motion? But damn, she is friggin smoking.

The humor was the kind of quick chuckle but doesnt last long kind. Make sense? I didn't laugh at anything in here but im sure plenty of people laughed at Sam's mom high on brownies. There was anther annoying character, sorry to digress but this film had some really annoying characters in it.

The story lacked suspense as you could tell what was going happen before it happened.

I cant really say I enjoyed to much of the film. The bad guys looked cool, some fights were pretty neat, and Megan Fox is smoking hot.

All in all, it's a summer film. It's an escape from work or too get the kids off your back for a few hours. It's entertainment and not the meaning of life. I may have crapped on this film but I know thousands of people will go away saying it was the greatest film this summer or of all time.",1245974400,2,1997,4.209424083769633

Sure, it was silly and cheesy, but within the movie's concept of ""logic,"" it was both forgiveable and fun.  It was exactly what I expected it to be, no more and no less.

This film was much, much less.  So much less that even the spectacular fight scenes grew tiresome and monotonous.

Here's the skinny:

The plot is breath-takingly idiotic.  Sam's home is beseiged by a dozen or so tiny (and seemingly spontaneous) Decepticon bots right before he leaves for college.  Bumblebee jumps in and (chaotically) saves the day.  Moments later, Sam tells Bumblebee that he isn't taking the Autobot with him to college for reasons that make no sense whatsoever.  Add to this an annoying and absurd subplot about Sam having difficulty saying the ""love"" word to his uber-perfect girlfriend.

About that girlfriend: scriptwriters, please give your characters flaws.  Megan Fox's character is perfect in every conceivable way, from her patience with Sam to the sultry way she bends over engines as she fixes them.  She and Sam have endured life-changing (and -threatening) situations together, and yet, Sam still can't bring himself to tell her how much she means to him.  As soon as the couple begins arguing about the ""L"" word, you know immediately what the climax of the film will entail.

The Earth has also been beset with an unusually high number of violent and high-profile Decepticon attacks.  In the face of this, what does the American government do?  In the greatest plot contrivance of all, a liason from the president not only kicks the Autobots off the planet, he does so with a speech that conveniently (for the audience and the Decepticon) lays out every weakness and detail of the country's experience with the Transformers.

These are just a few of the film's gaping holes.  In order to distract from these, the creators added the following window dressing, ostensibly to titillate and amuse:

--a pointless scene involving Sam's mom and some illegal brownies

--two jive-talking robots with golden buck teeth and huge ears; when these characters first appeared, I turned to a friend who had come with me to the IMAX and said, ""Is it just me, or are those things racist?""  My friend held up his forefinger and thumb and said, ""Yeah.  Just a bit.""

--a new kind of Decepticon that stretches credulity; let's just say it can shift into some really hot shapes

--the robots are given more human characteristics than ever before, including breath, farts, and anatomically correct groins

Other things I couldn't help but notice:

--it takes the Decepticons roughly five minutes to break into and take over a top-secret, ultra-secure military compound, but they have an extraordinary amount of difficulty stealing a purse from an 18 year old girl on a motorbike

--Sam's dormroom is so full of gorgeous coeds that they actually have a character explain the abnormal ratio of hot chicks

--Rainn Wilson is under-utilized as a smarmy professor in a classroom scene that contributes almost nothing to the plot

--a military official, when he receives an anonymous transmission from a character telling him to fire the government's most dangerous, most top secret weapon at one of the three pyramids in Egypt only hesitates about half a second before going ahead and doing it

--Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox have absolutely no chemistry this time around; it took me about five minutes to realize that they were flirting when they started talking about breaking up.

3441573,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Weak script that doesn't involve the viewer on any emotional level whatsoever.  It's just a bunch of special effects, and characters not doing things a reasonable person would do, like Sam telling his Autobot friends at the outset that he has part of the All-Spark.

Why oh why did the filmmakers sit their two main Autobot heroes, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, on the sidelines for most of the picture?  What in the world were they thinking?

Great visual effects, but most of the time you can't get into the emotion of the action because you can't tell whose pounding on who, how their damaging each other, and sometimes if they're Decepticons or Autobots.

And what's with the overly crude humor, especially when we know young kids are going to see this, either in the theater or on DVD?  To have two scenes of real dogs humping, then another with an autobot humping Megan Fox's leg like a dog in heat went beyond the pale of good taste.  Didn't this idea start off as a cartoon?
Hence, let's assume that lot's of young kids are going to be seeing it!?

I saw it in a packed theater at night, and not one person laughed at any of the jokes.  Everyone was just kind of in shock at the crudeness of the jokes, as having Sam's mother telling girls at his college that she was in the house when ""his cherry got popped.""

C'mon guys.  Take a lesson from ""Star Wars"" and don't do this with a film that is akin to a superhero movie with a younger audience.

3441574,1,B0019M5C0Q,"To say that I was disappointed in this movie wouldn't be accurate, because it implies that certain expectations weren't met. In this case, I have to say it's quite the opposite: This movie lived down to my expectations, and pushed them even lower as time went on.

As with the first film in this series, this was nothing but a special effects extravaganza. The problem with this comes from the fact that such a movie doesn't have a story, a plot, or any character development. Like the first movie, I didn't care, at all, about the outcome. I didn't care at all about who lived or died, and in many cases couldn't even tell the robots apart well enough to tell who lived or died.

Anytime a movie fails to have a compelling story or characters I can care about, I find myself paying little to no attention to it, and this movie was no different. The action was there purely for the sake of being there, and for that's not entertaining, that's boring. In a movie like that, where the actors could almost be replaced by trained chimps, you wouldn't expect the acting itself to make a difference. Unfortunately, this is not something this movie makes it possible to find out, as the acting was as bad as the story. Maybe it was the lack of material for them to work with, or maybe it was just that the actors weren't very good, something I find hard to believe in some cases, but they did their jobs about as well as the writers did theirs.

The only redeeming quality this movie had was the quality of the CGI work. It was, if possible, even better than the work on the previous movie in this series. The only downside, again, was the design of the robots, something ILM probably doesn't have much say in.

Overall, this movie was horrible, and I'd say the critics have been exceedingly generous with their mediocre reviews. Movies should have more going for them than this one does.",1245888000,11,1881,4.475218658892128

Then they show megatron coming out of the ocean and then standing on some planet. Just stupid!!  The only thing good were the special effects.,1245888000,3,308,4.666666666666667
3441576,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Tis the season is usually a phrase you hear at the beginning of November to signify the beginning of ""The Holiday"" Season, but in the past few years another time of year has sprung up to take a bite out of the calender. It begins about the beginning of May and usually runs to the end of July or sometimes beginning of August, and it's called ""The Popcorn Movie"" Season; aka ""The Blockbuster Movie"" Season.  It's the time of year where you can escape the gaggle of giggly little brats that pass you in line and block the aisle in front of your favorite dvd section, texting one another; and grab a cold drink and a popcorn the size of your grandma's purse and sit in a theater with the thermostat set to 25 below and get comfortable, turn your brain off from all the thoughts of bills you need to pay, what's going on at your job, how are you gonna get your wedding ring unstuck from the drain your 3 year old threw it in; and just enjoy a film.  No need to over think, no need to criticize what's going on in the film, as long as it gives EXACTLY what is expected, no problems.

Obviously, I am one of very few out there who understand this universal concept; and understand that Michael Bay is not an Oscar Winning Director, nor an Oscar Winning Screen Writer. If you went in to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen expecting anything other than big BAD robots and big GOOD robots beating the ever living snot out of one another, then you most likely went to see the wrong film.

Let me just say a few words on most of the attacks being made on the film in general.  First, that there is no plot.  Um...it's Transformers, what plot...think of a paper thin reason to get the Decepticons and the Autobots fighting, a halfway decent reason to add a few choice humans and you have a plot, and by the way; said plot wasn't that bad.  We follow Sam Witwicky (Shai LeBeuf) to College, but before he goes he finds a shard of the Allspark (the big cube thing from the original) and it transfers important info into Sam's head.  He begins to have a meltdown in school, enter Mikeala (the ever HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT! Megan Fox!) to save his butt! and the rest falls into place much better than the original.  Where as in the first all roads were focused on ""what the crap is going on?"" in several different ways, all roads lead to ""KEEP SAM ALIVE!!!!""

Now for the ""racism"" thing.  We live in the 21st century where three year olds know slang that would have made a sailor blush 30 years ago.  Many critics are attacking the addition of Autobot twins Mudflap and Skids saying they are racist stereotypes. I must have a VERY different definition of racism.  Slurs, comments directed at a person for their color, sex, sexual preference, age, etc. all are forms of racism.  Why is it that only the afformentioned Autobots are the only ones getting bashed, what about Jetfire? Stereotype of elderly?  The jock kids at the frat party...stereotype... Mikeala herself a stereotype. The Twins used no derogatory comments toward any race, sex or age group at all.  They are getting bashed for a look and a way of speech.  They and almost all the characters in the film are some form of stereotype.  So what's the big deal? how many films DON'T have stereotypes of somesort or another.  In fact the world as a whole is pretty much a stereotype.  Look at the media around you and tell me if there is much of anything that isn't.  Plus, you can't really call an asexual transforming machine a racist.  It's a dang machine!  I will admit though that there was some language from some of the Autobots; mainly Wheelie and the Twins; that aren't really for kids, but the film isn't PG, it's PG-13!!!

Anyway, enough fussing.  The action sequences were AMAZING! The opening sequence in Shanghai between Optimus/Human soldier's and the new Decepticon Demolisher is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Also, the battle in the forest between Optimus and Megatron and Starscream was EYE POPPING WOW!!!  Needless to say, the effects were INSANE! As if the first films visuals weren't good, this one takes them one step farther.  The believability of the Transformers being in the film not added to the film was more so here than the first.  Plus, the action never really lets up.  From a funny action scene involving the Allspark shard at the Witwicky house at the beginning to the final battle between Optimus and The Fallen at the End, the War between the Transformers is epic in visual size.

The humor was also bigger and more outlandish, to my strange delight.  From Mrs. Witwicky eating pot brownies and going ape s**t, to Wheelie going all ""dog friendly"" with Mikeala's leg. There is alot of humor, both kid friendly and not so much.  In fact, I think that there was alot more adult humor that kid humor.  There was more foul language for sure.

The acting was also on par.  Shia is a fantastic actor and his comedic moments were the best part of the film.  Megan Fox, is an okay actress, but we don't go see her to watch her act, well we watch ""something"" act but not her per say.  John Tutorro is hilarious but not used nearly enough, and Josh Duhamal and Tyrese as soldiers Lennox and Epps do what they are there to do, fight with the Autobots.  But, to put it bluntly, this film really; unlike the first film; belongs to the Transformers, as it should, heck the film is entitled Transformers.

There are also many new things to look for, we have familiar Transformers.  Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide and Ratchet return; but Arcee, and an old Transformer named Jetfire make their film debuts.  Also, Megatron returns from the dead, with Starscream by his side, we get to see an updated version of Soundwave now a really cool looking satellite dish and his little tiger like minion Ravage, plus of course the main bad Megatrons master The Fallen who is to my slight dismay underused for such a cool looking character.  Also, little nods to pretender Decepticons are thrown in, as well as Dinobots...well kinda, and a few other little surprises.

Over all the film is a simple to understand, mindless, epic Popcorn Blockbuster Movie.  It's not Citizen Kane people and it's not Gumby either.  Over all, the new Autobots show different personalities whether we as a mass accept them as such or not, and I enjoyed the film as a whole VERY much.  In fact, I plan to go see it again in theaters and will most positively be getting it on Blu Ray when it hits.",1245888000,7,6404,4.53437771975631
3441577,4,B0019M5C0Q,"Watching this mammoth movie, it was obvious that Michael Bay's intention for this sequel was bigger, louder, funnier, more more more.

Is it just me, or am I the only one who liked the original for the quirky humour of the characters. I mean the first half of the original film was really entertaining. Watching Sam stumble over Megan foxx and his parents embarassing him. And the robots... yeh they are pretty cool but how many times can we marvel in the autobots transforming.

And yeh in Transformers 2 I enjoyed the non-action scenes more, and I usually roll my eyes at one liners but I found it pretty funny in this. Admittedly Megan Foxx has been reduced to bending over half the time... but thats fine. This was mindless fun... with lots of things blowing up. Once in a while, if its entertaining I don't mind watching something like this.

It was a bit long though... the last half hour was getting a bit too much. Everything about this movie was excessive. Even the comedown in the last half hour.

But the main point is that I paid for a ticket and was entertained well for that 3 hours. Nothing more promised nothing more expected.

Im no huge transformers fan, I don't really care about the complaints others are making... (more insight about the deceptacons etc...).",1245888000,3,1279,4.616740088105727
3441578,4,B0019M5C0Q,"First and foremost, let's get the positives out of the way.  The action and special effects in this movie are incredible.  It's nothing less than one would expect.  During all the battle scenes, and especially during the scenes around the pyramids, there are some incredible, sphincter-tightening, tense moments.  For sci-fi fans and special effects fans, this may well be in the pantheon.  Transformers II is a ""shut your brain off"" good time, with explosions, transforming cars, crisp action scenes, and a decent enough plot that has the feel of a National Treasure sequel.  But with alien cars that can shape-shift.  And speaking of that, this movie makes a significant improvement over the original by giving more attention to the Transfromers and less to the humans.  Now that that's out of the way...

Let me get this right.  Shia Lebouf's character goes away to college, leaving the impossibly hot Megan Fox and his shape-shifting car back home?  Let's back up one second, because that's just too colossally ridiculous.

He leaves Megan Fox - who is clearly about 500 miles, 250 football fields, and 98 fathoms out of his range - his current girlfriend that will epically dwarf all other possible girls and/or women with which he'll ever be with, or probably even see in college (read: ever), to go to a far off college that requires a webcam for communication?  You're telling me there wasn't a diesel engine tech school nearby?  Any time an integral story arc derives from American Pie II, and the movie is not meant as a ridiculous yet enjoyable comedy, it's usually a bad thing (even Jim realized he screwed up by leaving Nadia and would never have a chance with a woman like that again).  All of this, of course, is secondary on the WTF-scale to the fact that he actually leaves Bumblebee behind.

Bumblebee, his sentient, alien, shape-shifting car who not only helped Shia land Megan Fox, but also helped save his life, and can pull up any song in the history of songs on merely a whim - which is like having a 1-million disc CD-changer - being abandoned is just too hard for me to believe, even if it is a Michael Bay blockbuster without common sense.

It's a fun movie with a few unnecessary parts, and some really stupid humor shoved in, but overall I'd recommend it (mainly for Megan Fox and the action).",1245888000,4,2321,4.733830845771144
3441579,2,B0019M5C0Q,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has a lot of flaws. Some are easier to overlook than others, especially with the nearly indescribable amount of mayhem exploding across the screen. While the CG effects have virtually perfected giant robots destroying everything in sight, the story department seems to have digressed into conjuring up outlandish situations that require even more preposterous solutions. Similar to the creation of Kryptonite to offset the invulnerability of Superman, several plot devices are devised as a way to counterbalance overly invincible Transformers, themselves created just to compete with the power of Autobot leader Optimus Prime. But of course, story isn't likely the primary reason to go see this film, and on an action scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a tank truck hitting a helicopter and 10 is an aircraft carrier colliding with a nuclear submarine, Revenge of the Fallen rates about an 11.

Two years after the harrowing events of the first Decepticon attack on Earth, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) attempts to lead the normal life of a college student. But contending with overbearing parents, conspiracy-obsessed roommates, and a long distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) gives way to fending off lethally aggressive girls, alien symbol-induced mental breakdowns, and once again saving the world from transforming robots intent on destroying the universe.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen certainly proves that bigger is not better. In its attempt to outdo the first film with louder sound effects, more destructive explosions, bulkier robots and grander comedy relief, it fails to square off against the appeal of its predecessor: originality. The transformations, the battles, the firepower, and the obnoxious amount of side characters are just too familiar; nothing about this sequel boasts an increase in creativity, just a boost in excess.

This plays into the use of plot contrivances - those pesky solutions to the random problems that are pointlessly devised to keep the story complex and always changing. While most are so drastically unpredictable that knowing about them would ruin the surprise, the plot suffers from a lack of rules. Since the limits of almost everything surrounding the Transformers are never clearly defined, Revenge of the Fallen runs amok creating new origins, lore, abilities, characters and boundaries of mortality, with little rhyme, reason or concern. When a space bridge is introduced for brief teleportation, it's both unnecessary and completely unconvincing. And that's a problem in a movie about alien creatures that camouflage themselves as mechanical vehicles, which starts with little basis in reality in the first place.

Almost the entire cast of the original returns, with even more new characters thrown into the mix; much of their involvement is for a few extra laughs that add nothing but running time. The witty banter between father, mother and son is almost too much to bear, the racial stereotype Transformers (Mudflap and Skids) are like Jar Jar Binks at best, and Megan Fox remains spotlessly clean no matter how many explosions she gets thrown from or the number of times she rolls around in the dirt. Design elements from The Matrix, Species, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and more make their way into this lengthy continuation, and despite the spectacular special effects and insanely monstrous new enemies, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen can't offer enough truly fresh material to warrant this overlong, mind-bogglingly destructive summer blockbuster. It did, however, introduce twin Transformers.
