8060657,1,B0009H9X2U,"I have something of a masochistic streak -- if a review hails something as ""the worst movie/book/show/anime ever made,"" I have to check it out for myself and see if it's really as bad as they say.  Most of the time, the reviews are right, yet I keep at it somehow.  And when multiple websites declared the OVA ""Mars of Destruction"" as the worst anime of all time, I was actually intrigued enough that I wanted to check it out for myself.  It was only 20 minutes long, surely it couldn't be that bad, right?  There's only so much fail you can pack into twenty minutes, after all.

The reviews were true, folks -- this is BAAAAAD.  Not quite ""so bad it's good"" quality, but still so hilariously bad that you wonder if the makers were TRYING to make the worst production possible.

""Mars of Destruction"" starts off with a bang -- a Mars exploration ship, returning to Earth from a mission, burns up in the atmosphere.  From there the action cuts to a team of foot soldiers (inexplicably all teenage girls) facing off against a group of aliens called the Ancients.  We learn (via some ham-handed exposition) that the Ancients have been menacing Tokyo for some time, and a team of what are supposedly the top recruits of the police force but are actually teen girls and a whiny young man in a biomechanical suit have been selected to fight against them.  The team takes on the mission of escorting a transport carrying fragments from the Mars exploration vessel to an American lab for study, only to be ambushed by more of the ancients along the way.  But the Ancients have a specific reason for attacking Earth... and said reason uncovers a shocking secret about humanity itself.

One of the major flaws of this OVA is that it's way too short.  It's entirely possible to tell a compelling story in a short amount of time -- the 2D ""Clone Wars"" cartoon and many of Pixar's short films are proof of this.  But if you're working with a limited running time, you have to know what you're capable of including and what has to be left out, and how to work everything necessary into the time you have.  ""Mars of Destruction"" has no idea what it's doing -- it tries to cram way too much into 20 minutes, and despite its short running time it includes pointless filler, such as astronauts bantering about getting drinks or a pointless flashback to the mecha-suit-wearing teen's abusive father.  The OVA either needed a longer running time, or a simpler script with the unnecessary details trimmed out.

The animation is rather horrible too.  It has a jerky look that makes it look like frames of animation are missing, there are countless still shots even during ""action"" scenes, and poses are so stiff it's like this world is populated by mannequins.  Most of the designs are pretty lackluster too, with the girl-soldiers' uniforms, the Mars exploration vessel, and the Ancients all looking frightfully generic.  (The mecha suit looked pretty neat, but that's the sole bright spot.)  The most hilariously bad example of the bad animation is when one of the girl soldiers gets her head blown off in battle -- a fountain of blood shoots straight up out of her neck, without arcing or raining down, and her body falls out of the shot in the EXACT same pose she was in when she was shot.  Talk about corner-cutting...

The story itself could have been an interesting one.  There are all sorts of tidbits that, if fleshed out, could have made a compelling story, and hints are made at past events that could have added to the story.  But a good premise is squandered in favor of... I'm not sure what exactly.  The final revelation of the Ancients could have made an awesome show or movie in its own right, but it's treated as little more than an attempt at a shock ending.  And there's no characterization whatsoever -- all the girl soldiers look and act the same, and the boy gets no characterization beyond ""whiny scared teen.""  Again, it's possible to make characters one can care about in a short amount of time, but here it's like no one even tried.

There are countless other examples of bad quality and unintentional hilarity in this short film, and listing them all would take almost more time than the OVA's running time.  Why the public domain soundtrack, including using the freaking ""Barber of Seville"" to accompany a FIGHT SCENE?  Why does the abusive father sound like the Cookie Monster and most of the Ancients like Animal from the Muppets?  What's up with the crucifix-shaped chamber the boy uses to get suited up -- symbolism much?  Also, why include the mecha suit if it gives the wearer no advantages whatsoever in a fight?  Even with the suit on the boy fares no better than the girl soldiers in fights against the Ancients, and only a blatant Deus Ex Machina gives him any shot at victory.

Several reviews have pointed out that this OVA rips off ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" at several points.  As I haven't seen that show, I can't judge whether it's a ripoff or not, but if it is it's just more points against this... thing.

Supposedly this OVA was made to promote a video game by the same name, but judging by the fact that no one seems to have heard of the game, I'm guessing it failed at its job.  What it managed to do was gain infamy among the anime community, and become the laughingstock of said community.  It's probably best enjoyed with a group of anime nerd friends, where everyone can laugh and make fun of it together MST3K style.  Just DON'T waste your money buying the DVD -- it's quite easy to find on YouTube, and free to boot.  You'll only be wasting 20 minutes of your life.",1408406400,3,5598,4.574724172517553
