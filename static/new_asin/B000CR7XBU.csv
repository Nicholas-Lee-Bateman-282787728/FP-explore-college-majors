Professionally created, with great actors and examples, it highlights the most fundamental elements of key physics laws, with illustrations and examples that are easy to understand for young kids (example: when discussion on gravity and motion, a basketball and a tennis ball orbiting the Earth are used as examples.
Very good, indeed!",1317427200,,405,5.151515151515151
8101060,3,B000CR7XBU,"This video is excellent for children to begin learning about physics. I'm twenty eight, and I overlooked the description and bought this not realizing it was a child's dvd. That was okay with me because my physics knowledge is pretty much at a kindergarten level, and this was a easy place to start my learning. Pretty embarrassing,though! Also, the dvd doesn't play all through, you can watch each law of physics section separately, so if your kid has a 3 second attention span, that's okay because each section is quite short.",1223164800,3,528,4.813186813186813
