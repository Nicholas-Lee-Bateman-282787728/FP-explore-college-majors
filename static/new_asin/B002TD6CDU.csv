8380090,5,B002TD6CDU,"This movie is a documentary for adult die-hards.  It's not for kids, as the subject matter is mostly businesslike and occasionally risque or vulgar. This will tell you what it's like to get hired, to go to work every day, and to be one of the few dozen alchemical wizards (or just golden geese) in the entire world who know how to perform one of the newest, most wonderful, and most high-demand trades in a freewheeling yet oppressive startup. The storytellers are overwhelmingly kind and generous people -- master toymakers with a lifestyle of portraying the genius inner child. The stories include a *LOT* of hard drugs right in the office, some sex, extensively diabolical pranks, and other mature language.

It tells the story of actual life at Atari, from the perspective of being an employee within a big business, and from the perspective of being a creative and intellectual designer within a stuffy marketing-driven mini-megacorporation.  Cuz the marketing guys apparently sucked, but weren't interviewed.  And it is about being a freewheeling rockstar Silicon Valley personality in the 1970s and 1980s. It tells a bit of technical info -- not so much about how to make Atari games, but what it was like to be a designer of Atari games.  It's got the thought process on how to come up with game ideas, and how the flow of ideas came into a lineage of software releases. All within the pressures and wonders of life at the exploding young Atari corporation.",1439683200,,1465,4.844
8380091,2,B002TD6CDU,"Based upon other reviews and comments, you'd think this video would include more about the technical aspects of Atari and detailed information about the games themselves.  Instead, the video is more like a high school reunion focusing primarily on the personal relationships between the employees, reminiscing mostly on how drunk they got and how many drugs they did.  If you're hoping for a documentary touching base on the actual game designs and technical aspect of the VCS system itself, this is not the video you're looking for.  There are 4 episodes included and each of them seems like watching the previous one over and over again.  It is very drawn-out and boring.  Definitely not worth the $30 the main website is asking.  If you really think you want it, try to find it very cheap used.",1416268800,2,797,4.823529411764706
8380092,5,B002TD6CDU,"Howard Scott Warshaw writer of the ""Worst Video Game Ever"" ET and the ""Best 2600 original"" Yars Revenge makes a documentary from the inside of Atari",1405123200,,148,4.730769230769231
8380093,5,B002TD6CDU,"Four different episodes are included in this documentary, filmed between 1999 and the early 2000s where Howard Scott Warshaw (designer of successes such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and disasters like E.T. for the Atari 2600) interviews a few programmers and managers who worked at Atari between the late 70s and early 80s, each describing their experiences, successes and struggles.

Despite getting rarer and rarer to find, this DVD is a must have for everyone interested in game development during the early 80s.",1320019200,5,513,5.107142857142857
