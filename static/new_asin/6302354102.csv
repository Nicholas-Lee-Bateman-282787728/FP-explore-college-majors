454203,4,6302354102,"As a youth living in the Windsor,Ontario, Canada  area I enjoyed watching the selection of 60's and 70's movies that the old independent WDIV Detroit channel 50 used to broadcast.  One of my fondest recollections was watching this perky, happy, comedy.  A decade and a half later I decided to purchase the movie to see if it lived up to my memories...
There is excellent on-screen chemistry between Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood.  Bacall and Fonda were also well cast in supporting roles.  (Fonda, as a panyhouse salesman, must look at women's legs to keep on eye on the competition.  Bacall, his wife and former panyhouse model is jealous because she thinks its for pleasure and not business)
Mel Ferrer is also cast in the movie.  I remember seeing him portray King Arthur in the 50's(?) movie, ""Knights of the Round Table"".
What I really enjoyed about the movie (besides the character interactions) was the use of detail to poke fun at the burgeoning consumer/automated society of the time.  The scene where the Stop Magazine CEO must insert coins to drink from the machine only to get a bare mouthful of water sets the stage for later humourous scenes.  At lunch time, Tony Curtis and a co-worker insert coins into vending machines to get their coffee, food and dessert.  Tony concludes the scene by saying ""This one's on me"" by placing the tip into another slot.  In the bathrooms coins are also needed to use the facilities.  They must rush to make full use of water and to make haste to comb their hair because the mirrors are on a timer.
The movie was an excellent 1960's piece in that it gives the viewer a glimpse into the values and style of that period.  The scene with Fonda and Bacall dancing at their wedding anniversary was a real eye opener.  I'm sure that that style of dancing was hip then, but today...
After telling my fiance about the movie, she watched it with me. She didn't like it as much as I did.  The movie portrayed the secretary as the sexual plaything of the boss and the ending had Helen Brown setting aside her practice to get married and raise children.  To my fiance's Y2K mind set, she found such notions outdated.
Despite these comments, I found the movie quite enjoyable.  If you like 60's movies, then you will find that this is one of the best comedy's of that period.",985046400,23,2308,4.576642335766423
454204,5,6302354102,"Did you hear that Helen Gurly Brown, psychologist  and head of The International Institute of Advanced  Marital and Premarital Studies Organization, is a  virgin? Natalie Wood plays Helen, a woman giving  advice to many about things she knows nothing  about. When Bob Weston (played by Tony Curtis),  editor of a local scandal magazine, finds out that this  seemingly lascivious author of ""Sex and the Single  Girl"" might be writing about uncharted territory, he  thinks it's the perfect smear for his magazine. So in  order to get the dirty scoop on Helen, Bob acts the  part of a man seeking advice about his failing  marriage. After a few visits and a suicide threat if  Helen doesn't agree to have an affair with him, it  seems as though editor Bob Weston's conscience  might be getting the best of him. Is it due to the fact  that he may be falling for Helen? Will he be able to  go through with his plan and write the foul article  that The Chief (played by Edward Everett Horton)  is awaiting? And will poor, naive Helen be able to  forgive his deceitfulness? These questions come to a  fold at the end, but not without that action-packed  car chase that is so popular with movies of this  genre.",974505600,3,1203,4.597156398104265

The movie set in the early 60s seems very dated now, but it's just as well done as I remembered, if a bit implausible. A great pairing of both Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda, and of Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis. My daughter watched this with me and found Natalie's character of Helen Brown, supposedly the same age as my daughter is now, quite old-fashioned and naive. But I didn't want this for realism, just for escape, and I'm very happy I finally own it.",1398556800,,585,4.2792792792792795

Combine Henry Fonda with Curtis, Natalie Wood, Lauren Bacall and Mel Ferrer and you have a madcap movie that will keep you laughing throughout.

454709,3,6302354102,"This is a typical 60s film about the boiling social change that was going on at the time.  It is unrealistic in the extreme, has strange characters who hardly attempt to be consistent, and it all comes to a crazy climax, complete with a car chase and changing of partners.

The ""sexual revolution"" is just beginning and a professional woman (a therapist) has written a book that is helping to provide some of the spark.  This brings her to the attention of a sleazy tabloid, at which Tony Curtis works.  He poses as his neighbor, a man who is in a troubled marriage (Fonda and Bacall) to get close to Wood and expose her methods and nutty personality.  In the process, Curtis and Wood begin to fall for each other and transform themselves.

What is odd is that the Wood character is named for the real author of the book, Helen Gurley Brown, who was a magazine editor.  The book was a best seller and is one of the iconic early feminist texts.  But here, no doubt with HGB's permission, they turn it into a complete farce.  There must be some back story to this!

As a viewing experience, if you turn off your inner critic it is very fun.  I got a bit tired of the antics toward the end, particularly the car chase.  While I grew up on this kind of screwball comedy, my teenage daughter enjoyed it as well (which surprised me, but she is a retro Natalie Wood fan).  I doubt we will watch it again, but enjoyed it.

She commented that the magazine industry doesn't seem to have changed. I love the set and costume design on this. I enjoy the car chase in the end. It's hard to decide who stole the movie from its stars.. It's a three-way tie  between Henry Fonda, Lauren Bacall, and Mel Ferrer. Very amusing.

454747,5,6302354102,"""Sex and the Single Girl"" succeeds almost 50 years later as both a wacky ""adult comedy"" of its time and as a sociological time capsule of the prevailing attitudes and styles of the mid-60's.  IF you're properly tolerant of the now-quaint comedy style of a bygone era paraded here, ""SATSG"" proves to be an enduring nugget of classic movie ""pixie dust"" that will continue to charm through multiple viewings.

Of course it helps if (like me, born 1957) you're a boomer who lived through ""those days"" and remembers vividly those crazy go-go '60's, with all of its kaleidoscopic turbulence and tumult.  ""SATSG"" zooms in to re-examine a topic we'll never exhaust--the tug-of-war of courtship and romance as women and men struggle to ""hook up"" and sustain relationships over time.

I never learned what Helen Gurley Brown thought of this flippant trashing of her book, which definitely WAS intended to be a call to action for modern girls of the early sixties to live their dreams and joust as equals with men in careers AND in ""scoring"" romantically.  Another author once made the trenchant comment that when you sell a property to Hollywood, you're really giving it up for ""mining rights"" and what eventually emerges will have only a slight resemblance to the original work.  NEVER truer than with ""SATSG""!  I suspect Helen (like most authors) simply rolled her eyes and cashed the check.

Here the book's themes are just used as the set-up for a 60's sex farce, with pioneering liberated psychologist (and author of the current best seller non-fiction work ""Sex and the Single Girl"") Helen Gurley Brown (Natalie Wood) being manipulated for an expose by the underhanded, ""anything for a scoop"" ace reporter of ""Stop"" magazine, Bob Weston (Tony Curtis, in full, leering hound-dog mode).  Bob is determined to find out--at any cost-- whether or not the dewy ingenue, Dr Brown, could possibly be speaking from experience (with a heavily notched bedpost) or (more likely) that she's ""giving flying lessons but she's never actually been up in the air"".

I'm not going to test your patience with a full plot synopsis here. Suffice it to say that all sorts of improbably kooky scenarios are spun and wrung for maximum cliched laughs; indeed, some of it is PAINFUL to watch now.  When I first saw ""SATSG"" on DVD just a couple years ago, I thought, stunned, that  ""Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall would probably like to burn EVERY print of this movie"".  Indeed, here's Henry, quoted from his Playboy interview in Dec 1981 (question: ""what film was the most awful of all""): ""SATSG...  My agents talked me into it, because they said, you SOB, you're not going to make a living out of Ox-Bow Incident and 12 Angry Men.  They can win awards, but they don't make any money.  In order to indulge yourself to do films like that, every so often you've got to be in box-office pictures.  They were right--it was a terrible picture, but it was box office.""

Henry and Lauren Bacall play a miserable middle-aged married couple (in contrast to single, glamorous Wood & Curtis) and both venerable actors are obliged to shriek and cower here as buffoonish caricatures of a stagnant marriage.  Poor Lauren Bacall--a mere ten years earlier she was still a pinnacle for male desire in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Written-on-the-Wind-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005BCK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Written on the Wind (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;(HIGHLY recommended), but now is reduced to a spiteful shrewish housewife. HOWEVER even in these undignified roles I was nevertheless struck by how good they both looked, and how they would NOT be considered ""decrepit and over the hill"" today (in their 40's), as they are automatically assumed to be in their ""SATSG"" personas.

No matter how well you can tolerate the stereotypes and clunky jokes that likely ring hollow today, let's be GRATEFUL that DVD can keep the memory and indelible image of NATALIE WOOD alive for us now and for future viewers.  This is certainly not her finest hour as an actress (let's go with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splendor-in-the-Grass/dp/B001LPWGGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splendor in the Grass</a>&nbsp;for that) but she gamely digs into the material and is an absolute KNOCKOUT throughout the movie (check out her Cleopatra eye make up!  Crazy, Man!).  Such a unique slice of Hollywood life she lived, and how especially tragic her loss.  RJ Wagner at the very least ought to be carrying a Chappaquiddick size anvil of guilt to his grave for his complicity in her death.  (Recommended biography:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natasha-The-Biography-of-Natalie-Wood/dp/0609809571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood</a>)  TONY CURTIS likewise gives the part his all with his usual leering gusto.  Unfortunately Tony was called upon to play this exact same type of part MANY times over the course of the '60's, and it overshadows what a GOOD actor he was capable of being (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Smell-of-Success-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004CIIXG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Smell of Success (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]).

--Oh yeah, the comic artistry of the redoubtable LARRY STORCH also!!!  Larry (best known for his run on the '60's TV sitcom ""F Troop"") does his patented splenetic live-action cartoon bit as a harried motorcycle cop in the last reel freeway chase scene of ""SATSG"".  I also have to wedge in at least a sentence to note--and admire--the va-va-voom allure of Fran Jeffries as Tony's jaded girlfriend, Gretchen.  Another one dimensional character, but let's face it, this is NOT Edward Albee/Tennessee Williams territory we're in here!

Henry Fonda--with all due respect, this is anything BUT a terrible movie!  OK I'll admit there are a LOT of valid reasons to dislike ""SATSG"".  You COULD dismiss it today as just ""kitsch"" and I really couldn't argue with you. The male/female interactions are ridiculous or worse, and the resolution of Natalie/Tony's sparring COULD leave some sputtering with disbelief if not indignation.  Nevertheless, Natalie's beauty and appeal--and I admit, my own nostalgic tolerance for the time it was made--elevate ""SATSG"" to an ""All Time Top Ten"" status selection for me. This is a movie I see over and over again and never get tired of; I recognize that not many viewers will have all their bells rung as I have, but for no other reason than because I LOVE IT, I enthusiastically award the full five stars to ""SATSG"".

And--important postscript--if nothing else, ""SATSG"" did serve as the primary template/inspiration for a MUCH better, indeed, successful on MULTIPLE levels ""tribute"" movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-with-Love-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down with Love (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;a generation later.  --But that will have to be another review!",1341705600,5,7118,5.6125116713352
454748,5,6302354102,"The movie makes a mockery of elements of American society that are held in high regard by people who are caught up in their causes and beliefs. Psychiatrists and their theories are humorously debunked. The methods, reasonings, and especially the conclusions illustrate the empty value of the field and how the profession is all about their egotistical storytelling.

Then we have the corporate money lovers who will do anything for a buck. In the movie they are also the upper middle class perverts pretending to be upstanding. Tony Curtis is like the school girl cliques who befriend someone just to backstab them later with gossip.

Love and marriage are ridiculed for the ease with which suspicion can wreck a relationship. At the same time the confirmed singles finally wake up to the fact that their lives are incomplete. Its not a coincidence that the movie ""Divorce American Style"" and the TV show ""Love American Style"" followed the movie in time and themes.

Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood displayed a full range of emotions in portraying their characters. Their facial expressions in switching from a line of thinking to the sudden realization that something else was happening in reality was superb.

454753,3,6302354102,"Not sure how the real Helen Gurley Brown felt after this was made.

Her book was intended as an expose of what was quickly becoming the Sexual Revolution. It caused a stir among women, not just in the United States, but everywhere. Brown's experiences were a fresh voice that touched a nerve and would be one of the catalysts for female empowerment.

Yes, the book itself was lightweight - but it did act as a proponent for sexual freedom - an extraordinarily controversial topic for its time, more so since it was published immediately after the closing of the 1950s. Arguing for the exploration of one's sexuality prior to marriage; that the same encouragement given to young men should be done for young women, was a very sensitive topic for the day.

But the film adaptation, at least to me, skirted the controversy entirely. Making the characters and, more importantly the concepts that Gurley Brown was advocating, as nothing more than a series of sophomoric comedic skits.

For moderate laughs I won't say it's worthless. But the film felt gutted and I felt cheated given what I know of the book.

To clarify what I mean by campy - the 'ocean rescue' scene. When Curtis' character is pulled from the cold ocean and asked how he's doing, he replies with the classic turn-the-head-water-hose-shooting-from-the-mouth gag. Something straight out of a Three Stooges short.

The best part of the film is found in the last 30 minutes, when Curtis' various ploys and plots to deflower the reported virgin doctor of sexual relationships, finally unravels.

A couple of serious distractions.

First was the inappropriate choice of Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall as the frazzled neighbors. They seemed really out of place in this 60's romp. Such huge stars taking the place of what should've been a pair of unremarkable character actors, broke the rhythm of the film, becoming a distraction instead of a support for the script's foundation.

The second aspect was the absolutely horrid score during the chase scene. It's like an electronic jack hammer. Relentlessly brutal to the film, destroying the comedic energy which took so long to achieve.

Still, all things considered, everything is forgivable when you get to watch the stunning Natalie Wood in a sheer nightgown. Yahoo!

This is a typical 1960's movie that attempts to shock you with sex and craziness.  I was mildly amused by the plot until about halfway through and then I was just bored.  A long and drawn out car chase occurs near the end of the movie and it turned the movie into pure silly dribble.  I enjoyed looking at a few of the sets, decor, and wardrobe as there were some inspiring pieces, but I don't think it's worth watching the movie just to see that.",1279497600,2,703,4.343511450381679
454814,5,6302354102,"This is an example of a delightful comedy that hearkens back to a time when the world seemed much more innocent than it is today. The book takes its title from the Helen Gurley Brown opus of the same name. In typical sixties fashion, there is nothing sexually lurid  suggested in the movie. The movie teases rather than gratuitously depicts, suggests but does not lay bare, beckons its viewers but does not slam the door behind them.
  The stars shine equally brightly in this one. Tony Curtis, ever suave and sophisticated, tempers his delivery with all the coyness of the office boy's slap. Natalie Wood, breathtakingly beautiful and all so sincere, acts as the perfect foil to Curtis. She is so innocent you cannot help but want to believe everything that she says. When she bats her eyes and pleads for forgiveness you know that both Curtis and the viewer cannot help but cave in to her.
  The other principles are universally charming. Edward Everett Horton,  Lauren Bacall, along with Mel Ferrer are all three the epitome of sixties cosmopolitan. The major surprise, though, is Henry Fonda. His deadpan delivery is right on, and he steals every scene he's in.
  Sure, it's mostly a light confection, but this tasty treat goes down easily. There are even a few (dare I say it?)brilliantly staged scenes. For example, when Curtis is in the process of being interviewed by Wood, he needs to fabricate a description of his sex life as he goes along during the questioning. He does so quite skillfully,  incorporating the various psychological states depicted by the artful renderings framed on the office walls, enabling him to finally state the nature of his problem and the reason for his visit. He's ashamed that he's ""sexually inadequate"". Natalie rejoices after Tony's admission, she knows she can help him with THAT problem!
  The viewer of this movie is reminded that laughs do not necessarily have to be generated by obscenity or slapstick. There is an ever present gentle humor running throughout the movie that enlists witty dialogue and clever stagings.  The movies is extremely sixties in its look, and the sixties never looked so good as they do in this film!",1277942400,6,2174,4.861788617886178

Once the car chase begins, things get a little more interesting, but not much.  It starts off funny but gets silly and predicatable.  The best part is when all the actors get on an American Airlines plane to Fiji- American never flew there.

Even the cartoon on the DVD stinks.

However, if you like to look at Natalie Wood at her sexiest, a little of Leslie Parrish- who I think never got a real chance, and Fran Jeffries, then the movie won't be a total waste of time.

That's the idea that propells Stop Magazine's star writer Bob Weston (Tony Curtis) to pen an explosive article that could tear Helen's professional reputation to shreds.

Disguising himself as his neighbour, stocking manufacturer Frank Broderick (Henry Fonda), Bob pours out his heart and soul to sex therapist Helen (Natalie Wood), who concludes that ""Frank"" feels imasculated by domineering wife Sylvia (Lauren Bacall) and in turn sees her as a father figure.  Pretty soon the sparks begin to fly, and demure Helen starts falling for her sympathetic client...

Arguably Natalie Wood's most adorable and accomplished comedy performance, SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL is a candy-coloured romp with some of the most talented stars from the period.  Lauren Bacall is delicious as the snide Sylvia with most of the choice one-liners.  Singing star Fran Jeffries (who later married director Richard Quine) plays Bob's girlfriend and has no less than three great numbers with the swinging Count Basie orchestra.  Also keep an eye out for lovely Leslie Parrish in a small but showy role as Bob's secretary.  1930s screwball character actor Edward Everett Horton is the editor of Stop Magazine and has some great scenes with Curtis.

Author of the best-selling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-The-Single-Girl/dp/1569802521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and The Single Girl</a>, Brown is not at all the clench-jawed celebrity author who wrote the real book and appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" constantly. Instead, she is a gorgeous, intellectually prodigious 23-year-old who extols female empowerment in the bedroom. Showing off his moral depravity, Weston steals the marital woes of her next-door neighbors, pantyhose magnate Frank Broderick and his acerbic wife Sylvia, and comes to see Dr. Brown as a patient. The rest is predictable but still a good amount of fun. Curtis was still at the top of his game here showing how he can easily elicit laughs from such a vile manipulator, but it's Wood who surprises as Brown. Displaying a nervous but infectious energy that feeds nicely into the two sides of the doctor, she is funny and sexy in a way that she could never quite balance as well again in her career. Witness the hilariously conflicted drunken scene in her apartment for evidence of her talent.

Quine was smart to cast three sharp stars in the key supporting roles - Henry Fonda as the put-upon Frank browbeaten into a sad man by Lauren Bacall pulling all the stops as the shrewish basket case Sylvia is, and Mel Ferrer as Brown's somewhat ambiguous colleague.

This film's director, Richard Quine, switched to directing after starring in the film of a lifetime, ""We've Never Been Licked,"" a 1943 movie about the incomparable fighting sons of Texas A&M.  Quine played the lead, a cadet named Brad Craig, and shared the screen with notables Robert Mitchum, Anne Gwynne, Noah Beery Jr and William Frawley.

454879,3,6302354102,"Now get this one. In the early 1960s, Helen Gurley Brown wrote a decidedly controversial book on changing sexual mores among young American women. Hollywood bought the rights, threw out the entire book, and then tacked the title onto an extremely sexist little comedy... and then had the gall to name the leading ingenue after the book's author. Can you imagine? Helen is probably still trying to live it down all these many years later.
The story is ridiculous in the extreme. In general, it concerns writer Bob Weston (Tony Curtis), who goes into therapy with controversial Dr. Helen Gurley Brown (Natalie Wood) in order to get a scoop for his magazine; in the meantime, his best friend (Henry Fonda) is in women's undwear sales, and HIS wife (Lauren Bacall) has become a jealous shrew, convinced that her husband is fooling around with every underwear model he meets. So... Does Dr. Brown practice what she preaches? Of course not; she's a good girl who only writes like a tramp, she falls in love with Bob, and she eventually reigns him in via shedding many manipulative tears--and then they help patch up Bob's best friends' stormy marriage to boot, so everything ends happily ever after.
Frankly, it was films like this that earned Natalie Wood the reputation for being one of the worst actresses in film. But that is actually unfair: Wood, Curtis, Bacall, and Fonda are actually quite good here, and each couple has considerable chemistry. What they DON'T have is a good film--but the blatant sexism of SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL is in such outrageously bad taste that you'll probably sit open-mouthed before it all the way to the bitter end. Worth watching just for the culture shock, but remember that you won't win any friends unless you present this flick as a wildly tacky cultural artifact--which is precisely what it is!
