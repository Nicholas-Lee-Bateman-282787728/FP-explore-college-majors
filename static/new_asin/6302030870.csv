7821645,4,6302030870,"This was a television movie produced by ABC around 1972. It is about  a boy and his grandfather running away because the authorities believe the boy would be better off somewhere else.  It's a loving movie that left a lasting impression.  The theme song ""What Would They Say"", written by Paul Williams touched the hearts of many.  The song was used again for another movie in 1976.",1463097600,,381,4.641791044776119
7821646,1,6302030870,"TITLE: NO PLACE TO RUN opened in theaters in the United States on September 19 1972. The movie took 73 minutes to watch. The movie starred Herschel Bernardi as Hyam Malsh, Stefanie Powers as Bonnie Howard and Larry Hagman as Jay Fox.

SUMMARY: The opens with Hyam getting a physical by his doctor when he is told that he needs to slow down. Later Hyam grandson Remus is shown closing the store and running home to check the mail. Remus finds what he's looking for and runs back to the store. Going on next to, the store is a construction site that the owner of the site wants to buy Hyam out and he won't sell. Later Hyam lawyer Jay fox is sitting in an office talking to Bonnie Howard about Hyam and Remus. Fox doesn't like what he hears so he leaves the office upset. Later Fox goes to see Hyam and tells Hyam what Bonnie Howard told him. Later Hyam sells the business and buys a car so him and Remus can leave and travel.

QUESTIONS: What was in the mail that Remus was hiding? What was being built next to Hyam store? Why was Jay Fox sitting in Bonnie Howard's office? What did Bonnie Howard tell Jay Fox? What was Fox upset about? Why did Hyan sell the store? Why were Hyam and Remus ready to travel? Where were the two going to travel?

MY THOUGHTS: Again this was one of those movies that to me unlike the other preview was not a tear jerker but very boring. There was no action in this movie. To me the story was very over rated. There was no action or drama that kept you interested in this movie. Stefanie Power was misused in movie here beauty and talent was wasted. Only because I can't give this movie 0 weasel stars I give it 1 weasel star and that was beginning nice.",1389484800,,1682,4.217391304347826
