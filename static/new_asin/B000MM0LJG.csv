I am proud to own this DVD.  If you are already a LH fan, I don't need to explain.
If they are new to you, hold on and take a ride. The whole band meshes to the point that they no longer rehearse, unless it's something brand new.
If it is an older cut, they are constantly changing it around, adding a guitar riff where it wasn't before, changing up the drums.  Basically having a blast with the show and their music.
I have liked this band for a long time.  The DVD is great as you get more insight into the people behind the band.
I hope you all go far, as far as you can. You have to get out of the Chicago scene and share a bit :)",1189209600,,668,3.8970588235294117
8169918,5,B000MM0LJG,"WOW, great DVD. I was so excited to receive it. I have seen them live and this is great to pop in and watch when the LH withdrawl starts to set in.

This is a must get for anyone who enjoys a great rock'n roll show..",1171929600,,216,3.6956521739130435
8169919,5,B000MM0LJG,What can I say but this is one of the best bands live and this video captures that live/raw energy and talent!  The walk down memory lane was great and you got to see their personality and love for what they do!  These are four great musicians who have had their ups and downs but have shown why they are still here to rock and give it their all for their fans! ROCK ON!,1171929600,,370,3.9864864864864864
8169920,5,B000MM0LJG,"Seeing Lovehammers live is amazing and this DVD captures much of that minus the hours waiting in line for the show. Among my favorites are ""Faded Grey"" and the acoustic version of ""Clouds."" Lovehammers are Marty Casey (vox), Billy Sawilchik (guitar), Dino Kourelis (bass), and Bobby Kourelis (drums). ""...And the rest is history"" takes you backstage with Lovehammers and you get to see some of their old haunts. But, best of all is the music. Check it out today.",1171929600,,462,4.860759493670886
8169921,4,B000MM0LJG,"Amazing footage on and off stage with RockStar: INXS' runner-up

MARTY CASEY & LOVEHAMMERS. This band has something no one

else in the business can measure up to; besides extreme talent,

they posses a chemistry that cannot be denied! In an industry filled

with one hit wonders... these guys have more songs under their belt

(perhaps why Marty wears two ;-)  LOVEHAMMERS have a fan base

like no other... So, don't miss out viewing history in the making!!",1170201600,2,458,4.794871794871795
8169922,5,B000MM0LJG,"This DVD is awesome. It shows the band live at the Metro in Chicago. If you have never seen them live, it is the next best thing. Their live shows are electric. There is also some stuff inbetween songs about where they grew up and places they would go to --pretty fun. I recommend this DVD for all.",1169337600,3,298,4.155172413793103
