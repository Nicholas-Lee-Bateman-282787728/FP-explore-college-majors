6928708,3,B00RDEIVP2,"I bought it for my wife who enjoyed the series when she was younger. Picture quality is typical of other series of the era. Her issue with it was content. Extensive use of flashbacks, and just still pictures irked her into feeling like it was just a cash grab on the studio's part, but it is what it is",1461542400,3,302,4.135593220338983

6928711,4,B00RDEIVP2,"I accidentally ordered the wrong item, but found myself keeping the DVD anyways. I'm a big time anime fan, and this was a series I fondly remembered watching. Each of the movies were unique continuations of the series itself and threw in some rather interesting plots in terms of side stories and further explanations to the armors. I would recommend this for anyone who has already followed the series, and to no pass up on this gem.",1454284800,6,434,4.64935064935065
