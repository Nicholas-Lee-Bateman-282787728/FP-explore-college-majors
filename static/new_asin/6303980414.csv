743872,5,6303980414,"Admittedly, the film tries so hard to lead you in a direction opposite the final plot twist that some things don't quite hold water.  However, in all other respects the film is such a delight it's easy to forgive a few inconsistencies.  We loved it so much we were about to buy a region 2 copy and a code-free DVD player when we discovered a region 1 version had been released.  As others have already said, the scenery is beautiful, the acting is outstanding, especially Mia Farrow and Joan Plowright who hits exactly the right note as the queen bee of her little matriarchal society.

This film puts to shame all the heavily hyped Hollywood darlings like Sideways and The Aviator.  We've recommended it to a lot of friends and to date, they've all loved it.

We did find the heavy Irish/English accents a little hard to understand at times.  I was forced to turn on the captioning to catch it all.  In almost every respect this movie is a treat!",1120348800,18,947,4.497076023391813
743873,5,6303980414,"This excellent comedic mystery takes a dig at the social hypocrisy permeating small town life in 1920s Ireland. Into their prim and proper society, a mystery, a scandal and even a murder descends. In the little lakeside town of Kilshannon, a group of widows lord it over the townsfolk. Led by Mrs. Counihan (Joan Plowright), they hold themselves apart from the town's men and others of lesser ilk. Their life is turned upside down with the arrival of a young English widow (Natasha Richardson) who instantly ensnares the Matriach's only son. But one of the clique, Miss O'Hare (Mia Farrow) holds an instant dislike to the new arrival. What lies behind the mysterious animosity between the two. What hold does the penniless, tart-tongued Miss O'Hare have over the rest of the widows? Will their mutual antipathy lead to murder? As an oh-so-genteel, parlour mystery it works deliciously. Savour the final twist at the end.

This DVD release from New Line Entertainment is one of the most beautiful transfers I've seen in a long while. The original photography of the Irish countryside, resplendant in greens and blues is exquisitely rendered in this transfer. Colors are gorgeously rich and natural. Black levels are perfect. The level of fine detail is revelatory. It's a joy just to watch the scenery unfold onscreen. It is presented in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Soundwise we are given a choice of 5.1 DTS, Dolby 5.1, and the original Dolby Stereo. All in, an absolutely admirable release from New Line. Definitely worth the asking price.",1114300800,56,1589,5.018939393939394

copy and the digital transfer is outstanding.  Mia Farrow, Joan

Plowright and Natasha Richardson are delightful in this film of

a small Irish village run by the widows.  Richardson is the mysterious newcomer whose arrival opens many cans of worms.  I liked all the little bits that are part of the movie like being

suspicious of ""foreigners"" and the gossipy women.  Jim Broadbent

and Adrian Dunbar contribute to the festivities.  Definitely for

the ENCHANTED APRIL  crowd of which I am a charter member.",1109894400,14,574,4.73469387755102

 That and the fact that this is a cast you just can't assemble these days! Excelllence all around. Acting. Screenplay. Directing. Just get it! Or if you don't get it, you really don't ""get it.""

743876,5,6303980414,"This is a top rate murder-comedy that more movies should be like.  Think of the movie ""Clue"" only in Ireland.
OK... so the main performers are mostly English with an American thrown in for good measure -- still, it's set in Ireland with many talented Irish actors involved and the humor is as Irish as it gets!  (""Back that at 8 to 1, ya bollix."")  Each non-Irish actor is thoroughly convincing though and I had no clue that Natasha Richardson wasn't born in America her accent is that good!
The movie itself is set in Ireland with all the beautiful rolling hills, quaint towns (Inistioge?  Help me out, people...) and scenic lakes that country has to offer.  I can watch this movie over and over for the background alone - and often do.  The twist had the end is one you'll never see coming which makes the movie that much the better.
If you love great acting, Ireland, mystery and a good laugh then watch this film.  And be sure to bug New Line Studios for a DVD version!!",1041984000,101,974,4.407821229050279
743877,5,6303980414,"Widow's Peak continues to stand out as one of the most delicately charming, and above all, funny movies of the last twenty years.  This well-told tale thoroughly transports you to an Irish hamlet dominated by landowning widows (headed by the ever-quirky Joan Plowright) and concerns the town secret - why the snobbish women have taken poor-as-Job Mia Farrow under their wing, and the arrival of mysterious young widow Natasha Richarson to stir things up.  Delightful characterizations and turns of the phrase will make you chuckle throughout and leave you smiling for days.  With Jim Broadbent.",1008892800,25,594,5.231578947368421
743878,5,6303980414,"Joan Plowright is the matriarchal ruler of an Irish village just after WWI that is populated by war widows. Plowright's character keeps a tight reign on the inhabitants of the village by her sharp tongue, potential character  assassignations (reputations), and telescopic spying from her Victorian  home set atop the highest point of the village. Mia Farrow is a  ""pitiful"" middle-aged never-married, who has a secret and is kept  in despair by Plowright. The village dentist would like to  ""truly"" court Ms. Farrow, but that is frowned on by Plowright. In  the midst of this peculiar village, Natasha Richardon arrives. Wealthy,  beautiful, and stylish, she takes possession of a large, beautiful cottage  and drives her auto around the town, causing quite a stir among the  villagers. Mia Farrow is convinced that Richardson is evil and sets about  trying to expose her, while Plowight's grandam takes a liking to Richardson  and attempts to squash Farrow. The story, which is hilarious from the  opening scene, really starts flying at this point. Escapades of spying  intensify. Accusations result in sinister developments, and Plowright  charges ahead to ""punish"" wrongdoers with her mighty pen and  loud, opinioned mouth. The hysteria of the village had me laughing and out  of breath from beginning to end. What a fun romp with an old battle axe!",960681600,4,1352,5.161290322580645
743879,5,6303980414,"""Widow's Peak"" is one of the few films I have ever seen that I would characterize as flawless.  The performances of Joan Plowright, Mia Farrow and Natasha Richardson are first rate.  The story keeps you laughing  despite the obviously sinister plot.  The scenery is wonderful.  Richardson  does an excellent job as a villainess you love to hate.  Farrow has never  been better than in this role as the mousey and mad Mrs. O'Hare, who (a la  Cassandra)no one believes when she talks about the sinister nature of the  newly arrived widow.  Plowright is perfect as the know-it-all grandam of  the small Irish town of Kilshannon.  And through it all, right along with  Ms. O'Hare you know exactly what is going on--or do you?  This quaint and  well-crafted tale has a surprise ending that, in a non-supernatural way, is  just as startling as that in ""Sixth Sense"".  I laughed out loud  when I realized how thorougly I had been ""had"" all the way  through the film.  John Irvin is to be highly commended for the way he  guided the cast thorugh this superb creation without giving away the real  nature of the mischief afoot until the very end of the film.  A must-see  for any mystery film fans, especially fans of mysteries in the UK.",958953600,24,1229,4.630841121495327

This was especially true in ""Widow's Peak"" where as the sexy stranger Edwina Natasha Richardson stops you dead in your tracks. The movie itself is firm proof you can make an intricate plot entertaining. I read a while back that ""Widow's Peak"" was a project a then young Mia Farrow had wanted to film with her actress mother Maureen O'Sullivan. That dream never was fulfilled, but Miss Farrow was able to bring an aspect of it to life. I love the scenes she shares with the great Jim Broadbent as Clancy the town dentist. This was around the starting point of Mr. Broadbent getting recognition from American audiences along with his role in ""Enchanted April."" Although not playing the pleasantest of people Joan Plowright is marvelous as the town's richest widow. But most of all, ""Widow's Peak"" is how I like to remember the beautiful Natasha Richardson.

Apparently the movie was written for television, but I never suspected that while watching it and only learned of its origins while reading online reviews. The movie paints a lush picture of charming village life in 1920s Ireland. The costumes and cinematography are beautiful, the screenplay is driven by  dialogue and character, and the cast is excellent.

The quaint village of Kilshannon is unofficially ruled by a bevy of wealthy widows led by Mrs. Doyle-Coonan (Joan Plowright), who believe they represent the town's moral high ground. Mrs. Doyle-Coonan, a benevolent dictator, spends much of her time keeping a watchful eye on village manners and morals through the lens of her brass telescope. Among those whom she monitors is Widow O'Hare (Mia Farrow), a relative newcomer who, in addition to growing prize roses, has attracted the amorous attentions of the village dentist (Jim Broadbent).

One day, village life is suddenly turned upside down with the arrival of a young and glamorous new widow, Mrs. Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson), who not only sets her cap for the doyenne's pampered son but is soon at loggerheads with the Widow O'Hare. Not only does Edwina upset the reigning matriarchal hierarchy, but her unexplained feud with Miss O'Hare casts a sinister shroud of mystery over the insular community. Scandalous revelations ensue, leading to a mysterious disappearance suggestive of murder, and culminating in a surprise ending. A very enjoyable twisted tale. This film should appeal to those who enjoyed Enchanted April, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont, and Ladies in Lavender.",1330473600,6,1701,5.2463235294117645

When I settled in to watch it, the first few minutes of the film was very confusing and took quite a while into the film to figure out the characters and what was going on.  Also Natasha Richardson was playing an American and so wasn't speaking in her beautiful accent that makes her voice so smooth and silky and unique, which was a great disappointment.  I think her character would have been better served using her British accent. The full premise of the movie did not become clear until approximately 1/2 way through the movie and even then it seemed very campy and strange.  This movie just didn't flow like it should.  It did get interesting toward the end when you figured out what was going on and there was an unexpected twist at the end.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie, as it is a great disappointment and in my opinion just a strange and confusing movie story, although there was some great acting going on by the actors.

Named for an Irish village in which numerous widows have congregated, the town is turned upside down when a pretty young widow arrives, setting off a feud with the middle aged Miss O'Hare. Most of the film centers upon the growing conflict between the two, each of whom is fostering a romance with a local swain. It soon becomes apparent who is really running this community, and it isn't the mayor! When Miss O'Hare disappears, the indomitable Mrs. Counihan accuses the obvious suspect. The denouement comes in the form of a surprising and satisfying twist.

745350,1,6303980414,"High above a tiny Irish village is ""Widows' Peak,"" an area inhabited by a tight-knit group of well-off widows.  The doyen of the group is the venerable Mrs. Doyle-Counihan (Joan Plowright), who keeps the ladies in her circle on a short leash.  An odd member of their society is Miss O'Hare (Mia Farrow), the only unmarried lady to be accepted as an intimate.  When a  flamboyant, young American woman (Natasha Richardson) moves in, she shakes up the town by quickly stealing the heart of Mrs. Doyle-Counihan's son and for no apparent reason, making a enemy of Miss O'Hare.

Billed as a comedy/mystery/thriller, this very odd movie falls short on all counts.  While it does paint a charming picture of Irish village life in the 1920s, both the plot and the local dialect are nearly incomprehensible and the ending is too much of a twist.  Plowright (widow of Laurence Olivier) is wonderful as the  foolish grande dame who thinks she knows everything.  Farrow, however, is woefully miscast.  Her Irish accent comes and goes and she looks like a spaced-out twenty-something, which hurts the ending.  Richardson is simply annoying as the pushy and mysterious American.  None of the characters, in fact, are likeable in the least and I didn't care about any of them - with the exception of the local dentist, played to comic perfection by Jim Broadbent.

We did not realize until later that Natasha Richardson was the one who died in a skiing accident in Canada or that she was the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and the wife of Liam Neeson. She was the one who brought sparkle to the story as she portrayed a mysterious newcomer to the community who impacted everyone with not only her beauty, but her daring and enthusiastic joy of life.

The movie creates an ambience that is unusual to say the least; unlike many contemporary American movies this one gets off to a slow and methodical start as the Irish community of Counihan is progressively displayed to the viewer. The significance of ""Widow's Peak"" is revealed and the power structure that drives the community.

Into this well ordered and predictable lifestyle enters a mysterious beauty with an agenda. The fact that the agenda exists is only revealed gradually as the groundwork is laid for the surprise ending.

Mr. Doug Thomas states in the Editorial Review, ""What starts off as an accessible film turns into a prize only for those who liked Enchanted April and similar movies."" I'll confess that my wife and I are great fans of ""Enchanted April"" and ""similar movies"" so we did find this movie a prize. We invite friends over to watch movies every month and have already decided that this one is next on the list.

Since Mr. Thomas brought it up, I'll add that ""Enchanted April"" is one you should also consider if you don't already have it. We have a LaserDisc version several years old and have recently added the DVD version to our collection. Two of the actors in this film are also in ""Enchanted April,"" Joan Plowright and Jim Broadbent, the dentist.

First off, if you enjoy a dialogue and character driven screenplay,WIDOW'S PEAK is exactly that. The wealthy town of Kilshannon,Ireland,1926, is ruled by the matriarchal rich widows who inhabit the wealthy ""high ground"".The twice-bereaved Mrs. Doyle-Coonan (Joan Plowright&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Palfrey-at-the-Claremont/dp/B000GYI3PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont</a>) being their head-mistress,is the ""Queen Mam"" over all of the men and woman and especially over her dutiful beloved son Godfrey.

Something starts very wrongly between these two,and they actually become rather sinister towards each other actually attempting to kill each other.

Okay, I know by saying what I just did I've alienated many potential helpful voters among those most thoroughly Irish-American stripe who adored this estrogen-heavy production, so let me play it straight from here on out and tell you that Widow's Peak is a charismatic little mystery that's definitely better than most of what gets made nowadays on either side of the Atlantic. It is about one Edwina Broome, (played by Natasha Richardson) a glamorous young woman from ""the outside"" who in the late 1920's rents a cottage and comes to stay in a small Irish town dominated by a clique of middle-aged widows headed by the patrician Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, portrayed to a T by the great Joan Plowright. Edwina soon sets the teeth of these dominant widows on edge with her modernity and flirtatiousness, as well as her mysterious past, plus what's worse she easily infatuates Godfrey, pampered son of an appalled Mrs. Doyle-Counihan. A clash of wills ensues, Edwina is rapidly at odds with the prim and severe Miss O'Hare (none other than Mia Farrow) who devotes herself to both uncovering the real reason Edwina has come to town, and to wrecking Edwina's chances of social advancement within the community. The film peaks (no pun intended...no, honestly) with scandalous revelations about Edwina's recent deeds, and with a disappearance that surely must be the result of murder most foul. In the end the story delivers up its secrets amid a heaping helping of good old-fashioned justice-cum-revenge. Widow's Peak makes excellent use of its Irish setting and cast and nails quite well the insular nature of small town life in generations' past.

Mia Farrow is perfect for the part. Joan Plowright is always a winner and well cast. Pick this movie up for a relaxing evening at Widow's Peak Ireland",1167782400,2,318,4.8
745567,5,6303980414,"I'm not usually one for this type of thing, but lately I've been getting into the genre.  You know the ""Enchanted April,"" types and other films, even though I'm a guy. Call me crazy, but there's some good stuff here.

These are not ""romance"" movies as much as just plain good films with some great plot twists.  Trouble is, it's hard to go into detail about WHY this film is great without giving away some spoilers.  Suffice it to say that all the performances in this are superb---Plowright is at the top of her game, as is Farrow, and the others fit in to a ""T.""

The photography of this is beautiful, with a detail to colors like you might see in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" or even some ""art"" films. But the best thing is the plot. Why this wasn't better received when it came out over a decade ago, I do not know.  Just a great, great film.",1158278400,8,846,4.22360248447205
745568,4,6303980414,"This was a wonderful little film, with much the same feel and flavor of ""Hear My Song"", and also the same actor, Adrian Dunbar.  Of course, the plot and scenery were different, but still, it had that same ""feel good"" impression at the end.  Hard to believe that Mia Farrow is 49 years old here.  She sure looks terrific.  And I love anything Joan Plowright (Lawrence Olivier's widow) is in; she's just marvelous.  Set in 1926, the costumes are exquisite.  I had guessed the outcome of the mystery, but that made it no less enjoyable.  I have seen the guy who played the dentist before, just can't remember where.  There were lots of wonderful comic lives that made you laugh out loud; such as England exists just as a place for the Irish to send their unwed mothers (this was set in Ireland).  The plot twist was a good one, but Natasha Richardson (late of ""The White Countess"") overplayed her part a tad too much; otherwise, I might not have guessed it.  It was set in a time and place and way of life we'll never see again, a quieter time, a lovely time.  We have speeded up our world too much.  And you could see it coming here, as Plowright's car speeds along, knocking people down, in the opening scene.",1146441600,6,1208,4.416289592760181
745569,5,6303980414,"If there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it!  Mrs. O'Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn't trust Edwina, the new beauty that's come to town.  The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end.  Or does she?  If I said any more, I'd be spoiling the story.  Just watch this movie, and enjoy.  Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for!",1144540800,4,452,4.321428571428571

7857524,5,6303980414,"Oh what FUN!!! A marvelous story line where I was so sure I was on to the twist ending...and it twisted away from me delightfully! I haven't enjoyed a period film of this kind for so long, perfection in casting - Joan Plowright, Richardson in her dazzling youth, and a reminder that Mia Farrow, both before and after Woody, was a helluva an actress. It was a delight to see a young Jim Broadbent just beginning his stunning rise in serious casting in the British film canon, and Adrian Dunbar was marvelous, we don't see enough of him in film as we once did. On location shooting, rich cinematography, teasing with what seem to be stock cozy mystery characters but no one gets away without skewering. Perfection from start to end. Enjoy!",1520294400,,737,4.590909090909091
7857525,1,6303980414,Mia Farrow? Really? Were there not enough talented women in England to cast? Five minutes was all I could take of her ridiculous accent.,1515456000,,136,4.708333333333333
