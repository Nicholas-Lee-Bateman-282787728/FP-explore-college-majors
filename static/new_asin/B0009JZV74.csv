8062189,5,B0009JZV74,I own this on DVD and have attended Bryan Bilinski's shooting school. The video details very well what Bryan teaches and why. Bryan's school helped my shooting immensely and watching this video presentation both before and after the school has been very valuable. It prepared me for what to expect beforehand and reinforced what I'd learned afterward. Strict attention to the fundamentals presented here  have made me a much better shooter.,1494115200,,440,5.197183098591549
8062190,2,B0009JZV74,Tom Huggler is awful and should just get out of the way and let Bryan Bilinski talk.  Man is he irritating.,1417392000,,107,4.095238095238095
