What an amazing tribute not just to the wonderful Daniel Barenboim but also to the militant hopefulness of youth, of young people who haven't yet decided that ""this is the way things are"" and who still want and intend to live a happier life.  The fascinating journey of discovery and friendship in the midst of conflict, and of seeing inherited hates dissolving, makes one wonder if we could just replace our adult legislative bodies with youth assemblies we would find roads to peace.  Don't skip the second disc either, The Ramallah Concert.  You've heard all the music before but you have never seen a clearer demonstration of the healing power of music for an audience in a place that could be forgiven for being wary.  What makes the concert so memorable is the thrilling reaction of the Ramallah audience, and the wonderful gesture of Maestro Barenboim making the effort pick his way through the orchestra to shake the hand of each player as the thunderous applause continued.  Don't stream it.  Have it to keep, cherish and share.",1464393600,,1174,4.810945273631841
