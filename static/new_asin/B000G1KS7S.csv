8128424,5,B000G1KS7S,"Sometimes it takes a while for the really important art of any given era to gain the recognition it deserves. This may be especially true of the period after 9/11, when political opportunism, foreign wars and the historical proximity of the attacks turned Ground Zero into one of the most appropriated and ideologically charged spaces in modern American history. Peter Josyph's Liberty Street, a book and an independently financed and produced documentary film, may have been missed by many first time around. Ten years on from the attacks, both book and film should be automatic inclusions in any canons of key 9/11 art.
 Josyph has important things to say about ordinary New Yorkers' experience of the attacks and their treatment during the recovery effort. With economy, elegance and anger, Liberty Street traces the abandonment of local communities abutting Ground Zero by federal, state and city agencies, even as the site was sanctified as a totem of populist, democratic values. Josyph also has significant things to say about the difficulties--and meanings--of making art at Ground Zero, particularly visual art, in a climate when simply pointing a camera at the perimeter wall exposed ordinary citizens to arrest and detention under directives Josyph describes as authoritarian and unconstitutional. Liberty Street responds to this erosion of civic experience with a visual and prose poetry that subverts these tendencies, drawing on influences that include Whitman, Thoreau, Ginsberg, Burroughs and Godard.
 Book and film do these things in different ways. Each needs the other to nourish, complement and explicate its own representation of the site and the richly drawn characters who bring it alive and inscribe it with meaning. Collectively, Josyph's Liberty Streets offer an artistic vision which is unique among contemporary interrogations of Ground Zero, but which also embodies deeply rooted traditions of US culture that enjoyed significant revivals after 9/11--notably those of ""civic"", ""public"" or ""democratic"" art.",1310083200,,2035,5.498402555910543
8128425,5,B000G1KS7S,"DDT is one of the top two or three rock bands in Russia. Here's a chance to find out why! This video does a great job of giving the feel for DDT in concert. They are an incredible Russian band, led by visionary songwriter/singer Yuri Shevchuk.

They rarely perform in the U.S., so this is real opportunity to see and hear their energetic rock. DDT has a great sound: true rock, but with a Russian twist. Also included are several bonus music videos, revealing intriguing imagery, making the lyrics more accessible (since there are no subtitles).

One caveat: You have to be able to play PAL formatted videos in order to play this video.",1301961600,,636,4.5701754385964914
8128426,5,B000G1KS7S,"I wanted to take time to write a review of this movie because, after seeing it at the Pioneer Theater in January 2006, I wanted a copy. I finally own one and I plan to see it again and again. It is difficult to characterize how and why this film is unique based on the fact that so much has been written about this time of great tragedy. Trust me, it is.

I'll do my best to explain. Mr. Josyph paints a picture of a catastrophe at the same time that he creates his personal view. It may be a clich that by focusing on an array of people touched by this tragedy, he paints a picture of the humanity in us all. These strangers became friends, not only for him, but for me as I view this DVD in the security of my home. He furthers my understanding not only through the people he meets, but through the objects he discovers along the way. It's easy to explain how  people can suggest the complexity of the time. But how can a ruined barber pole that continued to tick even though it was blown to bits be etched in my mind and provide an appreciation of the heartbreak and the glory of what it is to be human? I could say that Donavin, a carpenter who worked to rebuild a personal and, at the same time, a professional devastation, is for the first time joyous. I hear him saying, ""It takes a lickin, but it keeps on tickin!"" and I realize this life force is a main ingredient of the film.

Is this film about a barber pole on Liberty Street? No. The sequence lasted for only a few minutes. It was one fragment of Josyph's `walk' through the neighborhood. As I understand from reading his book LIBERTY STREET: ENCOUNTERS AT GROUND ZERO, he had no real object in mind as he began his walk just weeks after the attacks. He was compelled to go to the site with his camera. It seemed that his camera walked him. It is as much a participant. Surely he did not decide to include Barthman's Clock or a blown apart barber pole, and yet they support a unique appreciation of what we describe as 9/11. Is LIBERTY STREET a documentary? Yes, but more than that it is a work of art. Can I tell you why? No. That's why I urge those who read this to purchase what I consider to be a masterpiece. LIBERTY STREET is not a presentation of ideas: it is a view of Lower Manhattan and its people in a time of great crisis and recovery, a view of New York, and of America, as never before seen. It is visually beautiful. It is rare that we can hear, see, taste and touch historic moments through film. The humanity of Josyph and all he encountered is grounded through intelligent artistic sensitivity that in the end is greater than the sum of its parts.

I await your reviews.",1296432000,,2652,4.214566929133858
8128427,5,B000G1KS7S,"I saw this film at a documentary film festival in Wales, Great Britain. Instead of portentous verbal overlays and musical accompaniment, Joseph lets the agonizing process of cleaning up the Ground Zero site, the sounds of its machinery, tumbling piles of masonry and metal, and the voices of those workers immured in the ruins of the two great towers in the well of sadness left in their wake tell the story unadorned. The visual images are spectacular as well as horrifying. It's almost like a medical documentary: you see a great city in the process of cauterizing its worst wound and beginning a long healing process. This is not an ""entertainment"" in the classic sense, any more than a long, complex poem like ""Leaves of Grass"" would be; it's an extended meditation in sights and sounds, and you will need to set a couple of hours aside, preferably undistracted, to do justice to its richness and gravity. A stunning accomplishment.",1294790400,,936,4.85625
8128428,5,B000G1KS7S,"I have seen this documentary at the Pioneer Theater and at a film festival in Brooklyn. It is by far the best film dealing with the subject of 9/11. It is so beautifully shot with great interviews, great music; its stunning and emotional. It makes me proud to be a New Yorker.",1294790400,,276,4.326923076923077
