2193973,5,B0006SSNXW,"Seeveral Sources claim that Orton will challenge HHH for the Woirld Title at Wrestlemania 21. Now either someone wins the chamber only to lose it to HHH at the royal rumble or on RAW or HHH wins the chamber either way it sucks!!!!Anyway here are my predictions for the Card:-

World Heavyweight Championship Match

Triple H(c) Vs. Randy Orton

It would be good if they hyped it like this:Former Freinds face each other. Just one on One. HHH and Orton. No Interference. To Prove who is the better man in the main event of the biggest event of all time.................should be a great main event despite HHH being in the main event for the 3 year in a row!

WWE Championship Match

John Bradshaw Layfield (c) Vs. John Cena

Now i would like this if it happened because it is a fresh face challenging for the title. They could use Orlando taking the US Belt of Cena to build up the tension between JBL and Cena by JBl and The Bashams costing Cena the US title.

Grudge Match

Edge Vs. Shawn Michaels

This is a very highly anticapated match and i think that tonight on RAW(27th of December) HBK will confront edge. Should be a good matcn if it happens.

Grudge Match

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Booker T

SD! will really pick up going into WM IMO as Booker and eddie seem to be building up a freinship which we all know will end in Tragedy.

Heidenreich Vs. The Big Show

Dont Know why but i think theyll face each other should be a terrible match if it happens lol

WWE Tag Team Championship Match

Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio Vs. Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak

Its Just a matter of time before Luther and Jindrak take the title but i hope (if the match happens) They won't win.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match

Billy Kidman Vs. Paul London Vs. Chavo Guerrero Vs. Spike Dudley

I can just see this happeing for some reason and oh yeah its elimination format to. Or maybe we'll say a cruiserweight battle royal similar to last year but all in the ring at once and it ends in pinfall:London, Kidman,chavo, nunzio, akio, spike dudley, funaki, Rey Mysterio(in 2 matches),Shannon Moore, Scotty 2 Hotty

US Championship Match

Charlie Haas Vs. Orlando Jordan

Grudge Match

Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match

Shelton benjamin Vs. Batista

Inferno Match

Kane Vs. Snitsky

Face Vs. Face grudge Match Final encounter

Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit

I would love to see them face each other just one last time and it would be great to have it at WM 21",1104105600,,2476,4.546485260770975

2194007,4,B0006SSNXW,"1. Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero: Well this the first time two tag team champions face each other at WrestleMania. I felt this match was a good opener. Having two of Smackdown great stars of that time going at it was a good idea.
2. Chris Jerico vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Edge vs. Kane vs. Chris Benoit Money In The Bank Ladder Match: The first ever money in the bank ladder match in my opinion was one of the best. Being the only hardcore match of the night it really showed some amazing moves things you would not want to miss.
3. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton: This was another good match. This was fought well by both superstars and I'm pretty sure you can guess who wins this one.
4. Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme Women's title: Being the first title match of the night, I felt it was a good match. In other reviews I've read that they felt it wasn't, but that's just my opinion. This match did have a good storyline behind it thou.
5. HBK vs. Kurt Angle: This match was the best match of the night. There were so many near falls and great wrestling it was unbelievable. Ok maybe I was little over boarded on that. But I still give this match 5 stars*****.
6. PIper's Pit: Just for pure entertainment. That's all I got to say about that.
7. Big Show vs. Akebono Sumo Match: What a waste of my time. I mean come on who wants to see to fat guys in speedos go at it. I mean seriously, but that's just my opinion/
8. JBL vs. John Cena WWE title: This match was short for a WWE title match. I still liked the ending thou. It still had some good moves from home much time it was.
9. HHH vs. Batista World Heavyweight title: This match could have been better, but hey what can you do about it. I liked the ending this one as well. It was still short for the main event of WrestleMania. This one also had good wrestling in it to.

Overall: I was being generous and gave it 4**** stars. One reason, is because their was not a lot of hardcore in it. I'm the kind of person who needs a little hardcore in wrestling. Another reason, was there were only three titles on the line. There are over six titles in the WWE at that time and only 3 were on the line. Last reason, is the main events were short and not as good as they should have been. Once again thats my opinion not no one else's.",1371600000,,2296,4.147982062780269

2194010,4,B0006SSNXW,"This was a very fine Wrestlemania with a tone of great matches. This was the first Wrestlemania I ordered on PPV. It was a fun time watching this live with both my uncles who were wrestling fans before I was born. Nearly every match here was fun and I always thought each had the rght people winning. Here's my run down

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero
This was a fine opener. Both men have a ton of back and forth moves that goes in a fast pace. Although I felt this was the begining of their horrible feud that happened later that year (2005). A fun match, but not a show stealer. 7/10

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Edge vs. Kane vs. Chris Benoit vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin(IC) vs. Chris Jericho
Wow! This match was out of control in a good way. All six men give it their all in this match, but it's Shelton Benjamin that steals this match. Watch out for his running up the ladder spot. Chris Benoit also proves why he is one of the best. The right man wins this one too!!! A must watch match!!! 9/10

Hulk Hogan, Eugene and Hassan segment.
Not a whole lot to say about this segment. Eugene comes out to talk about his favorite moment in WM history until Hassen attacks him. Then HULK HOGAN makes a shocking but awesome appearance. The crowd go completely nuts. Maybe the loudest cheer of the night. Worth seeing to Hogan's return.

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton ""Legend vs. Legend Killer""
This was the match I anticipated the most. I was so worried that Undertaker was going to lose his legendary streak. Both men move very fast with a ton of close calls. Undertaker still proves why he is a Legend and Randy Orton shows that he is main event worthy. Look out for the Chokeslam reversed into an RKO spot. That moment had me off my set when I saw it. Randy's father Cowboy Bob Orton makes a quick apperance. 2nd best match of the night! Check it out. 9.5/10

Women's Championship Match: Christy Hemme w/ Lita vs. Trish Stratus(c)
Not much to say about this match. Just an mediocre women's match. I thought Lita would add to this match, but all she did was stare at Trish the whole time. Trish clearly can wrestle better than most of the women in WWE. Not bad, but forgetable. 3/10

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels
In the words of Ron Simmons....DAMN!! This was the match of the night. This was the first time both Angle & HBK ever fought each other and it lived up to it's expectations. It started a tad slow though, but it picks up real quick. HBK does a great table spot on Angle from the top rope without the table breaking! Angle even has a missed sumersault in the ring. A must see match for everyone. 9.25/10

Piper's Pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin
This was merly a fun segment that involved both men taking pot shots at each other. Piper has fun with the ""WHAT"" crowd. Carlito comes down which adds to the segment and makes it funny. Worth a watch because of Austin.

Sumo Match: Akebono vs. Big Show
So many people are so appalled by that segment ""yes a SEGMENT"". I don't know what they were expecting out of it? At least it isn't THE main event. Still, not much to say about it. It's just a silly segment.

WWE Championship match- JBL(C) vs. John Cena
Not a whole lot can be said about this match. I was dissapointed by it though. After all the cheap wins over the year by JBL, he loses really fast to Cena. While I was glad Cena won this match, I expected more from it. I expected JBL's cabnet to run down and try to help JBL win which have made Cena's win more meaningful. Insted, it was JBL dominating the match til the last 5 mins with Cena suddenly gaining the power to win. Not a horrible match, but underwelming. 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship- Triple H(C) vs. Batista
This was a great main event. Not a perfect follow up to the last main event at WM 20 (one of the best in my opinon), but it still comes strong. Triple H comes out with Motorhead playing his song live which is a great sight to see. The match starts a tad slow but picks up. Both men have a good brawl with the crowd heavly behind Batista. Triple H gets a beating like we've never seen (almost). Ric Flair adds to the match by trying to help Triple H out but in vain. The crowd went nuts when Batista broke out of Triple H's pedigree. Batista proves that he is main event worthy. Not the best match, but a great main event nonetheless.  8.25/10

Overall, this was a fun Wrestlemaina. It was worth every dollar spent. The DVD feat.s are also worth a look. It has all the Wrestlemania commericals for that year which spoofs many big movies like Dirty Harry, Braveheart and Taxi Driver. Even video highlights for Undertaker, Kurt Angle and Shawn Micheals.

Alot of people have different types of match liking but its all about the chemistry & story they tell in the ring. Those who had doubted Randy from 2003-2004 truly changed their mind after this match with the deadman. not too many people can have a great match with taker.

Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemme

This match definetly was suppose to be Trish/LIta but overall a valid effort to Hemme

Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels

Match of 2005 and possibly the decade. Enough said

Pipers Pit featuring Stone Cold is a classic

WWE Championship Match

3 out of 5 stars
Everyone knew JBL was going to drop the title to Cena. Cena was molded to main event status at the Rumble 05. Predictible match to say the least. The Era of Cena was begun

World Heavyweight Championship Match
Triple H vs Batista
4 out of 5 stars. Im rating the match on storyline as well hence the 4/5. The climax of evolution and the arrival of the animal was all set in stone at the right place at the right time. Just like Cena, the Era of Batista began after winning the championship.

Overall a classic overlooked underrated WrestleMania. For those who are starting to collect dvds, take time and actually watch this ppv. it is not boring whatsoever. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1294531200,2,1798,4.40785498489426

2194016,4,B0006SSNXW,"The Rey Mysterio-Eddie Guerrero match was pretty good for a opener. The 6 way Money In The Money ladder was high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The match between Randy Orton & The Undertaker was a solid back-and-forth bout. The Trish Stratus-Christy Hemme-Women's title match was short but sweet. The Kurt Angle-HBK match was a back-and-forth,nail-biting,heart-stopping,match of the year. The Sumo match bewteen The Big Show & Akebono was a short,pointless,dumb,IQ insulting trash-heap. The John Cena-JBL-WWE title match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the HHH-Batista-World's title match. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1280534400,,642,5.561224489795919
2194017,5,B0006SSNXW,"WrestleMania 21 featured several matches that certainly superceded the championship Main Events. With Edge (I've never considered him a premier performer, but he generates heat and is easy to hate) winning the first Money in the Bank Match, he ushered in a new match that would be a highlight of subsequent 'Manias. Undertaker worked an entertaining match with a still-green Randy Orton. Mysterio/Guerrero offered a good cruiserweight contest.

But Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle stole the show with a match far better than the Championship matches. It is a shame that Angle moved to TNA. He is a fabulous heel worker who is a superb technician in the ring. Michaels/Angle is a match to be watched more than once, and makes this a worthy purchase. The Movie Parodies were entertaining, and this was the year that Hogan was inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Cena/JBL match...probably a prime example of how fast Cena was pushed, as his work is mechanical and very rough. In the Main Event, Triple H did his best to work around the painfully obvious mistakes Batista made in the ring. Triple H adjusted as well as anyone could, but Batista's strength resulted in some awkward spots for Triple H.

8 events seems to have become a standard for WWE PPVs, and WM21 may have been the event to solidify that pattern. With a Match of the Year on the card, that should persuade buyers to snag a copy, even if it really is just for the Michaels/Angle match.",1266364800,,1447,4.715415019762846
2194018,4,B0006SSNXW,"This was the first WM I watched on DVD. And I liked it! It's pretty good. I love the Hollywood theme cos the mock movie trailers are great. But more about that later.

Let's have a rundown:

The show opened with Lilian Garcia singing ""America The Beautiful."" I'm not American, but Lilian sung the song gorgeously.

Then we get a really cool intro video with Stone Cold Steve Austin starring as a gladiator.

Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero
These two have had many, many matches together and this is yet another good one. Although this one loses some points due to the fact Rey kept adjusting his mask every 10 seconds, and it was slower then other matches they've had. But it was an awesome way to open the show, with a pure wrestling match. (3.5/5)

Here we had a confrontation between JBL (who had Orlando Jordan with him) and Triple H (who was accompanied by Ric Flair), Raw and SD's respective champions. They mocked one another, and said that they'd be champion at the end of the night. This amuses me because ironically neither of them were champion by the end of WM because both John Cena & Batista beat them. I loved Ric's little ""woo!"" to JBL at the end xD

Money In The Bank Match
Edge vs Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Benoit vs Christian (w/ Tyson Tomko) vs Kane
The first MITB match, and one of the best. This is a match full of amazing moments, and every man gets a chance to shine. But I think the real star was Shelton, the man pulled some death-dying moves during the match. I loved how during Kane's entrance the ladders were on fire, and how everybody else attacked him before he even got to the ring. The only downer here was that Edge won when Chris Benoit was so close to the briefcase. But overall, a fantastic match. (4.5/5)

After MITB, Eugene came out to the ring and said how excited he was to be at Wrestlemania, and that his favourite WM moment involved King Kong Bundy & midgets. Muhammed Hassan & Daivari came out to ruin the fun. Hassan yelled at Eugene, asking why he thought he was angry. Eugene amusingly replied ""You don't like midgets!"" which cracked me up. Hassan got mad and said that he didn't like being left out of WM, then he and Daivari attacked Eugene. This brought out Hulk Hogan to the rescue, who disposed of both men. I'm not a fan of Hogan, but it was good to see Hassan & Daivari get beaten up.

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton
This match was pretty good, but started a little slow for me. Randy's Dad, Cowboy Bob Orton makes an appearance but gets beaten up for his troubles. The ending sequence was fantastic, especially when Randy tried to do the Tombstone but Taker reversed it. Good wrestling on display from both men, but ultimately it was 13-0 to Taker at WM. (3.5/5)

WWE Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (champion) vs Christy Hemme (w/ Lita)
The first title match of the night, and frankly, it wasn't good. I admired Christy's determination and enthusiasm to learn how to wrestle (and she looked hot), but it was way too soon for her to be in a title match, especially at WM! Trish kept the pace going and pulled some alright moves out of Christy, while Lita provided drama at ringside. Trish won, and retained the title. (2.5/5)

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle
Match of the night! I've never been a big fan of Angle, but he impressed me here. And of course Shawn is one of my all time favourite wrestlers, and he lives up to his Mr Wrestlemania name. A great back and forth match, with a good amount of mat wrestling and high flying moves (mostly from Shawn). There were so many moments where either could have won, but Angle pulled it out in the end, and made Shawn tap out after a excruitatingly long time in the Ankle Lock. (5/5)

Next we had a look at one of the Wrestlemania 21 movie parodies. This one was the Basic Instant parody, which was very funny. Stacy Keibler starred as the criminal, with Chris Benoit, Christian and Chris Jericho as the interrogators. Stacy was really hot, and the bit when Christian said ""I love you"" cracked me up. There's also some funny aftermath with Mae Young and the Fabulous Moolah which causes the boys to throw up. Very funny stuff.

Next we had Rowdy Roddy Piper hosting a special edition of Piper's Pit. The special guest was everybody's favourite Hall Of Famer, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stone Cold & Roddy traded insults and lines until Carlito interrupted and tried to be funny. In the end, Stone Cold stuns both Carlito & Piper and has a beer bash.

Then they show my favourite of the parodies, the Taxi Driver trailer. This one is soooooo funny, I laugh everytime I see it. You see lots of WWE superstars saying the famous ""You talking to me?"" line, while some have problems. Big Show can't get his shot done as first he's too tall for the shot, then his jacket rips then he gets hit in the head with the microphone - then when they finally go to take it, he's cut off xD Batista also has problems as he doesn't understand the line, he asks the director the line but when the director says ""You talking to me?"" Batista misunderstands and thinks he's actually asking him that xDD Then at the end, Batista comes along and is asked why he's there and he finally replies ""You talking to me?"" xD It's hilarious, I can never get tired of this trailer, ever. Definitely watch this one!

Sumo Match
Big Show vs Akebono
What the heck was this? Big Show was wasted here, instead of giving him an actual match they put him in a silly sumo wrestling match that was only 5 minutes long. Akebono easily wins, although Big Show manages to lift him. They shake hands afterwards. Watch this once, and then skip it every other time. (1/5)

WWE Championship Match
JBL (champion) vs John Cena
I love John Cena to pieces, but this match wasn't good. It was slow, sloppy and John wins out of the blue. The only redeeming feature of this match was that it ended JBL's incredibly boring title reign, and give John main event status. Otherwise, this is a very disappointing match. I do like John's celebration after he wins, he's genuinely pleased to win. (2/5)

Then the 2005 WWE Hall Of Fame is introduced, with the WWE Divas accompanying them out. It was an awesome way to give them some recognition.

World Heavyweight Championship Match
Triple H (champion) vs Batista
This match was much better then the WWE title, but it wasn't Triple H and Batista's best match together (their best match was Hell In A Cell at Vengeance 05 in my opinion). But still, I was thankful this was the last match instead of JBL/John. Motorhead played Triple H's entrance music, and I think they sounded terrible. The match itself was pretty good, Batista beat the snot out of Triple H towards the end of the match. Ric Flair gets involved, but that isn't enough to stop Batista, who wins the WHC. (3.5/5)

This 3 disc set is packed with extras, let's check them out:
Wrestlemania Goes Hollywood movie parodies

All the trailers they made, including the two shown on the show. The Taxi Driver parody is still my favourite, but they're all good. Highlights include Eddie Gurerro & Booker T as FBI agents (Eddie: ""You know what they call Wrestlemania in France? Wrestlemania"" xD), Kurt Angle with hair in a When Harry Met Sally parody, Eugene portraying Forrest Gump and William Regal shouting ""Run, Eugene, run!"" and Triple H putting on a pretty good Scottish accent for a Braveheart parody. There's also a behind the scenes video of the making of the parodies with some funny moments - including somebody yelling ""You suck!"" at Kurt Angle and Ric Flair falling off a horse.
There's three career highlight videos for Shawn Michaels, Kurt Angle and The Undertaker. Taker's one showed all his previous Wrestlemania opponents and counted down from 12 to 1.
There's two videos on the media apperances leading up to WM, where the superstars meet fans and have fun, and also a acappella performance of Motorhead singing Triple H's theme tune, while Triple H nods along with them.
Then there's the pre-show battle royal where all the wrestlers who didn't get on the card participated in. It's a lot of fun and should have been on the main card instead of the Sumo match. There's many funny moments, but in the end Booker T wins.

Disc 3 contains the whole 2005 Hall Of Fame ceremony. Superstars inducted were Cowboy Bob Orton (inducted by his son Randy), Nikalai Volkoff (inducted by Jim Ross), Jimmy Hart (inducted by Jerry Lawler), the Iron Sheik (inducted by Sgt Slaughter), Paul Orndoff (inducted by Bobby Heenan), Roddy Piper (inducted by Ric Flair) and Hulk Hogan (inducted by Sylvester Stallone).
Highlights were the Iron Sheik's speech, everybody was laughing throughout it. Bobby Heenan also provided many laughs (especially when he said right after the Sheik finished, ""I have no idea what he just said!""), while Ric Flair told some funny stories about Roddy Piper.

2194022,4,B0006SSNXW,"The event was good.  Considering how much I liked 22 and disliked 20, I expected something in the middle.

Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio
Classic match.  WWE-style booking has been tossed aside for more high-impact style, faintly reminiscent of WCW's cruiserweight division, and becomes something spectacular.  (10/10)

Money in the Bank
Edge vs Christian vs Shelton Benjamin vs NO ONE vs Kane vs Chris Jericho
Typical of these numerous man ladder matches, it was a spotfest, but an entertaining one at that.  It had more time to spend than the one from Wrestlemania 22.  Didn't exceed such things as, say, the Tables Ladders and Chairs matches between the Dudleys, Hardys, and Edge and Christian.  (9/10)

Eugene comes out, Muhammed Hassan and Daivari come out to beat him up and complain that they weren't a part of Wrestlemania.  Hulk Hogan comes out and beats them up, because Hulk Hogan is American, and they are not.  Hassan comes from some crazy Arab country called ""Detroit, Michigan"" and Daivari is from an even crazier Persian country called ""Minneapolis, Minnesota"".

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton
Master of the Chinlock, stilted.  mechanical.  promos, and allegedly using a diva's gymbag as a toilet, Randy Orton against Undertaker.  Orton wasn't going to win this match, and anyone who thought otherwise was clearly out of their mind.  They put on a boring match saved only by... well, it wasn't saved.  (4/10)

WWE Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (C) vs Christy Hemme
I don't remember this one.  Which is both a good thing (it wasn't horrible) and a bad thing (it wasn't good).  (4/10)

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle
The build-up to this match was amazing.  You would almost believe these two legitimately hate each other.  And how does a man who hates another man attack him?  Put him in a series of headlocks lasting just under 10 minutes nonstop.  That's right.  Aside from that abortion of restholds put on by Michaels, the match became a classic, and kept us on edge with its ending.  (9/10)

Piper's Pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin.  What the hell happened here.  Apparently Austin was some sort of ""rebel"" in the WWE, and to sum it all up, Austin gives a stunner to Carlito and Roddy Piper.

Sumo Match
The Big Show vs Akebono
Big Show gets thrown the hell out of the ring and shows us a lot of his bare inner thighs.  (3/10)

WWE Championship Match
John Bradshaw Layfield (C) vs John Cena
This was that match which started the infamous Cena period of nearly infinite title reigns and infinite title shots when he didn't have it.  It is of my firm and unwaivering opinion that Cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling since The Great Khali, Gobbledygooker, Katie Vick, Ed Ferrara's ""Oklahoma"", David Arquette, and Vince Russo after 1999.

This match had December 2 Dismember tendencies... specifically the match between Balls Mahoney and Matt Striker, in which Balls got maybe 4 offensive moves in, while Striker dominates him the entire match, and Balls suddenly wins out of nowhere.

In this same way, not only did JBL DOMINATE Cena virtually the ENTIRE match, but he actually impressed me, a hardened disillusioned smark, with some of the absolute BEST wrestling I've seen Layfield do in his ENTIRE career.  This was a glorified squash match with a twist ending which sees Cena randomly catch JBL in a generic stuttering Fireman's Carry (also known as foo, or ""FU"") and win the title.  (3/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H (C) vs Batista
Motorhead's Lemmy shows he cannot physically learn the lyrics to Triple H's theme music, in a repeat performance of their bombing of HHH's entrance at Wrestlemania X7.

The match, meanwhile, was classic Triple H and that monster heel Batista I came to love in late 2003.  It was no classic match or purist dream, or even a brawl.  It was a solid power match with heavy emphasis on strength, endurance, and muscles.  Great way to drop a title, something Smackdown totally bombed with in the WWE championship match.  (8/10)

Seriously... what was with the WWE Championship match?  As much as I hate Cena, I have to say that the way they gave him the championship was the equivalent of Mikey Whipwreck winning the ECW Championship.  They made Cena out to be the clumsy, trash-talking oaf who can't back up his words, and only won by accident.

Aside from that, and other things, it was a good event.",1204675200,,4378,4.813422818791946

AT THIS POINT, BATISTA WAS A BETTER WRESTLER THAN HE IS NOW. EDDIE VS. REY WAS A GOOD WRESTLING MATCH TO KICK OFF THE SHOW.

2194027,4,B0006SSNXW,"This will be a review of the whole WrestleMania 21 set, not just the event itself. Discs 1 & 2 holds the WrestleMania 21 event with some of the second and third discs holding great extra bonus footage that includes all of the WrestleMania 21 movie parodies & the 2005 Hall Of Fame Ceremony.

Disc One:
Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was one of the better matches in Eddie Guerrero's & Rey Mysterio's almost year long feud. This was also before Eddie Guerrero's heel turn so they just went out there and wrestled straight up with no special gimmicks or anything. A great opening bout for WrestleMania 21 with Rey Mysterio & Eddie Guerrero producing a solid, back and forth match. 4/5

Around here is a backstage segment involving (at the time) WWE Champion J.B.L. with Orlando Jordan running into World Heavyweight Champion Triple H with Ric Flair by his side. I note this because this was one of the few and rare times J.B.L. & HHH has had any interaction with each other in their careers (besides their run-ins together in 2008). Its something interesting to check out and I recommend not skipping over.

Kane Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Edge Vs. Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian Vs. Chris Benoit (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - The MITB Ladder Match makes it's debut here at WM 21! Shelton Benjamin was the break out star in the match as he created his own highlight reel. Tons of great ladder spots in the match. This being the first MITB Ladder Match, it still stands the test of time of arguabably being the best MITB Match thus far in history. The second best match of the night. 5/5

An inring segment occurs here as Muhammed Mussan comes to the ring and beats up Eugene right before ""The Immortal"" Hulk Hogan makes an appearence and has a nice retro moment that takes everybody back in time.

Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - Orton was wrestling with an injured shoulder at the time but he still performed well with the Undertaker and this was a great match. Once again, the Undertaker has a memorable entrance but that was only frosting on the cake as this match was still good with a special cameo appearence from ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton and his ""cast"" in the end. To me, this was Randy Orton's & Undertaker's second best match of their feud with the first being their Hell In A Cell Match in December at Armageddon. 4.5/5

Women's Champion Trish Stratus Vs. Christy Hemme - Though Christy isn't a bad ""performer"" persay, but she didn't belong in the same ring as Trish for the Women's Title. Trish did her best to try to put Christy over but it just didn't work out. Lita was at ringside on the behalf of Christy but that factor still didn't work for this match. Its watchable but nothing memorbale. 1.5/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Shawn Michaels - This was just a classic confrontation between two of the very best ever! Just a modern day classic. Match of the night...and of the year. 5/5

Piper's Pit w/Stone Cold Steve Austin - Two of the most ""rowdiest"" and unpredictable characters in WWE history gets face to face with each other as Stone Cold Steve Austin is Rowdy Roddy Piper's guest for Piper's Pit. This was interesting because nobody knew where this was going unitl Carlito came out and gets taken out by the ""Rowdy One"" & the ""Texas Rattlesnake"". Steve Austin then stuns Roddy Piper and has his typical Stone Cold beer bash. However, this was still a good moment in WrestleMania history involving Stone Cold Steve Austin & Rowdy Roddy Piper.

The Big Show Vs. Akebono (Sumo Match) - This was just boring as the two stalled too much and just wasted time (much like Brock Lesnar & Bill Goldberg a year ago at WM 20). Just a waste of the PPV. 1/5

DISC Two:
John Cena Vs. WWE Champion John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield - Not the worst WWE Title Match in history but it is still pretty bad. JBL has a nice entrance but it didn't help the match out at all. JBL morely dominates the match until John Cena has a standard Cena ""comeback"" win and becomes WWE Champion for the first time after hitting three comeback moves followed by the FU. A poor WWE Title Match & such a waste. 2.5/5

World Heavyweight Champion Triple H Vs. Batista - HHH has a great entrance as Motorhead sings him to the ring with the match not being that bad either. HHH basically gets the better of Batista until HHH, & Ric Flair for that matter, ticks the Animal off and the ""beast is unleashed"". From there, Batista destroys HHH with HHH getting bloody in the process. This was a good main event as it ended WrestleMania on high note though the match doesn't top their Hell In A Cell Match two months later but this was still a good World Title Match nevertheless. 4.25/5

The rest of disc 2 has great extra bonus footage as it holds all of the WrestleMania 21 movie parodies, bloopers & outtakes, a pre-match WrestleMania 21 Battle Royal with the superstars of Raw & Smackdown participating in it who didn't make it to the main show with Booker T winning it, career highlight videos of Kurt Angle, HBK, & the Undertaker. Special match promotions of HBK versus Kurt Angle, Batista versus HHH, & John Cena versus JBL. Also, special Confiditional pieces highlighting the WrestleMania 21 weekend & Motorhead doing an ""unplugged"" performance backstage with HHH.

Disc Three:
The third disc holds the complete Hall Of Fame Ceremony presented the night before WrestleMania 21 (as it only showed Piper's & Hogan's induction on TV). ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund hosts the ceremony as Randy Orton inducts his father, ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton, Jim Ross inducts Nikolai Volkoff, Sgt. Slaughter inducts The Iron Sheik (who gets on Kurt Angle & makes reference to beating Bob Backlund), Jerry Lawler inducts an emotional Jimmy Hart, Bobby Heenan's comical induction of ""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff, Ric Flair sharing stories before his introduction of ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, & finally Sylvester Stallone inducts ""The Immortal"" Hulk Hogan with the crowd going nuts for a seemingly long time.

WrestleMania 21 Went Hollywood but came out lacklusting but thankfully the extra bonus footage and the Hall Of Fame Ceremony made up for it. WrestleMania 21 is recommended.",1169251200,,6128,4.667284522706209

Good back and forth action. Can't say I am a fan of Rey, and was never a fan of Eddie, but this is a good opener. Decent match, and a good way to start the show. 7/10

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Edge vs. Kane vs. Chris Benoit vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho
Great idea for a match, and very entertaining. Big spotfest, and this match doesn't dissapoint. Great ahtletes in the ring, Shelton puts on one hell of a performance. Excellent ladder match, don't pass this up. 8/10

3. Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker
I, like many people, was expecting WWE to give Orton the push as the ""Legend Killer"" and have Undertaker go 12-1. Thankfully, I was pleasantly suprised. Very exciting match, these two worked well together in the ring. Orton proves why he deserves to be in the ring, and probably Undertaker's best 'Mania performance since X-7 against Triple H. Great match overall, very suspenseful. 8.5/10

4. Women's Championship Match: Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus(c)
Nothing good here, just a standard Women's title match. Trish is clearly the better wrestler here, as Christy is nothing fantastic in the ring. Watchable, but wouldn't watch again. 4/10

5. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels
""Mr. Wrestlemania"" certainly proves that he is deserving of the nickname in this match. HBK is quite possibly the greatest in-ring performer of all time, and Kurt Angle is not far behind. Put together, these two put on a ""wrestling clinic"" as Angle calls it himself. Bit of a slow start, but it builds and builds into a fast-paced and exciting match thats hard to predict. A few great spots and top-notch performances by both men. Without question one of the best 'Mania matches of all time. Definitely an instant classic, don't pass this up under any circumstances. 9.5/10

6. Sumo Match: Akebono vs. Big Show
As bad as it sounds, its worse. Terrible idea, terrible match. Skip this. 1/10

7. WWE Championship Match: John Cena vs. JBL (c)
Interesting pairing of the two. Didn't think they would work well together in the ring, and they don't. A brawl, but a boring one at that. Good to see JBL finally lose the title, and for Cena to win it for the first time, but a predictable match thats only watchable, nothing more. 6/10

8. World Heavyweight Championship Match: Batista vs. Triple H (c)
This was another interesting pairing, as I never figured that I'd see these two headline Wrestlemania. Great buildup to the match though, considering Batista broke away from Evolution and turned on Triple H. Motorhead plays Triple H's theme song and butchers their own song yet again. Cool how HHH comes up from the stage, but painful singing in the background. Good match thats very physical and brutal, but a predictable ending. Didn't really feel like a main event, but its forgiveable since these two give good performances. Good match, good ending. 8.25/10

Overall, Wrestlemania 21 was a good show with a couple duds. The WWE Championship match is passable, and the Women's title match and the Sumo match should be skipped, but everything else seems to fit. The Undertaker and Randy Orton put on a good match thats very suspenseful, and the Money in the Bank concept is a great idea, with excellent talent in the ring. The main event wasn't as big as Wrestlemania XX's main event, but it was still a good match that shouldn't be overlooked.

Match of the Night: Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels, easily. These two put on a show that I know I will never forget. Their match at Vengeance is excellent as well; these two just seem to click in the ring, and boy do we benefit. They even got the relatively dead California crowd into it, and they tore the house down.",1145750400,,3709,4.71141975308642

1. Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero.

Excellent match to start, features good athleticism from both competitors. Definately a rivalry worth following after the event too. 3/5.

2. Money in the bank Ladder Match.

I've never seen a ladder match that failed to entertain the crowd, this was no exception. Excellent performances from all six men, including Edge and Christian working together to use and old tag team move of theirs on Kane. You have to admire Chris Benoit's sheer determination in the match, but it just wasn't his night. 4/5.

3. Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker.

It was pretty obvious who the winner would be, but still an excellent match from Smackdown, fuelling a rivalry that lasted up to December. Undertaker is still in excellent physical condition, the fact that this was his thirteenth Wrestlemania didn't stop him. 3/5.

4. Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus.

Pretty average, but you can't expect better from a women's match. Status deserves the championship as Hemme has never excelled in the ring. 2/5.

5. Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels.

Arguably the most spectacular match of the night, and lived up to all expectations. Great ending. 5/5.

6. Sumo Match Big Show vs Akebono.

Pretty poor. Even worse than you'd expect it to be. Although the winner wasn't obvious at the start, it's definately worth skipping. 1/5.

7. JBL vs John Cena.

John Bradshaw Layfield has never been main event-worthy from many peoples perspectives, this match shows why. Quite short, although the ending was abrupt in a good way, and did have many people on their feet. 2.5/5.

8. Triple H vs Batista.

Quite a good match, but for a main event it wasn't brilliant. Also marks the fifth time in a row the Royal Rumble winner has gone on to win at the main event of Wrestlemania. Triple H and Batista are both pretty exhausted at the end, but again the result of the match was highly predictable. 3.5/5.",1144108800,,2096,4.7645429362880884

2194034,3,B0006SSNXW,"Depending on the type of wrestling fan you are, you either loved it or simply thought it was alright. It had a classic in Michaels vs. Angle, despite the hype lessening it's impact, you still shouldn't be fooled into thinking it was a letdown. What was a letdown was Rey vs. Eddie, although they delivered a respectable match that half the guys in WWE couldn't hope to match today. Undertaker vs. Orton was a great surprise, and the tension coupled with some surprisingly good wrestling made for a possible show-stealer(after Michaels and Angle, of course). The MITB wasn't a complete spot-fest, so in a sense it delivered one of the most exciting matches of the night. This is where one division of fans classify it as 'alright', as wrestling purists(those that actually enjoy wrestling) will loathe Big Show vs. Akebono, JBL vs. John Cena, and Trish vs. Christy. Batista vs. HHH was solid but undeserving of being Wrestlemanias main event. It could be classified as a great event by those interested in the entertainment aspects, as Hogan's return and Piper's Pit were relatively entertaining, and it certainly had a lot of sizzle with some great entrances and appearances by celebrities. Wrestling-wise, to sum up, one incredible match(Angle/Michaels), one surprisingly good match(Undertaker/Orton), three okay matches(MITB, Eddie/Rey, Batista/HHH), two dreadful matches(JBL/Cena, Trish/Christy), and one disaster(Big Show/Akebono). Wrestlemania 21 had a lot of style, but not as much substance, so a 3-star rating seems justified.",1143158400,,1534,5.3429752066115705
2194035,5,B0006SSNXW,"Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero

Outstanding match to begin WM21! This match had it all; technical action, high-flying action and psychology. Not for one second did this match have a boring moment. The only problem I have with this, is the time given, another 5 to 10 minutes would have been accepted happily.

RATING: 91/100

Money in The Bank Ladder Match

Great display of athleticism by many of the 6 competitors (especially Benjamin). This match had some great spots but also a few overdone ones. Overall a very good match that was entirely entertaining.

RATING: 89/100

Christy vs. Trish

Poor match that probably should have been left off for Raw or Backlash. This would have given Christy a little more time to brush up on some skills.

RATING: 57/100

Undertaker vs. Orton

This was a great match that kept me on the edge of my seat to see if Taker could beat Orton. The fact that Orton was Undertaker's opponent definitely added some uncertainty for me as to who would win the match, especially because I knew Orton would be in for a push and what better way to do it than to have him kill Undertaker's legendary streak. However, I am very happy that Deadman won and I think the unpredictability of the match was handled very well with many extremely close nearfalls. Excellent match!

RATING: 91/100

HBK vs. Angle

This match is probably the best singles match I have ever seen, it had it all, including intensity, technical action, excellent high-flying moves, nearfalls and unmatched overall quality. Outstanding use of nearfalls where each man kicked out of the others finisher. Perfect length and perfect ending to an as close to perfect one on one match you can get!

RATING: 97/100

Pipers Pit

Quite a good segment that did what it needed to do and kept the fans happy

RATING: 80/100

Sumo Match

Not a great choice of match, but was acceptable.

RATING: 50/100

Cena vs. JBL

Terrible first main event! I would expect so much more for a Title match at WM. I guess you could say the reason for the ""high"" rating is that JBL eventually lost the title but little did I know that we would also have trouble with Cena losing the title later on in the year and still now! Very disappointing.

RATING: 68/100

HHH vs. Batista

A good if not excellent main event to WM21. The build-up was exceptional into the match and considering who was challenging, the match lived up to the hype. Well booked and a nice little ending to a good Wmania

RATING: 86/100

79% - Very good Mania that had excellent lower to midcard matches from each show and excellent interpromotional matches. The main events don't compare to WM20, but are still satisfactory.

2194037,4,B0006SSNXW,"While WM21 is truly deserving of the title of Wrestlemania, we saw it coming; the emergence of Cena and Batista. One thing that I will say about WM21 is that is has set the tone for wrestling today. The last wrestlemania to do that was WM17 when Austin turned heel, won the championship, and led the WCW invasion angle which went on all of 2001. But this WM did it even more that 17. Cena is still champion, and if it was not for injury, Batista would still reign supreme on Smackdown. Batista winning the championship was great, in a solid match, but Cena won the belt just a little bit to fast for me. The match was not TOO bad, but it seemed rushed.

The best match on the show is obviously HBK/Angle. Great stuff. Two guys that can hold their own in the ring. Two great performers. I know HBK broke the tie, but I could see these two wrestle a few more times.

Orton/Undertaker was also a good match. Orton may not be the greatest wrestle to tangle with the Taker at Wrestlemania, but he gave the Undertaker the best challenge and the toughest time. Undertaker out quicked Kane at WM14, outbrawled HHH at WM17, outsmarted Nash at WM12, but not Orton. Orton went toe to toe with the Undertaker, and kept it in the ring. In my opinion Orton defeated himself.

Sumo match um yeah

Guerrero/Mysterio was also a good match. When have they ever had a bad match though? Typically cruiseweight match.

2194043,4,B0006SSNXW,"Overall, Wrestlemania 21 was a very good show, but it has one or two bad matches. The good matches, though, were so good that its worth buying this DVD.

Rey Mysterio v. Eddie Guerrero

Two great wrestlers start the show just right. They should've been given a little more time, but this was exciting, and had some great back and forth action. The match could have been over at any point, but these two kept battling it out. Great match.

Edge v. Kane v. Chris Benoit v. Christian v. Shelton Benjamin v. Chris Jericho, Ladder Match

This one was definitely one to see. Alot of great action, and really great use of the ladders without managing to get repetitive. The ending was pretty predictable, but this was a ton of fun and so exciting.

Randy Orton v. Undertaker

I wasn't expecting much from this match because the Undertaker is getting old and isn't quite the wrestler he once was. However, these two put on a great match. Sure the Undertaker was a little off, but these two had great chemistry (at the time anyway) and this match was back and forth and had a great ending.

Trish Stratus (C) v. Christy Hemme

This match was okay. Hemme was never a great wrestler, and Trish did what she could to carry her through it. Not the best women's match I've seen, but not terrible.

Kurt Angle v. Shawn Michaels

There's not much to say about this match. It was outstanding, ranking up there with Angle v. Benoit at the 2003 Royal Rumble. These two are great in the ring and put on a tremendous show. An instant classic that must be seen.

Akebono v. Big Show, Sumo Match

Skip this. It was a waste of time. The Big Show could have been given a real match and it would have been much better.

John Bradshaw Layfield (C) v. John Cena

Why? Neither of these guys belong in the main event at Wrestlemania. JBL was a decent champion, but he isn't an especially good wrestler. Cena was pretty lousy at this time, and hasn't improved that much since. This match was dull, ended abruptly and was just a waste of time. Easily the worst WRESTLING match of the night.

Triple H (C) v. Batista

This was much better, though it still wasn't quite the main event I might have hoped for, considering Wrestlemania XX. Triple H is a very good wrestler, and given the right opponent, Batista can look excellent. Very physical, aggressive match.

Perhaps the worst thing about this pay per view was that five of the matches were very predictable, and I would've bet my life on the results of the main events. Definitely worth seeing this show, though, at least for the six-man ladder match and Angle-Michaels I.",1140220800,8,2594,4.49680170575693

2194051,4,B0006SSNXW,"Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men walked into this match as WWE Tag Team Championship partners while Rey came out in his traditional unique WrestleMania outfit that definitely represented his Mexican heritage being in Los Angeles.  Both men did some back & forth wrestling with Eddie getting getting the upper hand by monkeyflipping Mysterio to the outside of the ring.  Eddie tried various submission holds such as the surfboard & STF while also delivering various backbreakers & vertical suplexes while Rey relied on an aerial attack such as the corkscrew plancha over the top & later a seated senton.  Both men knew each other so well that we got a bunch of sequences out counter & escaping each others holds in what was a great opening match for WrestleMania.
[Rey Mysterio: Life Behind The Mask]

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Edge vs. Christian - This was the first ever Money In The Bank match where the object of the match is to grab the briefcase at the top that contains a contract to challenge any World Champion whenever he sees fit in the next year. As expected with a multiman ladder match, chaos all over the place with everyone going after Kane on the ramp before the bell, everyone diving on top of everyone else on the outside, Benoit crossfacing anyone in sight, Benjamin splashing Edge in the corner on the ladder, everyone fighting on 3 ladders at once, Edge T-Bone'd off the ladder, and Benoit's headbutt off the ladder that caused him to bleed from the head. I was here LIVE & to quote Joey Styles ""OH MY GOD!"" The show-stealer here though was Shelton Benjamin as he looked like Spider Man with the majority of the moves he was pulling off involving the ladders. As a side note, watch Kane's intro because that was something to see with the ladders on fire.
[The Ladder Match]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - ""The Legend Killer"" was out to end the legend of Undertaker's streak as Orton kept trying to go for quick covers early to no avail.  Both men would go on to exchange punches with Taker attempting his Dragon Sleeper submission that was countered into a DDT & later countering the chokeslam into an RKO as both men traded momentum causing Randy to resort to desperate tactics including an appearance from his father using his trademark cast on his arm before Orton's overconfidence at one point came back to haunt him & cost him the match.  Orton came into this match with an injury that would eventually have him out of action throughout the spring & summer so this was as good as it could be taking that into consideration as they would go on to have better matches throughout the rest of the year.

Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme - Recently injured Lita was in Christy's corner but in a nutshell, Christy was only in this match as she was the WWE Playboy cover girl for this year but she wasn't good in the ring as Trish carried this match to the point where it's watchable but easily forgettable.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle - This was one of the most highly anticipated dream matches in history at that time. Shawn started this off with a slap in the face to Angle causing Kurt to get real aggressive with his amateur wrestling doing various takedowns & riding however Shawn showed a few amateur tricks of his own & even outwrestled Kurt. Kurt started to work over Shawn's back with an Angle Slam into the ringpost & many belly to belly suplexes including one attempt to do a german suplex off the ring apron onto the floor. Shawn had to resort to ""desperate measures"" to prevent that before performing his own crossbody dive onto Angle on an announce table. The matches got more aggressive & intense as it went on as Shawn was able to counter the anklelock various times while Angle delivered another Angle Slam off the top rope as both men came very close with the nearfalls & a very dramatic ending. A modern day classic encounter, period.
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]

Sumo Match: Big Show vs. Akebono - For those who don't know who Akebono is, he's a real life sumo-wrestling champion in Japan who made an appearance on the recent WWE tour of Japan interacting with Show leading to this match.  Outside of seeing Show in the sumo-thong, there was nothing special about this.

WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. John Cena - J.B.L. had a great entrance with the Presidential limo & police escort into the arena but it goes downhill from there as it was basically J.B.L. beating down Cena throughout the whole match only for Cena hits three strong moves, the F.U., and wins the match.  This was definitely one of the worst WWE Championship matches in history & a horrible way (even foreshadowing on some people's opinions) to begin the first of many title reigns of John Cena & his beginning of being the top guy in the company.

World Champion Triple H vs. Batista - Motorhead performed Triple H to the ring while he also had Ric Flair in his corner.  Batista showed his power advantage early with impactful moves like a high back body drop & powerslam causing Flair to keep getting involved for Triple H to get the advantage.  Triple H proceeded to show why he's the ""cerebral assassin"" by focusing on Batista's back using the guardrail along with other moves like the suplex, backbreaker, and spinebuster.  The action spilled over the floor where the steel steps came into play for both men to the point where Triple H was busted open as a result with Batista just continuing to just pound on his bleeding head.  Flair again attempted to get involved only for Batista to take him out & continued to ""unleash the animal"" as he was able to power out of the pedigree & dominate his way to his first World Championship.

Also on the show was Lillian Garcia signing ""America The Beautiful"", a special Piper's Pit featuring the return of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Eugene making an appearance before being interrupted by Muhammed Hassan before he was interrupted by the WrestleMania return of Hulk Hogan.

DVD extras include the pre-show RAW vs. SmackDown battle royal, all of the ""WrestleMania Goes Hollywood"" movie parodies they did including outtakes, commercial spots for the main event matches, special career highlight features on Kurt Angle & Shawn Michaels & Undertaker, two ""Confidential"" pieces on the WrestleMania weekend & media appearances, and Motorhead doing a backstage ""unplugged"" performance.

Included as well is the COMPLETE Hall Of Fame ceremony they had the night before that Mean Gene Okerland hosted as Randy Orton induced his dad Cowboy Bob Orton, Jim Ross inducted Nikolai Volkoff, and Jerry Lawler inducted an emotional Jimmy Hart.  The real highlights start were when Sgt. Slaughter inducted the Iron Sheik, who stole the whole show & had everyone laughing throughout his entire speech.  Bobby Heenan inducted Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff but ripped into a loudmouth fan in the front row beforehand.  Ric Flair sharing some ""on the road"" stories before inducting Roddy Piper.  And Sylvester Stallone inducting Hulk Hogan with the crowd going crazy for the longest time.

This event definitely had it's highlights such as the classic encounter between Shawn & Kurt, a quality encounter between Mysterio & Guerrero in what turned out to be Eddie's last Mania match, the first ever Money In The Bank Ladder match, and the returns of legends such as Hogan & Piper & Austin.  This PPV also did it's job in establishing the new faces & main eventers for the future in John Cena & Batista while also continuing Taker's streak.  The only real low points were the disappointing WWE Title match (which they made up for with the ""I Quit"" match at Judgment Day), Sumo Match, and the divas match but overall was a enjoyable & quality WrestleMania (my first one I saw live).",1135900800,11,7828,4.727606461086637

There was some real potential here, but they just pulled what I like to call a ""Chicago Cub"" and took all that hype and attention and flushed it down the toilet. Too bad.

2194063,4,B0006SSNXW,"Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero- Eddie was clearly the fan favorite going into this match. I must say I was surprised that Rey won.. So let's get into the match... During this match I got annoyed that Rey had to keep fixing his mask.. which led to some bad spots... Eddie and Rey had some good reversals in this match and the chemistry was off the charts and they sure enough milked the crowds... I was into this match the majority of the time and I actually liked the finish when Rey out of nowhere rolled him up for the 3.. Awesome finish.. 4 stars

Money In the Bank Ladder Match- I will say this.. Shelton Benjamin is one of the most underrated wrestlers on the Raw roster.. I'd love to see him get a world title shot... (Too bad he don't have a ""gimmick"" or ""mic"" skills).. I just think he deserves it and would make a good champion.. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but oh well.. This match had a hell of a lot of spots.. And you could see the majority of them coming which made the match even better... I actually thought that it was good they jumped into the ""spots"" because 10 minute of ""wrestling"" in a ""ladder match"".. Sorry man.. I just don't see this being a ""wrestling match"".. Its supposed to be balls out and energetic.. Anyway this match DEFINATELY pleased me and was one of the top 3 matches on this card... Good chemistry 4 3/4 stars

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton- This match was the legend vs. legend killer match.. This match started off with Taker in control.. And I must say this match was impressive to say the least.. Once again.. good chemistry.. which I put for the previous 3 matches and I liked the finish.. Kept me on my heels.. I was just waiting for Taker to kick out of that reversal of the chokeslam into that RKO.. GOOD MATCH!!.. 4 1/2

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme Womens Title- This match was dull for the most part.. Had some ok parts.. Trish carried the majority of her matches and this one as well. Trish is an excellent Womens Champ and excellent wrestler.. Overall.. There were so many spots that Christy messed up in this match but I must give her credit for effort.. I'd atleast like to see a match thats bad with effort then crap like Goldberg vs. Brock at WM 20..... But I must add that I'd have liked if Christy imitated Trish how she bows like Trish imitated her jumping up and down.. Would have added some excitement to the match you could say.. Overall 1 star for effort from Christy

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels- Of course this was the best match... If you haven't seen this match.. Shame on you.. ""You screwed Bret"" was chanted at Shawn.. And I agree.. If it wasn't for the screwjob Bret would have never went to WCW and had that groin injury which ended his career.. And he could have possibly faced Kurt Angle.. Which would be an outstanding match.. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE BRET VS. ANGLE!!. Anyway, I will not comment on this too much because this match was jam packed with great moves and reversals etc.. I will just simply put ""Classic"".. 5 stars

Big Show vs. Akebono Sumo Match- Can you say ""filler?"".. Out of respect for Sumo wrestling fans.. I will simply not grade this...

Cena vs. JBL- This match was so slow at the beginning but got a tiny bit better at the end.. It was definately not Wrestlemani caliber and this was the second worst match of the night with exception to Sumo match which I didn't grade.. worst being Womens title match.. It gets 2 stars for the heat at the end...

HHH vs. Batista- In my opinion this match could have been WAY better!! It started off slow which was good in my opinion because they were ""testing"" each other.. HHH sold Batista pretty well.. I hated this match in a way because it seemed to much of a squash match for Batista... I hated the ending.. This match was lacking something in my opinion and if you saw this match you WOULD know what I mean. It was also a short match in my opinion.. I will give this match with 2 1/2 stars for towards the end and am taking off for shortness,lacking of, and squash style match.. Could have been a 4 match in my opinion

Overall- This WM was a good one.. Had a lot of good and great matches.. Lived up to hype and had matches I didn't think would be as good and some that didn't meet my expectations.. Overall AWESOME WM.. and definately recommended.. I took off 1 star overall on the PPV from the main event which could have been SOOOOO much better!!",1130544000,,4410,4.3240628778718255

2194065,4,B0006SSNXW,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS.

I've made it a priority to buy the latest addition to the WrestleMania series whenever the DVD's become available on store shelves. I picked up WM 21 a bit later than usual this year due to a falling out with the majority of wrestling (I find that WWE is basically rehasing storylines from years past). I had also heard very few thoughts on this years WrestleMania... I figured I'd have heard at least some praise, but WM 21 basically came and went. I was surprised at myself when I bought the three-disc set earlier today. I was even more surprised when I discovered that WM 21 was one of the better WrestleMania's I've had the privilege of seeing, and definitely the best of last few years.

The show opened with a fast-paced bout between Guerrero and Mysterio, and -- while it was short-- I loved every minute of it. It's exactly what you'd come to expect from two luchadore style wrestlers, but they had all the right moves in all the right spots, keeping the match relatively fresh at all times and keeping it at a moderately fast pace throughout. I find that I enjoy Mysterio's outfits more and more every WM year, as this year he came out sporting half-Mexican, half-American attire. I respected the fact that the two shook hands afterward, even though (as most of you surely know) they were to fued heavily only a month or so later. Great way to open WrestleMania, and one of the better matches.
 *** 1/2 stars

The ""money in the bank"" match had a really lame gimmick behind it, I must admit. The winner of the second match-up would receive a shot at the world heavyweight championship in a years time... I found this all pointless because chances are that all six of the performers will probably receive a shot sometime down the road anyway. What can I say about this match? It was pure chaos, and I mean that in the best of ways. In one word: spotfest. From the moment the bell rang (and even prior to the bell), there was pure anarchy inside and out of the ring. I was surprised at some of the ways the ladders were used, especially by a Shelton Benjamin spot where he ran up a propped-up ladder and clotheslined Edge ten feet down. Benoit was the main player of the match, however, and he took some serious blows toward the end of everything. Another awesome match, and one to match the WM 2000 triple ladder match!
 **** stars

Maybe the reason why I didn't appreciate the third match pitting Undertaker against Orton was because I wasn't very into the storyline. It all seemed so meaningless for me, and just seemed like an attempt to get 'Taker on the card. Predictably, Undertaker came out on top. I find it interesting that his current record is 13-0 at WrestleMania. The number thirteen is a never a good omen, and I have a gut instict that Undertaker's record will be coming to an end next year. The one spot I did love, however, was at the climax of the match where Orton turned a chokeslam into a sickening RKO. I would have much preferred that Orton Sr. stayed out of the match, but I guess his run-in kept everyone interested. I can only take so many interferences in one night! Average match, but not deserving of a WrestleMania card.
 ** 1/2 stars

I don't really even know what to think of the women's championship match. I find it an insult that Vince would throw some non-deserving woman into the ring with champion Trish, all in the sake of having some eye-candy for his show. I loved the women's fatal four way match at one of the last WM's, and it was just lame seeing how far the womens division has come since then. It only made matters worse that Lita was at ringside instead of in the ring putting on a good performance. When will the WWE understand that the majority of women's matches just DON'T work!?
 1/2 star

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle was not only the match of the night, but possibly my favorite WrestleMania match of all time, bar none. These two guys put on the match of a LIFETIME, and I can't believe I heard nothing of it in the months to follow. There were so many amazing spots in this one that I can't even decide which to name first... Michaels slamming into the ring post was absolutely brutal, and he sold it like a mother -- yeah.  The moonsault onto Kurt on the announcers table was also simply crazy. If I remember correctly, Angle got really busted open mid-way into the match, and this only added to the overall package. Michaels sold the anklelock like a madman, and everything was just perfect. Angle delivered an Angle slam to HBK off the top rope, and that too made my day. The ending to the match literally kept me on the edge of my seat, and that is a hard thing to do. I recommend the show for this match alone, folks.
 PRICELESS (aka *****)

The Piper's Pit and sumo match all seemed like useless segments needed to fill in about fourty-five minutes of the show, and what a waste. By the end of the sumo match I was wishing that the WWE would've just given all the past matches (save the women's one) ten extra minutes. I'm tired of seeing Austin return, leave, return, leave, etc. Same with Hogan. Big Show in a sumo thong? Gross. Period.

I've never been a big fan of Cena or JBL, so the Smackdown main event being horrible was no letdown or surprise to me. I knew what to expect from both men, who are -- at least in my opinion -- downright boring, with little moves in their repitoire. Cena's gimmick is simply played out, and JBL doesn't even have a gimmick to begin with, aside from the fact that he reminds me of our current president. I can hardly remember this match, and I think it's best that I don't. This one thankfully only lasted around 15 minutes, but I found it truly unrealistic that thirteen minutes of the bout was Cena getting taken out, and the last two were Cena suddenly coming out of nowhere with the win. Please, give everyone what they want: an interesting title match with a deserving champ and a deserving number one contender!
 * 1/2 stars

The first, eh, ten minutes of Raw's main event was terrible. I began thinking of just turning the show off for good, when out of nowhere things began to get interesting. There was bloodshed on the part of Triple H (and I'm talking real bloodshed, not scripted). Triple H sold this so well, and Batista just fed on the energy of the audience. Another thing: Hollywood was awesome on this night. The crowd was on fire, and made the show even more worth watching. The main event was awesome for the rest of its duration, and overall I think it went very well.
 **** stars

Overall this is one of the better WM's. Like I said, I heard little of it before purchasing it, but I was throughly impressed with the way it turned out. Half of the matches were extraordinarily good, and the other half were from average to mediocre. In the end, it's a win-win situation. Enjoy!",1129852800,,6853,4.442675159235669

1) Eddie Gurrerro vs. Rey Mysterio

Steller performance by these ellite athletes. Rey Rey picks up the win. Not as great as there matches in the past but ok opener.

4/5

2) Money in the bank ladder match

World Title match on the line

Jericho vs. Benoit vs. Kane vs. Benjiman vs. Christian vs. Edge

Great Raw Opener. Some big highlight moves in this one. Didn't steal the show but was good enough to tie it with TLC II from WM X-Seven. Edge wins it

5/5

3)Randy Orton vs. Undertaker

Great match between these two. Taker and Orton have great chemistry in this match. Taker wins and continues his undefeated streak.

5/5

4) Women's Championship Match

Chrissy (w/ Lita) vs. Trish Stratus (Champion)

Not as boring as Sumo match but pretty wasteful of my time

1/5

5) Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. Kurt and Shawn put there hearts into this match. Defenatly best wrestling match. As great as Benoit/Angle at Wrestlemania X-seven. Angle wins it

6/5

6) Sumo Match

Big Show vs. Akebono

ZZZZZZZZ. Poor show he was put into this pathedic match

0/5

7) WWE Championship

John Cena vs. JBL (Champion)

This match should have been alittle longer. Watch this match so you can see JBL lose the title.

3/5

8) Main Event

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H (Champion) vs. Batista

Great Main Event. These 2 brought the house down. Not as good as WM 20 main event. But still good. Batista wins it.

2194073,4,B0006SSNXW,"As far as WrestleMania's and DVD videos go, this one is a keeper. It wasn't the best but it was far from the worst! First, I'll go into the matches and then the extras:

Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - This SMACKDOWN match up should've been a show stealer but was pretty good at best! I've seen better with these two. Still, not a bad opener.

Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Edge Vs. Christian Vs. Kane (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - This was RAW's opener to WrestleMania and it was much better than SMACKDOWN'S! While Edge was the winner, I think the other participants were more worthy of winning. Shelton's performance was the most noteworthy with his agile moves on the ladders and his incredible T-Bone off the ladder on Edge!

Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - In this RAW Vs. SMACKDOWN bout, this one was better than I'd thought it was going to be. Both men put in an incredible effort. While I am not a great UT fan, I do respect him. I TOTALLY HATE RANDY ORTON! Sure, he's a great performer but his attitude sucks! I cheer anytime anyone beats his a**, even ""The Game"" Triple H! Still, I have to give him props for the effort he gave! Great match up!

Trish Stratus Vs. Christy Hemme (WWE Women's Title) - WORST MATCH ON THE CARD! While women's matches aren't usually that great to begin with, this one was one of the worst! The only saving grace here is that Trish won thank God! She may be a b*tch but at least she's earned what she has. Christy may look good naked but it should take more than that to get a title shot! Watch this match once and then skip everytime you put in the disc that its on!

Shawn Michaels Vs. Kurt Angle - THE REAL MAIN EVENT OF WRESTLEMANIA! I know the world title matches are the official main events but I don't know too many people that cared about Cena Vs. JBL or Batista Vs. HHH! Some didn't even know they were on the card as many viewed this match as the main event!

This one was a back and forth effort on both men's part! A lot of high flying and ground game from both men! Its worth the 20 plus minutes of your life to watch!

Big Show Vs. Akebono (Sumo Match) - I'll be honest with you, I have never viewed this match nor do I have a desire too! From what I understand though, TBS was a good sport considering the sucky position he was put in!

JBL Vs. John Cena (WWE Title Match) - In one of his last bouts before being moved to RAW, John Cena took on JBL! This match, save the ending, was forgetable! Considering this was WrestleMania, you'd think Cena and JBL would've put a little more effort into their match!

HHH Vs. Batista (World Heavyweight Title Match) - While not a great bout, it was much better than Cena Vs. JBL! This does give us a glimpse into the next few months with these two!

2194075,4,B0006SSNXW,"This is a must have for all wrestling fans. I haven't watched wrestling in so long but I decided to buy this DVD on a whim and I am not disappointed that I did so.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Guerror.

The first of many matches between the two. You could tell the superstars knew the others moves very well. Both put on an excellent match. 4/5

Money in the Bank Ladder match

Had to be one of the two best matches on this DVD. Shelton Benjamin really showed his strength in this match. He could've been a member of Team Extreme back in the day. 5/5

Legend VS. Legend Killer

My second favorite match of the DVD. I've always been a fan of the Undertaker and he showed me why he's been in the business so long in this match. Randy Orton also showed that he wasn't by any means scared of the dead-man and knew exactly what to do in a match. 4/5

Woman's Championship match

I love Trish but this match was a bathroom break. Christy only knows a few moves so it mostly was a bunch of kicks that she did. They really need to give Trish some competetion (besides Lita) when she comes back to TV. 2/5

Inter-promotional match

Even though this match should've been the biggest one on the card, I wasn't that interested. Kurt Angle is a good wrestler but I wish he'd do something besides the angle lock ever two seconds. 3/5

Sumo Match.

There is something about these two half naked men that really questions my sexuality..no, I'm just kidding. It was over too soon and really just one man picking up another. 1/5

WWE Championship

I think the best part about this match was the end result. 3/5

World Heavyweight championship

Does Triple H ever go through a match without being the first one to bleed. He looked a hot mess. 4/5

All in all, this is a great DVD. I give it a 4/5",1126310400,,1772,4.25748502994012

  Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Christian vs. Shelton

  Benjamin vs. Edge vs. Kane

  Winner, Edge

  -Second best match on the card. Edge should have done more

  in the match to win. Benoit's selling of the arm was

  terrific and Shelton's performance made this match great

  ****1/2

3. The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

  Winner, The Undertaker

  -Better match than what everyone expected especially since

  Orton was injured. Taker's streak continues at 13. ****

4. WWE Women's Championship Match

  Trish Stratus (ch) vs. Christy (w/ Lita)

  Winner and still WWE Women's Champion, Trish Stratus by

  -Also better than anyone expected with Christy in the match.

  Trish is the best! **

5. Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

  Winner, Kurt Angle by submission

  -AWESOME AWESOME MATCH!!!! Match of the decade!!! HBK and

  Angle both put on possibly their best performance ever.

  -Possibly the worst World Championship Match in Mania

  better)

8. World Heavyweight Championship Match

  Triple H (ch) vs. Batista

  Winner and NEW World Heavyweight Champion, Batista by pinfall

  -Pretty good match, Definitely the right title match to end

  the show. It was pretty suspenseful as you didn't know

  whether Batista would win. Not as good as the rematch or

  the Hell in a Cell Match though but a solid bout

  nonetheless **1/2

-Overall this was a very good show. With four matches 4 stars or over and a solid main event, it is definitely worth the money. Just skip the WWE title match and the Sumo match and youll be fine. The Womens title match is good for T&A. Kind of a shame that so many solid wrestlers weren't on the card though. (Booker T, London, Chavo, Haas, Hassan, Tag Teams)",1126137600,,2446,4.766169154228856

2194079,4,B0006SSNXW,"Great Wrestlemania but in comparison with wrestlemania's 19 and 20 it wasn't as good. Anyway lets look at the card:

1. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio.

Great choice for an opener. This was a fast paced match. Not many finishers but still a good match. 8/10

2. Money in the bank ladder match.

WOW!!! That was a great ladder match. So many great spots. Banjamin and Benoit worked their ass of just for Edge to win. 9/10

3. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton.

Another good match. Randy really was working hard in that match. Undertaker is so predictable. That's why I don't like him. Still good. 8/10

4. Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

Like all womens matches it was avarage. Skip it. 5/10

5. Shawn Michels vs. Kurt Angle

HOLY S*IT!!!! Best match of the night. Both performed great. They both given 110%! Angle even tries a moonsault of the top rope!!! 10/10.

6. Piper's Pit.

Good to see Stone Cold back. Carlito comes out and talks trash and gets his ass kicked. Funny. 7/10

7. Big Show vs. Akibono

It takes them 10 minutes to start out. Than nothing special happens. Not very good. 4/10

8. JBL vs. John Cena

Bradshaw dominated here for most of the match. Than out of nowhere Cena gets momentum and wins. Again, nothing special here. 7/10

9. Triple H vs. Batista

Batista does not deserve the World title. The match was good. Their Backlash match was better though.  8/10

Overall a good wrestlemania. It adds up to about 73 out of 100. Some matches dissapoint but otherwise it's OK. Buy it for the Angle/Michels match",1125273600,,1525,4.557195571955719
2194080,5,B0006SSNXW,"I simply love how the last 2 years the WWE has made Wrestlemania a huge spectacle again.  Including the Hall of Famers, the little time fillers and the production values have made it huge like it used to be.

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero

Right before Eddie's heel turn.  The match could've been amazing if not for Rey's mask problems.  That got annoying each man looked like they were agitated too.  Still, decent opener and unique since they were tag champs and faces.  This really planted the seeds for their fued.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Kane

Shelton really comes out of this smelling like roses!  What an amazing athlete!! He's moving on to bigger and better things for sure.  Benoit, as per usual, sells an injury that I thought was real.  Typical spot fest, in a good way, that ranks high in the history of ladder matches.

Hulk Hogan, Eugene, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari

Not a match but should be counted since it took up time.  Hogan's return was priceless!!  Hearing real american again was definitely full of notalgia.  The pose in front of old glory was amazing!!  Great way to kill time.

Legend vs. Legend Killer

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

First time in a while Taker's streak was in doubt.  It's a great match that is never slow.  It really felt like 10 minutes.  The counter into the Rko was unique.  Some sloppy spots but Orton carried Taker to his best match in a long time.

Women's Championship

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

garbage.  Trish deserves better.  Should've had Booker T somewhere in here instead.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

Oh God!! Any fan worth their salt has been waiting for this for years!! We all knew it would be the match of the night.  You can't express in words just how great this match is.  This is the kind of match that real professionals put on.  Both men were amazing.

Sumo Match

Big Show vs. Akebono

I was actually interested in seeing this until they were staring at each other for almost 10 minutes!! Shouldn't be here.

WWE Championship

JBL vs. John Cena

Surprisingly dull.  Everyone knew Cena was going over.  Huge pop for the 3 count though.

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs. Batista

I was worried about this one.  I'm glad to say that it was much better than expected.  Once HHH blades himself things pick up and both men deliver a good main event.  On a side note Triple H's entrance was one of the best ever!!",1125187200,,2488,4.581235697940503

The kurt angle and hbk match is very very good

the womens match is very poor and the sumo match sucks

the undertaker vs randy orton match was my favorite with very reversals and a lot of finishers.

the pipers pit was very funny.

the wwe championship match was poor because jonh cena don't do anything and in the end he does a F-U and it ends.

The main event is pretty cool with a great entrance by triple h and a excellent match.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

A good match to open the show up with. Good wrestling with a little bit of high flying here and there makes this a good match. But because Mysterio had to check his mask after every move he or Eddie did it can get a little distracting which brings down the score a bit. Match Rating 8/10

Money In The Bank Ladder Match

Edge vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho vs.

Christian

This match was a spotfest that saw (In My Opinion) the wrong man go over. Jericho of all people should have won this match but I wanted to see Christian win this match. Everyone truly shined in this match by receiving and giving out some extreme bumps. Just Awesome. Match Rating 10/10

Legend vs. Legend Killer Match

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

This was a very solid good match that saw the right man go over (That will all change at SummerSlam though) It was good to see Cowboy Bob Orton make a little run in with the infamous cast and the Chokeslam counter into the RKO was just awesome. Good match all around. Match Rating 9/10

Women's Championship

Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus

If you're going to have women wrestle at the biggest show of the year then make sure that two good women are wrestling in a match that will be worth the fan's money. Basically this match wasn't good at all. It was just suppose to give the crowd a break before the next match. Match Rating 5/10

Interpromotional Match

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels

OMG! What a match! This is personally my favorite match of all time along with Angle vs. Benoit at Royal Rumble 2003 and Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 12 in the Iron Man Match. It started off a little slow but it picked up and became a classic. This match had everything. Brawling, Technical Wrestling, Submission Wrestling, even a table spot (Too bad it didn't break though). Amazing Match that is worth the price of this DVD alone. Match Rating 10/10

Pipers Pit With Special Guest Stone Cold Steve Austin

I expected a little more from this segment. It was funny at points but it could've been much better. Carlito coming out helped enough to do this segment justice. Another Stone Cold Beatdown. Another Stone Cold Beer Celebration. Rating 8/10

Sumo Match

Big Show vs. Akebono

Disgusting! Who wanted to see two oversized men in thongs anyway? Pretty exciting part though when the Big Show lifted Akebono. Match Rating 6/10

WWE Championship Match

John Cena vs. JBL

The hype for this match was better than the match itself! LOL.  The match was terrible for two reasons 1. JBL sucks in any match that isn't a gimmick match. 2. This match didn't have enough time. Their match at Judgment Day should've been here instead of this. But atleast Cena won and ended JBL's ridiculously long reign. Match Rating 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. Triple - H

Cool Triple - H entrance. The match was above average but not a classic at all. It was slow at points and it seemed to drag on a lot. As soon as Triple - H gets bloody is when the match starts to pick up. The post match celebration wasn't much but it did its job by closing WrestleMania with the fans happy. Match Rating 8/10

WrestleMania 21 got a 71/90 which is a 79 C (A Fair PPV). I totally agree because this show defiantly had its high points but there were too many low points in the show to give this WrestleMania a great score. In my opinion this DVD should be bought for the Angle/Michaels Match which was just a pure classic. Thanks for listening. I hope this review was helpful.",1123545600,4,4052,4.281949934123847

A good match after they have a fued starting at royal rumble after eddie gets thrown out. and juventud wins title after defeating christian. Juventud would win by using the ropes.

2. WOMANS CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH

  BRA AND PANTIES

  Torrie v Stacy (champ)

Something every one would want to see with these divas. After fueding over who is the better manager they have there first single fight at no way out. torrie wins after hitting her round the head with a frying pan unconsious and ripping her top and skirt off.

3. CRUISEWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

  INTERPROMOTIONAL LADDER MATCH.

  Rey v RVD. (champ)

A brilliant match this would be as these to people would do anyting for the title, flipping in every direction. But rey would win after rob lying rey on a table outside, then getting in the ring setting up a ladder (20ft) then doing a 5 star frog splash from the top and rey moving out the way sending rvd through the table unconsious.

 4.  TAG TEAM TITLES.

  TABLES MATCH.

  Dudleys v animal and hiendenriech (champs)

  Stone cold steve austin v hulk hogon

Austin returns as he is the best (and i am his biggest fan, and i wait anxiosly every monday hoping the glass will break.) Hulk hogan (worst wrestler ever, also known to me as 4 move man(only does punch, whip, big boot, and leg drop.)is still running wild, and these two agree to have a match, but vince hates both of these and decides not only a no dq but whoever loses leaves wwe. I think austin would win as its time for hulk to go and a what a good place to go on the biggest stage on

 of them all, deafeted by the greatest wrestler in the world. Austin would win by vince coming out and decide who he hates more. he decides austin and while both men are down he gets the ring bell and creeps up behind austin and swings at him with the bell, but austin ducks and the bell hits hulk sending him unconsious, austin then hits vince with the stunner and covers hulk for the three count.

 6. Interpromotional match

  Brock v hhh

Brock returns which seems likely, and the first match between him and hhh happens, a match which everyone has dreamed of seeing. With ric flair band from ring side, theres no way of hhh winning but out of nowhere the 3rd generation superstar randy ortan (2nd best wrestler) comes out and sets hhh for the rko, but while brock recovers behind him he turns round suddenly rkoing brock and starting a fued with him, also rejioning evolution telling hhh that he made a mistake that hhh was the man.

  NO1 CONTENDOR FOR UNDESPUITED CHAMPIONSHIP.

  INTERPROMOTIONAL HARDCORE 10 MAN ELIMINATION MATCH.

Carlito (champ) v John cena v chris beniot v booker t v big show v chris jerico v undertaker v muhammad hassan v Batista v shawn micheals.

 8. MAIN EVENT

  Elimination chamber interpromotional match

  for wwe and world heavyweight championship.

  JBL (world heavy weight champ) v Kurt angle (wwe champ)

  v randy ortan v christian v kane v edge.

This would be a amazing match as all these superstars would love to be undisputed champ as known have, after all 5 have been eliminated the man who would win would be randy ortan but by luck, as brock the man he screwed would come out after randy kurt and Jbl are the only ones left, he would run to the ring rip open the door, f5 randy through the ring, then randy escapes from under the ring runs up the ramp only to be stopped by a wall of fire and kanes entrance music, as kane was angry from randy cheating to get kane out when he was finishing every one off. with nothing else to do randy would run back down once seeing kane coming down the ramp. and with the door closed to the elimination chamber and brock coming out from under the ring, the only way out is up. so randy climbs up only to be met by the two superstars on either end. then brock connects with a f5 on the top and kane brings randy over to the edge and chokeslams him off the top through the announcers table. Then after 10 minutes of the match inside randy would start to recover and crawl underneath the ring unoticed. Then jbl would land a clothesline from hell on kurt while he was jumping off the chamber, and pin him. But then once jbl is up and turns round, randy brings up enough strength to do an rko and slowly crawl on him for the three count.

Order of elimination.

This match is only watchable for the high flying moves.

2. Money In The Bank Ladder Match

I was impressed by this match, doesn't really live up to a few past matches (TLC for WM17 is one), but the amount of talent in this match, even big man Kane does some high flying.

3. Randy Orton vs Undertaker

Very well done, probably the best match i've seen from the Undertaker at Wrestlemania since he faced Kane in 1998, where you really don't think he is going to win, because the matches from 1999-2004 were all predictable. This one wasn't.

4. Womens Championship

Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemme

Honestly i was quite impressed by Christy Hemme's effort, in her first big match, you almost expect a large worldwide audience to scare her a little, but she went out there, and put on a good match. But WWE rushed this rivalry just a tad.

5. Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle

Classic Match, i loved this match, definitely showing both superstars at their best.

Next on the card is Piper's Pit, with guest Stone Cold, this was actually pretty funny, them slapping each other in the face was really great and Piper's reaction when he was slapped was classic. Also his reaction to the What chants were also very funny.

7. Sumo Match

Akebono vs Big Show

I give them credit for effort but still, it kind of stinks.

8. WWE Championship Match

JBL vs John Cena

This match seemed very rushed, and didn't live up to what i was expecting.

2194094,3,B0006SSNXW,"This was an OK wresltemania since because of the fact that the main events weren't even worth your money. Christy vs Trish was a waste of time. John Cena vs JBL and HHH vs Batista were matches I expected more of. John Cena hit one F-U on JBL and JBl didn't kick out. Batista hit one Batista Bomb on HHH and HHH didn't kick out. I mean seriously, you could have had more then that. For some reason wrestlemania events are starting to lack something. For some reason people are looking forward to seeing HBK and Kurt Angle fight, rather then John Cena fight JBL. People are starting to look forward to the EVENTS in wrestlemania, not the MAIN EVENTS, like the ""Money in the Bank Ladder Match."" If you want to see a REAL main event worth your money, go watch the main event on wrestlemania X7, whick has rock vs stone cold.

Overall the wrestlemania wasn't that bad, with all the trailers that were funny, hall of famers, money in the bank ladder match, and hbk vs kurt Angle, it wasn't ALL that bad.",1121385600,,997,4.360215053763441

Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerereo- A very solid opener. I was very impressed. This was not there best but, it was still good. Some great chemistry between these two. This match was booked well. Rey wins. Match Rating 7

6 man money in the bank ladder match Edge vs Christian vs Shelton vs Kane vs Benoit vs Jericho- This was put toghther well and performed even better. Shelton really shines in this match and improves every time he steps into the ring. Benoit is also a great performer in this match. Even with staples in his head he still puts everything on the line for the World Heavyweight Championship contract. Edge is really the only one that didn't work good. Edge wins. Match Rating 9

Randy Orton vs Undertaker- This was a display of some more great booking and chemistry. I thought it should have been longer than it was. The interference time by Cowboy Bob Orton was great. This was Match of the night so far. Orton tries to tombstone Taker but, it gets reversed into a tombstone by Taker. Taker wins. Match Rating 9.5

Christy Hemme vs Trish Stratus Women's Title- This was another lackluster women's match but, most of them are. Nothing good here. Trish Retains. Match Rating 4

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle- Match Of the Night or possible Match Of the Year. This was another great display of Chemistry. HBK surprised Angle by giving the first 9 to 10 minutes of this match a mat based match and Michaels was out wrestling him in the early going. Then business picked up. Angle then Angle slammed Micheals into the Ring post. HBK got so close to being counted out. These two have great ring physocology. Then Michaels goes up to the top, then Angle runs up the turnbuckle and Angle Slams him off of it. Kurt goes for the cover and got a two count.

Michaels then got yelled at by Angle then gave him Sweet Chin Music. They are both down. Then Shawn jumps to his feet. The momentum is flowing then Angle grabbed his ankle out of nowhere. Then after the Ankle lock on for 1 to 2 minutes HBK taps. Match Rating 10

Akebono vs Big Show Sumo Match- There could have been a better match then this like a tag title match or something besides this garbage!? The womens match was better then this. Akebono is victorous. Match Rating 2

JBL vs John Cena Wwe Championship- I thought this match was going to be a great one. I was wrong. Horrible Booking to end it so suddenly and abruptly. Don't think that I didn't enjoy this one I did for the 9-13 minutes it lasted. JBL was going for the Clothesline from hell but, Cena ducked and the F-U connected. John Cena is the new Wwe Champion. Match Rating 6.5

Batista vs Triple H World Heavyweight Championship- This was a pretty good powerman match. Triple is a great main eventer. The duration of the match lasted 22 minutes which was a very good amount of time to give it. Ric Flair was at ringside to give Triple H a hand when the refree had his back turned. This match was very predictable. People say big man matches are not good. Take a look at this one. This is probably the best Powerman match I have seen. Batista takes the Triple for the Batista Bomb to become the new Worldheavyweight Champion Match Rating 8

WrestleMania 21 is ""A defnet buy."" I can very well agree with that. Most of the matches had good chemistry and booking while others were pretty sloppy.",1121385600,,3667,4.384955752212389

I actually really enjoyed this match while other reviewers label it as an average match. There are lots of aerial high flying moves and tons of counter moves. Great start to Wrestlemania. 9/10

Edge VS Jericho VS Benoit VS Benjamin VS Christian VS Kane-Money in the Bank Ladder Match
I've always enjoyed ladder matches but this one was one of the most vicious and brutal that I've seen in years. There are tons of injuries especially to Beniot. Only disappointing part was the end where Edge came out of nowhere and hit Beniot with the steel chair and won. 7/10

Hulk Hogan Returns
This was a nice little segment of Hulk Hogan returning to help poor Eugene from the Muhammad Hassan and Daivouri. Although Hogan is a bit of glory hog but I think he deserved it. 8/10

Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker
I could already guess that Randy was going to lose, although this was still a very interesting and exciting match-up. Orton took it right to the Undertaker although in the end the Legend killed the Legend Killer. 8/10

Crap in a nutshell. 2.5/10

Inter-Promotional Match

A Classic Battle between two of the greatest athletes ever in the wwe. This was indeed the match of the night that included awesome high flying moves, technical moves and strength moves. I totally agree with other reviewers that this match will be talked about for years to come. 10/10. Thankyou HBK & Angle

Piper's Pit
Special guest Stone Cold
This segment was quite entertaining and funny to watch. Its always great to see Stone Cold as I am a 100% stone Cold fan and above all that its great to see people like Carlito and Piper get Stunned. It wouldn't be Wrestlemania without Austin. 10/10

Sumo Match
Big Show vs. Akebono
I paid $36.95 to see 4hrs of classic wrestling not to see two huge men bump into each other to win. Although I still find it funny that Big show still has not won a match at Wrestlemania. 2/10

WWE Championship Match
John Cena vs. JBL (c)
This was the biggest disappointment of Wrestlemania 21. I was expecting a more vicious and brutal wwe title match where weapons would be used and refs taking a pounding. Instead I get a slow boring 12min + match completely dominated by JBL until Cena hits the F-U and wins. I`ve been really kind in rating this match so I gave it a six because I wanted Cena to win and he did. 6/10

World Heavyweight Championship Match
Triple H (c) vs. Batista
NOW this was a great and gruesome main event with everything that I expected from it. Triple H getting busted halfway through the match which is cool to see and Batista always having complete control over the Game. Although I do believe this main event could of used a announce table getting destroyed like last year. 8/10

So 70.5/100 is pretty much a A- that makes Wrestlemania 21 well worth the money just to see HBK vs. Angle and Batista vs. Triple H. I said that Wrestlemania 21 is better than Wrestlemania XX because I believe that last yr's mania lacked a lot of good mid-card matches compared to 21 because of the Orton vs. Taker and HBK vs. Angle really propelled this year's Wrestlemania into being an ultimate classic in my opinion as a fanatic wrestling fan.",1121385600,,3305,4.5675675675675675

1st Match

Ladder Match for the US championship

Shannon Moore vs Big Show

-Great moves by Shannon, he had to carry B.S(as in Big Show or Bull $#!t) for the whole match. Big Show tries to chokeslam Shannon but Moore counters into an RKO, and goes up the ladder to get the title. Nice opening. 5/10

2nd Match

Royal Rumble

-The WWE had a service and made a 10 man Royal Rumble match. The winner gets to face the WWE/WHW champ next week.

#1 entry was Nunzio, and he fought with JBL who was the 2nd entry. Nunzio does F-U to JBL and then he suddenly does the People's Elbow. The crowd was on their feet and the roof was coming off.

3rd entry was Eugene. Eugene comes and eliminates JBL, and than hugs Nunzio for 90 seconds. 4th entry comes who was Christian, and Christian dominates the ring by doing the un-prettier to Eugene and Nunzio. Christian eliminates Eugene, and he tries to eliminate Nunzio but Nunzio hanged on. Entry #5 comes and guess what? It was Steven Richards! Richards does a Hulk-Up Combination to Christian. And than he does the french-tickler to CLB. 6th entry was on their way, and she was Christy Hemme. Christy does a Sweet Chin Music to Richards, and then she does a Tombstone Piledriver to Christian. And when she turned around, Nunzio does a Rock Bottom to her! Nunzio eliminates Christy, and the 7th entry came.

Entry 7 was Charlie Haas, and he revealed his macho body to the whole world. He said, ""I was wearing a body-look-a-like outfit to hide my real body. The Charlie saids he is gonna kick those roody-poo. You know I can, 'cuz I'm that damn good!"" he goes in the ring and does a pedigree to Richards. He then goes to Nunzio, and tries to do Walls of Jericho, but does not connect. Instead, Nunzio stunners Haas and haas goes right over the top rope and gets him self eliminated. Nunzio then eliminates Richards, and Booker T comes as 8th entry. Booker does a scissors kick to Nunzio. Christian and Nunzio are down, so he does a spin roonie and spins like 30 times. While he was spinning, the 9th entry came, who was Paul London. Paul gets to the top of the turnbackle and boom! Does an 810 degrees splash to Booker T who was spinning, and the ring breaks. Then London eliminates Booker. And the 10th entry's music comes from the titron. Oh my gosh! Can it be?! Its Linda Mcmahon! Linda comes and tries to eliminate London but he lands on the side of the ring. Then Linda slapped London and he flew and spinned 3 times in the air and got eliminated. Linda goes to Christian and chokeslams him from hell! The ring breaks just like when Brock Lesner broke the ring when he suplexed the Big Show from the top turnbackle. Linda eliminates Christian. It was up to Linda and Nunzio now. Suddenly, Linda dashes toward Nunzio and tries to spear but Nunzio counterd by leg toe-hold and made Linda fell into the middle rope. Dial up! Because here comes the 619! Nunzio connects 619 and does a west coast pop to Linda. Linda suddenly comes up like she never was hurt, and she does a F-5 to Nunzio! Nunzio was busted open, and he looked like he wasn't breathing after he took the F-5. Linda makes Nunzio stand up, and suddenly he takes Linda's anckle and anckle lock is locked in! Linda is screaming in pain and she tappes out. Her finger breaks because she was tapping too hard. Nunzio breaks her anckle and Linda becomes unconcious. Nunzio eliminates Linda and Nunzio becomes the #1 contender. 10/10

3rd Match

Eddie Guerrerro vs Rey Mysterio

This match was very good, as time of the match was 14 minutes. Very high paced match from the beginning. What hurt was that Mysterio's mask flew off and the whole world had to know that he was bold. Eddie wins by the 3rd frog splash on Rey. 10/10

4th Match

Interpromotional Match for the World HeavyWeight Championship

Melina vs Triple H

-Triple H carried the whole match, but there was some good effort by Melina. When Triple H was going to do the pedigree(ref knocked down), Mercury and Nitro came and does snapshot. Melina goes for the cover and ref comes and does the count. 1..... 2..... th- no! Triple H kicked out! Triple H pedigreed Melina and retained the title. 5/10

5th Match

I Quit Match for the WWE championship

John Cena vs Kurt Angle

-Kurt hit John Cena on the turnbackle(not exposed) and John Cena fainted. Kurt then pinned him for the 1, 2, 3. The match was only 14 seconds, which is too short. And the only move that was in the match was Cena's one punch and Kurt's putting cena's head on the turnbackle move. 1/10

6th Match

Hell in a Cell Match by Raw

Val Venis vs Simon Dean

-This match changed the meaning of brutality. The first spotlight was when Val Venis took a ladder from under the ring, went on the top of the ladder and did a Shooting Star Press on Simon Dean! The 2nd was when they were on top of the cell. Simon did a Simon Bomb to Val Venis and the cell broke and Val went down crashing into the floor(not the rijng, but floor!). Everybody thought Val died, but he stood up just like Hulk Hogan did. But not for long, when Simon Dean jumped from the top of the cell and did a hurricane runna to Val. They went back to the ring, and Simon covered Val. Val kicked out, but it looked like he didn't have any more energy. Simon did a Simon Crasher(another one of his special moves) and the ring broke. Simon pinned Val and beated Val. Great match, as it was very fast paced from the beginning. 10/10

Overall, its 41/60, which is 64%. It wouldve been good if there wasn't the match by John Cena and Angle. I recommend a lot for the dvd because the Rumble match is very exciting, and Eddie vs Rey is a MOTY candidate, and HIAC is awesome.",1120521600,,5711,4.38957345971564

Very risky match, but Shelton put on a great show and earned my respect. Disappointing ending, but overall, a very fast paced match full of thrilling action. 8.5/10

Legend vs. Legend Killer

(Undertaker vs. Randy Orton)

One of the best matches of the night. Terrific matchup, so much hype, so much action. I was so scared Randy would win because of interference and his improbable RKO. Great match, I recommend this match to anybody. 10/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

A Battle for the Ages. Great match. The better man won. Shawn Michaels gave it his all, his Show Stopper move from turnbuckle, low blow, sweet chin music, usage of table. Kurt Angle just used his great wrestling skills and proved he DOESN'T suck at wrestling. 10/10

Big Show vs. Akebono

This sumo match was less than 2 minutes. The entrances were unbearably long and seeing Big Show without his robe on and just underwear nearly blinded me. It ended with Akebono throwing Big Show out of the circle to get the victory.

2/10

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

I really expected Christy to win, but when you watch carefully, the ending is REALLY bad. Christy falls back way before the Chick Kick is made, which makes me give it a HORRIBLE rating. 1/10

Piper's pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin

Great to see Roddy Piper and Stone Cold. Carlito was certainly a suprise. Great time watching, funny insults, the teamup on Carlito amused me. Stone Cold stuns everybody, great time. 8/10

WWE Championship match: John Cena vs. JBL

Probably the worst match in JBL's career. JBL is COMPLETELY dominating and suddenly starts losing and loses. It's odd how WWE is planned, JBL ALWAYS TAKES OUT HIS CABINET, but for some reason, on Wrestlemania 21, he doesn't. Badly planned Vince McMahon, this match reminds me of Big Show vs John Cena last year in Wrestlemania. JBL/Big Show dominating then Cena suddenly wins. 4/10

World Heavyweight Championship match: Triple H vs. Batista

To tell you honestly, a 1 on 1 isn't worthy of a main event. Flair had a big role, but it wasn't good. Triple H actually nearly beat Batista without cheating in the beginning.. and that is VERY inprobably because Batista is much better. Obvious ending, I liked Undertaker vs Randy Orton more, believe it or not. 7/10

This match was ok as both wrestlers battled each other in a mexican style. The match was mostly in favour of guerrero as he was taking the advantage by giving two three amigoes to rey, but then eddie missed a frog spalsh. rey was able to connect the 619 which gave him the victory. 7.5/10

6-man money in the bank ladder match

This was the third best match in my opinion. In the beginning all of them jumped on kane and attacked him which made him exhausted. Shelton Benjamin showed great athleticism and chris benoit was very impressive as he was battling with one arm after kane had damaged the other. But in the end edge climbed the ladder after delivering a cheap shot to the injured arm of chris benoit. 8.5/10

legend vs. legend killer

(undertaker vs. randy orton)

This was a great match which made the undertaker go 13-0 at wrestlemania21. Orton tried everything to beat the dead man but it wasn't enough to bring him down. Even his father Bob Orton interfiered in the match. But it was the very deadly Tombstone piledriver that finished Orton off. 8/10

shawn michaels vs. kurt angle

This was the second best match of Wrestlemania 21 as both wrestlers were impressive and showing so many great moves.

Both of them battled very hard for the victory. HBK was able to kick out of a few ankle locks and he delivered a sweet chin music to kurt angle, but he pinned him after almost 10 seconds and angle kicked out. In the end HBK had no choice but to yap out to the ankle lock. 10/10

This sumo match was less than 30 seconds and it ended with Akebono throwing Big Show out of the circle to get the victory.

This match was pretty simple and quick as Tris Stratus who is more experienced got the victory. 5.5/10

Piper's pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin

It was nice to see the return of the texas rattle snake at piper's pit. I liked the end after he stunned carlito, he stunned piper as well. 6/10

WWE Championship match: John Cena vs. JBL

This was a good match as John Cena survived a superplex and battled out of JBL's moves. Many people thought that it was JBL who was going to win but John Cena got the advantage and gave his 5 knuckle shuffle. After that he got the victory by delivering an F-U. 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship match: Tiple H vs. Batista

This was the best match of Wrestlemania and it was the main event. Batista proved thet his stay on Raw was the right thing to do. Triple H tried for many times to give the pedigree and failed. He even tried to give the pedigree to Batista on the steel steps, but Batista reversed it and The Game's head hit the steel post and his face was busted wide open. In the end after delivering some spinebusters, Batista finished the Game off with a strong Batista Bomb. 10/10",1120348800,,2820,4.3865384615384615

The 6 Man Money in the Bank Ladder match began. Edge, Christian, Shelton, Y2J, Benoit all came and tried to attack Kane as he strolled to the ring. The match was exciting! Most of the match Edge was out of the ring on the mat. Kane was crushing Benoit's arm with a ladder, forcing Benoit to go through the rest of the match with a very injured left arm. Benoit was too close at reaching the breifcase was Edge knocked him down and won it. Big upset.

Eugene was in the ring.""I can't beleive I'm at WM21...."" blah blah. Muhammad and his valentine came out,beat him up, complained. And the legendary, immortal Hulk Hogan came out to save Eugene!!!

Legand vs Legend Killer

Undertaker vs. RKO. Orton was impressive. He tried to give UT his RKO a few times. But did pull it off. Randy's legend father Cowboy Bob Orton Jr. made an appearance with the infamous cast. He whacked UT in face giving his son the opportunity to make history by ending UT's winning streak at WM, but he gave Randy the 2 count. Thw match went on. Randy using his quick wit, and some what experience to attempt to give the UT a Piledriver but UT reversed it and gave it to Randy. :( 1-2-3. UT 13-0 at WreslteMania.

Womens Championship

Trish vs Christy Hemme

Christy really tried in this match. Kicking down Trish several times! Trish was controlling through a majority of the match. But poor Christy went out with just a chick kick. Trish is the winner. Why doesn't she have a fued with Maria or Stacy?! Someone she could beat.

HBK vs Kurt Angle

Very good match! Kurt Angle got his ankle lock on a few times. HBK nailed hime with the SCM. Shawn tried his hardest to pull through, and not tap out to the ankle lock for the last time. There was no chance of him making it to the ropes. He tried for a couple of minutes. But HBK tapped. Kurt was victorious at WM21.

Piper's Pit with SCSA.

Interesting. We have two of the most controversial men in history of WWE. Appearently to SCSA Piper isn't tough. Carlito came out to beat on Piper, SCSA beat on Carlito. Piper and SCSA had beer, SCSA gave Piper the stunner.

Theres not much to say about the Sumu match. Big Show vs Akebono. Akebono won of course. Big Shows lost @ EVERY WM he's been in.

WWE Championship

JBL vs John Cena

Cena has new music called ""My Time is Now."" This one of Cena's best matches!! Punches were hit, kicks, clothelines, everything went down in this match. John Cena hit JbL with the FU to become the NEW WWE Champion!! :)

The Hall of Fame class of 2005 came out, each with a Diva on an arm. Orton came out with Maria, Orndorff with Miss Jackie, Hogan with Stacy, Hart with Joy, Iron Sheik with Candice, Piper with Torrie,Volkoff with Michelle.

World Championship

Triple H vs. Batista

The Animal was literally unleashed. Batista was in control for almost all of the match. HHH did manage to give the pedigree the Batista. But Batista nailed Triple H with the Batista Bomb. 1-2-3. 3 seconds and Batista became the World Champion. The highlight of his career.

This WM21 dvd package comes with all 9 parody trailers including bloopers and outakes. Has WM Week Activities, Motorhead with HHH, The Battle Royal and much more!",1120348800,,3353,4.429967426710098

Orton tried to end takers win streak at Wrestlemania. He had his father Cowboy Bob Orton try to help. Taker countered a tombstone and hit one of his own for the win.

2194110,5,B0006SSNXW,"This is the best Wrestlemania so far. This Wrestlemania or Wrestlemania X-Seven is one of the best one's so far. There were so many classic matches here and some matches that I will never forget when I get older. Here are the matches.

World Wrestling Entertainment Presents Wrestlemania 21

April 3, 2005

Staples Center

Los Angeles, California

1) Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero

Tag Team Champion vs. Tag Team Champion

This match was a great opener. It was a classic match for the ages. A lot of high flying moves and lots of anticipation in this match. In the end, Rey got a 619 and tried to get the West Coast Pop, but Eddie reversed it and got a powerbomb pin for the two count. Then Rey Mysterio rolled Eddie up for the pin and got a three count on him. WINNER: Rey Mysterio 8/10

2) Edge vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian

Money In The Bank Ladder Match

This is a Ladder Match to end all Ladder Matches. There were lots of high flying moves. I wanted Shelton Benjamin to win the match but he lost. In the end, Benoit was so close to getting the briefcase, but Edge hit Benoit with a chair to his injured arm and lost the match. WINNER: Edge 9/10

3) Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Legend vs. Legend Killer

Randy Orton wanted to prove something here, but didn't. This match was pretty good, not my favorite though. There was lots of good moves by both Undertaker and Randy Orton. It was pretty cheap when Randy Orton have to bring his dad to help him beat The Undertaker and still didn't. In the end, Randy Orton got The Undertaker with the RKO and Randy Orton tried to get the Tombstone Piledriver, but Undertaker reversed it and won the match and made it 13-0. WINNER: Undertaker 7/10

4) Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

Women's Championship

This match was probably a waste of time. All the match was about was Trish's jealousy. Christy got some good moves and even a Twist of Fate, but it only worked for a two count. In the end, Trish got a Chick Kick on Christy and retained the Title. WINNER: Trish Stratus 3/10

5) Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels

Inter-Promotional Match

This was the best match on the card and a match that I will never forget. Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels both put delivering moves on each other. There were a lot of special move opportunities and lots of special's given. The best move by Shawn Michaels was when he jumped off the rope onto Kurt Angle on the table. Kurt Angle's best move was when he Angle Slammed Shawn Michaels into the steel ring post. In the end, Kurt Angle gave Shawn Michaels the deadly Ankle Lock and Shawn just had to tap out. A match that I will never forget. WINNER: Kurt Angle 10/10

6) Piper's Pit w/ Stone Cold

This was not bad, it was pretty good to see the Rattlesnake back. Nothing much to say about it. Carlito came to the ring during the Pit. Austin stunned Piper and Carlito. 5/10

7) Big Show vs. Akebono

Sumo Match

This was funny to watch two fat people just beat the crap out of eachother. It was a first and it was pretty good. WINNER: Akebono 6/10

8) John Cena vs. JBL

WWE Championship

This was a pretty awesome match. When I was watching it, I was so worried because I thought that John Cena was going to lose, but ended up winning the match. There were lots of great moves on both of the superstars. In the end, John Cena gave the F-U to JBL and won the match. I have to give it a 9.5 because that it was too short, but very entertaining. WINNER: John Cena 9.5/10

9) Triple H vs. Batista

World Heavyweight Championship

This was a very entertaining match between the two superstars. Batista had to prove something and he had done that in this match by defeating Triple H and winning the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H bled quickly and both superstars got a lot of moves on one another. In the end, Batista put his thumbs down and got the Batista Bomb on him. Batista has made Wrestlemania History. WINNER: Batista 10/10

There were many great Wrestlemania moments including Hulk Hogan coming back. But, overall I give the Pay Per View a 67.5/90 which equals to 75%. This was probably the best Wrestlemania by far.",1119830400,,4157,4.423127463863338

the best match match The dead man had since his return to his old gimmick.a very good match 7/10

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn michaels

Christy Hemme vs Trish Stratus:well you have the quenn of women's wrestling and a sloppy redhair who doesn't even know how to do a headlock.what would you expect.however this turned out to be watchable 4.5/10

Big Show vs. Akebono(sumo match)
no reason to see this.it's a waste of time 0/10

2194112,4,B0006SSNXW,"I was more excited about WM 20, mostly for Angle/Guerrero and Benoit/HHH/HBK, but all in all, i think this was the better show.

Eddie vs. Rey

 Well, I'll say this: they wrestled the right stlye match for the way it was booked. Made the feud work better in the end. But, i was pretty disappointed in this match. Not a bad match by any ruling stick, but it was sloppy compaired to their match at Halloween Havoc, an all time classic. Some good psycholigy and a nice build make up for some botched spots and overall sloppiness. Oh, and Wrestlemania was in LA, so do you think the boys got a nice lil response? 3.5/5

Y2J vs. Christian vs. Benjamin vs. Edge vs. Kane vs. Benoit

 Maybe I'm too hard on this match. I just think it wasn't used to push the wrestlers at all, just to push the title, and I'm a fan of WRESTLING MATCHES. As a match, might as well give it 2.5, but for spot fu it'd be a logical 4.5, which leaves me with the conclusion: 3.5

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

 Something just told me that this match was gonna exceed expectations. In my predictions, i missed one match, and it was this one. With the crowd FINALLY digging into Orton, he seemed in his mode, which is a very good thing. I swear he's gonna rule our world in a few years. UT had his best match since coming back with his old gimmick. On the level of HHH/Undertaker at WM 17.: 3.75

Trish vs. Christy

 Oh boy, the goddess of female wrestling vs. ... well, a random Juggie who doesn't COMPLETELY suck at wrestling. what you'd imagine. 1/5

HBK vs. Kurt Angle

 Lived up to and exceeded most everyone's expectations. Some people have their little complaints about this match (""it started too slow,"" or ""Brian Hebner counted too slow"") but that's what they are: little. As for what went on in the ring, you've got 2 of the very best of our time in a ring for 30 minutes, no interference, and a great crowd to root them on. I will go as far as saying it is one of the 3 best WWE matches in the past 10 years (3. this, 2. HHH vs. Cactus Jack Street fight 2k, and 1. Stone Cold vs. Bret Hart WM 13). The rematch is this sunday and is a street fight, should be a MOTYC, but to say it will reach this match's greatness is unlikely.

John Cena vs. JBL

 Eugh. I can't watch this match. It's pathetic, Cena won the title which he holds(now) with such power in such an underwhelming way. The fued to this match worked very well, but obviously both are lacking in the ring. After this match, though, the feud picked up fire and they had a low end MOTYC I Quit rematch at Judgement Day. Can't compare those two matches at all. 1.5/5 (Judgement Day match: 4 stars.)

Batista vs. HHH

 I don't care for this match, this feud, or half of this match too much. And that half isn't HHH. But, this match worked as a send off for a lame feud, and a throwtogether main event. Had some good spots, including a rediculous blad job from Trips. Nothing spectacular. Since his win, Batista has obviously lost some of his star power and I can only pray that his run is ended by Edge or even Cena, now that they are on the same show. (Temporarily) 2.5/5",1119484800,,3105,4.237691001697793
2194113,5,B0006SSNXW,"wrestlemania 21 was top five in my book because every match had some sort of storyline. there weren't any matches added to make it longer. the best matches had to be the money in the bank ladder match, undertaker vs randy orton, kurt angle vs shawn michaels. the title matches were also very good except the cena jbl match was too short because they were both told that they had to shorten it. the whole show is awsome especially pipers pit which is pretty funny. i suggest this dvd to any wrestling fan.",1119484800,,504,4.43010752688172
2194114,3,B0006SSNXW,"The 21th edition of the biggest PPV of the year, and I was very disappointed. I think this is a ""got-to-have"" if you like me have all the other 20 shows. I wouldnt recommend it for new fans, only really dying-heart WWE fans. With the exeption of the Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Guerrero match and the Main Event, there wasn't really any match i was looking forward to, cause WWE have done a really poor job of hyping up the other matches.

Well, the DVD box, contains 3 disks, disk 1 & 2 are the wrestlemania show, and the 3rd disk is the whole Hall of Fame caramony, and of cause all the ""Hollywood Parody's"" they did up to the WM21.

1. Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Guerrero - A good match, both Wrestlers are among the ""BEST"" technical wrestlers in the world, and I have always enjoy Rey's highflying and fast wrestling style. A great opener for WM.

**** (4 stars)

2. Chris Jericho Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Kane Vs. Christian Vs. Edge Vs. Chris Benoit (Ladder match) - The winner of this ""Money in the Bank"" ladder match gets a shot at the World title! The idea was good, but the wrestling was bad, exept for some suicide moves from Benoit and Shelton this match was pretty boring. The old TLC matches is just so much better than this one.

** (2 stars)

3. Randy Orton Vs. Undertaker - Well, Undertaker is 12-0 before this match against Randy Orton. The selfproclaimed Legend Killer is up against one of the biggest legends of them all.  The build up for this match was very poor and i didn't have any expetations for it, but it was ok. Undertaker outperformed Randy Orton in style and atletisism.

***+ (3 stars)

4. Trish Stratus Vs. Christy - Buuuh huu and wraaah wraaah. Get some real wrestlers in the ring please, Lita, Victoria or Molly but not these 2. Having 2 playboy models in the ring might be entertaining for some, but thats a whole other show on a different channel :P

* (1 star)

4. Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels - Probaly the best match in this years WM. The Build up was great, and the fact that they are still feuding 4 months after the show, just shows how much these wrestlers hates eachother. The Match is great, both Kurt and Shawn gives 110% and the result is some really good wrestling that can be watched over and over again.

****+ (4 star)

5. Big Show vs Akebono - I know that Big Show is big, but put him in a Sumo match is ridicoulus, and the result is just a disgrase for the WM21. I wanna watch wrestling, not Sumo-wrestling.

* (1 star)

6. JBL Vs. John Cena (WWE Championship) - Well I didn't have any expetations to this match, and man was I glad i didnt. Cause this was a very poor match. JBL is just plain horrible in this, Cena has his moments in the match, but as a Championship match it was very bad.

** (2 stars)

7. HHH Vs. Batista (World Heavyweight Championship) - Once Batista was HHH's pet, but the animal evolved and the result was a great build up for this great match. Man was i tired of watching HHH carrying around that title, so it was a realease when Batista raised his hands as the rightfull winner. Not the best techical wrestling, but some terrific hard wrestling. I love to see spinebusters, powerbombs and suplex's with some muscles behind them.

**** (4 stars)

..... Overall one of the badest WM's i have ever seen, but i really wasn't suprised since WWE haven't produced any good PPV's in 2 years and that was WM19. I really miss WCW and Sting.

The first 2 disks are the Wrestlemania show, the last is the entire hall of Fame ceremony. Also included is all the GREAT movie parodys commericals they did leading up the WM. The show is about 3 stars, but the extra DVD and low price knocks it up to 4.

1. Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Guerrero - A really good match. Alot of people don't like it but I think the expectation were too high on this one. I thought it was a great opener! Guerrero and Mysterio are tag tea partners competing in a match to see who's better. ***1/2

WRESTLEMANIA 21:

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio: 7/10

This match wasn't too bad and I didn't really expect anything amazing from it. A good opener.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane: 7.5/10

To be honest I expected more from this. There were some good spots but i felt they could have done more moves with the ladders. A good match.

Hulk Hogan's Return: 8/10

One of my favourite moments of the night. The crowd were really into it. Great stuff.

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton: 7/10

This match was good. It got kind of predictable but not a bad match.

WWE Women's Title Match

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme: 3.5/10

The usual boring women's match. Nothing special here.

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels: 9.5/10

Amazing match, the best by far. Probably the only match of the night that felt like a wrestlemania match. This had great high-flying spots by both men. Superb.

Piper's Pit featuring ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin: 5/10

Yes it was good to see Austin but this dragged on a little too long i think. It was entertaining.

Sumo Match

The Big Show vs. Akebono: 1/10

I paid to see WRESTLING not a stupid sumo match. This was so stupid and boring. I was waiting for big show to go crazy and choke slam him through the ring but it didn't happen.

WWE Title Match

John Bradshaw Layfield vs. John Cena: 5/10

This was smackdown's main event for wrestlemania? A big disappointment. These men have had much better matches on smackdown. Nothing special about the match, no good spots and it was very short.

World Title Match

Triple H vs. Batista: 7.5/10

Very poor for a wrestlemania main event. I expected so much more. It was a good match but i felt the ending was too sudden. Batista did his finisher and that was it. In the HBK match there were loads of kick outs and the ending was great, but not here.

SCORE: 61/100

According to the key i have rated this PPV as 'good, it is a satisfying PPV and perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. I agree with this. I expected so much more from wrestlemania. Don't listen to these stupid kids on amazon that have been watching wrestling for a few moneths and saying 'this iz d best wrestlemania eva!!!'

1. Eddie Gurerreo vs. Rey Mysterio

This was a good choice for a opener. I don't know why everyone hated this match? Rey and Eddie put on a match as only SD wrestlers can. My favorite spot was when Eddie countered The 619 into a powerbomb, I was like OMG! But Mysterio won the match after a roll-up. Eddie should've won IMO. 9/10

2. Money In The Bank Ladder Match

Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjiman vs. Kane

This was one of the best ladder match in WWE history. All six men did their best in this match. Shelton Benjiman was the best in this contest. Kane wasn't to sharp in the match, I thought he would've dominated this match because of his power. I think the wrong man won IMO. It should've been Kane or Y2J, but it was Edge who got the suitcase. 10/10

2. Randy Orton vs. Undertaker

To be honest, I was really surprised this match went so well. Orton was at his best in this match. He really made Taker put out 100%. I thought Orton would gain the win after he countered the chockslam into a RKO. But Taker kicks out of it and beats Orton with a tombstone. Like someone said before, if anyone deserved to end Taker striek, it should've been Orton. 9/10

3. Women's Championship

Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus(champ)

This was a okay. It's skippable if your not into women matches. Trish look hot(as always).And Christy was being her red-headed self. 5/10

5. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Micheals

This was the most anticipated match in the card, and it lived up to the hype. The match started off slow with some technical moves. Then it went into action and high flying moves(from Micheals).Then the paced picked up when Angle hit his top-rope Angle Slam. Angle wins after making Micheals tap out to the Ankle Lock. 10/10

6. Sumo Match

Big Show vs. Akebono

This match was sooooooooo gay. Watching both men wrestle in thongs-like thights. I suggest you skip it. 1/10(for Big Show having the balls to come out in that thong-like thights)

7. WWE Championship

John Cena vs. JBL(champ)

This was a ok match. JBL and Cena could've done better. I agree with everyone else that this was the worst SD main-event at WM. JBL dominates most of the matchup, and Cena out of nowhere wins with a FU. 7.5/10

8. World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. Triple H(champ)

This was not the best main-event, but wasn't the worst either. I didn't find this match interesting except for Triple H bleeding, and Flair's interfearence. Batista moves didn't change at all. Batista win and becomes the new WHC. But how many times Triple H is going to be in the main-event? Overall this was a ok match. 8.5/10",1118361600,3,2697,4.496919917864476

2194121,2,B0006SSNXW,"I'm being generous giving this even 2 stars.

1. Guerrero v. Mysterio - (4/10) Extremely sloppy opener. I expected soo much more from these two. They've had excellent matches on Smackdown, but for whatever reason, they couldn't translate that success in this match. And it was extremely annoying b/c Rey was constantly adjusted his mask.

2. Money in the Bank - (9/10) Everyone can agree on this match. All the participants worked very hard. Great spot by Benjamin. But I feel they held back just a little. I was hoping for a few more spots in this one.

3. Orton v. Taker - (7.5/10) Good match, but nothing spectacular. I was suprised by the ending, I thought Orton would win. It was cool to see pops interfere, and then the attempted tombstone by Orton that came up short.

4. Michaels v. Angle - (8/10) Extremely overrated match. Started extremely slow. Some cool spots, things would finally pick up, but I don't want to see a match of this caliber end in a submission. Angle should've went all out and won with a shooting star press. I'll take Angle's hair match against Edge at Judgement Day over this one.

5. Big Show v. Akebono - (1/10) What a waste of time. They couldn't fit in a cruiserweight match, but they had plenty of time for this garbage. I understand that they need some comedy relief, but this was just plain weak.

6. JBL v. Cena - (5/10) Worst Wrestlemania championship match ever? Boring match throughout, then it ended with an FU from out of nowehere. These two have had entertaining matches on Smackdown as well as other PPV's, I just think this one was poorly booked.

7. HHH v. Batista - (6/10) Another snoozefest. It was obvious Batista would win. This was as bad as HHH v. Jericho at Wrestlemania X8. Nothing spectacular here, but it's always to see a new champ crowned at the biggest event of the year.

8. Piper's Pit - (7/10) I'm not a big Piper fan, it was nice to Austin again, but Carlito stole this segment. Now this was cool.

9. Hogan's return - (5/10) Why are people making a big deal here? Its not like he's been gone 5 years. It was funny how he milked the ovation when he was walking back up the ramp, the applause was dying down, but he still wouldn't leave.

I guess so far, every Wrestlemania will always pale in comparison to X7. Wait a few months once the hoopla to die, and the price will certainly drop",1118016000,3,2351,4.446511627906977

Money in the Bank Ladder Match

Jericho vs. Benoit vs. Benjamin vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Kane

this is an amazing match. lots of high flying action with ladders. but in the match at one point Kane is gone (knocked out) for a very long time. not like Kane there. great match. Edge wins. (9/10 where's Kane)

Legend vs Legend Killer (Undertaker vs. Randy Orton)

a pretty great match and story line to it. Orton in the match will look like he will win but the Deadman comes through to win this great match. (9/10)

Women's Title Match

Trish (C) vs. Christy

this match is so boring. the wrestling is horrible. but the good part was Christy (she is hot). (1/10 for Christy)

Michaels vs. Angle

this is an ok match. above average. it is pretty entertaining. Angle wins. (6/10)

Sumo Match

 An awesome Wrestlemania 21 trailer(Gladiator parody) opens the show with Steve Austin.

Raw vs Smackdown Battle Royal(Raw: Viscera, Maven, Tajiri, Rhyno, Hurricane, Rosey, William Regal, Simon Dean, Gene Snitsky, Chris Masters, Val Venis, Tyson Tomko, Sylvan Greiner & Rob Conway; Smackdown: Spike Dudley, Luther Reigns, Charlie Haas, Hardcore Holly, Billy Kidman, Mark Jindrak, Paul London, Orlando Jordan, Danny Basham, Doug Basham, Booker T, Scotty 2 Hotty, Funaki, Nunzio, Akio & Heidenreich) 8/10- this should have been on the ppv instead of Heat. a great concept to get all the guys involved who didn't have a match. starts off funny with interaction between Hurricane & Heidenreich. Eric Bischoff & Theodore Long accompany their guys to the ring. a lot of suprises in this one. 29 guys in the ring at one time. an old school idea that still works.

Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero 9.5/10- a great choice to kick off the show. these 2 put on a clinic on how to do a great match. unfortunately, the half dead crowd hurt this one. it has a surprise ending.

Raw meets Smackdown moment backstage with JBL, The Cabinet & Evolution.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match( winner gets the briefcase with a contract for a World Title match)

Chris Jericho vs Edge vs Shelton Benjamin vs Christian vs Chris Benoit vs Kane 10/10- 1st time ever. a new concept introduced by Jericho. this is the match of the year so far. this wil have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Tyson Tomko tries to get involved. this needs to be an annual event at Wrestlemania.

a great in ring segment with Eugene, Muhammad Hassan, Khosrow Daiviri & Hulk Hogan.

Randy Orton vs Undertaker 8.5/10- the legend meets the legend killer in a Raw vs Smackdown match. this one starts off slow but picks up as the match goes along. Cowboy Bob Orton makes an appearance.

WWE Women's Championship

Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemme 4/10- what a waste of time. this does not belong at Wrestlemania. should have been on Heat. Hemme does not know how to wrestle. she needs more training. is this the best the women's division has to offer? Lita is in Christy's corner.

Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels 10/10- a Raw vs Smackdown match. this definitely lives up to the hype. it combines old school mat wrestling with modern day moves. this is a match of the year candidate too.

Wrestlemania Movie Trailer(Basic Instinct Parody)- this one stars Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Christian, Stacy Keibler, Fabalous Moolah & Mae Young. hiliriously funny.

Piper's Pit(hosted by Roddy Piper)(guest: Steve Austin). it is great to see Piper return. the meeting between these 2 is classic. Carlito Carribean Cool also shows up.

Wrestlemania Movie Trailer(Taxi Driver Parody)- this one is funny as well. stars Bautista, Big Show , Heidenreich, Shawn Michaels & others.

Sumo Match

Akebono vs Big Show 4.5/10- terrible & boring. i don't like sumo wrestling. Show is out of his element here. should have been done on Smackdown.

WWE Championship

John Bradshaw Layfield vs John Cena 5/10- this was very disappointing. it didn't even come close to the buildup & hype it received. the match was way too short & not even intense. Cena has to be the laziest worker in WWE. JBL carries him the whole match. this could have been a lot better. sorry ending to the match.

WWE Hall Of Fame Class Of 2005(Nikolai Volkoff, Iron Sheik, Paul Orndorff, Cowboy Bob Orton, Jimmy Hart, Roddy Piper & Hulk Hogan)- a great opportunity to introduce them to the crowd.

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple HHH vs Batista 9/10- a pretty good match between these 2. Batista holds up better than i thought he would. Ric Flair gets involved. HHH has to carry the Animal through some parts of the match. a great ending.

the extras are excellent including all the Wrestlemania movie trailers.there is a whole disc with the WWE Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony in its entirety. a must see for any fan, young or old.

Tag Team Division: WWE sucks at tag team division now. All of the good tag teams(APA(Faaroq realeased, Bradsaw is now JBL), Hardy Boys(Matt was released, goin to TNA hopefully, and Jeff is in TNA), Edge and Christian(are on the same show, but go completly different paths), Dudley Boys(injured from the Big Show), World's Greatest Tag Team(seperated cause of the draft)) are gone. WWE has The Bashams(suck), MNM(what is this, they are horrible, they only win cause Melina always interfears), Heart Throbs(horrible ), Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas(bad combination), and Tajiri and Regal(bring back Eugene please), all of these tag teams are horrible.

The TNA tag team division is awsome. They have America's Most Wanted,The Naturals, Team Canada, 3 Live Kru, Phil Delta Slam, Disciples of Destruction, and others.

Cruiserweight Division: In WWE it's getting weaker. Rey Mysterio competes with the heavyweights now, Chavo sucks, Kidman sucks, Ultimo Dragon was released, Akio has always sucked, Spike Dudley is hardly competing, Shanon Moore has a horrible character(prince of punk), Funaki and Paul London are ok. Soon former TNA superstar Kazarian will shine light in the cruiserweight divion in WWE, showing them how TNA does it.

In TNA the X Division(cruiserweights) are awesome. You got AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels, Primetime Elix Skipper, Chris Sabin, Michael Shane, Shocker, Jerry Lynn(coming back in the summer), Sean Waltman, Jeff Hardy(suspened for showing up late) and Zack Gowen(former WWE cruiserweight)

Women Division: In WWE, the Women's champion is out of action(Trish Stratus). Lita can't compete and is now hated by the fans. Stacy Keibler is just a model for WWE, as well as Torrie, Dawn, Jackie, Joy, Christy, Marrie and others. The others were released for example Victoria.

In TNA theirs only two women, but their hott.

Heavyweight Division: Both WWE and TNA are strong in the heavyweight division. Raven got suspended in TNA for using a staple gun in the House of Fun match. It' hard to see who's the better company in the heavyweight division.",1117324800,,2154,5.226086956521739

Eddie Guerrero v. Rey Mysterio

This match was pretty good.  Don't expect a Halloween Havoc 97 repeat.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match

As a long time Jericho fan, I feel he is being screwed out of his right to be champion.  As of now, he is currently going under a heel change and expect him to be in the title hunt.  This match was very good.  Shelton Benjamin definitely stole this match.  Benoit did a very good job of selling the arm injury.  Too bad WWE let that backturning Edge win.  Edge screwed matt people.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio -

A fantastic underrated opener, Eddie and Rey completely surprised me with their perfect reversals and near falls and sets up Guerrero`s heel turn perfectly, its always hard to pull off a face vs. face match but Guerrero and Rey did it beautifully - 8/10

Money in the Bank Ladder Match - Winner gets a contract that gives them a World title shot that lasts up to a year -

Thoroughly excellent, this match delivered bump after intense bump, of non-stop mayhem, Benoit (who after what looked like breaking his arm, did a DIVING HEADBUTT OFF A LADDER to Kane) and Benjamin (who RAN UP A LADDER and clotheslined Jericho off it!) both delivered stellar performances, Kane was in typical ""monster mode"" and Jericho and Christian both were great as usual, Edge was average and didn't seem to do much more than the ending.... - 9/10

Funny intermission involving Eugene who seemed REAL excited to be at Mania and provided some laughs, which was then ruined by the awful Hassan and his lil' rambler Davari beating him up before OH MY GOD ALMIGHTY, ITS HULK HOGAN BWAAAH! So the crowd cheered, and Hulk kicked Hassan's and Davari's asses and people are all excited and Hulk Hogan breaks into his VERY long posing routine and I die a little more inside...(sorry, I'm no ""Hulkamaniac"")

Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker -

Great storyline leading up to this match about the deadman's winning streak, good ol' Taker delivered another great performance and Orton finally seem's to have escaped the baby face slump he was in and now as a fully fledged heel performed excellently with a shoulder injury, some great near falls and reversal's (choke slam into RKO? INCREDIBLE!), it had a fairly slow start though and really should have been a gimmick match (Casket or HIAC),good seeing Taker coming out on top though (I was ready to stop watching WWE programming if they chose to end Taker's undefeated streak with of all people, Randy Orton) - 8/10

Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus - Women's Championship Match -

The beautiful Trish carry's the horribly green Christy (my god, the women's division in the WWE is practically dead if this is the best baby face women's wrestler they can get)through an actually okay match but in the end Trishalicous beat Christy clean with a swift kick - 6/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle -

Man, HBK and Angle are fantastic, what more could you ask for from the two greatest performers of our generation! Intensity fuelled, amazing high flying (HBK did a moonsault to Angle on the announcers table!) technical showcase, this was a blast to watch, it started out Old School as both HBK and Angle applied holds to each other and tried to fight out of them, then it slowly turned to the WWE of today, with each wrestler throwing just about every move in the book at each other, with reversal after near fall after reversal, it was simply poetry in wrestling motion, amazingly paced and both men performed so brilliantly its hard to believe their ages, in a word, AWESOME! (especially seeing the Angle Slam from the top rope!) - 10/10

Akebono vs. Big Show - Sumo Match -

This was...okay, look let's be honest the ""biggest match in Wrestlemania history"" (Good lord, Tazz and Michael Cole are idiots) never was going to be showstopper (more like a slowslower, or a snoresnorer considering I found it hard to stay awake during those awful promos for this match on Smackdown!) but it was competitive for a...sumo match, even though Show lost (I'm speechless really) - 5/10

PIPER'S PIT, WITH SPECAIL GUEST STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN: Hell Yeah! First minutes between the Hot Rod and the Texas Rattlesnake were awesome and then the frankly brilliant Carlito came out to tell the two that they were not ""cool"", getting a stunner for his troubles, then Piper and Austin pop open a few cold one's and Roddy gets ""stunned""!

John Cena vs. JBL - WWE Championship Match -

JBL who after holding the WWE championship for 10 months (in my opinion, a underated heel champ, wrestling god reign) and beating top guys; Eddie, Undertaker, Angle, Big Show, Booker T and more in the most brutal, long, bloody encounters in recent memory, loses the title in 12 minutes to John Cena in an awful match, with no near falls, one reversal (count em' ONE ) I realise they had to cut down the match time because of the (boring) hall of fame ceremony, but come on! If there was one match on the card practically crying out for a gimmick stipulation this was it, this was one sided garbage, barely acceptable on Smackdown! Let alone on the grandest stage of them all at Wrestlemania, the disappointment of the year (hopefully, they'll make up for it at Judgement day with their ""I Quit"" match) - 3/10

HALL OF FAME INTERMISSION: Uh yeah, this covers the ah..... Hall of Fame induction ceremony that took place the day before Mania and then it brings out all of the guys out on the main stage who all get silence except *sigh* Hogan! Still though it's a nice way to calm your nerve's after that rubbish performance by John Cena and JBL, but it only increases your hunger for....

THE MAIN EVENT: Batista vs. Triple H - World Heavyweight Championship Match -

Feeding off their fantastically intense storyline they had on RAW, Triple H did what many thought was impossible, he carried Dave Batista through a fantastic match that went over 20 mins, filled with power moves from The Animal but crucially proper offence from the Game as well it managed to be absolutely blinding, although it didn't hide Batista's weaknesses he more than made up for it (and unlike Goldberg he seems to know the timing of his move's right) in an absolutely mind blowing finish (The look on The Game's face and reaction from the crowd as Batista powers out of the Pedigree is incredible) the crowd was into it too, showing no matter how Batista fares as the World champ he's definitely over with the fans- 9/10

Now WWE get down to releasing that Kurt Angle DVD, I mean if you can make one for (dear GOD) John Cena, then surely you can make one for our Olympic HERO, just make sure you include all the matches people have said and the build up rivalry video's for his main event feuds!

Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero 9/10 Great opening match

6 man ladder match Kane vs Edge vs Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Benoit vs Christan 10/10 Excellent match that has to be seen to be believed.

Randy Orton vs Undertaker 8/10 Very good match between these two. Timely run in by Cowboy Bob Orton. Orton proves himself the ultimate idiot for trying to Tombstone the Deadman. Taker is now 13-0 at Wrestlemainia.

Big Show vs Akibono 0/10 It was just a waste of about 3 minutes. Most of which they spent staring each other.

Trish Stratus vs Christy 5/10 Short match. Christy can't really wrestle just yet.

John Cena vs JBL 5/10 A bit of a dissappointment but if your a Cena fan like me you gotta love the fact he won the title.

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle 10/10 What we had here was an excellent technical match. It was a match that lived up to all the hype. Angle wins when HBK taps out to the Ankle Lock. I hope we see more of these two and I have reason to think we will once the draft is complete.

Triple H vs Batista 8/10 Good match. Batista becomes World Heveyweight Champion. This was the first Wrestlemainia where both the WWE and World Heveyweight titles changed hands.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

a really good opening match for the show to get people into the mood (although in truth it was only the second show of the night).  eddie's unique surfboard stretch was simply amazing, i'll have to try it out sometime.

8/10

6-man Money in the Bank Ladder Match

Wow.  Just wow.  so much stuff happens off the ladders.  a T-bone suplex by Shelton, a falling head butt (FROM THE FRIGGIN' TOP OF THE LADDER!!!!!!!!) by Beniot, a clothesline from Shelton running up another ladder, Kane jumping to the outside from the turnbuckle to take out the other men WOW!!!!  Kane tries to chokeslam Benoit from the ladder but Benoit counters into the crossface.  two thumbs up in the atmosphere for this one.

10/10

Legend vs. Legend Killer

This was much better than i expected it to be.  i'm not a fan of Orton, but Taker has been one of my favorites for a long time.  Orton really shines in this match, countering the chokeslam with the RKO, then tries to tombstone Taker, but taker reverses into a tomebstone of his own to win.

9/10

Women's Championship Match

Christy looks good, but she shouldn't wrestle.  bad match.

3/10

Shawn Micheals vs. Kurt Angle

another match that's completely wow.  by far the best match of the night.  there are no other word to describe it; you'll have to see it for yourself.  crowd chants were funny, as ""let's go angle! let's go michaels!  let's go angle! let's go michaels!"" started several times.

10/10

Big Show vs. Akebono

a lot of people were ripping this match because Show lost.  i might be too if i hadn't taken japanese for three years in high school.  big show probably is a lot stronger than Akebono (he friggin' picked him up off his feet), but Akebono (aka Chad; he's from Hawaii) wrestles sumo for his living.  he is a grand champion, for crying out loud, in a society that generally has a glass ceiling for those that are not native-born.  watching him flip big show over will just blow your mind.  very good match, in my opinion.

8/10

JBL vs. John Cena

if you weren't aware of it, cena's time is now!  buy his album!  this match, however, could have been better.  the problem was they were told to cut it short because they were going over their time limit, and the match suffered because of it.

7/10 (generously)

Triple H vs. Batista

man you have to love Batista!  real powerhouse match here with some great stuff happening.  You have to see this match.  not the best match of the night, but certainly very very good.

9/10

this dvd is definitely worth the buy.

special features:

the previews are all really good.

the hall of fame ceremony is funny at times, touching at others, and enjoyable no matter whether or not you know who the guys are (myself included).

the battle royal is great, with some good brand loyalty shining through, plus your last chance to see Rhyno in a WWE match.  (possibly Snitsky as well, since you we haven't seen him again.

This year congrats WWE, mainly congrats to Kurt and Shawn who absolutely stole the show and that match should have been the main event without a doubt, next best would have to be the Money in the Bank where Shelton Benjamin stole that match and I don't know why Kane was thrown into it*In my opinion it was the perfect time to debut Frankie Kazarian but hey who am I to say what i wanna see* but still great show from Benjamin and everyone else in that match. Eddie and Rey was pretty good but Rey worried about his mask too much(come on Rey just let it fall off we saw your face in WCW) Trish vs. Christy...no comment, HHH vs. Batista was your typical powerhouse match, JBL vs. Cena was cut short due to the show running over which really was a slap in the face to these guys who couldve put on a good match(hopefully at Judgement Day they can prove that) Austin coming back along with Pipers Pit was good and Hogan and Hassan confrontation with a Eugene cameo was good as well and Austin stunning Piper and Carlito was a great moment and seeing Hogan do his immortal poses one last time was a spot to remember. Taker vs. Orton was alot better than I thought it would be Taker was alot better than he was last year against Kane and Orton countering the chokeslam into the RKO was awesome, I really thought Taker shouldve dropped that one to Orton to cement his status as a true legend killer but he had to use his political power to keep his WM streak going but still a great match. Overall a great show the only problems were matches being cut short due to time but this is definitely alot better than last year and if you didn't see it on PPV you missed a great one and should definitely get it on DVD, its worth the money.",1116115200,,1948,4.197333333333333

Eddie Gurerro vs. Rey Mysterio was a great way to kick things off. The ladder match was a blast to watch. Orton vs. 'Taker wasn't a classic, but it was still very good. The match between Kurt Angle & Shawn Micheals was easily the best match of the night and quite possibly the best match of the year so far. The main reason why I gave this PPV 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the rather disappointing main event matches. HHH defended the World Heavyweight belt against Batista, in what turned out to be a good (but not great) match up. JBL vs. John Cena was probably the most disappointing championship main event on the show; it was boring and way too short. I really enjoyed the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony on disc 3. It was very touching to see some of our most loved and hated WWE superstars from the golden years of wrestling being awarded at the ceremony. Also, I really enjoyed all of the hilarious parodies of Basic Instinct, Forrest Gump, A Few Good Men, and several other popular movies.

I love the Hall of Fame ceremony, I would say I wish it was on a seperate disc like last year, but with the Legends of the 80s set coming out next month, they're all on there.  Iron Shiek's speech was classic, Jimmy Hart's was really good, and Orndorff kind of came off like a jerk.  I've never been a Hogan fan, so I won't comment on his (how most people can't see the real Hogan is beyond me).  I was expecting Piper's speech to be crazy, but he was subdued, which is shocking but not disappointing.

I wish Kurt Angle bringing out Sensationial Sherri and their singing of ""Sexy Boy"" was on there as an Easter Egg, but you can't win them all.  Hopefully, that will be on the Kurt Angle DVD that is way overdue.  They need one for Bret Hart and the Four Horsemen as well.  I don't know how to contact whoever is in charge of WWF DVDs, but those titles and putting out the old Wrestlemanias on DVDs would be great.  If they don't put out the old Wrestlemanias on DVD, they should at least do a ""Best of"" featuring:

WM 13 - Bret Hart vs Steve Austin - submission match

WM 11 - Diesel vs Shawn Michaels - WWF Title

WM 10 - Bret Hart vs Owen Hart

WM 8  - Ric Flair vs Randy Savage - WWF Title

WM 8  - Roddy Piper vs Bret Hart - Intercontinental Title

WM 11 - Owen Hart/Yokozuna vs Smoking Gunns - WWF Tag Title

WM 5  - Randy Savage vs Hulk Hogan - WWF Title

WM 7  - Ultimate Warrior vs Randy Savage - career match

WM 14 - Shawn Michaels vs Steve Austin - WWF Title

I'm sure if you put out a DVD with those and other matches on it (none of which are on DVD uncut), it would be a big seller.  Come on WWF, what do you have to lose?",1115942400,,1897,4.048517520215634
2194142,5,B0006SSNXW,"I thought this wrestlemaniawas real good.

Rey vs. Eddie - A great Luchadora battle.

Trish vs Christy - Even editing couldn't save this slopfest

Taker vs. Orton - Great fight, first time in the last few years Taker got a good wrestlemania match(Since Flair at X8)This fight could have used some blood, but it was still awesome

Money in the Bank - This was good, not great. Shelton had some awesome moves in it though. I was pissed Edge won...Edge cant cut promos, his moves are common and boring, and hes real ugly, I don't Undertsand why anyone would like. Edge is also undefeated at Wrestlemania, thats an insult to the Undertaker.

Angle vs. HBK - Best match of the night. Olympic Slam against the post....need I say more. HBK didn't bleed I WAS SHOCKED.

Big Show vs. Akeybono - YAwn

Cena vs JBL - Theres styles don't clash. Short and boring. I personnaly thought JBL carried Cena. Even though JBL hasn't been in the main event very long, hes been wrestling alot longer than Cena.

HHH vs. Batista - I liked it. HHH bled ....of course. Hes been cut open so many times, between that and the tanning he does. The skin on his forehead is like dried leaves, it breaks apart very easily.

The extras were very good. The battle royal was a place for all there B List talent. Booker deserves better than that",1115942400,,1309,4.489451476793249
2194143,3,B0006SSNXW,"The world title matches are duds, and only three matches are worth the price of admission. The Money in the bank was the awe inspiring WrestleMaina ladder match that happens once a year now, Angle vs Michaels was amazing, Undertaker and Orton seemed to be a good match. The dvd boggled my mind because it featured the complete Hall of Fame ceremony. It was featured as a solo dvd last year, with bonus matches. I think they should have done that instead of putting it on disc 3. WrestleMaina XXI was rushed, and the matches were not thought out. I hope next year, the WrestleMaina will be better then this and more thought through. RVD FOR WORLD CHAMPION!",1115942400,,655,4.559322033898305
2194144,4,B0006SSNXW,"I was very surpised with how good this years wrestlemania was. I wasen't expecting much but there ended up being alot of great matches...and also some bad ones.

Eddie Gurrero vs. Rey Mysterio-3/5

Now I my self am not a fan of the curizer weight division but I must say for what it was it was really good. ONE thing that did annoy me during the match was that Mysterios mask kept coming undone so he would have to stop and keep on putting it back on right.

Money in the bank ladder match-4/5

This match was amazing. Bodies were flying every where. This wasen't even a wrestling match. It was more like an all out brawl!! Every superstar put on a great preformance except for Edge. Edge seems to just stay out of the whole thing intill he had his shot at the case. And BTW Mattitude4life!!

UnderTaker vs. Orton-4/5

This match determined weather or not I would stay with the WWE. I hate Orton. Not only does he have little wrestling skills(took him five years to take a bump!!) but he's been getting pushes from the WWE that he doesn't deserve thanks to his dad. If they had Orton end Taker's reign...I was done. God forbid if it where to end but to someone like Orton just made me even angrier. Anyways the match its self was very good. No matter what Orton did Taker kicked out. Just seeing Taker Tombstone Orton put a smile on my face. Thanks to this match I stayed with the WWE and it help shut alot of people up. Just remember Orton fanboys....13-0.

Trish vs. Christi-2/5

I pro woman wrestler going up against the newbie. Horrible match. I can't believe that would use this match instead of a diffrent kind of match say Tag team.

HBK vs. Angle-5/5

This had to be the be the best match of the night. Two great preformers going at it with each other on the biggest stage of all. Both showed alot of athletic ability but in the end Angle came out on top. Kudos to both of them for putting on a amazing show.

Big Show vs. Abkeybono-2/5

This was just a sumo match. Very boring an stupid. Should have replaced it with a diffrent match.

John Cena vs. JBL-2/5

This was a horrible match. Just like Orton I think Cena has very little wrestling abilty. JBL held the title for nine months...so as werid as it might sound I wanted Cena to win. BUT I did not want them to put on a horrible match. JBL had to carry him through the whole match and that's really what killed it.

HHH vs. Batista-3/5

This was a decent main event match. HHH had to carry Batista through most of it but overall they both did a great job of putting on a show.",1115942400,,2539,4.2803347280334725
2194145,5,B0006SSNXW,"Wrestlemania is FINALLY starting to become the great event it deserves to be (Thank you Vince!) Since X-7, with the possible exception of X-8, the Mania cards have been the greatest EVER, from top to bottom (not just filling before the main event.) 17, 19, 20, and 21 have each including at least 3 CLASSIC matches! This event gets an A+ for great wrestling and non-stop entertainment. Here are the matches:

Match #1: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

GREAT, fast-paced, back and forth wrestling by two guys who rarely disappoint! Many near falls and excellent technical match. The fans were SO into this match which elevated it that much more.

Rating: 8/10

Match #2: ""Money in the Bank"" Ladder Match -

Edge vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane

WOW! We all know by now that E&C are the masters of this match, but EVERYONE here makes this thing work. Shelton is gonna be one of the greats some day, and maybe we'll look back at this match as one of his first classics. Amazingly unique offense at times (particuarly in the beginning), and NON-STOP action going on between any two guys at one time.

RATING: 9/10

Match #3: Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

A pleasant surprise! With Orton on the verge of shoulder surgery and Taker not what he used to be, I was expecting a good-but-not-great match. This was outstanding! Maybe it was the build-up, also great pacing and match length, with several times when you think it's over..but it isn't! THREE EXCELLENT MATCHES IN A ROW! Keep it up!

Rating: 7.5/10

Match #4: Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

Well, about what one would expect, though Hemme was slightly better than advertised. This is your average 5-10 min. PPV women's title match. Not bad though. (Is Christy the hottest chick ever or is it just me!?)

Rating: 4.5/10

Match #5: Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC! One of the top 4 or 5 WM matches of all-time! First 5-8 min. are pure mat wrestling with HBK actually outwrestling Angle! After that, they really let it fly and give it every once of energy they have (You can tell, they are literally crawling around the ring at times towards the end.) At about 28 min., this is the longest and by far best match of the night and of the YEAR so far. Exhausting and an absolute pleasure to watch!

Rating: 10/10!!

Match #6: Sumo Match - Big Show vs. Akebono (??)

Don't quite know what to say about this one. A waste of time for any PPV event, let alone one of the biggest ever! Please, put Big Show in a decent match against ANYONE but a sumo wrestler. And for godsake, cover the man up. No one wants to see that!

RATING: 1/10

Match #7: JBL vs. John Cena

This is certainly not worthy of a PPV title match, and neither of these guys are worthy of this kind of stage. The crowd was dull, the match was dull, and whoever had the brilliant idea of pushing Bradshaw to the title should be fired on the spot! This guys has zero charisma and zero performing skill. Disappointing to say the least.

Rating: 4.5/10

Match #8: Triple H vs. Batista

This was an excellent 'heavyweight' match (i.e. a knockdown dragout) between two guys who know how to put on a show! Excellent anticipation and build-up, classic stare-down, and good pacing throughout. I believe Triple H has better matches with more of the high-flyer/technical type (HBK, Benoit, Angle, etc.) however this was certainly main event quality. Much better than the re-match at Backlash, and electric crowd atmosphere.

Rating: 8/10

Overall, my advice is BUY THIS NOW! If your any kind of fan of the sport, this is an absolute emotional roller-coaster from the word go. I didn't even mention the return of HOGAN, Austin, Roddy Piper (getting stunned), Hall of fame 2005 class, Mean Gene, and on and on. This one will be remembered for awhile to come!

2194146,5,B0006SSNXW,"This was one of the best shows WWE has put on in a long time, every year Wrestlemania sells out based on being Wrestlemania within minutes.  This year did not disapoint.

Eddie Vs Rey-3/5

This match was good, both these guys are sound technical wrestlers and they opened the match good, would have been a great smackdown match, and was a good Wrestlemania match.

Money in the bank Ladder Match-5/5

This match was awsome, this kind of stuff is what wrestlemania is all about!  Shelton Benjermin really earns his stripes in this match, and Benoit and Jericho show why they are considered two fo the best in the business.  Classic Wrestlemania stuff.

Hogan apperence-3/5

Normally stuff like this at 'mania really annoys me, I.E the Miller Cat Fight girls pillow fight(?) But it was cool to see Hogan do his thing, granted the crowd sucked, but Hogan still got a huge pop for what it was, Hogan is a huge part of the Wrestlemania legacy and it was great to see him be a part it.

Undertaker Vs Randy Orton-5/5

This was a great match, for what it was, it didn't compare to the angle/micheals match, but for the elements that takers streak was on the line, and bringing back Ortons dad with the cast in the mix, it gets a solid 5 out of 5

Trish Vs Christy-2/5

This was a pretty bad match, only because Hemme isn't a wrester, she learned fairly quick for the time she had, and Trish did an excellent job of carrying her.  I understand Christy is a hot thing right now because she was in playboy, but they shouldn't be experimenting at Wrestlemania.  P.S Trish looked extremely hot in this match

HBK Vs Angle-5/5

This was a great match, I liked other matches from both of these guys better, but as far as a match telling a great story, this is the best story telling match of all time.  These guys are great.

Pipers Pit w/stone cold-5/5

This was awsome, predictable yes, but Piper and Austin are the two best off the cuff entertainers in the history of the WWe, Piper's responses to the Crowds ""what?"" chances were classic, Austin was hillarious too, this is what Wrestlemania is all about as far as entertainment goes.

Sumo Match-3/5

This match got a 3 out of 5 because it actually was a good sumo match, but why was this on the wrestlemania card?  Wasn't as bad as the brawl for all at wrestlemania 15.

JBL VS John Cena-2/5

This was a horrible match, real slow, short and boring.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because Cena won the title, i'm glad WWE is pushing the younger guys on both shows.

Batista VS HHH-4/5

This match started out really crappy, both the championship matches had it rough because they came after the HBK/Angle Match, kind of like HHH/Jericho at Wrestlemania 18 going on after Hogan/Rock, but it looked like it was going to be another JBL/Cena match for the first 8 minutes or so, but once Triple H did that sick ass blade job batisita really started pushing it, it became a good mania quality match, and a new champion to boot.

Over all,great show, even the stuff that wasn't up to par, was at least watchable and memorable. Awesome wrestlemania, should go down in the books as one of the best ever.",1115856000,2,3144,4.466666666666667
2194147,5,B0006SSNXW,"This DVD package just makes WrestleMania feel special. Presentation is everything, and the fold out case with color photos and a booklet just look great.

The entire Hall of Fame ceremony is here, complete with Hulk Hogan's full, unedited speech where he thanks his wife, his kids, and Vince McMahon - something we didn't see on TV. It's a fantastic speech. Not quite as good as Jimmy Hart's - man, he made me proud to be a wrestling fan.

Unlike the dumb fans who write WWE reviews here, I'm not going to list off the matches - you probably know them already and can find info on them elsewhere. We're here to review the disc.

Packed full of extras - from superstar appearances, the weeks festivities, the movie parodies and a hilarious set of bloopers and outtakes from the filming. HHH fluffing his lines, Flair falling off his donkey and Edge's contribution to Taxi Driver are all here to see and enjoy.

Some great promo and history packages, together with buildups, reviews and a music video.

This year's Wrestlemania (thank God) did not suffer from fillers and poor storylines. Only the most well-developed WWE characters were used this year, which made this pay-per-view the best I've seen in YEARS! (All the mid-carders got stuck on Disc 2 in a crappy battle royale!)

Eddie Guererro vs. <a href=""rey%20mysterio"" onmouseover=""window.status='Rey Mysterio'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">Rey Mysterio</a>

Was it good? Yeah. Did the match offer something we've never seen before? NOPE. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Fast-paced opener with plenty of reversals to satisfy the ""technical-wrestling"" fans.

LOVED BY: Lucha fans everywhere.

HATED BY: People who think their current storyline is GAY.

GRADE: B

*BACKSTAGE VIGNETTE*

JBL w/Cabinet meet HHH w/Ric Flair

A lot of foreshadowing takes place as their egos clash.

*MONEY IN THE BANK LADDER MATCH*

Jericho vs. Christian vs. Benoit

vs. Kane vs. Edge vs. Benjamin

NOTHING in this match  was EVER boring. A lot of great spots and hardcore action. Shelton Benjamin impressed me quite a bit, while Benoit (for the millionth time) earned my respect (Benoit fakes an arm injury that looks SO real that people in the backstage actually began to worry about him)!

LOVED BY: People who miss them good ol' TLC matches!

HATED BY: Matt Hardy fans (Edge wins this one).

GRADE: A

*REAL AMERICAN SEGMENT*

Eugene talks about how he's retarded and gets attacked by Hassan and Daivari. After the camel clutch is applied, the crowd explodes as HOGAN makes the save. Afterward, Hogan poses for 44 hours and 28 minutes.

LOVED BY: Anyone who says their prayers and takes their vitamins.

HATED BY: Everyone who expected the LEG DROP, but never saw it.

GRADE: A-

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

What made this match incredible was the HYPE surrounding it! These two mess up three times in the match (goofy clothesline, failed Last Ride, and sloppy RKO), but overall, lived up to my expectations.

LOVED BY: Old people who remember ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton and his ""cast.""

HATED BY: People who hate Undertaker's win streak.

GRADE: B+

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

They need to make Victoria INSANE again. She's much more of a pay-per-view performer.

LOVED BY: Horny guys.

HATED BY: Matt Hardy fans (They just hate seeing Lita smile after what she did).

GRADE: D

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

CLASSIC. I've always loved these two (no matter who they face, they ALWAYS steal the show). This was honestly the BEST match I've ever seen. The finish of the match got the WHOLE crowd going nuts. They deserved their standing ovation!

LOVED BY: True wrestling fans.

HATED BY: People who suck.

GRADE: A+

*PIPER'S PIT*

Austin and Piper trading insults was pretty entertaining. What made this segment PRICELESS was the addition of Carlito Caribbean Cool. His lines were hilarious. ALSO, pay attention to Piper's impromptu reaction to the crowd saying ""WHAT?"" Great stuff!

LOVED BY: Everyone who loves the ""ENTERTAINMENT"" in Sports Entertainment.

HATED BY: Virgins and nerds who only wanted to see ""wrestling.""

GRADE: A-

Big Show vs. Akebono (Sumo Match)

Well... this crap was at least tolerable. And seeing Big Show's butt cheeks was indeed a sight to behold!

LOVED BY: Immature kids who couldn't stop laughing at the sight of ""butt cheeks.""

HATED BY: People who never want to see Big Show's cheeks. EVER.

GRADE: D+

JBL vs. John Cena

Here's some information for everyone who thought this match SUCKED: It turns out that Cena and JBL were told last second to shorten their match because Wrestlemania was running a bit long. Hopefully their ""I QUIT"" Match on Judgment Day redeems the two.

LOVED BY: Everyone who thought JBL never deserved the title.

HATED BY: Everyone who misses Cena's freestyles and cocky attitude.

GRADE: C-

*WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2005*

Interesting to see these veterans being escorted by lovely women.

Batista vs. Triple H

Not spectacular, but pretty damn good. Very fun to watch and a great way to end Wrestlmenia. Batista and his ""THUMBS DOWN"" was definitely a cinematic way to end Triple H's title reign.

LOVED BY: Hunter Hearst Haters.

HATED BY: People who don't believe Batista has enough charisma.

GRADE: B-

Disc 2: The best part of this second disc is the Wrestlemania XXI trailers! The bloopers were decent, and the 30 man battle royale is a great way to kill some time.

Disc 3: HALL OF FAME CEREMONY

*WARNING* This disc is ONLY for TRUE wrestling fans. This is a very emotional package with a lot of nostalgia sealed in its contents. All the speeches are very touching, with one exception: The Iron Sheik.

He talks for over 10 minutes and you have no idea what the hell he's talking about. He also ends his speech about 4 times and keeps going afterward. Hilarious stuff.

DISC ONE:

- Lilian Garcia sings ""America the Beautiful""

She sings with a great voice and there's a great video package of the WWE superstars visiting our troops in Iraq.

- Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero

This was a very good match between two guys who know how to put on a great one. It was hindered a bit by Rey fiddling with his mask, but a very good Lucha match. ***1/2

- JBL, Basham Brothers, Orlando Backstage

A good vignette to have JBL/Orlando meet HHH/Flair.

- Money In the Bank Ladder Match

Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Christian, Edge, Kane, & Shelton Benjamin made yet another classic Wrestlemania ladder match. More than just a spot show, this told a great story, and established Shelton Benjamin as a superstar ****1/2

- Eugene attacked by Hassan and Davari

...and saved by Hulk Hogan! An unforgettable segment.

- Undertaker vs Randy Orton

Wow! This was the sleeper match of the show. Even Orton's father Bob came out with the running gag of the fractured arm. A really creative finish, too. ***1/2

- Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemme

Security took away any Edge-Lita signs, and this brief match was a good chance for us to go get more beer.

- Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle

I've been to a dozen shows, including six PPVs, and I have to honestly say this is the best match I have personally seen live. And that includes Bret Hart vs Chris Benoit in the ""Owen"" match in Kansas City. The last minute is absolutely perfect. You need to watch this match over and over. And over *****

- Basic Instinct / Taxi Driver Parodies

See disc 2 for my comments here.

- Piper's Pit with Steve Austin

This segment was dynamite. These guys were perfect with mics and Carlito Cool, who interfered here is on his way to being golden on the microphone.

- Sumo Match, Big Show vs Akebono

Slightly novel and interesting, but thankfully brief

DISC TWO:

-WWE Championship Match : JBL vs John Cena

Was this a good match? No. Did it switch the title over after a long heel run by JBL? Yes. Enough said. *1/2

- WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2005

Everyone in this class was in Wrestlemania in 1985. I'll cover this in detail in Disc 3, but this was a very nice and appropriate segment.

- World Heavyweight Championship: HHH vs Batista

A very good match that people had waited a long time for. These guys told a good main event story with a great ending. ***

- Main Event Promotional Spots

Movie Parodies

-Forrest Gump, Braveheart, A Few Good Men, Taxi Driver, Gladiator, Basic Instinct, Pulp Fiction, Dirty Harry, When Harry Met Sally

While WM usually lands in a random city without any theme tie-in, this year WWE took advantage of being in LA and used a thorough Hollywood theme. Hence these brilliant movie parodies. The two best ones hands down are Basic Instinct and Taxi Driver.

- Outtakers & Bloopers

Career Highlight Packages

- Shawn Michaels, Kurt Angle, Undertaker

- Hollywood Boulevard Event

- Superstar Appearances

- Battle Royal

Booker T won this 30 man Smackdown vs Raw match.

- Motorhead Unplugged w/ HHH

HHH rehearses his entrance backstage with Motorhead jamming unplugged.

DISC THREE:

2005 Induction Ceremony

- Previous Inductees

- Nikolai Volkoff

- ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton

- The Iron Sheik

Okay, I haven't laughed as hard as I did during this seven, or eight, or twelve minute speech in I don't know how long.

- Paul Orndorff

- Jimmy Hart

Man, this was a good speech. Jimmy Hart reminds you why you are a wrestling fan. This speech was awesome.

- Roddy Piper

Great speech, great introduction by Ric Flair.

- Hulk Hogan

These last two were the highlights of this disc, and this was a very welcome addition.

2194151,5,B0006SSNXW,"This was a good DVD, but it needs an Easter Egg of the segment on Smackdown where Kurt Angle comes out with Sensational Sherri and does a great Shawn Michaels imitation.

I agree with earlier reviewers, there has to be a Kurt Angle DVD.  They already have one for Brock Lesnar and John Cena, so why not the most celebrated real athlete in WWF history?  The DVD should cover the ""with hair"" era and the ""bald"" era.  All the great Angle matches that could be on there, such as his battles with the Rock, Chris Jericho, Brock Lesnar, Chris Benoit, Steve Austin, Eddie Guerrero and his hilarious antics with Edge and Christian, Team Angle and the summer of 2001 when he teamed up with Austin (Hero! Jackass! Hero! Jackass!).  Matches such as the Hell in the Cell from Armageddon 2000 when he beat 5 men, to his first title win over the Rock and first Intercontinental title win over Chris Jericho, these matches are not available on DVD.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit vs Christian (w/Tyson Tomko) vs Shelton Benjamin vs Edge vs Kane: Not what i was expecting, i expected more, but this was still a great match, it had great spots like Benjamin T-Bone suplexing Edge off the top of the ladder also Benjamin running up a ladder that is attached to another and clotheslining Jericho off, the other guys did good but Benjamin shined all over this match. 5/5

Eugene comes out and thinks this is awesome until Davari and Hassan come out and attack him then Hulk Hogan comes out and cleans house then poses for 5 hours then finally leaves. I can have a little Hogan time but not to much of him.

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton: This match is Takers 2nd best ever match at Mania because Taker/HHH is still number 1, Orton even tho he has an injured shoulder he carries Taker to a good performance that has good back and forth action. 4/5

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme (w/Lita): Trish tried but still a crap match. 1/5

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle: Here we go, a classic match right here, this match will just draw you in till it ends, great wrestling and spots, its awesome, the main reason to get this event. 5/5

Piper's Pit: Roddy Piper and Stone Cold trade insults and were just getting started when Triple C came out and badmouthed both, Roddy spits apple on Carlito so he batters Piper until Austin beats up both and drinks. 2/5 for the whole thing.

Sumo Match: Akebono vs Big Show: Crap. 1/5

WWE Heavyweight Title: John Bradshaw Layfield vs John Cena: They build JBL up for close to a year then have him lose it to a crappy move like the F U , JBL does all the wrestling and Cena is rubbish in the ring as usual. 1/5

They bring the Hall of Famers out for celebration

World Heavyweight Title: Triple H (w/Ric Flair) vs Batista: The better of the two world title matches but is still not that great, average main event. 2/5

REY MYSTERIO defeated EDDIE GUERRERO: Entertaining opener which definitely could have been better, but was still very solid. Needed at least another few minutes, as these two deserve more than a 13 minute duration. Not as crisp as I was expecting (with the one seriously botched move), but that was offset by some moments of sensational impact (which reminded me of the classic Malenko vs Mysterio bouts of '96). There was pretty much a good mix of everything involved, although a few more minutes would have allowed them to really step it up towards the end. The same can be said for the anti-climactic ending. And whoever was the person behind Rey wearing a new mask made a serious mistake, as his adjusting of it every 30 seconds did get more than a touch annoying. But please don't get me wrong, this was still very good & a tremendously solid opener. Hard to rate, as it had it's ups & downs. This match does make history though, as I have finally sold out to the .5 rating system (don't worry, I won't overuse it). Match Rating...7.5

EDGE defeated CHRIS BENOIT, KANE, CHRISTIAN, CHRIS JERICHO & SHELTON BENJAMIN in a 6 Man 'Money In The Bank' Ladder Match: Spectacular ladder match which hardly let up on the action. All men contributed in some way & not too much more could have been asked from them. For a 6 man match, I did not think it was overbooked & was as natural as practically possible. The only probable exception was the 3 ladder spot early on, which didn't really have a good enough payoff for something so rehearsed. Not quite worth a 10 rating, but not far from it. 16 minutes wasn't quite enough & the ending also probably deserved something a little more special. But I'm nitpicking a little. Entertaining & sufficiently spectacular. Kudos to everyone involved, especially Benjamin (who took another step to super-stardom) & Benoit (who made me barrack for him when previously I didn't really care if he won or not). Close to being the match of the night. Match Rating...9

EUGENE / MUHAMMAD HASSAN / HULK HOGAN SEGMENT: This used up 11 minutes, so it most definitely should be part of the overall PPV rating. Nice booking to include Eugene & then Hassan. The moment fit in very well in the grand scheme of things. Probably not quite as funny as it should have been, but humorous enough. And I personally would have liked Hogan to acknowledge Eugene as he was heading to the back. Plus, where was the legdrop of doom? I know he's injured, but still! Overall, a nice touch. Segment Rating...7

THE UNDERTAKER defeated RANDY ORTON: Probably the match which will get the most mixed reviews (although Orton-haters will never see anything good that he does). Personally, I thought this was absolutely sensational. Like the majority of Orton's matches, the bout started tremendously. I was waiting for the monotony to eventually settle in, but it just never came. Any restholds or submission holds were done for a purpose & were kept short (go back & view the match again if you think this was full of restholds). While not everything was perfectly crisp & a few of the simplest moves didn't go 100% right, what I liked a lot about this match was the impact of almost every move. On top of all this, the story was told perfectly by by both men. Proof of this was the great reaction the match got from the crowd. Add a well-placed 'Cowboy' Bob Orton run-in & a sensationally booked final few minutes & this was simply tremendous stuff. Fourteen minutes was the perfect duration for these 2. Match Rating...8.5

TRISH STRATUS defeated CHRISTY HEMME to Retain the Women's title: Nowhere near as bad as it could have been. Trish played her character perfectly (when doesn't she?) & Christy's offensive spots were well-booked & sufficiently performed. While there was the predictable awkward moments that one would expect from a bout involving a debutant, it truthfully wasn't too much more than the usual women's match anyway (sorry, but it's true). I would have preferred a better finish, but seeing as though I'm in a good mood, the correct woman won & it only lasted 5 minutes, I'll just pass this. Match Rating...5

KURT ANGLE defeated SHAWN MICHAELS: I kept trying to lower my expectations before this match, but as soon as the pre-match promo & staredown filled my screen, I was just helpless in getting caught up in the action. Was I disappointed following that? A little. But when your expectations were as high as mine, it was always a possibility. Correctly given 28 minutes, but it actually felt that long, if not longer (which isn't always a good sign). Basically, it was split up into 3 lots of 9 minutes. I really liked what the 2 attempted during the first third of the bout. It was a nice combination of something that was predictable, but different. Plus, it set up the rest of the bout well. But it went on a little too long & was a bit too repetitive for my liking. The action kicked up a gear (predominantly) on the outside of the ring in the middle portion of the bout. Some great psychology was evident here & you could tell that both men were trying to do something spectacular to finish the match off. Whether something spectacular was eventually needed, I'll leave up for debate, as I am still unsure myself. The final 3rd was predictably excellent. While it may have stretched out a little too long & had some downtime, it was all part of the big picture & worked a treat in getting the crowd involved, while keeping us all guessing as to the final result. Actually, a little hard to rate, it will be interesting to see how this match ages, but my guess is it will be favorably. I'm going to say this tied the ladder match for 'match of the night'. Match Rating...9

PIPER'S PIT SEGMENT with 'STONE COLD' STEVE AUSTIN & CARLITO: Thankfully, Austin & Piper worked well together here. 15 minutes in total, Piper controlled his ad-libbing very much for the good of the segment, while 'Stone Cold' did what he always does (which was just fine by the live crowd). The unpredictable addition of Carlito was actually a good idea in theory, but at the end of the day, didn't really add a great deal. But overall, this segment was a success, and like the Hogan appearance earlier, was very fitting. Segment Rating...7

AKEBONO defeated THE BIG SHOW in a Sumo Match: The Big Show came decked out in sumo gear & Akebono made him look like Chris Masters! Seriously folks, I didn't want to look too closely at the big Hawaiian. Took an eternity to begin & was pretty much a waste of time once it did. Clearly a work, I just felt no involvement whatsoever. And for some unknown reason, I thought sumo contests were best out of 3. Time waster. Match Rating...2

JOHN CENA defeated JOHN BRADSHAW LAYFIELD to Win the WWE Championship: Like a movie or a play, a wrestling match should have 3 acts; A beginning, a middle & an end. Well, this match only had 1 act, as there wasn't really a beginning & the end would have been missed if you blinked at the wrong time. Seriously disappointing, I knew we were in trouble when JBL hooked in a sleeper-hold at the 6 minute mark. In all honesty, the 2 styles simply did not mix here & both men's lack of offensive repertoire was found out. No-one was to blame more than the other, they just both struggled to pass the test. At the end of the day, the bout was saved by Cena's final flash of spark & intensity. But it meant so much less because a more than sufficient feud had cold water poured on it by the first 8-10 minutes of the match. While ending the bout at the 12 minute mark wasn't befitting a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania, it probably was wise for the quality of the bout itself. I'll speak more on the repercussions of this match later in this column. Match Rating...5

HALL OF FAME SEGMENT: 8 minutes in length, this was pretty standard fare, but very fitting. I think it's a good idea to have this be an annual staple at WrestleMania. Call me old-fashioned, but I like the nostalgia aspect of it all. It's not doing any harm whatsoever & strengthens the importance of WrestleMania. Segment Rating...6

BATISTA defeated TRIPLE H to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: Well-structured 21 minute match (especially after the JBL vs Cena disappointment) that was as good as we possibly could have asked for in the circumstances. Triple H worked the match well as the heel (which is something JBL couldn't do), although the pace wasn't exactly non-stop. I especially liked the entire final sequence, which was a pleasant surprise considering the match duration. Totally satisfactory for a WrestleMania main event, although nowhere near anything special. And finally, congratulations to both men for achieving something I thought they couldn't do sufficiently; Work a passable 20 minute match. I admit that I was wrong on that, although I still point out that the Triple H vs Randy Orton bout from the Royal Rumble was better. Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (73/110) = 66

Looking at the key, I have basically given WrestleMania 21 a 'B' grade & said that it was a 'good event that was worth the money'. I'm more than happy with that rating & comment. Like I said at the top of this column, there was enough included amongst this event to please anyone, and I think that has to be considered when judging the event as a whole. When attempting that, it becomes more difficult to please everyone & get a high rating. Having said that, a few adjustments here & there & this could have been right up there with the best ever WrestleManias. As it is though, as an early guide, I would just rate it in the top 10 of all time. Overall, this was a very solid event that was brought down by 2 time wasters & 2 title matches which were only sufficient. A final mention to the crowd (another area where the opinion of quality was split), as I felt they were always involved when they needed to be & when the match quality was high. Most definitely a recommended watch.",1114732800,8,10500,4.5779670037253855
2194155,5,B0006SSNXW,"This WrestleMania felt like WrestleMania, unlike last year. Don't get me wrong. WrestleMania 20 had its moments, but that's was what it was: moments. WrestleMania 21 could be the best overall WrestleMania since X-Seven.  I was impressed with the quality of this year's event from top to bottom.

1) Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio-5/5- The best opening match since WrestleMania X (Bret vs. Owen). There were a lot of high-risk maneuvers in this match and a shocking ending that caught this 13-yr. WWE fan off his guard.

2)Money In The Bank Ladder Match- 5/5- This was a great ladder match. When I think of ladder matches, I don't think of the TLC matches. I think of matches that actually utilize the ladders to their full potential, like this match. There were some crazy spots in this match as well as some innovative uses for the ladder.

If you want to see a classic Mania moment, watch Hogan destroy Hassan and Divari. It was great to see the Hall of Famer in the red and yellow again.

3) Orton vs. Undertaker- 5/5- Taker's best WrestleMania match since Ric Flair. Excellent match that had me on the edge of my seat.  Great RKO by Orton, interference by Bob Orton, and a great reversal by the Deadman.  Orton learned that there are just some legends that can't be killed.

4) Christy vs. Trash- 3/5- This was a filler match. No more and no less. I thought about the good old days when Gail Kim, Victoria, Jazz, Molly Holly, and Jaqueline were contenders for the title during this match. Say what you will about Lita's personal affair.  She's a darn good wrestler and I hope she returns to action sooner than later.

5) Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels- 5/5- The Best Match on this Card. This was better than the Iron Man match in my personal opinion. I want a sequel and I also want to give props to both Angle and HBK. They can both be counted on forever for great WrestleMania performances. Maybe HBK can face Dude Love next year. LOL. Just kidding.

6)The Sumo Match-2/5- It was another waste of time.  Big Show threw the match as I half expected. If the match was legit, Show could and would have taken him.

Piper's Pit- Entertaining as ever. The first 2 minutes Piper and Austin are in there are priceless. I have to say Carlito's interference was....cool, as he got a Stone Cold Stunner for his troubles.

7) John Cena vs. JBL-3/5- No offense but this match was short.  I think the entrances lasted longer than the match itself. I was happy to see Cena get the title. But I have to give props to JBL. He had a good reign as champ. If you would have told me a year ago he'd have the title for 10 months or at all, I'd call you an idiot. As Bob Dylan wrote, the times they are a changin'.

8)HHH vs. Batista 5/5- Great main event.  I think Trips needs to stop having Motorhead playing him to the ring at Mania. It's just bad luck, no offense to Motorhead. Batista held his own in this match, and as a result, the match was strong.  The best part was the attempted pedigree by HHH. HHH sold that moment very well. At the beginning of this year, I guaranteed my friends Batista would be champ by its end. And now, the beast is truly unleashed!

This is an excellent Mania, and with a bonus match and the Hall of Fame ceremony, it will be an excellent DVD.",1114300800,11,3262,4.397670549084858
2194156,5,B0006SSNXW,"The Kurt Angle DVD set should be three disks:

2194159,4,B0006SSNXW,"On one DVD (although almost all never appeared together) you get Hogan, Flair, Taker, Michaels, Triple H, Benoit and Kurt Angle. Hogan is already in the Hall Of Fame, but one day the rest of these guys will join him in it. Hogan beating up Hassan and Divari was great, Triple H's intro ruled. Angle vs. Michaels stole the entire show. Cena vs JBL was a waste of time. Cena is probably one of the worst wrestlers ever and the whole rap thing sucks. He's a thug plain and simple and has no business in a wrestling ring. Batista vs HHH was good but not great. All the rest of the matches were on or below average. As for the ladder match, one of the worst of all time. But still, buy this DVD because in the end it was a good PPV and after all, every wrestling fan should own all Wrestlemania DVD's.

2194160,4,B0006SSNXW,"Rey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerrero:

Guerrero was always going to be the person to watch in this match, as he was the one carrying Mysterio back in WCW, but this is a completly different Guerrero here,from WWE Champion to a curtain jerker with only thirteen minutes to produce a good match. Mysterio seemed more concerned with keeping his mask on as it slipped during the match than having a generally great wrestling match with a clearly unmotivated Guerrero, highlights included a flying corkscrew from Mysterio, and a few good near-falls before Mysterio roleld Guerrero up for the pin ***1/2

Hulk Hogan made an apperance as expected, to attack Hassan, to the ovation of the night, it's going to be hard topping this guy. EVER.

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton:

Say what you want about Orton, but for a guy with a shoulder injury, he carried Undertaker to his greatest match in a long time, everything was handled well here, 'Taker gave Orton a good deal of offense, sold the R.K.O, and pulled an impressive tombstone reversal to defeat Orton, Bob Orton's apperance attacking The Undertaker with the cast made the match. ***

WWE Women's Championship: Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemmi, short and painlessly sweet, good job the WWE relaised this was going to suck and booked it as a toilet break, Christy looked better than a lot of crap, but she still sucks, Trish wins with a kick to keep the belt *

Kurt Angle vs Shawn Micheals: One of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time, if not one of the greatest matches ever, Angle and Micheals engaged in a feverish exchange of counter-holds, near falls, moonsaults, and knew when to make the match better after a few minutes, Angle locking Micheals in an ankle lock fails him the first time, sweet chin music fails Micheals even after he connects with it, and Angle is able to use another ankle lock to make Shawn tap out cleanly after nearly two minutes of Micheals refusing to give in, nice to see Micheals get booed a great deal from some people in the crowd loyal to Bret, this feud never booked Micheals to look more credible, or entertaining, than Angle, and Angle gained more credibility from it. *****

Sumo Match: Big Show vs Akebono: Short and painful, who really wants to see Big Show wearing a sumo's traditional garb? Barly anything...

WWE Championship: John Cena vs J.B.L: What the hell was that? Seven short minutes of J.B.L carrying the match on his back, Cena gaining little offense, and then suddenly uses an F-U, ONE F-U, to win the championship out of nowhere? Whilst the match was solid for what it was, it made J.B.L's reign look like a fluke, and made Guerrero and Booker T, challengers for that belt, look like losers for not being able to get it off him in twenty minute matches. *

World Heavyweight Championship: Batista vs Triple H: Good bloody lord, Batista wrestled a twenty minute match as I suspected, and it completly exposed him, still, he did slightly better than Goldberg ever did in that environment, and knew when to use his bigger moves, plus Hunter's entrance was spectacular ***

Overall, a spectacular Wrestlemania, Piper's Pit segment did more to make Piper look better than Austin, who really looked bored and wanted a pay-cheque, Carlito's apperance for comedy releif was welcome, and gave him more exposure, Hogan's apperance, as well as Bob Ortons', gave the fans more entertainment, Angle and Micheals had a classic, and the right people went over in the main events. Far superior to the four-match Twenty (and really, only the main event of that was *****)",1113955200,3,3555,4.765853658536585

Ladder Match: Kane, Edge, Christian, Jericho, Benoit, Shelton. Started great, some unique moves never seen in a ladder match, but ending slowed all momentum. ***

Christy Hemme vs. Trish, for the Womens title. Quick match, go to the frigde and grab a snack, then the match will be over. *

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton, this was a great match, could have been a bit longer, but it was worth watching. Orton has a great counter move, when he turns a Taker chokeslam into a RKO. ****

Big Show vs. Akebono, in a Sumo match. It was billed as the ""biggest match in Wrestlemainia history"", due to the size of the two wrestlers. It should be renamed the biggest waste of time. However, Big Show did look very goofy with that Sumo attire. At least you can laugh at him. *

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels, best match by far. This was a wrestling classic from two of the greatest. Great moves, close calls, high risk, this match had everything. *****

John Cena vs. JBL, for the WWE Champoionship. Should have been much better, for a Champioship match. Nothing really interseting about this match, Cena seemed to hyped to make me believe he was really after JBL. It was also far shorter, but I could not see these to wrestlers doing anything worth waiting longer for. **

Batista vs. Triple H, for TRIPLE H's World Heavyweight Title. I really had high hopes for this one, but was not impressed. There were hardly any moves, besides a few from Triple H. It was more of a match that was just waiting for the ending. I did not like the flow of the match. I like Batista, but did no see anything great from him, and as strong as he is, he should have more power moves. The only move in the whole match I liked was Batista's unique counter out of the Pedigree to somekind of neckdrop slam. Other then that it was a lousy main event. I should give it only two stars, but Triple H did agree to part with his title belt for a while, so I will throw in a third star. ***

Hulk Hogan appearing to throw Hassan and Davari out of the ring.

Austin and pipper's pit ! for the second time of the night the staples was creating an earthquake on Down town boulevard! cool to see Austin back for one night at least

JBL (sucks) vs Cena : the smackdown brand isn't the best but Cena made it higher that night ,Bradshaw delivered a very poor match as he used too ,he guaranted...let me laugh,poor perf but great finish to put an end to this mascarade of the wrestling god...

Batista vs HHH : Better than expected ,but no surprise HHH lost his title after a bloody thing on the ring post,cool response from the audience to Batista ,who i think ,is a little short tecnhicly even compared to Orton ,he only gave punches 90% of the time and delivered his finishing move ,HHH did it all ,he wore the match on his shoulders , one of the best HHH match this year i think even if he lost his title

2194169,2,B0006SSNXW,"WrestleMania 21 was a very exciting event in some cases. I'm an old school wrestling fan and this was the first PPV I've seen live in two years but it wasn't that good. My brother and I loved it when ""The Real American"" Hulk Hogan came to the rescue of Eugene from the Hussan and Davari but, Trish vs. Christy is for the birds. I love beautiful women more than the next Joe (my wife being the most attractive) but WrestleMania is about the wrestling and this WrestleMania doesn't fit the bill.  There's no tag-team matches at all, no Intercontinetal title match and no desire to own this event. They drag out segments and the matches. Spare yourself the money...there is only a three matches worth watching (Money in the Bank ladder match, Orton vs. Undertaker and HBK vs. Angle) even the Title matches lack any real drama or pageantry. Maybe Triple H vs. Batista II will have some charisma atleast. This event is not worth the $50.00 I spent on it, to watch it live. Now they want me to but it again just to own the Hall of Fame ceremony DVD! What happen? Last year's Hall of Fame ceremony DVD was awesome, loaded with classic match ups. I think that's what made the DVD most appealing.  Now it's just added to this WrestleMania 21 set. Thanks alot! Next time stick with a two disc set and make the Hall of Fame ceremony its own. It's an event that stands all by itself!",1113350400,,1371,4.393700787401575
2194170,5,B0006SSNXW,"I was at this show live and it was absolutely amazing. It was my second WWE pay per view event, after WrestleMania XIX and I feel priveleged to have been a part of what I consider two of the very best (if not the best) WrestleManias ever.

Tag Champion vs. Tag Champion: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio
This was a really good opener. They start on a rather leisurely pace but quickly pick it up with some VERY high profile spots. Rey has mask trouble during this match which gets a bit distracting, but he wins with a hurricanrana roll-up and, though Eddie was a good sport, I smell a heel turn. 3 stars

Money in the Bank Ladder Match:
I probably had the most real fun during this match, as the rest of the night got so emotional. Each man stands out at different times and each plays a different and awesome role. Christian is the cowardly heel, Shelton the determined newcomer, Benoit the hardboiled veteran, Edge the desperate heel, Kane the dominant monster, and Jericho the innovator. My man Edge steals it at the end of an awesome, awesome match. 4.25 stars.

At this point Hulk comes out and kicks Muhammad Hassan's ass, and everyone almost loses their voice early in the night. A true WrestleMania moment.

Legend vs. Legend Killer: Undertaker vs. Randy Orton
I enjoyed this match a lot more than I thought I would. The nearfalls were awesome and each man played their parts to a T. This is the first great Undertaker match I remember in some time and Randy Orton is awfully close to becoming a true legend. After some interference from Cowboy Bob Orton, Undertaker manages to make it 13-0 with the tombstone. 3.5 stars

Women's Championship: Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme w/ Lita
I didn't hate this match at all. It was too short to be really ""good,"" but what were we to expect? I was pretty impressed with Christy for this being her first real match as she looked good in there and didn't blow anything major. Trish, the incumbent champion retains after doing a a good job of leading Christy by the hand to something watchable at least. 1.5 stars

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels
My God, this match was INCREDIBLE. I was a complete basket-case by the end of it, as was most of the crowd. This was a true wrestling match and is sure to go down as one of the greatest ever. Angle and Michaels are true icons and I just can't say enough good things about either them, or their show-stealing match. Kurt wins with the ankle-lock after Shawn holds on for longer than anyone I can ever remember. 5 stars, easy.

Up next was the Piper's Pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin. It felt surreal to have been there for both of Roddy Piper's triumphant WrestleMania comebacks. This was a fun segment with Piper poking fun at the ""WHAT!?"" chants and Stone Cold demonstrating his usual greatness. Carlito makes his way out, but isn't cool enough to dodge a Piper-eye-poke and Stone Cold Stunner. Piper gets pretty tipsy with Austin before receiving a stunner all his own. Fun WrestleMania moment.

Sumo Match: Big Show vs. Akebono
Well, I don't think I can rate this as it wasn't an actual wrestling match, but it was short and at least entertaining. The crowd had a higher interest level than I thought they would and it was certainly a unique WrestleMania moment. Akebono wins.

WWE Championship: John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield vs. John Cena
This wasn't a bad match, but was certainly the most disappointing of the night. It was just too short and lacked the drama essential in a WrestleMania main event, having almost no near-falls and an abrupt finish. Cena wins with the F-U. 2 stars.

Next is the Hall of Fame. Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Jimmy Hart, Paul Orndorff, Bob Orton, Iron Sheik, and Nikolai Volkoff are escorted out by some non-wrestling divas and are honored in a touching WrestleMania moment.

World Heavyweight Championship: HHH w/ Ric Flair vs. Batista
Not an awesome wrestling match, but the story was incredible and it was very well done for being mostly a power match. The crowd was very into it, the finish was sizzling hot, and it definitely sent us all home happy. Seeing Batista power out of the pedigree was OH SO satisfying. Batista wins with the powerbomb. 3.5 stars.

Overall, a completely solid show with nothing horrible at all and a number of good to great matches and unforgettable moments. WrestleMania 21 has a truly unique feeling that I will always enjoy. This show definitely has my endorsement.",1113004800,3,4418,4.635549872122762

Well for the 21st edition of Wrestlemania Los Angeles got the crown jewel which indeed was one hell of a show

Opening Match

1. Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio

This was the second best match of the night.  This match saw lots of action including many high impact dives.  Rey is able to reverse an attemted tilt a whirl and catch a hurracarana into a pin to get the 1-2-3.9/10

2. Six Way ""MONEY IN THE BANK"" Ladder Match

Edge vs Christian vs Chris Benoit vs Shelton Benjamin vs Kane vs

chris Jericho

awesome Ladder Match.  Every man took major bumps.  Edge is able to get the briefcase after nailing Benoit with a chair knocking him off of the ladder.  They should give Benoit an academy award for selling. 7.5/10

Hulk Hogan then kicks Muhammad hassans ass

3. The Undertaker vs Randy Orton

Good match with the crowd into it.  Undertaker makes it 13-0 following a tombstone. 6/10

4. Womens Championship

Trish Stratus (c) vs Christy Hemme

Hemme did a good job being this was her first singles match.  Trish wins with a Chick Kick. 3/10

5. Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels

AWESOME!  Best match of the night and quite possibly match of the year.  Angle is able to lock in the Anklelock and after almost what semmed 5 minutes Michaels taps out. 10/10

Pipers Pit with Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Very funny.

6. Sumo Match

The Big Show vs Akebono

Funny as hell.  Big Show shaves his ass.  Akebono wins

3.5/10

7. WWE Championship

Good match.  Ther is something about this rivalry that i like.  Cena wins a short match with a F-U to become WWE Champ. 6.5/10

So let me begin...

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey-Rey

Solid opener,Eddie really deserved to win this but it camed down to Rey Mysterio...good match...but i expected to see more high risk moves..well 4 stars

6 man Money in the Bank

1st off i would like to say what in the hell are you ppl thinkin' Shelton Benjamin made the match,just because he did 2 spots he is the MVP of the match...give me a break...Benoit made the match..spectacular selling from Benoit..and in the end it camed down to Edge the unfair win 5 stars(all Benoit)

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Legend vs Legend killer...awsome match...just because of the legacy angle....this was a classic,very close near falls 5 stars

Christie Hemme vs. Trish Stratus

Trish kicked Christy's ass...not WM worthy at all 2 stars..Christy sux

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

WOW....now this is WM classic...main event worthy....HBK started with some technical wrestlin'...big spots....and great ending....5/6 stars

Piper's Pit

I have 2 say this was a very good spot...but Hogan's spot stole the SCSA return...Piper was as good as he always is...Carlito will be a great wrestler some day...4 stars

Akebono vs. Big Show

Eh this was a fun match...didn't live up to the hype...but it was a new thing in WM 3 stars

JBL (c) vs. John Cena

Great build-up for the match...but this was by far the worst match on WM...just it didn't lived up to the hype..and btw JBL made Cena champ with this match,cuz Cena did nothin' 2 stars

Triple H vs. Batista

This was a good match....hell yeah..it was very better than RKO vs. HHH from Unforgiven,Batista wins...but this match was packed with a lot of emotion..it told a story and was a good match 5 stars

Overall not the best WM ,but it was the best WWE PPV since the last WM..i am giving this show 5 stars and the MVP for this show was Benoit..as well as HBK and Angle..good show",1113004800,,1971,4.707602339181286
2194173,5,B0006SSNXW,"As I mentioned about WrestleMania XX, WM's 17 and 19 were better than this one, but it was still worth the price. Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio: A great match between the 2 Tag Team title co-holders. I think that a move or 2 was botched, but a good match with Rey winning with a roll-up. 4/5 Money In the Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Kane Vs. Edge Vs. Christian: A lot of risk-taking moves in this one. What would you expect in a ladder match? Edge and Christian knock out Kane w/ a Ladder Duet (as Jerry ""The King"" Lawler called it), Benoit hits Kane w/ a headbutt off the ladder, Shelton runs up a fallen ladder and clotheslines Jericho, Shelton T-Bone suplexes Edge off a ladder, and Kane wounds Benoit's right arm by hitting it between a ladder. Benoit almost wins until Edge hits his injured arm w/ a chair, causing him to fall off, withering in pain. Edge climbs the ladder and retrieves the briefcase. 5/5 Legend Vs. Legend Killer: Randy Orton Vs. Undertaker: Undertaker's entrance was just as good as WM 20's. This time, he (almost) literally glides to the ring! I personally wanted Randy to win this. Some people in the audience even had 12-1 signs. The match highlights include Taker's usual Old School and vintage leg drop off the apron (onto his opponent's head), interference by Randy's dad, ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton, a dragon sleeper submission reversed into a DDT, and a chokeslam reversed into an RKO. In the end, Randy tries to Tombstone Taker, but it's reversed into a Tombstone by Taker. Taker's streak at WM is intact at 13-0. 4/5 WWE Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (c) Vs. Christy Hemme: Personally, I think that Christy did pretty well for her first title match. I was hoping (since Lita was training Christy) that Christy would shock us w/ a moonsault or a snap DDT, but it didn't happen. A few good roll ups here and there (and a Twist Of Fate) by Christy, but in the end, the Female Triple H retains w/ a Chick Kick. 3.5/5Kurt Angle Vs. Shawn Michaels: Possibly one of the best matches of the night. The fight went back and forth between the two. Kurt does an Angle Slam from the turnbuckle, a failed moonsault, and reverses an attempted Sweet Chin Music into an ankle lock, while Shawn attempts an elbow drop, and hits Angle w/ a springboard moonsault onto an announce table, but the table doesn't break. In the end, Kurt wins after making Shawn tap out to the ankle lock. 5/5Sumo Match: Akebono Vs. Big Show: It wasn't exactly my cup of tea seeing Show in a sumo outfit, but the match was good. Short and sweet, with Show actually lifting Akebono up, but Show is tossed out of the ring. Akebono wins. 3/5 WWE Championship Match: John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield (c) Vs. John Cena: JBL makes his best entrance yet, with a police motorcade escorting him to the ring and ""In JBL We Trust"" 100 dollar bills (w/ JBL's face on them) falling from the ceiling. JBL actually carries the Doctor Of Thuganomics through most of the match. Cena makes a late comeback in the end of the match and ends up winning the WWE title!!! WTF was WWE thinking!? They let JBL beat everyone else over the past 9+ months, but let him lose in a 12 minute match!? I was actually rooting for JBL. Well, JBL can always get the belt back in the future. 4/5 (minus a point since Cena won) World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (c) Vs. Batista: This is a little better than the JBL/Cena match since I like Batista more than Cena. Like the Angle/Michaels match, this goes back and forth. Flair even interferes a few times. WHOOOOOOO!! LOL Anyway, after reversing an attempted Pedigree on the steel steps, Batista busts H-Boy open catapulting him into the ring post. H-Boy hits a low blow on Batista while the ref deals w/ Flair. He goes for another Pedigree, but Batista is too strong and forces his arms free. Dave then nails a bloody H-Boy to the mat w/ a piledriver-esque move. H-Boy's 10th World Heavyweight Title reign comes to an end after Batista hits him w/ a Batista-bomb for the 3-count. Batista celebrates in the ring as pyro goes off around the ceiling. Your winner and NEW World Heavyweight Champion, Batista!!! 5/5",1112918400,,4168,4.5809906291834
2194174,4,B0006SSNXW,"What was ironic about this Wrestlemania was that the matches that everyone expected to be incredible wound up being decent, while the matches that everyone thought would suck, turned out to be incredible. So I'm just going to write about the matches that really stand out in my mind.

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton ***1/2: Great ring psychology to start off with Orton using his quickness around Undertaker. ""Cowboy"" Orton running in (as I thought he would) definitely added something to the match. I really liked how Orton came across in the match, as someone totally obsessed with ending the streak... and he came sooo close. Moment of the night (at least for me) when Orton countered the Chokeslam in mid-air into the RKO. The crowd was definitely into this one.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match ***1/2: Considering all the men involved (seven including Tomko), the chemistry was really good. Everyone stood out, but especially Benjamin. With two UNBELIEVABLE spots including a T-Bone off a ladder on Edge and the run up one ladder to clothesline Y2J who was on top of another ladder, Benjamin really made the match. Some great ring psychology with Benoit, who had the match won, but couldn't reach the briefase because his arm was crushed by Kane earlier in the match.

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels ****: They said it would steal the show, and it did. A few awkward spots (like when the table didn't break on Shawn's dive, ouch) keep it from being a 5-star match, but it was match of the night for sure. It seemed like HBK was trapped in the Ankle Lock forever and as a fan of his, I was literally on the edge of my seat. I don't get that excited when I'm watching TV, so you know it had to be good.",1112918400,,1704,4.562091503267974
2194175,4,B0006SSNXW,"With the theme of Wrestlemania going Hollywood with funny movie spoof trailers and all this show was one of the most excited shows of this year along with Royal Rumble 2005 but it did have some bad spots.

Here goes my review.

Eddie Guerrereo vs. Rey Mysterio

Good match not one of their best. It would've been better if Rey didn't worry about his mask so much.

6 man Money in The Bank Ladder Match : Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Chris Benoit vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho- This was an awesome match and Shelton Benjamin was the MVP in this match delievring the T-Bone Suplex from the ladder!

Legend vs Legend Killer

The Undertaker vs Randy Orton

Great match and Undertaker keeps his undefeated winning streak going 13-0! ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton makes a surprise appereance and gets his ass kick by the Deadman. Randy Orton tried to killed the legend of The Undertaker but what Randy Orton just learned is that you can't kill what's already dead!

Women's Title Match

Christy Hemme vs. Trish Stratus

OK Match I'd love Christy outfit but it wasn't all that great of a woman's match I except Lita turn heel and turned on Christy during this match but it didn't happan.

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels

This match has been a dream match of mine for a long time and it was great to see it! It starts off with resthold but it's goes fast the match goes by. This match stoled the show and Kurt Angle won with the anklelock!

Piper's Pit with special guest Stone Cold.

First of all it was great to see Piper and Stone Cold back. Also Carlito comes in and interrupts Piper and Stone Cold and tells them that they are aruging like a bunch of a little girls lol. Carlito kicks Pipers ass on his own show but Stone Cold saves Pipers ass and kicks his ass but Stone Cold also kicks Pipers ass giving him a Stone Cold Stunner!

Sumo Match Big Show vs. Akebono

one word sums of this match Boring!

WWE Championship

JBL vs. John Cena

Not very good I liked JBL entrence at the beginning. John Cena wins a 10 minute match up and he is now our WWE Champion! Why Vince why? Cena Sucks!

World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. HHH

Much longer than the WWE title match. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but Batista wins the match with a Batista bomb and becomes our new World Heavyweight Champion. It's good to see the belt off HHH but I hope Batista title reign is not cut short.

Overall not a bad Wrestlemania I liked this show espacially with the surprise of Hulk Hogan and Eugene when Hulk Hogan himself kicked Hassan ass all over the staples center! Hulk Still Rulz!",1112918400,,2585,4.395789473684211
2194176,4,B0006SSNXW,"Okay, the 2005 installment of wrestlemania was, in my opinon, one of the better ones. I wouldn't quite rank it in my top 5 (WM's X7, III, XIX, XIV, and X) but it's fairly close, with some VERY good matches, some good matches, one or two 'meh' matches, and some bigtime let downs.

Eddie Guererro v. Rey Mysterio **3/4-- Not the best effort from the two, but certainly passable. Rey seemed to be struggling with his new mask and both seemed very nervous and preoccupied. A good match, albiet it's a much slower match then you'd normally be used to seeing these two in. Still a strong opener.

Money In the Bank Ladder Match
Edge v. Chris Benoit v. Christian v. Kane v. Jericho v. Benjamin
***1/4
These six really tried hard to put on a hell of a show and certainly delivered. Edge of course participates minimally but escapes with the fairly predictable win. Christian and Benoit bump, Jericho carried the mic work heading into the fued and Kane was the one administering the bumps. Shelton Benjamin looks like the stud in this match though. He rips off a Paul London spot from Ring of Honor's 2002 show ""uncensored"" by literally running UP a ladder, but it's still cool no less.

The Undertaker v. Randy Orton ***-- I have to say this match certainly delivered a hell of a lot more then I expected it to. These two really put on a pretty decent performance considering Taker is usually as slow as molassas and Orton's face turn was a complete disaster. This may be the best pulled off 'quick' feud in WWE history. For it's thrown together fashion, the feud delivered and suprisingly, so did the match.

WWE Women's Championship
Christy Hemme v. Trish Stratus *--- This match was pretty much Trish carrying a horrifically green Christy to a passable women's match. I'm all for Christy learning to wrestle, i'm just not wild about the idea of her taking the place of Molly and or Victoria on this card. Regardless though, the right decision was made and Trish went over.

Kurt Angle v. HBK ****1/2-- This match is probobly more like ****1/4's but what puts this match over to a near perfect score to me is the fact that it really shut up naysayers. Angle and HBK pulled off a near five star match without doing ANYTHING stupid and worked within the limitations they're physically saddled with. Angle def. did carry this in some spots, but no less, both juiced it up. Great overdue win for Angle.

Piper's Pit

Not too great of a segment. Nice to see Roddy. Austin I could have done without. Carlito was sent out to make it a little more funny, but it didn't seem to work. This segment just seemed forced.

Sumo Match
Big Show v. Akebono *-- Nothing to get excited about especially if you hate fat men in thongs. However, I will say I was more entertained then I thought i'd be. Still, this should have MUCH earlier in the show.

WWE Championship Match
John 'Bradshaw' Layfield v. John Cena *1/2-- I really sincerely thought this would be the show stealer this year. This could have been a memorable brawl but 11 minutes just isn't enough time to do much of anything really. JBL controls the majority of the actoin, there's a little exchange, missed CLFH and then Cena hits the FU outta nowhere and it's over. Def. upset me. It's no way to get over your company's brightest future star and send off the guy who's busted his ass for eight months. THE dissapointment of the night.

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H v. Batista ***-- These guys exceeded my expectations for sure. That being said though, it took me ten minutes to REALLY get into this match after the WWE title debacle before it. The last ten minutes are booked as an absolute execution and Triple H sells the beating beautifully. A quality match I must say, which was suprising from these two.

So overall I give this WM a good a bad and an ugly. It's like watching two shows really because of horrendous booking. The first half of the show is outstanding. The last half, well, is lackluster to say the least. I would certainly reccomend this DVD though, despite the main events.",1112918400,,4046,4.566896551724138

Randy Orton is a great wrestler when heel he shows all his potential. The ""Deadman"" Undertaker gimmick is still impressive but I preffer the ""Big Evil"" persona with the bike. Randy RKOing 'Taker was impressive.

First time I really wanted Trish wins a match. There's great female wrestlers in WWE: Victoria, Jazz, Molly in example, WHY Christy?. Trish did all the job.

Good: It was quick.

Bad: Christy.

*Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels (10/10)

It has it ALL. It was the show stealer, these guys did a hell of a job, matches like this one are unforgettable they need a rematch... just one more time. I wanted Shawn Michaels wins but at last I was shouting... ""Tap, Michaels, tap!!!""

Good: Both deserves all the ovations.

Bad: The table didn't broke.

*Big Show vs. Akebono (5/10)

It was an OK match, Akebono looked more experienced.

Good: Interesting watch a ""sumo"" match

Bad: They spent more time watching each other at first.

*WWE Championship (6/10)

A little dissapointed match, Cena is a great performer but even JBL is leagues over him in wrestling. He needs to improves more his skills, IMHO Cena don't deserve a big title as WWE championship yet. He's the champ just because is the most popular wrestler in Smackdown right now, not the best wrestler.

Good: See how Cena kicked Bradshaw's ass.

Bad: Cena's limited moves.

*WHW Championship (8/10)

Batista is the champ, I really really hope Hunter loses several pounds and kick his animal butt. Great HHH's entrance, at first the match was a little slow but was progressing for good. Batista is improving his moves lately but not in this match, still a credible match and he will be an awesome champ with the right opponents. Today Dave was the man, I think Edge is coming...

Hogan/Eugene/Hassan: I LOVE IT. The Hogan ovation long as usual, he deserves it... man, he is inmortal. Real funny and symbolic.

Stone Cold/Roddy Pipper/Carlito: Funny, could be better.",1112486400,2,2576,4.812785388127854
2194181,5,B0006SSNXW,"WM 19 didn't have it, WM 20 didn't have it, but last night, in front of 21,000 plus fans, John Cena and Batista defeated JBL and HHH to become champs of their own brands. This was an awsome ppv, the crowd was electric all night and the matches, several especially were worth it [Except the sumo match in my opinion]

Eddie Guerreroe vs. Rey Mysterio: What a great way to kick off the show, two of the best Latino wrestlers in WWE history use high flying and fast paced action to start it off. Rey wins again and Eddie shows a little teasing of turning on Rey, but then shakes his hand in a great match. 8.5/10

Edge vs Kane vs Benoit vs Jericho vs Christian vs. Shelton B.
Ladder Match
#1 contendership:

Wow, wow, wow. Just a famous match that people will remember for years to come. The things these guys did to each other took guts and preserverance. Shelton giving Edge the T-Bone suplex off a ladder, Benoit giving Kane a headbutt off a ladder.

Shelton running up the side of a ladder that was laying on another ladder to throw Jericho off was phenominal. Then Edge and Christian gave a modified conchairto to Kane with ladders, followed by Shelton jumping out of the ring to land on at least 5 other guys, Tomko included.

Edge wins after hitting Benoit with a chair and taking him out. Benoit's arm suffered the most after Kane gave him several arm crunches with a ladder on it. Truly a great match. 10/10

Randy Orton vs. Undertaker
Legend vs. Legend Killer.

Its official, 13-0  is now the new record that the Undertaker has. A great match again, with Randy reversing a chokeslam into a RKO, then his dad interfering, but the Undertaker prevailing was  a great exciting match.

I saw a lot of signs that said 12-1 over the past few weeks, but let me just say no one can beat the Undertaker at a WM, just get used to that! 9/10

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme
Women's championship:

I can't say this was great, but props to Christy to actually going out there with not much experience in front of millions of people and actually trying to be good. As you could tell, Trish wins to continue her streak.

I had a feeling Lita might have been a big factor, but she just mostly glared at Trish the entire time. 6/10

Eugene/Hassan/Hogan segment:
Just to pass the time and give the Hulkster to pump up the crowd. Eugene came out and started talking about his favorite moment [When midgets attacked King Kong Bundy] Then Hassan came out to beat up Eugene and make a WM moment of his own.

Then Hogan to the rescue, cleaning house and posing in front of a televised American flag. Funny, and memorable stuff.

Kurt Angle vs. HBK:

30 minutes of pure enjoyment and captivating action. All the near falls made the crowd shout and yell like crazy. A bad spot when HBK tried to jump on Angle through an announce table, but the table didn't break.

Lots of chain wrestling, near falls, a great sweet chin music by HBK, and a moonsault gone bad, followed by chemistry and drama made this the greatest match on the card!

Other than that, this is definately the match of the year, hell the match of the decade! Angle wins after making HBK tap out, only becoming the third man to make him tap. [The first was Jericho, the second Benoit]  11/10

Piper's Pit
Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest:
Didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. Some good trading of words by both men, with Piper making fun of the crowd with the what chants. Then Carlito of all people comes out and makes fun of them.

Piper gets beat up by Carlito by about 10 seconds as Austin watched, then Austin and Piper beat up Carlito. They celebrate with beers and then Austin stuns Piper. Some funny stuff, would have made a great Raw also!

Sumo Match: Why, why, WHY was this match on so late in the card? I certainly didn't want to see two big men in practically no clothing fight after one of the greatest one on one matches in history, or after the awsome ladder match. Anyway Akebono wins and Big Show falls to the outside of the ring. 5/10

WWE Championship
JBL vs. John Cena:

The streak is over! We have a new Smackdown champion! The match was also a disappointment, only 15 minutes, maybe even less long. Cena hits the FU out of nowhere and pins JBL. I am not complaining though. Good match, for the ending, not great. 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs. HHH

Motorhead played HHH's music as he entered from a trap door in the stage. Motorhead wasn't as good as they were from WM 17, but the entrance was still cool.

The crowd erupted when Batista won. HHH got busted wide open, Ric  Flair got spinebustered, and Batista is the new world champ. About twenty minutes of big man fighting, lots of struggle holds and knocking people down. Batista celebrated as the crowd went crazy. 9/10

This year's WM was definately worth it, especially for the Angle/HBK match, Orton/Undertaker match, the Ladder match, and the two world title matches just for the endings. I can't wait for May 10th!

I just got the DVD also and what a bunch of extras they have:

All nine parodys of the several of the most famous scenes in movie history.

When Harry met Sally
Taxi Driver
Pulp Fiction
Braveheart

These were the best ones [my opinion]

They also have the highlights of Kurt Angle, Shawn Michales, and the Undertaker. With HBK they showed how his Sweet Chin Music kick can be devastating. With Angle they showed the Ankle lock, and with the Undertaker, they showed all his 12 wins at WM going from 12 to 1 backwards.

The extra Battle Royal is a great thing to add to this DVD. Funny moment when 5 or 6 guys hold down Viscera when Scotty gives him the worm. Heidenreich rips open the padding on the top turnbuckle, and Akio gets face planted on the steel steps after being tossed out of the ring! Booker T wins for Smackdown 8.5/10

They also have when the WWE takes over Hollywood Boulevard with a ring and matches galore. Cena even stops traffic and gets in trouble with the cops. Finally, they have a two and a half hour induction ceremony of the Hall of Fame [But you guys already know that don't ya?]

This is a great DVD to add to your collection.",1112486400,15,6122,4.428189116859946

In what figures to be one of the highest-profile match between two Latinos in the history of wrestling, Eddie Guerrero will face Rey Mysterio at WrestleMania 21.

Ironically, both men currently share the WWE Tag Team Championship. However, for one night, their egos and amazing athletic ability will overshadow their loyalty for each other in what figures to be an unforgettable encounter.

Chavo Guerrero actually planted the seeds for this match over the last few weeks. Chavo teased Eddie that Mysterio had been stealing Latino Heat's spotlight for some time now. He even brought up the fact that at last year's WrestleMania Eddie was WWE Champion.

Eddie, never one to take a back seat to any Superstar, decided the time was right to challenge his good friend. Mysterio accepted on the March 24 edition of SmackDown!, promising Eddie and the fans that they would tear the roof off the STAPLES Center on April 3.

Don't miss WrestleMania to find out how this battle of Latino legends turns out.

BIG SHOW VS. AKEBONO

It all started in early February when SmackDown! visited Japan and former Sumo Grand Champion Akebono was in attendance.

Big Show invited Akebono to the ring, but there was no animosity on this night as both giants exchanged a respectful handshake.

A few weeks later, Funaki, SmackDown!'s proclaimed No. 1 announcer, tracked Big Show down backstage and told him word out of Japan was that Akebono wanted to face Show at WrestleMania 21 on April 3 in Los Angeles.

Then, on the March 10 edition of SmackDown!, Big Show told Josh Mathews that he gladly accepted the challenge, even though it will be a Sumo style match, something that figures to give Akebono a major edge.

As a result of Big Show's acceptance, WWE fans are now in store for the largest match in WrestleMania history. Heading into the match, Show admits that he may be out of his element. But Akebono, according to Big Show, is the only man on the planet that the Sumo champion cannot push around.

Don't miss WrestleMania 21, live on pay-per-view, to see how this collision of International giants turns out.

RANDY ORTON VS. THE UNDERTAKER

Just ask Randy Orton and he'll tell you that he is a legend killer. The list of greats that he has taken out with his patented RKO contains the biggest names in the history of sports-entertainment, including Mick Foley, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Jake ""the Snake Roberts and Hall of Famers Sgt. Slaughter and Harley Race.

Now, however, Orton has propelled himself into a position where he will take on one of the most legendary figures of all time - Undertaker! Can the Legend Killer actually defeat the legend at WrestleMania 21?

In addition to Undertaker's amazingly intimidating aura, the Deadman also boasts the greatest WrestleMania recod ever, a whopping 12-0. Undertaker's dozen victories did not come against just anybody, either. Take a look at some of the greats Undertaker has toppled en route to his perfect record:

WrestleMania VII: Hall of Famer Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka

WrestleMania VIII: Jake ""the Snake"" Roberts

WrestleMania IX: Giant Gonzales

WrestleMania XI: King Kong Bundy

WrestleMania XII: Diesel

WrestleMania 13: Sid

WrestleMania XIV: Kane

WrestleMania XV: Big Boss Man

WrestleMania X-Seven: Triple H

WrestleMania X8: Ric Flair

WrestleMania XIX: Big Show & A-Train

WrestleMania XX: Kane

WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP

Trish Stratus will be quick to tell you that she is the greatest Women's Champion of all time. And with six reigns under her belt, it's hard to argue with her.

On Sunday, April 3, live on pay-per-view, Trish will put the Women's Championship on the line against newcomer Christy Hemme.

Ever since Christy announced that she was going to be featured nude in the April issue of Playboy Magazine, Trish has focused all of her attention on making the fiery redhead's life miserable. Trish even went so far as to knock Christy out cold with a Chick Kick and spray paint the word SLUT on her back.

With a limited wrestling background, Christy appears to be an easy target for Trish. So much so that Trish thought Christy was joking when the Playboy cover girl challenged her.

Will Christy's training with Lita pay off at WrestleMania? Or will Trish once again prove why she claims to be the greatest Women's Champion of all time? Watch WrestleMania 21 to find out.

MONEY-IN-THE-BANK LADDER MATCH

With some of the biggest matches in WrestleMania history already named, Chris Jericho decided to make some waves of his own.

After defeating Maven on Monday Night RAW, Y2J provided a rather cryptic message concerning his idea for WrestleMania. According to Jericho, his idea is a chance of a lifetime, and it includes five other elite Superstars. And finally, Jericho proclaimed that it includes a large steel ladder.

Despite Y2J's announcement, there were still numerous questions left unanswered. Who else would compete in the match? What is the chance of a lifetime Jericho was referring to?

These questions were cleared up the following week on RAW when General Manager Eric Bischoff officially announced the Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match. The winner of this match would receive an opportunity at the World Heavyweight Championship. This opportunity could be ""banked"" by the winning Superstar. Over the following 12 months, he could choose to use it whenever he wants, up to and including WrestleMania 22.

Who will compete in this historic match? Using RAW Superstars' past WrestleMania success, Bischoff decided to include Christian, Edge, Chris Benoit, Shelton Benjamin and Kane, as well as Chris Jericho.

Six days prior to WrestleMania 21, Chris Jericho welcomed five of the six ""Money in the Bank"" Ladder Match participants to the Highlight Reel. When the segment disintegrated (Video: 56k | 300k), Bischoff converted it into a six-man tag-team match also featuring Tyson Tomko. The team of Jericho, Chris Benoit and Shelton Benjamin notched the win when in-fighting opened the door for the Walls of Jericho on Tomko. But the winning team didn't emerge unscathed. Benoit was badly cut near his eye from the strength of his own series of headbutts. Afterward, the final Ladder Match combatant, Kane, cleared the ring with a ladder and chokeslams.

Six great Superstars will compete in a match that can only have one winner. Who will it be? Watch WrestleMania 21 to find out.

PIPER'S PIT w/ STONE COLD

On April 2, the legendary ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. One night later at WrestleMania 21, Piper will bring back the famed Piper's Pit interview segment. His guest - Stone Cold Steve Austin.

It has been a year since fans have seen Stone Cold on WWE television. What better place for his triumphant return than on Piper's Pit at the biggest event of the year - WrestleMania?

What will happen when two of the most opinionated Superstars in WWE history have a live mic in their hands at WrestleMania? When WWE.com asked Piper this same question, he simply replied, ""You ain't seen nothin' yet.""

Be sure to order WrestleMania live on pay-per-view, Sunday, April 3, to see these two legends back in WWE.

ANGLE VS. HBK

Shawn Michaels' issues with Kurt Angle date back to January's Royal Rumble. It was at the Rumble that an upset Angle took HBK out of action, eliminating Michaels' opportunity to compete for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.

While Theodore Long was at a recent Monday Night RAW, HBK told the SmackDown! General Manager that he wanted to face Angle at WrestleMania 21. Upon hearing the news, Angle's first reaction was one of absolute silence. Kurt Angle, however, would not stay silent for long.

After Michaels defeated Edge in a grueling Street Fight on a recent edition of RAW, Kurt Angle jumped the ringside barrier and attacked the already beaten and bloody Michaels. After Angle left HBK in a pool of his own blood, he grabbed the microphone and told HBK that he accepted his challenge for a match at WrestleMania 21.

Never one to be outdone, HBK traveled to SmackDown! days later and returned the favor. Disguised as a television camera man, Michaels climbed into the SmackDown! ring and delivered a surprise attack on Angle.

HBK's surprise appearance clearly got under Angle's skin, as the SmackDown! Superstar announced that he was going to accomplish all the things Michaels accomplished during he amazing career. However, Angle said he would do it in just four weeks.

Angle's first test was a Ladder Match, which he accomplished. The Olympic gold medal winner then set out to defeat one-half of the Rockers, Marty Jannetty. Angle was successful in defeating Jannetty, but not before the former Rocker opened many eyes with his timeless wrestling skills.

Angle didn't stop there. The Olympic gold medalist even brought in HBK's former manager Sensational Sherri to sing Michaels' entrance theme with him. The parody ended in Angle applying the ankle lock to Sherri.

Then, with just six days remaining before their WrestleMania showdown, the Olympic Gold Medalist emerged from a RAW crowd in the middle of HBK's match with Muhammad Hassan in an attempt to soften up his WrestleMania opponent. The plan backfired when HBK battled out of an Angle Slam attempt, then barely missed with ""Sweet Chin Music."" When Angle bailed from the ring, Michaels settled for a superkick to the chin of Hassan. Security guards eventually separated Angle and Michaels, but there will be no one to come between them at the pay-per-view on April 3.

Clearly, the animosity between these two WWE Superstars has reached the boiling point. But have we seen the last of the physicality between Angle and HBK until WrestleMania? What will happen when these two finally square off in the middle of the ring? Continue watching RAW and SmackDown! for more on this developing story.

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP

John Cena last eliminated Kurt Angle in a grueling eight-man tournament to become the No. 1 contender to JBL's WWE Championship. As a result, the self-proclaimed Doctor of Thugamonics will now face JBL at WrestleMania 21.

If the former United States Champion can recreate the magic that carried him over the mighty Big Show at WrestleMania XX, SmackDown! may be in store for at new WWE Champion on April 3.

JBL, however, is not likely to sit back and let Cena walk all over him. Like him or not, JBL demands respect. By the time WrestleMania comes around, JBL will have held the WWE Championship longer than any other man in past 10 years (277 days). Many of sports-entertainment's greatest names have captured the WWE Championship. But over the past decade, nobody has been able to hold on to it longer than JBL, not Stone Cold Steve Austin, not Shawn Michaels, not Undertaker and not Bret Hart. Clearly, this is a feat that demands respect.

In addition to JBL's lengthy championship reign, he has also managed to get a psychological strangle hold on Cena in the weeks leading up to their WrestleMania encounter. On the March 3, edition of SmackDown!, JBL hit Cena with his WWE Championship, allowing Chief of Staff Orlando Jordan to get the victory over Cena for the coveted United States Championship.

To make matters even worse for Cena, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long recently announced that the challenger would lose his WrestleMania opportunity if he even touches the champion (unless physically provoked by JBL) prior to their WrestleMania encounter. Following the announcement, JBL has gone to great efforts in an attempt to get Cena to attack him. The champion has even targeted Cena's mother, claiming she has spent much time on her back.

Up until now, Cena has been able to control his temper. But will he be able to do this all the way up until WrestleMania? If so, can he recreate the same WrestleMania magic that carried him over Big Show at last year's event? Or will JBL successfully defend his WWE Championship again, this time, on the biggest stage of them all? Watch WrestleMania 21 to find out.

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

When Triple H and Ric Flair united to create the strongest faction in wrestling today, they knew they needed to bring somebody in as their heavy. They needed somebody with immense strength and an animalistic instinct in the ring. With those qualities in mind, they tapped RAW newcomer Batista in January 2003 to join them in Evolution.

The addition of Batista proved to be a wise one. In addition to ensuring Triple H's status as the World Heavyweight Champion, Batista also teamed with Ric Flair to capture the World Tag Team Championship on two occasions.

For two long years, Batista and Triple H, along with Ric Flair, stood united as the strongest force on RAW. During this time, Batista learned from the best, watching every move of The Game and 16-time World Champion Ric Flair. Then, 24 months after their formation, Evolution began to crumble. It all started at the 2005 Royal Rumble when Batista last eliminated John Cena, earning a World Championship match at WrestleMania 21.

Realizing the huge opportunity in front on him, Batista took several weeks to decide which championship he wanted to compete for at WrestleMania -- The WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship.

During this time, World Heavyweight Champion and fellow Evolution member Triple H took it upon himself to try and sway Batista's decision towards SmackDown! and the WWE Championship. At first, The Game arranged for SmackDown! Superstars JBL and Big Show to appear on the TitanTron above the RAW entranceway. Both SmackDown! Superstars made malicious comments towards Batista, designed to get The Animal to choose SmackDown! over RAW.

Triple H even went so far as to have Batista nearly run down by JBL's limo. Eventually, all of this information found its way back to Batista, which made his decision all that much easier. However, it should be noted that Batista claims to have made his decision well before these acts began.

Batista then went on to decimate both The Nature Boy and The Game, highlighted by a Batista Bomb delivered to Triple H through a table. Batista then signed the RAW contract and told a fallen Game that he would take the World Heavyweight Championship from him at WrestleMania 21.

Seven days after Batista signed on to face Triple H, who will be competing in his 10th straight WrestleMania, at WrestleMania 21, The Game sent a message to his challenger by dismantling The Hurricane on RAW. Later in the evening, Evolution interrupted Batista's Q&A with Jim Ross. But when Ric Flair charged the ring, Triple H balked. As a result, ""The Nature Boy"" suffered through a spinebuster and Batista Bomb while The Game was frenzied outside the ring.

The following week, Batista once again sent a strong message to the World Heavyweight Champion. Not only did the big man defeat the legendary Ric Flair, but he also got a hold of Triple H's signature sledgehammer and broke it in half over his knee.

Then, with just six days before their WrestleMania encounter, Triple H and Batista had a final face-to-face showdown on RAW - meeting in a war of words orchestrated by RAW General Manager Eric Bischoff. But what started as trash-talk broke down into a six-pier brawl.

Bischoff was intent on preventing the ""Face-off"" encounter from getting out of hand. He surrounded the ring with security guards and warned both men against any physicality. It didn't matter. Batista was able to set off the Cerebral Assassin with comments that hit a little too close to home, resulting in The Game slapping Batista across the face. It was the beginning of the end of Bischoff's in-ring conference - as the two Superstars battled through a mass of humanity to tear into each other. It was just a taste of the ferocity that can be expected when they square off with the stakes at their highest at the biggest event of the year -- WrestleMania 21.

Will Triple H be able to walk away from WrestleMania with the World Heavyweight Championship? Or will their be a new leader on RAW in Batista? Watch WrestleMania live on pay-per-view to find out.",1112140800,,16087,4.938798219584569

I think this match will open up Wrestlemania, to get the crowd pumped. I see Eddie winning because Rey has beaten twice already and I cant see Eddie going down three times.

Um, never seen a sumo match, so don't know.  It is going to be boring either way.

3. Christy w/Lita vs. Trish (Woman's title)

I think Trish will win, I can't see Christy first title shot match and her coming out on top.  I think they will have a rematch at Backlash and she will win then.

One of the matches of the night.  I see Angle coming out on top.  I hate him so much, but i think he will counter the Sweet Chin Music into the Anglelock, stupid name, for the win.

5. Money in the bag ladder match.

Antoher contender for match of the night.  I think Jericho will win because he has never lost a ladder match, i think.  My second pick is Kane because he is been on a roll.  Either way this will be an great match.

6. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

This shouldn't even be close.  I use to like Randy until he started with the whole concusion thing (back at the Rumble). If Taker doesn't win this match then there is something seriously wrong with the WWE because he has beaten Triple H, Flair, Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Kane.  Anyway Taker will hit the Tombstone for the win. ( have you notice RKO is Randy Orton's initals.)

7. John Cena vs. JBL (WWE title)

I think Cena is going to win, if he doesn't then JBL will lose at Jugment Day.  Cena will hit the FU and score the 3 but Orlando will put JBL's foot on the bottom rope and the ref will think it was there the whole time.  So the match will be restarted. It goes on for maybe 5 min. then Cena will hit the FU and score the win again.

8. Batista vs. triple h (World Title)

As long as it doesn't turn into a Goldberg Vs. Lesnar match like last year, this will be a great match.  Batista will win because every Rumble winner,except the Rock, has won the title.  I think someone will go through the announce table.",1112054400,,2008,4.105670103092783

2194195,5,B0006SSNXW,"This will be a blockbuster PPV, and will most likely be more expensive than any other PPV that has taken place before.

This year's WrestleMania has the theme of Hollywood; the trailers for the PPV have been send ups of Hollywood films, plus the actual PPV itself will take place in Hollywood.

It seems that every WWE superstar is going to be taken to their very best this year in what they do. Fopr instance, Randy Orton's 'Legend killer' characteristic is to be tested by one of the biggest legends of all time.

The matches, as of now, are as follows:

Sumo Match:

Big Show vs. Akebono

Do not expect a great deal of this match. I'm sure the Big Show will be at his best, but the match is purely to get Big Show involved with WrestleMania.

Women's Championship:

Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme

This will probably be the best woman's match possible as of now.

I am sure Lita will make an appearance.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match:

Jericho vs. Benoit vs. Benjamin vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Kane

All of these men have been in great ladder (or TLC) matches, except Shelton. Expect Edge and Christian to team up for a bit.

Legend vs Legend Killer:

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Undertaker has never been beaten at WrestleMania. And I don't think he will now.

Piper's Pit with Stone Cold:

Anthing could happen, but I would expect Stone Cold to beat the hell out of Roddy Piper and drink a few beers.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle:

Undeniably, this will be a dream match. For some reason, I keep imagining Kurt reversing the Sweet Chin Music into the Ankle lock.

WWE Championship:

JBL vs. John Cena

There has been great build up to this: JBL has been acting kind of posh with his paintings and ceromonies; whereas Cena is a rapper, and smashes the painting over JBL's head. This is a match between two opposites.

World Championship:

Triple H vs. Batista

This, in my opinion, has the best build up for an event ever. Don't expect this to be poor. Triple H is strong enough to take Batista on in an action-packed fight. HHH is also light enough to be thrown around the ring. This will be a great match.

Also, expect to see RVD, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio and Hollywood Hulk Hogan; but, sadly, the Rock is probably just as likely to show up as Bret Hart.",1110672000,,2271,4.462287104622871

Here's my perdictions what the matches will be .............

  JBl vs. John Cena

  john cena will win hopefully

  Batista vs. Triple H

  I would like Batista to win. But here is why, This is like Batista's second mania,The will probably have Batista win at Backlash.

  Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

  Go Michaels!!! he is my favorite wrestler of all time.

  Money in the bank match

  Chris Jerico will probably win or Edge. Kane doesnt do ladder matches. Sad that they won't have an interconntal match at wrestlemania. In the book that Edge wrote he said that he would stop doing ladder matches. So don't expect a lot from him.

  U.S title match

  Orlando vs. Booker T

  I would like Booker to win but someone will interfere.

  Big Show vs. Akebono

  It might happen but it probably won't deliver.

  Hogan vs. Muhhamad Hassen

  Again could happen I want to see Hassen get his back side handed to him.

  Piper's pit

  If Muhhamad doesnt wrestle Hogan he will come out during Piper's pit and mess up the show but Stone Cold will beat the crap out of Hassen.

  Christy vs. Trish

  I don't care how much training Christy gets she won't be able to beat Trish.

  Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker

  If Orton beats Taker it will be because of the Lengend Killer thing. If taker wins it will be because Taker is awesome.

  Heidenrich vs. Gene Snicksky

  Snitsky will win.

  Posssible other matches

  WWE tag championship

  World tag championship

  Cruiserweight championship

  Chevo vs. Paul London

  and other matches.

  The Rock will probably appear during the event.",1110412800,,1650,4.6521739130434785

Jbl vs John Cena- Cena is a boring wrestler and he dosen't deserve the title JBL will win.

Randy Ortan vs Undertaker- Since Randy Ortan is the legend killer he should beat the Undertaker.

Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit,Christian, Shelton Benajamin,Hassan,and maybe Edge? in a ladder match- A Ladder Match is perfect for Mania. Hopefully jericho will win.

Trish Stratus vs Christy Hemme- I am not sure if this will happen. This Match will suck.

The Bashams vs Rey Mysterio and Eddie Gurrero- Bashams will hopefully win.

SHAWN MICHAELS VS KURT ANGLE- Best match of the night shawn michaels will win and show smackdown that raw is better!

Chavo Guerrero vs Paul London- Paul London is exciting to watch and should win the belt.

Kane vs Snitsky in a Buried Alive Match- Kane is a real good wrestler will be a very good match kane will win.

...I'll update this when I find out more rumored matches",1107043200,,385,5.47457627118644
2194221,5,B0006SSNXW,"Even with all of the hype of Wrestlemania 20, lest face it, in the end it didn't live up to the hype. Apart from the triple threat world heavyweight title match the other matches were o.k. however I believe that if the WWE are as clever as they make they are then they will try to make Wrestlemaina 21 the biggest one yet. This means big hype, big matches and major superstars returning to the squared circle once again. I also think that the cross-over promotional matches from last year were an excellent idea and should happen again at Wrestlemania 21. Last year there were three matches, Kane Vs Undertaker, Brock Lesnar Vs Goldberg and the divas match.

Here are the matches that I would like to see at Wrestlemania 21:

Match 1: Fatal-4-Way for the U.S Title

Rey Mysterio vs. RVD vs. Eddie Gurrerro vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool (Champion)

This will be an excellent opener with lots of high flying moves and fast paced action. There should be a part at the end of the match where Rey and Carlito are down and so Eddie does the frog splash on Carlito at the same time as RVD does the 5 star frog splash on Rey and so both go for the cover at the same time and the referee does not know who to count for. I would like RVD to win this match as he truly deserves a major title and not just the tag team titles. (The match would be a 5/5 rating)

Match 2: WWE Women's Championship Match

Trish Stratus vs. Lita (Champ)

I must admit I always thought that women's matches only took place for the divas to show off but I was surprised when I saw Lita vs. Trish on Raw (6th December). The match was actually quite entertaining with some close pin falls and some cool moves by either woman, though saying that Lita still needs to improve on her in ring movement as it is still quite sloppy. Anyway their Raw match was good let's hope that if they wrestle again at Wrestlemania it is a better match. (Should; be a 3/5 rating).

Match 3: Inter-promotional Match - Iron Man Match

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

These two have had many matches over the years some were instant classics (ultimate submission) and some were not. But these two are still two of the best technical wrestlers alive today and I believe would make an amazing Ironman match. This rivalry would begin at the Royal Rumble where Angle is being interviewed and is claming to be the best wrestler in the WWE today and as always boasting about his Gold Medals when Benoit interrupts the interview and begins to insult Angle. Angle then claims that he will win the royal rumble and win the WWE Title at Wrestlemania 21. Benoit laughs and asks Angle about how last year (Wrestlemania 20) how he won the Royal Rumble even though he came in number one and then went on to win the World Heavyweight Title whereas on the same night Angle lost to Eddie Gurrerro because of his boot slipping off. Benoit laughs at how Angle has not won the title since and has not even been in a WWE title match. They both argue and then in the Rumble Benoit Eliminates Angle. Then Angle comes back in and hits Benoit with a chair. After the rumble Angle interferes in Benoit's matches on Raw. The rivalry continues when Benoit causes Angle to lose his match at No Way Out. Then Angle demands Vince to make the match and so the iron man match is made.

The match itself will be excellent with Angle tapping out to cross face and Benoit to the Anklelock. I would like Benoit to win the match  (Match would be a 5/5 rating).

Match 4: Fatal-4-way Ladder match for the Intercontinental Title.

Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin (champion)

This will obviously be one of the best matches of the night. Lots of excitement that happens in ladder matches and the ladder is used in many innovative ways to bust the superstars open. Jericho does the walls of Jericho on Christian on top of the ladder. Also when Christian is hanging from the title Edge does a flying spear from the top rope. Jericho does a moonsault from the ladder to Edge through a table. Jericho wins the match and becomes the intercontinental champ for the eighth time. (Defiantly would be 5/5 and one of the best ladder matches ever)

Match 5: Triple H vs. The Rock

The Rock returns just before Wrestlemania as he did last year and as he usually does will insult Triple H. This match was set up when Eugene told The Rock that Triple H is his favourite wrestler but because of the Rocks Hollywood career it was left undeveloped. But hopefully these two will build a rivalry until Eric Bishoff makes the match and it should be a good match but not the best of the night. Triple H has lost some of his in ring ability and can sometime underperform. I would want Tripe H to win as I can't stand The Rock (3/5 rated match)

Match 6: World Tag Team Title Match - A 3-team tag team turmoil.

Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance vs. Eugene & William Regal (champions)

Should be a normal tag team match with Eugene doing his usual frolicking around. Hopefully Rhyno and Tajiri will win, as they truly deserve them. (2/5 rating)

Match 8: WWE Cruiserweight Title Match

Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman (champion - after beating Funaki on Smackdown)

These two hate each other to the max and after Chavo's return from his injury; have not yet been in a singles match so Chavo has not got his true revenge on Kidman for what he did to him. This will be an excellent match with highflying moves and lots of close pin falls. Kidman will hit the shooting start press but Chavo will kick out of the pin. Chavo will hit the gori-bomb but Kidman will kick out. Finally Chavo will do the shooting start press, pin Kidman and win the title as well as getting his revenge. (4/5 rating)

Match 9: WWE Tag Team Title Match - 4 team Tag Team Turmoil

Dudley Boys vs. Hardcore Holly & Daniel Puder vs. Rene Dupree & Kenzo Suzuki vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak (champions)

Should be a better than the Raw Tag team title matches with more intense fighting. Luther will dominate and there will be some close pin falls. Luther and Jindrak should retain the titles but I think Hardcore Holly & Puder will win so that WWE can boost the promotion of Daniel Puder as a real wrestler. (3/5 match)

Match 10: Booker T vs. JBL

This match would take place because Booker T would come out on Smackdown and make fun of JBL for losing the title to Undertaker at No Way Out. JBL would get his cabinet to attack Booker T. Theodore Long would make a tag match on Smackdown being JBL & Orlando Jordan vs. Undertaker & Booker T. JBL would cheat and pin Booker T causing Booker to demand a match against JBL at Wrestlemania. (To be honest I don't think this match will really happen I'm just saying it, as I have not put them in a match yet) If the match happened will be better than their Survivor Series match and will be an o.k. Match. I would want Booker T to win, as JBL is getting boring now. (Should be a 3/5 rating)

Match 11: Last man Standing Match

Batista vs. Kane

I've always wanted these two to have a proper match with no interferences. Even though they have had matches in the past they have usually been interrupted or someone has helped Batista to win and so these two have not had a proper match. I believe that these two are of equal strength and power and so could make an excellent last man standing match. A normal match would not be enough for what these two can truly do to each other. This rivalry will start at the Royal Rumble where Batista Impressively Lifts Kane up in the air and throws him out of the ring. Kane will get furious and will go back in and the two will start to fight until Kane is forced out by the referees. The rivalry will continue to develop on Raw week after week as both say they are better and bigger than the other. Bishoff will then say that the bigger and better man will be the man who is the last man standing at Wrestlemania 21. This match itself should be a classic and in the words of JR "" a true slobberknocker"". There will be no Interference, as Evolution would have already split up by the Royal Rumble. Both men will be busted open and Kane will Choke slam Batista through the Spanish Announce table. This should be long match. I would like Batista to win and be the last man standing as I believe he is better than Kane. (4/5 Should be a Brutal and awesome match)

Match 11: Inter-promotional Match

Randy Orton vs. John Cena

For some reason I believe that this match will defiantly take place at Wrestlemania 21 and I will be quite surprised if it doesn't. These two came into the WWE at roughly the same time and are almost the same age. They are both young and are excellent athletes; they both are very popular with the fans and are worthy of being in main events. I also remember that there was a confrontation between these two backstage at a recent PPV but I'm not sure which one. I believe this match has already been promoted, if you have played the new video game Smackdown Vs Raw then you would know that in the beginning intro we here JR shouting ""oh my god its Raw Vs Smackdown"" and we see Orton and Cena fighting in the ring. I believe that if this match happened it will a superb match with close falls and some awesome wrestling. Orton would be on the top rope and would do his trademark splash but Cena will catch him on his shoulders and do the FU. I wouldn't care who wins that match as in my view both are as good as each other and both deserve to win. (Would be a 5/5 rated match)

Match 11: WWE Title Match - Triple threat match

Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (champion)

Ok... o.k...  I know why Brock Lesnar? But I would not have included him if not for one thing. I saw Armageddon 2004 two days before I wrote this review and if you remember in the 3-on-1-handicap match Big show used an F-5 to pin Mark Jindrak and win. Now this may be just me but why would they make Big Show use an F-5 all of a sudden, WWE don't usually do this unless there is a specific reason. In my view this usually means two things: 1 being that Brock has defiantly left WWE for good and so his finisher was given to Big Show permanently, or 2 for causing a storyline in which Brock makes his return. Brock would show up at the Royal Rumble and eliminate the Big Show. Then these two would argue for who should face Undertaker at Wrestlemania 21 for the WWE title. They would have singles match at No Way Out, which Lesnar would win, but by cheating. Theodore Long would settle the argument by making this triple threat match for Wrestlemania 21. The match will be excellent with all three superstars giving their best. Taker would tombstone Lesnar but Lesnar will kick out. Big Show will double chokeslam on Lesnar and Taker though the Smackdown Announce table. This will be a good long match, and I would want Undertaker to win as he deserves to remain the champion for longer, and plus he would continue his Wrestlemania winning streak. (Should be a 5/5 rating match).

BUT: if Lesnar doesn't not return then it would be Big Show vs. Undertaker and would still be a good match.

Match 12: World Heavyweight Title Match - Hell In A Cell

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels (champion)

I know... I know a dream match... is very unlikely for it to actually happen, but come on you know if it did it would probably be the match of the night. Even if it was not a Hell in A cell and just a singles match it would still be amazing. This is how I think this match would be set up. Shawn Michaels will return on Raw and would win the vacated World heavyweight Title by beating Edge (this would allow him to get the title as well as having his revenge on Edge for costing him the title at Taboo Tuesday). Then at the Royal Rumble Stone Cold Steve Austin would make his shocking return by knocking out Christian and taking his place in the Rumble match. He would win the Royal Rumble and so it would mean that he faces Michaels at Wrestlemania. Even though I would prefer it to be a Hell in A cell the match would still be good if it was not. If it is a Hell in A Cell the match will be absolutely amazing. Will be long and very bloody. Both me will give it their all and would be exhausted by the end of the match. They would leave the cell and climb on the top where they fight each other and try to push each other from the top. Austin would DDT Michaels on the top of the cell causing it to break and they would fall in the ring. Both men would be down and then Michaels gets up and sets Austin up for the sweet chin music just as he is going to hit Austin, he blocks it and hits the Stunner. Both men then collapse but Austin manages to fall on top of Michaels and the ref counts three causing Austin to win the World Heavyweight title. Sounds good but is very unlikely to happen. I would want Austin to win because we all want to see him as the champ again. (Would be the best match of the night - 5/5). I think I speak for every WWE fan when I say ""PLEASE WWE MAKE THIS MATCH""

So there it is, Wrestlemania 21 - the way I would make it if I were making the matches. 12 superb matches, some realistic some just plain dream matches but if this happened then it would defiantly be the greatest Wrestlemania of ALL time and by god I mean it.",1104710400,,13204,4.29232006433454

8042748,4,B0006SSNXW,"Wasn't sure about 4 stars or 5--Good show, epic Main Event to close it out; but a lot of stuff to skip or not watch at all. I guess Rey and Eddie as the curtain-jerker was good, nice way to kick it off--then there's ""Money in the Bank"" at Mania; when they did it every year. Always easy to zip past until the winner actually cashes in (Edge, baby).

Randy Orton looked into the eyes of the dragon and lost (obviously), Christy Hemme--at that point--probably wasn't the greatest wrestler, but I'm sure no one really cared (wink). If there was one match to obviously ""steal the show,"" it was no doubt HBK and Angle. No great details about that, just an instant classic.

Of course, having Triple H bleed out to close the show was great, since the match prior wasn't exactly classic. Usually I like JBL and Cena, but something  was a bit lacking, there. In any event, a solid show...",1524787200,,880,4.419753086419753
