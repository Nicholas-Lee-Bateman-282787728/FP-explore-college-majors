7831649,1,6302801222,"I bought this video when it first came out for $30, and took it home with high expectations.  After all, it was produced in the ""Golden Era"" of animation, and was based on the best comic strip ever done.  Boy was I disappointed!  The animation is flat and lifeless.  The characters do nothing but pale, cliched imitations of themselves, and there is NO satire.  I taped an episode of The Munsters over it.  If you like Lil Abner, get one of the book collections of reprints of the strip.  I still think Lil Abner would make a great animated film, if done with the savage wit and gorgeous art featured in the Al Capp original, but even a little kid would be bored by this video.",1071187200,4,677,4.325396825396825
7831650,4,6302801222,"If you are a fan of Lil Abner, you will enjoy seeing Abner, Daisy Mae, Mammy, Pappy, Lonesome Polecat, Hairless Joe being animated and their character traits being kept reasonably well in tact with the comic  strip.
One must give Columbia credit for being honest in their notes  about these cartoons not containing the satire that Lil Abner's creator, Al  Capp put in the strip
Likewise, Columbia have used good sense for the  reasonable price of this video, thus not trying to ""soak"" the  collectors out there.
If they had of, word would have gotten around that  the animation is no way comparable the Warner Brother's animation of the  40's and the storylines are not the best.
These cartoons seem to have  been made by the same company who created the Popeye cartoons of the 40's  with Mammy Yokum being a dead ringer for Popeye and visa versa.
Since I  doubt there have been any other Lil Abner cartoons done, and probably won't  be done again, this is good purchase for a Lil Abner fan who wants to  purchase a few momentos of the strip without having to pay an expensive  ""collectors"" price.
If it was a 10 star rating, it would rate  7/10",954115200,10,1145,4.549019607843137
7831651,5,6302801222,I love this movie! It was funny and I think everyone should get it! You should get it! Lil abner was stupid. Daisy may ditzy and everyone relates to at least one charecter!,930096000,6,172,4.242424242424242
