7447085,5,B015S222SW,"Words cannot describe how beautiful this concert is. We are big fans of Andre Rieu and team for the last 25 years and every year were looking forward to the ""Live in Maastricht"" Blu-Ray. It is not available yet in the U.S. but we could not wait and ordered the Blu-Ray from Amazon Germany. Thank you Andre and all the musicians, technicians and everybody involved for another wonderful concert; it feels like being magically taken to another world where there is peace and love.",1450742400,2,478,4.7023809523809526

7447099,5,B015S222SW,"If you love music and what it means to the soul, Andre Rieu  and his orchestra is a true epiphany!  Classical, contemporary, pop, religious, or folk Andre's arrangements bring a full spectrum of emotion to the listener. Grown men  tear up from just plain felt  joy or a  memory of some  lost love or lifetime experience. When I listen and/or watch Andre's DVD I feel like I am overdosing on a bottle of happiness pills. Andre Rieu's  concert  at Maastricht  is on my bucket list.",1454457600,2,479,4.541176470588235
