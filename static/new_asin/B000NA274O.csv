8175976,5,B000NA274O,"I saw this film many years ago before I really knew anything about Cunningham. I truthfully still don't follow modern dance, but for a music experimenter like myself. It is amazing to get to really peek behind the scenes into the world of John Cage. Getting to hear his speak on many subjects. And then getting to hear about the artists who helped design some of their stage sets. Remember, this is a documentary of a lot of things AND a lot of people. David Tudor makes an appearance, as does Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and a few more.",1251590400,4,543,4.494949494949495
8175977,4,B000NA274O,"This review comes a little late but...better late than never.  It is a marvellous film, VERY John Cage and Merce Cunningham whose collaboration led to some inspirational work among the American avant garde.  It covers most of their collaborative lives and introduces some superb archival footage.  We see John Cage of his ""Lectures on Indeterminacy in Modern Music"" days and many extracts from Merce Cunningham's productions going way back.
The film suffers a little from being on VHS but picture quality and sound are good.  I would sooner have this film like it is than not at all.
I should say that the film may not appeal to those averse to the avant garde and the compositional techniques of these masters, but for the fans of this genre, it's a must.",996969600,15,756,4.748091603053435
