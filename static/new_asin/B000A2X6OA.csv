2352767,5,B000A2X6OA,"The only movie to take a serious and sometimes painful look at the mystical journey ever. Not for the feint of heart, but then neither is the true mystical journey either.

If you are a new ager, like ""The Secret"" and that kind of thing, stay away from this movie, you won't like it, and you won't be able to forget it. It will haunt you and the movie is specifically intended to hurt your feelings. It will feel like a personal attack to you, and, quite frankly, it is.  Is is as much a critique of what passes for spirituality and religion in modern society as it is an investigation of the spiritual journey itself.  No modern movement that declares itself spiritual is left unscathed: New agers, religions, psychadelic counter culture. Probably why it pissed everyone off. But... he may be right... he does point to the way, however - we just may not like it.",1416787200,22,863,4.484076433121019

2352769,3,B000A2X6OA,"At the start, the movie captivated me.  However, as it moved on, the realistic images and gross images became too much, and I lost interest.",1413849600,3,140,4.6
2352770,5,B000A2X6OA,"Alejandro Jodorowskys obvious tour de force, The Holy Mountain is a modern take on a classic tale. Monk shaves two nude womens heads, monk blesses women, man with beard is resurrected by a midget quadriplegic sitting in the beardmans urine, and the bearded man is tied to a cross while little mexican boys with green penises hurl rocks at him with joy. Man with a beard then forgives quadriplegicthey smoke marijuana together and fall in love. Man and little man with no arms or legs go into town for festival of columbus invading Mexico represented by frogs and turtles dressed up like little people, and participate in a mass execution of the locals by the police force while a policeman rapes a joyful woman while her husband takes pictures and laugh. Man wakes up in a room filled with jesus mannequins, freaks out, and goes about destroying all the jesuss and killing the men who made them. Classic story. Thats just the first 7 minutes. And then it gets really crazy.
Alejandro Jodorowskys was clearly heavily influenced by his experiences in Vietnam. I think most critics agree, 'The Holy Mountain' was what we all wanted David Lynches Eraserhead to be.",1411084800,43,1160,4.805
2352771,5,B000A2X6OA,"Very interesting movie, and if you're already a fan of Jodorowskys' work you'll definitely enjoy this one as well.",1409875200,,114,5.052631578947368

2352927,5,B000A2X6OA,A delightfully surreal social critique.  It is edgy now.  I find it shocking to think about someone seeing it in 1973.,1511308800,,118,4.571428571428571
2352928,5,B000A2X6OA,this movie is for the people who understand the symbolism.. its not anti god or evil as some comments say just have an open mind,1509753600,,128,4.16

2352930,5,B000A2X6OA,"A very significant landmark in cinema. Not pretty. Not quite a success in achieving what it meant to. In some ways a failure, but so significant, and so important as an artifact in cinema history . . . that you need to watch it and own it, if you are at all interested in film.",1508371200,,277,4.054545454545455
2352931,5,B000A2X6OA,"Quite possible the strangest film I've ever seen. Jodorowsky has a talent for leaving the viewer very confused, but at the same time, completely awe-struck.",1506556800,,156,5.28

2352999,5,B000A2X6OA,Wow. Amazing film. Probably should not have watched it at work though. Currently waiting for a call from HR. Totally worth it though.,1494460800,,133,4.826086956521739
2353000,5,B000A2X6OA,The first time i watched this film i was tripping on some very visual acid and it blew my mind. I have seen out since sober a few times and it is still enchanting and beautiful. Clearly a reflection of Jodorowky's spiritual so no definitive answers only great questions. It was my introducing to this Maestro's film work and made me wanna watch all his films. Definitely worth seeing though not my favorite of his films. But probably the most psychedelic.,1487980800,,455,4.62962962962963

2353002,2,B000A2X6OA,"I have not done enough drugs in my life which would have fried my brain to the point I could've enjoyed this film. Jodorowsky is unable to tell a cohesive story. Your friends and critics who speak highly of this film are trying too hard. It's a juvenile attempt at art and allegorical social commentary rife with projections of its creator's ego throughout. Distasteful and embarrassing.
That being said, I couldn't get this film out of my head for weeks; which is something no bright-garbage-rebooted-childhood-cartoon-rape a la Michael Bay could ever do. If this film is one thing, it's unforgettable, I'll give it that.
I'm giving it 1 star because it's not a film I'll ever need to see again. And also leopard titties.....",1485734400,,726,4.862903225806452
2353003,5,B000A2X6OA,I would recommend this film to anyone with an open mind that enjoys taking a break from Hollywood films to dive into the world of independent cinema of the 1970's.,1485734400,,163,4.466666666666667

2353006,1,B000A2X6OA,"La Montaa Sagrada (Holy Mountain, also reissued as The Sacred Mountain) is a psychedelic surrealistic film directed, written, produced, co-scored, co-edited by, costumed by, and starring Alejandro Jodorowsky.  While I will admit that many of the visuals and use of colour are stunning this is really just a wacked out film made by Alejandro Jodorowsky (a rich, drug using, supersticious, tarot card reading spiritualist) who was sadly funded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in making this film which contains scenes depicting CRUELTY TO ANIMALS in such scenes as the pit bull fight and the poor condition of the knees of the Bactrian camel.  If I had known this film contained ANIMAL ABUSE I would have never bought it.",1482710400,8,715,5.0
2353007,4,B000A2X6OA,"Wow, what a ride. This film showcases Jodorowsky's bizarre style and his high-energy, child-like creativity. The film is alternately fun and difficult to watch.",1482624000,,160,5.708333333333333
2353077,2,B000A2X6OA,"I could watched about 15 minutes before I realized it wasn't my cup of tea. I like symbolism, dark themes and absurdity in movies, but this movie did not seem to have a coherent plot at all and the amount of symbolism was overwhelming, impossible for me to digest or appreciate. I do believe that others could appreciate the movie if they have more of a liking for this kind of non plot driven genre.",1481155200,,400,4.346666666666667

2353080,1,B000A2X6OA,"A singular work of evil and irrationality.  An uninspired acid-induced rant, drawing impotent ""force"" from mocking Christianity at every turn.

But that's just my opinion (we live in a time celebrating philosophical relativism, so as long as I relegate the above to ""in my opinion"" no one is offended).

I want my 3.99 back.  I could have bought a used copy of Aristotle's poetics with that.

I sincerely hope this review will help someone save the money and avoid this disordered mess.",1477267200,5,486,4.878048780487805

It will break your mind, mix it like a scrambled egg, fry it on the sidewalk in Mexico next to a dead dog that was named ""The Thief"" when you were a boy. Upon waking you mistake yourself for Christ and start making out with your hermaphrodite mother who was living in a red tower with magic goats.
Yes, the movie is just like that.",1473465600,9,407,4.298701298701299

2353154,5,B000A2X6OA,"Love Jodorowsky, and love this movie! Had only read his books before. So I watched this insanely weird graphically psychedelic film and love it. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but Jodorowsky's brand of art is unique and he has the balls to do what he wants, which I really respect. He does not allow money or censorship to amend his vision.",1469491200,2,345,4.580645161290323

2353156,5,B000A2X6OA,"The greatest tragedy of the 20th century was that jodorowski did not get to create dune, and that instead the creative team he assembled to make it would define SF cinema with films like alien and blade runner.

But it was no accident that these teams were taken away from a religious visionary like jodorowski and handed to a hack advertising director like Ridley Scott. The resulting collective shrinking of the human imagination is what gives us - decades later - the kind of empty pseudo intellectualism of ""Prometheus"" - like a child overheard jodorowskis ideas and got them all wrong.

This film is a master work but it should have just been the beginning for western cinema. May it always serve as a high tide mark of cinematic art, until someone comes along to better it.",1469318400,,779,4.678832116788321
2353157,4,B000A2X6OA,"Good. Difficult to recomend. Surreal, but broadly so. I'll be following it up with further reading. My planet's satire struck me deeply. Excellent finish.",1468886400,,154,5.458333333333333
2353158,5,B000A2X6OA,"Amazing watch, dripping with symbolism and meaning, this is not your average art movie. The first time I've ever watched a movie all the way through, and promptly started it again from the beginning",1468886400,,198,4.852941176470588
2353159,5,B000A2X6OA,"I'm not sure I buy into Jodorowsky's metaphysical beliefs but he is a master at crafting surreal images that pull from a wide range of symbolic traditions, from the Tarot, to Christian Imagery,to Japanese Zen. Some might find it's lack of a clearly stated plot frustrating, but it operates on the consistently strange logic of it's visionary director. Having heard it was an intensely influential film for many other artists I decided to check it out and was not disappointed.",1468713600,3,476,4.9625
2353160,4,B000A2X6OA,"Wanted to see this film since I first saw some scenes. It is most certainly 70's surrealist stuff. But so engaging, and so filled with imagery. Won't lead anyone to enlightenment, but well worth a view or 3...(or more)...",1468281600,,221,4.6923076923076925
2353161,5,B000A2X6OA,This is a phenomenal movie that was made in the 70's and is worthy of inspection because jodorowsky has his own language. Great artists are often misunderstood or not understood until many years later after they die. There is much symbolism in this movie and it is underrated by most. Only those with certain knowledge will understand this movie. Yoga and certain topics are Good subjects to study before watching. But most will pass them by.,1466899200,,442,4.828947368421052

2353324,4,B000A2X6OA,"Jodorowsky certainly has an intriguing vision, at times throughout the movie one may wonder how many drugs were consumed during thr process of filming. I love the overall vision, yet at times its a bit too fetish-y-like for me and just kinda disgusting haha, there's a lot of stubby buisness and some humping of the mountain which I believe is supposed to be Holy, my attention faded when things got a bit too ridiculous but it is a classic cult film with oodles of symbology.",1456531200,,476,4.6117647058823525

I went in knowing that this movie would challenge my perceptions, but the effect that it had on my psyche was amazing. This movie will make you uncomfortable; it will make you rethink many preconceived notions that you hold dear.

He is definitely out there and you have to like to watch films with subtitles.  The films are philosophical and heavily allegorical.  They are well made and the quality of the film stock is  immaculate considering it was filmed in 1973.",1420934400,,528,4.673913043478261

8072994,1,B000A2X6OA,"Couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.

I shouldn't need to be on drugs to enjoy a movie.",1519862400,,90,4.0
8072995,1,B000A2X6OA,"Firstly, this film contains a sickening number of animals' corpses being used as props: skinned and gutted sheep hoisted on poles, a man reclining on the corpse of a bovine, the carcass of a pig used to carry cement, an tree filled with the corpses of chickens. Furthermore, there is actual on-screen animal abuse. They blow-up parts of the set with live toads on it like some deranged 12-year-old, and there is a possible real dog fight. Apparently, this director wasn't intelligent enough to get across the brilliant message that ""corporations, the government, and organized religion are bad, man"" without killing and abusing animals. This movie goes beyond ordinary pretentiousness, taking it to a callous level. I would not have paid t watch this movie if I had known that it contained animal abuse, and it should have a disclaimer.",1518912000,7,836,4.978571428571429
8072996,5,B000A2X6OA,"The film is primarily a biting criticism of the culture and visual language surrounding both art house and mainstream film. However it has a lot to say on a whole host of other topics, especially  the commodification of spirituality and art. The Holy Mountain remains both pertinent and conventionally hilarious even today.",1517875200,,323,5.211538461538462
8072997,4,B000A2X6OA,"Pure experiment. It's hard to quantify this film as anything close to traditional. It lacks anything like a standard three act structure, but largely makes up for it with its surreal and sometimes disturbing imagery. A must watch for fans of the works of Lynch and Refn, but maybe pass on it if you're looking for a light Saturday night romp.",1517788800,,342,4.622950819672131
