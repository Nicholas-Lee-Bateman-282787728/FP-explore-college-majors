8483048,5,B005QB9ZEU,"Opera singer Grace Moore performed on Broadway several years before becoming a popular opera singer.  She has a marvelous gift for comedy and makes lots of sparks matching Cary Grant's wonderful talent.  The cast is also awash in comic talent like Luis Alberni, Aline MacMahon, Thomas Mitchell.  The only opera we hear are Vissi D'arte during opening credits, and the last part of Un Bel Di from Madama Butterfly.  This ironically, played on an old wind up Victrola by Grant, not knowing she is the actual singer on the recording whom he used to idolize.  I am an opera fanatic, but the music I like best in this movie is Grace singing Minnie the Moocher with Grant at the piano.

I have all of Grace Moore's movies and I regard this and The King Steps Out as her best.",1324944000,5,769,4.496402877697841
