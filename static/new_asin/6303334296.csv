625300,5,6303334296,CONDITION WAS WHAT WAS SAID. GOT IT IN A FEW DAYS. I AM REAL HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE,1228262400,2,83,3.6666666666666665
625301,3,6303334296,For an European it's not always easy to know what the American schoollife is like. This movie shows some important sixties-things. My rate's 3 stars because the real age of the players makes some scenes lesser convincing.,1126828800,3,221,5.0
625302,5,6303334296,"I saw There Goes My Baby when it was in the theatres, and while I saw that there were some similarities between it and ""Hollywood Knights"" I don't think it was a blatant rip off... Floyd Mutrux wrote and directed both movies so there are bound to be some similar aspects. That's like hating Pulp Fiction because it had a similar feel to Reservoir Dogs.
I may be a bit biased because I love the ""one day in the life"" type of movies (ie Dazed and Confused) I thought it was a heartwarming and fun movie and it has a permanent place on my shelf next to the VCR.",1017619200,12,558,4.128440366972477
625303,1,6303334296,"Talk about lack of imagination. Sure a script, storyline could be influenced by others, but,""There goes my Baby"" was shameless in it's repeated rip-offs of entire chunks of story from the movie ""Hollywood Knights"".This might even be forgivable, but the use of complete lines of dialogue as well from the same flick really dissapointed me! There were notable acting moments, the fact that several of the actors went on and still are notables, makes it apparent that the weakness here was the lack of a real screenplay or solid storyline! I also expect authenticity, & the lack of any ""Musclecars"" mixed into the continuous parade of hot rods & custom (lead-sleds)  did not convey realism! You'd think that some of the hottest (& best selling) cars ever produced,I.E. GTO's,Chevelles, 442""s,409 Impalas would have been hitting the cruise spots profiled in this film??",1006646400,7,865,5.091549295774648
625362,4,6303334296,great memories from the 60's.,1407456000,,29,5.0
625363,5,6303334296,it was exaclty what i wanted.....,1404345600,,33,4.666666666666667
625364,3,6303334296,"It's a rainy day and I'm stuck watching what's on TV. All the while I'm watching this movie, I think it has a striking resembalance to one of my fav movies, The Hollywood Knights.

Knights was made in 1980, Baby in 1994.  Same director.  Same DJ in the record store, I recognized his voice.  Don't know his name.  Many of the story lines are very similar altho Hollywood Knights is about a car club in Beverly Hills and a teen hang-out called Tubby's Drive-in that's being torn down the following day.  One of the characters is going off to Vietnam the next day.  It's mostly a teen romp movie where Baby has significant social messages.  Hollywood Knights is way funnier. Also it has a young Michelle Phifer and Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl, Fran Dresher etc.  If you love Baby you'll love The Hollywood Knights.",1401321600,,808,4.555555555555555
625365,2,6303334296,A good storyline but really over acted or maybe over directed.  It's a shame because it had a promising cast.,1392163200,,109,4.45
625366,1,6303334296,Couldn't stay wake at all. If you need to get some sleep this is your video. but I would waste my time on this worthless video.,1391299200,,127,3.923076923076923
625367,1,6303334296,This tries to be a film that records events of historical significance.  I found the characters poorly developed and the plot slow moving.,1390435200,2,138,5.0
625368,2,6303334296,"and only a few of the actors can actually - you know - act.  (Some got better, some much better, as their careers unfolded. Others weren't so fortunate.)  Banal directing.",1390348800,,171,4.666666666666667
625369,1,6303334296,"Possibly the worst movie ever made. Even though it was free, it's an hour and half you'll never get back.  Rent Ameeican Graffitti instead.",1390003200,2,139,4.791666666666667
625370,5,6303334296,I like the old cars in this movie most of all. I thought the story was good too. Do a part 2 with the same case would be great.,1387497600,,127,3.413793103448276
625371,3,6303334296,"Worth it to see both Dermot Mulrooney and Rick Schroder go around topless.
and a soundtrack with some great music",1386892800,,113,4.7
625392,2,6303334296,Great music! Good cast. Bad execution. Terrible writing. Had a lot of promise and a lot of lofty preachy goals but never quite came through with a distinct voice or interesting message.,1386547200,,185,4.8125
625393,3,6303334296,Kind of a turning of age movie. It was entertaining but had bad language. Not something everyone would want to see,1377216000,,114,4.476190476190476
625394,1,6303334296,"Watching the behavior of teenagers in the 1960's isn't really my thing.  Although I'm old enough to remember the 60's, the behavior of these kids seems foreign to anything I recall",1375401600,2,180,4.806451612903226
625395,5,6303334296,"This movie is a true blast from the past. Wow...I sat glued to
my tv screen as I streamed it from Amazon.com. It definitely is
worth the watch. The acting is very good and the stars all share
the lead since there are several story lines going on at the same time.
I can't believe I had NEVER heard of this movie before my brother
told me about it recently. I loved it. I would buy it, but I can only find
it on VHS. Great Movie...",1374537600,,430,3.954022988505747
625396,4,6303334296,"Very entertaining. What it lacks in polish (possibly due to budget limitations) it makes up for in good intentions. The director certainly picked a winning cast, many of whom went on to much higher profile work.",1353715200,,211,4.888888888888889
625397,5,6303334296,"A well written story of coming of age and above average acting of the young boys and girls face life after high school. Almost everyone can relate to one of the characters and the frustration faced teenagers becoming adults. Sound track includes all the great music of the times, if you grew up in the fifties and sixties.",1352246400,,322,4.568965517241379
625398,5,6303334296,"I love this film, the plot, the characters and the music, everything is perfect, off course I'd prefer a happy ending for Pirate and Sunshine, but this film is magical anyway.",1348099200,,175,4.67741935483871
625399,3,6303334296,"When I saw the movie Platoon, I was really astonished. I could not believe that a film could actually capture what it was like for so many of us who were in the war there. But, the film was so authentic, that , at times, I felt like I was back there. Oliver Stone really did create a masterpiece. There Goes My Baby, in some ways, captures what it was like for high school students in the late 60's who were naive about the war, hurled into it by the policies of the government at the times, and did not know what they were getting into. So many of the stories in the film ring true for what it was like for me and my friends at that time ,and how, for so many of us, our lives changed courses drastically, because of the upcoming war. It was fun to see the actors in the film in some of their earliest acting. Actors that we recognize today after many films and roles.
I really enjoyed the music alot in the film. I was a big Motown fan and liked the Motown and rock music throughout the film ,and the stories of the hopes and dreams that the actors had about their lives and loves, and how so many of them changed as a result of events beyond their control. A interesting film, better than the typical teenage fodder of so many films.",1344556800,10,1236,4.1115702479338845
625400,2,6303334296,The acting is bad and the both the adults and kids in the film are stereotypes and two dimensional. The film aches to be American Graffiti but the plot developments are contrived and the result is just plain awful.  I gave it two stars because I like the music and it is fun to look at the period costumes and haircuts.,1331769600,,319,4.229508196721311
625401,2,6303334296,"Although there's a lot going on here, the wide sprawl of characters and situations not fully developed makes for a film that doesn't add up to much. The cast is very attractive but the script lets them down.  It's no wonder this film sat on the shelf for over two years before being released A real let down.",1329350400,,308,4.310344827586207
625462,4,6303334296,"This is worth watching.  I gave it 4 stars, but wasn't sure if 3 would have been better.  But there are good contrasts between affluent and non, white and black, ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" views, with several well-known male actors.  It reminds me of American Graffiti also, go figure.",1323388800,5,287,4.9375
625463,5,6303334296,"All I could remember about this movie was renting as a kid and loving it. It's the dazed and confused of the 60s where a group of graduates face the vietnam war, race wars, and dreams of the future that may not come true. Also Jill Schoelen is fabulous in this singing the shang rila's ""leader of the pack""",1317513600,,306,4.203389830508475
625464,5,6303334296,"From the hit song of the same name, this movie offers great performances of several young actors, growing up and deciding what path each will take upon graduation from high school.  This movie has a great plot and shows what a bunch of kids stand up to what they believe.  It's a fun movie with drama added as well.  Recommended!",1316563200,,329,4.45
625465,1,6303334296,"What can I say.  Blatant ripoff of AMERICAN GRAFITTI.  Last night of cruising & partying before leaving for college.  50's Music was  TOTALY ALL WRONG for a 1969 cruising setting....should have been more late 60's, anti war centric....this was my era so I know.

Acting was TERRIBLE!!  Must have been Dermot's, Noah's and Kelli's first acting job.  Mark Ruffalo had all of one line but he aced it in comparison.  Do NOT waste your $$$ as I did !
Too bad AMAZON does not allow "" NO STAR"" reviews.",1312761600,8,495,4.48314606741573
625466,5,6303334296,This is a terrific movie and I love movies set in the 60's. This is a tale about growing up and maybe going to war while other stay home and party. It reminds us that freedom isn't free and that someone has to fight for the freedom we enjoy!,1304294400,,241,3.938775510204082
625467,5,6303334296,"One of my all time favorites.  The characters were the same year in school as I was.  The music was great, but could have been more variety.  This was a spin off from ""American Graffiti"" I believe; a lot of similarities.  I love them both.  I like movies that take me back to my teen years.",1293753600,7,290,4.107142857142857
625468,5,6303334296,"I just happened to catch this movie, It took me back to my teenage years, growing up in NYC, Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen. Friday night dances at the CYO, beer, young love. Then it was NAM for me and a lot of my friends. Some of us didn't come back, some did. I was one of the Luck one's. I loved the music, and the memories...........",1287014400,2,332,4.123076923076923
625469,5,6303334296,"Fantastic movie. Shared it with my kids. Teaches a little 1960's history, tons of great 1930-1950 old cars, tons of great 50s and 60s music, brings backs lots of memories of old style hamburger joints, cruising, what it was like to be a kid in the 60s and 70s! Last days of High school, and so on. A true story to boot!",1272412800,8,319,4.161290322580645
625470,5,6303334296,"What a GREAT movie! I was taken back to an earlier time when we were the future of America. Acting is OK, music is even better. Worth the purchase for the wonderful music alone!  A 5 star adventure in my book!",1255996800,2,209,4.097560975609756

7843589,3,6303334296,"Of course, the visuals are most welcome and the cast is quite attractive The storyline and/or plot has much to be desired, but the essence of the era was caught in this film. I believe that ""torch song trilogy"" or ""a beautiful thing"" are much better stories. Cursing and bad behavior are something which has been in many of our more modern movies, but do not always add to the movie values. Young men usually do curse when not in the company of women so this is a realistic depiction of behavior which has been and continues to be typical and is neither liberal or conservative, but rather just a Proof that parents do not monitor their children's behavior or how they interact on different levels of society without trying to communicate using expanded vocabulary rather than what some consider strong language.  Screaming and cursing are clear signs the person does not believe they are being heard, but they do not have the capacity to communicate clearly and/or the recipient of said conversation is not responding to satisfy the speakers needs.  Overall I would rate this movie three stars Enjoy!",1422576000,,1101,4.7894736842105265
7843590,1,6303334296,"Horrible. Liberal, foul-mouthed, irreverent kids of the late 60s run around sleeping together, doing drugs, cursing their teachers and parents, and being all around jerks. Blacks are so righteous that they tell their grand kids to return the TVs that they looted from the riots. Just more liberal revisionism.",1417564800,3,309,5.326530612244898
