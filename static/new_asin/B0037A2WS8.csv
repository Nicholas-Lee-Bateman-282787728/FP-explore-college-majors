8390398,5,B0037A2WS8,"Since Mark Roth and ReelClassicDVD released this package nearly a couple of years ago now, it has become the label's best selling disc. Many who have reviewed it point to the side-by-side comparison disc as its best supplement, and while I'm very proud to have produced that extensive comparison for Mark's inclusion, for me, the best thing about this edition is the musical contribution by the late Lee Erwin, who had been performing organ on radio and television as far back as the 1930's.  He accompanied silent movies in theatre revivals beginning in the 1970's, for films from Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford, von Stroheim, Chaney, and many others, even accompanying Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' at Radio City Music Hall in 1975 - the first time a silent film ever played there.

Erwin composed scores for many silent films that would circulate in 16mm to private collectors, film libraries and television (back when local stations filled the late night and early morning airwaves with movies for insomniacs like me - a landscape now dominated by endless infomercials looking to part any fool with his money).  'Phantom' may be a film that is mercilessly recirculated on public domain videos and DVD from dupes of dupes of 16mm prints, and lifted (or more accurately, stolen) from one release to another, the ReelClassicDVD edition is unique in that it is the only version permitted to use Lee Erwin's copyrighted, original score. Television audiences often saw this version on late night television, many public libraries often had this version in their 16mm library (others may have had a Blackhawk version with Gaylord Carter's organ score - where the color Bal Masque footage first became available to the public, which itself became the source for further duplication), and it was the first version I saw as a youth in the early 1970's.

ReelClassicDVD's original single-disc 'Phantom' featured (along with its supplements) only the version with Bob Lee's copy of the color footage and Erwin's re-recorded score for this new section, although the color section was manipulated in such a way that it did not represent the color segment as originally issued, with time streched music.  Not only was I fortunate enough to convince Mark to issue the film as a 2-disc set, with separate color and original b&w versions in their original forms, but I convinced him to include a 3rd disc, featuring the comparison that I had worked on for several months as a labour of love, after noticing many differences between the two surviving versions - the 1925 show-at-home (which itself is cobbled together from many sources) and the more common version, a silent-only-of-sound reissue, which included some footage re-shot for the film's re-release in sound, but no actual surviving soundtrack, lost for many years but rediscovered, although the sound version itself is definitely a lost film.  I also provided my personal print of the 1925 show-at-home to allow him to make this a 4-disc special edition, with a newly recorded score by Ben Model.

16mm prints will never provide the image quality of the pristine 35mm print kept by the George Eastman House, used for The Blackhawk versions and Milestone DVDs, but for me, having the Lee Erwin scores available again after so many years is my primary motivation for enjoying this film.  I have 2 16mm prints of my own of Bob Lee's Essex Film Club Griggs-Moviedrome print (John Griggs provides the voice of the 'Lantern Man', and provided the original print source from which the movie was sold to collectors).  My contribution to this set may be singled out by others as its best supplement, but, once again, I have to be thankful that Mark Roth made this version, a long-sought after edition of this favorite of afficionados and collectors like me, available to the public again. What it lacks in image quality (due to the source material) it makes up significantly in a memorable music score.",1319155200,2,3931,4.9984709480122325
8390399,2,B0037A2WS8,"Frankly, I found this product a disappointment. Despite the claims on Amazon regarding this DVD set, you won't find much about 'Phantom' that isn't already on the 'Milestone Collection' box set, which is the definitive set for anyone fascinated by this film. I bought this mainly for the side to side comparison with the 1925 and 1930 versions, and to hear the voice of the 'man with the lantern'. The comparison, I admit, was interesting and clever, but I couldn't find any details about the voice of the 'lantern' man - is this an original recording, or just added recently for this set, and who is John Griggs anyway? There are no sleeve notes whatsoever! Included are two presentations of what I conclude is the 1930 version, one with and one without the colour sequences. In any case both were washed out and as far as I could see not from a 35mm scource. The 1925 version was just awful with dark, hardly discernable images. The 'Milestone' copy of this version is much clearer.
Always interested to learn more about this subject I think I payed through the nose, as this set was rather expensive!",1300320000,4,1103,4.661538461538462
