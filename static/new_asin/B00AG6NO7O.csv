5424158,5,B00AG6NO7O,"Female On The Beach was released in 1955. One of my favorite Joan Crawford films. She plays it way over the top and I love it ! Some of her dialogue will make you scream with laughter. Cast is wonderful with Jeff Chandler, Natalie Schaefer, and Jan Sterling providing able support.  Very hot and heavy with melodrama but don't worry about danger,it's Joan's film all the way. So happy it is finally on DVD. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1361491200,4,448,4.397590361445783

5424163,4,B00AG6NO7O,"Female on the Beach is a great film if you are a Joan Crawford fan which I am.  This is Joan's film from beginning to end but a few of the supporting cast get some good lines as well.  I didn't think this film would ever get released on dvd and it finally did in a boxed set entitled ""Women in Danger"" but Amazon released it as a single title--you can't find the single title at TCM or Movies Unlimited---so, thank you Amazon.  The supporting cast is great----especially Jan Sterling, Cecil Kellaway, and Natalie Schaefer, and, of course, Marjorie Bennet(who appears in small roles in 2 other Crawford films) also has a small part as a maid in this film.  Jeff Chandler is good in his leading role opposite Crawford but I think looks a little old to be playing a sort of gigolo part.  I think either Joan or Universal wanted Tony Curtis for this part but he was either unavailable or just didn't want to do it but Jeff Chandler is satisfying in the role.  The plot is very suspenseful and full of all kinds of twists and turns and will keep you interested.  The only thing I don't like is the hokey theme music played during the opening credits---it makes me laugh every time I hear it!  Just a trivia note:  it is interesting when Jeff Chandler is explaining to Joan Crawford how he met Queenie & Osgood(Natalie Schaefer & Cecil Kellaway)----he tells Joan that he was giving them a tour of the islands(Natalie Schaefer played Mrs. Howe on Gilligan's Island where they were shipwrecked during a 3-hour tour---a 3 hour tour---lol).",1357776000,4,1530,4.534545454545454
5424164,5,B00AG6NO7O,"Many Joan Crawford fans, myself included, have literally waited decades for this film to come out on home video/DVD. Originally release as Universal's ""Woman in Danger Series"" in mid 2012, ""Female on the Beach"" is now available as a stand-alone film and it is worth every penny. Remastered from the studio master tape ""Female on the Beach"" was for many years a favorite of late-night viewers on the ""Late, Late Show"" on many TV stations and became a favorite on American Movie Classics.

 Hitting theatres in 1955 ""Female"" deals with a lonely widow, Lynn Markham, who goes to her deceased husband's beach house, probably Malibu, and soon falls for a hunky gigalo played to perfection by Jeff Chandler (Crawford was dating him at the time). Filled with great lines, a beautiful wardrobe worn by Joan and a great supporting cast Joan stated years later, ""It really wasn't a bad film, but the thing that hurt it was what hurts so many melodramas...the lack of credblity"".

 In the story Joan can't figure out if her new love is a murderer or not, but her desire to be with this young stud overshadows everything else. The chemistry between Crawford and Chandler is evident and ""Female on the Beach"" has become one of my favorite films in Joan's catalogue.

 The film is in full-screen ratio and looks flawless.",1357430400,26,1307,4.786666666666667

5424178,4,B00AG6NO7O,"Joan was still going strong and giving her career her all in the 1950s, at a time when most of her contemporaries had faded from the scene.  (You have to remember that she started out in silent pictures; very few other stars from that era were still working by 1955.)  And she's so much fun to watch in this film!  Very arch and sarcastic, she tosses off a number of cutting one liners to great effect.  Ah yes, and of course she gets a couple of good slaps in too (as she said herself, ""I do that in all my pictures!"").

Man, I do enjoy this film; it's one of my favourites out of the thirteen theatrical features Crawford filmed during the fifties.  Now, it's rather seedy and trashy to be sure.  After all, just look at the set-up; you have a mature couple ""sponsoring"" a younger ""stud-muffin"" (for lack of a better term--ha!) whose sole purpose in life is to serve as an escort (in and out of the bedroom) for older rich women, in order to fleece them out of a bit of money.  A slightly daring thing to put on film, but by the mid-fifties the screenwriters could get away with a lot more than they could even a few years earlier; even then the production code was starting to crumble.

Beefy Jeff Chandler, as the gigolo in question, is ridiculously attractive and readily puts his assets on display throughout the film.  I wonder---was it a bit unusual to so unabashedly and overtly portray a man as an obvious sex object at that time?  Not that the audience is complaining!  (Some would say it's a pity that he was forced to shave and wax for the role (which he complained about)---heck, even back in the fifties fellows were manscaping and getting rid of the furry chests.)

The plot and dialog have little to do with reality---one reviewer said ""Make no mistake: Female on the Beach is a strange movie about strange characters doing strange things on the beach.""  But as I noted above---it's so much fun.  Campy to be sure, but it's also a decent domestic thriller and an enjoyable fifties soap; yep, it's full of soapy goodness.

Technical note:  oddly enough, my DVD is presented at the standard Academy aspect ratio of 1.37:1, even though it was intended to be projected at a ratio of 2:1.  (2:1 is a widescreen ratio that was used for a few films in the mid-fifties, but which never caught on as one of the standards for widescreen pictures---1.85:1 and 2.39:1 became the norm instead.)  So, what this means is that we see a lot of extra picture at the top and bottom of the frame on this DVD; there's a heck of a lot of extra headroom--- a larger portion of the great mid-century modern interiors are on display than was originally intended by the cinematographer.  As a result, I found that using the zoom feature on your widescreen television to fill the frame (televisions have a aspect ration of 1.78:1) actually improves the look of the film; the compositions look very good when zoomed in.",1434153600,,2908,4.492395437262357
5424179,5,B00AG6NO7O,"What a great and entertaining film by Joan Crawford. The plot is somewhat far-fetched, but the acting more than makes up for it. Joan plays the lonely and rich widower who meets beach bum/gigolo Jeff Chandler and the stage is set for sinister and melodramatic happenings. Natalie Shafer and her husband Cecil Kelloway play pimps in this movie! Not one boring moment .",1433116800,,367,4.841269841269841
5424180,5,B00AG6NO7O,"I love this movie. You know the phrase ""when it's bad it's better""! Crawford's acting is so over the top - hysterical!  ""I have a long list of dislikes and it's getting longer"" - I have adopted that line for my own :)",1426982400,,217,4.046511627906977

5424187,5,B00AG6NO7O,"THIS MOVIE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! And I have seen over 5,000 films in my 62 years. If I have to go to a deserted island with a solar-powered avi-or-mp4 player with only one movie on it, it would have to be Female on the Beach! The film's situation is so unbelievable, and its dialogue is so unintentionally funny and memorably quotable that it merits repeated viewings. The casting, location, costume, and music are first rate! Supposedly at the time when this film was in pre-production, Joan Crawford was ""friendly"" with the head of Universal Pictures which is how Jeff Chandler got the lead in this movie even though he was 13 years younger than her. When this movie was made in 1955, Joan was 50 and Jeff 37! His prematurely gray hair sometimes cast him in older roles.

Watch out for the tiny dog in Natalie Schafer's purse when she and Cecil are plotting on the beach talking about Drummy (Jeff). Near the end of the movie when Natalie shows off her new extra-dumb boytoy Ed Fury to Joan and Jeff commanding him to say ""Hello"" (which is probably all he can do!), tears practically run down my face with extreme enjoyment.

It helps if the viewer has a warped sense of humor and appreciates older cinema. Worth the money and time if that floats your boat. A camp classic for the ages!!! Enjoy!",1420329600,17,1311,4.504201680672269
5424188,4,B00AG6NO7O,"One of the great Crawford ""cult"" classics. Those huge eyes, that slash of red lips, who can resist? The dialogue is campy and bitchy. She romps around in outrageous 50's costumes and she's so ""soft focused"" she seems to be in a fog. But it's her show all the way. Who can blame her for falling in love with the handsome gigolo next door? Even by today's standards Jeff Chandler is pretty hot stuff. Highly recommended for all Crawford fans and anyone who likes campy ""over the hill"" film queen nonsense.",1420070400,3,503,4.538461538461538

5424194,5,B00AG6NO7O,"A must have for any Joan Crawford aficionado. Most of the movies Joan made in the 50s are considered to be camp classic. Largely because of Joan's acting approach (nobody bothered to tell her they were B movies) she's always so over the top with the long drawn out gazes off into space - LOL. Nonetheless, these movies, Female on the Beach included, are guilty pleasures and thoroughly enjoyable. Thrilled to see them making their way to home video!",1411171200,,449,4.69620253164557
5424195,5,B00AG6NO7O,"Great mid-50's Joan Crawford in danger flick.  She plays a rich widow taking possession of her rental property where another rich widow just took a swan dive from the balcony onto a pile of rocks.  Right away the gigolo next door tries to make the moves on her.  After a cold start to their relationship she falls for lover boy.  Eventually she starts to have doubts, is he really in love with her or is he trying to do away with her for her money.  Only in a Crawford film would a clearly mid-to-late forties woman (and looks every year of it) be expected to be believed as a late twenties-to-early thirties ""young girl"".  AND, everyone refers to her as a beautiful woman.  She certainly is attractive, but I guess it was in her contract to be considered a virtual goddess.  Who else dresses to the teeth in evening gowns and top-of-the-line jewelry to have dinner ALONE at home.  Only our Joan.  Still very entertaining.  The house (which is very nice) is supposed to be a beachfront property but the area looks (to me) like a lakefront.  The whiny, slightly jazzy music is great.  One of my favorite Crawford films.

Natalie Shafer (Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island) and her husband are pimps (yes, PIMPS) push Chandler into the arms of older (50ish) women, and, after he's totally sexed them up, The pimps move to bilk the women of their dough. Crawford is nobody's fool and sees right through his initial passes, but finally falls head over ass in love. The dialogue? One critic said ""Somebody pass the cheez whiz"" Crawford is a steamroller here, except for a few brief scenes where she underplays beautifully, showing us glimpses of the wisdom that comes only from living life fully and getting pushed and hurt once in a while.

The film is unexpectedly well-done. The male lead, Jeff Chandler, is sexy, strong and a good match for Joan, who displays a vulnerability that is impressive in this role of a lonely widow who needs love even though she doesn't realize it. The dialogue is fresh and surprisingly risque. I felt that the movie was utterly modern in some ways while listening to the dialogue. This film has definitely stood the test of time.

With respect to its standing as a mystery, it's got everything; a small (but not too small) cast, plenty of red herrings, a tightly plotted action, and a handful of sets. It's entertaining and just complicated enough without being overwheming. They hit one out of the park with this thriller.",1391990400,2,897,4.743589743589744

Jeff Chandler is no shakes as a serious actor, but could have come off much worse co starring with Joan Crawford. I think that her restrained performance helped him thoughout the film. She has some witty lines, but doesn't try to take over the whole show.  THE PLOT...Sexually frustrated after loosing her husband, she turns up to close the house she has been renting, not knowing the last tenant has either been murdered or having committed suicide. Deciding to stay in the house after seeing hunky Jeff Chandler, the beach bum ( and who wouldn' t) she struggles with the thought did he or did he not have anything to do with the demise of the previous lady.
Buy the dvd and see...This is excellent viewing, and future re -viewing....
Just one little nit pick, a couple of very flouncie 1950 dress designs she wears, is a little too young for her, yes, ok for Sandra Dee, but for a mature Crawford, h'mm, though, she nearly gets away with it, others woudn't.

And so begins this mid-fifties ""melodrama"" with Jeff Chandler, Natalie Schaefer, Cecil Kellaway and a few never-rans.  It's not a bad film, but it's a stupid one.  The dialogue, in my opinion, is far more campy than ""Torch Song"" or ""Johnny Guitar"".  It's really just Crawford as another lonely, horny woman who first fights her desire for ""Drummy"" (Chandler) and then lets it all hang out for him.  But is he a murderer?

While I don't begrudge anyone for giving five star ratings to Grade B films, I find it unfair to unsuspecting customers who don't know better to ascertain from these same five star reviews that this is a ""great"" film.  It isn't.  For Crawford fans ONLY!!!!!",1367712000,4,813,4.583333333333333

Apart from a few select movies in the 50s and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" with Bette Davis in 1962, her career had lost it's punch.  As it is with many aging actresses, producers and directors have trouble finding roles suitable for them.  ""Female on the Beach"" was one of them.  ""The Queen Bee"", ""Harriet Craig"" and perhaps ""Autumn Leaves"" rekindle the Crawford of the 40s to a degree.  I was not familiar with ""Female on the Beach"", but was willing to give it a chance.  While not a terrible movie, I don't think it gave Crawford much to ""sink her teeth into"" for a great role.

I've been waiting for years to see this film, and it wasn't a disappointment.  Revamped 1950s Joan Crawford at her best, with the handsome and charming Jeffrey Chandler. Greater plot, cast, etc.",1495152000,,461,4.542168674698795

Crawford steals every scene as expected.
Try 'Sudden Fear' next.",1492128000,,80,5.230769230769231
8551255,5,B00AG6NO7O,"Okay, this is a FIVE Star review for its unintended hilarity.  The movie is a riot, with Joan at her most scene-chewing, miscast best.  Surrounded by great character actors of the day, and in spite of a good-looking but wooden actor (Chandler) as her co-star, Joan still steals the show.  Literally, you can't take your eyes off her, while she saunters on a beach in a cocktail dress and high heels, makes outrageous nasty wisecracks to, and about everyone (did she ad-lib?) and wrings as much angst and guts as she can manage from this b-pulp script.  BRAVA!!!!",1490918400,2,562,4.704081632653061

8551257,3,B00AG6NO7O,"This film is slightly trashy but fun to watch.

 Joan gives her usual intense performance. Perhaps it would've been better if the beach comber/ hustler was younger and more attractive, like the one who came to replace him at the end of the picture.

One of Joan's campiest pictures.",1483056000,,282,4.714285714285714

I searched for this movie, and a few others, on DVD for several years but thought it would never get released, so I forgot about it for a while.  I was surprised to find it brand new here and bought it right away.",1483056000,,440,3.802197802197802
