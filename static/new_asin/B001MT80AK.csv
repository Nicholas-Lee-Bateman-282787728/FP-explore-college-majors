8321735,2,B001MT80AK,"The scenery was nice, and no doubt, there's some knowledge here, but overall, I was disappointed.  My predominant thought was that this was a nice little home movie, and that any sales proceeds would likely help to fund this couple's next adventure - thanks, but I'd rather spend the money to pay for my own.",1323302400,,308,4.6
8321736,5,B001MT80AK,"Very entertainment and educative. A movie that is fun and pleasant to watch. I will recommend this to anybody, not just wine enthusiast people.",1281830400,3,143,5.0
8321737,1,B001MT80AK,"What a disappointment. This DVD is little more than a sight seeing tour of France. Nice towns and inn's but not much more. Oh sure they stop and drink a little wine every night but not much more. If you were expecting to see your favorite Chateau or vineyard, forget it. There is nothing to do with actual wine making other than a small section on Bordeaux. Big waste of $27.00....",1234051200,,381,4.380281690140845
8321738,1,B001MT80AK,"this dvd has more to do with castles and tourist attractions than wine.  i am studying wine, and they listed few grapes, few names, few places.  i have learned more about french wine and grapes, and areas, and harvesting, climate, etc. from wine for dummies (the basic wine for dummies) than anything i saw in the 15 minutes i watched this dvd.  if u are interested in seeing castles and learning about what kind of birds inhabit the wine growing areas of france, then this dvd is for u.  if u are a serious student of wine, don't waste your time.",1212364800,3,547,4.3861386138613865
8321739,4,B001MT80AK,"I was looking for a full descriptif of each French region as well as good info on wine , that DVD did the job perfectly .
Good quality image and adequate comments.",1207353600,,163,4.125
