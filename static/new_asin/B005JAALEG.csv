8475554,5,B005JAALEG,"Purchased this for a friend who fell in love when we originally watched it.  Shows the resiliency of the Japanese people, from the level of everyday people. My favorite character is Chogawa.  He is a writer and artist of Manga.  His talents are not great and he keeps hoping for that magic breakthrough.  He reluctantly agrees to provide a home for Junnosuke, an unwanted boy being cared for by a woman that Chogawa has a crush on.  The young boy has a talent for drawing and writing Manga.  This leads to a big fight with Chogawa.  There are other characters and events that take place on 3rd Street, that are also very enjoyable to watch and become drawn into their highs and lows also.  A fantasitc insight into Japanese culture from a movie that won Japan's version of the Academy Awards.",1424131200,,792,4.567375886524823

I went from cautiously liking this film in the first 40 minutes to despising it in the last hour or so. The schmaltzy sentimentality accumulates and creeps up on you, until towards the end you feel overdosed on insincerity to the point of nausea. The emotion portrayed is utterly hollow and manipulative in its dishonesty. By apparently trying to copy/compete with Hollywood at its most disingenuous, this film surpasses the worst of Hollywood hypocrisy.

There is plenty of style in the technical aspects of the film-making, but for all the ""realistic"" computer graphics recreating the city of Tokyo in 1958, no amount of vacuous slickness can give any honesty, reality or authenticity to the people and situations. The empty ""rebirth symbolism"" of the construction of the tower is an appropriate reflection of the empty film itself; is the film's soullessness symptomatic of the soullessness of the country's ""rebirth"" since the destruction of seven decades ago?",1384128000,,991,5.1875
8475556,5,B005JAALEG,"The Movie is a beloved classic in our family but it would not play in the zone
for Japan.  We have watched the movie in Japan.
But we could not use this dvd, even though it was recorded for use in Japan.
We were given a refund without any trouble. If you can get a good DVD you will love it, makes you laugh and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.  Good for all ages, and Always II has come out.  It gives you an idea of what Japan looked like a few years back.",1361059200,,457,3.789473684210526
8475557,5,B005JAALEG,"I like this movie very much, especially in a time where there are so much political instability and chaos everywhere, and the global economy is completely out of control. Though the actings were uneven, the deep and profound sincerity of this film made up for all the imperfections. The pace of the movie was also good, 2:11 went by quickly. And I can't wait for the sequel to come out on DVD because I want to find out what happened to all the endearing characters shortly after 1958.",1326067200,3,485,4.5227272727272725
