1079278,3,6305772746,"While a notable success in its day, this 15-chapter serial about an expedition to darkest Africa now looks dated and remote -- more closely resembling the silent movies which preceded it than the classic war-time serials which followed it.
The plot involves one of those ""mad scientists"" who, from his hide-out inside an African mountain, sends out electrical disturbances which threaten to destroy civilization. A party is dispatched from America to find and destroy the source of these disturbances. There's plenty of opportunity for action and exotic locales but the action rarely rises above the routine and the locales look more Californian than African. What's more, an excess of characters tends to clutter up the proceedings.
William Boyd, (not the Hopalong Cassidy actor), plays the mad scientist in the usual villainous style and Claudia Dell is the swooning and rather irritating heroine. George ""Gabby"" Hayes delivers the best of the supporting performances. Serial-king Kane Richmond makes an appealing hero and he's iconographically dressed throughout in boots, jodhpurs, and torn shirt, but his work here is a notch below his later appearances in ""Spy Smasher"" and ""Haunted Harbor,"" and his potential for ""beefcake bondage"" largely goes untapped.",971395200,5,1261,5.438775510204081

.

Distributed by Super-Serial Productions of NYC, THE LOST CITY is truly one of the worst examples of the cliffhanger genre: 12 chapters and four hours of slow agony in which the stench of amateur acting is exceeded only by constant racial stereotypes of the most offensive sort.

Every episode of this tedious story is over-populated with a variety of primitive Africans who screech, caterwaul and jump around spastically at every possible opportunity. A matched pair of oil-skinned Nubian giants guard the evil mad scientist, Dr. Zolok. One, who gets screen credit for playing ""Hugo,"" frequently crosses his eyes while making otherworldly guttural noises.

Political incorrectness doesn't end with grass-skirted tribsemen. For an hour midway through, Gino Corrado dons clean bedsheets for his role of Sheikh Ben Ali.

The most familiar cast member is 'Gabby' Hayes, wearing a 10 o'clock shadow and portraying a bad guy who turns good in Chapter 11 (there's hope for all villians, apparently!). Of especial interest to antique animation fans is little Billy Bletcher, the gravelly voiced Big Bad Wolf in Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THREE-LITTLE-PIGS/dp/B001PK47GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THREE LITTLE PIGS</a>&nbsp;(1933) and various evil characters in early Looney Tunes shorts. Here, Bletcher is Zolok's reluctant slave and later, an ally of the Good Guys.

Female lead Claudia Dell was a Ziegfeld showgirl who appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALGIERS/dp/B0002CR4GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALGIERS</a>&nbsp;(1938), the famous Charles Boyer ""Casbahhhhhh"" melodrama. As an actress, she's beyond wooden. More interesting is Margot D'Use, who's seen in four late episodes as Rama, Queen of the Wangas. A young lady of exceptional beauty, she brings Latin flavor to this odd sci-fi adventure stew. Miss D'Use only appeared in one other film, which is our loss.

Kane Richmond is our hero. That gaping look of terror he wears as a deadly light beam tears through a table top and comes straight for him is right out of a game of Charades. Josef Swickard is Dr. Manyus, Miss Dell's daddy. He has a fabulous mane of white hair and sense enough to let others do most of the overacting.

The story? What can I say. IT'S DUMB. Even though I toughed it out to the very end, it wasn't out of curiosity or admiration. I just cannot in good faith recommend this silly thing.",1318204800,,2598,5.595419847328245
7895468,5,6305772746,"What surprises me most about The Lost City is how much I enjoyed it.  This is the first serial I've watched since I was a kid - around 1987 I picked up Volume 1 of the first Buster Crabbe ""Flash Gordon"" serial and watched it countless times.  I knew it was old, I knew it was clunky, but something about it went straight to my juvenile cortex.  And that's predominately who serials were created for - kids.  So to enjoy these things you have to put yourself somewhat on that level; you have to enjoy the thrills for what they are, you have to take the shoddy production values for what they are.  You have to turn off your adult mind.  (There is of course another way to enjoy these serials - call over some friends, crack open some beer, and let the comments rip.)

Despite all these caveats, The Lost City actually succeeds as pure entertainment.  Produced and released in 1935, it's comprised of twelve cracking ""chapters"" which run the gamut from flat-out action to Machiavellian intrigue, with enough sexual tension to keep even the ladies interested.  (Okay, maybe that last one's stretching it a bit.)

The story: the world's going to pieces, with tornadoes and hurricanes and earthquakes ripping apart civilization.  Electrical engineer Bruce Gordon (played by the square-jawed Kane Richmond) determines that the source of these problems is in an uncharted region of Africa.  Putting together a group composed of his comedic-relief pal Jerry (Eddie Fetherston) and a few professors and soldiers, Bruce heads for Africa.  There he discovers The Lost City (called such even by its inhabitants), a high-tech fortress built within The Magnetic Mountain.  Here evil Zolok (William ""Stage"" Boyd  in a drunken scenery-chewing performance for the ages) helms his ""Bride of Frankenstein""-esque electrical equipment - equipment which has been wreaking all of that aforementioned havoc.

Also in the Lost City is Dr. Manyus, Zolok's chief scientist, and Manyus's pretty and vivacious daughter, Natcha (Claudia Dell, apparently the original model for the Columbia Pictures logo, and a lady with one shrill scream).  Natcha's of course the damsel in distress; she's a headwrap-loving girl who, it seems, has never seen a white man (and yes, she makes this distinction), other than Appollyn (Jerry Frank), a hulking stooge who serves as Zolok's henchman and who runs about in a pair of lightning bolt-emblazoned tights.  There's also a hunchback named ""Gorzo"" afoot.  Oh yes, we are in pure pulp territory here.

After lots of action in The Lost City, with Natcha instantly swooning over Bruce, the story ""opens up"" with lots more action in the jungle itself; indeed, chapters five through ten don't have much to do with the story proper.  Bruce has, after all, come here to stop the electrical shenanigans which have caused the weather disasters back home, but all this is forgotten for half of the serial, with the story instead revolving around a lot of jungle adventure and plotting amongst various characters to get possession of the ""zombie giants"" created by Zolok and Dr. Manyus.

Zombie giants?  Yes; in some of the most bizarre footage I've ever witnessed, Zolok and Dr. Manyus take shrieking African natives, strap them to an electrocution-style slab of metal, and enlarge them into monstrous giants.  The actors portraying these giants are truly impressive; Sam Baker, who plays the ""lead"" zombie, Hugo (!), has to be at least seven feet tall, and he's built like a Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker.  He and his fellow zombies tower over the other actors, and it's to the producer's credit that Bruce and his comrades are unable to match strength with them.

Zolok has created these giants - incredibly strong but brain-dead - and various personages who happen to be around the Lost City want them for their own purposes.  First there's Sheikh Ben Ali (played by Gino Corrado - and let me just say, you haven't lived until you've seen a fake Arabian singing a fake Arabic song), who wants to amass his power with said giants; next there's duplicitous Butterfield (played by Gabby Hayes!), an American adventurer who has no qualms with back-stabbing; and most importantly there's the jaw-dropping Queen Rama, a slave-trader who commands a legion of natives and serving-girls (played by the gorgeous Margot D'Use, who seems to have done little else).

All of these intrigues and double-crosses wind upon themselves to such an extent that I - an adult viewing this serial seventy-four years after it was produced - had a hard time following it all.  But man I enjoyed it.  There are all these little touches that still have me smiling: the goofy yet endearing way that  Natcha grabs hold of Bruce in every single scene they're in together, from clutching his hand to full-on wrapping herself around him; Queen Rama's imperious gestures, which are just pitch perfect; the malevolent-looking devices Zolok has at his disposal, all of which spit out strands of electrify (designed by Ken Strickfaden, who designed the similar special effects for ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein""); the impromptu and irrelevant costume-changes for both Natcha and Queen Rama (the former donning a black pantsuit - complete with headwrap, of course - and the latter donning an outrageous full-body bikini made of a leopard's pelt); how William ""Stage"" Boyd stumbles through his lines (yet still delivering them with appropriate menace and tyranny), even tripping down a small stairway; the corny dialog Jerry delivers with aplomb (at one point both he and Bruce are trussed up, and while they're struggling to break free of their bonds Jerry observes, ""So this is Africa?"").

Okay, I've gone this far without mentioning the racist element of The Lost City.  It's there, and there's no apologizing for it.  Part of me wants to argue that maybe it's there for a reason, the producers parodying the ""black fear"" of whites, these super-large zombie giants acting as ludicrous extremes of ""native savagery.""  In other words, like the serial equivalent of those frenzied last pages of Thomas Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" where Pynchon goes into this essay about racism and the bizarre fears many whites have of blacks.  But I can't make that argument, because it would be moot.  The Lost City is a racist film, pure and simple, and I would not advise anyone who is sensitive to issues of race to watch it.  For this is a serial in which a character will say ""That's a WHITE girl's scream!"" before even seeing the screaming girl, a serial where African natives beg to be ""turned white"" by Dr. Manyus and then jump for joy when they are turned so, a serial where the Africans are treated like wallpaper, less than wallpaper, there just to carry around victims or to bark out bizarre grunts as they attack the white heroes.

It's my understanding that this element of The Lost City was considered outdated by viewers even in 1935 (but that didn't stop it from being a hit).  I'll make this clear: I am a white male, and though this element of the serial upset me, it didn't infuriate me.  I'm unsure how viewers of other racial backgrounds would view it.  Sam Baker (Hugo) himself later apologized to the black community for being in the serial; in one of those heartwarming stories that Hollywood surprisingly hasn't lapped up, Baker became lifelong friends with Jerry Frank (Appollyn), and the two met Martin Luther King, Jr a few decades later.  Both apologized to King for having appeared in The Lost City, but MLK told them they had nothing to apologize for.

And he had a point.  For despite all of its racist nonsense, The Lost City IS an enjoyable movie, and with a simple brain-change one can overlook the racism, chalk it up as a sign of a forgotten time and move on.  Because,  just to reiterate, I've never seen anything like this serial.  It's more of a comic-book-on-film than ANYTHING Hollywood has released in the past decade, and I plan to watch it again and again.

Please note: there are two DVD releases of The Lost City currently available: there's ""Lost City,"" released in 2005 by Alpha Video, and there's ""The Lost City,"" released in 2006 by VCI Entertainment.  The one you want is the one released by VCI Entertainment.  Avoid the Alpha Video release.  Sure, the Alpha Video DVD is about ten dollars less expensive than the VCI, but you're getting what you pay for; the print used for the Alpha Video DVD is noisy, filled with blemishes, and worst of all cuts off a lot of the print (ie scenes where the actors' heads are missing from the frame).  The VCI print is worlds better, but that's to be expected from them; VCI actually takes the time to restore these serials, and they release them in the best format possible.  So by all means, get your Lost City fix from VCI.",1245024000,15,8778,4.875420875420875
7895469,1,6305772746,"""The Lost City"" (1935) is a 12-chapter bungle in the jungle. Despite the electrical effects of Kenneth Strickfaden, amateurish acting and inept direction create many unintentional laughs. William ""Stage"" Boyd (who plays the evil ruler Zolok) was reportedly drunk throughout the production and really lets it rip during the final chapter. Ironically, Zolok turned out to be the scandal-ridden actor's most famous role. A guilty pleasure for many serial buffs.",1238976000,,458,5.557142857142857
7895470,5,6305772746,"First, take a look at the technical crew on this baby: cinematography by Edward Linden, who was the cinematographer on 1933's ""King Kong"", art direction by Ralph Berger, who went on to do ""Flash Gordon"" a couple of years later, and special electrical effects by Ken Strickfaden, who did both the original ""Frankenstein"" AND ""Bride of Frankenstein"". This is GREAT stuff! Good-guy lead Kane Richmond went on to become 1942's ""Spy Smasher"", and played Lamont Cranston (""The Shadow"") in THREE flicks. But the guy who really sets the tone of this frantic actioner is William ""Stage"" Boyd. (He started using ""Stage"" as a differentiator from the ""other"" William Boyd, better known to all as ""Hopalong Cassidy"".) Boyd is obviously intoxicated through most of this, but was rip-roaring drunk during the filming of the final episode, establishing himself as perhaps the maddest scientist of all time. He can hurl thunderbolts across the planet, sink ships, cause earthquakes, turn normal men into giants and black men into white. His strong-man assistant Appollyn (Jerry Frank) struts around in an outfit that looks like Aquaman's scaled undershorts with suspenders. He never ""made it"" - a look at the Internet Movie Database shows him playing assorted thugs and ""sharkmen"" in everything from ""Flash Gordon"" to 1957's ""Bop Girl Goes Calypso"" (remind me to check THAT out sometime!) The acting is more over-the-top than an Italian opera - it approaches the stratospheric heights of ""Fiend of Dope Island"", and that's the, ummmm, highest (sorry) accolade I can possibly give. Never a dull moment, endlessly entertaining, and sets the standard for serials for at least the next decade. The VCI print is well cleaned-up, but the sound does get a bit murky in spots (unfortunately, one being the very first run of the opening credits - DON'T let that put you off!) My absolute top recommendation! ""Put him in the Brain Destroyer!!""",1207785600,7,1916,5.085714285714285

7895473,5,6305772746,"This is one of my favourite serials, ever.  Set in Africa, it contains a great deal of potentially offensive racism, as hapless Blacks are captured by a mad scientist and turned into zombie giants.  The appearance of the movie is so dated that even these potentially offensive stereotypes don't offend.  For me, they add to the hilarious effect of this melodrama.  Those who are straightlacedly correct will not find this entertaining: but these people aren't probably interested in the kind of comedy this film offers.
It also contains some of the finest loopy ""scientific"" explanations I have ever seen.  In his mad quest for More Power! mad scientist Zolok sets off electrical disturbances that cause severe storms across the globe.  For what end, we aren't really told.  Despite the dire weather, our hero manages to travel from America to Africa to confront the madman.
The performance by William ""Stage"" Boyd as Zolok is another comedy highlight, and gets funnier as the series progresses; the finale is great.  Kane Richmond is pretty good as the hero.  Gabby Hayes has a part as a slave trader.  The generic love interest and her captive father are rather dull, although she gets off a line complaining of Zolok's cru-el deeds that never fails to bring a chuckle.
Obviously this is not -Citizen Kane-.  But if if you're a do-it-yourselfer fan of -Mystery Science Theatre 3000-, you will watch this one again and again, and find new entertainment in it every time through.",1030060800,,1479,4.923387096774194
7895474,4,6305772746,"Okay, so it's a bit hokey with lots of FRANKENSTEIN type electronics as used by mad scientist William Boyd.  (And as the other reviewer points out, NOT the ""Hoppy"" William Boyd)  It has zombies too!  What I'm trying to say is that this mad scientist is truly ""mad"".  And he gets crazier in each chapter.  He turns these scared stiff natives into big hulking, murderous giants, and this was way before the Incredible Hulk!
Then, there's George ""Gabby"" Hayes who's a no goodnik slave trader.  Who would think that the sidekick to several western heroes would stoop that low?
Well, I don't want to spoil the ending, but that mad scientist probably would've taken over the world ala Ming the Merciless if it wasn't for our hero as portrayed by Kane Richmond who braves mad scientists, slave traders, sexy jungle princesses, zombies, and other unnameable horrors through the 12 chapters.
...  But if you'd been alive in 1934 when the serial was made, you'd be dated too!",1028851200,,965,4.74251497005988
