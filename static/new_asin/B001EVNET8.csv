8299597,3,B001EVNET8,"Overly idyllic short subject from the early Sixties about two city kids who are dropped off for the summer by their parents at Uncle Jim's dairy farm.  So much of it is charming fun with puppies, kitties and baby chicks that while work is mentioned, it is rarely seen performed.  In the Seventies this nation entered the era of ""Get big or get out"" regarding family farms, and this nostalgic short looks almost hallucinatory in retrospect.  Currently rating a lousy 2.2 out of ten at the Internet Movie Database, it was lampooned -- and quite properly so -- as part of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode 607,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Bloodlust/dp/B017C46CQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000- Bloodlust</a>, and might as well be viewed that way.
