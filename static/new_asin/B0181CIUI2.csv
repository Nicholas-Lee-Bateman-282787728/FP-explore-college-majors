8741115,4,B0181CIUI2,"This disc by Mongkol V.D.O. & CD has a unique transfer of the TriStar/Mike Schlesinger cut of the film, though it's not the U.S. theatrical version (so no silly ""THE ? END"" title or reel change cue marks here). Picture is framed at about 2:1 instead of 2.35:1, though the framing on this transfer is slightly taller, so editing glue marks are visible in most shots. Unfortunately, it's a film speed PAL transfer (so the image wobbles between a progressive and an interlaced one like every half-second. Not terribly ideal for viewing on on computers), which the Thai seem to love so much for some reason. Compression ain't so great, either.

Despite what the cover says, there is obviously no Japanese track on this disc, being the U.S. version of the film and all. English audio sounds muffled and terrible (I suspect it was mastered directly from the film element provided instead of a clean source), but the Thai dub fares okay. The gigantic English subtitles do not correspond to the English track, and are for the most part the same ones found on the Hong Kong Universe Laser DVD for the Toho cut of the film. The Thai dub unusually appears to be based on this track, with stuff like ""Organizer G-1"" in the dialogue and so on. A very strange combination of the Mike Schlesinger cut editorially and the Toho version script-wise indeed!

Menus are crude at best, though are surprisingly rendered entirely in English (a particularly ugly use of ""Godzilla.ttf""). No extras to speak of other than a badly compressed version of the U.S. theatrical trailer flagged to fullscreen. There are also Japanese theatrical trailers for Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996) and Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris (1999). As for when the disc was authored, I can't get a fix on exactly when because the files use the mystery futuristic ""2/6/2036"" date found on some other Asian market discs (coincidentally the Universe Laser release I spoke of earlier).

In conclusion, this release is mostly just a play toy for more serious collectors of films in the Godzilla franchise, particularly for those with an interest in alternate/foreign versions of the movies. North American consumers (i.e. ""garden variety fans"") will probably want to just stick with their domestic R1 DVD or Region A Blu-Ray releases.",1474070400,,2277,4.8785529715762275
