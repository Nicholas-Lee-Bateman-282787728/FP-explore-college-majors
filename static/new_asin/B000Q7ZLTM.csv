2833360,4,B000Q7ZLTM,"Saiunkoku Monogatari is based in a universe that is like ancient China (Tang/Heian period) but it's a land where gods still walk among mortals and magic is still used.  In many ways, Saiunkoku is like a hybrid between The Twelve Kingdoms and Fushigi Yugi. (HINT: Not a lot of action and not a lot of romance, but a good story and you need to pay attention.)  The best thing going for the series is that the heroine is a thoughtful, educated, smart girl you can grow to like.  She can be a little too naive sometimes, and her obsession with money is hilarious, but her selflessness makes her unique.

It is a little misleading in the first story arc when we are introduced to our spunky heroine Shurei and the Emperor, Ryuki.  Hard core shoujo romance enthusiasts will love the interaction between the Emperor and Shurei during the first 8 episodes.  Truthfully though, that is as far as you are going to get with these two in terms of romance.  The rest of the series is a tangled web of intrigue and plots and counter plots enough to make your head spin. You simply can't tell if Shurei will EVER fall in love by the end of the first season (episode 39). Thank goodness the 2nd season is still running strong as of April 2007 (another 39 episodes or more) in Japan and the fans in the US are dying to catch up!

There's certainly enough bishonen male characters to go around. Is it possible to have too MANY bishonen male characters?  Nah!  Let's just say Ryuki will have plenty of competition.  Fushigi Yugi fans will be overjoyed to hear the talented voices of Tomokazu Seki, Midorikawa Hikaru and Koyasu Takehito together again on the Japanese track.  Add Tokshihiko Seki (Sanzo of Saiyuki), Toshiyuki Morikawa (Alex Rowe of Last Exile) and Nobuyuki Hiyama (Hiei of Yu Yu Hakusho) and you know you have got something worth collecting.

The character design and background detail are very eye catching, and if anything, you can just drool over how beautiful everyone is!

My only complaint is that the translators didn't stay true to form and changed Shurei's last name rather inexplicably.  Shurei hails from the famed house of ""Kou"" which means ""red,"" that is now translated into ""Hong"" which means the same thing but in Chinese.  Saiunkoku is LIKE China but NOT China.  They don't even speak CHINESE!  I think the translators should have kept the original names as intended by the manga author Sai Yukino.",1187308800,22,2411,4.659574468085107
2833361,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"With gorgeous animation, beautiful costumes, stunning scenery, a spunky heroine, and the most glorious men in all of anime, Story of Sauinkoku has everything I love about anime.

The story reminds me of my favorite Jane Austin novels.  An intelligent, ambitious young woman stuck in genteel poverty struggles to keep her family fed. Then a court official makes her an offer she can't refuse. If she can give the new Emperor enough on the job training to make him fit to run the country, she'll get enough money to restore her shabby family manor to its former glory.  The only drawback - she'll have to pretend to be the Emperor's consort.  Good thing he's rumored to be gay...

 I have the entire 1st season on fan sub copies - but I love this so much I intend to buy it for real.  And although the target demo for this is clearly female, the great animation, interesting characters and storylines make this one of my husband's favorites as well.",1184716800,13,947,4.601190476190476
2833362,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"So, for the first time in a long time, I actually started watching anime series that both hooked me, and which proved to be clever in its execution. I've seen a number of series lately that fell into the ""okay"" but not ""wonderful"" range, and had been wondering whether I was burning out on my anime viewing.

In fact, I stayed up until 3am one night, finishing the first eight episodes of ""Saiungoku Monogatari"" (The Tale of Saiunkoku), which constitute a fairly complete story arc. It's a josei (women's fiction) series set in fantasy ancient China, and the premise, while drawing on classic fairy-tale romance elements such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" is executed with a fresh touch.

Shuurei is the scholarly daughter of a noble but impoverished family. Smart and civic-minded, she had ambitions to enter the Imperial civil service, but because of a ban on women taking the civil service examinations, was forced to turn her energies to teaching at the temple school.

After the death of the old Emperor, an extended civil war left the kingdom in ruins while the emperor's many sons vied for the throne. Through a process of attrition-by-bloody-warfare and assassinations, the youngest son finally ascended the throne after the death or exile of his older brothers.

The problem is that he's a foolish, idle youth, dedicated to leisure and the pursuit of pretty young men, and unwilling to take up the reins of government. So, his advisors come up with a scheme to offer Shuurei the money her family desperately needs if she'll take the role of Imperial Consort to teach the Emperor how to govern, and to instil in him a sense of responsibility. Thinking her virginity is safe with a homosexual husband, she figures she has nothing to lose and a great service to perform for her country.

But once she arrives at court, nothing--and no one--are what they seem, and she becomes caught up in various intrigues.

Shuurei is a delightful character--unabashedly smart, practical, sternly virtuous with a deep core of compassion, and a great sense of humor. She reminds me somewhat of Jane Eyre or other Victorian heroines of impeccable moral fiber and compassionate wisdom.

The Emperor is also an interesting person, and it's fascinating to see his backstory and character revealed bit-by-bit in the first seven eps.

In any case, this series is one for my ""keeper"" shelf, and I look forward to the official DVD release.",1182643200,14,2418,4.894865525672372

8194889,3,B000Q7ZLTM,"I bought this because I had started the manga, but I just wasn't sure about it.  I mean, it's a good anime, but the manga isn't even all out so I wondered about it.",1364601600,,164,3.823529411764706
8194890,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"I just finished watching this just the other day and I was blown away at the story, characters, animation, and above and the way they kept me wanting more which is rare by the way. I love all the characters. Some are funny, some are series which makes them funny when everyone picks on him/her. and then there is Seiran not sure if he likes Shuurei but sometimes shows it. I can wait until season two is done so I can get it. At first when she was done being his Concubine the story would get boring at first I was thinking now what. I wish she would be with Ryuuki I think they make a great couple. But as far as this series goes it is my favorite. Sorry Mai HiME u just got kicked to the curb... This series just has so much more at least I think.",1201478400,,749,4.0

  Romance, comedy, nowledge, and drama makes this a great show.",1198800000,,286,4.549019607843137
8194892,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"Shurei is an only child and the youngest generation of her family. Even though her family is of the highest noble rank, political strife and economic upheaval eight years ago have left Shurei and her father penniless. They must work jobs like ordinary common folk and make money just to keep up the repairs on their rather large but crumbling estate. The only other person that lives there is fellow they have on retainer called Seiran, there are no servants or extended family.

Our story begins with one of the royal advisers. The current king of Saiunkoku is a young and reclusive man that spends most of his time in hiding. The reason for this is explained later, but the three royal advisers have become rather worried that the king's absence from public view will lead to a power vacuum that someone else will seek to fill. The strife of eight years ago will not easily be forgotten, so they are correct to be concerned about another civil war. Adviser Sho crafts a clever scheme to bring the king out of hiding by obtaining a ""wife"" for him. Because of her impeccable bloodline and need for cash, Shurei is the obvious choice among those outside of the palace. Later on at Shurei's home, Sho meets with her and her father Shoka and offers a large sum of gold which Shurei immediately accepts. Only afterwards does Shurei discover that her job is to become the king's ""consort"" for the next six months and figure out how to make him a good king. Shurei is mortified by this discovery at first, but realizing that it is too late to back out she reluctantly accepts her new position.

""Consort"" is a term that has a great many connotations, but Shurei and the king Ryuki are never formally betrothed or married and of course do not consummate their relationship. They sometimes refer to each other as husband and wife but their behavior together is more like a brother and sister. She starts out by trying to educate Ryuki (Shurei was a schoolteacher before this) but it soon become apparent that he is not stupid at all and requires no education. The business with his lazy slacker attitude was all merely an act, so really all Shurei needs to do is get him to accept his position as king act accordingly, which she is able to accomplish with great success. Even though Shurei is sharp as a tack when it comes to practical matters, she is regretfully naive about the matters of the heart. All during her six month tenure in the royal palace, Ryuki had slowly fallen madly in love with her. Due to his own inability to express this very well, the two of them never hit it off as they say and Shurei eventually leaves the palace when her job is done and goes home.

Other stories follow after the initial arc, with new and interesting guest characters introduced along the way. The first thing that I noticed when I first saw Saiunkoku is ... ""It's Fushigi Yuugi!"" ... and those were my exact thoughts. The mythical kingdom of Saiunkoku, at least in appearance, looks almost exactly like mythical kingdom of Konan that Miaka finds herself in after being drawn into the book - a kingdom of ancient China. Quite suddenly the similarity ends there. Saiunkoku's people and culture are amazingly modern in nature. Many common current themes of today's society are brought up including economic and career equality between men and women, street gang and underworld power struggles, yaoi, and even autism. I haven't seen current events/culture brought into a fantasy world done this well since the original Star Trek series. And if that isn't enough, the character development in Saiunkoku is exquisite and brilliant. Each of the main characters are very multi-dimensional and behave differently in different situations, just like we do in the real world. They were a pleasure for me to get to know and to enjoy their lives. So much of Saiunkoku is done so well, there is no way that I could not like this series.

Unfortunately my little review must end on a sad note. The Story of Saiunkoku is one of the many series that was canceled by the Geneon collapse and only the first 10 episodes were ever released. I don't know if I will ever be able to find the rest but the whole series has 39 episodes.",1195776000,,4197,4.621983914209116
8194893,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"Story of Saiunkoku is one of my favourite anime ever. It's a romantic story and yet has a great theme which is a woman standing out to have her role as government official for the first time in that age. This anime is girls' heaven (full of tasty bishonen everywhere) The art work and colors are fascinating. The historical background is well portrayed. The humor leaves you light-hearted. It's a joy and pleasure to watch this anime. The DVD is pretty. however, the audio sound is a bit low but the English subtitles is very clear comparing to other versions.",1193356800,,560,4.61
8194894,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"The first time I came across this anime was through a magazine that specializes in anime, it included a cd with three episodes of new animes (Air Tv, Saiunkoku, and Innocent Venus), watched it, and I was hooked. I loved it, so I kept watching the online videos. This is without a doubt a story worth buying. Every character has a story, and stereotypes are pretty much null. The story is constant and interesting. I could go into detail about the plot and characters, but it would serve you better do to the research yourself (plus there are other reviews that describe the story). All I can do is recommend this to anyone who is looking for a story filled with romance, intrigue, and hilarious situations. A plus to this series is the BEAUTIFUL music it has, both the intro/end song are just beautiful and fit the story perfecly.",1192579200,2,830,4.577181208053691
8194895,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"Having watched the entire series, I can say with confidence that this is the finest harem story I've watch in a long time. This series is essentially pseudo-historical fantasy drama with light hearted/comedic overtones.

I'm not a fan of the harem genre since it became fadish to have a looser for a lead character. What sold me on this series was the fact the main character is actually very admirable and thus believable as a character who can attract many faithful followers.

The Story of Saiunkoku is plot and character driven, so all of the characters are interesting. In fact, there isn't one I don't like, which is amazing. Since the series is based off a series of novels, it has a solid story that's actually going somewhere.",1189555200,4,735,4.734375
8194896,5,B000Q7ZLTM,"I bought Saiunkoku Monogatari (The Story of Saiunkoku) on recommendation from a friend who called it a Regency-Chinese-flavored fantasy and after seeing DVD 1, I can see why.

Shurei Hong (Kou in the original Japanese) is the practical-civic-minded daughter of a nobleman who is the court archivist.  Shoka, her father, is respected but poor.  The civil war that broke out after the death of the Emperor left their family destitute.

Tired of being poor, Shurei agrees to a deal with one of the elder advisors of the court that will give her family 500 gold coins.  The catch?  She is to become the emperor's consort.

Like any good heroine of certain breeding, she is horrified and dismayed but ultimately sees the bright side to her situation.

Ryuuki, the youngest of late emperor's son, has become emperor by default and seemingly uninterested in governing.

Until, of course, Shurei enters his life and nothing is quite what it seems and yet exactly as it seems which only increases the intrigue and the fun.

Although Shurei and Ryuuki are the ""main"" characters, the supporting cast is solid.  The banter between Shuei, a general, and Kouyo, the emperor's secretary, is particularly enjoyable.

I look forward to the following this series.  I hope that the rest of series lives up to the promise of the first 5 episodes.",1188604800,5,1326,4.8923766816143495
