For people not concerned with politics, they can just focus on the choreography here, which is beautiful.  For those threatened by an organization made mostly of men of color, the troupe does have white males in it and it does collaborative work with female dancers.
You only see a Maori haka at the very end of the doc.  The interviewees mention not wanting Polynesian men just to be associated with rugby.  There is a Kiwi rugby team named the All Blacks, who are not entirely Maori.  I wonder if someone could compare a doc on them and this doc of Black Grace.  Speaking of the troupes title, one member says black is just a shorthand for gutsy.  I had read in many other sources that it means of color.  I don't know if this racial dodge was planned or innocent.  However, what strikes me is that when one says Black Grace fast enough, it can begin to sound like one is saying Black Race.
The dances didn't necessarily seem ethnic.  They seemed more like men of color doing any type of modern dance.  In fact, it reminded me of Blue Man Group in some ways.  They include a performance that showed blowing up balloons, rather than moving arms and legs in unison.  Similarly, I heard the word Samoan more than I did Maori here.  I get the sense that the group is pan-Polynesian, just as many Latino artistic and political entities may be panethnic in composition.
As a documentary, this does not have to have the tensions of film or literature.  However, I held my breath as I saw the choreographer chew the dancers out for what I saw as a good practice session.  He emphasized that he wanted the troupe to be good dancers and not just an exotic lot from the South Seas.  Ive heard that sports coaches bark at their players like this and it felt sadistic to me.  But itll really get your attention if you're feeling sleepy while watching this.
On a small side note, sometimes the dancers wear what I would deem underpants, but I wonder if they see them as manly hip huggers.  When I saw What Becomes of the Broken-hearted, I wrote that I doubt any grown man would wear short shorts on a construction site and a Kiwi wrote back, They do too in NZ.  Theyre called stubbies.  Maybe these drawers have a special name in Kiwi culture too.",1390262400,,2404,4.490783410138249
