3912058,5,B002DORHRK,"I loved this show when on TV, the first I remember with the ladies as the main characters, and they played so well of each other, to see them together again was great, the years that had passed were explained so well, almost as if in real life things hadn't changed for them. The friction was still there, as was the humour; and the little details were not forgotten, like Lacey's dislike of carrying a gun, and Cagney's wanting to help out financially, only now in an even better position to do so, and Lacey still insisting on being an independant woman. (my kind of lady). Thanks for the re-run of an old favourite, look forward to more.",1261958400,2,640,4.432203389830509

3912060,5,B002DORHRK,"A veteran watcher of TV detective series since the 1950s, I think ""Cagney and Lacey"" may have been the best, most intelligent, most entertaining, least violent, detective series of all time. How grateful I am for the success of viewers' efforts during its run to keep it on the air when the powers-that-be tried to kill it. With these DVDs now, we can see these two brilliant, active women complementing each other with their skill, wit, humor, and humanity time after time whenever we like. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series at the earliest possible moment.",1256342400,2,573,4.797979797979798
