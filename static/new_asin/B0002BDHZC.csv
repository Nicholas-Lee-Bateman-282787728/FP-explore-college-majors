2684879,5,B0002BDHZC,"Once in a while, one picks up a video from the rental place based on it's cover art or crazy title. I did this back in the late 80s with this film. It instantly became one of my most favorite movies of all time. This is one of those movies that when you watch it, you think to yourself 'If I made a movie it would be just like this!'
Great comedy, you know the kind you can sink your teeth into. This movie belongs in the same category as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Rocky Horror Picture Show or Plan 9 from Outer Space. I mean that as a compliment. If you like funny movies, cult movies or just do not enjoy grapes, then give this one a try. Previously only available on DVD in a German version, this is long overdue for DVD. Yay!",1237420800,3,736,4.01360544217687
2684880,4,B0002BDHZC,"If, like me, you have a special affection for the ""so-bad-they're-good"" horror film, Psychos In Love is definitely for you.  If, however, you prefer genuine twists, carefully plotted scares, and real suspense, keep heading down the aisle.  Carmine Capobianco not only stars in this movie, he wrote, directed, and did the sets and effects, and probably sold the popcorn at the premier.  The film tells the story, such as it is, of a boy and a girl who meet, date and fall in love.  They have things in common, like a love of hacking people to death and a deep and abiding hatred of grapes and all grape-derived products.  The violence is too over the top to be scary, and the blood is pumped out like it's coming from a fire extinguisher (which it is, as the camera helpfully pans back in one scene to show some techie pumping away at a tank of it, clearly labeled ""blood."")  There isn't this much cheese in all of France and the only thing scary about this movie is that someone actually put up the money for it. Still, it IS worth a look as an example of a low, low-budget, independent, horror spoof that almost works if you don't take it too seriously.",1141516800,3,1154,4.4454976303317535

2684905,5,B0002BDHZC,"Psychos in Love, why didn't I buy you years ago?
I now live in a small space. I don't have much room for new books or movies so i give away the stuff I don't like. This, though? I'm keeping. It's not always perfect, but on the whole I got a great laugh out of it. Also, the cheesy music is part of what makes it so funny, imo.",1369440000,,326,3.739130434782609
2684906,4,B0002BDHZC,"The film is a bizarre and (mostly) clever hybrid of grindhouse gore and Annie Hall. There are frequent interruptions by Joe (Carmine Capobianco), the killer-protagonist who delivers numerous monologues in attempt to make sense of his most recent relationship.

What I found to be the most fun part of Psychos in Love is its eagerness to call attention to its low budget and lack of talent behind the camera. One sequence has a character angrily pushing away a boom mic thats sunken into frame. The titular psychos argue over the scene number of an earlier plot point. And in a complete break of the fourth wall, a murder scene culminates with the camera turning to the special effects crew, pumping tubes of fake blood with reckless abandon.",1367625600,4,741,4.834645669291339
2684907,5,B0002BDHZC,It downloaded very nicely.  I had no problems whatsoever.  I really enjoyed the film.  Thank You.  You are the finest web sites on the internet.,1365897600,,144,4.64
2684908,3,B0002BDHZC,"They did a rather good job on an obviously low budget, which is always impressive to me. They sometimes break the 4th wall, which is difficult to do without taking all credibility away from your ability to be a film maker. However, Psychos in Love pulls it off, even to the point of being funny at times.

If you're a true fan of B and sub-B horror flicks, you'll enjoy this. It's very much worth your time. Don't expect for it to go over well with just regular horror fans. First, it's more of a comedy than anything else. Secondly, they're  just regular horror fans for a reason. It's by no means a ""thinker"" but it does require an appreciation for the craft of low budget movie making all the way through.",1358726400,4,708,4.356060606060606
2684909,5,B0002BDHZC,"I have no idea how this movie have avoided me for so long, but I picked it up a few weeks ago on a whim and it's seriously the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's about a man and a woman who find out that they have two CRUCIAL things in common: they're both serial killers and they both HATE GRAPES! I won't say much more because you have to see it for yourself to believe it. Carmine Capobianco who plays Joe, and Debi Thibeault who plays Kate are both amazing and hilarious. They play well off of each other and will have you in stitches. Outside of the comedy there's actually some nice gore in the movie as well. It has some great extras like scenes from a Psychos In Love play, and other goodies. Get this. NOW! 5/5",1315785600,9,720,4.15
2684910,5,B0002BDHZC,"I just watched Psychos in Love and enjoyed it very much!  The creators and enthusiasts of this (or any) genre are treated to a sublime feeling when they recognize a special film.  This film transcends its genre classification and succeeds simply on a level of endearing art.

Though there are not many movies which are capable of being literate, exploitative, and existential all at once, this film succeeds by having appropriate amounts of each.

8155068,4,B0002BDHZC,"If you're like me and have a bit of a twisted sense of humor then the odds are pretty good that you will like PSYCHOS IN LOVE. Made in 1987 while the video boom was still going strong the movie was one of those straight to tape films that filled the shelves at mom and pop video stores across the country. With its cover depicting a wedding couple kissing while the groom is stabbing a woman and the bride is decapitating someone with a chainsaw pretty much summed up the movie in a single picture it was either one you sought out or were repulsed by. Back then I was at least curious.

At the time I wasn't all that impressed but then again I was watching so many releases while owning a store and trying to decide what to buy that I was a bit jaded. With the films release by Vinegar Syndrome I can now make a better call on if it was good or not.

Joe (Carmine Capobianco) owns a bar where he meets women. Once he finds himself alone with them rather than what most would expect, a quick roll in the hay, he instead kills them. Until he meets Kate (Debi Thibeault). Kate has the same compulsion as Joe in that she goes out with a guy, takes him home and then kills him.

As any fan of TV crime shows will tell you it usually takes a trigger to provoke a serial killer. In this case its grapes. Both Joe and Kate have an aversion to grapes in any way, shape or form as well as anyone who likes grapes. Thus when grapes or wine are mentioned they kill the person promoting them.

The couple eventually move in together and carry on with their hobby of killing people. Its not cheating as no sex ever happens and the end result is always the same, a dead body. That becomes an issue when their drain gets clogged with body parts. The good/bad news is their plumber doesnt hold that against them since hes a serial killer as well. He just asks that they give him the body parts once their deeds are done so he can eat them.

Heres where a problem comes up. Finding happiness with one another both Joe and Kate have begun to feel that they no longer need to kill anyone. Their psychopathic ways are stifled by their love life. What are they to do?

The movie is a mix of good and bad parts. The good is that there are some truly funny moments in the film. It does a decent job of combining the dark humor necessary to make it work with the gore factor that will keep gore fans happy. On the downside the acting is pretty weak and perhaps thats intentionally so. The cinematography is also very low budget. In some cases that helps with the humor as boom mics pop into a scene and are grabbed by the actors. Moments of the fourth wall being broken also add some funny spots.

Vinegar Syndrome has done a bang up job with this release. Not only are they offering it in much better condition than ever before with a new 2k scan from a 16mm camera negative. The amount of extras included here is amazing for a film thats more cult favorite than box office smash. Included are a commentary track with director/writer/producer Gorman Bechard and Carmine Capobianco (who also helped write the script and the music), a commentary track with Gorman Bechard, DIRECTING PSYCHOS an interview with Bechard, PLAYING A PSYCHO an interview with Capobianco, DISCUSSING PSYCHOS a discussion with Bechard and Capobianco, MAKING PSYCHOS a making of featurette, a Q&A session shot at Cinema Wasteland in 2016 with Capobianco, the original trailer, behind the scenes photo gallery, promotional image gallery, rough edit outtakes and extended scenes, highlights from the PSYCHOS IN LOVE stage play, four short films directed by Bechard, a booklet essay by Art Ettinger and Matt Desiderio, original artwork from Derek Gabryszak and a reversible cover artwork. Whew! Thats quite a load of extras!

As I said this movie is not for everyone and the more mainstream your movie tastes run the odds decrease in how well you will like this one. But if you enjoy the quirky, if you like movies that are a bit off base, if you sense of humor runs toward the dark end of the spectrum then youll want to add this one to your collection.",1511308800,3,4099,4.40554821664465
