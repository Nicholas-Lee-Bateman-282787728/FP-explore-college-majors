8230853,1,B000Y34SM4,"I can't tell you why, but this DVD does not provide much tribute to a good night of fights. Every UFC DVD I have watched has been excellently produced- just not this one. No instant replays, poor angles, just an awkward production of a solid event. You'll enjoy the fights, but once it's over in full speed, it's over.",1281916800,,318,4.406779661016949
8230854,5,B000Y34SM4,"Chris ""lights out"" Lytle and Thiago Alves had a great controversial fight that won the fight of the night. The main event of Bisping vs Evans lived up to the hype as well. The co-main event of Alexander vs Silva was ""surprising"" in the way it went down!",1212537600,,253,4.291666666666667
8230855,3,B000Y34SM4,"After seeing Fight Night 13, which features 5 fighters from this event(Alexander, Alves, Parisyan, Lauzon, Edgar), which 4/5 of them lost their fights at FN 13, I decided to re-watch this event. Even though the main event wasn't anything special to look forward too, that didn't mean the fights had to be bad. Still, some of them turned out really disappointing.

Akihiro Gono vs. Tamdan McCrory
-Akihiro Gono, a Pride veteran with a record of 27-12 makes his UFC debut with Tamdan McCory (10-1). The fight opens with a exciting first round with some good action and strikes by McCory. The pace lowed down in the second but it ends with a very impressive submission.

Chris Lytle vs. Thiago Alves
UFC veteran Chris Lytle(25-14) takes on the dangerous muay tai kicking machine Thiago Alves(13-3, and who just recently KO'd Karo Parisyan at FN 13). This was definately fight of the night. Both fighters came and showed the heart and skills to make a great fight and an exciting one for the fans. The fight doesnt make it 3 rounds, with a rather disappointing end but other then that, a great fight.

Joe Lauzon vs. Jason Reinhardt
Joe Lauzon(16-4) takes on 38 year old Jason Reinhardt in a reletively short but exciting fight.

Marcus Aurelio vs. Luke Caudillo
Marcus Aurelio (16-5) coming off a loss to Clay Guida takes on Luke Caudillo making his UFC debut. This is a good fight while it lasts and doesnt make it to the second round.

Spencer Fisher vs. Frank Edgar
8 and 1 Frank Edgar takes on Spencer the King Fisher (20-4) in a lightweight battle. What could have been a great fight turned out to be a really boring wrestling match with one guy dominating the entire 3 rounds. Worst fight of the night.

Ed Herman vs. Joe Doerksen
Ultimate Fighter 3 fighter Ed Herman(14-4) fights Joe Doerksen(38-10). This was a good fight and Herman really showed impressive boxing skills. Doesnt make it past the second round and a exciting finish.

Karo Parisyan vs. Ryo Chonan
One of the few guys to beat Anderson Silva, Ryo Chonan(14-8) takes on judo master Karo The Heat Parisyan(18-5). If there is one guy I thought deserved a shot at the welterweight title, it is Karo Parisyan, but after this fight, idk if I really want to see him as a champion. Very uneventful bout coming from two guys who put on a bad show. Parisyan would go on to lose his next fight against Thiago Alves at Fight Night 13.

Houston Alexander vs. Thiago Silva
After Houston Alexander 48 second knockout of Keith Jardine and 2 minute knockout of Alessio Sakara, everyone thought he was possibly top 2-3 LHW. Man i was disappointed with this fight watching it live, afterwards I didn't even want to watch the rest of the event. After seeing Houston Alexander get Ko'd in 8 seconds at FN13, rewatching this wasn't as bad. I'm starting to like Thiago Silva and hope he does well in his next fight.

Rashad Evans vs. Michael Bisping
Wow, a very disappointing main event. Evans(16-0-1) comes off a lacluster performance that resulted in a draw to Tito Ortiz at UFC 73 to take on Michael Bisping(15-1) who came off a controversial win to Matt Hamill who many believe(including myself) that he should of lost the fight. With fights like those behind them, youd think they would both come out wanting to prove that they deserved the win or whatever but they didnt. Evans and Bisping need to go back and learn how to finish fights again because this was just a bad fight. I can't stand how Rashad talks a bunch of crap before a fight and comes out doing the complete opposite. I hope Evans enjoyed his performance in this fight because Liddell is gonna show him how to finish a fight. I hope to never see either of these two hold a belt.

Overall a relatively good event with some bad matches but with some really good ones too. The production of the UFC dvd's are really improving which is always a good thing.",1208217600,4,3869,4.602322206095791
8230856,4,B000Y34SM4,"This has been criticized, and probably for good reason. One thing for me was the referees. Who the heck are Dan Miragliotta and Kevin Mulhall? They're certainly not refs that I want to see in the UFC again! But this event is in Newark, New Jersey, so they don't want Big John or Herb Dean, they want these Bozos! Let 'em have the night, they won't get another chance to be on pay-per-view! They weren't that great, but there's nothing to be done about it now.

When you think of main events, as well as co-main events, I guess the featured aren't as obvious as you'd like them to be. The headliner features winners of TUF 2 and TUF 3, Rashad Evans and Michael Bisping. But with both of these guys, they both have something to prove due to previous performances. Rashad Evans, quite frankly, should've lost to Tito Ortiz in UFC 73. If it weren't for a point being taken away from Tito in round 2, despite a great round 3 for Rashad, it still would've been a loss for Rashad Evans. So Rashad had to settle with a draw, and a loss never occured. Plus Rashad Evans is known for some split decision victories in the past. He beat Sam Hoger by split decision. In the TUF 2 Finale, his fight against Brad Imes was a split decision, and for good reason. A hard fought war between two guys who wanted a contract. And speaking of split decisions, Michael Bisping's last performance wasn't what we've seen in Michael Bisping. In UFC 75, Matt Hamil meant business, taking it to Bisping during most of the fight. The judges in that fight would give the split decision to Michael Bisping. Bisping would still defend himself and his victory over Matt Hamil. Make no mistake about it, Bisping believes he dominated in UFC 75. So, Rashad and Michael both have something to prove. They both bring undefeated records with them. And in the co-main event, some may not be aware of one or the other. That fight would be Houston Alexander against Thiago Silva. The big difference is that one is well known, the other is not so well known. NOBODY expected Keith Jardine to get smeared in UFC 71, especially to a no-namer. Houston Alexander couldn't wait, and he smeared Jardine in 48 seconds. To prove he was no joke, he took care of Alessio Sakara in UFC 75 in only 1:01, and walked away with KO of the night in that one. Thiago Silva, on the other hand, has been on 2 undercards, UFC 71 & 75 as well, but on the undercard. His first fight was a strange way to win a fight, but an injury to James Irvin after hitting the mat gave Silva an automatic TKO. When he fought Tomasz Drwal in UFC 75, it was obvious that a brawl was no problem for Silva, and he eventually got the TKO in Round 2. So Alexander and Silva get gladiator openings in the beginning as well as Bisping and Evans.

Ok, crappy referees, as well as questionable headliners, right? What about the rest of the night? Well...there are 9 fights, and they weren't too bad. I'll list them below.

Akihiro Gono vs. Tamdan McCrory: A scrappy, young ""barn cat"" from Rochester, New York is ready for a battle with a Japanese sensation. Great scrap, ends in round 2.

Marcus Aurelio vs. Luke Caudillo: Marcus is back after a split decision loss to Clay Guida. Is he ready to step it up? All I can say is that it ends in the first round.

Joe Lauzon vs. Jason Reinhardt: When you knock out Jens Pulver in UFC 63 like Joe Lauzon did, then YOU get to welcome Jason Reinhardt to the UFC and see if his undefeated record means squat. This doesn't last too long, just a little over a minute.

Thiago Alves vs. Chris Lytle: Joe Rogan's words were, ""This is ridiculous!!"" I agreed, and Lytle and Alves agreed. I wanna see these 2 go at it again, because it was a great war. Should've gone further.

Spencer Fisher vs. Frankie Edgar: This was kind of a surprise, with ""the answer"" always floating about. Unanimous decision.

Ed Herman vs. Joe Doerksen: This was a great war, somewhat screwed up with referee Kevin Mulhall, just one minor example. But the surprise is the 3rd round KO, and if you haven't seen it, I'm not saying anymore!!

Karo Parisyan vs. Ryo Chonan: Chonan has submitted Anderson Silva! Does Karo have his hands full for once? It goes to a unanimous decision.

Houston Alexander vs. Thiago Silva: Well, it doesn't go a round before somebody gets TKO'd. I will say that the winner shows immense class in victory, and earns some incredible respect from myself.

Michael Bisping vs. Rashad Evans: All I can say is that the result is a split decision. One person has to walk away defeated. You could give the argument that the victory was unanimous, but in my mind, the right man won the fight.

In the end, it is possible that the UFC has seen better days, and will see better in events to come. But I wouldn't say it is all-out horrific. It just wasn't the greatest either.",1204848000,,4813,4.425988700564972
8230857,3,B000Y34SM4,"This event got a lot of crap, but in the end it was a decent card. If I had the option of giving it 3 1/2 stars I would, I don't think it deserves to be as low as 3 or as high as 4. This event took place in November of 2007, which was an odd month for the UFC. A lot of the big fighters were either saved for the December card, already fought within the past couple cards, or were injured. This created probably one of the weakest main events as far as ""big"" fighters goes. That is really the only problem with the card though. On paper, the other matchups had ""fight of the night"" written all over it.

Preliminary Card
* Welterweight bout: Akihiro Gono vs. Tamdan McCrory
This is a great fight. Gono is making his UFC debut here against a much taller opponent. If you don't know Akihiro Gono, he is a tough veteran who formely fought in Pride. He was always a tough fight for anyone at any weight class. The fight goes into the second round and ends by submission.

* Welterweight bout: Chris Lytle vs. Thiago Alves
This is the best fight on the card hands down. Too bad this wasn't on the undercard because it probably had some of the best fireworks in any UFC event that came out this year. I don't want to give away the ending but neither fighter really loses this fight.

* Lightweight bout: Joe Lauzon vs. Jason Reinhardt
Lauzon is a rising star in the UFC and Reinhardt looks like a tough little pitbull. This one ends quick but is exciting.

* Lightweight bout: Marcus Aurelio vs. Luke Caudillo
Aurelio is another former ""Pride"" fighter who sadly lost his UFC debut. He's looking for redemption in this fight.

Main Card
* Middleweight bout: Ed Herman vs. Joe Doerkson
This is a competitive fight and actually a rematch from the past. Doerkson hasn't done to well in the UFC and Herman was labelled as one of the best fighters ever on the Ultimate Fighter show but he hasn't fully delivered yet. Either way, both these guys are tough, and this is the only true KO of the night.

* Lightweight bout: Spencer Fisher vs. Frank Edgar
On paper this looks like one of the best fights in the UFC lightweight division that always delivers. Fisher has awesome boxing skills and decent submissions, while Edgar is more known for his great wrestling, but he too has great hands and delivers a fast pace fight. This fight isn't horrible by any means, but it doesn't deliver as hoped. It is a pretty dominant win for one fighter.

* Light heavyweight bout: Houston Alexander vs. Thiago Silva
Houston Alexander is a UFC newcomer who has just blasted through the competition. He has brutally KO'd all his opponents in the first couple minutes of his past 2 fights. He looks to be the next big LHW star, but his toughest test ever is in front of him in the form of Chute Boxe fighter Thiago Silva. Silva has looked good in the UFC so far as well and is probably the better technical striker and ground fighter. I think people were let down by this fight because of how it ended, but I think it was great. It shows strength and power isn't everything, technique and being versatile in ground and standup is crucial to success in MMA.

* Welterweight bout: Karo Parisyan vs. Ryo Chonan
I was really looking forward to this fight. Parisyan has been in some of the best fights in UFC history and Chonan was making his UFC and welterweight debut. If you don't know anything about Chonan, he was another tough Pride veteran and actually has an amazing jumping leg scissor submission over the UFC's pound for pound best fighter Anderson Silva. This was another one of those fights that on paper looked like a classic in the making. Sadly it didn't truely deliver because both fighters were so tough that its hard to finish, or do anything for that matter to either guy. It goes to a decision.

* Light heavyweight bout: Rashad Evans vs. Michael Bisping
This is the only true letdown of the card IMO. As far as star power goes, this is a horrible main event. But as far as results go, it isn't nearly one of the worst main events (worse ones are Arlovski vs Buentello/ Couture vs. Belfort 2/Franklin vs. Okami/etc). It is actually a pretty competitive fight. Both are a little smaller than most LHWs and the loser will most likely drop down to MW. This fight goes to a decision, but IMO isn't as clear cut who is the winner because it was actually a good competitive fight.

In the end I think this is worth your money, I'm just not rushing to go get it. I think this card was mostly to showcase the Ultimate Fighter talent, but we get a good mix of veterans and foreign fighters in there.",1204416000,,4574,4.3959810874704495
