4126049,4,B003HTPHVS,"I don't know where this movie came from. I don't recall its being released in the theaters though, with this cast, it's difficult to believe it's direct to video. But, whatever the case, this is a rare find. It's an indy type film with nothing but writing and acting at its core. No big sets or fancy frou frou. Just a good story with a well honed cast and adroit handling by the director.

Anton Yelchin plays a bright, beyond his years, but troublesome teen who is one step away from the military academy. He has been banished to a water park for the summer where he performs a lackluster job. Eva Amurri also works there and can go to college if she can come up with the trump. Mom (Susan Sarandon) can't help her unless one of her schemes comes to fruition. She's more interested in trying to launch a modeling career for her younger daughter. Yelchin convinces Amurri that helping him sell weed to the locals is a quick way to make the dough necessary for college. She ends up agreeing and that's when things start to happen.

They could not have picked a better actress than Eva Amurri to play Sarandon's daughter. They look so similar it's difficult to believe they're not related in real life. And both do an excellent job here. I suppose I've like Yelchin enough in the few movies I've seen him in but he builds a great character here. I wanted to sit and have a beer with this guy. He is someone I truly wanted to get to know which says as much for the script as it does for his acting.

This is a slice of life type movie where everyone is in a sort of limbo. They are on their way somewhere but can't quite find the key to the door. They also have some serious baggage from their pasts which they need to drop in order to move on. Things DO come to a head and some crap hits the fan but they come to realize them for what they are and resolve themselves to deal with them instead of letting them ruin or scar them.

This movie doesn't take any obvious turns and doesn't feel a need to tie everything up in the end which I liked. I would like to re-visit all them in a few years and see what happens to them. How will their lives turn out?

This is just a plain, good movie. There is one plot point that might be a bit forced but it's a minor argument compared to the greatness in everything else that happens. I don't know if this will change your life but it's much more than a popcorn movie. If you're looking for something with meat on it's bones this is a great choice.",1285372800,6,2485,4.20125786163522
4126050,4,B003HTPHVS,"MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is one of those surprise films that appear to have gone direct to DVD - not because they are unworthy of theater showing but because they are thinking films rather than explosively entertaining/CGI/3D extravaganzas.  The script (Michelle Morgan) is smart, the concepts are viable and refreshingly not overdone, the direction (John Stockwell) shows great respect for the talents of the actors, and the cast is as solid as could be assembled for a film about touchy subjects.  The theme that is born at the beginning of this film and grows in importance right to the end is the parent/child conundrum: when is parenting adequate and what are the drivers for dysfunctional family units.

Grace Berry (Eva Amurri, in a very natural and focused tough role) explains to a college scholarship counselor (Sharon London) that she needs financial aid to begin her higher education to become a doctor, but though she is a brilliant student, the counselor refuses to award a scholarship because of Grace's exceptionally bad credit rating.  Distraught, Grace challenges her mother Rhonda (Susan Sarandon) when she discovers Rhonda has used Grace's name to open credit cards and has spent them to the limit.  Grace needs big money to attend college and her summer job at the water park in town is minimum wage only.  Also working at the water park is the happy-go-lucky Dorian (Anton Yelchin) who flirts with disaster, having found an 'extra job' selling weed to the rich folks of the city.  After a lot of patter Dorian gently coerces Grace into being his driver (Dorian has no car, having been grounded for misbehavior by his grumpy uncle who is serving as relief for Dorian's adoptive parents), and the two begin a quality friendship that fills emotional and financial gaps in each of their lives.

But the truth about Grace and Dorian's parents surfaces: Dorian was given up by his 15-year-old mother for religious reasons and has been placed with quasi-appropriate wealthy parents; Grace lives with the knowledge that her father committed suicide only to come to discover that the suicide was the result of discovering that Rhonda was (and still is)  having an affair with his brother Bob (William Haze).  Grace's discovery comes through a conversation with her Aunt Polly (Karen Bramen, in an excellent role for this new actress) and Grace's mother-favored younger sister Taylor (Willa Holland), and the revelation sets off a series of events that propels the story to an end.  Yes, there are sidebars expected in stories of teenagers: Grace falls in lust with rich kid Ben (Justin Chatwin); Taylor rebels against her mother by cutting her hair thus ending her mother's obsession with Taylor's becoming a model and Taylor seduces Dorian; Dorian confronts his birth mother; there are fights where Dorian is injured and finds himself alone without family support. But without a sugarcoated finale, the film ends quietly, affirming the importance of friends - a kind of love than can replace gaping holes in family relationships.

The movie truly belongs to Eva Amurri who proves she is becoming as fine an actress as her mother, Susan Sarandon.  The film also allows Anton Yelchin to demonstrate a much broader range to his acting than he has been given before.  The entire cast is excellent. This is a coming of age story - with far more attention being paid to the adult end of the developmental spectrum.  Grady Harp, July 10",1279324800,3,3436,4.972076788830716
4126051,4,B003HTPHVS,"NOTHING SCALDS MORE than the moment a teen discovers mom and dad aren't perfect. Not that they make mistakes, everyone does that. No, that parents and other caregivers can make HUGE, life altering errors in judgment for little more reason than ""I couldn't help myself.""
That's the motivator in this coming of age flick directed by John Stockwell (""Blue Crush,"" 2002). Grace (Eva Amurri) can't get into college because of the debt her mother accrued by opening credit cards in her daughter's name without paying them off. Dorian (Anton Yelchin), an adopted teen with a streak of mischief a mile wide, finds himself sent off to spend the summer with his disciplinarian uncles. He comes from the rich side of town, Grace arrives with both feet planted in poor town.
Yet this is no John Hughes Cinderella story. Both teens take jobs at a water park, their mission to sweat and be hassled by bratty kids for minimum wage. But then serious Grace and prankster Dorian form a team and devise a way to make money - illegally - to achieve their goals.
We learn a lot about them and their families and - big surprise - we get to like them. We actually care about their problems. No, there aren't any big tragedies or major triumphs. It's just a story about people trying to get by and it's not too bad. Conversation sounds improvised and natural. Susan Sarandon, Amurri's real mother, and Willa Holland co-star.
Blu-ray video looks just fine with a sprinkling of film grain throughout. Set in Louisiana, color is rich, especially during daylight. Audio is serviceable, mostly front centered and dialogue driven. Extras also include a 26-minute making-of offering interviews with cast and crew, much of which is repeated in a set of individual cast and crew interviews. Also find deleted scenes that were best deleted.",1279238400,,1806,4.829032258064516

8397230,4,B003HTPHVS,"A charming coming of age movie.  Rich boy Anton Yelchin is forced to work at a water park and it takes him on a new journey.  Susan Sarandon plays the dysfunctional mother of a girl played by her own daughter Eva Amurri,",1473292800,,220,4.214285714285714

8397232,4,B003HTPHVS,"I went into this movie expecting a very lightweight, insubstantial comedy, and was very pleasantly surprised at the layered storytelling and strong performances. Eva Amurri plays a smart, strong, determined young woman named Grace, whose plans for college may have been blown out of the water by her self-centered and flighty mom (played by real-life mother Susan Sarandon). Things change when she meets affable, quirky, yet troubled adopted rich kid Dorian (played by Yelchin), whose exploits have landed him a cruddy summer job as her co-worker at the local water park. Without giving away too many plot points, what develops is a semi-comical love quadrangle -- Dorian pines away for Grace; Grace crushes on dreamy-eyed water park patron Ben; Grace's pretty little sister Taylor develops a thing for Dorian. But that's only the top layer. This movie dives deeper to explore what it means to feel adrift and unmoored, and how we find our place in life. There are a few particularly affecting scenes, including the charged interplay between Amurri and Sarandon; and one especially moving conversation between Dorian and the birth mother he's briefly tracked down. The themes of friendship and abiding, non-romantic love end up resonating most strongly. And the late Yelchin once again demonstrates why he was a versatile and gifted acting gem, elevating both the comic and dramatic material in practically every way. When he's in the frame, he rivets your attention; gradually bringing out sympathetic layers in Dorian that make you both weep for and root for the character. First and foremost, see this film for moving performances like this one.",1469232000,,1648,5.1992481203007515
8397233,5,B003HTPHVS,"Susan Sarandon plays the lead with Anton. This is one of the ten movies he has on DVD. Another will soon be on DVD too. And available on Amazon. He is very talented and reminds me of Brad Renfro, who was in THE CLIENT and followed with several successful roles, and died from a drug overdose.",1394755200,2,292,4.232142857142857
8397234,3,B003HTPHVS,"Middle of Nowhere is an independent film and another example of a dark comedy that tries too hard to be funny. They had a weak storyline, but a very strong cast, and I felt it was a film that could have easily been a lot better. Dorian (Anton Yelchin) is a spoiled kid, who never had to work a day in his life. After yet another rebellious act against his parents, the seventeen year old is sent to live with his uncle for the summer. He starts working at the local water park, where he meets Grace (Eva Amurri), a girl who is his complete opposite. She is desperate to earn money for school and Dorian is looking to act out, so the two decide they can both achieve their goals by selling pot together. The story doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me, because the characters are nothing like they describe themselves to be. Dorian is rich and only there for a couple of months, he doesn't need the money, so why take the risk? Grace, she's always had to be the mature one, taking charge of her family, but we don't see her do that at all. The film is definitely a bit strange, while at the same time being somewhat slow and predictable, but what makes it worth seeing is Anton Yelchin. The Russian born, former child actor, has such charisma and really thrives in roles like this. If you saw Charlie Bartlett, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Yelchin is on another level, outgoing, energetic, quick witted, he's the kid in this film, but as it would turn out, he's also the smartest one of all. Yelchin's personality is larger than life and he will completely draw you in, sadly, other than his performance, this film wasn't much of anything. The story is predictable, the humor is dry, and the rest of the cast really wasn't anything special.",1381017600,,1766,4.387195121951219
8397235,5,B003HTPHVS,I liked this movie.  I loved the cast of characters.  I would recommend this movies to others.  This movie is well-made.,1380844800,,120,4.619047619047619
8397236,4,B003HTPHVS,"I rented this film and it was worth the money and time. Susan Surandon plays a witty and alcoholic mother who is still internally dealing with the separation of her husband and then the task of raising her two children. As with any family, the kids have their own aspirations and interests and one leads the other. The older daughter is going through an experimentation phase as she explores sex with an odd companion she meets at work. The younger sibling follows along!

This was an interesting and funny at times film. The characters are played well, but it is hard at times to follow their motivation. I believe that that was part of the way it was written, but it took me back to a time in my life, when I too was going through changes and transformation of being a teen.",1370304000,,776,4.426573426573427
8397237,5,B003HTPHVS,"I'm surprised so few people have heard of this film because it's really beautiful. It's a realist film about the relationship between two young adults who come from very different socioeconomic classes. There is a lot of pretty footage of waterparks, which I personally really enjoyed. It was very colorful and pretty. The cinematography overall was beautiful. The casting for this movie was really great too. The actors were all great and convincing. It's almost like watching an elegantly filmed cutout of someone's real life. This is a movie that I've seen many times and I still enjoy.",1362096000,,589,5.020408163265306
8397238,4,B003HTPHVS,"Movie was a lot better than I expected, I actually bought it because I lived in Baton Rouge (where this was filmed) and was an extra in the movie and thought maybe I'd see myself somewhere, haha. I am totally in 2 scenes!! haha awesome. And, to boot, the movie is actually pretty good, though I feel the ending is a little weak I liked the rest of it. I also thought Justin Chatwin's character should have had a bigger plot role, he's a really nice guy in person and a pretty excellent actor. Eva Amurri did a great job, and Willa Holland is so beautiful it's hard not to own this just to see her! It's on netflix, give it a watch, especially if you enjoy films about weed ;)",1317945600,,675,4.1603053435114505
