I saw the 1996 version because, I LOVE ANGELINA JOLIE! I read the book because I liked the movie! (I do things back wards, if I like the movie I read the book, while most other people do the opposite.)

I liked the book because it gave better backstory to certain characters and was more dramatic!

I liked the 1996 film because Angelina Jolie was in it was set in a contemporary setting and was more upbeat!

The pros of the 2014 film, It is a lot closer to the book, except two or three scenes that were in the weren't in the film, (which may be a good thing)

The cons of the 2014 film, Goldie is a lot less likable in the 2014 film vs the 1996 film, the tattoo scene in the 2014 film is non-nude.

The 2014 film is a bit more depressing and drawn out than the 1996 film.

If you want a modern upbeat quick feature w/ nudity! watch the 1996 film.

if you want a story to play on you're emotions I recommend the 2014 film.

the 1996 version is re-watchable and you walk away from it empowered and uplifted the 2014 isn't as re-watchable and leaves you feeling emotionally drained and a bit depressed!

I also have the soundtrack to the 1996 film!

847924,2,6304341202,"I saw a trailer for Foxfire around the time it came out at the beginning of an old vhs I used to own, and wanted to see it since then.  Having never caught it on tv or for rent anywhere, I went ahead and bought a cheap used copy.  If I had watched it for the first time when I was 12 or 13 I might feel differently, but watching it for the first time as an adult I was rolling my eyes and cringing through the entire movie.  Firstly, the characters behave more like giggling 13 year olds than high school seniors.  This movie felt like how a pervy adult man would imagine teen girls act.  Second, I kept thinking to myself ""Well that escalated quickly"".  Possible spoilers:  One girl is smoking pot while the others call her a ""tea head"" (for real), then 20 minutes later she is shooting heroin in a flop house.  The whole movie is like this, every situation goes from A-Z with no in between.  Another girl is lured out of an abandoned house up to a public road by some teen boys who want to rape her.  Seems like the abandoned house where she was totally alone in the woods would have been a more appropriate place for a rape.  Everything in this movie happens solely to push the plot forward, regardless whether or not it makes any sense.  The only reason to watch would be to see young Jolie desperately trying to bring authenticity to her 1D character and cheesy dialogue.  Of course she is beautiful and mesmerizing, but that just isn't enough to save this movie.  The 90s soundtrack isn't bad, but again, not reason enough to watch.  I love movies that are corny for the sake of being corny, but accidentally corny while trying to be edgy and provocative is a fail.",1457049600,4,1671,4.310897435897436

848125,4,6304341202,"This movie isn't a direct adaptation of Joyce Carol's Oates novel which was set in the 1950s, but it does convey the spirit of the novel well.  Maddy is fascinated by a strange girl who strides into her school named Legs.  With her help, Maddy and her new friends take revenge upon a teacher Mr. Buttinger, for his sexual advances upon his students. Maddy becomes enamored with Legs, to the point of neglecting her boyfriend and being distracted from her art studies.  All the girls bond together and congregated in an abandoned house in town.  It's really a beautiful film, very 90s. The script isn't perfect, but each character has her own voice.

As it is, a self-aware, humorless and clunky amalgam of The Breakfast Club, Dawson's Creek and Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants.

Obviously, Angelina Jolie was the best part of it, and she showed some real promise of what was to come....but the rest?

It was painful, and my family cheered when it was over from relief rather than exultation.

The most painful part?  Jenny Shimizu as ""Goldie"" Goldberg(Wikipedia says Goldberg, IMDB says Goldman).  Seriously.....she was cast as the upper middle class child of the whitest whitebread people in suburban Portland, who keep a loaded, shiny 1911 .45 in their living room, unlocked....and Chris Mulkey plays like the angriest parent ever to walk the planet....and she is a heroin junkie in the movie.

I thought this one was pretty cheesy in the mid 90's when it came out. How did it get so much better?? lol. I'm probably having a very nostalgic reaction as I haven't seen this one in years. To a lesbian, it's another one of those frustrating teasers like Fried Green Tomatoes or Boys on the Side where you know some of the characters are gay but nothing overtly gay is ever allowed to happen... Maddie is straight and can't even SAY the word ""lesbian,"" lol. The plot is kinda silly. The ending was sad and basically sucked. I'm sure the book is far better, even if the setting is different (50s as opposed to 90s) and the girls are less pretty. Yet it still blows on the 2012 movie version that was truer to the book.

This works because Angelia Jolie makes it work. She is the sensual and androgynous stranger (""Legs"") who comes from nowhere and draws together a group of women who fight against the men and societal rules that wrong them... their group is named Foxfire. And she's got the charisma and seductive appeal to do exactly that. I love her boyish clothes and short hair and the way the camera introduces her via those long, long legs and tough boots. Dreamy! She is that delicious mix of femme and butch all wrapped into one powerfully irresistible package.

Angela Jolie in her Hackers and Foxfire days was just too cool. And when she broke out in Gia a couple years later all long-haired femme and drop dead gorgeous, there just wasn't a more beautiful woman on the planet. It's her beauty and unique persona that brings this film to life... her chemistry with Maddie was palpable. Maddie is completely seduced by Legs. Because Angelina completely embodies that mysterious cool chick in high school that completely immobilized you with her attentions. And that's why this movie works. That's why it's still better than every crappy element about it suggests it should be.

Some of the straights don't consider this a ""lesbian"" movie at all... I wouldn't call it that either. It's a story about bonding between women, really. But the presence of Angelina and her seductive appeal to men and women alike... along with the introduction of Jenny Shimizu (as Goldie)... definitely gave the story a lez presence in a relatively recent time when we had very little presence at all in movies. Nothing more than hugging and flirting/sexual tension between Legs and Maddie. And one shirtless/boob shot of Angelina and some of the other girls during the tattooing scene.

Nostalgic stuff and worth a watch if you missed it back in the day. I still adore Angelina... but 90's Angelia was something else.",1397433600,2,2617,4.69281045751634

848409,3,6304341202,"Foxfire (Angela Haywood-Carter, 1996)

Foxfire is a great idea for a movie that, somewhere, went wrong. Not horribly wrong, really, just wrong.

It starts off well enough. Honestly, ""well enough"" describes Haywood-Carter's first (and, to date, only) full-length feature for most of its length. Rita Faldes (Pleasantville's Jenny Lewis) is a mousy high school student who nearly has a breakdown in biology class when frog dissection day rolls around. That day, a stranger shows up and drops in on class-- Legs (Angelina Jolie). Everyone assumes she's a new student, so she passes without remark, at least until she stands up for Rita, then escapes through a window (with the frog). In detention after school, the teacher, Mr. Buttinger (Point Pleasant's John Diehl), puts the moves on Rita, and is stopped by a Legs-led cabal that also contains Maddy Wurtz (Boston Common beauty Hedy Burress), Violet Kuhn (Slaughter Party's Sarah Rosenberg)-- whom said teacher had also accosted-- and, as a latecomer, Goldie Goldman (The New Women's Jenny Shimizu). The five of them, flush with success, end up suspended for three weeks, during which time they bond at an abandoned house on the woods where Maddy often goes to indulge in her photography habit. As they grow more self-sufficient, however, they find themselves increasingly unable to fit into the conventional society beyond the woods.

What is fundamentally wrong with the film is not, actually, the film itself-- most of it, anyway. The parallel between the growing power and self-assurance of the girls and their increasing outcast status is exceptionally well-handled, and that power and self-assurance is depicted with just the right amount of discomfort on both the parts of the girls and the parts of the viewers. As should be expected in any movie based on a novel by the redoubtable Joyce Carol Oates, there is a great deal of subtext to be had, and it all works quite nicely. For ninety-seven of the film's hundred two minutes, this is some good stuff, here.

Then come the last five minutes, and everything goes down the tubes. Storylines simply disappear. Things which had been depicted subtly and effectively earlier in the film come back, and their symbolism is rammed down the viewer's throat. Characters disappear. It's as if a different, and incompetent, director took over for the film's final scenes.

Final score: ** ?. Would have been four had the ending been at all worthwhile.",1145577600,3,2448,5.079601990049751

848412,4,6304341202,"Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her & Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina.

As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism.

At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe.

However, I did like Maddy and Legs, the two main characters, but the other characters that made it into the movie are not well developed at all. And the 5 that make up the group ""Foxfire"" are strangers at the beginning of the movie who we are expected to assume half way through the movie with virtually no dialogue amongst them are closer than sisters.

  If you do accept this assumption the second section of the movie will draw you into their world. They are tough, together and having fun. But then again there is a quick shift and the ending flashes through major life events like losing a loved one, crime and drug addiction with no real depth.

  Even with drastic cutting from the book the movie obviously tried to tackle too much of that great story and ended up with very little of the sincere connection these girls had and the motivation that their connection gave them to fight against anyone who tried to endanger the closeness of the group.

  Read the book, and if you watch the movie don't expect too much from the plot, focus on the two main characters and you might be able to enjoy it.",1128556800,7,1203,4.431818181818182
848414,5,6304341202,"By far the most beautiful scene in Foxfire is the ""tattoo"" scene. It demonstrates and celebrates the separate identity that a woman must sometimes have. She by spends most of her time in the shadow of men, reliving what they have already done by the eyes of society and this scene showed them far removed from man all together. If a woman is thought of as strong, she is either a dyke or a ball buster. But a woman is never seen as strong and a woman. I feel this scene showed the true depth a woman is and by far the most incredible truth of a woman; she can be strong yet feminine. By revealing ONLY her breasts, she shows the nature of being a woman. By showing only the chest, she shows how separate she is from man. By showing only her breasts, she shows the essence of womanhood. And nothing is removed from her, not even a little bit. She shares her vulnerability enough to show that she really isn't vulnerable at all. It is a myth man places on women in order to keep them subdued and domestic. Foxfire is a celebration of two things, womanhood and friendship. This movies shows women taking back what most men don't see as valuable, a female's sexuality.

The basic story is that a girl, Maddy finds herself thrown into a world of four new friends within the first ten minutes of the movie. This mysterious girl, Legs comes into her science class and the next few weeks of Maddy's life changes forever.

Five girls come together after beating up a teacher for sexually assaulting two of them. They're suspended from school and live together in an abandoned house. They accidently start a fire in the school and well...I'll let you find out what happens after that.

Let's just say, if you're a teenager looking to run away from home like me, rent or buy this to escape just for a few hours. You'll want to beat up a teacher and get a tattoo :)

I had to turn up the volume really high, but I always put on the captions anyway so it was okay for me. And in the beginning you can definitely tell it was based form a book how they were just skipping to different scenes here and there.

But I still LOVED it!",1106092800,4,1312,4.190476190476191

I got the urge to see it after renting the ""Girl,Interrupted"" DVD and falling in love with Angelina Jolie and then seeing the preview for this on the DVD.The movie in fact is pretty damn good. It's sad and funny and Angelina Jolie is incredible. The movie is about 5
High School girls starting with Maddy(Hedy Burress),a young,pretty,and intelligent art student. Rita(Jenny Lewis) a typical high school girl that is the one chick in Science class that doesn't wanna disect(If that's how you spell it) the frog.
Goldie(Jenny Schmizu) a chinese and/or japanese drug fiend.
Violet(Sarah Rosenberg) a perky ""social"" chick. And last Legs
(Jolie) a young rebel passing through town to town. When Rita is sexually assaulted by a teacher,the five girls join foreces and teach him a lesson. In other words they beat the crap out of him.
They're suspended and start hanging out at an old abandoned house and all discover their true selves I guess you could say.
I really don't know why I liked this movie,the movie is a chick flick at heart. It's a sad film,but Angelina Jolie shines and makes it more sad then it's meant to be. Go see this movie. B+",1085356800,4,1188,4.688995215311005

I first hired this film to watch because Jenny Lewis is in it as well as Angelina Jolie. I love the character Legs portrayed by badarse Angelina. Angie's so cool. Jenny did a well done job as the insecure Rita, Jenny always has spunk about her. All five girls are good as their characters. This film left an impression on me about friendship and will remain close to my heart. I recommand this to anyone thinking about seeing this film.

848546,4,6304341202,"Foxfire is a film about the intense nature of friendship forged in unusual events, and about what friendship really is and isn't. Five girls come together who weren't previously friends when one confesses that a teacher sexually abuses her. Another of the five confirms her story and they decide to make it stop. What happens next is that they all risk a great deal to be there for the abused girls, and the friendship that comes out of the experience is unbreakable. Throughout the film they take care of each other in a way that you'd expect from family, which is telling of the fact that by taking risks for each other and being true friends they have formed bonds of real sisterhood. This is a movie that adolescent girls will appreciate especially, but all people will enjoy. The chord it strikes in people who seek true friends is something not easily forgotten. This movie is more than a chick flick, and it's more than a story about female rebellion, it's a celebration of the nature of real friendship.",1033776000,6,1011,4.653631284916201

The movie is in a nice package.. music, dressing, etc., down to the minute details.  those details wouldn't be so insignificant if they ended in some sort of thing.. a climax, something useful.  Sometimes it seems like a nuttin dressed up, trying, trying really hard to be something real.  To mimic kids; hopefully not mocking; be symbolic, or just another teen flick.  But who is the exact target audience of this thing? Young girls... no too obvious.  It wouldn't hold the average 13 yr. old's interest, trust me on this one. Young women, certainly they would have gone past that by watching Clueless a few dozen times.  Any Male; perhaps, but only if the individual were poetic or in order to check out the cast with the likes of Angelina Jolie. Dont Worry Though, there is a bright side.  Even though there isn't much of a plot, if you are in an appropriate mood, the superb acting (by such a wonderful cast, such great actors), music, ideas, potential or hopefully its essense will keep your attention sealed. It has plot twists, but predictable ones.  (As far as poetic..) Well, I think the movie is what you make of it. It does have something about it; something I can't quite pinpoint, that makes it enjoyable.  And the chemistry between the girls is fabulous as they do things like saving each other from abusive teacher relationships, breaking into a school, and discovering each individual soul the way it should be.

I want to see it I want to have a hollywood movie that gives it to me....but.... It's not here, unless you are brian dead. The movie is cheesy, badly filmed, badly directed, badly scripted, badly adapated, in consistant, and yes as the creepy sexist guy said it feels like an after school special.

Fallen for the characters, the rage...  and the rewind button pulls you back to reality. The musique is amazing, as its a perfect companion to the mood of the movie....

The main plot stays the same - five girls, each with troubled pasts, gang together to stop the world from messing with them ever again.  They start by beating up a teacher who sexually harasses and molests female students that he keeps after school for detention, and it escalates from there, climaxing when the girls realize they've taken things a bit too far.  The girls in the movie express such power, and their close ties with each other are heart-rending, especially at the end, when Maddy says goodbye to Legs.

The movie is miles and away  different from the book it's based on, and not just due to the setting. The  relationships between the girls are slightly altered, not to mention a good  number of the girls are left out.

7868440,4,6304341202,"Not a bad movie. Four girls meet a mysterious and beautiful stranger, and she encourages them to take revenge on their sexually abusive pedophile Science teacher. Unfortunately, their plea falls on deaf ears and they are suspended from school, but break in when one of them needs her art and accidentally cause a fire. The girls become known as Foxfire, but their friendship and hard-earned freedom becomes a trap when the local jocks try to teach them a lesson. The girls find themselves in a violent trap.
Overall, not a bad movie. Great script, Angelina Jolie is a great actress and the tattoo scene albeit showing nudity was beautifully acted. The only issues I have with the DVD is they neglected to give this movie a 5.1 surround audio track and the only supplemental feature is a theatrical trailer. I hope Paramount Pictures (the current distributor and owner via their acquisiton of Rysher films) releases a remastered DVD and Blu-Ray soon, But, I doubt that will happen anytime soon.",1502323200,,993,4.881656804733728
7868441,5,6304341202,"I was 18 years old when the casting director announced to me and the hundred or so other teen extras, ""The stars of this movie will be the big stars of tomorrow."" I sat there in the classroom among my peers at Lincoln high school in Portland, Oregon, and I sort of rolled my eyes. I doubted that anyone in a low-budget movie being filmed in Portland would one day be a big star.  So imagine my shock when I found this movie in a video store a few years ago and looked at the credits: ""Starring: Angelina Jolie.""  I thought to myself, ""Wow! The casting director was right!""  She was a complete unknown at the time,  with the biggest star at the time being Jenny Shimuzu.

So, this movie is a great time capsule for me as I get nostalgic about my teen years. It's great to turn on this movie and see myself and my high school classmates wandering around in a crowd with not-yet-famous Angelina Jolie. So the nostalgia and sentimental factors enough to interest me. This is a wonderful time capsule of my youth.  But on its own merits, I'm not sure this would interest other people.  It is the kind of movie you would expect a major Hollywood star would have been in BEFORE they became famous. Diehard Jolie fans, and people nostalgic for their teen years (such as myself), will love this movie. I'm not sure about anyone else.",1501718400,,1324,4.3795918367346935
