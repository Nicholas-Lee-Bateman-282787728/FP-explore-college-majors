3821380,5,B001VEF7ZM,Takes me back to when I was a child and watching it on VHS.  I got my five year old daughter into liking them.  I am glad to pass down classic cartoons to my children.,1330646400,,167,3.742857142857143
3821381,5,B001VEF7ZM,"great videos, makes me feel like i'm a kid again, watched all these cartoons 35 years ago, if you are kinda feeling old get these videos and they will make you laugh and feel young again",1326585600,,186,4.194444444444445
3821382,3,B001VEF7ZM,Real bad packaging- ALL 4 discs are individually packed in individual paper sleves and stuffed together in the center of a dvd case. Seems to me that they will easily crack. I SENT ON TO MYSELF AND ONE AS A GIFT AND I WISHED I DIDN'T GIFT ONE.,1324857600,,243,4.083333333333333
3821383,5,B001VEF7ZM,My son loves the old cartoons that I can still remember from my childhood.  This was a great collection and incredibly inexpensive for the amount of cartoons it comes with.  We've already recommended it to several friends that have also loved it.,1324339200,,246,4.833333333333333
3821384,5,B001VEF7ZM,"I'm a teen and cartoons in the newer generations just aren't as entertaining as the classics. I was so excited to see this at my local Toysrus while Christmas shopping. It was a ""2 Movies for 5 Dollars"" promotion, so I got this for a steal! I've watch many episodes and was filled with nostalgia.",1324252800,4,296,4.4
3821385,3,B001VEF7ZM,"The 200 Edition does not contain either Mighty Mouse or Woody Woodpecker.  What is printed on the cover is the same as the 600 edition.  I only have this one.  Since these characters are missing, I can only assume that they are only available on the larger 600 edition.  I'm not sure who that frog is, most of these are before my time and I'm in my late forties.  It's a good collection especially for the massive amount of Popeye and Gumby.",1315699200,7,441,4.329268292682927
3821386,2,B001VEF7ZM,"To anyone who mistakenly bought this collection believing they would find the original cartoons as they were intended will be upset to discover the shorts have been censored.

I am taking a History and Theory of Animation course and we discussed the Fleischer brothers. We watched the short ""Is my palm read"" and I bought this collection because it contained that short. I thought, being that it is the 21st century, all the shorts would appear as they were intended. This specific cartoon had entire pieces missing.

This may really only matter to those Cartoon fans deliberately buying this collection for Betty Boop. All her best slightly suggestive shorts appeared before the production code and on this collection even the good ones are censored. That was her thing, being a flapper girl. She was sexy and all the creatures and things she encountered wanted to grab her and have their way. All of that is missing.

Betty Boop disappeared after the production code was enforced because her appeal was lost and on this DVD the same thing has happened.

My suggestion is not to buy this.",1287532800,121,1089,4.838709677419355
3821387,4,B001VEF7ZM,"The print quality varies with the original media.  Some of these might have been captured from old film prints, but a lot of them are the ""TV"" versions of much older cartoons, with syndicate titles spliced on.  These were digitized off of old videotape; in many cases the sound is warbly and sometimes the picture smears out due to bad tracking on the video play head.  Still, picture quality is acceptable on 90% of these cartoons.

Disk 1 is all Betty Boop and Popeye.  There are a few of the substandard Popeye cartoons made for King Features, but most of them are good ones from the Fleischer studios.  ""Big Bad Sindbad"" is repeated on disk 4 as ""Popeye Meets Sindbad the Sailor.""

Disk 2 has the most dubious content, as well as the worst overall picture and sound quality.  Here we have such un-funny relics as:  The Toonerville Trolley, Herman, Mr. Piper (which I would hesitate to call ""animation""), and the excremental New Three Stooges.  Those Stooges cartoons need to be burned and the ashes jettisoned into space.  They are the worst thing I have ever seen.

Disk 3 is the jewel of the collection:  A random assortment of classics from 1929 up into the 1950s.  Lots of Fleischer, Van Beuren, Famous Studios, strange corporate-sponsored animation ... there's ""The Story of Time,"" an AMAZING clay animation that was made for Rolex, and ""The Sunshine Makers,"" a creepy Van Beuren milk propaganda cartoon made for Borden.  Also notable is a psychedelic Driver's Ed piece called ""Once Upon a Time.""  We also have some badly-animated and not-funny musical cartoons produced by British legend John Halas.

Disk 4 has ""Fraidy Cat"" which is a cleverly written if badly animated TV cartoon from the late 1960s.  It has a laugh track.  Lots of Gumby cartoons will remind you how bizarre Gumby was.  ""Hoppity Hooper"" is a Jay Ward production, exactly like ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" but with a different cast of characters.  Very well written.

If you like old cartoons, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Young kids will probably be bored and/or confused by it, but it's a gold mine for the animation geek on a budget.",1264982400,38,2114,4.763085399449036

3821423,3,B001VEF7ZM,"There are only four discs in this collection. I have a 12 disc collection which features many of the same cartoons. The quality here is the same as any other collections. Film preservation wasn't a high priority for cartoons and animation in the early decades. There are still highly entertaining and I don't know about the censorship or the code era affecting them.

On disc one, ""Betty Boop"" and ""Popeye"" dominate the disc with numerous cartoon shorts in color and in black and white. Disc two features ""Mr. Bang, Katrinka, & The Skipper;"" ""Casper;"" ""Felix the Cat;"" ""Gabby;"" ""Herman;"" ""Little Audrey;"" ""Little Lulu;"" ""Mr. Piper;"" ""The Three Stooges;"" and ""Tom & Jerry.""

Disc three includes ""Baby Huey;"" ""Heckle & Jeckle;"" ""Hunky & Spunky;"" ""Mighty Mouse;"" ""Raggedy Ann;"" ""Woody Woodpecker;"" and other classics. Disc four features ""Fraidy Cat;"" ""Gumby;"" ""Hoppity Hooper;"" ""Popeye;"" and other classics including the Oscar winning ""Moonbird"" and not the original ""Wizard of Oz of course.""

If you enjoy cartoons from another era, you would enjoy this batch but I would stick to the 600 cartoon collection which features probably the 200 cartoons here and 400 more. It's the better bargain.",1446508800,2,1190,5.155440414507772

3821425,1,B001VEF7ZM,"Packaging lists Woody Woodpecker as well as Tom and Jerry.  No Woody Woodpecker.  The ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons are actually ""Dick and Larry"" - while Dick and Larry were originally named Tom and Jerry, they were renamed Dick and Larry in the 50s so as not to confuse them with the more popular cat and mouse duo.  It seems like a bait and switch, as most would expect the more well known Tom and Jerry.",1443484800,,401,4.32

So 50% is great and 50% not so great in my opinion. I like Pop-Eye and Betty Boop. I'd never seen Betty Boop cartoons before, only her image. This disc set made me a fan. Luckily both of those are on the same disc so I don't have to switch around. I enjoy this collection, but still I can't help but be a little disappointed.

This company did absolutely no attempt to clean any of these up, the sound of scratchy and unclear, the cartoons are, in some cases not centered, jumpy, blurry, mottled, damaged and everything you would expect from something this cheep.

But there are some gems in the collection, mostly by the Max Fleischer Studios as well as some early Gumby Adventures and certain episodes of Hoppity Hooper that fell into PD.  The Fleischer Studios productions look the best and hold up well in terms of humor and content.  They were amazing animators and artists, every bit the equal to Disney.

Did not find any Woody Woodpecker cartoons on these dvd's. Also take note that the Tom and Jerry cartoons are the old Van Beuren B/W tunes that were renamed Dick and Larry so they wouldnt be confused with the classic cat and mouse.,1336435200,2,383,4.565217391304348
