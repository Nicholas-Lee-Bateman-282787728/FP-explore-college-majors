It records the brain waves of a seeing person looking at something (say a relative the blind person hasn't seen for a long time).  Then the blind person plays it back and ""sees"" the image (and either they get the sound memory too, or they recorded that in the ordinary way--I don't know whether they address that).  I guarantee you will *not* predict the unexpected outcome(s), despite how predictable they appear after you see them.  (And giving any hint about that outcome *would* be a spoiler.)

The 7 hour director's cut (and presumably the 5 hour one) aren't any more interesting than this one, but they have finally been released and you'll want to see them if you're a fan of the movie.
