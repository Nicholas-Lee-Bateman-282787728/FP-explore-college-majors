8727095,5,B01399KHTW,"As a mother, an educator, and a woman who was not given any sex ed as a young person, I highly recommend this video. I loved it! As a parent I knew ideally what I wanted to tell my kids, but now after watching Jackies video I have the words and an action plan. Im now aware of surprising and unexpected adolescent sex data. The video also helped me understand the issues teens face today, which are so different from when I was a teen.

This video is for any kind of parent -- for those that just don't know how to start the conversation or those for whom the mere idea of having the conversation makes them uncomfortable. I also think that both religious and nonreligious parents would agree with and appreciate this material.

Time to get our heads out of the sand! Our kids need us. Im so glad I stumbled across Jackies  website and this program. I feel informed and confident in my ability to support my child through their preteen and teen years.",1469059200,,951,4.361581920903955
8727096,5,B01399KHTW,"Jackie Brewton's ""The Sex Talk Every Parent Needs to Have"" presents a wealth of knowledge, motivation, tools and techniques to equip every parent for that all-important responsibility of preparing their children to be fully informed and motivated to make sexual decisions that will set them up not only to successfully navigate the scary teenage years, but also to set them up to be successful adults and to have successful families, due to the choices they make about sex during their teen and early adult years.  For parents who take their responsibility seriously to have ""the sex-talk"" with their teen boy or girl, this excellent DVD will thoroughly prepare you with the foundation and the 'nuts and bolts' of what you need to know and to discuss with your teen, and how to do it in ways that your teen will actually listen to, understand and adopt as part of their personal values.  These tools will help your teen understand how important their future is, and how it can be effected forever by decisions they make as a teen without fully understanding the consequences.  It will give your children a ""Bigger Yes"" to strive toward - as in, 'Yes, I want my future wife or husband and kids to have a better life, unencumbered by the 'unfortunate yes' choices I otherwise might make concerning sex while young and trying to fit in'.  It will provide them with whole new understandings and bigger horizons to aspire to, and thus inoculate them against peer and media pressure, or simply the poor decisions teens often make because their brains aren't yet fully developed.  As a chaplain, I use this DVD in my ministry to parents of kids in my local juvenile detention center, but it is a DVD that all parents should get to be fully confident in making the all-important 'sex-talk' with their pre-teen or teen boy or girl, or in correcting their own understandings of what it means to be a responsible mother or father, for the sake of their children.  I highly recommend this invaluable DVD become part of every prepared parent's arsenal of effective parenting tools - you will never be sorry you've made this invaluable investment in yourself, and then in your teens.",1468972800,,2169,4.786096256684492
