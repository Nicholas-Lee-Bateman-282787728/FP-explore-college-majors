5061891,5,B0077PBPSM,"I guess we all grew up with Melvin from the West Side of Baltimore in 1942. From Booker T. Washington Jr High School, Baltimore City College. Melvin shot dice all day at City College. Melvin had an IQ of 180. Melvin could have been a doctor, astronaut or scientist. We grew all those professions in the West Side of Baltimore. I am not defending Melvin. There is nothing to defend. But where did Melvin get the drugs from? Where did the guns come from in America?

5061897,3,B0077PBPSM,"Sometimes in life it's good to get a different perspective. It's good to see someone who has been in a worse position than you, so that you can appreciate what you have just a little bit more. Every once in a while it's good to see someone like that make the most out of the second chances they've been given as well. It's empowering, enlightening and cause for celebration. Melvin Williams is one of those types of people and his documentary is quite fascinating to watch.

Melvin Williams was a child genius, and a professional gambler by age twelve. By teaching himself how to control dice, playing cards, and being a pool shark, he was a millionaire by the age of fifteen. He was a force to be reckoned with and a powerful figure on Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore. After Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down, the City officials would call on Williams, now age twenty-seven, to help stop the riots. The police were left bewildered that someone like Williams could get the rioters to stop and go home when they could not do that themselves. They now saw Williams as a threat because ""Someone who could stop a riot, could certainly start one."" The powers that be planned to frame Williams and put him in the penitentiary. For Williams, this would mark the beginning of a twenty-six year struggle behind bars, and trying to clear his name for being framed by a hypocritical government.

Now Williams could have saved himself a lot of grief had he not made the choice to become the ""Heroin King of Baltimore"", a decision he made after he was released from prison. He had been put there through the combination of a rat informant, and a crooked police officer placing narcotics in his pocket. Melvin had the choice to let it go, and be a free man. He chose to become the king of what they falsely accused him of in the first place, and like all his other endeavors, he became the best at what he was doing. Once again, it was the result of an informant that got him put away again, this time for over twenty years. Since his release, Melvin has gone the straight and narrow path, teaching people about staying away from the lifestyle he belonged to and spreading his message in the classroom. He has been the subject of several films over the years, and has even had a supporting role in the T.V. series ""The Wire"", playing a minister. Will Melvin Williams continue on his current path of law abiding citizen? Only time will tell us that.

Eyes Wide Open films presented a fairly decent documentary about the life of someone who I had never heard of until I watched the program. At a short sixty minutes, we are thrown right into the story. It was a little frustrating at points because I didn't know the time frame of the events going on for quite a while. Then there are the re-enactments. They are short, and littered throughout the film, but seeing cell phones being used in the mid-seventies, along with body piercings and tramp stamps didn't do much for authentication. It was good to see that Williams told the story himself, and is on camera for a lot of the movie's running time. The narrator of the film isn't used too much, and that was a bonus as he doesn't have the voice for it. It turns out he is also the director and producer, so too many hats were worn by him. Williams could have carried the story by himself. The only other annoyance was some of the music. It's an instrumental rap style music, which pretty much fits the story, but at points it's so loud that you have to strain to hear what people are saying. I found the story as a whole mildly entertaining, and had hoped that there would be some extras on the DVD, but there are none to be found. Shot in full frame, the picture looks pretty good for all it needs to be. It's a good time waster at only an hour. Check it out. 6/10",1372032000,,3807,4.435714285714286
5061898,5,B0077PBPSM,"I have a weakness for documentaries, especially those whose subjects I am not too familiar with, and those which teach me something new. ""Heroin King of Baltimore - The Rise and Fall of Melvin Williams"" is one of such films. It takes a fascinating look at a quite a smart human being who was apparently pushed to violate the law, and then find redemption.

Melvin Williams was a gifted, young African-American that was meant to triumph in whatever he did. Growing up in Baltimore, he sold newspapers in his early years, and being in the streets, he also got hooked on gambling during that time. He was master at playing dice - he studied the game in detail -- and was kicked out of school. By age 15, he was already a millionaire. With this sudden flush of money, a time came in which he had to hire a bodyguard, especially because he made some people really angry. As time passed by, he is sold by an informant - and good friend -- to the DEA, and is accused of cocaine trafficking - at that time, Williams was only a mayor gambler. According to Williams, ""A rat is not a rat because he chooses to be; a rat is a rat because that's his nature."" So Williams went to trial on fabricated charges, and, after finishing his jail time, he promised himself that he was going to be the best dope dealer ever. And that he did, for sure, and the documentary focuses on his successes and mistakes. In the end, he realizes that crime doesn't pay. It is also important to note that Williams was respected in his town, to such a degree that he was asked by local politicians to help mitigate the anger in the crowds after Martin Luther King's assassination. Late in life, and based on his experiences in seeing the prisons significantly crowded with black men, he concludes that, ""It's not a war against drugs; it's a war against black folk.""

Although ""Heroin King of Baltimore - The Rise and Fall of Melvin Williams"" is mostly narrated by Williams himself, David Simon (producer of ""The Wire""), Leroy Carroll (former District Attorney) and Clarence Mitchell IV (former State Senator) are also interviewed in the film. In addition, even though the film was about the life in crime and redemption of Melvin Williams, it also deals on how the system is abused by politicians and cops as a matter of convenience. This is a definitely a story that needed to be told. (USA, 2013, color, 60 min).

It reminds me of a project I did in high school and nobody could hear my video slides because I didn't turn the background music down while the video played.
