Both my wife and I were in awe with the quality of the acting and superb storyline. This is a can't miss, get it as soon as you can. It is definately the jewel of our collection.",1068336000,2,286,3.847457627118644
1882741,5,B00009AV85,"Reading over the reviews, i realized some people may have missed the fact that NBC actually did show all 6 episodes, and Bravo showed them later, and uncut i believe. i Know because i watched the show on NBC. While i am disappointed it was not made into a series, i can understand why.
Moving on, i would say this was a great show. IT had everything. Violence, family love and loyalty, everything.",1067558400,2,397,4.4520547945205475
1882742,5,B00009AV85,"KINGPIN, is one of my favorite movies/shows.  Why NBC cancelled the series is beyond me.  However, by reading some of your posts, I don't think that you were aware that BRAVO actually CONTINUED the Kingpin series, and resolved everything over 4-5 more episodes....I don't want to spoil everything that happened, but if you want to know, write a post (reply), and I'll tell you.  ***YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED***, It was ""off the hook""!!!! I love it!! I love it!! I love it!!  Now my question is:  Where can we buy the ENTIRE series (NBC&BRAVO).
Some spoilers (not too much in detail, don't want to ruin things):
** Rape -- can't tell you who it will spoil things.
** Murder -- connected to the ""rape"", and war between families.
** Resolution to the Agent who was almost killed (the ultimate drug bust).
** Resolution to Malika Yoba (dirty Agent) and the nightclub.
** Wife leave rehab and returns home to Miguel.
** Dr. loses his money...Dr. finds his money (but hands change...i.e. dr/bodyguard relationship)

1882743,5,B00009AV85,"This was one of the greatest crime series/mafia productions I have ever seen.  It was captivating throughout much like the sopranos except dealing with the mexican cartel.  How NBC could cancel this series is beyond me.  I bought the dvd after viewing the recommendations and was blown away.  If it were to land again on NBC I would be a faithful watcher of the show.  How can we petition NBC to give it another try?  It is injust how such low quality shows remain on the air and a show of this magnitude (which was far too short - only 6 episides) could be canceled.  I highly recommend buying the dvd if you are a fan of the sopranos, scarface, godfather, casino etc...  Please NBC bring back Kingpin - this is an outrage to many of its legions of fans.",1065225600,10,755,4.3428571428571425

1882745,5,B00009AV85,"One of the most amazing crime dramas I've ever seen. NBC made really weird programming decisions by having this show on twice a week for three weeks in a row. It didn't get the coverage or the justice that it deserved. Where is the next season? You guys over at the peacock network need to give us our Kingpin!

To me, I think Mexicans and Italians are extremely similar, my e mail is ...... if u wanna know how they are... Miguel Cadena is a lot like Micheal Corleone both smart educated men and both head's of their family, This show hits hard to home because i live in El Paso TX, and it was pretty much filmed here, but overall this is one of the best organized crime show,movie,ect... i've ever seen and i hope they are making a second season, the first was phenomenal it's a must have in all homes.",1060819200,3,597,4.191304347826087

Although it wasn't given enough time to develope the six episodes were explosive and with a cast of very well potrayed characters.  Although you can never compare a movie to such likes as the ""GODFATHER"" ""GOODFELLAS"" ""CASINO"" ""A BRONX TALE"" SCARFACE"" ""CARLITOS WAY"" you won't want to leave this one out of your collection.  And if you're a hispanic, it's just great to see our own representing the life of crime that some of us live to survive....OVERALL THIS IS A MUST HAVE!",1054080000,5,622,4.678899082568807
1882749,4,B00009AV85,"This 6 episode (3 disk) series was made for and recently aired on network television, but in my opinion was quite successful in narrowing the distinction between traditional TV fare and far more graphic projects usually associated with pay cable offerings. It is the saga of a fabulously wealthy Mexican crime family presiding over a global drug cartel, and the 6 episodes define how the power of that family was violently consolidated under the quiet and cunning leadership of Miguel Cadena,(Yancey Arias). Much of what was done has been done before and inevitable comparisons to ""The Godfather"" are sure to be raised. But with a mostly Hispanic cast, cultural values usually associated as south of the border, and highly imaginative plot twists, this work is sometimes brilliant. The production values of this series more closely resemble that of film rather than episodic weekly television. With just 6 episodes in the can, I think the series ended a bit too soon, and this viewer was left wanting more.",1052870400,35,1006,5.029940119760479

1882794,3,B00009AV85,"Kingpin: 5 out of 10: As seen on NBC and inexplicably spread over three DVDs, The six hour mini-epic Kingpin is now available to all those who blinked and missed it. Visually stunning with great sets and production values Kingpin certainly looks great. The story is another matter.

Scarface minus The Godfather plus American Family then mix thoroughly with network standards and practices and you really have a mess. This story cries truly for more sex and violence.

The acting is a mixed bag with Yancey Arias giving a great performance as the head guy. Sheryl Lee chewing scenery as his shrewish Anglo wife and most embarrassingly Brian Benben hopelessly miscast as an indebted mule/plastic surgeon. Yep it is Nip/Tuck meets The Shield without the grittiness of either as well as a lot of unsubtitled Spanish to wade through.

After you watch the first twenty minutes you will say to yourself hey this is really cool. Do yourself a favor and turn off the TV. It is the only way to preserve the feeling.",1258848000,2,1006,4.7701149425287355

This was the only season of the show and When you view it like I did over a couople of days You kinda wish there was more . The fact there wasn't means NBC gave up on this series before the audiences found it . It would of been better served on a cable station like HBO but NBC gave this one good actors and nice production values. Plot was good and full of violence and sex and of course Family ties.

1882798,4,B00009AV85,"Miguel Cadena (Yancy Aria) is a young American educated Mexican in the employ of one of the biggest drug runners in the country. This mini-series tells his story not only directly through his eyes, but through the lived of those his business touches as well.

When the drug lord goes insane and finds a price on his head, Miquel and his brother take matters into their own hands. Seeing the time is ripe to make their move, they take out their boss and attempt to maneuver themselves into his role. Just to insure things, they take out his son, the next in line as well.

But their plan gets twisted when the boss' brother comes out of retirement for the time being to run things. Even with him in charge, the pair make moves to increase not only their business, but their power as well.

As all of this goes one, we are also brought into the family life of Miguel. His wife (Sheryl Lee) is a high powered attorney who helps him in many of the decisions he must make. The pair is the doting parents of a young son, a boy they insure knows nothing of their lifestyle or business ventures.

As members of the organization move to take over and win their place at the table, Miguel must maneuver his way around them as often as he does the law. He does so with a smooth style, an ease, a coolness that reveals him to be more deadly an adversary than most would give him credit for.

Other plot lines? How about the plastic surgeon going through a nasty divorce who wants to divest himself from dealing drugs? All he needs to do is dispense with his last shipment and pay off what he owes. This leads to a hip hop record producer who uses the load to finance his dreams of making the big time. And he in turn connects with a DEA agent on the skids with the department after having lost a partner and being wounded by a drug dealer.....who works for Miguel. See how nicely these pieces all come together?

The story is believable and fascinating to watch. It's like seeing the strategies of a chess game made plain and understandable, feeling compelled to watch until the next move is played, and then waiting for the next and the next and the next. Which leaves you feeling a void once the show is over because it doesn't actually end! This was a series on NBC for a while that never seemed to draw in the ratings it deserved. Now we'll have to wait and see if they actually finish the story!

The last time this topic was given any intriguing attention was in the book by James Mills THE UNDERGROUND EMPIRE, which told the story of three individuals involved in the drug trade and where it took them. This show captures that feeling of being a part of the story and going behind the scenes. It makes for interesting viewing and dynamite television. Had it been given a chance to find it's core audience on a cable station, this show would have rivaled THE SOPRANOS for best crime family drama.",1205539200,2,2890,4.370577281191807

I think it's more comparable to the Sopranos and was action packed all through unlike the Soprano's that has the tendency to drag. Another reviewer complained about it not having a perfect ending but I don't think the producer intended to have just a season, unfortunately they didn't get an extension.

I did have a few grievences with the show.  First was the editing.  One show would end and it felt like a month has passed in the show.  The episode's were not connected very well, with a few exceptions, like great mini-series usually are.  Another grievence is how the show ended.  Everything seemed hurried, like the producer's suddenly realized that only 20 minutes of show was left and they needed a sudden conclusion.  The show did not tell what happened to side characters, like the doctor or the DEA agent, the script just left them in the dust. If you like the Godfather Part 1, you will realize that the ending of this show is a rip-off of the ending of a classic.  I would recommend watching this, but just don't expect too much.",1077753600,4,889,4.540880503144654
1882805,5,B00009AV85,"Hi there. It is so nice to read all of the reviews on our show KINGPIN. I was one of a bunch of people at Spelling Television in Los Angeles who developed and sold this show to NBC. Originally KINGPIN WAS intended to be a full fledged network series. The network got cold feet at the last minute, however, and ordered only 6 episodes telling us if it did well, they would order more and turn it into a series for the next year. Funny/sad thing happened. The network aired the series on Sunday nights AND on Monday (maybe it was Tues. can't remember now). The problem was NO ONE KNEW the second episode on Monday was a NEW episode. So no one watched the second episode. Over a three week period, NBC aired new episodes twice a week. EVEN PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD WORKING IN TELEVISION WERE CONFUSED. For the first time ever an NBC President admited it was his mistake for airing two original episodes in one week, admiting it was a mistake and confused viewers - even some at NBC not in charge of scheduling! So there yah go, the ratings for the second airing sucked and they didn't order it for a full series order. Also, it really was a tough sale to the advertisers and NBC just thought they'd play it safe and go with a safer sale. Remember, it's all about advertising dollars. A lot of companies didn't want to sponser KINGPIN based on it's Sapranos-esq. content. I also think the network wanted HUGE HUGE ratings, it did get high ratings on Sunday night -- but they wanted HUGE. I believe it came in #1 in total views and the demo of 18-49, but again they wanted HUGE.

 But I am SO thrilled it was released on DVD through NBC Studios and Spelling Television. I hope you all tell as many people as you can about it. We were/are very proud about it and were happy it took the Spelling Television brand to a new level (we were previously known for BEVERLY HILLS, 90210 and MELROSE PLACE, among other shows.

 Thanks so much and please drop me a line if you have any thoughts about this show, I will pass them along to series creator David Mills. Just put KINGPIN in the subject line.

1882806,5,B00009AV85,"1.  Kingpin was never meant to be a full-fledged network series - it was always meant to be a mini series.
2.  It is by far the BEST network mini series I have EVER seen. (note....this does not include any CABLE mini series)
3.  It was first aired by NBC and a few months later, cable network Bravo aired the series uncut.  I personally watched both airings before purchasing the DVD.  Excellent!
4.  There are three stories which are intertwined in one way or another (american doctor dealing with a hitman who works for a drug dealer who is being investigated by a couple of DEA agents of which one agent previously investigated the kingpin before her partner was killed)  More than three stories?  In theory, yes, but they all tie in to......the Kingpin.
5.  If you have not watched all episodes, please attempt to do so BEFORE posting a review.  An informed reviewer is the best reviewer.

I only wish that they didn't cancel the show it had a lot of potential for future episodes. But I am greatfull that they came out with it on DVD definitely a must buy.,1071360000,6,334,4.203125
