Just wish it was a single cut and not so many edits",1491696000,,76,3.5294117647058822
8708292,3,B00UU6X51A,"It's ok, but not very interesting compared to the actual Dolomites. It's mostly a fairly straight path through an alpine meadow and the sound track is not really related to what is being viewed on the screen.",1480982400,2,208,4.648648648648648

8708297,5,B00UU6X51A,"Beautiful scenery from a stream as it rushes over the rocks along its path to the pristine snow capping the majestic mountains. There are three 20 minute workouts with enough diversity to keep you wanting to walk to see where you'll go next.

 Realistic nature sounds from the rushing water to the chirping birds make you feel like you are actually walking and jogging in the mountains.

 I have found Tony Helsloot's dvds to be professionally filmed, colorful, diverse, easy to loop either as individual tracks or all together and always a great addition to any nature or exercise DVD collection.",1434758400,,597,4.881188118811881
8708298,5,B00UU6X51A,"This is a very peaceful and calming DVD.  I really enjoy the feeling of walking through the pretty countryside of the Italian Dolomites with fast-flowing rivers and streams, which emit pleasant gurgling sounds.

Part of the walk is on paths beside the rivers, and lush green trees and the famous Dolomite Mountains are visible over the woods.  The walk takes me past meadows with long grass and wild flowers, and there is also the glorious sight of a church or monastery perched high in the mountains.

I pass through picturesque local villages, which make me feel as if I am really visiting this lovely part of the world.  When coupled with the bird calls and various other sounds of nature, this enhances the restful sensations and makes my exercise session pass very quickly and happily.

Once again 'Nature DVD' have produced a superb DVD with stunning picture quality.",1429833600,2,873,4.864864864864865
8708299,5,B00UU6X51A,"This DVD is perfect for the treadmill and the great scenery and the beautiful colors of these images reminded me of past holidays I spent in Italy. Blue sky, bright green meadows and forests, and sometimes you can see the snowy Dolomites in the background. On this DVD, there are three different videos where you often pass by flowing streams and thereby you can enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature. You can hear birds, crickets or only the noise of the flowing water. Thus, the training is much more fun. I have tried the DVD already using the exercise bike, this also works really well. For anyone, who wants to combine holiday feeling and training together, then this DVD is perfect for you.",1429142400,,695,4.658536585365853
8708300,5,B00UU6X51A,"What I like about all these Virtual Walks / Cycle DVDs is that they are all so different (I have several from the same company).  I recently discovered that one can see a trailer of each of these DVDs on the filmmaker's website www.worldnaturevideo.com.  The ""Italian Dolomites"" walking DVD is new and I purchased it from their website, but am sure Amazon will have it in stock here soon.  These 3 walks are really nice, filmed in HD, with nature sounds, mostly following along the edge of a fast flowing river, surrounded by pine tree forest and gorgeous views of the snow capped mountains. You encounter only a handful of people along the way and some small hamlets here and there.  I use these DVDs for indoor cycling rather than walking or jogging and play my own music whilst riding, The 3 walks are about 20 minutes each, making it a full hour workout if you play all 3 continuously.  I think it would be a nice addition to these DVDs if the creators would add a picture of a map on the back cover of the DVD, indicating where these walking areas are located.  Maybe one day I can then visit these stunning locations.  DVD highly recommended!",1427846400,,1148,4.490384615384615
