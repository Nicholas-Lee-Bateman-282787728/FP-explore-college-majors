4833374,4,B005M1O5K8,I totally enjoyed this movie.  It was a great family show.  There was drama with very minimal violence; no swearing.,1329264000,19,116,4.75
4833375,2,B005M1O5K8,"A very good movie but I could him only play on my PC and not on my TV and that was not so nice,the next time I will buy a DVD I will send a message to the seller to ask him of I can play it in Europe or I could change it in the menu of the dvd.
For the rest the quality and the quick delivery was ok and in excellent condition,but now I've been warning,see twice before you buy a DVD.

4833382,5,B005M1O5K8,"Watching this episode on UpTV around 2012 led me to Heartland, which is a Canadian TV series. Because it is shown on the CBC Network, we in the States have had problems being able to find or watch current episodes (and must wait or find ways to view it). It is currently in its 11th Season.  I've purchased all years dvds because it is that good and is a keeper. Heartland Christmas was shown in Season 3, and is pivotal to a major plot in Season 8.  So...if you are or become a Heartland junkie or binge watcher, and haven't watched Heartland Christmas, curl up on the couch with a cup of hot chocolate and escape to the Canadian Rockies, the story of Ty and Amy, and enjoy. But beware, Heartland addiction is probable, and you must start at the beginning with Season One to get the full effect.",1513987200,7,796,4.3355704697986575

4833454,5,B005M1O5K8,"This Christmas special takes place in the middle of season 4 of ""Heartland"", however, it can just as easily be a stand alone movie. If you have seen the show before, you will have some insight into the characters history and their own nuances, but you can just as easily watch without having any idea that there even is a TV show. This is essential viewing for regular show viewers, as some of the characters and events from this movie will appear/be referred to in later seasons.

Anyway, this is a sweet story about a family and a community dealing with different struggles associated with the season and winter hardships. If you like horses, Alberta, or family dramedy, you will enjoy this film.",1481068800,6,698,4.67479674796748

Also as someone who has experience with horses myself, they did several things in the movie which really aren't accurate for taking care of horses. Horses will not die in the snow. It gets cheesy and unrealistic in parts. Its a Soap Opera mixed with Bonanza. But I like the series overall. The story line has not much to do with Christmas. It could have been better.",1419292800,,466,4.367816091954023

SOME LANGUAGE WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE AMY IS PROTRAYED AS
A ""HORSE WHISPER"" AND THAT PART IS EXCELLENT.  GRANDPA JACK
PUTS THE SPARK IN THE STORY BUT TOO MUCH LANGUAGE.  JUST HIS
BODY LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT HE NEEDED TO SAY FOR THE
STORY LINE.  I THINK THERE ARE ABOUT 7 SEASONS NOW OUT OF CANADA.

I love how they do everything as a family and a community and show the true meaning of Christmas. I think that all communities and families should have priorities and work together like this.

4833748,2,B005M1O5K8,I own the first three seasons of Heartland and have loved each and every episode. Since this is a Christmas episode I expected at least some reverence and reference to the fact that Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ. What I certainly DID NOT EXPECT is the use of God's name in vain. Had God's name in vain been used in any  of the first three episodes I would not have ordered any more and my avid following of Heartland would have ceased immediately. The use of God's name in vain was disgusted and disappointing as well as being a really despicable choice for it's creators.,1382918400,3,583,4.5

I anticipated this Christmas DVD to be equally stunning and have a great story line. Don't waste your money. I sent mine back. The story is set at Christmas-time but is more about Lou and Mallory fighting over decorations that anything to do with the Bartlett family Christmas. Everyone is out saving horses and helping another community. That part was fine for a series episode, but not for the Christmas special. I wanted decorations, family traditions, sleigh riding. Not Lou with ridiculous bangs, cat fighting and hardly a thing to do with Christmas. Definitely not what I was expecting.",1374796800,2,710,4.780487804878049

We found this series by accident on Netflix and became addicted to it.  Had to see the entire series which BTW, Neflix only offers seasons one and two.  This is an outstanding series for those of us who still enjoy family values, no violence, no blatant sexual content, no cursing and a feel good plot.  In other words, all ages can tune in and enjoy.  I highly recommend for those who are looking for programming the way it use to be and should be in my opinion.  It offers up, family, hard work, values, morals and guess what, the family sits down every night and has dinner together.  Yes, that does still exist; maybe only in the movies but I enjoy seeing it.",1334275200,240,778,4.475177304964539
