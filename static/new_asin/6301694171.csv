Having lost my young wife at the age of 32 to breast cancer, I found this movie very accurate in portraying the challenges faced by families where breast cancer has made its impact. It would be better if closed captioning were available.  Interestingly,Jill Clayburgh did, in fact, die of cancer and her portrayal of the wife in this movie is so true to life that it is hard for me to watch it without experiencing a flood of memories - good and bad. Tom Skerritt does an excellent job portraying the husband. This is a sad but uplifting movie.",1356307200,3,592,4.472222222222222

Soon after, Moira discovers her cancer has returned so she begins preparing anew, her husband, her teenage daughter Jani (Cyndy Preston), and her young son Brad (Andrew Bednarski) for when she is gone. Moira has an especially difficult time dealing with her daughter's denial, and the idea of her husband's happiness after she dies. She continues running her successful art gallery with friend and partner Cynthia (Rosemary Dunsmore) as she deals with the pain of the cancer's progression and the guilt of putting family and friends (Mimi Kuzyk) through an even worse hell than five years earlier. Moira's time is filled with joys and pitfalls as she endeavors to live to the fullest, the time she has remaining with the immortal words of poet Robert Frost looming over her""...The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep."" Outstanding performances by Jill Clayburgh (RIP), Tom Skerritt, and Cyndi Preston.",1289001600,3,1224,4.856459330143541
