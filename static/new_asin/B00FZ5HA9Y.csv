8619696,5,B00FZ5HA9Y,These videos are very well done. Everything explained very clearly and easy to follow. Tom is quite inspiring to watch. Not to mention the sash is so fun to use.,1488585600,,161,4.4
8619697,3,B00FZ5HA9Y,"I would rate the instructional material of this DVD five stars, Thomas Fazzio is very skilled and he does a great job of breaking down the how's and why's of what he is doing.

My issue is that the DVD itself needs to have chapters defined so that I can jump through the material easier.  Flashing back to 30 years ago when I had a tape drive on my computer, I've had to create a spreadsheet listing the chapters and their approximate start times so that I can go back to the pieces that I want to look over again.",1434067200,3,514,4.13
8619698,5,B00FZ5HA9Y,"Tom Fazio does a great job introducing chain whip and rope dart skills through his Art of Sash video.  (He has channel on YouTube under the name ""Thomas Fazio"".)  I recently got interested in Rope Darts, so I bought 3 DVDs, one was from Shi Diao, which shows more of the traditional Chinese rope dart techniques, and the other is from Donald Hyun Kiolbassa, which goes into step by step rope dart drills and routines.

The gap that this video fills is that it teaches the basic skills for the art of soft weapons through his teaching of the sash.  The sash is basically a strip of silk with a weight at the end (or you can make it double-weighted if need be).  You can convert his sash into a short sash by rolling it up in your hand to shorten the lengh, and then you can practice chain whip drills.  Unwind it in your hand, now it's the length of a long sash, and you can practice rope dart drills.  If you're wondering where you can buy his sash, he has a store online where you can buy it.  In fact, that's where I bought his DVD.

In the DVD, he gives his opinion on which drills/skills he thinks are practical and the purpose of each drill.  He also has the only DVD that mentions how you should practice with a spongy, soft ball (or a sack of gummy bears); I think this is great advice after practicing for a month.  When you see someone skilled practicing these drills, it's easy to think it's a rare occurrence that you'd get hit-- then you start practicing and know that's not the case at all.  I can't count the number of times of hit myself in the legs and head.  But once you get it, you don't hit yourself as often.

I see Fazio's video as a starter DVD, Donald Hyun's as the 2nd DVD to watch for rope dart routines, and Shi DeBiao's DVD as the 3rd more advanced DVD.

However, I didn't think that after practicing Tom Fazio's short sash (or chain whip) drills would make me realize how crucial it is to have chain whip skills first, before rope dart.  So now, my plan is to finish learning Tom Fazio's short sash drills, but then move onto a Chain Whip DVD after.  I wouldn't even thought about doing this if I hadn't seen his DVD... but it makes complete sense, as rope dart skills just build on top of chain whip skills (not to mention, it's said that chain whip is a precursor or taught simultaneously with rope dart).

Overall, I love his DVD; he has excellent instructions and emphasizes the importance of hip movement and footwork. I was sold on his DVD after watching some DVD excerpts on his YouTube channel.  He is a great teacher!

(PS  I have a YouTube channel, channel name is Xolette, in which I will post how I made my practice rope dart using rope, o-rings, screw eye, and a rubber ball very soon!)",1397174400,6,2728,4.2890625
