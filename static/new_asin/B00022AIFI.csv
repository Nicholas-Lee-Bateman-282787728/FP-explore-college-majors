8323503,5,B00022AIFI,I have done Fran's stretch video for years -- off and on.  When I am faithful to do it I have far less hip pain.  The emphasis in this video is for hip problems and I have found it marvelous.  Getting ready to buy my third copy.  I have literally worn the other two out!,1469491200,,270,3.8545454545454545
8323504,3,B00022AIFI,"This dvd went into a lot of lower body stretches especially for the hips, but only glosses over some arm stretches and nothing really for the chest and back. Trish doesn't tell you how long you should hold the stretches nor does she say if you should do all these stretches as one routine because she does a number of lower body stretches and the sheer number of lower body stretches seem far too much for one session. She doesn't really teach anything as far as breathing patterns are concerned while you stretch either. There's also no mention if you should repeat any stretches as well.",1110412800,5,589,4.566037735849057
8323505,5,B00022AIFI,"I found the Stretch This DVD to be a visual encyclopedia of stretches for all areas of the body.  In addition to being a well-guided stretching routine in and of itself, I feel I will always refer to this video for stretches for areas of the body I may want to focus on, or to research stretches that fit a particular need.  In Stretch This, Ms. Fischer, as she is with other workout videos I've bought through her Exterior Designs company, is meticulous and thorough.  She explains and demonstrates the technique of the stretches in a way that is easily understood, and that promotes proper technique.  Throughout the video, benefits of the stretches are explained.  For example, Ms. Fisher indicates that inadequate, or no, stretching of the calf muscles before running or walking, is a cause of shin splints.  Being a sufferer of shin splints over the last two years, this is information I had not found in my previous research efforts into the condition, or from my doctor.  I have to believe other buyers of the video will find similar unexpected nuggets of information like this, that will be valuable to them.  I recommend the Stretch This DVD.",1083715200,13,1151,4.748743718592965
