Film = barely three (3) stars; costume design = five (5) stars; cinematography and lighting = five (5) stars; restoration/preservation = five (5) stars; production design = four (4) stars; music = four (4) stars; subtitles = four (4) stars; continuity = two (2) stars.  Director Masahiro Shinoda (who is also credited as a script co-writer) constructs a very sad and tragic tale of the times (circa early 1900s) involving a lone goze (a blind female beggar/minstrel who wanders about singing and playing the shamisen) whose beauty and sex drive are her undoing.  The protagonist was abandoned as a child by her parents and raised in a goze commune run by strict women who provide local/regional musical entertainment for a living.  It is an organization not unlike geisha training houses of the era, but with a twist: having sex with males is forbidden on pain of expulsion.  This absolute rule makes sense, since goze are ripe for sexual exploitation because of their severe disability and run the risk of becoming short-lived prostitutes.  (Not surprisingly, there is a strong undercurrent of lesbianism in the group.)  Shinoda seems to be along for the ride (or as a tour guide?), since it is overly obvious where the painful plot is going and where things will end up once his leading lady (who happens to be his real-life wife) is tossed out of the commune for breaking (often, it seems) its cardinal rule and becomes a lone goze  (she later realizes the wisdom of this prime directive and tries to get back in, but no deal.  Acting is generally well directed except for the Director's wife (Shima Iwashita) who turns in a much too perky performance for such a tragic role.  She does, however, deliver lines that are strong statements and refreshingly straight forward (unlike the usual line-reading vagueness and overly-done posturing by lead actresses in contemporary films).  Costume design is stunning.  Cinematography (narrow screen format, color) and lighting (especially of exteriors) provide gorgeous shots (perhaps to underline what goze tragically can not see?), but chopped-off panoramas--the film ""cries out"" for a wide-screen format!  Continuity needs a re-edited re-think. The first half of the film is overloaded with flash backs/forwards rending the story line confusing rather than punching up an overly long movie that is sometimes borderline boring.  There are also continuity problems in the rest of the movie.  Production design is all-around very good.  Score uses a fair-sized orchestra with extremely effective orchestral arrangements .  Subtitles  are close enough.  A Toho programmer that is uniformally a real downer.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1516492800,,2839,5.234513274336283
