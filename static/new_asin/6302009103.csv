I had the incredible fortune of being forced to watch this movie multiple times as a child. (It seems my elementary school's health program had exactly one anti-drug movie.) Now the thumping rhythm of the Fate Elevator song transports me back to a simpler time in my life.

Ok, the movie. Where to begin?

First, there are some bad kids. A group of four. They do unrealistic things such as:
-acquiring ENORMOUS quantities of alcohol and marijuana (we're talking a full freezer-bag of weed)
-consuming all those substances relatively quickly
-openly doing drugs in the middle of a video store

The bad kids try to get our hero, Ben, to do drugs. Ben isn't so sure... then he meets Cosmo (just in time!), who is kind of like a guardian angel... except he throws Ben into horrifyingly dangerous situations with almost no explanation, and does not step in to save him at any point. Cosmo takes Ben to a world where drugs are personified as human beings -- a world that apparently hovers above our own world, as the only way to get there is via the Fate Elevator. Once in drug-land, a person must stay there until Cosmo has (somewhat arbitrarily) decided that they have learnt their lesson.

The personified drugs are:
-Booze (dirty, hobo-ish)
-Pot (cobwebby, accompanied by sitar music)
-Cocaine (pale, glittery, always giggling)
-Heroin (spiky-haired, apparently Wiccan)

We mostly get to know Booze and Pot. Cocaine and Heroin are the rare birds of drug-land, making their characters that much more mysterious and exciting. (I used to think Heroin was sort of attractive, too.) Unlike the two mysterious drugs, who don't do much harm at all to little Ben, Booze and Pot actively try to kill him. They throw him in a snake-pit, pull a chainsaw on him, try to roll a large barbell into his ankles, attempt to crush him between two walls, try to drop a weight on him... and so on.

Also, Booze and Pot sing. As does Cosmo. This movie is actually a musical! Songs include:
-""Take The Elevator Up"" sung by Cosmo, with help from Ben (you'll hear this jam thrice)
-""Gimme That Headband"" sung by B+P (not terribly melodic)
-""Reservation For One"" sung by B+P (my personal favorite!!)
-""Drug City"" sung by B+P (eerie)

Now, if you think that drug-land sounds too scary for poor Ben, rest assured he has some help. Cosmo gives him three gifts:
-A headband that lights up and recites a limited number of drug facts.
-A pair of glasses through which Been learns that, while the drug-addicts working out at the local bar-slash-gym may SEEM glamorous, they are, in actuality, wrinkly-faced and dusty-haired (thanks to drug use?). Interestingly, Ben trusts the images he sees through these glasses over his own senses.
-A pendant that gives Ben the courage to fight back against ""drug pushers"" (who literally push drugs all over Drug City), and to quote the Declaration of Independence nonsensically.

Ben makes three separate trips into drug-land, courtesy of Cosmo's Fate Elevator. Each time he returns, he tries to convince the four bad kids (remember them?) to realize the error of their ways. Will he be able to change their drug-addled minds? Or will he succumb to their patented 1980's Druggy Kid Peer Pressure? OR will Ben die a tragic, chainsaw-related death in drug-land, never to be found again?! And will my college roommate and I invent a game to play with this movie, wherein the players must take one drink of alcohol whenever the headband talks?

I'll leave to you discover the answers for yourself. But one thing is certain: if you are considering sampling drugs for the first time, watch this fine film first. You can also watch it during or after you've sampled them. Just make sure you watch it.",1273363200,4,3828,4.796661608497724

I love it.",1083283200,8,275,4.288461538461538
