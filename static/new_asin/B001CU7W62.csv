8289514,5,B001CU7W62,As the son of one of the Glidermen in this video I could not be prouder of my Dad and the men that flew in these Gliders to give us our freedom. Dad was very private about his WW2 time and I am glad he did this video so history will not forget their sacrifice. This is very accurate video of the Gligermen of the 325th div of the 82nd airborne.,1429574400,,344,3.859154929577465
