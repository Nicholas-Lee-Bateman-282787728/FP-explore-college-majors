6042247,5,B00FZJ1ZWI,I have invested in other Jeremiah Watt products and like in those other instances I was not the least bit disapointed. I only wish I would have had these products 20 years ago. Thank you very much.,1397779200,2,197,4.351351351351352
6042248,5,B00FZJ1ZWI,"This is a very comprehensive look at saddle making - I really like how Jeremiah goes into detail on some of the obscure points like ear cuts etc.

It was well worth the money.

8619751,5,B00FZJ1ZWI,"I love this dvd as it gave me exactly what I was looking for. Detailed information on designing and making a western saddle. From choosing proper parts of leather, making own patterns, new and easy ways of measuring center lines, proper detailed construction to hand sawing, polishing and finishing the leather, Jeremiah explains it all. And also why he does it the way he does it. I recommend to everyone, who would like to improve their skills of making saddles or even to riders to appreciate the saddle maker's hard work which is involved  by making the custom western saddle",1400716800,3,579,4.79
