8288826,5,B001CQZYKM,"The In-fisherman series of Bass Fishing CD's are the best teaching CD's out there.
They actually show what they are doing, they describe in detail what they are doing
and explain why the techniques work.  My husband is a seasoned  fisherman and these are
the only tapes he will watch over and over.  Well worth the money!",1424649600,,321,4.5964912280701755
