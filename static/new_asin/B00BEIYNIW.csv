5586979,4,B00BEIYNIW,"The Davidson family gets together for mom and dad's 35th reunion. The kids and their bf/gfs are there for what starts out a bit snarky at dinner, then sudden arrows start coming through the windows killing people. The slasher aspect gets up close and personal, as we try to figure out the motive of the slashers (not too hard from the few clues) as there are no other characters introduced. The killers hadn't planned on plucky Erin (Sharni Vinson) fighting back.

This is perhaps one of the better home break-in slasher movies I have seen in a while, which isn't saying much. A little horror, a little, drama, a little humor, a little mystery. Definitely worth a rental for fans of the genre.

5586980,2,B00BEIYNIW,"I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing from this movie, but they couldn't even seem to get the basics right.

The opening scene makes no sense whatsoever once you find out what the plot is.

The next half hour is just really boring banter between family members.

Any time something exciting is happening the camera starts violently shaking making it really annoying to watch.  Would sort of make sense for a handheld movie like Cloverfield but makes no sense when the rest of the movie is multi-cam.

Some things are forgotten about minutes after it happens.  A guy gets stabbed in the forearm and other guy gets stabbed in the back and both are fine in the very next scene.

Two stars because some of the deaths were cool and there were a few twists that were interesting but overall not worth going to the movies to see.  Rental at best.",1378166400,3,842,4.566666666666666
5586981,4,B00BEIYNIW,"This film, directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett, was originally released at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, but only recently became released in theaters in the United States. It's a little surprising it took so long, though, because ""You're Next"" is a tense, well-crafted horror film, one that is very refreshing among a myriad of cliche and annoying slasher films.

The film follows the Davison family, who have all gathered for their parents', Paul and Aubrey (Rob Moran and Barbara Crampton), anniversary. Their son Drake and his wife Kelly (Joe Swanberg and Margaret Laney), their son Felix and his girlfriend Zee (Nicholas Tucci and Wendy Glenn), their daughter Aimee and her boyfriend Tariq (Amy Seimetz and Ti West), and lastly their son Crispian and his girlfriend (and heroine) Erin (A.J. Bowen and Sharni Vinson). After all the family gathers, they are suddenly picked off one by one by three assailents wearing animal masks (played by Simon Barrett, Lane Hughes, and L.C. Holt). However, as the family reacts to this sudden disaster, Erin steps up to the plate and works to protect the family.

This movie may have a pretty typical set-up (isolated house in the middle of nowhere, dysfunctional group of people who share a close relationship), but it is more than just a typical slasher. It may not reach the heightened levels of horror as a movie such as ""Alien"" (one that contains not only suspense, but has excellent themes and a villain that contains just as much psychological horror as physical horror), but that doesn't belittle the excellent craft of this film. It is a truly suspenseful horror movie, one that contains the right pieces and execution to keep viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film. Subtle moments create suspenseful scenes and the messing with expectations keeps the movie from becoming predictable as well (this movie has some excellent uses of foreshadowing in it's Chekhov's Guns). This also combines with realistic portrayals of characters. Every character in this ensemble cast is believable, mainly because they all have different reactions to the events occurring. Erin knows how to handle the situation and steps up to the plate, making her a worthy addition to the likes of Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode as a capable (and even sexy) Final Girl, one who the viewers will always root for. However, all of the other characters react differently, often in ways that suit their character well, and each of these different reactions makes sense in context while also balancing out the plot well. All of the characters' decisions, both smart and dumb, help keep them all from being too one-sided. We can't have too much genre savvy (the film would be boring), just as we can't have every character constantly making stupid decisions (we wouldn't care for them if this was the case).

The production and direction is also excellent. There are some excellent shots throughout the film. The ""You're Next"" signs are excellently creepy and ominous, Erin gets some shots that definitely emphasize her and her actions, and there are even a few slow-motion moments that aren't used to terrible effect (some of these even help add to the disorientation). The deaths themselves are all unsettling and well-crafted. Some will utterly disturb the viewer, while others will do that while also bringing in just a touch of humor and fun (one particular death at the end caused laughter in the theater). This is definitely not a movie that has lost its gory touch, which a slasher movie never should, really, but it also doesn't build itself solely on gore, either. There's a nice balance between gore and suspense (and even with a sprinkle of humor mixed in). Lastly, the soundtrack is pretty good, providing some great tunes to fit the suspenseful or more action-oriented moods. One particular song used in the last half is catching and fun to listen to, while also complementing the situation Erin is in.

Overall, ""You're Next"" is a refreshing and enjoyable slasher film. It may not be one of the best, but it is still great, capturing all the right elements for a slasher movie without straying to the constant cliches of the genre. It is highly recommended to horror movie fans, and especially those who are jaded by many recent efforts.",1378080000,9,4324,4.96
5586982,5,B00BEIYNIW,"This is a movie that would make Quentin Tarantino s*** his pants with glee.  It is packed with twists, strong characters, and truly artful cinematic technique.  It eschews traditional horror film plotting, and does not shy away from expectations of gore and violence in its genre.  There is of course a generous amount of comic satire.  The film's only fault is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough.  It is such a magnum opus in the canon of home invasion slasher pictures that the punchline of an ending almost feels insufficient.  Think The Royal Tenenbaums crossed with Friday the 13th.

Adam Wingard's direction and editing here reveal true virtuoso film making.  He doesn't just create spooky moments, but has full poetic control of rising tension in the entire film.  He lingers in key moments of the film, emphasizing actor's expressions, portraying the action in excruciating detail.  The soundtrack carenes from a diegetic realism, using one song by Dwight Twilley, to a soundtrack with full on synthesizers in the films final scenes.  However you feel about horror, this is a guy who knows exactly what he's doing on every level, and the skill in this film's construction is undeniable.",1377907200,5,1204,5.03030303030303
5586983,3,B00BEIYNIW,"You're Next is directed by Adam Wingard, who is no stranger to the horror genre after his infamous shorts in both VHS films and The ABC'S of Death. We see a family getaway turn nightmare, when the Davison family become target by three masked killers. However, they did not anticipate one of the guests ready to put up a deadly fight....
The invasion of the `happy' home is recurring theme in horror, the originally of this film comes from the unsuspected survival element from one of the guests. The fact that You're Next is not about a paranormal occurrence is pretty much exciting in itself, but the widespread hype for this film and its national cinema release speaks volumes. The film relies heavily on the storyline and script to carry it through, which works to build the anticipation and suspense of each `kill', however a need to overcomplicate by offering an unnecessary explanation leaves this film feeling slightly flat.

The gore is plentiful, as it offers a showcase of particularly painful incidents and nasty ways to die. The inclusion of animal masks offers an `old school' horror element; of fear created from the simplest notion of hidden identity by dehumanising of the killers (`Don't bother locking the doors. Animals don't use doors'.)
You're Next offers a fun horror that is a descent addition to home invasion. A well put together feature that deserves to have its time in the theatres. With huge similarities to the Korean horror film `To Sir, With Love', there is no great originality to this film, but it does the job in conveying and creating fear, where everyone's safest place in the world becomes a house of horror.

5586984,5,B00BEIYNIW,Awesome horror film. Very realistic with great acting. I Will definitely be buying it when it is released on DVD.,1377302400,2,113,4.7
5586985,4,B00BEIYNIW,"Note:  This is a theatrical review and there may be spoilers.

In what continues to be a darn good year for horror films, add this Adam Wingard chiller to the list.  Those looking for a traditional home invasion slaughter-fest should be satisfied but really that's being somewhat myopic.

Wingard invites several of his director/writer/producer buddies to have significant roles in the film.  Most prominent is Joe Swanberg as Drake, one of 4 siblings invited, along with their significant others, to their wealthy parents second home for their 35th wedding anniversary.  Along with Drake and girlfriend Kelly (Margaret Laney) are brothers Crispian (AJ Bowen), a college professor and his former student now girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson), and Felix (Nicholas Tucci) and his goth-girl Zee (Wendy Glenn).  There is one sister, Aimee (Amy Seimetz) and boyfriend Tariq (horror filmmaker Ti West).

You don't have to wait around long for things to get interesting.  We see a couple neighbors ""down the road"" get wacked for no apparent reason.  Maybe practice.  The home invaders all wear animal masks, for reasons not clear for most of the film.  Family and friends begins to drop one by one with a variety of unusual weapons.  No guns around which is ironic as the father, Paul (Rob Moran) is a retired defense contractor.

The emotional reactions seem to be mostly screaming hysterically or in dazed confusion.  Erin, for reasons explained midway through the film, isn't one to sit around and wait to be executed however.  Using some ingrained Australian survival skills and common smarts, she refuses to be a victim.  There are some interesting twists that make this film different from most of its ilk.  Think about all those horror/thriller styled movies where the bad guy is put down, but you just know that one little old bullet or one little blow to the head isn't going to keep him from rising and attacking again.  Erin leaves no question as she turns the tables on the antagonists.

If you have time to catch your breath, you will have to ask the question why, and most experience film-goers will figure it out, but that only increases the fun factor.  If the film has a weakness it is that some of the acting is a bit hammy and contrived.  But like all good films of this genre, there is also a goodly dose of dark humor.  In one scene one couple debate the idea of have sex in a bed occupied by the corpse of a close family member.  Hey, I said it was dark humor.  This is an above average horror film.  Think ""Home Alone"" meets ""High Tension."" I wasn't disappointed.",1377302400,39,2577,4.773755656108597
5586986,3,B00BEIYNIW,"Horrible filmmaking...but being unexpectedly complemented by one of the best credibly tough horror heroines in the last decade makes it all worth it.

Directed by Adam Wingard (V/H/S 2: Phase I Clinical Trials, V/H/S: Tape 56, The ABCs of Death: Q is for Quack) and written by Simon Barrett (V/H/S 2: Tape 49 and Phase I Clinical Trials, V/H/S: Tape 56 and Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger, The ABCs of Death: Q is for Quack), this movie failed in most respects except for excellently presenting a credibly tough female survivor character.  This is difficult to do without getting carried away, and it should be acknowledged that this is major.  However, despite their ability to entertain me with some of their short films, as filmmakers they failed me here.  I was entertained and this wasn't a bad movie experience for me, but it was all because one well-crafted character saved this movie for me.

THE PLAYERS:  Parents Paul and Aubrey (Barbara Crampton; Re-Animator, Chopping Mall, From Beyond) are celebrating their 35th anniversary at their secluded house with their children Crispin and his girlfriend and the savior of this movie Erin (Sharni Vinson; Step Up 3D); Drake (Joe Swanberg; Cabin Fever 2, V/H/S) and his wife Kelly; Felix and his new girlfriend Zee; and daughter Amy  and her boyfriend Tariq (director Ti West; The Innkeepers, Cabin Fever 2).

This movie approaches Vacancy and The Strangers but changes the victims from a couple to a family of ten.  Otherwise, quite similarly, the location is remote, contact to the outside world is cut off, and we don't know why our killers are trying to kill them (for a while anyway).  This premise should have the ability to be very exciting, but your thrills will be serially curbed  by the break in tempo you'll endure when you are forced to watch the characters interact with one another.

Yup...it's sad. The characters are terribly written and their choices and issues seem dumb even for a horror movie--even when you consider that they're irrational and scared for their lives.  The one exception is thankfully a glowing one: Erin.  Sharni Vinson does an AMAZING job in this role!  Erin is a strong-willed woman who makes believably smart choices while remaining appropriately scared.  She maintains just enough control, avoids life-ending idiotic decisions, and when she's fighting for her life she does it credibly whether she's striking someone by surprise in the throat or recklessly jumping out a window to escape a killer.  She's never depicted as unrealistically strong, tough, invulnerable, ninja-like or brilliant.  What's great is that, however unlikely, they even provide us with a reason that she can handle herself so well under duress.

Like our heroine from I Spit on Your Grave (2010), Erin goes through Hell, gets considerably hurt and accumulates several debilitating injuries, and finds most of her strength in her desperation and anger with her situation.  The major difference between the two is that nothing horrible happened to Erin for her to seek revenge.  Instead, some folks just starting killing everyone at a dinner party and she reacted in kind.

The story was unoriginal, incredibly simple, and yielded a plot twist which I think you'll be expecting before they finally get around to the big reveal.  The blood, screaming, lacerations and impalements were abundant and, if you could get over the poorly written bonkers randomness of it all, there were some thrills to be had, though mostly thanks to Erin-fueled adrenaline!",1377216000,,3542,5.048109965635739
5586987,4,B00BEIYNIW,"A family gets together after many years and everyone begins arguing at dinner when all hell breaks loose from some outside intruders. That is pretty much the simple setup.

While You're Next is far from original, it does many things right. You care about some of the characters a little more than the average slasher film and the female lead is really smart for a change. Finally an intelligent and tough person to root for instead of yelling at them for doing every idiotic thing in the book. Plenty of gore, solid thrills and even a decent twist or two makes this horror film an enjoyable if somewhat familiar take on home invasion terror.

It's also worth mentioning that this film was suppose to be released years ago after much buzz, but something happened with the studios and they shelved it until now.",1377216000,,809,4.65034965034965
5586988,4,B00BEIYNIW,"You're Next (Adam Wingard, 2013)

I have not been much of a fan of Adam Wingard's recent work. A Horrible Way to Die showed potential but never realized it, and Wingard's contribution to V/H/S (the frame story) was the weakest of the bunch. But I keep giving him chances because his first feature, Home Sick, blew my head off in the best of ways. I know it's a pretty horrible thing to say, but I keep watching Adam Wingard movies because I keep waiting for him to make another Home Sick. And you know what? You're Next, which as I write this has a very surprising 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (the ""I hate everything horror"" critics haven't weighed in yet, I guess), is almost, but not quite, the movie I have been waiting for Adam Wingard to make for the past six years.

Plot: Paul (There's Something About Mary's Rob Moran) and Aubrey (Re-Animator's Barbara Crampton in a very welcome return to horror cinema) are celebrating their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary at the new family vacation home out in the middle of nowhere, and they've invited all of their children out to celebrate--there's Crispin (The House of the Devil's A. J. Bowen) and his girlfriend Erin (Step Up 3D's Sharni Vinson); Drake (V/H/S' Joe Swanberg, who recently stepped behind the camera to direct the highly-touted Drinking Buddies, coming out a couple of weeks after I'm writing this review) and his wife Kelly (Spider Man 3's Margaret Laney, for some reason credited here as Sarah Myers); Felix (Choose's Nicholas Tucci) and his new girlfriend Zee (11-11-11's Wendy Glenn); and the prodigal daughter, Amy (Wristcutters: A Love Story's Amy Seimetz) and her boyfriend Tariq (Ti West, a director in his own right, but appears in front of the camera on occasion, usually in films by either Wingard or Swanberg). All is going about as well as can be expected given that the siblings all pretty much hate one another, but thanks to the opening sequence, we are all too aware that a trio of masked killers (Home Sick's L. C. Holt, A Horrible Way to Die's Simon Barrett--who wrote this script, and who was also responsible for one of the best DTV movies of the past decade, 2004's Deadbirds, and Lane Hughes, who has appeared in every Wingard film since 2007's Pop Skull) are in the woods, watching and waiting for a chance to strike...

It sounds tired, and if you go into it expecting yet another home invasion movie (though let's be honest, the bar for those is still pretty high--Funny Games, Ils, The Strangers, etc.), the first thirty minutes of this flick will do nothing to disabuse you of that, though the comedic aspect that made Home Sick such a treat but has been missing from Wingard's work since is back in full force. But things start getting derailed in the best of ways after that, and before long you realize this is not at all the movie you thought you were paying to see. Don't get me wrong, it's still a home invasion movie, but it's as much a comedy as it is a survival thriller; it owes just as much to Peter Jackson as it does to Michael Haneke (especially in one scene that had the sold-out theater in stitches about fifteen minutes from the end of the movie). It's funny, it's perfectly-paced, the acting is fantastic, the soundtrack even better (especially in the last half-hour, when composers Max Heldtberg (Excision), Jasper Justice Lee (a longtime collaborator of Wingard's), and  Kyle McKinnon (The Mountain, the River, and the Road) drop the horror movie ambient-music clich&eacute; and just start paying homage to Goblin, which understandably brought whoops of joy from the audience I saw it with. In other words, it's bloody fantastic, a fun, fun thrill ride I can't recommend highly enough...

...save one problem, and that one problem is more than enough to balance out a lot of the movie's strong points (though I suspect this will have less of an effect on the small screen). The movie isn't filmed in shakycam, exactly. Let's call it unSteadicam, instead. And to put it mildly, I haven't been this motion-sick in a movie since The Blair Witch Project (and I've seen a lot of shakycam stuff on the big screen; Cloverfield, for example, was not a problem for me at all). I couldn't watch about half of the movie with my eyes open wider than slits for fear of tossing my vastly overpriced popcorn back into its receptacle in a half-digested state. (And oh god, horror directors, can you please stop with the damn blinkies? That repeated-camera-flash scene was an instant headache generator.) If you're planning on going, and despite the awfulness of the filming method, I do suggest you take this one in, because it does have many strong points, take some Dramamine half an hour before showtime. Or wait for it to show up on Netflix or DVD; translation to the small screen may mitigate the motion-sickness effect. So in short, I'm recommending it as enthusiastically as I can given the reservations in this paragraph; those who are weak of stomach (or who suffer inner-ear disorders) will need to avoid it on the big screen, but everyone else should be okay given girded loins and motion-sickness pills. *** ",1376006400,6,5120,4.747191011235955

The Davisons are as messed up as they come. So when they all drive up to 5 Edelweiss Drive, Emporia County for a family reunion, bound to be some airing out of dirty laundry. The toxicity extends to the dinner table as further pent-up grievances are exposed. None in that room will ever admit it - mostly because most of 'em are horribly dead now - but the speeding arrow what shatters the glass window may have come as a relief, even if the shaft's buried itself in a family guest's forehead.

It's sad that not enough know about this rad movie. You're Next is a home invasion slasher film from 2013. It's a by-the-numbers horrorfest: masked assailants armed with stabbing/mauling/garroting tools picking off their stupid victims one by one. I was really okay with the Davisons and guests getting butchered in gristly fashion, for they are aggravating, panicky people. Mewling, whimpering no-hopers. And if that were all to the movie, I would've unhesitatingly consigned it to crap cinema purgatory. You're Next, however, has one shining saving grace. And that's Erin.

Oh the luck of chubby-faced Crispian Davison (A.J. Bowen) to snag a hot Australian bartending babe like Erin (Sharni Vinson). When sh-- goes down, Erin is the only one to not lose her sh--. Maybe if the studio had showcased her as a badass chick while promoting the movie, it would've raked in more than $26 million at the box office. There is a list for everything under the sun, including many lists for badass women in horror. Click on any of them and you'll see Erin prominently there, rubbing elbows with Ripley and Buffy and Clarice Starling and Barbara from Night of the Living Dead (but the 1990 version; the 1968 Barbra is pretty useless).

Sharni Vinson submits an unflinching portrayal of a survivor who will absolutely get her hands dirty. Them home invaders couldn't have picked a wronger person to stalk. Erin, come to find, is a survivalist, tough as nails and adept in the art of the creative ambush. Maybe the most fun part of the movie is when the perspective abruptly shifts and, suddenly, we're tracking the killers as they nervously creep thru the house, now terrorized by Erin. What a shockingly awesome turn of events.

By the way, I'm so relieved that the killers, in repeatedly scribbling ""You're Next"" on walls with their victims' blood, kept faith with grammar. I would've thrown the remote at the tube if the thing had read ""Your Next."" Because what's worse than an uneducated serial killer?

If nothing else, this movie drops several survival tips that may save your life: i.e.: the wooden planks with the nails sticking out and that, at some places, if you text 911, the police receive it as a voice mail.

I said this was a ""by-the-numbers horrorfest."" Maybe I take that back. There is some insidious black humor that pops up when you least expect it. Reportedly, some of the intense dialogue over the dinner table is improvised material. The soundtrack and cinematography are top notch and substantially ramp up the tension. Regarding the ambient score, there is some ill John Carpenter stuff going on. We're treated to a string of creative kills, courtesy of Erin as she turns the table and proceeds to graphically Home Alone the interlopers. Erin is justice for the no-hopers, payback for scads of horror movies in which people laid down and meekly said, ""Stab me, psycho.""",1505779200,3,3394,4.831325301204819

The gore fx are well done, some of the kill scenes are just brutal & the cast isn't bad either but no one really stands out. There is a twist that some may see coming. It was an entertaining film for what it was but I just didn't find anything truly stand out about it.

The first 2/3rds of the movie is a stock home invasion flick where the cast goes out of their way to make the worst decisions possible at every turn. Then most of them die (because they're stupid) and it turns into an R-rated Home Alone flick with some interesting situations and character moments.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat, rooting for an underdog, gore, jump scares, and twists - although the second time through had me wondering how I didn't guess some of them.

5588030,1,B00BEIYNIW,"This movie is bad. It's not entertaining in the least.

I know some people will think I'm bashing it because I have the wrong mindset or something like that. But I don't. This movie is mistaken as a Horror movie when it's actually a horror/comedy. The problem with it though is that it fails at being both.

Actually, I take that back. This movie is funny at some moments, those moments being any time someone opens their mouth. The acting in this movie is atrocious. I was laughing at how cringe worthy it was. It's actually very comparable to Birdemic in acting ability and character presentation.

The premise is also cliche, over done, paper thin, and boring. I've seen this done before literally 20 times before, all of them 20 times better than this pile of garbage.

The cinematography is bland and uninspired. The presentation of the movie itself however... Is also bland and uninspired. There is not a single moment in this movie that sticks out to me.

And also this movie has a strong female lead for the sake of having a strong female lead. Now, I'm not against the idea of strong female leads, but they've been done so many times over in the past decade and a half that it's really boring to see on screen now. Plus, her character is never fleshed out in the story to actually care or root for her, so when she starts killing the people that are trying to kill her, I sympathized with the killers because they are the only ones that don't want to make you puncture your eyeballs out. AND HOW THE HELL CAN THE MAIN CHARACTER DO ALL OF THIS CRAZY FIGHTING! THEY NEVER EXPLAIN HOW SHE CAN DO IT, ONLY THAT SHE LEARNED IT SOMEWHERE IN THE PAST! IT'S BULLS***! IT'S NOT GOOD STORYTELLING, JUST A LAZY PLOT DEVICE.

And that's the word that I'd use to describe this movie: Lazy. In fact, the characters on screen look bored in every scene they're in, even the people who have masks on. They all look uninterested in what they're filming, and you can obviously tell that they're just collecting a paycheck.

Overall, this movie is s***. Don't buy or watch this. Go see It Follows instead, as it is an amazing movie that does not get as much recognition as it should. It's better than and more underrated than You'Re Next, and it deserves your attention more that this heap of trash.",1460764800,,2288,4.485576923076923

5588131,3,B00BEIYNIW,"Really 3.5 Stars -- maybe even 3.75 Stars. Just some comments here, not a review: This film is very engaging, as the viewer does not know why this mayhem is occurring until toward the end of the film. The background music/sound is very effective in moving the horror along. The acting is adequate, and mostly does not detract. The goth girlfriend, I thought, was a little over-the-top in her purposeful ""gothy"" attitude. (Nobody would really act so self-absorbed at a private intimate anniversary party for the wealthy parents of your boyfriend.) But, letting that go, we can still get absorbed into the home-invasion terror.

You can't think too carefully about the specifics of the action, though, because some specifics are just too ridiculous if you really ponder them:

1) First, the animal masks are good for being ""creepy"" in a movie, but they are the worst idea in the world if you are a ""professional home invader"". The inability to see out of these plastic masks with small eye holes is definitely a problem that would be readily apparent to the wearer, especially if the wearer is trying to commit murder. So, yes, a really dumb idea, but we'll have to just ""go with it"".
2) The invaders are firing arrows through the windows at the start of the invasion. But, the occupants seem to not be bothered by this recent activity, and continue to walk in front of windows, peer out of windows, opening the front door, etc. WHY?
3) Trying to run out the front door to get help? Why would anyone think that was a good idea? They are firing arrows at the house from the outside! Not a well thought out plan, and it fails.
4) There is a home invader in the house, upstairs where the mother was killed. Why are the family members not more pro-active at getting this guy out of there? Why are they walking around downstairs like everything is OK in the house? And, why isn't everybody carrying at least a knife or club for protection?
5) The neighbors who are killed at the beginning: not clear why this was done. Sure, the invaders don't want any witnesses around. But, how would they even have known that the neighbor (who is never home) was going to be there?  Not likely, but we can let this go.
6) The killers were apparently veterans of the armed forces. But, they seemed particularly inept at killing these unarmed people. And, why use bow and arrows? (I know it's good for  movie horror, but, as a practical matter, it's a ridiculous idea.)
7) The out-loud discussion of the motive for the killings (with ""our hero"" hiding inside the house) seems a bit contrived.

Even with all these plot failures, it still moves along and provides a ""horror experience"" -- but you know it could have been done better.",1457827200,,2709,4.600414078674948
5588132,4,B00BEIYNIW,"Watched this while housesitting and learned several helpful ways to set traps for bad guys. Afterwards I played my new favorite game ""lock all the doors and windows"". Must watch for housesitters, it'll feed their safety paranoia... or make them quit if they don't feel up to it. I sleep with a hammer beside my bed now. While all that is totally true, I found the film to be involving and didn't get bored. I initially put it on, thinking ""if I get bored after half an hour, I'll find something else to watch."" I was glued to the TV the whole time. There were several... creative deaths, and some funny/ridiculous moments, most notably a conversation about a dead mom. Good pulp splatter / home invasion movie where a bunch of dumb yuppie adults bite the dust. Love the bad guys' masks.

Reminded me of ""A Perfect Getaway"", which is more thriller than horror. If you like this movie, you might want to check that one out too.",1457827200,,925,4.505952380952381

Still, I couldn't wait for ""You're Next"" to go to video. This old school style movie had some good scares and some of the characters you feel sorry for and the rest you enjoy watching them get theirs. There is nothing creepier than the killer(s) in white masks popping up all over the place, perhaps a salute to ""Halloween"". Some of the family bickering is funny which gives this movie some needed humor but you have to listen for it. Good twist near the end and a somewhat different finish than usual. Overall, I love old school horror, even when it's modern and has production values like this one. If you do, you should watch ""You're Next"".",1455580800,2,773,4.4125874125874125

5588758,4,B00BEIYNIW,"Home invasion movies are my personal creepout. We all have our button and this particular genre is mine.

The boogety-boogeties in ""You're Next"" are terrifyingly metaphored in their eyeless animal masks, but not supernatural. They have motive. They have means. They are formidable without being invincible.

The logic of this movie ""plays fair.""

The protagonists of ""You're Next"" are neither ineffectual trip-at-the-last-minute, throw-perfectly-good-gun-at-villian-who-merely-drops-to-a-knee-after-being-shot-in-the-shoulder (I'm looking at YOU, Jennifer Lopez in ""The Boy Next Door""), nor are they John McClain.

Again, ""You're Next"" respects the viewer and plays fair.

My only ding is a couple of instances of ""Scooby-Do""ing: ""I'm going in this part of the scary house by myself. You go to that part of the scary house by yourself and we'll meet back here in a few minutes."" Yeah. You do that, Copernicus. Say hello to Darwin for me.

The gore is doled out judiciously and for-effect only. Some of the trope-y characters you want to hate are not missed when they meet their maker. Some of the trope-y characters you want to hate turn out to have more dimensions than you gave the writers credit for.

1. Jump factor
2. Backstory/motivating factor
3. A meaningful ending
The best jump factor portion of the movie was in the beginning, which is a logical format, and portrayed the chaos that was breaking loose in the house. Upon meeting the family, it is easy to tell that there are a few stereotypical horror movie characters, but the movie doesn't focus much time on developing those characters, instead ramping up the action and developing the more important characters.
Throughout the movie, we discover that the murders aren't just a random, blood-thirsty cult on a killing spree, but have motivating factors other than bloodshed and death (which I won't tell; no spoilers here!).
The ending of the movie was explosive as reality barges its way into the nightmarish, bloody mess. It left me grasping for that last piece of sanity in the situation, and didn't disappoint me.

5589083,5,B00BEIYNIW,"Trying not to give away this movie, I will share what I can about it.  A reunion of the parents, all the brothers, sisters and there spouses starts out great until some intrudes wearing masks start killing the family off one at a time.  But why are they doing this?  It isn't a robbery and it isn't just a random killing.  Someone in the family has there eyes on the family fortune.  But then someone in the group comes to the rescue and kicks the intruders butt.  If I say much more it might give away the movie so if you want to see what and who is doing all of this and why, then you need to see the movie.

Personally I loved it.  It's full of action with a surprise twist at the end that always make a movie exciting to watch.",1441843200,,731,4.027777777777778

not doing so becomes a fatal mistake.
The Davidson family and partners have a get-together, during a lively
debate at the dinner table, arrows start flying through the window.
A gang wearing animal masks are about to join the gathering leading to
a frenzy of blood-letting.
One by one the occupants meet a bloody end, Who's Next ?
Will anyone survive this night ?
Only one of the occupants have the courage to fight back.
Not everything is as straight forward as it seems however.
For me, very little in the way of tension, no real jump out of your skin
moments, somewhat predictable......however there certainly is plenty of
gore.....on the plus side, maybe a little sinister, and pretty graphic,
may make you cringe once in a while, but, nothing unexpected however.
In truth, it fell short of expectations......not, terrifying, though it does have
a bit of a twist in it's tail.
(Maybe there are too many movies like this around these days....no real
surprises to be had)
Predictable perhaps.

5589409,5,B00BEIYNIW,"The story is tight and unwinds smoothly allowing for an intense thrill ride. At first I thought it was going to be one of those slow building horror film's that ends in one twisted, violent displays of violence but ""You're Next"" keeps a pretty chilling, steady pace of non-stop suspense that had me on edge. I have never enjoyed cursing at the people on the screen as I did with this film. I never really noticed any moments where the story became stagnant. Even after the mid-film reveal as to the plot I still found the remaining section of ""You're Next"" just as thrilling as the first half.

As for the special effects and soundtrack of ""You're Next"", I found them equally entertaining and quite strong for an indie horror film. The gore and violent action scenes were strong and bloody. I cringed at how the kill sequence would play out and yet I couldn't wait to see it happen. The violence wasn't over-the-top or gratuitous-at least not for my taste. The film actually gave me the same level of pleasure I get from the classic horror films like ""The Burning"" and the original ""I Spit On Your Grave"".

The crowd was great and really responded well to the suspensful plot that Mr. Simon Barrett had written in his script. The mixture of home invasion and survival horror really got your heart bumping and with lead actress Sharni Vinson you had a heroine to root and cheer for. It was also great to see the beautiful as ever Barbara Cramton up there on the silver screen. When action took place it was quite bloody.

5589483,3,B00BEIYNIW,"Well done, good acting, but highly predictable.  You don't like any of the characters, (you'll actually dislike them), except the Australian chick and that's good since what you expect to happen in a flick like this does happen.  Even the ending is predictable  at least I saw it coming.  This movies shows that adults caught in slasher films make some of the same stupid decisions that partying teens do.  There are guys outside shooting us with crossbows.  Let's run outside.  Really?  They kind of let the cat out of the bag a little early which took the mystery (who's doing this and why) out of the movie.  The only small twist I didn't see coming (and should have seen coming) came near the end of the movie.  I will say this though, the blender was pretty creative.  I'll give it an extra star for that.

As one of the those who saw it at Fantastic Fest a few years before it finally found it's way into theaters 2 years later... glad I hyped it up FAR TOO MUCH just like any other horror fan would or should have.  Everyone's hammered, they're giving out kickass fox/lamb/lion masks, and it's a slasher movie with a great score, a sick sense of humor, and a real final girl.  Sadly, it didn't reinvent the wheel or save horror like that drunken crowd and I thought it would.

But it's still awesome.  Not as good as The Guest, more fun but less effective than A Horrible Way to Die, and much better than V/H/S.  The director didn't do either of the kickass short films or even the best part of the first one(though brought a sense of humor and much needed joyful apathy to the ABCS of Death with the letter Q.)

5590013,4,B00BEIYNIW,"It's easy to get jaded if you're a fan of horror films.  We've seen it all before: Slasher kills girl's family, girl meets slasher, slasher dies only to be resurrected in a sequel. ""You're Next"" is a refreshing twist on the tired slasher tropes.

The first sign that ""You're Next"" is different is in how director Adam Wingard treats his characters. Five minutes in, we are invited to judge a relationship without understanding what's going on: an older man and a much younger woman having sex.  That early scene communicates volumes. Our camera perspective peering into the bedroom makes their lovemaking look more like violence. The girl is clearly unsatisfied. Padding out of the room while her lover takes a shower, she sets up a five-disc CD player of music on repeat that will be integral to the rest of the film. Then she dies.

As our protagonists enter the next scene, driving up to a house nearby ad offhandedly explaining that the double homicide we just witnessed was a professor who left his wife for a college student. Do we feel better about their deaths as a result of their moral transgressions? While that question bounces around, we discover that our protagonists Crispian (A.J. Bowen) and Erin (Sharni Vinson) are in a similar relationship.  Do they deserve to die too?

The rest of the film is a running battle between three men in masks wielding crossbows and a WASPy family reunion gone sour.  Erin and Crispian don't know each other that well, and the film cleverly juxtaposes the horrors of navigating a boyfriend's family with a slasher film. There's the frail mother, the overbearing father, the little sister who battles for attention, and the bullying older brother who is jealous of everyone else's happiness.  All of these family members come with their respective spouses, who are equally clueless and disengaged.  All the non-family members (Erin included) also look curiously fake -- Erin and Zee (Wendy Glenn) look like they're wearing wigs. In ""You're Next"" the killers aren't the only ones wearing masks.

As the assault progresses, we get an explanation for why the bad guys do what they do, and ""You're Next"" gleefully wallows in the utter depravity of its villains. It throws the sins of the family in stark relief -- they're bad, but they're not murderers. Or are they?

Erin certainly is. In a refreshing twist, we discover that Erin is no shrinking violet. She uses survival tactics worthy of any prepper compound.  There's something viscerally satisfying about her increasingly ferocious counterattack as each character's morals (or lack thereof) are brutally unmasked.

""You're Next"" is filled with plot holes in service to the genre. Nobody seems to have any guns. The killers can barely see thanks to their ridiculous masks and they refuse to take them off when anonymity is no longer an issue. And the murder plot is flimsy at best. But ""You're Next"" isn't about realism.  It's about really, really hating your family. If you can't find the humor in that, this movie may not be right for you.",1424649600,5,3039,4.88715953307393

5590294,1,B00BEIYNIW,"Adam Wingard's follow up to this movie 'The Guest' is an instant cult classic. I loved it. I cant say the same about this film. In fact, other than the use of dark synth music, Im surprised it was made by the same director. 'You're Next' is awful. Truly awful.

Unlike 'The Guest' this movie takes itself too seriously. And here in lies the distraction. Everything these people do is completely implausible.
Implausible to the magnitude that it can not be viewed in all good conscience. Lets point out just some of these ludicrous situations.

- Arrows come darting into the house.. how on earth does a father bring himself to allow his daughter to run outside to get help. Having no idea what's going on outside. You can do it honey!

- Mother is upset. Time out for mom! Lets put her to sleep upstairs. Oh yeh. There are people trying to kill you. People that at this point could very well be in the house, upstairs, climbed the balcony. And we're going to take a time out and take mom upstairs to rest alone? WTFF. I mean how am I suppose to continue watching this movie at this point?

- So about 5 minutes ago arrows were firing through the window, and our protagonist is leisurely sticking her head out as she closes the remaining windows in the bathroom. Someone grabs her. She breaks free. The intruder disappears. And what does our female hero do. She leans out the window to see where the intruder went. I repeat. 5 minutes ago. THERE WERE FRIGGIN arrows being fired through the window. oh and 5 seconds ago someone grabbed her in a headlock through that very window. Oh but please. Dont mind the audience. Put your head out close to the window again.

- And still it seems to escape this family that an intruder has just killed mum upstairs AND SOMEONE IS IN THE HOUSE. Yet they leisurely walk from room to room. Mom got killed in her bedroom, and everyone runs back downstairs. Except her daughter in law. Her daughter in law is upstairs alone putting a bed sheet over mom and generally just feeling sad. I repeat mum just died a few seconds ago. SOMEONE IS IN THE HOUSE. why are you standing there alone in the bedroom.

I could keep going on.

Its rubbish. It was truly rubbish.

This film is a brilliant example of how the slightest changes in tone and wit can really make the difference between genius and stupid.

Im still ok this film was made, as it allowed the director to make these important adjustments in his sequel. 'The Guest' is genius.",1418860800,11,2463,4.455555555555556

The film happily departs from the usual Slasher Flick formula where the virginal survivor girl relies mostly on her wits to escape the grasp of the killer within a hair's breadth. This is not so with the fantastically portrayed, plucky heroine in THIS film. Her relationship with one of the family's brothers doesn't seem to cloud her judgement or impair the myriad of survival skills she possesses, acquired from years of training (information she withholds from her significant other...giggles). Because slasher fans always wait impatiently for the next killer kill, viewers will be giddy to know that, yet again, another trope is charmingly flipped on its head in this jewel of a film.

If you go into the movie expecting a scary movie you will be disappointed, but if you go in expecting a thriller it is an enjoyable film.  It is clearly a European film as the current crop of domestic films have degenerated to point where they all just rehash the same themes over and over.

This was not meant to be Strangers, it is poking at the depravity of people and that is as far as I can go with that statement, but you will understand after watching it. Actually it had more action than most action flicks too. I just can't believe the eighties Escape from New York soundtrack and steak sauce blood didn't tip people off that this was a comedy, and that is too bad, because if you go into it knowing this it is a hilarious thrill ride you won't soon forget.",1413763200,,745,4.216783216783217

Even Ray Charles could have seen that the brothers and girl-friend were in on it! The scorned wife was a cross of Macgiver and Steven Seagal. There was no build up or explanation as to why the hell the ""intruders"" would go in on this planned charade in the first place. And a blender blade in the guy's head? Really?

5590957,4,B00BEIYNIW,"The trailers for the movie were good, but they in no way did justice to the intensity of the flick. The horror in this movie is two-fold - gore and suspense. It's got hints of a slasher flick with plenty of gore, but more exciting is waiting for who's next. Now, the real genius in this movie is that, every time you think you have it all figured out, something else happens and you're thrown off, so it keeps you guessing the whole way through. As a writer and somewhat of a horror movie buff, it's hard to surprise me, but I NEVER saw the actual end coming until it literally slapped me in the face. In fact, I was so impressed that I laughed out loud at the end from sheer shock and utter respect.

We wouldn't have picked this flick had I known there'd only be one crossbow. However, what followed ended up being quite an enjoyable experience regardless. First and foremost, don't go into this movie expecting a serious, intense, thriller. Go in with a ""Cabin in the Woods"" mindset more than anything. If you can do that, you'll enjoy yourself and laugh at this film more than jump in your seats. We had fun doing things like trying to predict who would be the stereotypical characters of this film. You've got the survivor, you've got the bad guy, you've got the guy who disappears/""dies"" that you forget about for awhile that shows up unexpectedly to save the survivor, you've got it all.

5591506,3,B00BEIYNIW,"If you are looking for creative storytelling or character development....just keep on looking. ""You're Next"" has neither. What is does have is a high body count and some fun old-school F/X.

As the film opens we see a couple get murdered (right after having sex of course) by someone wearing a farm animal mask. And then the story kicks in. Basically a wealthy family is having a weekend get together in their home located in deep in the woods. We first meet the mother and father, then each of the kids with their significant other. As a horror movie fan, I knew exactly what type of movie was going to get after that opening, and was happy to see a large pool or potential victims. We immediately don't like anyone in this family. Each is screechy, whiny and unpleasant, and when they sit down to dinner they soon fall under fire from the masked killer now armed with a crossbow. There are a few twists and turns in the film (nothing that genre fans won't see coming from miles away) enough that I don't want to spoil anything.

I have to say I enjoyed this film, I don't think it is one I would buy or re-visit, but for a quick, bloody fun time, it's worth a pick up. There are some fun kills and visuals, the creepy animal masks make for a cool visual (unless you are WWE fan, then all you can see is Erick Rowan...and you can't think of how much better this film would be if it were a vehicle for the Wyatt Family?). I do like the old school gore f/x. There are some great scenes of bloodshed in here and if you are a gorehound, you'll enjoy the film.

Overall this is a much better home invasion film than ""The Purge"", but not as good as ""The Strangers"". Worth a view, but not a purchase.",1409270400,,1694,4.271028037383178

There is some fun to be had with the imaginative ""kills"" (that's not a spoiler is it -- that some people get killed?). But they are inserted into a more compelling story than you would find in Friday the 13th, Final Destination, etc.  And while I can't say that anyone in the film got unfairly overlooked for an Academy Award, most of the performances are solid.  I remember this not making much of an impression at the box office - it might of ended up competing with ""The Conjuring"" or another early-in-the-year horror movie.

The villains manage to stay pretty creepy throughout most of the movie, doing a lot with a little in the dirty white masks.  Sure the mask gimmick has been done before, many times, but this group pulls it off as a believable bunch of fallible human sociopaths.
Sharni Vinson as Erin is the real highlight though.

5592035,3,B00BEIYNIW,"As one of the latest entries into the home invasion horror genre, it leaves a lot to be desired. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of killing to go around yet the handful of suspenseful moments is not enough to make it stand out from the rest.

There is almost an inevitable need to draw comparison to other, more successful, examples of this type of film such as The Strangers. The Strangers succeeds in building its fear because when it all comes down to things, the intruders do not have a logical reason for harassing and hunting people down other than the sheer element of appalling joy. It's knowing that anyone is a target for the intruders, devoid of any particular logical reasoning such as being rich, where the sheer terror lies. It seems as though wealth and material possessions are of no importance to them as opposed to the villains in `You're Next'.

Typically, there is a character or two that the audience connects with and roots for but unfortunately, the characters in the dysfunctional family are over-written and over-played to the point where the audience fails to care about any of them. Even the parents seem to be cold and clammy, and rather than wonder why they were regrettably blessed with such brats, you never bat an eye for the manner in which the kids turned out. The one character who is a departure from the typical helpless maiden is Erin, a girlfriend of one of the boys. At the risk of spoiling the film for anyone who hasn't seen it, I'll just say that her actions prove that no plan is fail safe.

The acting is...let me see...well there's no reason to go ring around the Rosy cause they all fall down. Let's just say the performances and the storyline were not its strengths. The premise isn't original but the occasional scare, moody setting and the clever repeated use of a track by the Dwight Twilley band is enough to keep things interesting.

Bottom line: I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it. It feels like the movie skirts around the issues and key people die for their sins without realizing what their sins were, all in favor of chase/kill scenes that can give the impression of deja vu. In other words, it'd be nice to support the `action' with some substance but I realize the challenge and danger when dialog slows down the momentum of a film such as this. I'd recommend watching `Funny Games' if you are looking for something more psychologically frightening. Otherwise, `You're Next' may be the treat you have been looking for.

Basically, it's a slasher movie somewhat inspired by the Menendez brothers, but it's so unrealistic, and the blend of horror and weak, lame humor just doesn't work.  The most unrealistic aspect of this foolish movie is the Australian girlfriend, who is apparently made of Teflon - she leaps out of a second-story window largely unscathed, she yanks a shard of glass and knives out of her body with very little reaction, she survives a gunshot wound - she's almost inhuman.  She's like Rasputin - she just doesn't die - and she's so overly and annoyingly resourceful to the point of being Miss Goody Two-Shoes.  Most of the actors and actresses are pretty good, but some of the performances are hammy and amateurish.  This film is a waste of time.",1404950400,6,871,4.851351351351352

There's really no gimmick here, it's just a straight up home invasion movie with some good plot twists to back it up.

This is a family who is in a cold war and gather together despite their problems but the party is short lived as someone in animal masks with cross bows start killing these people. As the evening progresses and the body count rises, we come to know the true intention of these killers and who is going to survive this attack and this is why the movie was so much fun. Without telling you much about the happenings, I will mention that one of the guests has grown up in a survivalist commune and those skills become very very useful. The pleasure is watching this character outsmart the predators in the animal masks.

5592543,5,B00BEIYNIW,Reallly enjoyable twist on a hack/slash film genre. Some good jolts with a nice twist of humor thrown in. Recommended!,1395100800,,118,4.95
5592544,5,B00BEIYNIW,"i found the over-saturation of previews for you're next to be tiresome, and was not particularly drawn to it. then a friend highly recommended it, so he, my brother, and i set down to watch it.

instantly, I was drawn in. earlier in the day, while heading out to a budhist temple in the country, my family drove through super affluent, mansion-riddled neighborhoods and i started fixating on the notion of a horror movie set in such an enclave. the opening shots of this movie are gorgeous, establishing the setting, and letting us know exactly what our victims are like. a typical bickering, dysfunctional, rich family gathers to celebrate their parents' anniversary, bringing together the children and their various romantic partners. one brother establishes himself as the alpha bully, systematically targeting his sibling's boyfriends and girlfriends about their careers and life choices. and then...

BOOM!

when this movie get's rolling, it's like a breath of fresh air. instead of spending 40 banal minutes getting a rote intro to the characters and their relationships, you're next lets us get to know them while they are under assault, unseen, unknown, unexpected. quickly, the family begins to show its' true stripes, the cowards cowering, and the heroes rising. the family scrambles to escape, survive, and prepare. it is in the films first arc, that you're next is thoroughly disturbing and unsettling; the bf's and gf's don't engender too much sympathy, but watching family members weep over their loved ones is excruciating, particularly one death early on that shows that this movie is serious about its' mission: to be uncompromising.

so, as the family struggles to survive their unseen assailants, whom we see dressed in animal masks and using a variety of weapons (it's really slasher heaven), we are assaulted by a variety of sounds and instruments, bowel-loosening tuba blasts, and hackle-raising string assaults. and then...

this dark and disturbing movie changes tone with complete deftness. the dark, close-up camera that gives unbearable purview of the victims and survivors, gives way to something more energetic, more eighties, and more rousing. it's so brilliantly done, and my brother, friend, and i looked at each other at the exact same moment and said ""did you see that? did you see what they just did"" the music is a major propulsion in this change, and you start to hear the inspiration and influence of john carpenter and goblin as the score becomes synth-based. it's just beautiful. a rapid fire succession of very clear references to a nightmare on elm street, halloween, escape from new york, dawn of the dead, rear window, the evil dead, and zombi pile up on one another in 5 minutes of inspired brilliance.

one character in particular, erin, played by sharni vinson, really establishes a smart, resilient presence, so much so, that she is an obvious amalgam of fright cinema's proud tradition of final girls, most notably nancy thompson, laurie strode, and kirsty cotton. vinson will have you on your feet, and appreciating director adam wingard's understanding of clover's trope, and the awesomely 80's-esque execution of it. vinson is totally powerful, displaying resourcefulness, toughness, smarts, and just general a$$-kickery. verily, she was awesome.

wingard is really working it, and you're next is just 90 efficient minutes of awesome. the camera is superb, delivering beautiful exterior shots, beginning with a bunch of voyeuristic close-ups before the animals are out in the open, and then perfect wide shots that deliver very clear presentations of the ratcheted-up action.

i loved this movie. it was fresh and an exciting, and did some really nice, courageous things. and when it was straight slasher, it really pushed the envelope in nice directions. dynamic and vibrant, you're next was a complete joy.",1395014400,27,3860,5.194533762057878

5592546,2,B00BEIYNIW,"I just finished watching the movie after taking a pass on it for some time. The preview was the reason for my delay in watching this movie and my suspicions were correct. The story/plot has been used manymany times on TV and the Big Screen, so there wasn't much left to ones imagination regarding the who's or why's for the home invasion. The story did have a couple of twist that if you are paying attention to you will see coming.
It was somewhat nice to see a female as the savior, but as usual she was like the Energizer Bunny or the Terminator. Hollyweird either plays them as weak and helpless or over the top (OTT) super soldiers like in this production. Some of her antics were OTT and made little sense for a fighting for survival mindset and were illogical. The same can be said for male characters in these roles!
When everything was going bad there was only one person that I wanted to see survive and it was our heroine the rest were behaving so badly that I wanted to see them meet an untimely end.
The movie does have good production values plus the acting is better than most in this genre, but what hurts this movie is the predictable story, the OTT performance by the one girl Seal Team Six member and the direction. The director misses on a few fronts that include a lack of suspense and tension, not noticing how predictable the story is and the total one girl wrecking crew.
The movie contains a good amount of violence/blood and some gore with a few partial nude sex scenes. I was surprised that the foul language was kept to a minimum and I think only a few of the F words were used in the entire movie.
I will give this 2 stars for the production values and acting, but the totally predictable plot/story and lack of suspense and tension really hurt this movie.",1394668800,2,1785,4.379518072289157

5592669,4,B00BEIYNIW,"If a comedy is a game of rugby, then horror is the dressage phase of a three day equestrian event.

There is a rigid formal structure to, er, cleave to, and success or failure is eked out of nuances and minor variations within that sturdy frame. All the more so with the Home Invasion sub-genre, of which form Adam Wingards Youre Next, which has been in a holding pattern waiting for clearance to land at Lionsgate international for nearly two years, is a superior example.

An adult family is convening at a remote and cavernous mansion in rural Missouri to celebrate the wedding anniversary of parents no-one seems to like. The four offspring are Drake (Joe Swanberg), Crispian (AJ Bowen), Felix (Nicholas Tucci) and Aimee (Amy Seimetz). All arrive bearing significant others of a more or less waspish bearing: all but Crispian, that is, whose Erin (Sharni Vinson) is a wide-eyed and wholesome Australian who, at first sight, might have been the girl living next door to the Minogues.

Erin discloses that she was a graduate student who shacked up with Crispian while he was her academic supervisor, a scenario which Drake views with evident distaste. Then Aimees boyfriend Tariq (Ti West) discloses that he is an underground film producer. In Drakes eye, this is even worse. Father (Rob Moran) creases his cultivated brow ineffectually as bread rolls begin to fly.

A few hundred yards away a gang of masked men are about to perpetrate brutal acts on the neighbour Erik (Larry Fessenden) and his sullen teenaged girlfriend Kelly (Margaret Laney). Erik is an unpleasant middle aged man with an earring, and Kelly scowls at him admirably as he completes his manly business. She sticks the Dwight Twilley Band on high rotate as he showers (perhaps still looking for the magic lacking in his embrace) and is not thereafter around for long enough for the resentment she transparently harbours to make any difference. But then, nor is he.

Meanwhile back at the castle, the delicate atmosphere is quickly punctured over dinner by fraternal sniping: Drake nettles Crispian for his underachieving and philandering academic ways, while mother (Barbara Crampton) whimpers neurotically. Felix and his gothic girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn) look on malevolently, and we are just beginning to wonder what wholesome Erin mut be making of all this when crossbow bolts start flying through the window. Amusingly, despite this unnerving intrusion the family bickering continues. For all their braggadocio, none of them shows much backbone against the intruders except Erin, who turns out to be far more resourceful than anyone (murderous gang included) expects.

Thus proceeds a well directed, thoughtfully edited, well paced horror thriller with a couple of neat and unexpected twists along the way. Wingard has fun with the grand guignol, expertly flexes the tension inherent in the format, and never forgets to leaven what might otherwise have been a grim experience with snippy humour and sharp dialogue. There are a couple of ingenious kills along the way, including one which I rather think counts as a small-scale homage to the lawnmower scene in Peter Jacksons Brain Dead.

The genre certainly isn't everyones cup of tea: make no mistake there is plenty of gore and a jump-scare on autorotate every five minutes or so (rather like Dwight Tilleys Looking for the Magic), but this is an entertaining and well executed film.

During dinner, people start to be killed by unknown assailants wearing animal masks.  The ending was similar to the ending in ""Night of the Living Dead"".  But there is nothing supernatural about this movie. The main flaw I found in the movie is why the father insisted upon going into the house when he found the door ajar.  But if he hadn't, there would be no story.  It's definitely worth watching!",1393459200,,577,4.543689320388349
5592673,4,B00BEIYNIW,"There are a number of movies that come out each year put into the hands of a marketing team that then turn around and make you believe you're watching one type of movie when it's actually another. Confused yet? Okay let's consider this. The horror genre is making major inroads into mass culture. No longer are horror films the once in a blue moon genre but more often they're the main thing playing. So if a movie has horrific elements a marketing team highlights those even if the movie isn't really a horror film at all. Take YOU'RE NEXT for example.

The movie opens with a man and woman attacked in a home invasion that really has little to do with the plot other than to establish the villains, a group that wears animal masks and brutally kills the couple. It moves from there to a family reunion of sorts in a secluded, wooded area. First to arrive are mom and dad, both apparently retired and looking forward to the weekend getaway with the now grown kids.

First to arrive is Crispian, a teacher and his girlfriend Erin. Not as successful as he had hoped, it becomes a sore point later on with his more successful brother. As the story unfolds you realize that there are many unresolved issues between various family members but that is nothing compared to what they will soon face.

The next day the rest of the family arrives in the form of older brother Drake, their sister and younger brother Felix and his new girlfriend. The low level bickering begins and culminates at the dinner table with Drake insulting his sister's new boyfriend. When the boyfriend goes over to the window to look outside glass is shattered, he turns and we see an arrow sticking out of his chest. The movie turns from a family convergence to a home invasion film unlike any other.

Unable to cope with the reality of what's going on it is Erin that saves the day and calls out instructions to the rest in an attempt to stave off the attackers. While the invaders might have planned on this family falling apart they had no clue what they would get in Erin. The family is forced to come together on a basic level if they are going to survive this. Traps have been set, some invaders have already been hidden in the house and the only ones armed seem to be the bad guys.

So what we're presented with here is more of a thriller, along the lines of something Alfred Hitchcock might have made were he alive today. Even more so as things begin to slowly unspool with each minute of the film and we learn why this is happening and just who is behind it. To say the final revelation is not one most will see coming doesn't do it justice. And now that I've said that don't watch expecting to find clues easily as to that ending. Just know once they start to come, more follow.

The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout even though it takes a short time to get going. But then if you don't establish the players here nothing makes sense. Even the early portrayal of Erin as a student aid who seems to be pretty frail is turned upside down along with many other characters in the movie.
At first glimpse one could mistake this for the torture porn films that I've come to loathe over the past few years. Be glad that this doesn't fall into that genre at all. Instead it's a white knuckle ride that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the final credits roll. Top notch acting, a solid story, great effects and some smooth camerawork make this film one that will stick in your memory come bed time. What more could you ask for from a thriller?",1393372800,,3553,4.3839150227617605
5592674,5,B00BEIYNIW,"First typical horror, then gothic horror, supernatural horror, torture porn, then even home invasion horror. Thought I'd seen every bit of imagination Hollywood had.
Then this surprised me. I've been used to such crappy storylines, ""advanced"" special effects, and cliches galore that it would seem like I would be able to predict every person's every move. That was the first five minutes (which includes the only sex scene in the movie). After that, I was very well surprised by a story of family reunion, familial tension, backstory, and just as surprised as the rest of the people when the heroine turned out to be more like a Joss Whedon-made feminine character: strong, independent, very smart, etc.
In other words, she knows how to hold her own.
And not only is that angle unique, there were several death scenes that implemented unique styles that I've never seen in any ""decent"" horror movie.
Even though the movie was quite unique in terms of an actually strong female hero (oh wait, there's also the lass in Evil Dead) and a disturbing conspiracy behind the killings, I did think it could have done well with a little less swearing (that seemed a little overdone a couple of times) and the ending shot? Though I saw it coming mere moments before it happened, I did end up laughing a bit at the gallows humor.

5592751,5,B00BEIYNIW,"They don't make a lot of simple but satisfying to watch slasher/terrorise a group of people flicks these days.  The basic plot has been done before in horror genre but this one rewrites it well.  Basically a well off family is having a reunion at their parent's holiday home in the rural isolated countryside.  Unbeknownst to them a group of men dressed in farm animal masks slashed up their neighbours down the road the day before they all arrived.  Their dysfunctional family dinner is about to get interrupted.

I quite enjoyed this one, it does have your yelling at the screen why would you do that moments (directed at both the family under siege and bad guys), but I actually think this an enjoyable part of these types of films.  Obviously the bad guys could have achieved their goals with a lot less risk to themselves but killing each victim differently is a lot better to watch than doing it simpler and more affectively. Some kills also rely on a lot of factors following their fantasy exactly to come off such (spoiler scene alert) as fishing wire needing to be at an exact height of the victim when how would you know which victim it's going to be. Some things occur that aren't possible in the time frame such as writing in blood You're Next on a Wall when others would have arrived seconds later after the screams. The villains weren't as dim-witted as say the ones in Home Alone but the traps inside the house were a lot deadlier too.  Although (spoiler alert for another scene) why the lamb guy looked through the window and saw wood with nails through them and then thought I'll step on that anyway, yet was surprised it hurt I can't fathom.

I thought the family didn't act entirely like people in this situation would, especially the mother who really should have taken on a protect her children status. Granted she obviously wasn't a fan of any of her children's partners but she should have at least put her own well being behind that of her own kids. She should have been the first one to put her hand up for the high risk get help scene near the start.  But then again I guess there are people like that in the real world.  Plus having unlikeable character as really all the family were, makes it more fun to watch them get killed each time. I actually liked how none of the characters are played by big name actors.

5592829,3,B00BEIYNIW,"It's strength is it's heroine, nice acting, good transition where she took charge when the mayhem started. The weak point is the parents don't appear rich. The story says the parents are well off, but based on the car they drive, their clothes and lack of bling (in the movies rich people look rich, even when they're dressing down), and the way their second home looks, the fact that the mom prepared dinner for 10 by herself, and the dad didn't look polished (he needed to be in cashmere at the very least, with perhaps a $500 hair cut; his hands needed to be shown so we could see his well-manicured fingers, it would've helped if we'd seen him wearing $5,000 Italian loafers). This couple don't appear to be able to leave their two sons so large a fortune that they'd believably slaughter the majority of their immediate family. If your story says that two adult 30+ something sons are conspiring to kill their parents and siblings for serious money, it'd really help the believability factor if the parents look like they have serious money, like $100 million plus. The parents looked like they were maybe worth $10 to $20 million, including property, at most. In other words, they looked upper middle class, definitely well off, but not slaughter-your-parents-and-siblings wealthy, especially for characters the ages of these perps. Storywise, to murder your family for a piddling $20 million doesn't work unless there are other problems, i.e. the sons are businessmen with businesses on the rocks, or one has a drug problem, maybe the parents are abusive, or the sons were experiencing some sort of other pressure, something, anything, but the story offered nothing. Two of the sons had abit of a snit during dinner, but that seemed like normal squabbling, though they were alittle old for it and their behavior was somewhat discourteous to their parents and their guests.  Also the sons didn't want to commit the atrocious acts, so the parents needed to have big money, and the story needed to give reasons for the sons' actions, for the film to work: as written, story was unbelievable. The acting was mostly fine. Also unbelievable, that anyone would let their only daughter exit the front door while the house was under attack: weak. Filmmakers focused on especially gruesome ways of killing people, so not very interesting there: should've worked harder on having story make sense. Wasn't a total fail, worth watching if you like horror home invasion movies. I didn't know what it was about and had I known probably wouldn't have checked it out from the library, but now that I've seen it, worth watching for the smart lead character. 2 and a half stars.

My above critique still stands but considering that the filmmaking team made this film for such a small amount, I'm boosting my review another star, to 3 and a half stars.

5592910,1,B00BEIYNIW,"*** Warning: spoilers ahead

Once youve come to term with the fact that you need to be a bit sick in the head in order to make (and watch  I include myself) such a movie, you can sort of dissect it for what it is: a pretentious, somewhat original good old slasher movie but a good old slasher movie just the same. With all the usual dumb stuff in it that nobody normal would never ever do.

With that being said, I don't know what is more terrifying: the story itself or the intentions of the creators that you can hear in the extras. And for that matter, the reaction people have when you read the reviews on Amazon are just as weird, If not worrying. The people behind this film and some of the fans are talking about a comedy, a funnier horror film, a re-invention of the genre, original and new ways of killing people, lots of gore and so on. Wow I enjoy horror flicks but to that extent? We all have a darker side and these kinds of movies, not only are giving us a rush of adrenaline, yes, and are also acting as some sort of outlet. I get that. But should we take that much pleasure in it? Shouldnt we be more responsible in our appreciation of that kind of release of more violent urges? Anyhow, that is not really my point here. What I mostly wanted to talk about was the pretentions of the people involved in this story.  Especially when they are talking about taking the genre to a whole new level. Really?

There is truly exciting stuff in this film. The fact that were discovering the characters while jumping immediately into the action is worth mentioning (instead of wasting twenty minutes of useless intros). Boum! There is it is. One person dies in front of everybody, the killers revealing their intentions right away. No two ways about it. The movie is not even 10 minutes long. Although not original, it is refreshing to say the least. Also, at some point, there is a reversal of situation in which the usual passive and responsible heroine is instead taking charge and, in a way, becoming the hunter, making a Rambo out of herself.  We are starting to root for her, identifying ourselves in her courage and resourcefulness along the way. Again, while it may not necessarily be original, it is nevertheless distinctive (although it is becoming a trend  Im thinking of I Spit On Your Grave and others).

There stops the so-called originality. Along come the usual clichs, poor story devices and dumb reactions. First, the weak character development. Why wouldnt you psychologically prepare your girlfriend to meet your weird family? Why would you simply say to her: youll see? What mother sends her new sons girlfriend to a strangers house, in the woods, in order to ask for milk? Of course, the patriarch will laugh at his wife for thinking somebody is in the house. And, obviously, the strange and gothic girlfriend of one of the sons has something to do with the killings. It is written on her face. And what in the hell does the attractive and courageous heroine sees in her new boyfriend, a weak and fearful chubby, bearded half of a man? As for the horror devices, well  Would you enter into a big isolated mansion in the woods if the front door was strangely open? Would you still walk freely in the house if you knew somebody was inside? Would you send your own daughter outside if it was obvious the killers were there, waiting with bows and arrows? Would you go to sleep alone in your room after the killings have started and after it was obvious that those killers were inside? Who in their right mind would look under the bed? Or inside a keyhole? Who would run out of that house given the situation?

So much for reinventing the genre  Is there no way to make a genuine good and original horror film? Some of the ideas here were well constructed. Why then ruin everything with such clichs and poor character development? Obviously, there was a strong desire for originality. Obviously, the creators are intelligent. How can you actually say that you want to get away from the clichs or the self-mockery seen in Scream and then put such stupid stuff?

The story is pretty easy to follow: an unknown murderer wants to kill a family without any apparent reason. But that's just a little bit of what the movie is about. The movie shows how a ""normal"" family would react to a situation similar to the one of this film, there's not the typical group of a slasher, it's just a family. The deaths are pretty cool, some of them graphic when they have to be graphic and others not, so, it's not exactly a bloodfest if you're expecting that from this movie.
Also, Sharni Vinson proves that she has the abilty to carry a movie on her shoulders, I hope she keeps acting in horror movies.
But the best part of the movie is the big twist. The twist is something so unexpected and it changes the whole view of the story from one minute to another.

I am, however, a fan of horror with brains, that takes a realistic approach to its subject matter, without holding anything back, that sets out to do nothing more than creep you out.

YOU'RE NEXT is such a film.  The premise is fairly simple: a family decides to get together in a rural house for a wedding anniversary.  Unbeknownst to them, they aren't the only ones who've been planning for this occasion.  Very quickly, tensions escalate, tempers flare...and that's before a band of strangers begins to brutally murder everyone.

Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett keep things nice and organic; the acting (from a largely unknown cast) is superb and realistic, as is the gore (yes, there's a lot, though the gratuity is used for parodic effect).  It's nice to see a horror film with few pretensions, some actual scares, a thoroughly creepy vibe, and a genuinely strong female protagonist (Erin isn't some Amazonian goddess; she's actually a strong woman who just happens to have a background that makes her well-suited to fighting back).

1. This is a quirky little horror comedy. Theres not much to it, but its fun.

2. Its about a group of killers that invade a family reunion and start picking off the people one by one.

3. Its really low-budget. I think most of the money was spent on the blood and gore effects. It certainly wasn't spent on actors or the script.

4. It was filmed in four weeks, during nights, at a mansion in Columbia, Missouri.

5. Indie horror director Ti West has a role in the movie.

6. The plot doesnt make much sense. There would have been easier ways to accomplish what the killers are trying to do.

7. In a refreshing change of pace, its a woman that has the brains and ability to lead the fight against the killers, not a man.

8. There are some nifty and fun kill scenes. It gets pretty bloody, what with all the blades and bludgeoning.

9. The kill scenes get goofier and goofier as the movie goes on. Can we please stop using blenders as weapons?",1390867200,,984,4.219251336898396

Too much sadism, too much gore, too much hopelessness, too many idiotic characters doing everything not to live, too much outlandish violence for the sake of outlandish violence. ""Youre next"" does have some of these undesirable qualities but doesn't go as far with them as most (Hostel anyone?). What makes this movie four-star is the survivalist, smart (the only one), resourceful, tough as nails, unassuming, fierce Erin (Vinson). She is like Laurie Strode on steroids and uppers. When this woman fights back, she goes all Michael Myers on these unknowing bastards. Brutal, yes, but these baddies have it coming and whew does she give it. Its just unusual for these type movies to actually have a fighter, not just a runner and a screamer, but one who actually fights back, with toughness and no mercy.

5593226,5,B00BEIYNIW,I am the guy that when you watch horror movies points out that would never happen like the microwave scene from last house on the left sure love stuff like that but like stuff more realistic. That said this film only has one of those type kills involving a blender the rest of the movie is realistic. All the way down to the creepiness of people sleeping in your house waiting to attack your family when the dad discovers the empty water bottles and the urine filled ones nice touch. This takes the whole cat and mouse  effect and freshness it up by changing who is the cat and who is the mouse. The story is strong from start to finish the only mistake I saw was the boyfriend and girlfriend talking like they are about to get married and him not knowing about her dad raising her in a survivalist camp. For the first time in my life I have to say a horror movie with an actual brain is in here. Yes I typically hate females kicking every man's ass in movies but instead of Braun it is done using more instincts and brain a true welcome to the horror genre hope we see more of this. I gave it 5 but would have given it a 4.5 if Amazon had that option I was entertained and the humor is light doesn't detract from how great this movie is.

5593229,4,B00BEIYNIW,"It's a testament to how much they love me that my friends continue to watch horror movies with me. I'm the only one in my social circle with that die hard compulsion for scary films, which isn't so hard to understand, given the track record for the industry. 90% of the movies I convince my girlfriend or buddies to endure are pretty much a waste of time. The genre is bloated with cliches, rewarmed leftovers, and ripoffs. But I was raised on MST3K and George Romero, and even if a good scary movie is -- indeed -- hard to find, I won't give up. After all, there's something intrinsically invigorating about a really good horror film that makes it, on a visceral and instinctual level, just as powerful (if not more so) than the greatest action or drama. It's like comparing the thrill of bungee jumping with the thrill of reading an amazing book. One of them just taps into that basic human code of survival. I won't go into the psychological merits of either, other than to say that horror movies -- when done right -- resonate with audiences in a way that goes beyond analysis and the cold rigor of logic.

My search for a perfect horror movie continues, but YOU'RE NEXT has come the closest in recent years to hitting the mark.

The story concerns a wealthy family who have gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the patriarch and his wife. During a tense dinner (the siblings aren't exactly blood brothers ... at first), the group is attacked by a trio of unknown assailants with crossbows. The film becomes a fight of survival, with most of the group getting picked off one by one. All except Erin, the girlfriend of one of the family members, who proves to be far more adept at survival than either the family or the assailants could ever have predicted.

The pacing of the movie is perfect, and the tenacious stranger element pumps fresh life into what might otherwise have been a stale home invasion script. There are a few other surprises that keep the movie from seeming too cliched or predictable, and even to the last frame, the flick maintains a grim sense of humor about itself, but without getting too jokey or hammy about it. It is, from start to finish, satisfying in that visceral level that horror films are seeking to appeal to.

It's not perfect. The tone is uneven, with both the dialogue and the soundtrack failing to fully embrace whether it wants to be sincere or a parody of itself (listen for the weird 80's synth that stops and starts out of nowhere 2/3rds of the way through the film: I call it ""Erin's Theme""). There are also plot holes that the film doesn't try very hard to fill in, including (but not limited to) people splitting up, the turning off of a cell phone jammer, the durability of blenders, the insistent use of vision-crippling masks, and various pulled punches. Similarly, since the cast is so large (at first) a whole lot of characterization gets thrown out of the window with the inclusion of people who become lamely insane when the feces hits the fan (think ""tons of screaming about how we're all going to die""). The acting is also second rate (except from Erin), but only rarely to the point of distraction.

However, even with these pretty common horror movie flaws, the story keeps itself and the viewers on toes made of pins and needles, and the fact that Erin provides a believable and powerful protagonist for the killers to grind against makes it easy to ignore some of the more glaring flaws in the script. All in all, it tries harder and succeeds more than most of its kin have in recent years, making this a film I would gladly recommend to horror movie fans and the beleaguered friends that put up with them.",1390348800,2,3673,4.56752655538695

5593299,1,B00BEIYNIW,"The only thing about this movie that can be considered horrorifying is the plot and acting. It takes about 35-40 minutes for something interesting to happen, and when it does, it's poorly portrayed & executed. The whole mystique of the attackers is ruined when they start talking and taking their masks off.

There is nothing about this movie that stands out from other films. NOTHING. If you want a home invasion film, I'd recommend ""The Strangers"". At least the killers in that movie openly admit that they had no motive, other than that they were just attacking their victims because ""they were home"". In You're Next, well, I don't want this to be a spoiler review, so i'll just say when you see it, and you finally know the motive of the killers, you're going to be saying in your head ""I had a feeling that's what it was. god, that's predictable!"" You'll be wishing that that wasn't their motive.

5593302,3,B00BEIYNIW,"As I was watching the movie, I found myself stopping every 10min to write notes. Yes notes, on what was wrong and what I found to be stupid in terms of the characters decisions and what not. I also found myself talking to my monitor..asking why are they so dumb? So bear with me..it'll all make sense once you read till the end. No major spoilers, just my commentary.
1) Don't be shocked when you start rooting for some of them to die. Some of them are real dckwads, so it's okay.
2) Arrows are being shot at you, why are you still standing up? Sure you're shocked by what's going on but shouldn't you're
  immediate reaction be to drop to the floor?
3) And I can't stress this enough when it comes to horror flicks, whyyy in the world would any one suggest to split up or suggest
  one or more persons to go and find help? Why? Just stick together and go from there..
4) Why would you agree and let your daughter run outside to get help without knowing who or what is out there? For all we know
  there could be 30 or 5 people out there capable of doing god knows what.
5) And lets just say she IS the fastest runner in the family, ok cool....but is she freakin faster than a shooting arrow? Can she
  out run it? NO.
6) As the killings begin you will realize that Erin is the smartest and most sensible character in the movie who actually takes
  initiative due to the fact that she had survival training.
7) Why would you leave your wife upstairs alone? What makes you think she's any safer upstairs..alone?
After or while watching the movie, you probably wondered why the writers made the other characters so stupid w/ the exception of Erin. When Erin bashed one of the invaders to death I literally shouted and cheered. Why? Because she didn't just hit him once then ran away like most people in horror flicks. When you have a chance to ""finish them"" while they're down, you do it. Don't
give them the opportunity to recover and chase after you again. With that said, Erin is a very worthy ""final girl""..even if the writers purposely made her the heroine. Everyone else was an idiot so that she can shine and that worked for the movie. It wasn't until the end of the film that I remembered that it was a horror COMEDY. Everything now all makes sense. No way characters can be that dumb. The film is only getting 3 stars b/c I enjoyed Erin kicking everyone's ass. I rented this and I'm not sure if it was worth it..but if you have a couple of bucks lying around and have free time, go for it.",1390089600,,2496,4.280254777070064
5593393,4,B00BEIYNIW,"BTW, I guessed who was behind the killings in the movie ""You're Next"" when the proper use of the ""You're"" contraction was written in blood on the walls of the murder scenes.
Of course, the funniest part is the dining room assault scene where everyone is running around in circles, some with arrows sticking out of them, and the patriarch announces that he cannot get a cell phone signal even though he had one earlier in the day. The older son then yells over the panicked screams and confusion from across the room: ""I've heard it's possible to jam a cell phone signal, although the devices are illegal in the United States, I believe you can buy one for a couple hundred bucks over the internet. I think the website is www dot cellphonejammer dot com. It's probably a Chinese site, but I'm sure the text on the webpage is in English, allowing an American to buy the product as long as the credit card company allows the transaction and the package can get past customs""
You know, I realize the existence of cell phones makes it hard for horror authors to create perilous situations for characters, but did this screenwriter really have to go to such lengths to explain why signal jamming made it impossible for the characters to use their phones?",1390003200,,1248,4.6008968609865475

5593397,4,B00BEIYNIW,"House invasion film is the best I can do to describe this film.  Not exactly a bad sub-genre, if you ask me, but one I usually look to foreign markets to do right, rather than the states... and really, that is still true, since this film was a copy of a foreign film.

A family gathers at their 'out in the woods' home for various reasons.  When they all sit down for dinner, strangers in white animal masks interrupt.  Some blood, people yelling, kills ranging from creative to yawn inspiring, bad decision making, one person fighting back and that is the film.

Not perfect, not genre redefining, but certainly worth a watch.  Some things will not make sense, something I've come to expect in such films.  For example, I'll never understand why they used the phrase, ""You're Next"".  It simply did not fit or make any logical sense, especially as the film progresses and you get into reasons for why things are happening.  These minor ""wtf?"" moments do not ruin the film, however.

It is a home invasion, somewhat slasher film.  If you are into that sort of thing, go for it.  Just do not try to overanalyze it... it'll make your head hurt, like you've likely seen in various film discussion sites.  Take it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it.",1389916800,,1245,4.5291479820627805

Sounds like every other story we're used to seeing in a home invasion thriller; however, things change for the killer -- and the audience -- when one of the guests starts fighting back. I have to say -- this is a film where the pacing doesn't rest, the music is creepy and intense (think cheesy-yet-creepy 1980s synth, but it's cool!), and the twists and turns in the story keep the audience guessing and satisfied. The best thriller of the year!",1389916800,2,1278,6.350574712643678
5593399,5,B00BEIYNIW,"HOORAY FOR LIONSGATE! The studio does its best to keep horror fans supplied, always striving for the unique qualities we find in Youre Next.

What begins as a slasher film, with the standard clichs  senseless slaughter of two after sex, a bloody message  takes a unique turn about three-quarters of the way in. The maneuver helps the movie jump the hurdle on rottentomatoes.com with a 75% like from critics and a 63% appreciation from the audience.

Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett, both of V/H/S/2, pull out a variety of weapons, including a crossbow, ax, machete, screwdriver and blender, in a nasty home invasion story. If you recall the previews, a family is about to have a meal in a manor in the woods, when one of them is taken out by a crossbow bolt to the forehead. Much screaming and running about follows, with only one cluing the others to Get down! Apparently, no one there has ever seen any action-thriller or theyd know not to stand in front of well-lit windows so the gang of armed, masked killers outside can pick them off.

Most of the party goes down fast while a handful stick it out to battle their attackers. The white animal masks paired with black clothing help provide some good jump-scares, while the main protagonist realistically manages to give back. A cast of good character actors  including Sharni Vinson, Nicholas Tucci, AJ Bowen, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton and Margaret Laney  hold their own.

Be aware that many think the movie is a horror-comedy. That alone gave me shivers. Still, in the commentary with Wingard and Barrett, they discuss how they wanted to open the movie with the death of a small dog or a baby with the requisite head left for the next victim to find along with the bloody message. The pair found this concept absolutely hilarious, but opted for something different for which Im grateful, as the film wouldve been over for me right there. They also talk about how funny it was to have one of the victims walk around with an arrow in his back, since it didn't kill him outright.

I must be missing something in the humor department because I am still not amused, although I think the movie is a successful horror flick.

A second audio commentary with Wingard, Barrett, and actors Sharni Vinson and Barbara Compton offers more serious info such as how to give a good performance in a horror movie. There is also pertinent info on how the movie was created and edited. The best of the lot is No Ordinary Home Invasion: The Making of Youre Next, a shorty with interviews from the cast, director and writer. Barrett begins by saying he wrote the film with some of the cast members in mind. All indicate how Youre Next is a level above standard horror films  but no, its not exactly a breakthrough, guys. Check out Cabin in the Woods, for example, which actually does manage to combine horror and comedy.

5593483,5,B00BEIYNIW,"Warning: this review contains spoilers!!

This is not your typical home invasion film. We've seen others (The Strangers, Funny Games, Mother's Day, etc.) and they were entertaining, but for the most part, you knew where they were going. With ""You're Next,"" that isn't always the case. There are some twists here, none of which are earth shattering, but they are believable to an extent within the context of the film's setting. At times, it's hard to feel bad for the wealthy, petulant family in the beginning of the invasion, when they start getting picked off one by one. Then, Sharni Vinson's character takes an epic turn, as she turns out to have a special skill set that nobody saw coming. Once she gets going, it's impossible not to root for her as she proceeds to brutally take revenge against the armed invaders one by one, using everything from blenders to meat cleavers, booby-trapping the house Macaulay Culkin style, foiling the criminals with a MacGyver-like cunning precision.

There are a few laughs here and there too, almost as if the film acknowledges that by the cheesy title and concept, that it's a cliche before it even hits the screen. As the saying goes, however, sometimes you know where a movie is going but it's fun watching it get there. This is the ultimate example of a movie in which you think you know where it's going, and then it takes a satisfying, bloody turn that horror fans will love. There's gore, revenge, devastation, suspense, action, and twists.

5593488,5,B00BEIYNIW,"You're Next isn't just my favorite horror in a long time; it's one of my favorite movies of the year in any genre.

Unlike some of my other favorite horror movies of recent years, You're Next isn't about a whole lot more than it's about. It has none of the political implications of The Woman and isn't interested in the meta deconstructionism of The Cabin in the Woods. This is not to say it contains no subtext; director Adam Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett are clearly interested in blowing up some genre conventions and tweaking the traditional role of the Final Girl. But that stuff is secondary. More than anything, it's a movie that's incredibly good at being scary, suspenseful, funny, entertaining, and FUN; a testament to having solid foundationsgood writing, good direction, good cast. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just rolls it really well.

There's a case to be made that You're Next is secretly about relationshipsthe things we do and do not tell our partners, and the ways in which revealing those details can impact what we previously thought was a happy union. I know none of that sounds very scary, so please don't think the movie is some Kate Hudson romantic comedy passing itself off as a horror film. The horror here works; Wingard knows how to set up and pay off tension for maximum effect, and You're Next doesn't pull any punches with its intensity. But what makes the film special is that it isn't only about scares and intensity. It's very, very funny and a whole lot of fun.

I have little patience for the home invasion movie, whether it's Funny Games, or The Strangers, or The Purge, or Funny Games (2008), or whatever. This may be because I find them too horrifying; life is terrible enough without feeling like people in masks are going to break into my house and kill my family. The argument could be made that I avoid these movies because they work, which is what good horror movies are supposed to do. With You're Next, it's as if Wingard and Barrett sensed my unease (the world is all about me) and came up with a solution. What that solution is I won't say, but the pair managed to take a genre I typically avoid and spin it into one of my favorite movies of the year.

Anyone who has been waiting for Adam Wingard to blow up should hopefully see it happen after this. There was a ton of good stuff in A Horrible Way to Diea horror movie told as sensitive indie drama, and one I like more every time I see itbut some of the directing choices got in the way of the otherwise strong emotional connections. His contributions to recent horror anthologies like V/H/S, V/H/S/2, and The ABCs of Death have been mixed, with some good ideas and a solid streak of humor (in the latter two), but I hadn't yet seen Wingard firing on every cylinder. That would be You're Next, a movie that understands how to build a scare, how to create sympathetic characters in a short amount of time and, most importantly, gets the tone just right. It's a home invasion/slasher movie that doesn't feel mean spirited. For once, we're not supposed to be rooting for the killers. We like these characterseven the ones who are introduced as douchebagsand we want them to survive. That's a testament to the performances of the cast, many of them indie film veterans and directors themselves, all creating memorable characters that are more than just pencil outlines. Pay attention to the ways in which everyone behaves when the bad things startwho does and who does not try to help, who is brave and who isn't. It goes against our initial impressions, and is just one more example of how clever the movie is.

Lionsgate's You're Next (Blu-ray) does a good job with very deliberate cinematography. The 2.40:1/1080p HD transfer retains the film's graininess and muted color scheme; it's not nearly as polished as some other, bigger budget releases, but that's never what the filmmakers intended. The lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track keeps the dialogue audible while doing its best to enhance the scares with solid ambient presence and strong low end. Wingard and Barrett appear on not one but two commentary tracks. On the first, they're joined by stars Sharni Vinson and Barbara Crampton for a fun and relaxed behind-the-scenes chat; on the second (which they admit they opted to record because they left so much out of the first talk) they get more into production details but never lose their sense of humor. If you've heard a commentary from Wingard and Barrett before, you know how loose and entertaining they can be. The commentaries on You're Next continue that tradition. The only other bonus featuresbesides the excellent (if a bit misleading) trailer and standard DVD copyis a short featurette that's absolutely loaded with spoilers. Watch it only after if you've seen the movie.

5593604,2,B00BEIYNIW,"Whatever happened to the type of basic storytelling in these types of films where the viewer is given sufficient time to actually get to know the characters and their motivations (especially when they are key to important plot twists)? If this were just another slasher, one could argue ""Who cares? I just wanna see cool kills."" Letting a viewer understand a character doesn't need to occur through dialogue (lots of clumsy clunky unrealistic exposition on display here). There can be simple visual clues. There is virtually NOTHING here in the first act which establishes even the most basic groundwork for several radical reveals about several characters' backgrounds and motivations. So, I felt cheated. Which is a shame, b/c the filmmakers CAN construct a powerful, tense siege scene. What made it really frustrating for me was seeing the POTENTIAL for a better story. (for example, one scene where a character reacts SO BELIEVABLY to something unexpected and terrible, and another where a character shudders after killing someone) So much of what's here has been done before and better and I just don't feel the aspects that are quirky and different (praised by some as ""genre-defying"") mesh with the rest of the film. One thing I will say in its favor, even if I can't say whether it was intentional, is that the violence perpetrated by ""the bad guys"" isn't prolonged torture and cruelty. I was surprised by this. For the most part it's just trying to get someone out of the way with one blow or shot. I cite this because one of the protagonists proves (a la the original THE HILLS HAVE EYES) to be incredibly (albeit arguably with reason) cruel and excessive in fighting back. A little irony there. Not enough. Too bad. With better actors and writing for the key roles, this might have ""sold"" me what it was trying to sell. Not recommended, folks.",1389571200,,1854,4.851735015772871

When it comes to horror fans, people either love or hate the home invasion sub genre. I myself am a fan, so take that into account.

I found the film to be chilling, but with some dark humor. The main character, Erin, was refreshing because A.) she was a woman who wasn't a Scream Queen and B.) she fought back. While there were some moments that were predictable, the final twist had me gasping then chuckling. We see not only an unusual twist in a horror film, but some dark humor and Erin kicking butt as well. This was a film that stayed with me for quite a while after watching. It has more realistic characters and poked fun at typical horror stereotypes.
All in all, it's a good night in with a home invasion horror flick that is a new take on the sub genre. I would definitely recommend You're Next.",1389484800,29,830,4.354838709677419

The movie though was.....well it was not....... oh never mind-  it just plain sucked. I'll leave it at that.

PS- Worst film I have seen in the past year. Now if you want my advice and want to see a good horror movie that is a recent release see James Wan's The Conjuring. That is one hell of a great horror movie. But this thing, what are the people who loved this on? I mean really, this thing was terrible.",1389398400,2,717,4.078014184397163
5593611,5,B00BEIYNIW,"* Spoilers *

Erin is invited to a family reunion and wedding anniversary celebration at her boyfriend Crispian's parents' remote vacation house. All of Crispian's siblings will be there with their significant others and she'll be meeting his parents for the first time. Everything seems to be going relatively well besides some typical awkward bickering between brothers until they are savagely attacked by masked assailants. The family doesn't know what to do and acts typically panicked and irrational, so Erin unexpectedly takes the lead in showing them how to defend the house and themselves. How will Erin measure up to three armed men?

I didn't have high expectations for You're Next because it looked too much like The Strangers and every other home invasion film ever, but I was pleasantly surprised. This clever movie takes those tired tropes and subverts expectation to have surprising twists, a fun plot, and fleshed out, nuanced characters. Let's start with the male characters. Brothers Crispian and Felix are the ones who hired to killers to get the inheritance from their parents. They hate the violence and view the murders as an ordeal to be endured despite having orchestrated the entire thing themselves. The killers aren't relentless killing machines. Quite the opposite. They are three friends who have good tactics and were obviously trained in combat, but they make mistakes and miscalculations. When one of them dies, the others are outraged and allow that emotion to get in the way of the task at hand. Too many films portray these types of characters as indestructible and emotionless Micheal Myerses when they are simply people.

Now for the female characters. Erin is the final girl, but she doesn't run around doing stupid things as is typical. She defends herself well, helps the family fortify the house, and isn't afraid to go for the kill in order to survive. Being raised as a survivalist in Australia has its benefits. Zee is Felix's girlfriend who appears aloof and bored with the anniversary party, clearly only there for her boyfriend. After the big reveal, she shows her true colors and her excitement at killing her boyfriend's family. She is there for her own reasons and ceases to try to comfort Felix. Her suggestion to have sex next to Felix's dead mother is flatly rejected, but, coupled with her general attitude, acts to subvert expectations about female behavior, which is usually disgusted and scared by violence and disinterest in sex. Felix's mother Aubrey is more of a stereotypical woman who runs around panicked and does stupid things as a result. However, she sensed something was wrong right when they arrived. Everyone dismissed her as a hysterical woman freaking out for no reason despite the fact that the front door was unlocked and strange sounds were heard in the house. If they had listened to her, a lot more people would be alive. Then when her daughter dies, she takes the time to break down emotionally and mourn her. Too many people in horror films watch loved ones die in front of them and simply go on without a second thought when Aubrey's reaction would be more realistic.

In the final scene of the film, Crispian tells Erin that the plan was to kill his family, but leave her as an unbiased witness to guarantee that he and Felix would get the insurance money. He then tells her if she reacted as a woman should, the plan would have been successful. His own concept of women is quite narrow and doesn't take into account the variety of women that exist like Zee and Erin. He not only blames her for the failure of his plan, but basically says she doesn't act like a woman. Crispian reveals himself to be a despicable human being willing to murder his family for money and a misogynist who can't fathom that women exist outside his narrow view of what is feminine.

You're Next is a fun film that takes a cliche story line that we've seen a thousand times and makes it interesting by subverting those expectation and giving us more realistic characters. It also doesn't take itself completely seriously and has some genuine moments of humor. My favorite death scene was comically over the top and involved a blender. The acting is spot on all around, especially by Sharni Vinson as Erin. You're Next is easily the best horror film of 2013, so watch it if you haven't yet.",1389398400,2,4346,4.828187919463088

What I did like about the movie was the acting--most of it was above average for this type of film.  I also liked the kickass girl who decided from the get-go that she was not going to be a victim!

5593698,3,B00BEIYNIW,"Yes, it's a good view, and yes, the twists work well, and yes, it's nice to see some pretentious hipster douches bite it. But I guess I was expecting more. Honestly, it's not scary, at all. There are a few jumps, but they're pretty telegraphed.

And what's the deal with these killers? Men who at first appear to be professionals (this is hinted at here and there) are using some of the most inefficient weapons possible. A machete and axe? Very cliche. And a crossbow? Ever try reloading one of those on the fly (without even considering doing it in the dark)? Go to Dick's and buy some shotguns guys!

Even with some gaping holes in the narrative, it's not too shabby. Gore hounds will like it, but I'm starting to see why this movie didn't find a distributor for almost two years before its release. Good, but not great.",1389052800,,823,4.48
5593699,4,B00BEIYNIW,"I've been excited to see ""You're Next"" ever since reading about it what seems like over a year ago. Sometimes it takes indie genre films a while to find the right distributor and studio that will give it a chance. ""Everybody Loves Mandy Lane"" is an extreme example of the long time it can take for a movie to make it from festival to Blu-ray and DVD release. I can honestly say that the wait for this home invasion/slasher/horror mutation was worth the wait.

Crispian and his fiancee, Erin, travel to his family's rural Missouri vacation house to celebrate the anniversary of his mother and father. His brothers and sister join them at the secluded mansion for the festivities. As the dysfunctional bunch sit down for a nice dinner, they are brutally attacked by a trio of armed killers. The group must now find a way to survive and fight for their lives as the masked murderers attempt to pick them off one by one.

Although ""You're Next"" isn't perfect or the most original film to be released, it does its job as a thriller and slasher piece. There are some nice twists and turns in the plot, even if you see them heading at you. I compare it to riding a rollercoaster for the third time, but still being excited and taken aback when you hit that familiar loop you know is coming.

The DVD version of ""You're Next"" includes some bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Adam Wingard, Writer Simon Barrett and actors Sharni Vinson and Barbara Crampton. There's also a featurette entitled ""No Ordinary Home Invasion: The Making of 'You're Next'"" and a theatrical trailer.

""You're Next"" is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sensuality/nudity. A lot of blood is shed as you would imagine. The nudity is brief and just at the beginning of the film. It's completely unnecessary as usual and adds nothing to the big picture.

There's really no message or lesson to be found in ""You're Next."" I guess you can stretch and say it warns not to trust anyone. It might also encourage some to take a survivalist class to learn how to live in the wild and be prepared for anything. Aside from that, it's just a gory and gruesome thrill ride.

""You're Next"" will excite fans of home invasion films like ""The Strangers,"" ""Cherry Tree Lane,"" and even ""The Purge."" I consider it to be highly recommendable to genre enthusiasts. One bonus offered by the movie is the chance to see the director of the lame ""The House of the Devil"" flick, Ti West, die a horrible death. That's worth the price of admission alone.",1388966400,,2532,4.615555555555556
5593700,1,B00BEIYNIW,"Not a great plot, boring, slightly exciting just turns to predictable and unrealistic. Was very excited for this from the previews.",1388966400,2,131,5.285714285714286
5593701,5,B00BEIYNIW,"In a genre that is flooded with remakes and continuations (yes, Im looking at you PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise!), its very refreshing to see a unique take on an existing staple.  With YOURE NEXT, director Adam Wingard turns the home-invasion sub-genre on its ear and takes the whole concept in a completely different direction.  The result is a well-made and very satisfying trek into terror.

The home-invasion idea is one that truly terrifies me, probably because it actually happens in real life.  Whereas most slasher-flicks are a bit on the unrealistic side, home-invasion films like THE STRANGERS are based on events that can and do make headlines every week.  This context is what makes YOURE NEXT such a horrifying premise.

YOURE NEXT is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  The production value looks high, and it seems no expense was spared to make this film realistic.

I am particularly impressed with the special effects.  Theres plenty of gory fun to go around, and it is all practical; theres no CG here!  The Making Of documentary in the Special Features reiterates this a couple of times, and the efforts of the special effects team are well worth it.  The carnage looks great, which only enhances the terror presented onscreen.

The acting in YOURE NEXT is very good as well.  Beautiful and talented Australian actress Sharni Vinson heads a stellar cast that also includes screen veteran Rob Moran and horror icon Barbara Crampton.  The actors mesh well and convey a realistic screen presence as a whole.

YOURE NEXT is a hell of a horror thriller, and I highly suggest giving it a look.  The film has garnered accolades from many critics and film festivals alike, so that should tell you something.  The film hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1388966400,,1778,4.912751677852349

5593794,4,B00BEIYNIW,Watched this the other night and it was pretty good. A lot of these dinner party horror movies are being made right now like among friends and would you rather. This all centers on a rich family that lives out in the middle of nowhere in a huge house. The whole family shows up for a get together and one of the brothers brings his new girlfriend along to meet the family. It does not take long for the tension to start as the parents are the first to arrive. They come home to the front door half open and the mother is freaked out and thinks someone is in the house. She is played wonderfully by barbara crampton a horror movie veteran from the eighties.

5593795,3,B00BEIYNIW,"The trailer for Youre Next gives the impression that this movie is a slasher-film and little else. That does the film a disservice. You're Next has a lot more to offer.

Initially, I wanted to compare You're Next to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes, which I think falls more into the Action & Adventure category than its usual description of horror. The Hills Have Eyes is simply a battle story. Like any battle story, you have two sides, they fight, there are casualties on both sides, the end. Its simple but done right, amounts to a satisfying thrill ride, an entertaining film, but nothing more.

Youre Next does that formula one better by adding in some mystery. Exactly why is this home invasion happening? Who are these dudes in the masks? In addition to the ever-present hope to see the innocent victims survive, you want to know why they are fighting.

Another surprise addition is the humor, and not cheesy slapstick, either, but genuinely clever dialogue relevant to making the people under siege seem like a typical family. The final cliche that gets blasted is the concept of the attractive young lady screaming for help and generally being little more than eye candy. This film pays homage to horror and action, but avoids the cliches.

The acting was a bit stilted at times, and the mother of the family looked far too young to be a matriarch. Minor complaints aside, this film won't leave you thinking for days, but its definitely entertaining.

5593905,1,B00BEIYNIW,"To make a film is really hard, to make an average film is ludicrously hard and to make a great film is a MIRACLE!!! Been around the Hollywood ""BIZ"" all my life and involved with it from the writing, to the making, to the sound, and on and on and I know. When a film like this gets made, it probably had greater written material, but who knows. Sadly, it gets an easy ""F"" for it's use of already used plot scenarios and on and on. But no one is to blame if they know the Hollywood machinery of making films. Only a few of anything great has ever made it's indelible immortal mark and it will always be that way.
Hollywood or The Music Biz or whatever creative situations delivered to any one of us will always try to profit from greatness, but achieve mediocrity or worse at best because of profits as their motive to create. What amuses me is that no matter how much ""They"" think they can reproduce from a ""Hit"" film the same quality over and over again from the same dilapidated plot, FX, etc... and make a gigantic profit this way or they can quantify profits with their ""Bean Counter"" ideas of how to produce films for profit or etc... people still get irate about or bothered because of the result of the usual riffraff that gets made. Most get what's being written here, ""They"" (Hollywood, etc...) always lose, especially in the end. There are many who probably don't believe this, but history has proven this time and time again.
Does mediocrity win? Ya, sure... Every dog has his/her day. But so what. The God Father, etc... is still what most of us want.
The miracle of great art whether it be Beethoven or a great Horror ""Slasher"" movie happens because of elements no one can control, ever! I only wish I could see a great fill every time I rent one, but that's an absurd hope because I know that it'll happen when the time is right, all the elements fuse together by some miracle to make something truly great and that's that. Meanwhile, I pay for a rental here on Amazon never knowing if I'll ""hit"" something great. It's a gamble and a risk I'm willing and gratefully can take, because, Thank God, sometimes it pans out.
My/Our expectations of greatness all the time is the problem, not the process of making it.
Peace Ya'll,

After having watched it, however, I could not get the smile off of my face. There were so many things that have been done before, but so rarely have I seen a movie that takes what has been done and ups the ante, and not once was I left bored or wondering about plot holes. This is the epitome of an entertaining film, and despite some questionable acting, the characters were devilishly sinister, and I was actually rooting for the protagonist as she actually made pretty solid decisions, throughout. Overall, unless you are jaded or have poor taste in films, you can't go wrong with this movie. It was very well made in almost all regards.",1388361600,5,776,4.589928057553957

5594008,2,B00BEIYNIW,"Let me start off by saying this: I do not want my scary movies to be funny. I repeat, I do NOT want my scary movies to be funny.

This seems to be a growing issue in the horror industry. Studios are going after laughs more than screams + this really annoys me. I haven't truly been startled since The Ring (2000). That means, for 13 years, Ive been satiated. Whats missing in these movies is that psychological aspect from earlier films: Whos doing this?/Why?/Is there just one killer? Now, instead of questions, we have statements: The killer will be right behind them./The killer is -insert obvious suspect here-./Hes going to die next.

This brings me to Youre Next. It was just ok. What was built up (by marketing) to be one of the scariest films in a decade was nothing more than a bunch of genre specific cliches strung together by a thin plot line. It tried to be everything we loved: Evil Dead, Scream, The Strangers. It failed. Was it horrible? No. However, it WAS predictable, corny + disappointing.

I know its hard to think of ways to shock viewers in 2013, but it can be done. Studios should demand better.",1388275200,6,1119,4.502463054187192

5594011,5,B00BEIYNIW,"I loved this movie! I think its Genius to take so many cliches and make them so fresh and entertaining.
Of course the movie was taken to a whole other level with Sharni Vinson At the helm as Erin the visiting girlfriend trained until the age of fifteen on a survivalist compound!

Everything works to its advantage ,be it the music the camera work or the dialogue,the dialogue is done in such a brilliant way because you can take it how you want to take it,its definitely subjective because some will take some that is meant to be a bit campy,seriously and vice versa. One of my favorite lines (got any Vicodin? Asked by one of the brothers to his wife. Yeah in my purse, she replies) I guess Vicodin are the new Tylenol!

The further we get into the movie the more we get slapped in the face with what we should have known from jump which is another reason its so brilliant because you really don't expect it!
The gore was pretty plentiful and well done,mostly all good old fashioned practical effects save one or two. There was one kill that I found to be a bit over the top which depending whom you ask either gives it a boost or cheapens it,think the microwave in the Last House remake!

The third act is full speed ahead never giving us a chance to catch our breath and in my opinion that's a great thing.its action packed until the very last frame.buy it because you will want to view it more than twice.",1388102400,,1410,4.333333333333333
5594012,5,B00BEIYNIW,"I keep reading a lot of one-star reviews here from folks who complain about the lack of gore and less than amazing special effects...  or the ""cheap"" looking camera work.  Those people are missing the entire point of this movie.

First of all, the camera work is done the way it is in order to convey a sense of disorientation.  It's the same reason the killers wear masks...  the audience is never allowed to get comfortable or be 100% sure that disaster doesn't lurk around the next corner.

As far as the gore and special effects...  this isn't a slasher movie, folks.  If people started spewing blood across the room, getting cut in half from head to crotch or sucked into a woodchipper the entire premise becomes a big joke.  People don't die like that in real life.  They get shot in the head and die with a bit of blood seeping out. Or they get stabbed and bleed out almost entirely internally.",1387843200,,901,4.47239263803681

I made the mistake of seeing this in the theater and couldn't wait until it was over, only hoping it would get better by the end.
The acting is ATROCIOUS, the kills are soooo LAME, and the gore is pretty much strawberry jelly smeared on the actors, not to mention the lame attempt at a TWIST ending, which Myself and everyone in the theater saw coming in the first 10 minutes!
The film makers should be banned from making movies and go back to making lame short films for V/H/S and ABC's of Death franchises!

What follows is somewhat different, however, as the intruders have to deal with a person that is far better at doing what they are supposed to do.

Story wise, Youre Next is not very original, but director Adam Wingard keeps the story moving with nice scares, gory deaths and some dark humor that arrives in most unexpected way. The films touch, as well as its moody photography and score, may remind you of the 80s horror movies. (Barbara Crampton of Stuart Gordon-directed Re-Animator appears in a cameo role.)

How anyone enjoyed this is a complete mystery. I have no issue with no name actors doing films. It's nice to see new people and so many times it's better. However there does need to be one thing that they need. THE ABILITY TO ACT!!!! It's cringe worthily every time they open their mouths. They clearly had no one to do special effects too so when there was a kill scene, all they did was shake the camera like crazy. I've seen plenty of shorts and no budget movies that work with what they have and do an amazing job. My dog could have created better effects. It was also so simple to pick up who was involved with what. I won't ruin it if you want to bother watching this garbage but I suggest Netflix or get a friend to buy it so you don't waste the money.

The cast led by Sharni Vinson (as Erin), Nicholas Tucci (as Felix), Wendy Glenn (as Zee), AJ Bowen (as Crispin), Joe Swanberg (as Drake), Sarah Myers (as Kelly), Amy Seimetz (as Aimee), Ti West (as Tariq), Rob Moran (as Paul) & Barbara Crampton (as Aubrey) is great. The directing by Adam Wingard (also did the music & film editing) is great. The story & screenplay by Simon Barrett (also produced & played Tiger Mask) is great.

The music by Wingard, Mads Heldtberg, Jasper Justice Lee & Kyle McKinnon is great. The film editing by Wingard is great. The cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo is great. The casting by Michelle Morris is great. The production design by Thomas S. Hammock is great. The art direction by Nathan Trusedell is great. The set decoration by Lanie Faith Marie Overton, set dressings by Chelsea Turner is great. The costume design by Emma Potter is great. The special effects & make-up supervised by Mike Strain Jr. & Brooke Thompson is great. The stunts coordinated by Clayton J. Barber is great.

This is a great and entertaining blend of horror & sometimes, comedy, that is interesting and different. It is also well-made and well-done. Sharni Vinson leads an interesting cast of performers, playing their characters solidly. Adam Wingard & Simon Barrett have made their most mainstream horror film together, to date, thus far.

It was so nice seeing Barbara Crampton and Ti West in this! Big fan of both! I appreciated the comic elements, but the movie is still VERY scary. Old school throw back! There is lots of blood and gore, but the plot is so over the top that it becomes comical. I will definitely be getting this movie on Blu-Ray. And, it possible, the soundtrack! By the way, I feel I should mention that even though this is a home invasion movie with bad guys in masks, it is NOTHING like The Strangers or The Purge.
