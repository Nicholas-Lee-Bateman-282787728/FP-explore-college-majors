8581775,5,B006WCGE4G,"The short film was not what I expected, of course I didn't know quite what to expect either.  The first-comer, Colten Hooker was spot on playing the awkward and mischievous Harry, a demon who lives amongst angels in the Mormon town of St. George, Utah.  The film follows a TV crew as they document a day in the life of Harry.  The subtle humor made me chuckle more and more on repeated viewings.  The sound was very professional, not to mention the stellar camera work.  The production team behind this short video really went above and beyond. I really loved the film.",1327104000,,569,4.53921568627451
