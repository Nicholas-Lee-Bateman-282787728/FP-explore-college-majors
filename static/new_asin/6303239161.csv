However, concerning humans being evil, mean wicked and nasty:) I think the point is driven a little hard.",1299628800,,265,4.659574468085107
7841864,5,6303239161,"The only movie I could probably compare this to is Disney's ""Fantasia"".  The story really isn't the beauty of it.  It's a sweet enough story that focuses around a tiny squirrel and the forest fairies and whatnot fighting against humans trying to destroy the forest they live in.  The story is an environmentalist's dream.  The entire animation peice is written and animated to Tchaikosky's 4th Symphony.  Although it was created and animated entirely in Japan, there isn't a trace of it in the animation.  It takes all the major American animation styles from the past, and uses one once for each movement of the symphony.  The animation styles may be old (like McCay and Disney), but everything about movement and backgrounds is done so beautifully (much better than American animators ever did).  It's not rated, and suitable for all audiences.  But as a former kid, I'd say that younger children wouldn't find it very interesting for long (there isn't any dialogue at all, only music).  No explosions, no Ninja Turtles, just a moving story to beautiful music, animated with amazing skill.  This is one of my absolute favorite videos ever.  It's a must have for fans of art, fans of animation, fans of Japanese anime, fans of classical music... basically anybody.",977184000,5,1265,4.943127962085308
