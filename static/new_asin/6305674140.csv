1057846,1,6305674140,"An especially horrible movie. The script is awful, the directing is leaden & dreadful. The story makes no sense. Why anyone ever made this into a movie escapes me. The characters are unlikeable and their actions just don't make sense. Sutherland & Moriarity are embarassingly bad. Holly Hunter has moments but isn't at all believable.",1237248000,3,334,5.090909090909091
1057847,5,6305674140,Woman Wanted is the story of love and the need for reconciliation and understanding between a father and son and the woman who is the catalyst to that end.  All three of the main characters share a need to come to terms with the pain in their lives and move on to functionality on their own terms.  The story is beautifully told through terrific acting and the patient pacing of the film which creates a pensive mood allowing the viewer time to absorb and process the interrelationships of the characters and connect on a personal level.  I cried from about mid way through to the end as the characters continued to discover each other and change their perspectives.  Be sure to get this film on VHS.  The DVD is cut shorter and leaves out some really good material.,1144368000,11,766,4.521739130434782
1057848,4,6305674140,"All together this movie was not too bad. Kiefer Sutherland did a wonderful job directing. And as I am not a huge Holly Hunter fan I do believe that she gave a wonderful performance in this movie along with the other actors. Kiefer Sutherland proves that he can handle being an actor and director, he had the chops for both, and good for him.",1040256000,8,341,4.34375
1057849,5,6305674140,"With its focus on three compelling characters---an emotionally-repressed college professor; his troubled, rebellious son; and the warm, understanding housekeeper who comes into their lives---Woman Wanted offers a perfect showcase for three gifted actors.  Michael Moriarty gives a characteristically intelligent and sensitive performance as a man who struggles to communicate with the people he loves. Keifer Sutherland is always believable as his mercurial son.  And Holly Hunter is charming as a young woman hoping to start a new life for herself.  The actors are helped by on-the-mark direction and a literate script which blends both drama and quirky humor.",1028419200,7,661,5.724489795918367
1057850,5,6305674140,"I LOVED this movie. Michael Moriarty is so believable portraying a tidy, gentile, soft-spoken professor with tender feelings. It was lovely to watch his appreciation develop for this new lady in his house. To watch the father and son responding to this warm housekeeper is so captivating. She blessed both father and son, and herself too. We watched this movie twice in one week and plan on viewing it again. The emotions of the three characters are so real. We agreed that the ""R"" rating is appropriate for the language, but none of the scenes offended us in any way. The subtle humor of some of the scenes was a delight too. To the Michael Moriarty fans reading this review, this movie is a must-see!",1017100800,17,702,4.624
1057851,1,6305674140,"I watched this entire movie waiting...and waiting to see where it would go. It never went anywhere. I am blown away by the fact that it was ever made as a movie much less released as a video. How this woman, played by Hunter, could fall in love with a man and his son that are so unlikeable is very unlikely. I never smiled, cried or had any emotion other than being mad...mad that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this video. Of all the movies I have seen in my entire this was the worst, and I like all kinds of movies. Don't waste your time on this one.",1005436800,3,560,4.008928571428571

1057940,1,6305674140,"I NEVER watch a move 2/3 through and give-up on it.  Morality's acting is flat and robotic, his character as appealing and magnetic as a doorstop.  Hunter's acting is disastrously too chirpy and cheerful to turn on anyone.  Sutherland's overacts to a staggering degree.  Not a character to cheer for, no tension building, no nothing.  I believe, no, I am certain that I could direct the movie without any plot changes or even dialogue changes to make it into a meaningly, mature story of three people who are suffering all in their different worlds and all sympathetic characters - at least until the end of the last third of the movie where it suddenly changes into a comedy and I no longer could tolerate it.  A total waste of time. If you don't believe me,

1058176,4,6305674140,"I'm a big fan of just about anything BBC, many Canadian series and films, and some of the more old fashioned series and films such as Downtown Abbey, Poirot, Mulder, etc ... While this wasn't BBC or Canadian, it has a more old fashioned feel. If you like these types of shows as well, this might appeal to you.

In the movie, ""Woman Wanted"", directed brilliantly directed by Keifer Sutherland (who also plays the son, Wendall), Holly Hunter  plays Emma, and Michael Moriarty plays Wendell's father, Richard.

Emma answers an ad for a ""Woman Wanted for housekeeping duties ... "". Emma answers the ad by phone, speaking with the owner of a big old home, Dr Richard Goddard. Goddard reveals that the home, is occupied by himself, as well as his 20-something year old son, Wendell. He tells Emma the home needs to be put in order, which is why he's seeking a live-in housekeeper.

During one of their easrly conversations, Emma revrals to Richard that she was previously married to an actor, who left her a man. Despite the fact that Emma's been abandoned by a man she truly loved, she decides to move on with her life, instead of becoming ""a statistic"".

Emma is highly energetic, pulling the old house together rather quickly with a lot of cleaning, some no-nosense boundaries, and wonderful cooking skills.

Wendall and Richard both become enamored of Emma. However, Wendell is highly immature, and initially ruffles Emma's feathers. Richard, who is a professor, is a very well-spoken and engaging man. Albeit quite a bit older than Emma, they seem to be a good match.

Emma is a lovely woman, young, devout, honest, caring, and beautiful. It's easy to see why they both fall for her.

Wendell resents his father because he feels his father never loved his mother, who was manic-depressive, i.e. bi-polar, and sick for much of their marriage.  Richard had her committed to a sanatorium, which is where she died, and Wendell never forgives his father for that, or his subsequent abandonment.

Wendell, who's in his late 20's, seems to be stuck at a younger age, often acting out with fits of temper (which he calls ""seizures"") when he doesn't get his way.  It looks as if Wendell might have inherited his mother's illness to some degree.  Initially, Emma can't seem to say or do anything right, but she's tough, not backing down when Wendell behaves badly.

There's another housekeeper who comes once  week, Lydia. An older woman who tells Emma she ""doesn'ts bends"", meaning she can't get down to mop floors. Apparently, Lydia has been with the family a long time because he informs Emma that he loves Lydia, so she better get along with her .. but not in a terribly polite manner. Emma tells him she's ignoring his rude and uncalled for comments - she has no preconceived notions regarding Lydia.  There's another housekeeper next door who quickly befriends Emma ... I can't remember her name.

Wendell runs around in shorts, shirts, and sweater vests, which exemplifies his immaturity, while Richard's manner is kind, caring, and highly communicative with Emma. Richard quickly falls in love with Emma, and she with him.

Wendell, who's also in love with Emma runs off to his girlfriend, Monica, and marries her in a fit after Emma reads his poetry, and doesn't respond the way Wendell wants or expects. When he returns with his new wife, Monica, he tells her she's not allowed in his room, he can't cohabitate because that's where he writes. Monica is highly distraught at not being allowed in Wendell's room, Wendell retreating to his room, and not speaking with anyone. The two quickly get an annulment after Wendell admits to Richard and Emma that he's in love with Emma.  After his pronouncement, Richard and Emma tell Wendell they're in love - which, of course, sends Wendell into another fit, but he recovers quickly as Emma sets out to help him become published.

It's a sublime, somewhat dark portrayal of two very different and separate people - the scholarly father and immature son, who are brought together by a beautiful young woman who cares deeply for both of them, and works to try to bring them together. Things don't go as planned, and the circumstances that unhinge the relationships, bring an unexpected joy for Emma, who ends up in another place without Richard or Wendell.

I LOVE Holly Hunter and would watch just about anything she plays a part in. I also like Kiefer Sutherland, who really hit my radar after watching 24. Michael Moriarty, who I've always enjoyed watching, and has been a part of SO MANY really wonderful movies and TV series. Some of the TV series include:  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - which I LOVE, as well as Law & Order, The Librarians, and The New Outer Limits.  He has SO many movie credits, some of which include: Report to the Commissioner - an excellent action packed film. Pale Rider with Clint Eastwood.  Inglorious Basterds - a brilliant film if you like WWII &/or have a disdain for Nazi war crimes.  Neighbors with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Tino Insana - who looks a wee bit like William Shatner, & Cathy Moriarty, no relation from what I've gleaned. Jarhead with Jake Gyllenhall , Soapdish with Sally Field and Kevin Kline,  Matin&eacute;e with John Goodman and Cathy Moriarty, Kindergarten Cop with Arnold Schwarzenegger,  Suspect Zero with Ben Kingsley, The Boost with James Woods and Sean Young, and Courage Under Fire with Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan.

This is a good film. Probably not for everyone, but if you enjoy the actors in his movie, you might enjoy ""Woman Wanted"".",1457308800,3,5548,4.800420168067227

1058243,2,6305674140,"Slow-paced dramedy, weighed down by unlikeable people making unlikeable choices. It took a while for me to warm up to any of the characters, although it did happen a bit as some of their motivations and histories were discussed, then each would do something completely vile, and what little feeling I had for them would ebb away. Unfortunately, the very end had been spoiled via another person's review, but- quite frankly- I probably would have hated it even more had I not known what was coming. Nothing heartwarming or inspirational, and no character growth whatsoever. The only bright spots in the whole thing was the scant couple of scenes that featured Gracie, the maid from next door, and the New England setting.  I'm astounded this irksome movie has as many 5 star ratings as it does. Don't waste your time unless you enjoy watching petulant, self-centered brats, interacting with emotionally cold, self-centered brats.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the subtitles currently available on the streaming version are decidedly subpar. I don't know if an individual captioned it, or if it was done with a voice-to-type technology, but someone REALLY should have gone back over it and corrected the many distracting errors. For example, the words ""theatre as"" was captioned as ""the Etta Rose,"" ""bourgeousie"" was captioned as ""bushwazee,"" ""stomped"" was captioned as ""stunt,"" and ""ally"" was captioned as ""Alli,"" as in the weight loss drug. It would be laughable, if it weren't so sad.

Holly on the other hand was dead on as a divorced woman trying to create a new life for herself in what can only be described as a man's household.  Michael Moriarty give a good performance as well.  I must say that I was a little disappointed with the way the film ended and I thought that they could have gone in a different direction but I guess they ended it as they saw fit but I think it could have been so much more.

1058439,2,6305674140,"*SPOILER ALERT* SORRY. But I just gotta say...how does a housekeeper who ends up sleeping with both the father and the son in the household end up being the hero of the movie?? She gets pregnant by...well geez, I guess she doesn't know, since she slept with both guys. So now the baby grows up not knowing if the Moriarty's character is his/her father or grandfather...and whether Keifer's character is his/her brother or father...what a freakin' mess! Some fairy-tale ending that is!!!

And what's with the original housekeeper being kept on? I don't get that. ""She'll be over to help with the heavy lifting."" Why can't SHE be the live-in housekeeper, and do all the work herself like any normal housekeeper? Did I miss something there? The family loves her and has used her for years, anyway. If she were industrious enough to do all the housework herself, they wouldn't have needed to hire hot-looking Hunter's character in the first place and would have thereby avoided all this mess and the illegitimate birth of ""their"" baby...sheesh. What a stupid story!

The acting is the movie is good..hence two stars...but the story is ridiculous. THUMBS DOWN.

7892766,3,6305674140,"I do think that the acting and entire production of the movie was quite good but for me, it was the callousness of the lead character played by Holly Hunter that caused me not to like the movie. Spolier alert. As the movie progresses we are unsure if Emma's developing feelings for the son played by Keifer Sutherland, or the father played by Michael Moriarty. The director makes us lean towards Kiefer. So when the father comes home and seduces Emma so suddenly it seems inauthentic. I got the feeling she would have fallen for whichever of them happened to walk into her room that night.
But then we are led to believe through the dialogue with the three of them when Kiefer comes home after getting married that this romance had been blossoming for a while. I only saw it on the father/Moriarty's part. Nothing at all from Emma to indicate any feelings for him.
Then later in the movie she seduces/lets herself be seduced by Keifer just after deciding to coldly leave Moriartys character without any explanation as to why. We knew why. It was because she suddenly got the idea that he would never have a baby with her. but why not talk it out? It was like she just heard Kiefer mention his opinion and then just like that she calmly decides to leave without any thought for Moriartys feelings. And again zero emotions emitted from Emma.
My problem with that entire sequence was the fact that right after sleeping with the son she goes to pick the father up, telling Kiefer she was going to tell him what they had done and to be there when she got back. He clearly didn't want the confrontation. Since she had already decided to leave and had packed her suitcase before the seduction scene I don't understand why she wouldnt have just left after she slept with him. Had him go pick his father up and agree never to say anything.
Knowing that Kiefer was reliant on his father for money and a home plus the fact that their relationship would be ruined. It wasn't as if she were going to be with Kiefer. She was leaving and never coming back. So why on her last day there intentionally destroy their family/father son relationship?
All with no feeling whatsoever. Yet at no time in the movie did she ever raise her voice, get angry, do spiteful things. It was just during these sexual situations where she became void of anything human really. But there was nothing prior to it in the movie to back it up. So it didn't seem an authentic part of her personality.
And in the end we are supposed to be left with the idea that she had her baby and it was some sort of womens empowerment to destroy the lives of two men who had never harmed her in any way. Just so she could have a baby independently? Yay,boo rah for womens lib or something? I thought it sucked. If it had been badly acted, and filmed I'd have given it one star but i had to give it three because of the overall production and because i know the majority of people will probably eat it right up.",1480896000,,2957,4.397810218978102
