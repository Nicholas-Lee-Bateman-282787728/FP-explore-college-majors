8264466,5,6300251551,"i can't for the life of me figure out why i've now owned no less than three copies of this 1985 direct to video classic. originally purchased for $2 on VHS at my local mom and pop video store back years ago, i found myself unable to stop watching.

that said, i am not one of those people like the movie's director who is trying to put a nice face on this incompetent, meandering piece of beta dirge. to listen to him on the commentary track, still nigh upon two decades later he is convinced that, while the movie was not without its shortcomings, it was still a good effort. wrong. everything about this movie is terrible from top to bottom. despite a 90 minute run-time, any moderately competent editor could have distilled this down to a brisk nine minutes without sacrificing key dialogue, crucial scenes or moments of ""terror"".

high points include hilariously bad dialogue overdubs, the artist's rendering of the dog symbol on the trinkets (maybe the make-a-wish foundation was on set to help?), the butterball daughter's fumbled lines (does christopher lewis know how to say ""cut""?), first rate D-actor scream performances from victim #2 and the blue-plate-special-anna-coke cafeteria cashier, oh man oh man. i could go on but you're still reading this instead of immediately purchasing this item with the fastest possible shipping option.

grab some finger salad and enjoy.",1144108800,6,1382,4.92274678111588
8264467,4,6300251551,"It seems that there is someone on a college campus killing girls by dismemberment and leaving only one clue in the crime scene: a golden amulet with a dogs head on it. The local sheriff is up for re-election and the only sure way to win is to solve the murders. Is the long-dead cult Caninus behind the evil doings? And if so, why?
BLOOD CULT isn't scary. It's pretty gory. You got to hand it to the actors: if they hammed it up anymore, an Easter dinner could be served to the crew.

8264468,1,6300251551,The is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER!  There is no way one could understand how bad this movie is.  If you just need a reference to base all other bad movies on this is the bottom of that list.  Please for the Love of Marr do not buy this movie.,1024185600,3,243,3.7254901960784315
8264469,1,6300251551,"(...)This is probably the biggest piece of (...) that i have ever seen. Why do they wanna torture us with this (...).
I just got this one. I come from Norway and i love horror, even if it`s bad horror. But this! The director should be ashamed of himself. It`s not even shot on film.  When i read about the movie the review said that it kicked ass, with plenty of gore and suspence.  I get more scared by watching ""Home Alone"".
Buy and see this one, and you`ll know what i am talking about.",1007424000,3,489,4.136842105263158
8264470,5,6300251551,"Blood Cult is the greatest horror movie of all time...I mean,the total gratuitous violence and gore,the totally cheesy shower killing,which rips off about 4 horror movies in one scene...This movie is awesome...Everyone and their dog should own a copy of Blood Cult.",995587200,5,265,5.333333333333333
8264471,5,6300251551,"BLOOD CULT is back! The infamous story about a cult follower who kills co-eds and takes a body part from them. So horrific not even the fat police chief can figure this out. Some of the most graphic murders are in this movie like a co-ed who gets smacked around with her boyfriend's severed head! Not to be missed but BLOOD CULT is not for the squeemish! Finally, BLOOD CULT is on DVD with a commentary by director Christopher Lewis (REVENGE, THE RIPPER) and the music editor and special FX man! BLOOD CULT was released in 1985 by ""UNITED HOME VIDEO"" and is 80 minutes long. BLOOD CULT is followed by REVENGE which found its way to video and DVD after being OOP since 1986. HERE IS THE BASIC INFO:
""ONE OF THE STRANGEST CRIMES IN RECOREDED HISTORY TOOK PLACE ON A SMALL, MID-WESTERN CAMPUS. EACH TIME THE KILLER STRUCK, HE MUTILATED HIS VICTIM, LEAVING A GOLDEN AMULET NEAR THE BODY. THE SHERIFF WAS BAFFELED BY THE STRING OF SERIAL STYLE MURDERS.
THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER IS NOW GOING TO UNCOVER THE CRIMES IN A BLOOD BATH CALLED ""BLOOD CULT""!",995414400,5,1042,4.518518518518518
8264472,2,6300251551,"Yah... right. Blood Cult was, well, to be kind, an morbidly entertaining film. Nothing spells artist freedom like one girl being beaten to death my a killer wheeleding her friends decaptitated head. Thats quality with a ""K""! Umm.. hmm... Super cheesey death scene's. Poor blood effects. Oh, the Sheriff is classic (right...). Hmm... ok, well thats all the postive things I could come up with. (Note: none of my comments retained to a powerful story line or amazing acting. There is a reason for that.) Now, after all that. I think its safe to say if you rent Blood Cult, you should be slapped with a wet fish.",985219200,,609,4.648148148148148
8264473,3,6300251551,"This is a ""better than agerage"" low budget slasher flick from the mid 80's.  The story rervolves around a college town sheriff tracking a ""witch cult"" that keeps killing college students.  The sheriff's  daughter and the local doctor help him with the case, but are they really  helping him at all?  There are many leads and twists in this movie that  keep you wondering and the end is not what you would expect.  You may need  to watch it a couple of times to really get it.  worth checking out.  And  I'm not saying that just because it was filmed in my neck of the woods,  I've given many a bad movie made here my honest opinion.",950572800,2,632,4.3076923076923075
