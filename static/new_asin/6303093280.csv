i also would like to petition that as well as what i said just now about the three volumes i mentioned

if anyone likes my idea about double dare pvds and dvds ,

please respond

so two seperate things can happen

1] someone would have to write a letter to videonow asking them

to get double dare on their list of pvd's

 as well as puting those three vhs volumes into dvds

and

2] as for the complete seasons of double dare

i think that if anyone would appreciate a dvd set

and add making of featurettes about how they made those physical challenges

thank you",1102032000,2,1014,4.253968253968254

SSM features the best moments of messy physical challenges, sloppy obstacle courses, and more.  This video is extremely short (30 mins.) but the box says its 55 min's.

Nevertheless, when it come to game shows made for kids, they always seem to come and go that quickly. However, there are two game shows made for kids that really stood the test of time, Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?, and the other is Double Dare. Double Dare was originally a game show back in the 1970's, hosted by Alex trebek. However, the game was remade into a fantastic game for kids of all ages. With Marc Summers on board, the game became a huge smash with Nickelodeon, and people from all over the country. The game show lasted with Summers from 1986-1993, making it the longest-running game show for kids in history. This video highlights the triumphs Double Dare had for all kids.
Double Dare: Super Sloppiest Moments, is a featured anthology reflecting their biggest moments within two incarnations of the game show: Super Sloppy Double Dare, and Family Double Dare. The 30 minute video shows clips of some of the most exciting and humorous moments the game show endured throught its length in television. In the video, there are so many hints of gak and excitement going through the obstacle course. The video also shows a behind-the-scenes look at when it does come to messes that are made, how complex, but understaning it is to clean the mess up, and start a new game anew. The game showcased a lot more with some of the physical challenges that were made, including stunts involving Breakfast In Bed, tossing TV Guides to get food to land on your family, and even some of the most unexpected moments ever, including seeing the host Marc Summers get slimed and even gakked up in the process. Even on the street, Summers also asked kids what they liked the most about Double Dare, many people agreed, it was the obstacle course.
Unfortunately, it is just a shame that Double Dare is no longer on Nickelodeon anymore. They did try Double Dare again in a short-lived version called Double Dare 2000, with a different host, Jason Harris. Although it seemed like it was alright, it failed to connect like the original one that they guy from Indianapolis, Indiana made it, Marc Summers. Although Summers did come back to the game show field with History I.Q. for The History Channel, it failed to connect with all ages. Marc Summers will always be known as the Gak-meister from Double Dare. Hopefully, the show will comeback, and do better than ever.",1049587200,,2488,4.6826484018264845
7837226,4,6303093280,"I got this video off of E-BAY after reading about it on Joe's Double Dare page, and I must say that it is a blast from the past. They only showed 3 clips from the 1986 version (2 from the past & present section, and 1 at the very end), and most were from either the 1989 Super Sloppy Double Dare, or the 1990/1992 Family Double Dare. The bloopers are great, and the courses were a blast, but they should have also added some of the memories (""Nightmare"" episode (the 2nd 1986 DD clip in the video is from that episode!), Harvey VS Marc, etc). I also think that it should be longer, but other than that, it is GREAT. On your mark, Get Set, GO!",1047945600,,642,4.103174603174603
