There is kind of a sad ending to the series though, leaving a lot unexplained.  Some say that the series is complete, but I think they planed on having a lot more personally.  Oh ya, and good job on the prompt delivery.  It was in good condition too :)",1290556800,,352,4.132352941176471
8254459,3,B0014567WU,"The storyline escalates in epic action & adventure with the introduction of the Chaos Emeralds & the potential power they possess. The Sonic Team must find these Chaos Emeralds before their enemies abuse the power of the Chaos Emeralds & threaten the world with weapons of mass devastation. The plot has corrected itself in pace & development because the pace is well suited for the increase in urgency within the storyline of the anime series. The dialogue is more evolved in expressing the emotions & thoughts of the characters at specific moments during the progression of the storyline, but still needs some more improvement.
The voice acting has improved significantly in portraying the personalities of the characters & have corrected the lethargic action-reaction issue to make the characters seem more lively.
I would make this anime series optional for anime fans. There are still some problems with the reshuffling of the scenes & the edits by 4Kids Entertainment.
Thank you.",1287100800,,985,5.1625
8254460,5,B0014567WU,"I'm a big fan of the old sonic series of shows, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Sonic-the-Hedgehog/dp/B000N2HDLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>&nbsp;and so, when I grew up, this show came out and I was intrigued, because I loved the old videos games and everything. I never heard of this show, but I found it to be quite good. Other than giving Sonic too much attitude at times, it was funny and interesting to watch. It's a lot different that the other Sonic, but I recommend it.",1284768000,,578,5.892857142857143

8254465,4,B0014567WU,"Okay, I need to clear something up as an interesting FYI: whether or not this is the complete second season depends on whether or not you're judging it by the American system.  If you read my review on the previous Sonic X season, the New World Saga, you may recall that I ranted and raved about it not being the complete first season, amazon claimed.  Technically, I was correct; but I was also wrong at the same time.  By Japanese standards, this is the last half of the first season; but by American standards, this is the complete second season.  You see, Japan split up the episodes into three seasons; if you look on websites that hold records of Sonic X, you'll notice this is the most common format for the listings of the episodes; therefore, it's easy to get confused on what's really the complete first/second season of Sonic X.  This confusion cleared up when someone mentioned the difference: America split the same show up into six seasons.  I was unaware of this at the time I made my Sonic X New World Saga review, and I don't like editing my old reviews so I'm stating this now: this is the complete second season by American standards.  If you base this upon Japanese standards, this is the last half of the first season (the first half is the New World Saga; check it out!)  Does that make sense?

Now that that's cleared up, I can comment directly on the DVD.  You get a total of thirteen episodes: ""That's What Friends Are For,"" ""Skirmish In The Sky,"" ""Depths Of Danger,"" ""Adventures Of Knuckles And Hawk,"" ""The Dam Scam,"" ""Sonic's Scream Test,"" ""Cruise Blues,"" ""Fast Friends,"" ""Little Chaos Lost,"" ""Emerald Anniversary,"" ""How To Catch A Hedgehog,"" ""A Dastardly Deed,"" and ""Countdown To Chaos.""  This DVD set doesn't contain bonus features (aside from advertisements).  Now, I'll tell you a little bit about each episode using a scoring scale of 1-10 (1 being the lowest, ten being the highest) and I'll finish by giving the overall good and bad about the product.  Let's get started:

""That's What Friends Are For"" 10/10: A sweet, cute, and slightly humorous episode.  Sonic meets and befriends a girl named Helen, who is bound to a wheelchair.  She wants to go to a small island in the middle of a lake that is just off a Station Square Highway.  Her parents don't have time to take her, so Sonic promises to take her instead.  The twist to this tale is that the President's Aide makes Sonic the guest of honor to a party that he and the President are holding; this collides with the same day Sonic promised to take Helen to the lake.  Sonic won't break a promise, but the President's aide is insistent (meaning sending military troops and the like) that he be there; what will happen?  *I've already seen all of these episodes, but I will not give spoilers.

""Skirmish In The Sky"" 8/10: In this funny but later fight crazy episode, Sonic and friends are finally allowed to leave Chris' home for a day on the town; how will they adjust being celebrities?  It also turns out that Eggman was never truly defeated!  As he retaliates, can Sonic stop the enemy that threatens to destroy the city again?

""Depths Of Danger"" 9/10: This episode is pretty funny, and not as battle crazy as ""Skirmish In The Sky.""  Sonic and friends go to Sapphire Ocean to enjoy a relaxing vacation; instead, they discover that a chaos emerald is in the ocean.  Since water is Sonic's weakness, how will Chris manage to get him underwater for the search?  And is Eggman truly defeated, or is he lurking somewhere waiting to attack again?

""The Adventures Of Knuckles And Hawk"" 9/10: A comedic and interesting episode.  We find out what's going on with Knuckles.  While exploring a southern continent, Knuckles encounters and rescues a man who is later known as Hawk.  It turns out they are both looking for the same thing: a chaos emerald.  Hawk finds out that Knuckles is searching for the emeralds in order to get home, and offers his full cooperation in the matter; but others are after the emerald as well.  Who will get the precious gem first?

""The Dam Scam"" 7/10: This sort of funny but villain crazy episode, involves Sonic, Tails, and Chris flying over a Safari.  They are attacked by Eggman and Tails' plane crashes.  Tails repairs the ship, while Sonic explores.  When Tails finishes the repairs, he and Chris discover shady men building a dam that could hurt the environment; can Tails and Chris stop them?  Meanwhile, Eggman sends an ape-like robot to hunt down Sonic; will Eggman find and destroy Sonic?

""Sonic's Scream Test"" 2/10: A really lame episode.  Chris (along with everyone else) joins his mom in a movie shoot at a haunted castle, but is later kidnapped by mischievous ghosts.  Will Sonic and friends be able to rescue her?

""Cruise Blues"" 10/10: A hilarious episode.  The funniest one on the entire disc set.  Chris invites everyone on a yacht that belongs to one of his father's friends, as they travel to see some famous icebergs.  Unfortunately, nobody but Chris and his grandfather know how to relax properly, and everyone else goes berserk; especially Sonic.  Tanaka, the waiter, and a bunch of elderly people show up in order to teach the Sonic crew how to relax.  Can they learn to relax, and are they sitting ducks for a surprise attack?

""Fast Friends"" 9/10: A cool episode with good comedy.  Sam Speed, Chris' uncle, challenges Sonic to a race.  Will Sonic accept Sam's challenge?  And if he does, who will win?

""Little Chaos Lost"" 8/10: *Note*, this episode has nothing to do with Chaos, the liquid god of the chao.  It's chaos, as in multiple chao.  *End Note*
A cute and slightly humorous episode.  Chris and his friends go on a camping trip, while Sonic travels around the world.  Tanaka leads the trip, and it's all fun and games until Cream's chao, Cheese, gets lost.  Will they find Cheese?  Meanwhile, Eggman decides to go on a camping trip of his own; he spots everyone else looking for Cheese and assumes they are searching for a chaos emerald.  Will Eggman attack them?  And if he does, will Sonic be able to get to them in time to protect them?

""Emerald Anniversary"" 8/10: This episode is cool and funny, but is also fight oriented, again.  Sonic and friends (including Knuckles) have managed to obtain a total of five emeralds, meaning the last two are up for grabs.  One of them Chris' dad finds in a shop, and he buys it to give to his wife for their anniversary.  Will Sonic and friends be able to get that emerald?  Who else also wants it?

""How To Catch A Hedgehog"" 10/10: Perhaps the second funniest episode in the set.  During a battle to save Amy from one of Eggman's robots, Sonic gets a computer chip stuck in his head.  Unfortunately, this causes Sonic to react to a remote, on which Tanaka unwittingly pushes the forward button; this causes Sonic to run without being able to stop.  This episode uses dramatic irony (a literary term meaning something the audience knows, but the actors/actresses don't) to excruciating pain; as Sonic's friends try to figure out what's wrong with him.  Even Knuckles gets involved as Chuck, Chris' grandfather, devises plans to try and catch Sonic.  Will Sonic's friends succeed in capturing him?  Will Eggman take advantage of this situation?

""A Dastardly Deed"" 8/10: This episode is pretty good and E-77 is certainly cute.  Eggman's in a good mood, so he sends E-77, Lucky, to find the last chaos emerald; and maybe nab the others while he's at it.  Lucky is a relatively harmless robot but, as the name suggests, he has luck in spades.  Knuckles finds him along with Eggman's hiding place, and gets the bright idea that Sonic and Eggman need to team up in order to get home.  Chris tags along, and both he and Knuckles make a deal to work together with Eggman, in which Eggman agrees.  Is Eggman really sincere about helping them?

""Countdown To Chaos"" 8/10: An intense episode.  Eggman obtains six of the seven chaos emeralds, and uses their destructive power to power his ultimate machine.  He and Sonic duke it out, with many others involved.  Who will win?  Will Sonic and friends finally get back to their own world?

Those are the episode summaries; now for a brief the bad and the good, in that order.

Bad:

1.  Again, lots of fighting (but again, no blood; this cartoon was made so young children could see it).

2.  Cheaper animation.  Astute eyes may notice that one frame was used twice in ""Skirmish In The Sky.""

Good:

1.  Better character-background mix (in other words, you didn't see cartoon characters on a background that looked like a cheesy postcard, or cardboard cutouts).

2.  It is the most hilarious season out there.

3.  While there was still a lot of Sonic/Eggman, it wasn't annoying; they were often used as a refreshing comic relief.

4.  Great storylines.  Maybe sometimes pointless and random, but they were clearly trying to install a lot of good comedy in this season.

Conclusion:
Overall, this is a great buy that will entertain Sonic fans for several hours.  Thanks to this season, I am in great anticipation for the next one!  I close also recommending the New World Saga, because there are vague references to it in this season; but you don't absolutely have to have it to understand this one.  I just recommend it for more fun television!",1212624000,14,9275,4.661728395061728
