I could feel a connection to portals of energy called the ""nine worlds"" of the tree of life. You build a stone altar with the nine directions, bind the powers of the nine worlds (dimensions) into your body, speak the chant and then watch what happens! After my first few times doing the ritual, I had to take a break because the energy was getting too intense. Be careful what you wish for... Seriously, be careful. Know exactly what you want to manifest before doing this spell work. I now feel a constant connection to the nine worlds in my body... A must for all shamans, energy workers and Magick workers....

I could go on, but you'll just have to try it for yourself.",1383177600,9,919,4.508982035928144
