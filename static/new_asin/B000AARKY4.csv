2383865,5,B000AARKY4,"I agree with the reviewer called ""Response to the reviewer called 'Mixed Feelings'. In terms of plotline, it would seem fitting that there would have to be problems for Ed and Al in lab five. Thats the conflict isn't it? Without a conflict there's no point in writing a story, unless you like stories like that: where there are little or no conflicts and/or the characters don't die or get hurt. Personally, those are not for me. I apologize to the ""Mixed Feelings"" reviewer, but when you ask questions like that its like asking ""why does this story have conflict?""

In all I really like this series. It has twists, turns and its really unpredictable. When a story is unpredictable, you know its been done well. And the characters are full of life and heart, you can actually feel their feelings as they fight all these enemies who are greedy and want to steal everything the Elrics have and received by accident.

I've only seen a few of these episodes on TV, but so far I give it a thumbs Up! From this point on, the stroy only gets more intense and exciting. I look forward to seeing the whole DVD!",1130630400,3,1101,4.472636815920398
2383866,5,B000AARKY4,"FMA is now my favorite anime. while i don't own any of the dvds, i've seen the episodes on cartoon network's Adult Swim. These episodes are (for the most part) very dramatc. You'd better get this dvd, cuz it's leading up to amazingly-super-awesome season finale. (The last episode of season one is single handedly responsible for cementing FMA's position as my favorit anime) so in conclusion..buy this! its great",1130630400,,413,5.0
2383867,5,B000AARKY4,"This DVD has some great episodes and some fair episodes. The first two episodes on this disc (21, 22) wrap up the Lab 5 story arc, and they are among the best of the story arc IMO. As Edward questions what he is willing to do to acquire the Philosphers stone and Alphonse continues to question his own existence. A new Homunculous and some new characters make there first appearance here, though they are not seen again till about ten episodes later. Overall I was very satisfied with the wrap up of the Lab 5 story arc, and they are among my favorites. As the truly serious parts of the storyline are excellently done. Episode 23 and 24 are not the best but not bad either. Episode 23 is interestingly done, as there is a sober mood overall, yet comedy is inserted as well. It's ending is excellent though. Episode 24 was pretty good but I felt some parts of it were a tad rushed. Overall I felt that since it had to deviate from the Manga during these episodes certain differences weren't handled as well as others. I felt the conclusion of certain characters (I'll only give you one clue as to who: 6 ) was somewhat thrown together. However it is a fairly good character development episode. My only complaint about this DVD is that I wish they could have crammed the end of Season 1 (Episode 25) into it as well.",1129852800,7,1316,4.397540983606557

2383869,5,B000AARKY4,"The soundtrack to this series is AMAZING.  Simply AMAZING.  I love the first OST soundtrack that came with the first box set and I look forward to the second.

I am so thrilled with the dub of this series.  Funimation has done an amazing job with the production of the whole thing.  I have not been disappointed with the voice acting at all.

I've seen the whole series in Japanese, but STILL get excited when new ""American/English"" episodes come out.",1127952000,12,451,4.575
2383870,5,B000AARKY4,"You still have to buy the DVD's one volume at a time. The boxed sets just give you a tin storage box to keep 5 volumes in and a soundtrack CD. I have the first boxed set and plan to get this one as well. This comes with volume 6, which contains episodes 21-24. Unfortunately we'll have to wait to get episode 25, which wraps up season 2 of the show and includes a very shocking ending. The episodes on this disc are still very good and are among the most dramatic of the series.",1127260800,42,478,4.042105263157895
2383871,5,B000AARKY4,"Fullmetal Alchemist is a great show in general, but I like this dvd a lot. Out of all the animes I've seen, this is the only one I enjoy. It has drama, action, a bit of horror and comedy. This dvd also reveals a lot of things to the audience, and to the story line as well. I would at least give this dvd (and the show) a four.",1136419200,,327,3.753623188405797

2383873,5,B000AARKY4,"As Edward works his way even deeper into the 5th laboratory, he comes closer to a moral decision that could put him onto the road of darkness forever. Knowing that the creation of the Philosopher's Stone needs the death of human victims, he will have to wrestle with whether restoring Al and himself back to normal is worth the cost of innocent lives, well, actually, criminals. And Al is even questioning whether he is really himself or whether he is just Ed's memories instead of a soul. All the villains of the show are also converging on the site. The Homunculi are there for a reason and want something from Ed, while Scar is there to kill all of them in the name of his god.

Fullmetal Alchemist just keeps getting better and better. While it is heavy on action, the moral issues are pretty prominent. The fact that Ed faces conflict on whether to sacrifice the lives of prisoners for Al just shows how realistic Fullmetal is. Scar is a good anti-hero. While he has done some horrible things and engaged in wanton killing, we see what is driving him, and he has begun to evolve in the past two volumes, becoming more enlightened about the fate of his race, and the hearts of Ed and Al. It even gets a little disturbing because most of the characters, even the bad ones, are just trying to make their lives better. The problem is that you don't get something for nothing. And sometimes that cost is death. Great show",1132876800,6,1421,4.486486486486487
2383874,5,B000AARKY4,"This entire show is amazing, and this disc just tops it off.  There are so many new revelations that we find out in Vol. 6 that deepens the meaning of the show and the characters.  I have seen the entire show, and things that happen in this Vol are what really gets the ball rolling for the rest of the show.

Something amazing about Fullmetal Alchemist is its ability to for one moment be extremly funny and then in a second get serious...yet still hold its ground.  The depth of the characters, even the minor ones in th military truly make this wonderful.",1132444800,2,558,4.388349514563107
2383875,5,B000AARKY4,"Fullmetal Alchemist has been one of the best anime series I've seen. In my opinion, it tops Bebop in so many ways. Enough with my opinions. Now, this set includes the Tin Box, which has nice art, the 6th Volume of the series (which didn't have the last episode of season 1 *.*), and the 2nd soundtrack of the series, which contains the rest of the songs from the second season. It's well worth every penny, not just because it's Fullmetal, but also because of the beautiful sounds that the Moscow orchestra wonderfully put together. This is the anime series that you truly cannot miss.",1132185600,8,585,4.580952380952381
2383876,4,B000AARKY4,"To respond to the author of 'mixed feelings' and 'explanation' who claims that the homonculi were putting Al and Ed at uneccessary risk by pitting them against the chopper and the 'ensouled' armor brothers.  Go back and watch it again.  Listen to it rather than fast fowarding through the 'talking parts'.  Write down words you don't understand and then go look them up.  Take your ADD pills.  Perhaps then you will learn that the guardians of Laboratory 5 were disobeying their orders to let the boys pass.  The traps that Ed had to overcome were no real match for an alchemist of his level (and stature).

The previous 'endangerments' were tests of the boys powers and abilities.  Keep in mind that the Homonculi are manipulating the boys to their goal.  They know Ed would never sacrifice human life unless it was to save his brother, they know that they need his full will and skill to achieve their goal.  Also keep in mind that as the story progresses you see that the Homonculi are trying to maintain their shadow influence over the state and also keep their very existence a secret except to those who they wish.  Note that anyone who discovers them is soon killed as long as they serve no further purpose to them.  I believe it gives them a twisted pleasure to manipulate the humans they despise so much. They also have a much hinted at personal interest in the boys due to their father.

Also keep in mind that more secrets are being revealed about the Homonculi their goals (universal and invidual).  Its quite possible that Al and Ed are just one of several folks they have running in their maze.",1131494400,3,1608,4.5964912280701755
2383877,5,B000AARKY4,"It doesn't surprise me that people will compare what's supposedly smarter to something else that is less than intelligent, in their own vaunted opinions.  However, there are much more things at stake in terms of the entire value of the production than just mere perpetual ""who's got the bigger brain or brawn"" that I constantly see in anime today.

There is an actual sense of ethics and raw emotion as well as cold logic and brute action in Fullmetal Alchemist that other shows do not begin to touch upon.  Children lose loved ones and struggle to come to terms with their mistakes as they get older.  Older people try in vain to keep what they cannot have.  Beings beyond the realm of human understanding desire that which eludes them most-- a soul.  All this, and still FMA continues to add humor, sorrow, joy and grief to the driving action that is anime.

You cannot simply look at this from one perspective.  Compared to the likes of the older generation of shows where the bigger guns, bigger machines, bigger swords, fancy costumes and shows based solely on ""you're stupid, you have no idea what I can do to you, so I'm going to spend five minutes talking about the way I'm going to talk about the things I'm doing to you"", FMA need not compare.  It delves into a part of our own history based in THIS reality, creates a completely different fantastic world-- and manages to keep itself centered on the very notion of humanity.  The same can be said of Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex.  However, look at any other show, and you'll see exactly what's missing.  Plot.

The plot is thick in FMA.  And it always leaves you wanting more.  A sense of resolution-- be it the actualization of the plans of the Homonculi, body reunited with soul, limbs reunited with original flesh, loved ones being able to see their kin again.  Not just, ""Hey-- I'm gonna beat you so I can have the dragonball/demon shards/alter powers/super robot and rule the world until someone else comes along that I have to yell at and tell them how I'm going to beat them up for their dragonball/demon shards, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...""

Get a grip.  See THIS show.  It's worth it.",1130630400,23,2172,4.594805194805195

8077288,5,B000AARKY4,"i am hooked on this series. the problem is (as always) the ending - the movie (the Conqueror of Shamballa). i am dying to know what happens to Ed and Al once they cross the gate and no longer have alchemy to rely on. i want to know if they ever make it back across the gate, and if they don't how they adjust to all the familiar faces (but non-familiar personalities that go with them) on the side they are on currently.

8077291,5,B000AARKY4,"The moral issues presented in FMA is something you'd find in some of the more classical works of literature, not in an anime aimed at teenagers. Yet it all works as the series never gets away from the fact that it is dealing with some of the most basic concepts of being human. Hell, FMA's bad-guys are even named after the Seven Deadly Sins.

This volume continues with Ed and Al's fight within and outside the prison against creatures that are very akin to Alphonse. Eventually, though, the brother's find themselves facing off against the main antagonists of the series (the aforementioned Seven Deadly Sins). Later, Alphonse must face the fact that he's losing his memories and must also figure out a few things on his own, like whether or not he ever truly existed as the brother to Edward Elric, and what exactly it is to be human. Also, Scar takes center stage more than once in this volume in a somewhat surprising way...

FMA's ability to juggle the massive cast is brilliant. I think I can name almost every character in FMA (and for me, this is something as I'm very forgetful of names), simply because each and every character has something endearing about them. That includes the bit-players who are there simply to fill a moment of the series or to progress a specific scene ahead.

If you haven't started collecting FMA yet, then start quickly. There aren't many anime out right now that can top FMA. It has everything great anime has: great story, great characters, great music, great animation. Though it may be cliche to say this, FMA is one of the top five anime ever created, and any fan of anime would be foolish to let this slip by them.",1151798400,2,1659,4.597972972972973

If you haven't already purchased the first seven volumes in this series I have to ask why?  Fullmetal Alchemist is right up there with the greats of Anime.  You'll never find two more loveable protagonists, action, side splitting humor, and momments that just stay with you.
