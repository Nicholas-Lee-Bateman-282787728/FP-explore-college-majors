8173869,4,B000N1I7PQ,"This brief documentary explores the 100 year bloom of the Incan Culture, where it came from, how it grew, and how it ended.  It seems to be aimed at younger children (ages 5 to 9 or so) and comes complete with ""Electric company"" style special effects that do seem effective at drawing the children's attention.  It is reasonably thorough for the developmental stage it seems to be aimed at and the limited time is has to get the story across and is carefully non-committal about the encounters between the Inca and Pizzarro, without pulling any punches.  I appreciated that because it means we could discuss motivations and draw our own ethical conclusions.

I recommend this one as a good introduction. Like the entire series, it is remarkble for it's high quality reenactments.",1234742400,,779,4.878787878787879
