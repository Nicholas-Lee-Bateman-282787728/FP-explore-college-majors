8590852,4,B00D9BY2Q0,"I enjoy it very much. It's like taking a 75 minute tour of Italy. The soundtrack is pleasant -classical, Italian instrumentals. The time passes quickly.",1394150400,,152,5.12
8590853,5,B00D9BY2Q0,"THIS is the kind of riding I enjoy.  I don't want to pay $$ to view someone's rear end as we cycle through an area.  This one, like the other Bike-o-Visions, puts you out in front.  But what is special about this one is that the scenery is magnificent!  Can see why George Clooney lives here.  You always have the lake in sight; the mountains surrounding it are beautiful.  You see ppl strolling about,, nice cars pass you by.  You breeze past restaurants and hotels.  Not some lonely, dull trip staring at pavement.  Highly recommend.",1393718400,,535,4.5473684210526315
8590854,3,B00D9BY2Q0,I enjoy this video but the music quality is bad. The only Bike-O-Vision video I have bought that is like that,1391385600,2,109,4.238095238095238
8590855,5,B00D9BY2Q0,"I own a number of Bike-O-Vision DVDs and this is one of my top two favorites. There are no hills (which I like) but the scenery makes up for it. There are no stretches where the rider is bored, or the scenery could be mistaken for ""just anywhere."" Riding through these Italian towns really makes you feel like you are there. It is one of the only videos that has people in it too, and I actually give a little wave to some of them when riding past. I love this ride and it is fun to see the map at the end of each segment too.",1384300800,2,526,3.925233644859813
8590856,5,B00D9BY2Q0,"Wow!  First of all, I'm so pleased that the good folks at Bike-O-Vision finally are offering more European rides on dvd!  Years ago my husband got me the ""European Sampler"", which was very nice and I used it repeatedly many times but I had almost given up hope that there would be more European dvds ever available in this wonderful cycling format.  Well... here they are, and I'm so excited with the places I can now ""travel"".
 In this particular ""Lake Como"" disc, the narrow passages and streets through the colorful, quaint Italian lakeside towns are the main attraction, but it has a few other highlights I'll mention here to keep it brief.  The misty mountains in the background are such a contrast to the rich colors in the local architecture in the foreground, its, I guess you might say ""artistic"" or like some paintings I've seen.  The added touches- a cute, tiny little Italian girl holding huge white lilies;  a close up of a lake fish swimming, panoramas of sailboats at anchor with those incredibly foreboding mountains in the background- these images really stay in my mind forever like I was really there with the filmmakers.  Bravo Bike-O-Vision!",1374537600,5,1162,4.8040201005025125
