8017130,3,B0001WTVR0,"Some independently-made films are minor works of art with much to recommend them. Others are major missteps that only serve to remind us it's not just anybody who can turn out cinematic classics. Guess which category the  NIGHT CHILLS 10 MOVIE PACK falls under?

The pick of the litter here is probably ""Kiss Daddy Goodnight,"" which features both Uma Thurman and Steve Buscemi early in their careers. What's left is slim pickin's by most folks' standards. The hard core slash and gore aficionado will undoubtedly find something of interest in these  obscurities, however.

A very similar (and deluxe) package is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TOXIE-S-TOP-TEN-The-Collector-s-Set/dp/B000AM6OD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TOXIE'S TOP TEN The Collector's Set </a>. The ten movies in this DVD box are truly as bizarre as it gets!

8017132,4,B0001WTVR0,"NIGHT CHILLS is a 10 movie collection for guys, gals, and ghouls. Movie #1- LITTLE COREY GOREY- Poor Corey Gorey lives with his sadistic stepmother and ""Biff"", the evil stepbrother, who torture Corey for their sick amusement. Don't worry, Corey gets his revenge in a big way! Movie #2- BIRDS OF PREY- This lump of cheese features Michelle Johnson as Vanessa, a tv reporter who is sent to investigate a case of killer chickens. Her faithful cameraman is played by none-other than Christopher ""Blue Lagoon"" Atkins, who once again shows why he is such an international superstar. It seems that our fine feathered friends have decided to rise up and kill us, and only Vanessa and a mayor in a small french town can save us. This one has killer pigeons, ducks, seagulls, etc., all looking like they only want to fly out of this movie! Watch for the wire pulling the eagle, during the opening hang-glider scene! See uncooperative pigeons thrown into action by helpful hands, during the bus scene! Oh, the humanity! Movie #3- SLASHDANCE- Someone is killing the dancers of Hollywood! Can undercover cop, Tori Raines (Cindy Maranne) find the nefarious maniac before he strikes again? No, but she sure can dance! Warning! This film contains scenes of intense spandex and legwarmers! Movie #4- KISS DADDY GOODNIGHT- Uma Thurman is Laura, a girl who drugs and robs dirty old men who pick her up. Paul Dillon (yep, Matt's brother) is Sid, a guitar player who is trying to find his old singer, Johnny (Steve Buscemi) so they can put the band back together, man. Laura is pestered by William, an old guy who seems nice, but has major issues! He's obsessed with Laura because she resembles his daughter. Things get pretty creepy! Not bad. Movie #5- BROKEN SKULL- An excellent gorefest for the true splatter junkie! A guy is caught having sex with a mobsters gal, and is killed by having his head crushed in a vice. Years later, construction workers find the broken skull, and terror ensues! This is a fantastic micro-budget indie! Well worth seeing. Movie #6- IN THE LITTLE MANSION- A ghost story about a woman who has an affair with a long-winded poet, only to be smothered by her husband. She comes back from the grave and just sort of talks and talks while others mill about and talk some more. Extremely dull! Artsy and tedious. Movie #7- UNHOLY TERROR- A crazy artist (and Christopher Lee clone) makes sculptures by covering women in molten bronze. It's ""Bucket Of Blood"" without the Roger Corman humor. There's some weird religious connection to the murders, but it was still pretty goofy. I did like the dark atmosphere though. OK. Movie #8- CREEPTALES- Another good indie! An anthology of short horror quickies. First, there's WARPED about a woman who seeks revenge for an incestual rape she'd suffered in childhood. Some nice twists and decent acting. Next is SNATCHER about a punky purse-snatcher who picks on the wrong old lady and her horrific handbag from hades! THE CLOSET has a little boy, afraid of the monster in the closet, who discovers that some nightmares are real. GROOVY GHOULIE GARAGE concerns two young gentlemen who get stranded in a small town where things seem frozen in time. HOWLING NIGHTMARE is the weaker, blessedly short film about werewolf hunters. Gorey, but lame. SUCKER is my personal favorite. A traveling vacuum-cleaner salesman sells a bizarre and sinister product. This one's a lot of fun! All of these shorts are watched by a group of popcorn munching monsters in their living room. I loved it! Movie #9-MACHINE HEAD- Another indie triumph! A kid who works in his dad's mortuary decides to re-animate the dead by sticking electrodes into the brain of a corpse, and powering it with a lawnmower engine bolted to it's head! This obvious tribute to Re-Animator, Frankenstein, etc. is priceless! Movie #10- KNIGHT CHILLS- A group of role playing game enthusiasts are stalked by a murderous knight on horseback. Not bad. If you've ever played any games like this, you'll get a warm feeling. If not, it may seem awfully stupid. Well, there it is. NIGHT CHILLS offers a wide variety of horror movies for a cheap price. Belongs right next to CURSE OF THE DEAD and FRIGHT NIGHT on your DVD shelf...",1087344000,26,4215,4.823204419889502
