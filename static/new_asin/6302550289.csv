8170101,2,6302550289,"This version of A Christmas Carol is an example of how you can do everything by the book, yet strike out.  I can't put my finger on any particular mistake any made in the production of this film or the play it documents.  The acting is excellent.  The costumes and set design are excellent. The song and dance routines are excellent.  Everything about this video seems excellent to me, except the overall effect, which is that I am unlikely to ever watch it again.",1450051200,,464,4.488095238095238
8170102,5,6302550289,"The item arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  My daughter was thrilled.  This is the version of A Christmas Carol that she has watched at her grandparents' home since she was a little girl, and in her opinion, the best one ever!",1324857600,,239,4.409090909090909
8170103,1,6302550289,Perhaps it is well that this version is not available.  I have 24 different video versions of this great classic that I watch every year (as part of my Christmas tradition).  But this 90 minute theatrical version is  the hardest to watch.  It's slow moving pace and harsh performance by  Richard Hilger makes this version more of a chore than a pleasure of my  Christmas tradtion.,944265600,13,380,4.681818181818182
