8035553,5,B00030606U,"As blues and slide guitar reviewers noted, this is one fabulous musical dvd, and I feel lucky that it was available and I can listen to it over and over.

MY SUGGESTION TO AMAZON:  Please give a few simple guidelines to reviewers when you solicit reviews, including NOT to downrate a product just because you ordered the wrong thing and were shipped the wrong item, or some other misunderstanding.  A perfect example is the ridiculous 1 star review below that significantly lowers the rating and thus misleads Amazon customers and is unfair to the artists.  My 2 cents.",1482105600,,569,4.775510204081633
8035554,5,B00030606U,"Wow, what a great 80 minutes of music this is! The video quality is plain and simple (just the artist solo, or in Roulette's and Bhatt's cases with their supporting bands, on a stage with no audience), but more than adequate to show the artist's technique (lots of close-ups). I imagine this would be especially great for musicians to learn from, but it's also great for someone like me just wanting to hear the music and see the performers.

I bought this for the performances of Martin Simpson who I have been a fan of for years but never seen play live (other than on youtube), and of course he's great, but so are all the others (Bob Brozman, Feddie Roulette, Mike Auldridge and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt). And they cover a wide variety of very different styles of slide playing.

Also included (and a rare bonus for a music DVD) is the helpful and detailed booklet about the slide, these musicians, and other offerings from Vestapol Videos. My question after seeing Freddie Roulette do ""Blueberry Hill"" was who was doing that second killer solo? The liner notes let us know it's Steve Kimock.... very nice.

This is not an ""exciting"" DVD, but if you enjoy masterful music, and tasty slide playing, and/or any of these musicians, you'll enjoy this - for sure.",1357948800,3,1256,4.648648648648648
8035555,5,B00030606U,and that's a good thing.  Brozeman rocks.  Would you say 'no' to an opportunity to sit down with some of the best musicians in the business?,1327363200,3,140,4.346153846153846
