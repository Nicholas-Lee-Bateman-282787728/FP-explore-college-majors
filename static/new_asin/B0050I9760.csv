4514204,4,B0050I9760,"WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?  A good storyline perhaps?  Probably...sure this anime is lacking in a good story, but you cant find better graphichs on any anime.  This freaking artist needs to team up with narutos crew or something.  Not that naruto is lacking in the art department, but it would make narutos fight scenes way more intense!  This anime might just be a one time watcher, but I like it enough to continue owning it.  Try a few scenes online before you buy, you'll know what im talking about.",1317081600,,499,4.488888888888889
4514205,5,B0050I9760,"The other reviews are right on the money as far as the plot line goes. The plot line isn't very complex, but it does keep you entertained. Definitely not for the kids, though, since it has suggestive actions in addition to the nudity.  The disks I have were the blu-ray version, which appeared very crisp and clear.  The artwork needs a bit of description, though.  It appears to be a cross between Japanese woodcuts and Japanese Sum-e ink drawing. This means that there aren't any really saturated colors and the perspective is a little flattened. The use of ink-type illustration means that outlines tend to be inked in pretty heavily, lending to a little harshness. This gets more pronounced as you go through the show, to the point that some parts of the last episode look more like manga drawings. The ink motif is also use for transitions between scenes, where the ink appears as ink drops or brush strokes across the screen. This wasn't a problem for me, but might not appeal to some people.  The blu-ray version has the extras on the second disk, and appear to be a step above the extras with some titles. In particular, it includes very good drawings of the characters in different costumes, and what is essential an ova for each individual character.",1315612800,,1260,4.6877828054298645
4514206,5,B0050I9760,"There seems to be a dojo master called Muneakira who turns females in samurai masters with powerful elemental powers by kissing them. There is a lot of nudity with large breasts, but no observed sex acts. There are several females characters with their own unique personalities.",1315440000,27,278,5.065217391304348
4514207,4,B0050I9760,"I'll be honest, I didn't really read much about this show ahead-of-time. I read the general synopsis and went ahead and bought it because it sounded interesting. Most animes are suggestive and have sexy anime characters, but they're usually clothed. Lots of full-on nudity in this show, so don't buy this for kids.

The plot is pretty good, kind of predictable and silly, but I really enjoyed it. The drawing was decent although the blotching at the beginning was disconcerting, and the characters as a whole have enough personality to make the show enjoyable. The guy who does the voice for the main character is probably my least favorite because he comes off as entirely too dramatic, but the other characters' voices make up for it. If you like a light-hearted, fun anime where one wave of a sword blows people's clothes off this one is worth watching.",1314576000,45,856,4.783783783783784
4514208,4,B0050I9760,this show is interesting to say the least. Its an interesting take on history. I loved the art style the most and would love if more anime looked like this. This anime isn't for everyone. I enjoyed it and the Japanese voice acting was good (I don't know about English Dub) but I would have someone watch an episode first before buying the series. I would buy it but my taste in anime is a lot different then most of the people that I know (mostly they watch gundam or other more main stream animes).,1313539200,5,499,4.2631578947368425

It is nice to be able to kick back and watch Jubei as a sweet innocent girl, and then transform into the ultimate warrior. I was worried at the end, but if you get the Samurai Bride, you will breath a sigh of relief that she is back. To bad they always seem to screw up the male as a virginal wimp who when confronted with certain situations bleeds through the nose or grovels like a coward. For once they could make a hero that can step forward and control the situation, not run from it or be bullied by others. All in all this is truly an action filled shows that has some hilarious twist and turns. If you get it, enjoy.",1412035200,,778,4.158940397350993

4514234,5,B0050I9760,"First off, this is an uncensored anime with lots of naughty parts (especislly the extras), so it is definitely not recommended for people under 18.

Samurai Girls is beautifully animated. I recommend checking out the censored version on Prime video or YouTube sometime, because the ink drops are hilarious. The main style is watercolor mixed with modern anime. It's clean, although there are times where the stills look like they came out of a dating sim. Regardless, the action looks good and the gags are pretty funny.

Going into my deep story part... Think of it as Western religion threatening the Japanese way of life.... just with boobs and fighting in skimpy, exploding costumes to make it go down easier.

Enjoy it for what it is. It's a fun harem anime and it looks great.",1408060800,,782,4.777777777777778

4514242,4,B0050I9760,The ending left a lot to be enjoyed. Not to give away the whole plot but it was anticlimatical. It seemed the writer ran out of ideas and just stopped.

1. the animation is breathtaking
2. nothing wrong with naked women wielding swords
3. the dub isn't bad
4. good comedy
Here are my cons:
1. story line leaves much to be desired
2. not as much action as I would have liked..
3. not enough of Gisen!
This series is great if you are into tons of fanservice, comedy, and harem style. I will say the animation is absolutely beautiful!!",1390435200,,467,4.258426966292135

4514247,4,B0050I9760,"The series has a great idea, sure it follows a bit of a harem style, but then not really. This guy is not the typical clueless or undecisive type. The story arc is good and moves along steadily, but then the last 4 episodes suddenly seam to be rushing toward a closing end. The quick change of pace is disturbing and you feel as if some issues were left unresolved. I did feel that the ""boobies"" were over the top. It seemed every time the scene changed there was more and more fan service without the typical girls screaming and blushing. I also felt that some of the topics were borderline ""nasty"". These are not mere inuendos, but direct and clear verbal pornography. So be warned, because it caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind fan service, but that is about it for me so long as it is done with humor. Samurai girls is worth watching, good story line, great acting, wonderful follow through with the ending. I do have to give extra points for the theme of love. The idea portrayed in this series is that a general and a samurai will kiss and make a pact of trust and bond that will unlock her super samurai powers. The show really defines this as a pact that can not be made from lust or sexual desire. The pact must be made from love, trust, and respect for the bond to work. If a pact is attempted by kissing out of lust, the other pacts will break and the samurai girls will lose thier powers forever. That earned some merit with me.",1381104000,5,1459,4.270758122743683

I said naked boobs right?

Also, a season two IS online. It's called Samurai Bride. I'll be watching it soon. I actually finished season 1 last night.

The animation style is different than what I've ever seen. It's a little weird, and I'm sorry I don't know how to explain it.",1376524800,11,559,4.6938775510204085
4514250,4,B0050I9760,"Put simply,its a good addition to my collection. Was hoping for something a little bloodier. And it kinda rushes you through the story. But the pros out-weigh the cons. Interesting story filled with comedy,romance,and action. Its soundtrack is great. Similar to KARAS.Fighting like BLEACH but not much. Lots of topless nudity but brief. Aside from the boobs-great for all ages. I really enjoyed the characters. Theyre all unique and easy on the ears. I watched english dub. Subtitles off.

Parents be ware that these woman WILL be exposed above the waiste quite often, all while implying suggestive acts.  Other than those two things I didn't like much.  Story was not fully threshed out and rushed in the final couple episodes leaving a lot of unknowns.

If your a Samurai Anime fan you should pick this up it is fun and enjoyable to watch and it is one you can watch over and over again.

This is also not your typical Samurai anime I won't spoil anything but you will not be disapointed.

Due to  Violance, Blood, Cursing and ""Nudity"" this is not for children. This is what I thought of a almost tasteless anime but you gotta watch it for your self...",1322611200,,642,4.2727272727272725

4514277,4,B0050I9760,"I have read mixed reviews in other places on this series (while searching for information on a series 2) and am glad i didn't read before buying. There is a heram element to this anime which does to some extent constrain the scope of the characters though the main male character isn't as useless as they normally are and for a change isn't a creepy looser just a little clueless. This sort of fair will never win prizes for its writting but such is life what it does have is
Good
unique looking art (some have critisised the back grounds as simple but i like them they bring to mind sumi {though they aren't})
great character design
i thought the comody part was fairly good and the story concept was good though there were a couple of details which lacked consistency.

debateable
lots of light ecci fan service
harem fantasy not exceptionally heavy done but present which tends to shape the character development of the harem and often involves slightly stereotyped characters (though not as bad as some.
ink splot accents borders on being overdone but i accept it as being a stylistic choice (in censored version was apparently fairly intrusive but was ok in DVD)

bad
ending felt rushed It feels like it needed a bit more or another series (i liked it enough to hope for another series).

In all i thought it was pretty and stylistically interesting you cared whether people lived or died and it was good light hearted entrtainment despite its limitations.",1317513600,3,1461,4.6770428015564205
4514278,5,B0050I9760,"At first glance ""Samurai Girls"" looks like it's going to be a pretty bland ""eye-candy"" piece. However this show blew out my expectations pretty quickly. I'll keep the review spoiler-free but overall this is a series very much worth viewing. The characters develop with the plot into truly appealing characters with real heart and soul. The series ends very well, every plot line is neatly tied up and leaves it open for a second season but could be easily its own stand-alone piece. All in all it was a great experience and I am really interested to see if the series is continued and gets another season. Worth every penny. A fun and heart-warming series that really comes into its own with something for everyone.",1317427200,,715,4.728

8451230,4,B0050I9760,I had never heard of or seen this series before I stumbled across an artbook with the characters from this series. I love the unique art style and the sexy characters.
