Most don't even have an insert telling the information. Other than that, these are most enjoyable disks. The music is always good and the filming supurb. If you wish to travel from the comfort of your own living room, try one of these travel music videos.",1276905600,,431,4.333333333333333
7896699,3,6305838542,"This is a very nice, scenic and musical video with a major flaw.  This flaw is at the very beginning when they are showing what would have been a beautiful scene of the Don Quijote and Sancho Panza statutes at the Plaza de Espaa in Madrid.  The statutes are surrounded by scaffolds, as it seems that they were either cleaning them or doing some maintenance.  They should have waited a couple of weeks and film this later when the scaffolds were not there.  They stick out like a sore thumb!  Or they should have gone somewhere else to film.  If they wanted a statute of Don Quijote, there is a nice one in Ciudad Real (La Mancha).",1133654400,5,630,4.3418803418803416
7896700,4,6305838542,"This film are the one of a Naxos Musical Journey DVD series. The classic music are very easy listening, also beautiful. The image quality looks like shot by digital camera. mostly of image quality are good. some parts are  excellent. less 8 percent of image are little blur, or I should said too  softly? because the focusing not very sharp as others present.
However,  the scenic in this film are very beautiful and nice to watch it. I found  even you turn the subtitle on, no further text will show on screen. This  kind of films usually have description of the scenic and its story. I think  this feature can be enhanced in their furture release DVDs.
The picture  is beautifully rendered, with warm and fully saturated hues to make you  feel like you are really in there. Colors are rich and nicely balanced,  most of the image are sharp and finely detailed. However, some part appear  slightly soft.
The Dolby(r) Digital 5.1-channel soundtrack is an  impressive listening experience that surely present the effect for  symphony. The dts soundtrack provide you more rich sound and surround  effect than Dolby(r) Digital 5.1-channel soundtrack. I just can say, even  only listing the music also worth to buy this DVD title.
The superbly  recorded classic music has good spatial depth and penetrates the listening  space at times, substantially heightening the emotional intensity. I  suggestion the dts soundtrack will be the only choice for this DVD when you  listening.
By the way, I'll buy the other DVD titles of a Naxos Musical  Journey DVD, because I saw the other titles preview in this DVD. You will  like the music they choose, and you can treat the image like the gift in  these DVD titles. If there have more detailed descript of the scenic will  get the four and an half star from me.",961459200,22,1799,4.7540453074433655
