3048577,4,B0010DM3R4,"**** 2005. Written and directed by John Turturro. An original musical comedy with some great actors like Susan Sarandon, Christopher Walken and Kate Winslet. Too bad that the movie didn't find its public because the screenplay is smart, the music agreeable and some scenes really hilarious. Recommended because a film that is not seen is a dead movie.

The movie has a great cast and great acting, although the music was sometimes oft-putting.

3048602,5,B0010DM3R4,"Brace yourself! This hard R-rated romp from 2005 is almost impossible to categorize. Is it a comedy? Is it a romance? Is it a musical? Is it a farce? By the time you see Christopher Walken sing ""Delilah"" beneath the window of his lost love, it no longer matters. When the Coen brothers produce a quirky movie, you KNOW the soundtrack will be memorable.

Art house favorite John Turturro (""Fading Gigolo"") both wrote and directed this goofy little thing (IMDb calls it ""down-and-dirty"") and look who he enlisted to help:
  * James Gandolfini (""Enough Said"") is Nick, an unfaithful husband, sorta repentant, but still tempted. He's cheating on...
  * Susan Sarandon (""Tammy"") Yeah... Can you believe it? She is Kitty, his beleaguered wife, trying to understand him.
  * Kate Winslet (""Divergent"") Once you see TULA, you understand. You have NEVER seen Winslet so outrageously seductive and wild (or hear such a potty mouth!).
  * Elaine Stritch (""30 Rock"") is Nick's mother who...Oh you know Stritch. She's unique all over again.
  * Steve Buscemi (""Boardwalk Empire"") is one of Nick's co-workers. Their chats during their lunch breaks, perched on the structural steel of a new high rise, are unforgettable peeks into his x-rated brain.

Of course we have an assortment of daughters, their boyfriends and all the conflict THAT engenders, plus some fellows circling Kitty, hoping that she'll pull the plug on her marriage.

I wish I could remember who recommended this to me. I've checked with the usual suspects and they all claim they are innocent. I have this one in my personal collection, otherwise no one would believe me! I got mine from Amazon.",1408406400,4,1649,4.952727272727273

It's like a roller coaster ride for the senses. And now a real gem with Gandolfini 's performance. Then there's Kate Winslet who displays her movie star qualities en force.

3048612,5,B0010DM3R4,"If you are the kind of person who wishes trashmen would break out into song and dance or a church choir would launch into ""Piece of My Heart"", you will most likely love Romance and Cigarettes.

James Gandolfini is Nick Murder and he's in a troubled relationship (to put it mildly) with Kitty Kane (Susan Sarandon). He's fooling around on the side with Tula (played by an unbelievably foul-mouthed Kate Winslet) and must deal with his slightly crazed daughters Baby (Mandy Moore), Constance (Mary-Louise Parker) and Rosebud (Aida Turturro), who all side with Mom. Even the cosmos turns against him. The movie turns quite dark at times, but always the songs keep coming, bringing out emotions these folks can't or don't want to express in mere prose.

The cast list alone should make any movie fan want to see this. The above mentioned actors plus Steve Buscemi (in a great know-it-all work partner role), Elaine Stritch, Bobby Cannavale (as the neighborhood stud), Christopher Walken (hilarious - picture Walken singing the Tom Jones standard, ""Delilah""), Amy Sedaris and others. Directed and written by John Turturro.

What's not to like? Well, there's the issue of the songs. Not the choice of songs - they are all good - but most begin by being sung by the actor and then sort of fade into a commercial version of the song. It's kind of like karaoke, a little lip-syncing and a little singalong. Some don't like it. I have no problem with it. Of course there's the issue of that misguided segment of humanity which just doesn't like musicals. So sad... If you're in that group, skip this movie.

But if any of this piques your interest, give it a try.",1397088000,2,1653,4.7491289198606275

3048616,5,B0010DM3R4,"Gandolfini plays a chain smoking blue collar guy who finds himself in lust with a woman other than his wife. The wife he has spent his life with and he can't find the balls to tell her the truth... that he wants to leave. But she, no ones fool, figures it out and tells him she knows what's going on and that requires him to face the oldest question in romantic relationships... Am I in love or in lust, and what;s the difference? What he decides and how he proceeds is the stuff of the movie. But, discovering he has lung cancer and is likely to parish, well now, that is a complication that makes all the other silly passions of our life... almost moot. This film is oft referred to as a cult musical. I guess that makes me a cult follower. The music is just right for this film and there is a dance sequence at the beginning that I consider the best conceived dance choreography since Gene Kelly and Donald O'connor in ""Singing In the Rain"". It is not that the dance moves are incredibly skillfull and acrobatic; It is that they are brilliantly thought out. It is as though it was choreographed by a blue collar guy with movements blue collar guys would come up with if they were asked to dance. Yeah, you get it.  I'm in love with this movie.",1394841600,,1246,4.279661016949152

Gandolfini is terrific, Susan Sarandon gives a great performance, and the rest of the cast were at the highest level. the music creeps up on you at the beginning of the show, very nicely.  Dancing is outstanding and fits the story line beautifully.

I honestly did not make it all the way through the film.

3048624,5,B0010DM3R4,"Truly an original way of migrating classic rock songs that we all know that slowly immerse into the dialogue between the characters. So in this case it's not a bunch of actors trying to prove how well they can sing but how profoundly and ironic these familiar rock songs weave into every day situations. The actors don't take themselves overly seriously like most musicals lately. But of course James Gandolfini is a course in top form as he always was. God rest his soul. This is truly a very entertaining film in a very original approach to using music as a soundtrack for every persons every days life dramas. As with most of us when we hear a great song either driving in the car or listening in our headphones we all have a song that we feel so closely linked to And then find ourselves slowly starting to sing along and we all at one say to ourselves, ""This song is the soundtrack of my life"". And that's exactly what this movie does. Which I have never seen done this way before. Totally non-pretentious. Totally original. And totally great performances by the whole cast ensemble. Definitely worth the watch. Especially if like me you are not all that entertained by film musicals.",1390262400,,1189,4.586854460093897

3048646,1,B0010DM3R4,"Wow....this movie is bad. If there were no-name actors in this and it was being made by producers & directors & writers making their first movie you could understand some of the excess and horribleness you'll see, but when you consider that Academy Award winning actors & actresses & producers are involved in this you're simply in disbelief. It's a good thing James Gandolfini made this after he made The Sopranos, because I don't think he'd ever work again after folks saw this. I'm not quite sure where to start.....

You don't connect with any of the characters, who are really only caricatures. It was as if Turturro was working in every wacky character into this film in fear that he'd never get a chance to make another movie.
If Mary Louise Parker & Mandy Moore & Aida Turturro & Amy Sedaris were trying to top each other in awfulness, they all win. Except they'd be 2nd behind Bobby Carnavale.
I always thought that Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken are great in everything. Here I learn that they're only as good as their material, and this material stinks. John Turturro managed to make a movie with Steve Buscemi & Christopher Walken that is horrible. I think anybody else could have made something half decent with only one of them.
What Kate Winslet was doing with James Gandolfini, and why she was so over the top, escapes me.

This was such a train wreck I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Until I had to. At that point I just tried to click on the singing & dancing scenes. Because as bad as this movie is, I did enjoy some of the singing & dancing. Maybe if the movie ONLY had that it would have been OK. Susan Sarandon looked great. Like a real woman should look. It was fun seeing Kate Winslet in her Mae West persona, but she was just too way out.

I'm probably extra disappointed because there aren't many movies on Amazon Prime that have Academy Award winners in them. Heck, you can't even get Police Academy for free with Amazon Prime, forget about Academy Award winners. And what do we get? Romance and Cigarettes.

I fear people thinking "" Oh it is a musical- probably corny"", because this was not corny.

It was different and it was different for J.G. to star in it.

  But he and the all star cast pulled it off while telling a poignant, realistic story about life.

 It is a musical dramedy taking place in Brooklyn.

  Christopher Walken steals the show when it comes to the areas that need levity.

 Kate Winslet almost is not recognizeable between heavy accent and dress.

 Sarandon is very believable as the tired of life wife ,of J.G.

 Lots of other big name stars in here.

The plot may be simple- but the plot is also something real, something that happens in the lives of many people.

Even if musicals are not your bag or you don't get into the music, you will still appreciate the slice of living this movie presents.

We no longer have J.G. any more. I am sure fans frantically looked for any movies he made on AMAZON to rent or buy.

 I found this one while looking for a rental with J.G. in a movie where he actually has a leading role and have to say, while I had my doubts about a musical dramedy, J.G.'s comments about ROMANCE AND CIGARETTES and the way the movie ends, got me right in the heart.

Rated R.
Finally a romantic comedy musical for real He men! And it's about freaking time!
Offbeat and tweaked, and totally bent. Dripping with cigarette smoke, beer fumes and guy sweat.
And the lusty lure of women in red.
For manly men only. No girls allowed.
Prudes beware.
Plenty of classic songs punctuate the procedings throughout.
Buscemi is positively hilarious.
Somebody, anybody, please, oh please,  pinch me. And pinch me hard.
Bizarre choreography abounds, along with the twisted humor.
Very much a one of a kind Indie film. Oddball characters spring out of nowhere.
Kate Winslet is just as gloriously sexy as she could possibly be. I vote her the sexiest redhead alive. She is literally mouth watering in her bad girl role.
Through it all the movie does have its serious side, too, as a husband and his wife and their daughters all go through marital and family issues.

3048664,4,B0010DM3R4,"""Romance and Cigarettes"" feels like ""Pennies From Heaven"" imagined by the Coen Brothers.  It should come as no surprise that it was executive produced by the brothers.  It should also not be surprising that it was directed by John Turturro, a Coen vet.  Regardless, the film is a mixed bag.  It concerns a love triangle between Nick and Kitty Murder(James Gandolfini and Susan Sarandon) and Tula(Kate Winslet).  The film lapses into occasional musical vignettes where the actors lip synch AM pop ditties by the likes of Tom Jones and Englebert among others.  This could work but Turturro doesn't have complete faith in the conceit which drains these numbers of any irony they were supposed to have.  The film contains enough interesting moments that it should be checked out.  There are scene-stealing moments from Winslet, Steve Buscemi, Elaine Stritch, and Christopher Walken who does a mean ""Delilah"".  Ironically, Walken was featured in the 1981 film version of ""Pennies From Heaven"" starring Steve Martin.

The rage that transpires from his wife, is like a virus that catches on to all his daughters and even his own mother.

However, it is Kate Winslet who steals the show.  She is the seductress that prefers emotionally unavailble men and they turn her on for as long as they are not in love with her.  Once they do fall in love, the affair is over.  Winslet has so much fun in this movie that it is hillarious to listen to her speak with ehr British accent, make love (to Gandolfini's character) and get into a cat fight with no ther woman ut Susan Sarandon!

We found ourselves laughing so hard at times... not sure if at ourselves for having succumbed to feelings of guilt... if we bought the DVD we must watch it to the end kind of feelings...

James Gandolfini is his usual awesome self playing Nick Murder, husband to Kitty Murder, played by Susan Sarandon. He is having an affair with a red headed woman by the name of Tula, played by an unusual Kate Winslet, who always comes across as pure and highly educated, and yet in this film, she is simply... crude.

The movie opens by showing us the relationship between Mr. Murder and one of his daughters and soon we realized that all daughters hate him because he cheats on ""mom"" who is... that girl with the kind eyes!

Christopher Walken is superb as the friend that helps Kitty deal with the adultery of her husband and when he tells her his own troubled relationship with a woman through Tom Jones song Delilah... we simply could not resist but to rewind so we could see it again.

I ultimately have to say the same thing for what makes this movie great as I've said about too many movies and tv shows lately; it's more of a reaction to it's medium than it is to reality.

3048686,5,B0010DM3R4,"Musicals have become all the rage lately (I feel so weird saying `all the rage') and `Romance & Cigarettes' is yet another in the long line; but there is something different about this `musical', something that makes it stand apart as superior to the rest.  John Turturro's `Romance & Cigarettes' is one of the strangest musicals I've ever seen, one that is definitely not for every palate but one that is sure to find it's cult following and devoted fans.  It's abrasive, crude and ultimately unforgettable.  The tagline for this film's is `A Savage Musical' and while that may sum up the film in part there is really so much heart here that it seems unjust to classify it as `savage'.

`Romance & Cigarettes' follows blue collar worker Nick Murder as he juggles his relationships with the women in his life.  His marriage to Kitty is falling apart, mostly due to his relationship with vixen Tula.  His daughters Baby, Constance and Rosebud despise him for what he has done to their mother and his girlfriend Tula is challenging him in ways he didn't know he could be challenged.  And then there is his mother who will never forgive him for becoming his father.  While Nick is sorting out his life Kitty is trying to find herself.  She visits the church of which she's all but forsaken.  She contemplates handling Tula on her own, for good.  She battles her feelings about her husband as well as those about her dead ex-lover.

`Romance & Cigarettes' plays out like a musical meets a black romantic comedy meets a crime noir meets a family drama.  The `musical' elements are open song where characters either sing along or lip synch to pop ballads; where musical numbers are performed in the middle of the street complete with choreographed dancing.  The minute Gandolfini walks out the front door singing `A Man Without Love' you know you're in for a treat.  It's definitely `out there' but it all fits together in such an oddly fulfilling way that you can't help but embrace it.

The performances are stellar, truly stellar.  James Gandolfini almost reprises his role of Tony Soprano when you really think about it.  Sure, he's not a mobster but his family life (the cheating, the sick form of loyalty to his mate, the sympathetic failure) is pretty similar.  He nails it, but that's to be expected.  Susan Sarandon also nails her part as the eccentric down trodden mother.  Her performance is similar to her role in `Igby Goes Down' (another SOLID piece of work).  Mandy Moore, Mary-Louise Parker and Aida Turturro all deliver fine performances as the three daughters, Parker standing out due to her scene stealing antics.  Christopher Walken is hilarious as Cousin Bo and Elaine Stritch has a noteworthy cameo as Nick's mother.

Standout here though is none other than Kate Winslet.  Her performance as the dirty mouthed Tula is outstanding.  The things that come out of her mouth are so horrible yet she says them with such calm and ease you can't help but believe every word.  How she made it through her dialog without gagging on her own laughter is beyond me.  How she was passed over for an Oscar nomination is also beyond me.

`Romance & Cigarettes' is one of those films that stays with you whether you like it or not.  It's imaginative and original and completely ridiculous in a manor that makes you want to be a part of this crazy world somehow.  With stellar performances that elevate the screenplay and tender moments that add layers of emotional depth to the chaos on screen, `Romance & Cigarettes' is definitely worth the ride.",1204588800,46,3546,4.745098039215686

A witty, lively and plain ol' fun production -- every frame bursting with a creative and cinephile-loving joie de vivre all too rarely seen in film these days.  Just give yourself 10 minutes and I dare you not to be swept up in this happy fest of our horrible, wonderful humaness.",1204243200,6,596,5.1875
3048688,4,B0010DM3R4,"It's hard to describe `Romance and Cigarettes' without sounding weird or schmaltzy, but it's a rock solid romantic comedy that's driven by its offbeat dialogue and characters.  Produced by the Coen Brothers, but directed and written by veteran actor John Turturro, the film still feels like a Coen Brothers' venture if they made musical comedies, which, partly, they do.

To give you a flavor of the movie, it starts off with Constance Murder (Mary-Louise Parker) walking up to her unfaithful father, Nick (James Gandolfini, 'The Sopranos') who's asleep on the couch in their modest NY suburban home, snoring away like a slow moving saw.  Her arms are akimbo and her face sports disapproval, yet she seems to show compassion as the mounting evidence comes in for yet another mistress and another affair, which is written all over her face.  She walks up to him and puts her lit cigarette between his toes.  She walks out of the room, and after a pregnant pause, we hear him yell out in pain.

His daughters are on mom, (Susan Sarandon) Katie Murder's side, so she's really wronged in a one-sided way.  She wears her anguish on her sleeve and in song (as she reconnects with her local Catholic church choir.)  One of the best scenes is when they wiggle and grind through a steamy rendition of ""Take Another Piece of My Heart"".  (You know, the one Janis Joplin made so famous).  One of her daughters has all the looks she may have lost, is in a rock band, and is steady with her dancer boyfriend (Duck-tail flamboyant Bobby Cannavale) who also co-fronts the band.

On his way to work, Nick sings along with the soundtrack, so his voice absurdly blends in Karaoke style with Engelbert Humperdinck's ""A Man Without Love"" in a lavishly choreographed neighborhood scene.  The juxtaposition of fantasy with mundane reality must be a Hollywood trend, for I kept thinking of `Across the Universe' here or `Enchanted' and `Hairspray'.  Yet, it would be unfair for me to keep those connections too strong here, for I felt like I was watching something uniquely sublime and daffy.

There isn't really much of plot, per se, except for the ramifications of his British adulterous interest (Kate Winslet), but the character study is enough to keep the pages turning.  Nick is able to confide with fellow hardhat Angelo (Steve Buscemi) whose lecherous confessions on the job are both grim and practical, and Katie relies on her quirky cousin (Christopher Walken) to boost her spirits and keep her sense of purpose in life.

Much like the aforementioned films, `Romance and Cigarettes' uses musical comedy to rise about the dingy skylines and heart rending realities with some fun fantasies that both escape one's lot in life and process the wounds.  I'd say after all is said and done, this is a fun and colorful film that is a real pleasure to watch.

3283099,5,B0010DM3R4,"Brace yourself! This hard R-rated romp from 2005 is almost impossible to categorize. Is it a comedy? Is it a romance? Is it a musical? Is it a farce? By the time you see Christopher Walken sing ""Delilah"" beneath the window of his lost love, it no longer matters. When the Coen brothers produce a quirky movie, you KNOW the soundtrack will be memorable.

Art house favorite John Turturro (""Fading Gigolo"") both wrote and directed this goofy little thing (IMDb calls it ""down-and-dirty"") and look who he enlisted to help:
  * James Gandolfini (""Enough Said"") is Nick, an unfaithful husband, sorta repentant, but still tempted. He's cheating on...
  * Susan Sarandon (""Tammy"") Yeah... Can you believe it? She is Kitty, his beleaguered wife, trying to understand him.
  * Kate Winslet (""Divergent"") Once you see TULA, you understand. You have NEVER seen Winslet so outrageously seductive and wild (or hear such a potty mouth!).
  * Elaine Stritch (""30 Rock"") is Nick's mother who...Oh you know Stritch. She's unique all over again.
  * Steve Buscemi (""Boardwalk Empire"") is one of Nick's co-workers. Their chats during their lunch breaks, perched on the structural steel of a new high rise, are unforgettable peeks into his x-rated brain.

Of course we have an assortment of daughters, their boyfriends and all the conflict THAT engenders, plus some fellows circling Kitty, hoping that she'll pull the plug on her marriage.

I wish I could remember who recommended this to me. I've checked with the usual suspects and they all claim they are innocent. I have this one in my personal collection, otherwise no one would believe me! I got mine from Amazon.",1408406400,4,1649,4.952727272727273

3283109,5,B0010DM3R4,"If you are the kind of person who wishes trashmen would break out into song and dance or a church choir would launch into ""Piece of My Heart"", you will most likely love Romance and Cigarettes.

James Gandolfini is Nick Murder and he's in a troubled relationship (to put it mildly) with Kitty Kane (Susan Sarandon). He's fooling around on the side with Tula (played by an unbelievably foul-mouthed Kate Winslet) and must deal with his slightly crazed daughters Baby (Mandy Moore), Constance (Mary-Louise Parker) and Rosebud (Aida Turturro), who all side with Mom. Even the cosmos turns against him. The movie turns quite dark at times, but always the songs keep coming, bringing out emotions these folks can't or don't want to express in mere prose.

The cast list alone should make any movie fan want to see this. The above mentioned actors plus Steve Buscemi (in a great know-it-all work partner role), Elaine Stritch, Bobby Cannavale (as the neighborhood stud), Christopher Walken (hilarious - picture Walken singing the Tom Jones standard, ""Delilah""), Amy Sedaris and others. Directed and written by John Turturro.

What's not to like? Well, there's the issue of the songs. Not the choice of songs - they are all good - but most begin by being sung by the actor and then sort of fade into a commercial version of the song. It's kind of like karaoke, a little lip-syncing and a little singalong. Some don't like it. I have no problem with it. Of course there's the issue of that misguided segment of humanity which just doesn't like musicals. So sad... If you're in that group, skip this movie.

Am I in love or in lust, and what;s the difference? What he decides and how he proceeds is the stuff of the movie. But, discovering he has lung cancer and is likely to parish, well now, that is a complication that makes all the other silly passions of our life... almost moot. This film is oft referred to as a cult musical. I guess that makes me a cult follower. The music is just right for this film and there is a dance sequence at the beginning that I consider the best conceived dance choreography since Gene Kelly and Donald O'connor in ""Singing In the Rain"". It is not that the dance moves are incredibly skillfull and acrobatic; It is that they are brilliantly thought out.

This is truly a very entertaining film in a very original approach to using music as a soundtrack for every persons every days life dramas. As with most of us when we hear a great song either driving in the car or listening in our headphones we all have a song that we feel so closely linked to And then find ourselves slowly starting to sing along and we all at one say to ourselves, ""This song is the soundtrack of my life"".

3283143,1,B0010DM3R4,"Wow....this movie is bad. If there were no-name actors in this and it was being made by producers & directors & writers making their first movie you could understand some of the excess and horribleness you'll see, but when you consider that Academy Award winning actors & actresses & producers are involved in this you're simply in disbelief. It's a good thing James Gandolfini made this after he made The Sopranos, because I don't think he'd ever work again after folks saw this. I'm not quite sure where to start.....

You don't connect with any of the characters, who are really only caricatures. It was as if Turturro was working in every wacky character into this film in fear that he'd never get a chance to make another movie.
If Mary Louise Parker & Mandy Moore & Aida Turturro & Amy Sedaris were trying to top each other in awfulness, they all win. Except they'd be 2nd behind Bobby Carnavale.
I always thought that Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken are great in everything. Here I learn that they're only as good as their material, and this material stinks. John Turturro managed to make a movie with Steve Buscemi & Christopher Walken that is horrible. I think anybody else could have made something half decent with only one of them.
What Kate Winslet was doing with James Gandolfini, and why she was so over the top, escapes me.

This was such a train wreck I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Until I had to. At that point I just tried to click on the singing & dancing scenes. Because as bad as this movie is, I did enjoy some of the singing & dancing. Maybe if the movie ONLY had that it would have been OK. Susan Sarandon looked great. Like a real woman should look. It was fun seeing Kate Winslet in her Mae West persona, but she was just too way out.

I'm probably extra disappointed because there aren't many movies on Amazon Prime that have Academy Award winners in them. Heck, you can't even get Police Academy for free with Amazon Prime, forget about Academy Award winners. And what do we get? Romance and Cigarettes. The movie that is now on the top of my worst ever list.",1383609600,,2098,4.486910994764398

3283152,4,B0010DM3R4,"Okay before you think this is going to be like a Rodgers and Hammerstein type musical made in today's era, let me assure you it is not.
I fear people thinking "" Oh it is a musical- probably corny"", because this was not corny.

It was different and it was different for J.G. to star in it.

  But he and the all star cast pulled it off while telling a poignant, realistic story about life.

 It is a musical dramedy taking place in Brooklyn.

  Christopher Walken steals the show when it comes to the areas that need levity.

 Kate Winslet almost is not recognizeable between heavy accent and dress.

 Sarandon is very believable as the tired of life wife ,of J.G.

 Lots of other big name stars in here.

The plot may be simple- but the plot is also something real, something that happens in the lives of many people.

Even if musicals are not your bag or you don't get into the music, you will still appreciate the slice of living this movie presents.

We no longer have J.G. any more. I am sure fans frantically looked for any movies he made on AMAZON to rent or buy.

 I found this one while looking for a rental with J.G. in a movie where he actually has a leading role and have to say, while I had my doubts about a musical dramedy, J.G.'s comments about ROMANCE AND CIGARETTES and the way the movie ends, got me right in the heart.

Rated R.
Finally a romantic comedy musical for real He men! And it's about freaking time!
Offbeat and tweaked, and totally bent. Dripping with cigarette smoke, beer fumes and guy sweat.
And the lusty lure of women in red.
For manly men only. No girls allowed.
Prudes beware.
Plenty of classic songs punctuate the procedings throughout.
Buscemi is positively hilarious.
Somebody, anybody, please, oh please,  pinch me. And pinch me hard.
Bizarre choreography abounds, along with the twisted humor.
Very much a one of a kind Indie film. Oddball characters spring out of nowhere.
Kate Winslet is just as gloriously sexy as she could possibly be. I vote her the sexiest redhead alive. She is literally mouth watering in her bad girl role.
Through it all the movie does have its serious side, too, as a husband and his wife and their daughters all go through marital and family issues.

3283161,4,B0010DM3R4,"""Romance and Cigarettes"" feels like ""Pennies From Heaven"" imagined by the Coen Brothers.  It should come as no surprise that it was executive produced by the brothers.  It should also not be surprising that it was directed by John Turturro, a Coen vet.  Regardless, the film is a mixed bag.  It concerns a love triangle between Nick and Kitty Murder(James Gandolfini and Susan Sarandon) and Tula(Kate Winslet).  The film lapses into occasional musical vignettes where the actors lip synch AM pop ditties by the likes of Tom Jones and Englebert among others.  This could work but Turturro doesn't have complete faith in the conceit which drains these numbers of any irony they were supposed to have.  The film contains enough interesting moments that it should be checked out.  There are scene-stealing moments from Winslet, Steve Buscemi, Elaine Stritch, and Christopher Walken who does a mean ""Delilah"".  Ironically, Walken was featured in the 1981 film version of ""Pennies From Heaven"" starring Steve Martin.

The rage that transpires from his wife, is like a virus that catches on to all his daughters and even his own mother.

We found ourselves laughing so hard at times... not sure if at ourselves for having succumbed to feelings of guilt... if we bought the DVD we must watch it to the end kind of feelings...

James Gandolfini is his usual awesome self playing Nick Murder, husband to Kitty Murder, played by Susan Sarandon. He is having an affair with a red headed woman by the name of Tula, played by an unusual Kate Winslet, who always comes across as pure and highly educated, and yet in this film, she is simply... crude.

Christopher Walken is superb as the friend that helps Kitty deal with the adultery of her husband and when he tells her his own troubled relationship with a woman through Tom Jones song Delilah... we simply could not resist but to rewind so we could see it again.

I ultimately have to say the same thing for what makes this movie great as I've said about too many movies and tv shows lately; it's more of a reaction to it's medium than it is to reality.

3283183,5,B0010DM3R4,"Musicals have become all the rage lately (I feel so weird saying `all the rage') and `Romance & Cigarettes' is yet another in the long line; but there is something different about this `musical', something that makes it stand apart as superior to the rest.  John Turturro's `Romance & Cigarettes' is one of the strangest musicals I've ever seen, one that is definitely not for every palate but one that is sure to find it's cult following and devoted fans.  It's abrasive, crude and ultimately unforgettable.  The tagline for this film's is `A Savage Musical' and while that may sum up the film in part there is really so much heart here that it seems unjust to classify it as `savage'.

`Romance & Cigarettes' follows blue collar worker Nick Murder as he juggles his relationships with the women in his life.  His marriage to Kitty is falling apart, mostly due to his relationship with vixen Tula.  His daughters Baby, Constance and Rosebud despise him for what he has done to their mother and his girlfriend Tula is challenging him in ways he didn't know he could be challenged.  And then there is his mother who will never forgive him for becoming his father.  While Nick is sorting out his life Kitty is trying to find herself.  She visits the church of which she's all but forsaken.  She contemplates handling Tula on her own, for good.  She battles her feelings about her husband as well as those about her dead ex-lover.

`Romance & Cigarettes' plays out like a musical meets a black romantic comedy meets a crime noir meets a family drama.  The `musical' elements are open song where characters either sing along or lip synch to pop ballads; where musical numbers are performed in the middle of the street complete with choreographed dancing.  The minute Gandolfini walks out the front door singing `A Man Without Love' you know you're in for a treat.  It's definitely `out there' but it all fits together in such an oddly fulfilling way that you can't help but embrace it.

The performances are stellar, truly stellar.  James Gandolfini almost reprises his role of Tony Soprano when you really think about it.  Sure, he's not a mobster but his family life (the cheating, the sick form of loyalty to his mate, the sympathetic failure) is pretty similar.  He nails it, but that's to be expected.  Susan Sarandon also nails her part as the eccentric down trodden mother.  Her performance is similar to her role in `Igby Goes Down' (another SOLID piece of work).  Mandy Moore, Mary-Louise Parker and Aida Turturro all deliver fine performances as the three daughters, Parker standing out due to her scene stealing antics.  Christopher Walken is hilarious as Cousin Bo and Elaine Stritch has a noteworthy cameo as Nick's mother.

Standout here though is none other than Kate Winslet.  Her performance as the dirty mouthed Tula is outstanding.  The things that come out of her mouth are so horrible yet she says them with such calm and ease you can't help but believe every word.  How she made it through her dialog without gagging on her own laughter is beyond me.  How she was passed over for an Oscar nomination is also beyond me.

`Romance & Cigarettes' is one of those films that stays with you whether you like it or not.  It's imaginative and original and completely ridiculous in a manor that makes you want to be a part of this crazy world somehow.  With stellar performances that elevate the screenplay and tender moments that add layers of emotional depth to the chaos on screen, `Romance & Cigarettes' is definitely worth the ride.",1204588800,46,3546,4.745098039215686
3283184,5,B0010DM3R4,"John Turturro has conceived a brilliantly poetic remythologizing of working class romance as foul-mouthed, libido-driven musical-comedy.

A witty, lively and plain ol' fun production -- every frame bursting with a creative and cinephile-loving joie de vivre all too rarely seen in film these days.  Just give yourself 10 minutes and I dare you not to be swept up in this happy fest of our horrible, wonderful humaness.",1204243200,6,596,5.1875
3283185,4,B0010DM3R4,"It's hard to describe `Romance and Cigarettes' without sounding weird or schmaltzy, but it's a rock solid romantic comedy that's driven by its offbeat dialogue and characters.  Produced by the Coen Brothers, but directed and written by veteran actor John Turturro, the film still feels like a Coen Brothers' venture if they made musical comedies, which, partly, they do.

To give you a flavor of the movie, it starts off with Constance Murder (Mary-Louise Parker) walking up to her unfaithful father, Nick (James Gandolfini, 'The Sopranos') who's asleep on the couch in their modest NY suburban home, snoring away like a slow moving saw.  Her arms are akimbo and her face sports disapproval, yet she seems to show compassion as the mounting evidence comes in for yet another mistress and another affair, which is written all over her face.  She walks up to him and puts her lit cigarette between his toes.  She walks out of the room, and after a pregnant pause, we hear him yell out in pain.

His daughters are on mom, (Susan Sarandon) Katie Murder's side, so she's really wronged in a one-sided way.  She wears her anguish on her sleeve and in song (as she reconnects with her local Catholic church choir.)  One of the best scenes is when they wiggle and grind through a steamy rendition of ""Take Another Piece of My Heart"".  (You know, the one Janis Joplin made so famous).  One of her daughters has all the looks she may have lost, is in a rock band, and is steady with her dancer boyfriend (Duck-tail flamboyant Bobby Cannavale) who also co-fronts the band.

On his way to work, Nick sings along with the soundtrack, so his voice absurdly blends in Karaoke style with Engelbert Humperdinck's ""A Man Without Love"" in a lavishly choreographed neighborhood scene.  The juxtaposition of fantasy with mundane reality must be a Hollywood trend, for I kept thinking of `Across the Universe' here or `Enchanted' and `Hairspray'.  Yet, it would be unfair for me to keep those connections too strong here, for I felt like I was watching something uniquely sublime and daffy.

There isn't really much of plot, per se, except for the ramifications of his British adulterous interest (Kate Winslet), but the character study is enough to keep the pages turning.  Nick is able to confide with fellow hardhat Angelo (Steve Buscemi) whose lecherous confessions on the job are both grim and practical, and Katie relies on her quirky cousin (Christopher Walken) to boost her spirits and keep her sense of purpose in life.

Much like the aforementioned films, `Romance and Cigarettes' uses musical comedy to rise about the dingy skylines and heart rending realities with some fun fantasies that both escape one's lot in life and process the wounds.  I'd say after all is said and done, this is a fun and colorful film that is a real pleasure to watch.
