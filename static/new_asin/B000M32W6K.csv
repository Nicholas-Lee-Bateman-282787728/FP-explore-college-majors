8166170,5,B000M32W6K,"I always wanted to learn a northern Shaolin straight sword form; however, the school I was going to closed before I was ever taught. So I bought this video. Like all martial arts you need a good foundation before staring to learn a weapon. If you already have that foundation this video will build on that. This video walks you through step by step on this straight sword form. It was a-lot fun and easy to pick up if you have some martial arts experience.",1320537600,,456,4.376470588235295
