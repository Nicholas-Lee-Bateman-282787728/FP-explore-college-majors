8336671,3,B001QW3SSC,"I've watched this movie before and loved it; however, I watched it online only and wanted my own copy. I ordered it from this company, but, unfortunately, I wasn't happy after watching thier dvd. They cut out some parts and was missing some subtitles. There was a part in the movie where people were talking in their native language and there was no subtitle. Also, they cut out the ending which, to me, actually connects the whole story together. Spoiler alert: They deleted the part where the movie showed that it was him who the nurse was working on when she got killed and that's why he avenged her death.",1369008000,,609,4.545454545454546
8336672,4,B001QW3SSC,"If you're looking for a movie that is Academy Award quality, you're in the wrong place. But if you're in the mood for a cheesy but kick-ass action flick, Legendary Assassin absolutely delivers.

I love deep movies that make you think. But like any red-blooded man, sometimes I just need an adrenaline-pumping action movie. This film offers great fight sequences, sprinkles of intentionally corny humor, and bone-crunching action. The fight scenes were choreographed by Nicky Li, an official member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team for over 15 years. If you've seen Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, or any other Jackie Chan flick, you've witnessed Li's fight choreography.

The film was shot surprisingly well, and has a terrific music score. I was impressed with the fact that this was the directorial debut of Wu Jing AKA Jacky Wu, who also plays the lead character Bo, a soft-spoken stranger who carries a mysterious bag everywhere. Legendary Assassin also marks the acting debut of the amazingly beautiful Hong King singer Celina Jade, starring as small-town police officer.

If there's any drawback to the movie, it's that there is virtually no character development or backstories. While most of the film's characters are memorable, and have their own unique vibe, you really don't get to learn anything about them. There's not much to the plot itself, and even Bo's motive for being an assassin isn't revealed until the film's conclusion. But despite that minor frustration, there's also a small twist revealed in the final scene that I was totally surprised to have not picked up on earlier in the film.

The film was shot in Hong Kong, and the dialogue is Cantonese with English subtitles. The DVD extra features include two short featurettes: The Making of Legendary Assassin, and The Characters of Legendary Assassin. The ""making of"" feature offers great insight as to why the lead character wears a wolf fang around his neck, and also provides details on the actors and production.

Overall, I thought this was a great action flick. It was intentionally shot to be kind of corny like an 80's martial arts movie, but the fight scenes definitely deliver. If you're a fan of Jackie Chan flicks, you should absolutely check out Legendary Assassin.",1345334400,,2250,4.989333333333334
8336673,5,B001QW3SSC,"This movie is filled with great martial art action. Again Wu Jing shows his dynamic skills as a martial artist and shows good acting skills, with a well supporting cast. It's a plus to see that he co directed the movie. Keep up the good work. I recommend this film.",1251676800,,265,4.32
8336674,3,B001QW3SSC,"Ever since the iconic martial arts alleyway fight sequence in ""SHAH PO LANG"" (aka. Killzone, U.S. title), Wu Jing has been the Hong Kong martial arts star expected to rise in the ranks of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Luck hasn't been really kind to this young martial artist, having a few mediocre films such as ""Invisible Target"" and ""Fatal Move"", Wu Jing's rise to action superstardom seems to have been delayed. However, the promising and charismatic Wu Shu Champion seems poised to steer his career in the right direction as he co-directs with Li-Chung Chi and stars in his latest attempt at solo action stardom; ""Legendary Assassin"" (2008).

Bo (Wu Jing) is a young man who uses his exceptional martial arts skills to execute criminals. He is quiet, stealthy and efficient. One evening, after killing Chairman Ma (Kou Zhan-Wen), the head of a syndicate, Bo is stuck in the same island when a typhoon halts all ferry trips. He wanders and meets a beautiful female cop named Hiu Wor (Celina Jade). After helping her apprehend a trio of suspects, Bo is invited to the station to make a statement. Bo realizes that Hiu had began to develop feelings for him and he seems ready to return the favor. However, Ma's wife, Boss Miho Sasaki, a much meaner crimelord is bent on revenge and she is rapidly closing in on him. Can Bo escape his sins all the while avoiding arrest by the police?

An assassin with a heart of gold--this formula has been overused but there have been impressive attempts to build an effective screenplay around this premise such as the awesome ""Azumi"", ""Fulltime Killer"", ""Crying Freeman"" and the original ""Bangkok Dangerous"". The plot in ""Legendary Assassin"" is pretty routine and the screenplay is definitely unimaginative. There are some nice touches as Bo wonders--""would God forgive our past?"" and I was rather very pleased that Donnie Yen didn't play this lead character. Yen may have a little bit of a ""cooler"" presence but he is too showy and overacting--with Wu Jing, at least, we get a quiet, humble presence that is likable and believable as a reluctant assassin. Wu is also a great martial artist so expect the moves to be performed with cool accuracy and the action would turn out convincing.

The proceedings of the film are also very simple, it lacks intricacy and individuality. The script is pretty much ""cardboard"" and never attempts to give an impression that this is more than your bland action film. The usual formulaic approaches are present; slapstick humor, obligatory characters, a budding romance between one on the side of the law and a man who is a renegade. It also tries to emote some sentimentality but it felt too mechanical. The trick with the flashbacks and the expositions doesn't carry much weight since it feels a little too repetitive; it feels more a visual filler rather than an inherent part of the film. There are also a hefty dose of plot holes so don't expect this film to win any awards.

Now as for the action, well, it is very entertaining to watch. The martial arts fights are very cool to see even though there is nothing quite fresh about them. Wu definitely knows how to perform the usual wire-fu as highlights include a first major fight with Ken Lo and two henchmen that includes a huge Chinese goon who looks like ""Jaws"" from Roger Moore's ""James Bond"" films. There is also a very cool set up when Bo walks in a heavy downpour with about a hundred opponents lined up to try and beat him to a pulp in the final fight. Most of the time, the results would be predictable, but they nonetheless fun to witness and very cool to watch. The fights are hard-hitting and brutal enough to excite the male testosterone with a mild showing of blood.

Aside from the film's fight sequences, the film does have its high points. The cops here at least may act inept at times but they do know how to fight. Sure, they're not in the same class as Bo, but at least Sammy Leung and Alex Fong get to mix it up with some action scenes. Tin Kai-man (Kung Fu Hustle) stars as the henchman named ""Jellyfish"" and he knows eagle claw kung fu. Lam Suet also makes an appearance but he had limited screen time. Japanese actress Aoyama Noriko is totally alluring as the mysterious Madame Miho Sasaki, I was left enthralled by her presence. Celina Jade's acting may be a little wooden but she does have that significant likable charm.

Yes, ""Legendary Assassin"" is your routine brainless action film, but it is real fun to watch. Certain plot elements are too perfunctory and it is definitely very predictable but if you manage to look beyond those weaknesses, Wu Jing's charisma and martial arts prowess may be enough to carry the film. The very cool climactic fight and the satisfying climax may be a little melodramatic but it is a satisfying resolution to an otherwise less than stellar movie. Solo Kung Fu superstardom is still within Wu's reach, but this film will not be that ONE film that will make him but at least it won't break him either. I am still keeping my fingers crossed that a project will come along to take him to new heights and fulfill his promise as the next Jet Li.

Recommended! [3  - Stars]",1233619200,,5155,4.644736842105263
