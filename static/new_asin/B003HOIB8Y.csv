And it came in good time.",1501027200,,47,3.8

8397165,4,B003HOIB8Y,"A very good video, with some outstanding stars speaking words about the future we might all pay attention to.

If viewing it in a group, as I did, I suggest watching only half, then pausing to discuss, before continuing.  Two sessions might be best.  The program covers so much that it's hard to take in and digest all at once.",1414972800,,327,4.416666666666667
8397166,5,B003HOIB8Y,"Barbara Marx Hubbard brings together a diverse assortment of scientists, philosophers, theologians and spiritual teachers to expand her vision of Humanity Ascending.  The varied perspectives on our unfolding evolutionary process are clear and exciting.  Visuals are love, and very helpful.",1384387200,,289,6.2
8397167,5,B003HOIB8Y,"This is a very positive, hopeful view of the next stage of humanity. I strongly suggest viewing it if anyone is saddened about the shape of our present world culture.

I got this video just after it was originally released back in 2012, and I have just watched it again. It is hard to believe that so much has changed in just a little over two years. In 2010, this video was groundbreaking. Yes, Barbara Marx Hubbard and others had been talking and writing and speaking about these ideas for many years, but their work was just reaching the tipping point of being in the common knowledge of society. So at the time, pulling together all these areas into one coherent story was on the cutting edge.

Now in early 2013, this - for me anyway - is common knowledge but still needs introduction into more of society.

I love the way this video was put together. It presents complex material without being too watered down, and without the viewer feeling like he or she is being talked down to. The layout or format and division of information is excellent. This video is a great introduction for anyone new to these ideas or concepts or wanted a better understanding or humanity's role in the coming years.

So basically, this video goes along with other material in the field of conscious evolution/human evolution, the unified field theory, and the move away from the industrial revolution and into the co-creative/compassion revolution.

Just excellent!
The author and other speakers on the video do not say that everything we have done in the past is bad, like some believe. They just say that what we have learned and done in the past has served its purpose and it is now time to move on to other or better things. Just like a butterfly moves on from the caterpillar stage, we must move on and get our of our cocoon and live in the next wonderful stage of humanity.",1357344000,3,1865,4.57185628742515
8397168,5,B003HOIB8Y,"The information provided from many different subjects, does not deny the problems. The ideas presented are simply a new approach of how we can create solutions.",1355788800,,160,5.1923076923076925
8397169,5,B003HOIB8Y,"Barbara Hubbard is a visionary. She sees the world as it is and understands the changes
that need to be made in order for us to survive. I just listened to an in depth interview
with Barbara on [...] that has helped me to understand I'm not the
only one out there who feels this shift in consciousness. World Wide Tipping Point is where
people are going to meet like minds. Organization is the beginning of realization.",1320710400,5,419,4.454545454545454
8397170,5,B003HOIB8Y,"In this DVD, Barbara Marx Hubbard, a futurist and visionary of our time, spreads her message that, ""Our crisis is our birth."" She brings together theologians, philosophers, physicists and visionaries to discuss the evolution of humanity. This film gives hope to humanity for a positive future and offers many illuminating ideas and concepts from well known personalities, including Jean Houston, Bruce Lipton and Rev. Michael Dowd. Widely known as Buckminster Fuller's philosophical heir, Hubbard is a social innovator, author and leader in the new worldview of conscious evolution. This movie is a true testimonial to all that Hubbard believes is possible for humanity.

8397171,5,B003HOIB8Y,The only way to overcome the problems we face is by ascending to a higher vibration in consciousness.  This DVD is full of many new and interesting perspectives in which we can all open our minds to without too much trouble.  I highly recommend it for those who are interested in a grander view of humanity's reason for being.,1276387200,20,326,4.508474576271187
