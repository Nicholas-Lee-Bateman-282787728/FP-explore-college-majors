3544338,5,B001DZOBZG,"Although 3hrs long, this is edge-of-your-seat entertainment that's intelligent, witty and enthralling. Its got Paul Gross so how could they go wrong? The dialogue is sooooo good. Just great. [Btw, sequel to H20]",1241827200,7,211,5.424242424242424
3544339,5,B001DZOBZG,"Short and sweet this movie was worth watching.  Yes some of it was far fetched but then again, who knows how much of it could actually be reality today. I had to give it five stars.",1239667200,3,181,4.027777777777778
3544340,5,B001DZOBZG,"Wow! Talk about gripping and intellectually surprising! This film is superb!  I had previously been unable to find a copy of the miniseries that preceded it (H20), but I went on another quest after watching only part of Trojan Horse. I will now have the complete set to relish.  What a treat this is! I'm not all that fond of action / political thrillers, but I think this one will (or should) become a classic.  I am constantly drawn further in and can never see what comes up next. Very well written, directed, acted.  Do not miss this film - you won't regret the 3 hours one little bit. You will want more!

Aside: Where can we find out about more good Canadian TV and film offerings while they are newly released? I've also bought _Slings and Arrows_, a completely different genre of film  but equally witty, engaging, and top drawer storytelling from Canada with thought-provoking forays into exploration the human heart and psyche.  Cheer up, Hamlet, indeed!",1235779200,24,964,4.7023809523809526
3544341,3,B001DZOBZG,"The Trojan Horse is perhaps a bit longer than many audiences would prefer and has a style of cinematography that is distinctly Canadian. For me - surrounded in Blockbuster by Hollywood films with different names but the same recipe - this story was refreshingly different.

The story centers around the absorption of the Canadian provinces into the U.S. and the resulting political intrigue surrounding one Canadian man's bid to insert himself as the next U.S. president.

While fictitious (and at times perhaps even ridiculous), the story contains certain elements of truth about U.S. politics, the rigors of the presidency, our current U.S. foreign affairs, and the strangely ambivalent relationship between the U.S. and Canada.

Good cast. Good intrigue. Worth watching.",1235606400,13,773,5.425

8295674,3,B001DZOBZG,It is ok story although the anti American slant is very unfair.  I think the US is a much better friend to Canada than the film allows.  I do not think that Canadian film writers have to denigrate a good relationship to be nationalistic.,1435708800,,237,4.363636363636363

8295676,5,B001DZOBZG,"I viewed the first half of The Trojan Horse on-line, but could never access the second half.  I was left hanging in the midst of international conspiracy, espionage, mystery, subterfuge and murder in an assortment of intricate sub-plots interwoven to make a riveting story.

Eventually I found the DVD at Amazon.com, and I loved the entire production.  However, I felt something was missing, and it turned out that Trojan Horse"" was a sequel, and I needed to watch H2O to pick up the back-story.

All of the complex characters are skillfully portrayed by a team of highly acclaimed actors.  Paul Gross is nothing short of brilliant as Tom McLaughlin; so is Martha Burns as down-to-earth Texas Senator Mary Miller.

Like H2O, The Trojan Horse is not easy recreational viewing; rather, it is very complex, and you need to pay close attention.  Put the kids to bed, and pop the popcorn before cranking up the DVD player  any distractions will make you want to go back to see what you missed.  Every event is predicated on deliciously perverse details you might have missed if you blinked.

With boundless political ambition at its very best, the playground moves from Canadian government to American politics.  If you like thrills and spills in your viewing entertainment, youll love this film.  The story wraps up with a MOST satisfying ending -- Karma, you know.",1418428800,,1361,4.895196506550218
8295677,5,B001DZOBZG,"Thoroughly engrossing [Oops! Sorry.] thoughtful political film [the sequel to H2O] that spotlights the Canadian view of things I'd never thought about -- being south of the border [well, Oregon]. I love getting other folks' perspective on political megalomaniacs and chicanery and this one so delivers. The cast is amazing, the writing by Paul Gross and John Krizanc is brilliant, and the suspenseful script pace never drags. The ending plays horrific, but thoroughly believable. [You'll never get me on this form of transit again! Trying to avoid being a spoiler here.] Well worth the price of admission.",1417046400,,605,5.247422680412371

8295679,4,B001DZOBZG,"I am a big Paul Gross fan. I prefer him in the role of the good guy, but I was impressed by his ability to play a rather morally ambiguous character. I got the sense the character thought he was doing what he did for the 'right' reasons. Or did he?

The story was intriguing and complex, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1394755200,,316,4.096774193548387
8295680,5,B001DZOBZG,"Gripping and thought provoking - in fact a bit frigthening. Utterly satifying yet left me wanting more. If I were to tell you why it might spoil it all for you - so you'll have to watch it for yourself. You don't have to be of a particular nationality or ideaology to appreciate this film - you just need to be able to appreciate masterful handling of subject matter, a deep understanding of the human psyche and you need to love twists and turns. Well written, acted and directed. I got lost in it.",1364169600,,499,4.319148936170213
8295681,5,B001DZOBZG,"Surprising right to the very end, engaging, thought provoking and the acting is excellent. Characters you love and characters you love to hate all the while rooting for their redemption. A must see with companion H2O. Paul Gross is superb.",1358899200,,239,5.0
8295682,5,B001DZOBZG,"Apart from the fact that it's 3 hours long I really enjoyed this film. I'll be honest and say that I only watched it for Paul Gross but the writing and story and cast were very good.
I probably should have watched H2O first but it will be at my house with in the week.",1275868800,,268,3.890909090909091
