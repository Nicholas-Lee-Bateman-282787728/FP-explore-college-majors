8115138,3,B000EWGOTU,"When I first did this workout I thought it was an interesting change from my regular workouts, definately energizing, and the use of the light 2 and 5 pound weights for arm toning was great.  What bothered me about it was that the instructor, although perky & likeable enough, was not pregnant and looks barely out of high school.  On rare occasions a small pop-up window shows the 3rd trimester pregnant woman, but for one she's wearing black dumpy clothes so you can hardly see her belly (presumably so she won't distract from the instructor in her sassy workout clothes) and for two she seems way more in shape than any average pregnant woman.  Also, there are no heartrate checks - just reminders to listen to how you feel.

After several days of doing this workout I started feeling like maybe it was just too intense for a 7 month pregnant woman on her second pregnancy.  If you're in great shape already this might be for you, but if you're just the average gal in average shape I'd skip it.  I'd feel a little better about it if she really was pregnant but in the end I just can't trust the judgement of someone who has never experienced what it's really like and what you can reasonably expect your body to do safely.",1165363200,4,1226,4.475336322869955
8115139,5,B000EWGOTU,I am ending my first trimester and was excited to try a new workout program.  Not only is this great for when you are pregnant but it will be a great workout tool even after I have the baby.  It was quick yet covered the total body.  I would recommend this series to anyone looking to stay fit during and after your pregnancy.,1143676800,7,326,4.142857142857143
