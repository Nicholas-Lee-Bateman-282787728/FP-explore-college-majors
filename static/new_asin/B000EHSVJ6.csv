They also, fall fight off a large sea serpent! In Teenage Caveman, a young Robert Vaughn questions his existence and ends ups helping his tribe.

2520042,5,B000EHSVJ6,"I found these to be very entertaining. Teenage Caveman is the better of the two films, though both are fun.  Watch out, the ending of teenage caveman may surprise you.  It could have been written by Rod Serling.",1383955200,,211,4.526315789473684
2520043,2,B000EHSVJ6,"Roger Corman outdid himself when he produced this movie. Talk about chintzy! Shot on a shoestring budget (with one of the shoestrings shorter than the other one) much of the action was shot using a fake rowboat equipped with a fake Viking masthead filmed against the backdrop of faked storm footage projected on a screen behind the rowboat. Take it from me, you will not be impressed. In other words, the women are seen tossed and turned in heavy seas but their 50s style hairdos never get mussed up. I wanted see Jonathan Haze again after his performance in the masterpiece Little Shop of Horrors (the movie that set the standard for cheap productions). I knew nothing about Abbey Dalton or Susan Cabot, the female leads in the Viking movie. Jonathan did his own stunts and looked quite agile albeit all that leaping in the air with arms extended looked a bit silly. Speaking of silly-looking, the great sea serpent might have been borrowed from Kukla, Fran, and Ollie.  Though it was constructed out of felt, the monster held up surprising well in the storm tossed sea.
  Apparently some Norse men went on a voyage but never came home so their women mount an expedition to go and find them. Give the girls credit; they had to be a hardy bunch to attempt to navigate the Atlantic in what looks like a life boat with a rudimentary sail and rudder. They finally find the men enslaved by a ruthless tyrant and his homosexual son (he does not think the Viking women are all that special even though they are scantily clad in Minnesota Viking cheerleader outfits.)
  This one deserves its PG-13 as anyone over the age of thirteen would not have been allowed in the theater. I saw it in the movies when I was eleven. I remember leaving theater thinking three things: gee, the Viking ship looked like the miniature I saw in the toy shop the other day, the puppet sea monster did not look particularly threatening, and that Susan Cabot babe had to be the most beautiful woman this pre-pubescent lad had ever set eyes on.
  Buy this movie and you will have to treasure it for life as you cannot very well give it away in good conscience, so you may as well keep it.",1379548800,,2157,4.5295629820051415
2520044,4,B000EHSVJ6,"This two movie DVD features Roger Corman films that have fallen into the public domain and it has been priced accordingly. The postage and handling on these were more than the movies themselves (which worked out to something like a dollar and twenty cents apiece the day I bought them and they have probably gone up a bit since then because I don't see how the price could have gone down much more). The movies are cheap, were made cheaply back in the day, and they look like shoestring productions because they are. Despite the slim budgets, both films have features which make them worth watching.

 The film about the Viking Women and the Sea Serpent actually has a title that sounds like it could have been an obscure fragment from the Icelandic Saga, but the real reason to see it is that it features an all star cast of drive in movie beauties with its use of Abby Dalton, Becky Jones-Moreland, and Susan Cabot in leading roles. All three went on large roles in other moves, if not particularly better movies. Cabot's career was the shortest and I believe she retired not long after starring in ""The Wasp Woman"", another Corman film which has slipped into the public domain. Betsy Jones-Moreland also appeared in other Corman films and is particularly memorable as the title character in ""The Last Woman on Earth"" but she also had a long and fairly active career as a supporting actress. Abby Dalton's career highlight was the episode of the ""Hennessey"" televison series in which her character married Jackie Cooper who had the lead role in that fondly remembered series. More people tuned in to see that fictional wedding than just about anything that year that wasn't connected to politics or the space program.  Those aren't just any conventional beauties in the (realatively) skimpy viking women costumes; those are some prime obscure beauties. Throw in a bone simple plot and an unimpress sea serpent and you have sixty six minutes of more than adequate entertainment. My only regret is that I didn't get to see the movie at a drive in movie theater back in the day.

 I did see ""Teenage Caveman"" as the second half of the bill of fare at a drive-in when I was fifteen or sixteen and, if nothing else remembered the title and that it has Robert Vaughn in the lead role. If you haven't seen this one before, I won't give away the ending because it has a twist that may never have been very fresh but is memorable. ""Teenage Caveman"" is a better movie than it appears to be but you have to get almost all of the way through it before you'll realize it.

 All in all, the two movies are a good example of a drive-in movie double feature from the late fifties or early sixties, and for the price of admission, you will get your money's worth.",1375488000,,2748,4.573170731707317

2520047,5,B000EHSVJ6,"This old classic ( Viking Women and the Sea Serpent) has some of the worst special effects but who cares.  The story line was fun and the movie had human values which is really lacking in movies today.  This was just plain old fun.

2520048,4,B000EHSVJ6,"This DVD is worth buying for Teenage Caveman alone. Hadn't seen TC in 40 years, and I enjoyed it very much. Yes, the production values are weak and there's some silly stuff in the movie, but the underlying story is actually quite sensible and engaging. In brief, and without giving anything away, a curious teenager questions the established rules -- a perfectly reasonable theme for the 1950's (as well as today). The flick is best watched alone, as it's likely that negative comments and inappropriate laughter may emanate from other viewers. I'm really fond of the ending, which dramatically answers all questions and concerns. So turn off the lights, imagine you're a teenager in the 50's, and stick with TC until the finale.",1332547200,,729,4.934959349593496
2520049,4,B000EHSVJ6,"Both films were silly, and I expected nothing more and nothing less. We, of the Drive-In crowd, are still alive and don't forget.

2520063,3,B000EHSVJ6,"Roger Corman has said that he never made a film that didn't turn a profit. Since he spent only slightly more money on his movies than Ed Wood, and had access to hundreds of screens all over North America, you can be sure that his statement was ""right on the money"" ! His movies were aimed at a youth audience, pulled into theatres by memorable posters that often promised more thrills than the film delivered. At the same time, most of his films provided good, cheesy fun, and a number of talented people got their start in motion pictures by working for Mr. Corman (hello Jack Nicholson).

Both of the movies on this DVD fall into that ""so bad they're good"" category. I guess I'm one of those baby boomers who sometimes gets a kick out of the ""ouevre"" of Roger Corman, Bert Gordon and--yes--even the infamous Ed Wood ! Each film runs slightly more than an hour--is full screen, black and white with mono sound. I had no problems with the quality, but extras are scant--comments from Mr. Corman would have been a nice touch.

""The Saga of the Viking Women and their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent""--whew ! What a title ! For obvious reasons, it was usually referred to as ""Viking Women versus the Sea Serpent"" or something similar. Released in 1957, a number of Viking women--mostly models in short skirts--set sail to find their missing men. The leader of the group--nubile, Barbie-like Abby Dalton--is anxious to be reunited with her ""betrothed"". However, one of her ""shipmates"", who seems to have mystical powers (she talks to ""Odin"" a lot), also covets the same man--this nasty woman is played by Susan Cabot, soon to graduate to the leading role in Mr. Corman's ""The Wasp Woman""--in terms of acting, Ms. Cabot steals this movie, although she has very little ""competition"" !

After battling through a storm, and narrowly escaping the clutches of the titular Sea Serpent (don't get your hopes too high--this is no Ray Harryhausen picture !), our heroines crash-land on a shore where barbarians are waiting to enslave them. By sheer coincidence, these barbarians--led by sneering Richard Devon--are also holding the missing Viking men prisoner, including Ms. Dalton's fiancee ( Brad Jackson, a hunky, blond, vacant Troy Donahue type). Can these plucky Viking women help their men escape, and return to their homeland ? Do Sea Serpents have teeth ? !

""Teenage Caveman"" could be seen in theatres in 1958, and stars Robert Vaughn in the title role--is it churlish to suggest that Mr. Vaughn was a shade too ""mature"" for this role ? With Mr. Vaughn's subsequent success in ""A"" films and particularly television, ""Caveman"" is unlikely to be prominently featured on his resume. He plays a rebellious caveman who wishes to explore the ""forbidden"" zone. The village elders are not amused--to disobey the ""law"" means death ! Of course, this movie would be even shorter if his curiousity didn't get the better of him. His adventures result in encounters with quick sand, and some of the phoniest-looking monsters you are ever likely to see--stock-footage from movies like the 1940 version of ""One Million Years BC"" is shamelessly shown on a rear projection screen behind Mr. Vaughn and his friends. There is a love interest--blond starlet, Darah Marshall, quite fetching in an animal-skin outfit, gives our hero ""knowing looks"". She also has a skinny-dip scene--guys--don't get too excited ! After about an hour of unintentionally funny dialogue and situations, we have a ""surprise"" ending that actually surprises no viewer who has actually been paying attention.

Bottom line--even with low budget sets, special effects, actors etc., both films can still be a lot of fun, if you are in the mood to be ""exploited""--again--by the truly unique Roger Corman !",1148601600,,3764,4.9026687598116165
2520064,3,B000EHSVJ6,"When I see these double features I often wonder what the link between the two films is.  Certainly Roger Corman has created countless films so why were these two put together?  Both have a sense of defying authority and exploration.  But I feel the real link is that each film has some great danes that pursue the heroes.

In the first film we meet a group of Viking women who have been alone since their menfolk disappeared some time ago.  Some what to go and search while others want to stay.  A vote results in them setting out on the search.  But a great sea monster destroys their boat and strands them in a hostile land.  There the woman are made captive and find the surviving men of their clan.  Can they escape?  If they do can they get past the sea monster?  You will have to watch the film to find out the answers.

In the second film Robert Vaughn is a teenager with a lot of questions.  His clan lives in a cave and follow a strict law that forbids them from journeying anywhere even though the surrounding land appear more fertile than their own.  When Vaughn convinces some other youths to cross the forbidden river, a power struggle ensues in the clan.  Should Vaughn be killed for breaking the law?  What will the gods say?  What about the God Who Kills With a Touch?  Vaughn remains rebellious and knows that things could be much better for his people if they are not shackled by the law.

Both films are in black and white.  Both involve a lot of cave scenes.  Teenage Caveman has more monsters, creatures and effects.  Both have beautiful women in scanty outfits.  Both have mediocre acting.  Teenage Caveman even has a clip from She Creature.  In other words, they are very typical of early Corman.  If you like Roger Corman, you will like these.  The two go well together and make a decent double-feature.  Check them out.",1147046400,,1844,4.456456456456457

As a movie it is average telling the story of a young mans fight against supersition and religion trying to suppress knowledge,a fable for the present which is why i gave it a 4 star instead of a 3. It even comes with a suprise ending. A young man runs afoul of the tribes witch doctor who also likes the young mans women.the tribe is starving while across the river game and food look plentiful.the young man goes across the river andthe witch doctor tries to have him killed by the tribe for breaking the religous law forbidding it. This happens a few times and finally results in a showdown of the young man and the witch doctor and the afore mentioned suprise ending.

8109991,4,B000EHSVJ6,"A pair of so bad they're good 50's schlockers made by the famous and infamous Roger Corman.  The first, Viking Women and the Sea Serpent is about a passel of Vikettes that want their men back.  Seems the Vikers disappeared on a boat trip and left their women pining.  Off the girls go and end up in the land of grubby warriors holding the Vikers captive.  It takes the Vikettes to make their men man up and break free.  The title Sea Serpent only makes sporadic appearances until the end.  The second, Teenage Cavemen is about a young caveman with growing pains.  Seems he's always questioning his tribes laws and wondering what's on the forbidden area on the other side of a local river.  The quality of both films is OK but Teenage Caveman could use re-mastering.  The DVD, otherwise, is a good buy.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1475884800,,837,4.52
8109992,2,B000EHSVJ6,"Roger Corman has directed over fifty films (and at age ninety is still active as of this writing as a producer,) some of them, recognized classics of the B-movie genre, such as The Little Shop of Horrors, Bloody Mama, The St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and the series of Poe-inspired horror movies featuring Vincent Price, but many others so quickly and cheaply made that they are esteemed as classics of the ""so-bad-it's good"" genre.  These two films are firmly in the latter category. Viking Women has to do with a group of Viking women, of course, who set out on a voyage to discover why their husbands haven't returned from their latest expedition: battling sea monsters and a wicked king ensue.  Teenage Caveman, obviously made to take advantage of the 1950s brief fad for ""I was a teen-age ... "" films, is notable mostly for starring Robert Vaughn in what he said was the worst film he ever made. In both films production values are minimal -- I've seen worse, but not often -- the cast members look more like they belong in a 1950s TV ad for vacuum cleaners than in medieval Scandinavia or the Upper Paleolithic, and the acting, if it is no worse than you would expect in a high school play, is not any better. In short, these will appeal to bad movie fans and not to many others.  The visual and sound quality of this Cult Classics DVD is adequate.",1471564800,,1355,4.545081967213115
