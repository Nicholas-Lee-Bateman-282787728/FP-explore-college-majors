8005810,5,B00013D4EA,"I am a fanatic fan of Vlacil.  I have gone through hoops to be able to get the only four Region I films available, of which I already have seen three.  American viewers are being denied access to his films--no idea why.  But make no mistake.  The White Dove is his debut film and already a masterpiece without equal,  combining the arts: sculpture, cinema, architecture and, most of all, poetry.  Visual poetry, in which images are more powerful than words. Pure Beauty,",1410048000,,470,4.670731707317073
8005811,5,B00013D4EA,"I rented this movie at ""I Love Video"" in Austin a couple of years ago. I was at a loss as to what to check out because of their vast selection but luckily came across this, I ended up loving it. I got lost in the visuals and themes of the movie.",1395273600,,245,3.730769230769231
8005812,5,B00013D4EA,"This is simply one of the most beautiful, haunting films I've ever seen. Every frame is a work of art, an image filled with mystery & meaning & visual beauty; yet it's not merely a series of static shots, but a living narrative of quiet power & purity that stays with the viewer like a deeply moving dream.

The story is simplicity itself: a young girl's homing pigeon loses its way & winds up wounded in a cage-like apartment complex in Prague, where it's nursed back to health by the lttle boy who shot it with his air rifle. He's unaware of what he did at first, until the artist who lives in a studio atop the apartment building brings him the injured bird. Clearly he wants the boy to appreciate the gravity of what he's done on an idle, thoughtless whim.

At the same time, the young girl on her small island waits for the bird to return, hoping against hope that it's merely delayed & not dead. The absence of the bird changes her life & the lives of those around her just as much as its presence changes the life of the boy Michal, who is confined to a wheelchair after a fall -- but it's fear that keeps him there, not physical injury. As he tends to the bird, he begins his own healing.

Yet I don't want to make it sound glib or formulaic, like some Very Special Episode of a bad TV show. It's anything but that! In scene after scene, using almost no dialogue at all, director Frantisek Vlacil gives us stunning, breathtaking images that are metaphoric, symbolic, but absolutely straightforward. Shot in black & white, the cinematography is almost a character in itself, using shadows & light to express a wealth of emotions. At times I was reminded of such disparate films as ""Woman in the Dunes,"" ""The Red Balloon"" & ""White Mane,"" and the work of both Cocteau & Bergman; but it's never imitative of any of these creations, and possesses its own unique vision.

And what does it all mean? It yields many interpretations: political, spiritual, psychological, personal. It has a special place for the power of art, as embodied by the somewhat stern but sensitive artist Martin, whose work becomes dominated by images of birds after his initial rescue of the wounded bird. While open to intellectual analysis, it touches the soul before all else. Why it isn't more well-known puzzles me, because it's a small masterpiece. Most highly recommended!",1301270400,4,2355,4.5866983372921615
8005813,5,B00013D4EA,One of the best of Czech directors. and this is an amazing movie. I wanna Marketa Lazarova also. and Dym bramborove nate on DVD  ...,1221436800,,132,4.28
8005814,5,B00013D4EA,"Another reviewer is similarily undeterred and bemused by the absence of the Vlacil film, 'Marketa Lazarova', rated in the late 90s by Czech film buffs as the greatest film made in their country. Not bad for an early 60s effort. However, in that context, the Czech's were leaders in cinema and we, in Australia were only just recognizing the fact when the Communist era closed down that probing edge that we witness in masterpieces like Marketa. It's the only one of his films I have seen, and it inevitably will draw comparisons with Tarkovsy's, Rubelov, and not merely for its black and white treatment of a medieval tale. The intensity of each image, each frame is utterly thrilling, so much so that the, at times, convoluted if not confusing narrative, can be shelved as the power and pleasures of the photography seize you. Wonderful. Mine is issued by 'Second Run DVD' a fact that 'Sight & Sound' magazine recently promoted.",1203465600,5,929,4.8125
8005815,4,B00013D4EA,The most beautifull imagery that I ever seen in the movie. Marketa Lazarova is true chech poet. The black and white is just breath taking !,1076112000,4,139,4.384615384615385
