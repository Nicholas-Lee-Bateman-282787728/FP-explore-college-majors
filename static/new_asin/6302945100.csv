525224,5,6302945100,I watched Teenage Bonnie and Klepto clyde years ago really late on tv. I had forgotten about it for a couple of years and parts of the movie came back in my head. But I couldn't remember the title after searching for many months i finally came acrossed it. I was shocked at the price but couldn't resist. I purchased it online and it was worth every penny of it. It is an excellent movie. I reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys action and/or comedy. It has great twists and an excellent storyline!! Buy it today!!,1084147200,2,518,4.350515463917525
525225,5,6302945100,"One Night i was sitting up,watching TV,it had to of been like 3 or 4 am in the morning and on cable i saw ""Teenage Bonnie and Klepto Clyde""....Well,that was about 5 years ago and i've been searching for this movie ever since...I thought it was funny,and romantic to a point,suspenceful and thrilling even though we all basically knew what was gonna happen in the end...I really thought that the director put a great twist on a classic film....And great performances from 2 people you wouldn't expect to be in this movie. Scott Wolf (Ex-Bailey on ""Party Of Five"")and ex Evie from one of my favorite shows grwing up ""Out of this world""...I think her name is Maureen something...Overall i think this movie rocked....",998956800,4,713,4.758064516129032

7832659,4,6302945100,"Bonnie (played by Maureen Flannigan), the daughter of the new police commissioner, doesn't feel like going on to college.  Clyde (played by Scott Wolf), a high school student with a side job of flipping burgers, takes a fancy to Bonnie when they discover a mutual mania for stealing things.  Bonnie wants lighters, cassettes, and clothers; Clyde goes in for cars, microscopes, and random junk.  They discover that they have their very best sex right after committing a crime.  To keep the sex great, the crimes keep having to get bigger.  Soon the media and police are pressing as hard as they can to stop the crime spree.  Clyde starts hoping for more out of the relationship.

This film does a nice job of updating the famous Bonnie & Clyde film and keeps up a good energy level.  There are several skin scenes, not only of Bonnie & (especially) Clyde but also of three of Bonnie's ex-friends.  There are a number of scenes of violence by gunfire, with a mandatory slow-motion scene for the principals.",1185580800,5,1004,4.724137931034483
