8601532,5,B00E5O5Y4E,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

The main event was the second Iron Man Match in P.W.G. history as Adam Cole defended the P.W.G. Championship against Sami Callihan that started out with Cole being buried underneath chairs on the outside in the first minute & didn't let up from there as various highlights include the multiple back to back falls, Sami delivering a release powerbomb into the ring post followed by beating on him with chairs & beer pictures, Sami delivering a chokeslam but it wasn't his neck that was choked, a moment where Cole beat Sami all the way back to the bathroom & the fans refused to have him get counted out, various references to an ""electrifying"" wrestler/actor from using his moves to even at one time Cole doing commentary on his own match, both men using the other's signature move on them, and exchanging chops for a minute straight.  Kevin Steen vs. Drake Younger in their first ever meeting that had brawling on the outside & wrestling on the inside that saw so many moves on & off the the apron into the crowd along with one suplex that actually bounced the other guy out of the ring while Kevin Steen kept having a verbal battle with a loud fan at ringside.  Other matches include the final appearance of Samuari Del Sol teaming with A.R. Fox against Young Bucks that saw A.R. at one point do multiple back to back to back springboards leading to a bulldog that I've never seen get so much velocity on before as both teams pulled out all the stops & flew all over the place, Dojo Bros vs. Chuck Taylor & Johnny Gargano that had it's comedic moments with Taylor find a way to protect himself from Edwards & Stong's chops, Kyle O'Riley vs. Davey Richards in a ""student vs. teacher"" battle that was very competitive based off strikes & submissions including one moment where a stalemate had to be decided by ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" while also seeing signs of the sleazy side of Richards, and RockNES Monsters vs. Unbreakable F'n Machines in a ""power vs. agility"" match.

This event was had matches full of everything you could ask for as a fan from physical exchanges to submission wrestling to entertaining moments to high flying to even emotional moments such as knowing that this was not only the last show for Sami Challihan, complete with a farewell speech, so this is an event that I would recommend for any fan to see.",1377734400,2,2667,4.7290322580645165
