6403873,5,B00K6MPBN8,"This was an excellent series, in the spirit of the PBS house series of films.  There was a good focus on the actual work that would have been done and a determination for the most part to be period correct.  There was less melodrama between people and more actual focus on how life was back in the 1870's.  Excellent series.",1417392000,7,324,4.366666666666666
6403874,5,B00K6MPBN8,I have been looking for this for years.  For a long time it was only on VHS.  This is such a well done story.  I will treasure this!  There have been other stories like this but the 21st century still seemed to be in their brain.  In this one you really felt how the pioneers must have felt with the different hardships.  I will watch it again.,1415404800,10,344,4.059701492537314

6403876,5,B00K6MPBN8,"I copied this on a VCR as it was running thru 8 episodes, trying to rerun it now on another VCR the reception was not too good, so took a chance to see if it was now on Amazon. It shows the life of two couples  battling mother nature, they were only to live there one year, then they had feelings about leaving. They built cabins, trying to live off the land and there were pioneer lessons to be learned.",1404086400,,404,4.05
6403877,1,B00K6MPBN8,Not authentic...with animal abuse....so sad that this is alowed to be happen. Production failed and so did partisipants.....sorry I can't do negative stars.....was excited at the idea but heartbroken by the lack of planning and execution.,1478044800,,238,5.638888888888889
6403878,5,B00K6MPBN8,"I loved this, this is a reality show, a real reality show. Would recommend to all who are interest in that Era. Also great service from seller!",1475625600,6,143,4.333333333333333

6403880,3,B00K6MPBN8,Audio wasn't the greatest at certain points on the DVD copy. Otherwise it's great.,1466985600,5,82,4.928571428571429
6403881,5,B00K6MPBN8,Hadn't seen this reality show since it first aired approx 15 years ago.  It was as enjoyable as I remembered it.,1465516800,,112,4.333333333333333
6403882,5,B00K6MPBN8,"In my opinion this is a wonderful experiment both for what is loosely termed ""reality tv"" and boiling the human condition down to basics. The show often commented on the impossibility for many reasons of making it absolutely authentic because of tradeoffs.  in some ways the original pioneers had it harder as there was no ""safety net"" but they also had a huge advantage in knowledge and experience, growing up with it even as small children.  In contrast these four sturdy people spent much of their time just learning what to do and how.  However that, to me, is not the heart of the story.  The real story is all about what is truly essential and that is where this show shines. I can't imagine anyone not happily surprised at this truly human story whether a Futurist or a Luddite.  It has something important for everyone.",1465344000,,827,4.636986301369863
6403883,5,B00K6MPBN8,Great series . enjoyed every minute of it even the sad parts,1446940800,,60,4.083333333333333
6403884,5,B00K6MPBN8,"One of my favourite re-enactment series.  Great couples and crew, and good wholesome family entertainment which is educational.",1441324800,,127,6.055555555555555

6403886,5,B00K6MPBN8,"Love this program. Not overly dramatic, just an honest look into the lives of these couples as they take on the daunting task of living as the pioneers did. Very well done.",1435536000,,172,4.40625
6403887,5,B00K6MPBN8,So great!,1434326400,,9,4.0
6403888,3,B00K6MPBN8,"Of two documentaries on pioneering - Pioneer Quest and Frontier House - I liked Frontier House better.  Pioneer Quest simply tests the determination of two couples to endure and outlast one of Canada's worst years on record for torrential rain and freezing temps. to secure a prize of $100,000 (Canadian) each if they succeeded.  While period tools/equipment are used, no historical comment is offered as to laws, conditions, or mores of life c1880 that prompted pioneers to head West or what directly affected them once there. (Could women own property; were they allowed to homestead?  How far would settlers normally have to travel to find a store for provisions?)  I was also greatly disappointed neither couple embraced any changes in their 21 C living.  One couple went back to their 4,000 sq/ft mega-mansion, hired an agent, and hit the road touring on speaking engagements as celebraties.  It's noted not all neighbors got along in Frontier House but neither were things always peaceful in Pioneer Quest.  At one point, even the show's producer had to ask one couple to stop engaging outside locals for help them -  neighbors being few and far between for early settlers.  Pioneer Quest -  just so-so.",1432944000,16,1209,5.0
6403889,5,B00K6MPBN8,Thanks for the great show,1431907200,,25,4.2
6403890,5,B00K6MPBN8,"I absolutely have adored this show. In my opinion the older couple, especially the wife wasn't in to making it as close to real as possible, but that seemed to be true of the whole production. The producers were often late with things to provide them with, or even historically accurate. I would say if you are looking to educate yourself on a accurate portrait of pioneer life in the 1800's. This is probably not the show to get that from. However, for just pure enjoyment and entertainment it is wonderful. Very interesting and captivating.",1427932800,5,542,4.71578947368421
6403891,4,B00K6MPBN8,"I absolutely adored watching this collection of movies this past winter.  I believe I watched them straight through for three days! I had a bad cold! It was like staying up all night reading a good book, and you just couldn't put it down.  If you ever wondered how you would survive in the wilderness, like the pioneers did many years ago, you will enjoy these films!  My one criticize would be to use familys with many children,as the first settlers undoubtedly had.  The work load would have been divveyed up, and challenges to feed every one would have been interesting.",1426723200,11,573,4.643564356435643
6403892,5,B00K6MPBN8,"Super Program.  Watched it on TV and always wanted to get the series on DVD. It is a reality series where two couples worked together to build and establish homes on the prairies (over a one year duration).
If you like pioneer history, the trials in setting up a homestead--get it.  Great series--Wonderful People.  Good study in Canadian history--the trials in setting up a homestead on the prairies and the strength of character required of  the ""pioneers"".",1423958400,9,459,4.922077922077922
6403893,5,B00K6MPBN8,"I saw this on Hulu, and I bought a set for a friend who I knew would enjoy it as much as I did. It was interesting to see how people from 2000 tried to adapt to living as a 19th century pioneer. The people had a background in hunting and carpentry, and they had a hard time living as a pioneer. Can you imagine if the typical urban office worker tried doing this? I don't know if the people would have been able to do this in 2015 because without Facebook and being able to get lattes from starbuck's, would anyone survive?",1423872000,4,523,4.087378640776699

6403896,5,B00K6MPBN8,"A great series. Far superior to Frontier House which chose to focus on arguments, backbiting and complaining. This show is the one to have if you want to see how things were really done in the olden days. A very well done show.",1421107200,26,227,4.3023255813953485

8656382,1,B00K6MPBN8,"It is stunning to see the amount of animal cruelty that was allowed to generate a cash prize. Allowing a PREGNANT animal to perish in flames, absolutely horrible and stunning to see.
The actors/ crew/ producers or anyone who makes money from the sale or distribution of this sham of a living history experiment should be ashamed of themselves.
Completely ruined a Friday night.
Should be removed from Amazon Prime.",1502409600,2,414,4.928571428571429
