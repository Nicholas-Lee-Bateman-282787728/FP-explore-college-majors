7880726,4,6305021317,"The movie is great, the quality of the VHS tape is bad. The movie has several plots going on at the same time and really keeps your interest. I had seen the movie several times which is why I purchased it. However, I am very disappointed in the quality of the tape.",1411084800,,265,4.115384615384615
7880727,4,6305021317,The movie itself was good but it was annoying that it is part of the Virginian series which I already have.  Otherwise good acting and writing.,1281830400,,143,4.5
