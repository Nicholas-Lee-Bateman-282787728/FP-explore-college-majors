I was looking to see if there was another dvd set that I missed...no, the end is the end and it was SO BAD. The acting is really bad also. The only good part of this movie is the scenery.",1331251200,3,295,3.6984126984126986
7991525,1,B00009ME9V,"I usually love these types of movies, but this one is the worst!  Very, very slow moving and it takes over half of the movie to make any sense and then you are hooked.  The second half is depressing and the acting is stagnant at best throughout.  The ending is horrible.  I wish I had not bought this!",1222646400,5,301,4.137931034482759
