8542396,2,B009K9R51E,"I ordered this Level 3 DVD, with expectations of getting a challenging aerobic workout while using my experience as a ballroom dancer.  Louis Van Amstel is a great instructor and professional ballroom dancer, and the tutorials are clear with step-by-step instructions.  However, the workout itself is very disappointing.  There are six dances, and each must be selected individually.  Each dance routine lasts approximately 3 minutes -- which gives you less than 20 minutes of workout with pauses between each to select the next dance.  For a DVD which purports to be a high-level of intensity, and runs a total of 64 minutes,  the aerobic workout is insufficient, and not even constant for 20 minutes, which prevents the continuous elevated heart-rate that is essential for a good aerobic workout.  Probably will not use this DVD again -- that says it all.",1434326400,,857,5.078571428571428
