8366540,3,B002DZNLGK,"Disappointed with dvd set. I could have bought one and got the same duplicate data from anyone of them. They don't include a sketch of the animals that they are showing how to do; so you really can't follow along with her. Also, she talks a lot and pauses to talk at several spots and seems to rush toward the end to show finished project. Every dvd is about the same thing just using different sketches of different animals. I am keeping the set because it is a pain to return things. But, if you are a beginner and want to know how to paint animal fur this might help you after you practiced a lot and I would pick anyone dvd not the whole set. It does sort of give you an ideal about which brush to make different strokes and what products to use to do it. I was not really impressed. Hope it works out better for you if you buy it.",1317168000,,835,4.066666666666666
