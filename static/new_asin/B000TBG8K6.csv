8291007,2,B000TBG8K6,"This should really be called Nana (instead of Ming Ming) because that's the name of the other of the two characters Zhou Xun plays; the one who has the orange hair, quite a bit more screen time, and a better story line if you could separate them. This is NOT a martial arts film unless you consider flinging marbles and flicking matches at people martial arts. I thought it was silly. Director Susie Au obviously comes from a music video background. I found the random quick and quirky edits tiring, although they did set up the actors with wonderfully posed portraits throughout. Daniel Wu has an awesome hairdo if you go for that kind of thing. Zhou Xun's Cantonese is quite fetching and ordinarily I could watch her all day long. She's one of the more engaging actresses from China. (See her in ""The Equation of Love and Death"" or ""Painted Skin"") It's too bad that the director's heavy-handed style gets in the way of enjoying this film where identity is an ambiguous thing.",1243555200,,977,4.620689655172414
