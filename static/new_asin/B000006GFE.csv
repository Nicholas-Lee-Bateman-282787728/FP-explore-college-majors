7904273,4,B000006GFE,"I bought this movie on Amazon.com. I enjoyed the first two Porky's movies,this one tops the icing on the cake. It's funny to watch in some scenes of movie which seem to stand out. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh once in while.",1181952000,,252,4.270833333333333

7904275,5,B000006GFE,"This movie is an excellent follow-up to the first two Porky's flicks; although some say it's better than the second one.  This time, Pee-Wee & the gang are about to graduate from Angel Beach High. Two characters are missing: Tim & Mickey.  What happened to them?  And bringing in a buxom exchange student from Sweden (Kim Evenson) was totally unnecessary.  Although I enjoyed the boys' antics, I didn't care for Wendy (Kaki Hunter) in this installment.  She picked on Pee-Wee in the first Porky's, cared about him in the second one & went back to picking on him in this flick.  The most touching scene is when Miss Balbricker is reunited with her high school sweetheart, Snooky Kelton.  And don't forget Porky himself, this time his establishment is on a boat. (His first club was destroyed in the first flick).  It's all here: jokes, blackmail, & revenge.  If you enjoyed the first two Porky's or are just curious about this flick, sit back, watch & enjoy yourself!",1094428800,7,966,4.736526946107785
7904276,3,B000006GFE,"THIS TIME, PORKY AND HIS NIGHTCLUB [WHICH IS NOW ON A BOAT] RETURNS. THE BASKETBALL COACH OWES MONEY TO PORKY, TO CLEAR HIS DEBT, HE AGREES TO PURPOSELY LOSE THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE SOFTER IN TERMS OF THE NUDITY THAT THE FIRST TWO. THIS WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER PORKY'S 2 AND IT'S UP THERE WITH PORKY'S 1. FOR A GOOD FUN TIME, CHECK THIS SEQUEL OUT.",1059091200,3,372,4.253521126760563
7904277,4,B000006GFE,"Porky's Revenge marks the return of Porky and his establishment. This time Porky has a casino on a riverboat and the basketball coach owes a great debt to Porky. To clear his debt the coach has agreed to throw the State Championship game. Tommy,Pee Wee,and Meat are back as well as the rest of their buddies. Much more entertaining than Porky's 2. The graduation part is great too. If you liked the first Porky's movie check this one out.",1050969600,3,438,4.556962025316456
7904278,4,B000006GFE,"Most of the gang from Angel Beach High is back, and they're preparing for graduation.  Trouble abounds when their basketball coach gets in hock with Porky over gambling debts, and is ordered to throw the state championship game-or else.  In between tangling with their old nemesis, the boys ""help"" Meat pass his biology exam by blackmailing the teacher, Pee-Wee becomes enamored of Inga, the attractive exchange student from Sweden, and they're still locking horns with the diabolical Ms. Balbricker.  Lots of fun for fans of the series.  I've heard rumors about a fourth movie but nothing definite yet.  Veteran TV director James Komack took over direction from Bob Clark and does a good job, adding a different kind of look for this sequel.  Recommended.",983923200,3,756,5.056451612903226
