If you're looking for a solid little low-budget action flick that delivers just the right amount of awesome, action, and 80's vibe, then this is the film for you.

This tale of revenge and double-crosses centered around the Yakuza clan, the Chinese Tong, and father and son war veterans came at a time when I was struggling to find anything good after a string of terrible or mediocre action films. You'd think it would be easy to make these, but apparently it's not, because I kept throwing on dud after dud until finally getting around to this one and being pleasantly surprised....finally.

I think one of the biggest surprises for me was that this was directed by Fred Olen Ray, a filmmaker with questionable ability for most of his career. Honestly, without sounding too much like a jerk, this is probably the only film of his that I've seen that I genuinely like. I admit that I haven't seen a lot of his vast filmography, but one thing I've noticed is that the quality of his work is never consistent. A lot of it is just terrible, with most of it being dismissive. But somehow, in some way, all the stars aligned for this one effort and while it's not a great piece of work, it's one helluva fun B-Movie in the action genre.

Aside from the fact that Ray actually turned out a solid film, the casting of this thing is just fantastic. First and foremost, you have the legends Lee Van Cleef and David Carradine. But it's really the little bit parts filled to the brim with genre icons that really stand out like Micheal Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes), Brent Huff (Strike Commando 2, Born to Fight), Mako (Conan the Destroyer, The Perfect Weapon), Dick Miller (!!!), Laurene Landon (Maniac Cop 1 & 2), and David Goss (Hollywood Cop). Man, what a fantastic cast all around for such a small film.

I'm not going to lie to you and say that this is one of the best low-budget action movies I've ever seen, because it's not. But it sure is one helluva good time in this little niche department. It's got a great cast, a fun vibe, and shockingly, it's made competently well. Too bad Ray couldn't keep up with this type of quality of work. If anything, Armed Response shows that the guy has the goods. In some ways you can compare him to Jim Wynorski. Both filmmakers have tackled pretty much every genre imaginable, but really hit their mark in the horror genre, before settling into softcore porn for the majority of their later career, only to strangely segway into family friendly comedies now and then. They both really left their mark though with a low-budget horror flick; Wynorski with Chopping Mall (1986), and Ray with Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers (1988). It's a shame that even though they both deliver multiple films a year - and still continue to, they have never been able to capture the magic of these early offerings in their careers.

Armed Response was awesome, plain and simple. Give it a shot, should the mood for this type of film strikes you. You won't be disappointed.",1476489600,,3157,4.600355239786857
7996840,3,B0000ADXFE,"The 3-stars is for the quality of the actual disc received, which looks no better than my old VHS copy. At one point in the film, you can even see an 'analog artifact' similar to tracking on a VHS tape. On Amazon, this was advertised as being manufactured/distributed from Echo Bridge, but what I received was a copy manufactured/distributed by Platinum, who are known for poor quality DVDs/transfers. Echo Bridge isn't really that much better, but I'm generally disappointed, especially for the price that I paid. Since the inception of DVDs - and it's been a while now - that industry hasn't lived up to the hype of ""better quality"". Blu Ray has been out for a while and that promise has been better-kept, but still not to the level of all the hype and hoopla. It's no wonder why both DVD and Blu Ray are going the way of the dodo...but still, there is no real standard for video. There are some good companies out there, but they're too few. I hope that in the future, this film gets some better treatment, perhaps from the likes of Synapse, Scorpion, Shout! Factory, or even Kino Lorber - who are all generally good companies that have better standards.",1472860800,,1157,4.594202898550725
7996841,4,B0000ADXFE,"I really like this movie its great fun, a low budget yet action packed adventure directed by Fred Olen Ray who did many small budget movies throughout the 80's and the 90's including Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers! Many of his movies were cheesy sleazy horrors and sci-fi with blood and nudity, this is his attempt at an action movie and I think it plays out pretty well, the story is basically set in the seedy underworld of Los Angeles Chinatown, a yakuza boss has a priceless statue stolen which he will do anything to get back, but they mess with the wrong family! The cast is great' David Carradine is a cool lead and the rest of the support cast is good, a few familiar faces pop up for small roles like Michael Berryman (hills have eyes) Laurene Landon (Maniac Cop 1-2) and others, there is plenty of action in the way of shoot-outs and explosions etc all on a low but decent budget, if you love these classic cheesy low rent movies then make sure you get this one especially as you can pick it up so cheap!!",1419379200,2,1011,4.382978723404255

7996843,5,B0000ADXFE,"A very nice print of this classic 1986 actioner starring David Carradine and Lee Van Cleef with a nice turn by Mako as the head villian. Ross Hagen, Michael Berryman, Laurene Landon and Lois Hamilton also turn in good performances. Add it to your collection today.",1202860800,5,264,4.760869565217392
7996844,3,B0000ADXFE,"Despite Van Cleef's age, it's kinda a joy to see

he and Carradine (both vets of many of these kind

of pics) together as Father and Son vet team (!!)

taking on the evil and murderous Mako over stolen

jade artifact. Many recognisable faces here and all

do well in their roles (especially Mr. 'The Hills

Have Eyes, Berryman). If not taken too seriously,

it's a good 'Guy's Actioner'. Fred Olen Ray and

Carradine did three good cheapies together (and

Dawn Wildsmith was in all three)!",1143244800,11,489,4.593023255813954
