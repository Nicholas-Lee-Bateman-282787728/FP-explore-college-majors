2332619,4,B0009X7BD2,"Even though his name is never revealed during the course of the British crime thriller, ""Layer Cake,"" we get to know the hero very well, very fast.

""I'm not a gangster,"" he explains. ""I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.""

This guy, identified as XXXX in the end credits, deals only in neatly wrapped kilos; he employs a smart chemist, a slick accountant and a loyal posse of heavies; he has a legitimate business on the side and he tools around London in a sleek silver Audi (station wagon).

And while he might be a ""T-shirt and jeans"" kind of guy, he sports very expensive-looking T-shirts and jeans.

Of course, the only reason crime thrillers stress the professionalism of their main characters is so we can watch as circumstances eventually force them to break their own rules and pay a stiff price.

Those circumstances appear in the form of Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham) a grumpy upper-level gangster who summons XXXX and demands two sketchy favors of him. XXXX complies and quickly finds himself up to his earlobes in thugs, mols, Serbian assassins and the kind of bottom-feeders he likes to shun.

""Layer Cake"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who previously produced Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" All three movies have a lot in common but Ritchie's amped-up films bounce off the walls and onto the ceiling; Vaughn's is colder and more calculating - to use a Brit pop analogy, if Ritchie's movies are akin to the strutting, pub brawlers Oasis, Vaughn's is the orchestral-but-grooving The Verve.

Eventually, though, the plot becomes ridiculously complicated. While it is possible to make sense of all the scams and double-crosses, the movie is a lot more interesting when it focuses on characters instead of twists and coincidences and two particularly exaggerated violent beatings. By the last act, the movie is just chasing its own tail... and yet, somehow, it's a hard movie to dislike.

Despite its terrible title (a euphemism for the gangster hierarchy) but it oozes cool: XXXX is played by Daniel Craig who could almost be a gaunt, slightly freeze-dried Steve McQueen circa ""Bullitt"" ; the great Michael Gambon shows up as a phlegmatic, aging tiger of a mob boss; Sienna Miller wanders through long enough to model lingerie to the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" ; and though this is his first film, Vaughn really knows how to move a story along with style.

If he can keep the plot from overwhelming the characters next time around, he might turn out to be a really good director.",1120089600,35,2539,4.886046511627907
2332620,4,B0009X7BD2,"This film suffers because it comes from the same stable as Lock Stock and Snatch. The reason it suffers is that people expect a Lock Stock 3.  It isn't.  There's a new director in the chair and the film is a lot darker and edgier than the other two.

The first two were black comedies; this one isn't.

This movie won't have large shoot-outs, but what it will have is a movie with a very strong undercurrent of fear going through the lead's final days in business before he retires.  But, retirement is not going to be easy.

Things start to go terribly wrong and one can feel the world coming out from under his feet as events outside of his control are starting to take over and things are going totally wrong.

This is not a film where a grand comical shoot out occurs in the last scenes to leave the anti-heroes (they're all bad bad guys not nice bad guys, remember) with the girl and the loot as in Snatch or Lock Stock.  Things have to be resolved their own way.

The acting is wonderful; the characters (hoorah!) don't look like gangsters which is the whole point, despite complaints here to the contrary.  The lead characters want to go through life without drawing attention to each other so there's no-one acting like cheap hoodlumns from Central Casting.

There's a couple of wonderful touches and, in one of them, I take my hat off to FCUK for their bravery in one of the early scenes.  Wonderful stuff.

In short, a good film.  Certainly the best British gangland film made so far; above Long Good Friday (even though nothing will surpass THAT ending) and Get Carter.  And, a different film whatsoever to Lock Stock and Snatch.

If you want a film which requires thought then get this one, if you want a Hollywood style mob film with a simplistic plot then get another.  This is most certainly not a Saturday night no-brainer movie; this is a classic British film.",1119312000,7,1877,4.489675516224189
2332621,2,B0009X7BD2,"On a one to five rating, this one dropped from a four to a two in the last ten seconds.  I want to defend this statement, but yet avoid giving the specifics of what happened.  Let me just say that the ending was not organically connected with the rest of the movie, but felt tacked on.  In any good movie, all the various bits need to be in some sense connected from beginning to end.  Otherwise, some bit might be narratively unconnected with all the rest.  Unfortunately, here a profoundly random ending was stapled onto the very end, completely altering the meaning of everything that went before.  Now, I can easily imagine various explanations why the film was given the ending it had, but the truth of the matter is that all of these explanations will be things brought from outside the film to explain something inside it.  Flowing from the movie itself, the ending is utterly without narrative meaning.

Before the ending, I hadn't thought it was a perfect film, but I did think it was a fairly enjoyable one.  I felt that the exposition of the story was a tad muddled at times and that visually the film sometimes revealed Matthew Vaughan's background as a producer rather than a director, but there was a fabulous collection of characters, and I very much enjoyed their interaction with one another.  Daniel Craig in particular was fabulous in the central role, but many other superb actors fill out the large number of parts.  Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon in particular are superb in their rols, but the film keeps coming back to Craig and his steely blue eyes.

The plot revolves around a highly disciplined cocaine dealer who suddenly finds himself in an intensely chaotic situation.  He quickly finds that his code and plans are useless when confronted with the messiness of real life (which is also the point of the rather stupid ending--but it is a point that was so clearly made earlier that an ending more in keeping with the rest of the story would have been better, an ending that shows that good philosophy doesn't always lead to good narrative).  Daniel Craig's character (we never learn his name) is pulled into a couple of messes, one involving consumating a drug buy with some extremely unprofessional crooks who have stolen a large amount of pills from a Serbian drug lord and the other the hunt for a magnate's drug abusing daughter.  He finds that the drug buy was a set up and the search for the daughter actually the search for someone to use as a hostage.  Things get messier and messier, but our hero manages to pull things more or less together despite multiple bumps in the road, until the rather unpleasant and unexpected ending.

I'm not sure whether to recommend this film to others or not.  Until the tacked on ending, it was a fairly enjoyable film.  I have read that Guy Ritchie had been slated for a long time to direct it.  He and Matthew Vaughan had collaborated on LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH, but the magic that was contained in those two films was lacking here (as it was in the fiasco they jointly created in SWEPT AWAY).  Perhaps Ritchie's abscence was the difference.  Perhaps it was the screenplay, which was produced by the author of the novel.  For whatever reason, the film as a whole is less successful by a considerable margin than the two films that preceded it, and its ending is among the worst I've ever seen in a film.  I guess my first recommendation would be to see it, but try to cut out a few seconds before it stutters to an end.",1117843200,5,3515,4.5872
2332622,5,B0009X7BD2,"In this slick British gangster movie Daniel Craig plays an anonymous cocaine dealer known only as XXXX. As criminals go, Mr. Craig plays by the rules. He keeps a low profile, isn't overly greedy, and he checks out carefully his clients before he sells to them. When the movie opens, he's trying to retire; but if that were a possibility, we wouldn't have this film that takes the cake.

The movie delivers on just about every level. The fast moving plot is intricate and convoluted; there's enough killing for the most blood-thirsty theatregoer; and Mr. Craig, who is in practically every scene, is icing on this cake. In Many of the frames he bears a striking resemblance to Steve McQueen. This movie is not to be missed for his performance alone. Perhaps Mr. Craig will become the next James Bond.",1117497600,6,799,4.707142857142857
2332623,4,B0009X7BD2,"Layer Cake is a complicated movie with, oddly enough, many layers.  You really need a scorecard with this type of movie.  There's the gang lead by Daniel Craig (unnamed in the movie, and credited as a string of X's), which tends to use the services of a higher up gang lead by Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), with Colm Meaney (Gene) the contact between the two gangs, most of the time.  Jimmy's tossed Craig two business opportunities, one a ""favor"" and the other more in line with Craig's business.  The ""favor"" involves tracking down the missing daughter of a powerful ""friend"" of Jimmy's (the girls done a ""runner"" from a drug rehab center; this powerful ""friend"" has a gang of his own, though he is more mainstream than the others, most of them, though, including Craig, have legitimate covers).  The business opportunity involves Duke's gang (lead by Duke - Jamie Foreman).  Duke's gang of amateur's is trying to break into the business, and have something like a million pills for sale.  Pills they acquired in Amersterdam from another gang.  Pill's they stole from this ""Serbian"" gang (I believe that's what they kept calling that gang), and the Amersterdam gang has sent off a hired killer named Dragon (maybe that's the Serbian) to get the pills back and ""settle"" matters (he is known for taking heads).

Well, Craig's the main focus of the movie and is currently working on two jobs (both for Jimmy's gang).  He has sent off two others (whose connection to Craig I didn't figure out, though I believe they are contract workers) to search for the girl, while Craig personally handles the Duke business (with backing from people from Jimmy's gang, including his right hand man Colm Meaney).  Another gang enters the picture in the form of the buyers from ""up north,"" Trevor's gang (Trevor - played by Louis Emerick).  Craig's character is a well-organized business like guy that doesn't particularly like guns.  Jimmy is an older guy with odd tendencies to curse, but he is another one that believes that the drug trade should be handled like a business.  Duke's gang has the loud, flashy, somewhat disorganized style of operations.  Jimmy's ""friend"" is more mainstream than Jimmy, but still a criminal (his ""gang members"" are ex-military personnel).  The other two gang's, Trevor's and the Amerstadam one, are harder to determine.

The acting is superb, not a bad apple in the bunch.  The plot is strong and has, as the saying goes, many layers.  The setting is interesting, showing a side of London I do not normally see (along with scenes from other locations).  And the music is good.  Overall, I would give the movie 4.38 stars.  The movie is directed by Matthew Vaughn and written by J.J. Connelly based on his book.

I had gone to see this movie because it starred Daniel Craig, an individual with Bond rumors surrounding him (that he could be the individual playing the 007 role in the next Bond movie, Casino Royale).  I came away with the impression that Craig could adequately play the Bond role, though he would have a harder looking face (more weathered) than has played the part in the past.  There are even moments in the movie where Craig with a gun looks very much like Bond.

2332624,5,B0009X7BD2,"And bring me a bottle of whipped cream for Daniel Craig, who is threatening to unseat Jude Law as THE penultimate male human currently in residence on the planet. The rumor is that he will be the next James Bond and I think it would revitalize the lame 007 series, as Daniel Craig has that cool, amused, and yet dangerous masculine grace that Sean Connery had. He brings to mind Steve McQueen, but without the petulance. And without the turtleneck sweater.

""Layer Cake"" is a smashing addition to the britster genre. There is something more appealing about British no-good-niks as compared to our American variety. Even the way they swear seems, well, civilized. Daniel Craig plays the hero of this frenetic movie, smugly assuring us that he is a ""businessman"" whose trade is illegal drugs. His life is all icy calm and he's in control and about to retire at the top of his game. I say, old chap: fuggedaboutit. How little control over his life he actually has is slowly revealed during the course of the movie, during which everything goes awry. It starts with a command from the local boss to find a woman, the daughter of ""an old friend"". There's a shipment of a million ecstasty tabs stolen from some Serbian mobsters (seriously bad dudes...the scariest in the movie), an attempt to move them, the Serbians want them back, and the ""old friend"" (Eddie, played by the inestimable Michael Gambon looking like an embalmed goat in a perfect suit) steps in to show everyone what is really going on. The plot is very convoluted and in fact, I recommend not trying to think too much but instead to pay attention and let it all wash over you. All will be revealed in the end, after about 6 twists which come breathlessly fast. And you'll be going ""Ohhhh!!!"".

There is a lot of religious iconography in this movie, including the fact that our our central hero has no name. He teases us with this fact at the final denouement near the end of the movie. I enjoy picking this stuff out and it was not too heavy-handed with the exception of the shower/baptism scene. The filming was pretty good even though the editors were a bit over-exuberrant. Colm Meaney excels, and look how far he has come since his Star Trek (eeeeee!) days.

2332625,4,B0009X7BD2,"A successful cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig) wants to retire. Everyone seems to know this and wants him to help with one last project, errand or favor. Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham), his boss, wants him to help find the daughter of a rival, Eddie (Michael Gambon). The daughter has slipped into drugs and has gone missing. Gene (Colm Meaney) and his crew want his help with one last large order of E pills from Amsterdam. He also meets Sammy (Sienna Miller), the girlfriend of a rival, and falls in love. Of course, none of this is going to be as simple as all that.

""Layer Cake"", the new British gangster film from director Matthew Vaughn, is the latest in a string of stylish films depicting gangsters and drug dealers produced by the same people who worked on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"".

Much like the earlier films by Guy Ritchie, ""Layer Cake"" has a sweeping visual style. I don't mean that the style is grand, but the camera moves a lot. The movements are very fluid and stylish and this helps to add a lot of visual panache to the film. Following the character played by Daniel Craig (who is not named in the film) as he walks towards a door, the camera may then pick up another character as they walk out of a door in another building. Or the camera may focus on a golf ball in one persons hand and the shot changes to a close-up on another character's eye.

A character might relate a story, as the camera pans across the room, moving across a doorway, into the room where the story is set. We then watch the images of the story, as the character describes them. Frequently, the camera continues moving out of the room and back into the room of the story teller. The transition is usually brief but effective. Watching the other events keeps things moving, but also keeps them interesting, because we are looking at a visual of the events being described, rather than just listening to a description.

Because of these transition elements, there are very few traditional `cuts' in the film, allowing the viewer to really lose themselves in the story. It is an effective way to bring us into this world. To help us believe that we are a part of the story and the action.

This is also the type of film where everyone has the same facial expression throughout. They're gangsters. They are supposed to be heartless bastards. Normally, this would drive me crazy, but in this film, it works. Craig's character is not quite the hardened criminal that he portrays. He is a normal guy, who happens to be very successful in his trade. One of the reasons he wants out of the business is that he can't handle the violence. He maintains a stony grimace because he has to. If he doesn't, he will be killed. The few times circumstances seem to be out of his control, he does reveal a little emotion. This helps make his character all the more real, and helps to make the lack of emotion in the remainder of the film seem all the more necessary. If they show emotion, they could get robbed, killed, or worse.

The story is nothing new. We have all seen dozens of films in which a criminal wants to retire. Everyone makes it more difficult for him than he wants. Every character wants something from every other character. Again, nothing new. But ""Cake"" takes this to a new extreme. As they say, the Devils in the details. As we watch the story unfold, it becomes more and more complicated. Every character wants something from someone else, but they are also working other angles and cons, double-crossing the people double-crossing them while working angles on third or fourth parties, who are probably double-crossing yet other people. Some may need a scorecard to keep all of the machinations straight. I'm not even sure I followed everything. Because there is so much going on, I was never bored.

""Layer Cake"" is a stylish, interesting, involving film about people you would never want to meet on a street corner.",1116201600,13,3929,4.588319088319088
2332626,5,B0009X7BD2,"I saw the US Premiere of 'Layer Cake' on April 28, 2005 at the USA Film Festival in Dallas.  As an added treat, star Daniel Craig (who portrays the film's elusive, nameless protagonist) was there to give the film a brief (and I mean *brief*) introduction.  We had recently seen 'The Mother,' and we were blown away by Mr. Craig's acting abilities and taken in (like many others I'm sure) by those piercing blue eyes of his.  In 'Layer Cake,' Craig is as different as can be than the carpenter he played in 'The Mother.'  And, the buzz welling up around him right now as the next potential James Bond tells you everything you need to know about what the industry thinks of him: it's like betting on an undiscovered growth stock.

I've read 'Layer Cake,' and I think Matthew Vaughn (producer of Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock...') and writer J.J. Connolly have done a great job getting a dense, detail-laden story onto the screen.  You've always got to leave something on the floor to get the essence of a story across.  On the minus side, that means that some of the book's richer characterizations - Morty (George Harris) and Gene (the great Colm Meaney) - had to get thinned out.  In the case of Morty, thinned *way* out.  He's a complex, hair-trigger brooder in the book.  In the film, he's maybe got 50 words throughout.  And my wife reminded me of the book's wonderful passages about Gene, trooping around London with a backpack full of bricks to toughen himself up.  We know in the film that Gene's a tough nut, but it's presented to us in quick swatches.

On the plus side though, the book is filled with crosses, double-crosses and triple-crosses.  This serpentine path becomes a *lot* clearer on the screen frankly.  Especially the parts where the UK guys get tangled up with a Serbian crew.  The movie is smart to clarify focus on and clarify that part of the story line, which I thought was rather murky in the book.

And, personally, I was not pleased to see the the parts of Master Cody (Dexter Fletcher) and sidekick Tiptoes (Steve John Shepherd) trimmed down.  Again, I understand the need to get a nice compact 104-minute movie, but I thought that Connolly's single best-written scene in the novel was a meeting between Craig's character and Cody in an old English barbershop, with Cody getting a haircut, pedicure, and straight-razor shave all while going through a faux, jingoistic rant to his barber about immigration, crime and other red-meat issues while portraying his buddy (Craig's character) as an English-less South American transplant.  And that doesn't begin to do justice to Connolly's writing of this scene.

For those of you who have read the book though, you're in for a real shocker at the end of the film.  Vaughn and Connolly go for quite a different ending here, and it packs a very unexpected wallop.",1114732800,2,2845,4.707070707070707

2332699,1,B0009X7BD2,"Pure RUBBISH!!!  Over convoluted, disjointed plot points, too many warring factions of bad guys versus the other bad guys who are even 'badder'!
Tons of blood and head bashing and shooting bodies with exploding guts on widows, walls, floor, faces, clothing, etc. You know....much of the splatter stuff that never really happens in homicide shootings (I'm retired Homicide Det.).
Far too much over use of the ""F"" bombs. I've seen many other UK crime movies and sting movies, but this one takes the cake for the most stupid use of F bombs.  The frequent over-use of the ""F"" word makes actor Samuel L. Jackson sound like an altar boy in a religious movie! I mean, the actors never win over the viewer when they force themselves to say ""F_ck"" so many times that the impact or shock value of a scene is totally lost.
There is also way too much mumbling and thick Cockney slang along with and crude Liverpool or Manchester accents. I tried replaying several spoken sentences by actors during this tortuous movie and I still can't understand the words.  Two reasons for this: (1) microphone volume is too soft during many scenes, and;  (2) mic recording is too soft (or the actors are just too lazy to enunciate their dialogue better).
I can't even believe Daniel Craig plays the punching bag, fall guy in this extremely frivolous piece of drek!!  THE ONLY HIGH POINT IS THE VERY BRIEF 3 SCENES WHERE SIENNA MILLER IS ON CAMERA FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES TOTAL IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE!

2332751,5,B0009X7BD2,"This is a very well paced and well plotted snapshot of the interplay between various forces in the uk drug world, police, big business and various layers of the social and criminal strata. Daniel Craig plays the protagonist and nameless narrator. A great role for him that brings more dimensions than he's been allowed to have in the various Bond flicks.

The film will probably take several viewings to ""get"", not because the plot twists are so opaque but because the dialogue and the thick cockney dialect requires adjustment (and those who suggested subtitles are probably right). However the director also is a master at visuals and conveys the thrust economically but effectively. Great cast, too; Daniel Craig gets the top billing but the ensemble all is fabulous.

I'm on about my 10th viewing and still finding new things. This is definitely an underrated film that got little attention stateside and sniffs from the U.S. Critics. Bollocks to their lot.

2332786,4,B0009X7BD2,"Greeted on release as a cut above so many of the increasingly tedious deals gone bad, gangster and geezer titles already in circulation, Layer Cake has worn well. First-time director Matthew Vaughn has good source material and knows what he is doing, a relief given some of his producer's credits (anyone for Swept Away?). Many of the plot elements, nasty, unmerciful East Europeans, things going wrong in Amsterdam, drug dens in London, posh meets gritty,  are now wearily familiar. But Kenneth Granham and MIchael Gambon add a gravelly gravitas to the proceedings. Cranham's Jimmy Price gets the ball rolling at a country club retreat, lording it over his subordinates, twinkly but ruthless.  Gambon's Eddie Temple, part professor, part consummate thug,  is way more scary and in control than any of his rivals, Serbian killers included. It's a master-class, his first appearance moving the film up a gear. As the unnamed hero, a  pre-Bond Daniel Craig, recovers from an overworked voice-over at the beginning (""one day drugs will be legal"" bla, bla, bla) and switches from wry, cerebral businessman outsider to a more ruthless and desperate  operator. Of the usual suspects, Jamie Foreman is gobby and crass, but subtlety is not required. Tamer Hassan is on the fringes. Dexter Fletcher is a good fit, but Layer Cake is (mercifully?) low on banter and japes and scrapes. Despite star billing, Sienna Miller has a handful of lines, but fares better than Sally Hawkins, whose trigger-happy, foul-mouthed 'Slasher' is somewhat at odds with her Bronte and Austen pedigree, You would not want to cross Colm Meaney's Gene at any price. ""Ah....that's one of my favourite guns."" Locations are lavish. The soundtrack is a tad self-indulgent ('Gimme Shelter' again??). But seeing someone gravely bashed up to the strains of 'Ordinary World' by Duran Duran makes a change to slow-dancing to ""Save a Prayer.""",1426636800,,1899,5.132686084142395

It's a decent enough movie, but I had a very difficult time trying to remember who was who and what was going on half the time without having to rewind and take notes.  I guess if I was willing to watch it a few times and study it, I'd eventually get it.

The acting in Layer Cake is mostly excellent although there are a few quite over-the-top actors thrown into the mix who almost destroy the credibility of the characters they're supposed to be playing.  But those cases are mostly bit parts and don't really count for much in the overall scheme of things.  The greatest problem I had with Layer Cake is that it often stalls and lacks a certain momentum that keeps it moving at a pace I'd personally prefer.  The main protagonist played by Daniel Craig is obviously very smart and outwits all of the baddies he has to deal with, but ultimately loses in a big way (I won't give away too much detail here).

I can recommend Layer Cake, but not without a great deal of enthusiasm.  It's certainly very watchable if you don't mind watching a pretty clever chess match being played between all of the various bad guys and the Craig character",1409961600,,1185,4.378995433789954

I am sure this was the flick Bond producers watched when they picked Daniel Craig to become James Bond.  The one scene where he holds a gun for his first time and starts aiming around corners is ""Classic Bond"".

Stylishly acted and directed, Layer Cake has less-buff Craig in one of his most recent pre-Bond roles. With a dazzling cast of interesting characters beside him, Craig (as the unnamed drug lord) portrays both confidence and naivete in a solid performance.  Backed ably by the reliable Colm Meaney, and Michael Gambon and as the mentoring and menacing business partners, Layer Cake is a refreshing take on the ""mob stealing from mob"" story line.  My only significant complaint is a many of the central characters are one dimensional and somewhat cartoonish.

2333135,5,B0009X7BD2,"Though I was initially introduced to Daniel Craig in the apparently made for foreign TV two part but combined movie about Craigs portrayal as a reporter that happens to be in Moscow attending some conference that reporters attend......yawnn.....but it seems that Mr Craig had spent some time previously in Moscow learning the wretched trade of Journalism......anyway that movie centered around the fact that an unknown son of Josef Stalin had been raised in the middle of nowhere in Russia being groomed for a return when the supposedly predicted fall of Communism would come about........but that has nothing to do with this movie.
I really discovered that Craig was indeed a very talented actor when I viewed Layer Cake and despite its rather ""down"" ending, I enjoyed everything about the movie. It had a tremendous story line, great ""narration"" during parts of the film by the main actor, Mr. Craig........just a very, very entertaining movie.
When it was announced that Crag would be the next James Bond I initially had problems picturing the man in that role but as Casino Royale and now two subsequent films have proven, Daniel Craig can do just about anything that involves acting and do it extremely well.

2333149,4,B0009X7BD2,"I'd never heard of Daniel Craig pre-2004. Within a short space of time he starred in Enduring Love and this movie, and all of a sudden there was a new British leading man. But don't go thinking that he's a super-suave secret agent in Layer Cake. If anything XXXX is a bit of a helpless wimp when it comes to physicality.

The unusual marketing for Layer Cake, featuring a yellow Land Rover with an iron scalding the hood, is what drew me in initially. I was worried that it would be horribly flamboyant in the vein of Guy Richie. Thankfully director Matthew Vaughn wanted to develop his own style and the resulting movie is much more refined and laid-back.

XXXX is a coke dealer with low ambitions. He wants to make a neat fortune and escape into retirement. His boss Jimmy Price has fallen on hard times and manipulates XXXX into a compromising position between rival crime boss Eddie Temple, brash loudmouth wannabe gangster The Duke, and Serbian war criminal Slavo. If he is smart enough he just might be able to get out alive, get the money, and fool around with Sienna Miller.

At 106 minutes Layer Cake is sharply edited and crams in loads of plot, more so than many movies much longer in length. It passes in a breeze and features a great soundtrack and a score by Lisa Gerrard. Ben Davis' anamorphic photography (in the now-defunct JDC-Scope) makes it all look very slick while somehow never drawing attention to itself.

You can see how Craig got the Bond gig from his performance in this movie, but it is much more than a career stepping stone and seems to have been neglected by wider audiences in light of his more recent successes.

The Blu-ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with LPCM 5.1 sound and a small coupling of extras.",1408579200,,1737,4.55448717948718

2333332,5,B0009X7BD2,"Some people say that the British gangster genre is crowded; even if that's true, Layer Cake and the other greats stand head and shoulders above the rest. Daniel Craig brings intensity and smarts to this role as a successful drug dealer who's looking to get out while he's ahead. You can see where the seeds for his 007 come from, as he shows a cheeky side when he's afraid that sometimes gets him in trouble. The film is dense, with layers piled on top of layers. The narrative is (relatively) linear but the payoff is not. Things hinted at or explicitly shown (sometimes VERY explicitly) leave viewers wondering ""Why?"" but when the answers come it's GOOOOD. Have to respect director Matthew Vaughn for bringing such solid talent together in such a way that each performance serves the story and the characters. ""You can't be mad at someone for doing something when they had a good reason for doing it"" seems to be the film's lesson.",1407542400,,933,4.66060606060606

2333359,4,B0009X7BD2,"I thought I knew how this movie would go, following a tired old plot with the same old shoot em up and predictable ending - I was pleasantly surprised and found myself forgetting about the slow start as the action ramped up to seat of your pants action.  Not all the acting was top notch, but the dialog was correct for the 'time' and situations, totally believable.

Camera placement and 'switching' was managed well, not a back and forth close up series between actors leaving you feeling like it was a ping pong game.  Sound recording was just as good and the locations were chosen to fit the theme - WELL DONE!

We have a series of drug running organizations, all trying to make a living and move to the top of the pack - some are just your basic street thug mentality that will always be the bottom feeders, and then you have the ones who have moved up, figured it out, and pull in the profits off the actions of the replaceable underlings they hire.

Daniel Craig is one of the up and coming middle management types who is making plans to call it quits and live off his stashed away cash.  He gets caught up and played by three other top level organization heads, all trying to pull one over on the other.  Without giving to much away the movie moves in and out between the interactions of several people, some form alliances with each other, and the overall plot of a drug rip off gone bad and just about all of them trying to make it right to save their lives, yet somehow come out ahead.

Some do, some do not, graphically so.  There is no real up close killing scenes, the ones that are end up being a bit tame (IMHO) and the blood looks more like cherry juice or raspberry jam, rather weak special effects.

The plot overall is good, the sub-plots are timed well, and just when you  - and they - think they have it figured out and neatly wrapped up....

It's not nearly smart or well-written enough, even though writer-director Vaughn was a Ritchie collaborator. There are *way* too many layers -- that is, way too many characters, only a few of whom are interesting in any way, and way too many subplots, which are in fact stacked one on the other like layers of a cake. Trying to weave them all together for a slam-bang climax, the movie jumps the proverbial shark. Some good Brit character actors help keep it mildly entertaining for a while, but Craig is miscast in the lead and never gets a handle on his character. And special boos for Sienna Miller's part, one of the dumbest, sketchiest female characters in modern movies. She's only there to act slutty and dopey. It's just insulting. There are much better Tarantino-Ritchie imitations out there. Skip this one.",1404604800,2,949,5.012658227848101

The book was meant to challenge ideas about what is moral and right and how little we humans actually shape our own lives.  The movie version strives to be faithful to that goal but in doing so, relies on a lot of dialogue that a single or second or even third viewing can miss.  This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with British accents.  I can see why some viewers would not like this movie after one screening but I would urge them to watch it again.  The story it is trying to tell is a lot bigger than the story most viewers will experience the first time around.

2333545,3,B0009X7BD2,"This is a good drug/crime film starring Daniel Craig and a few lesser known actors. XXXX is about ready to take his windfall and quit the business altogether when he is propositioned by the head honcho to complete a few tasks before leaving. These including negotiating for a massive amount of pills and finding a missing person. He taps his several resources to accomplish both tasks, only to find out he's being played from all sides. What is a guy to do when his back is against the wall?

The movie itself is a good twist and turn keep you guessing until the end thriller along the lines of ocean 13. Just when you think you have everything figured out, all of the pieces shift.

I gave the movie three stars for 2 reasons. First, the dialogue sound was horrible. The movie volume was at a decent level, but I had to turn up my soundbar higher than I've had to for anything else. During transitions between dialogue and music, the difference was extremely clear as everything would be booming. It seemed like they didn't spend much on the recording aspect of the film. This caused me to miss much of the dialogue, and therefore critical elements of the movie. You would think sound would be movie basics 101.

The other problem I had with Layer cake was the ending. I won't go into details as not to spoil things, but leaving him on the ground was a pretty bad way to end things. The last scene was completely unnecessary, especially with the apology. Honestly, who does that!?",1391644800,,1481,4.518656716417911
2333546,4,B0009X7BD2,"I rather liked this 2004 British ganster film, even if it is not really a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of an Unnamed Man (Daniel Craig) who is a succesful drug dealer, working with two trusted associates, Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris). Having made enough money Unnamed Man plans to retire from the drug dealing business for good. His plans are however contradicted by his dangerous business partner and main cocaine supplier Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), who wants him to do something unusual - and saying ""no"" to Jimmy Price comes usually with such a high price that it is not really an option... In the same time, a unstable moronic gangster named Duke (Jamie Foreman) and his even more unstable and moronic girlfriend/partner in crime Slasher (Sally Hawkins) contact Price with an offer to sell one million ecstasy tablets - and the Unnamed Man is charged to deal with this thing too... I will say no more about the story.

This film was clearly influenced by the great success of earlier Guy Ritchie's films ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" and ""Snatch"", but it is somehow more serious, more realistic and darker, even if there is still some humour and some really over-the-top-and-out-there characters, like Duke, Slasher, Lucky the Hitman (Paul Orchard) and especially Dragan (Dragan Micanovic), The Horrible Incredible Invisible Invincible Serbian Hitman...))) There is of course a lot of double-crossing, triple-crossing and according to my calculations in one case there is even a tetra crossing...))) Language is strong, action pace is good, dead bodies drop at regular basis and of course there is an attractive gangster moll, a hot vixen named Tammy (Sienna Miller), adept of temptation by phone...

I usually don't like Daniel Craig very much (I refuse to consider his Bond films as being real Bond films and can't wait to see him replaced...) but in this film he does very well and the character he plays is well thought and well done. The accumulation of plots is similar to the technique used in Guy Ritchie's films and is well kept under control, with most of things being solved towards the end. I must however warn you, that the ending is a cliffhanger - and for my personal taste, when such thing doesn't lead to a second part, it is a rather a poor idea.

Bottom line, this is a very honest gangster film, not as funny or good as the two masterpieces cited above but still good enough that for his third gangster film, 2008 ""Rockn'rolla"", Guy Ritchie actually copied a lot from ""Layer cake""... I will keep my DVD for possible another viewing in the future. Enjoy!",1390262400,,2667,4.854945054945055
2333547,5,B0009X7BD2,"First, Sienna Miller in Agent Provocateur even for a few moments is worth the price of admission. The soundtrack is worth the price of admission. Mostly, this is a crime drama that never lets its guard down, and I appreciate that. Great characters, well-crafted fill out a cast headed by a pre-Bond Daniel Craig. Frankly this feels like his Bond audition tape at times, but is that a bad thing? If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out on great directing by Matthew Vaughn, who learned from Guy Ritchie, but clearly has a voice of his own.",1389657600,,548,4.6020408163265305
2333548,2,B0009X7BD2,"Layer Cake trades on Daniel Craig's talents and the rest of this cast, many of whom you'll recognize as character actors and from Guy Ritchie movies. The problem is the meandering plot, scenes about nothing, and the general lack of coherence. Ostensibly, Daniel Craig is a drug dealer who 1) Hates Guns, 2) Is trying to quit the business, 3) Knows what he's doing. Problem is, he gets enmeshed in a theft of pills from a psychotic Serbian drug lord. The connection that puts Craig's character in the hot seat is dubious at best: he asked to move the pills by his supplier of cocaine and then the Serbian quickly assumes Craig is responsible for stealing the pills resulting in Craig on the run, trying to get out, etc. All this runs around in circles with the usual drug-dealer killing, shooting, chasing, fighting, that would be more interesting if slimmed down and better told. Daniel Craig is a favorite actor of mine, but he got stuck in this piece with other very good actors for reasons that are beyond me. A couple of re-writes would have made this a decent film. Maybe if you're stuck on an airplane, it will keep you occupied for a few hours.",1389657600,,1151,4.565217391304348

The acting is not engaging. The dialogues are bland.

The action scenes do not look professional. They clearly reflected the limited budget of the film. After 38 minutes into the movie, the mastermind of the robbery was shown dead on the floor with blood on his t-shirt. It looked unconvincing. After 40 min, a guy committed suicide in front of many women in the bar. It was shown briefly and it did not stir up any emotion.

After 45 minutes, I did not find any suspense at all. It's the same feeling I got until the end.

I could watch this film over and over - it really is that good. British gangster/crime movies of the first decade of the 21st century seem to have been dominated by Guy Richie's manic, self-important creations. Layer Cake comes in under the radar as a more complex and thoughtful look at the seedier side of life, but (mostly) avoiding the crimes of pomposity or slapstick.

First off, it's gloriously shot with some classic camera work, intimate and expansive by turn and a crackling backing track (fave scene is the drive to the club to the tune of The Cult's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-Sells-Sanctuary/dp/B001MTZJG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She Sells Sanctuary</a>). Then the cast - a veritable who's-who of the (then) young turks and old guard of British acting. Craig strikes sparks off Michael Gambon (probably the best of the bunch here) and Kenneth Cranham, Jamie Foreman and Sally Hawkins add an element of unstable comedy value and George Harris and Colm Meany mix salt-of-the-earth chumminess with shocking savagery. Yes, some of these performances are a little OTT and the Richie heritage does show through; on the other hand, Craig plays his part just right as a nice-guy-baddie-with-no-name with a cheeky nod to his forthcoming Bond role. In fact, his performance in Layer Cake significantly tops anything he's done so far as 007.

The story is good value too; typical crime caper stuff, multi-layered, pacy, ambiguous and amusing - lots to watch and lots to keep up with. Maybe it founders in its predictability but I'm not going to score it down for that - it's more than made up for by the glorious mosaic of actors, their faultless performances and the rich visual experience.

Dialogue? There are some classic lines here - archetypal Britflic hard man stuff. Vinnie Jones must have been biting his pillow for not having been given a part of this one.

XXXX (on the phone): Dragan?
Dragan: Yes.
XXXX: I've got an idea... Why don't you come 'round for breakfast? I'll squeeze some orange juice and grind some coffee and we can talk about this like adults. How's that sound?

Dragan: No.
XXXX: Well, **** off then.

It does help to have the English subtitles on or you'll miss developments, what with the pace and thick accents of some characters, which add to the color.

2333783,5,B0009X7BD2,"Layer Cake is a black comedy that is a good deal more comedic than black.  Daniel Craig, not yet beefed up to play James Bond, is great as a mid-level drug dealer who is doing quite well and doing the smart thing:  investing most of his money with a reputable broker, recommended by his boss, Jimmy Price, played by Kenneth Cranham.  Craig's character is planning to use his investments to retire early, something he'll be announcing soon.  But first there are a few loose ends.

Jimmy Price's boss, occupying the very top layer of the multi-tiered ranks of big-city British drug dealing, wants his wayward daughter found and returned.  She's fallen victim to the same sneeze-inducing white powder that makes them all rich, and she's split from rehab with her junkie boyfriend.

Locating runaways is not Daniel Craig's thing, so he farms the job out to a couple of young friends, guys who spend a lot of their time very persuasively affecting a cultivated British accent because young American female tourists respond so much better to their affectations than to their natural working class patois.  The guys are slick, smooth, glib and funny, and more effective at tracking down missing junkies, especially dead ones, than I had expected.

Anyhow, by now you've got the plot, insofar as there is one:  Daniel Craig wants to retire early and the rest of the movie consists largely of obliquely connected events, each one just another obstacle in Craig's way, and each one more hilarious than the other.  Plot or no plot, this is Daniel Craig's best film, and the supporting cast is sensational.  Every time I see Sally Hawkins, no matter what sort of role she's playing, I think of her as Slasher, a foul-mouthed, histrionic, gun moll and girl friend to one of the more inept characters with whom Craig has reason to deal.

Colm Meany is also excellent.  In his funniest scene, he beats Daniel Craig to a pulp atop an open freezer filled with filleted fish, thinking Craig has betrayed him.  Hard to believe that 007 could get so badly battered by a middle-aged Irishman, who subsequently apologizes for his error.  But, as we've already noted, this was before Craig beefed up.

Craig's sidekick, Morte, played by George Harris, has an uproarious beating scene of his own, when he exacts revenge on a no-count jerk who's reckless over-indulgence cost Morte ten years in prison.  He almost kills the guy!

I know.  I know.  How can beating be funny?  But even if you don't like violence, you've just got to laugh.  Imagine the three stooges given the appearance and demeanor of 21st Century British sophisticates, but who are otherwise pretty much the same as always.  You'll even laugh when you see a self-assured hit man take a hit himself from a bullet fired right through the scope of his rifle and into his eye.  Hardly a sound.  It takes a second or two before we figure out what has happened.

Though advertised as an action-packed thriller, Layer Cake is really a vehicle for a series of loosely related, very violent, very funny, sometimes complicated scenes of the sort that Brits do so well.  (Think of Rock'n'Rolla.)  This is definitely not a film that takes itself too seriously, though the acting and comedic timing are as good as they get.  The ending will prompt just about everyone watching to do a double-take and exclaim with total surprise ""What the ... !!!

Layer Cake is definitely a keeper.  I've watched it a dozen times and still find it very entertaining.  And be alert for the tension-relieving joke about an Irishman who found another man with his wife ...",1321315200,,3583,4.773983739837399

After about thirty minutes with this, though, the truth of the matter became painfully clear: Vaughn needs Ritchie just as much as Ritchie needs Vaughn. It's an unpolished picture, all twist and no character - the polar opposite of Ritchie's latest caper flick, ""RocknRolla."" Layer Cake's heart is in the right place, with a setup so familiar it may as well have come straight from the same brainstorming sessions that produced the duo's earlier collaborations. But try as it might, this film just can't manage to grant its players the same kind of mettle that was so present in those preceding pictures. They're lifeless before running into a violent end, going through the motions but lacking the conviction to make their words feel authentic. And there are no less than three dozen of them, many of whom are on screen for less then ten minutes, playing major off-camera roles amidst all of the twisting and the turning.

2333797,4,B0009X7BD2,"Layer Cake (Matthew Vaughn, 2004)

When I heard Guy Ritchie had originally been slated to direct Layer Cake, I figured I knew what I was in for. I couldn't have been more wrong, and I was pleasantly surprised by that; this is a much straighter gangster picture than I was expecting, far more Get Carter than Gangster No. 1, and that worked much to its credit. Vaughn, Ritchie's longtime producer, has since gone on to direct Stardust and Kick-Ass, and in hindsight, how did he make a gangster movie this good, anyway?

Our unnamed protagonist, referred to in the credits as XXXX (Daniel Craig, who became the new James Bond a year after this movie was released), is a British cocaine dealer on the verge of retirement. (One of his rules: ""get good and get out."") Unfortunately, his boss, Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham, recently seen in Hot Fuzz), catches him with one foot out the door with a ""request"" for a job that's not usually up his alley: find Charlie (Nathalie Lunghi in, to date, her only big-screen appearance), the drug-addled daughter of Eddie (Longitude's Michael Gambon), a surface-respectable gangster much farther up the food chain. Worse off, Jimmy also wants him to broker a deal for two million pounds' worth of pharmaceutical-grade Ecstasy that's fallen into the hands of an incompetent fool who goes by the name of The Duke (Gangster No. 1's Jamie Foreman--who actually is the son of a gangster). All is going reasonably well, or as well as can be expected given that everything got knocked into a cocked hat the second Jimmy said ""do me a favor"", until a couple of complications get in the way. The first, as it always is, is a girl. Her name's Tammy (Factory Girl's Sienna Miller), and she's the girlfriend of Sidney (Bright Star's Ben Whishaw), a small-time dealer our hero questions while trying to discover the source of all this Ecstasy. The second is, in fact, that source; it seems the drugs were stolen from a Serbian drug lord named Dragan (RockNRolla's Dragan Micanovic), a guy notorious for stopping at nothing to redress grievances to his operation as messily as possible. There's a lot more to it, but we'd be getting into spoiler territory there.

It's kind of hard to believe that Daniel Craig, who's now a household name, was still on the rise as recently as 2004, but when Layer Cake was released, while British audiences were quite familiar with him from TV appearances (among them The Ice House, an adaptation of Minette Walters' classic first novel), Americans had caught him in Elizabeth, Road to Perdition, and if they were paying attention I Dreamed of Africa. (No one actually saw Tomb Raider.) It was just after Layer Cake that his career took off; in quick succession came Munich, Casino Royale, and The Invasion. (Your career taking off doesn't automatically mean all your films are great. Worse, The Invasion was followed up by The Golden Compass. If he hadn't already been James Bond....) Everyone knows how good an actor he is now, so telling you how good he is here will be kind of redundant. For that matter, this entire cast pretty much speaks for itself. I mean, come on, it's Michael Gambon in a gangster film, for pete's sake. You do the math. For some reason, I was put in mind more than once of Lina Wertmuller's stab at adapting Patricia Highsmith, Ripley's Game; take that as you will. As for me, I quite liked it. A straight-up gangster mystery with none of the expected silliness. *** ",1295395200,4,3442,4.741235392320534

I have only one (extraordinarily) small complaint.  The Blu-ray is a few years old.  Sadly, that means that if you buy it now (I write this on Dec. 26, 2010) you will find that the clear plastic of the case has warped and wrinkled from all its time sealed behind the shrink wrap the BD comes in.  It happens to all DVD and Blu-ray cases that remain shrink-wrapped too long.  As I said, a completely minor complaint, but it does somewhat detract from the aesthetic of the movie's case.

2333802,4,B0009X7BD2,"Daniel Craig, before James Bond fame, in a London-based crime story adapted by J.J. Connolly from his own novel of the same name. Unfortunately, Connolly allows complicated subplots to overwhelm the story and distract from the characters. Even superb acting by the entire cast, coupled with Michael Vaughn's excellent directing cannot overcome the cliches and contrived situations such as Craig's kidnapping or the film ending. This could have been a great movie and failure to achieve greatness is more noticeable than if it were just another run-of-the-mill crime story. However, it is enjoyable especially because the cast is great.

Daniel Craig plays Mr. X, an upper-echelon cocaine broker masquerading as an upscale real-estate agent in London's wealthy West End. Craig works for Jimmy Price (played by Kenneth Cranham), a manipulative, violent, backstabbing cocaine kingpin. Jimmy is a solid part of the plot foundation but this story is not about cocaine dealers. It is about losing control of your life due to circumstances far beyond control.

Unfortunately, the script at times gets lost in a complex web of complicated sub-plots about Serbian drug lords, assassins, African swindlers, low-life hustlers, heroin addicts, mercenaries, and upper crust British billionaires.

Director Michael Vaughn does a great job and the cinematography is excellent as is the acting, soundtrack, and production value. This is a guy film with violent action, profanity and just a few minor scenes with girls. Unfortunately, the cake has too many layers.",1286496000,,1547,5.4375

Here's a movie that I had to watch four times to basically understand what was going on. And I'm still not completely sure about all the details of the plot. Part of the problem was those thick British accents and all the local references which I was clueless about. Fortunately, I swallowed my pride and put on the English subtitles for my third and fourth viewings. Boy did that help! And the pithy Wikipedia plot summary also worked wonders!

Layer Cake is based on J.J. Connolly's talky novel and you could say that the film version is dialogue heavy. Sometimes that's a good thing (the dialogue is very clever) but at other times, scenes seem a bit too long and draggy.

We never learn the the name of the protagonist who's played by Daniel Craig (the character is referred to 'XXXX' in the credits--let's just call him 'Craig' for short). Craig reminds me very much of a modern-day Steve McQueen. He's a drug dealer who views himself as a businessman, not a thug. His supplier is the older gangster Jimmy Price who summons Craig to a ritzy club for lunch and demands that he find Charlotte, the drug addict daughter of Eddie Temple who's disappeared (Temple, another older gangster is far more sophisticated than the impulsive Jimmy). The search for the missing daughter is merely a sub-plot in the film; the main plot involves Jimmy ordering Craig to purchase a large amount of Ecstasy pills under the control of 'The Duke', a foul-mouthed psychopath who always has Slasher at his side, a nervous nilly of a girlfriend who always seems to be putting her foot in her mouth.

Director Matthew Vaughn (who produced Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock & Barrel') has made it a point that he wanted to make a 'serious' gangster picture and not copy Ritchie's style which often employs humor (mainly black comedy). Unfortunately, some of the characters in Layer Cake are unintentionally funny. Take for example Duke and Slasher fumbling for directions as they try to locate the Serbians' lair. And what about when Slasher loses control of her machine gun during the robbery and shoots one of the workers? Other instances of pure idiocy occur later in the film.

I had a hard time believing that Duke and his hapless crew could so easily rip off the nasty Serbs (how exactly do they catch the Serbs by surprise?). And why doesn't The Duke simply kill the Serbians--they are supposed to be ruthless, aren't they? The Duke ends up falsely bragging on the street that Craig is connected with him and before you know it, the Serbians are after him too! Craig and his crew want to slap The Duke around for his indiscretion, but when they arrive at the boatyard where Duke's middleman was working on moving the purloined merchandise, they find the man dead, obviously the victim of the Serb's enforcer, the dark assassin, Dragan.

I forgot to mention that Craig has already met Duke's gangster wannabe nephew and his sexy girlfriend, Tammy (Sienna Miller). The story begins to drag when Craig's hired associates find Charlotte's boyfriend, Kinky, dead up at the drug rehab facility (the scene could have been easily cut by a good ten minutes). And then there's Director Vaughn trying to imitate early Tarrantino when he has Craig's right hand man, Morty, stomp and scald low-life Freddie Hurst (Jimmy's right hand man, Gene, explains to Craig in a flashback that years ago, Freddie was responsible for Morty going to prison for ten years-- the bizarre tales involves a hoodlum committing suicide in a crowded restaurant, Morty being found with the body in the back of the van by the police after Freddie falls asleep as the getaway driver).

More unintentional comedy occurs after Gene gives Craig a gun. Craig can't help himself as he blurts out his tremendous disdain for the use of firearms and the next minute he's deftly wielding a weapon and has morphed into a professional assassin. Somehow the character transformation is supposed to be funny but I just didn't get it.  Sienna Miller has one short unconsummated sex scene with Craig who's suddenly kidnapped by Temple who plays him a recording proving that Jimmy is a police informer. More dumb criminals: Jimmy, it turns out, has been suckered into a bad investment by some African scam artists. In the most ludicrous scene in the entire movie, Craig somehow gains access to Jimmy's estate and murders him (how does he get past security?). Despite no longer having access to his laundered money (his accountant has flown the coop), Craig makes a deal with Eddie to sell him the stolen Ecstasy pills. Oh yes, more silly Tarrantino stuff: Jean beats Craig to a pulp for killing Jimmy but then forgives him after hearing the recording of Jimmy spilling the beans. Craig is as dumb as the rest when he convinces his Liverpool gang associates to lend him their hit man so they can ambush Dragan in a public park. Wouldn't you know it, but Dragan has been waiting for them all along and easily takes out the hit-man.

The Layer Cake climax seems rushed (and not very 'layered'). The police end up confiscating the pills during a raid and Dragan lets Craig off the hook once he brings him Duke's decapitated head in a cooler (the Serbs aren't upset since they're now manufacturing gobs of Ecstasy pills). How does Eddie end up with the loot? I think two of Craig's associates manage to pilfer some in an armed robbery of a Serb courier (?). As for Craig, the gang wants to make him the new boss but just as he walks out, he's cut down by Sidney, the Duke's nephew, who's jealous that Craig has taken his girl.

I'm afraid 'Layer Cake'has a few too many 'layers' for me. With its unnecessary subplots, gratuitous violence and convoluted plot that doesn't always make sense, I can't claim to be a big fan. On the other hand, I did enjoy trying to figure out what was going on. I guess that does count for something.",1283904000,,5889,4.714285714285714
2333805,3,B0009X7BD2,"Layer Cake is an adaption of J.J. Connolly's excellent crime novel about an unnamed young drug dealer/cutter (Daniel Craig) who's trying to save enough money to retire from his criminal life. This film adaptation written by the author and a directing debut for Mathew Vaughn is a credible but underwhelming effort.

While the plot of the film 'Layer Cake' follows more-or-less closely to the novel it never really feels like it goes anywhere. Everything you see in this movie you've seen in other gangster films, especially if you're a Guy Ritchie fan. That's not to say that it's bad or anything and director Vaughn uses some really colorful locales and has some great (and strange) use of music. Unfortunatly his camera work gets hung up on slow zooming and these close-ups of Daniel Craig's face which add nothing to the experience (at least not for me). The filmmakers might have intended for there to be some voice-over work in these close-ups but ultimatly any effect seems lost (though by the end I had a photographic memory of Daniel Craig's facial structure).

One thing I love about this film (and the novel) is how it uses dialogue to move the story forward as opposed to action. The dialogue is (usually) very snappy and the actors do a great job of bringing their colorful characters to life especially Daniel Craig, George Harris and Colm Meaney

Like I said, Layer Cake isn't a bad film at all it's just not a very memorable one. This WAS Mathew Vaughn's first film but he did a much better job with Stardust and Kick-Ass. If you're a crime film fan you might like this one but just don't expect anything you haven't seen before.",1282435200,,1644,4.701388888888889

2333808,4,B0009X7BD2,"I liked Layer Cake enough to watch it again a few years later, and the blu-ray is a very nice upgrade. It's a well-shot film with many interesting angles and colorful moments which benefit from the hi-def. Director Vaughn doesn't have Ritchie's genius for camera movement but for his first effort behind the lens LC is decent enough, and Craig is about as good as he gets here, which is quite good.

Craig is upstaged by many of the supporting cast, though, especially Meaney and Gambon. Meaney is becoming the new Michael Caine,  ubiquitous in most every Brit and Irish film of the last decade, but it's all to the good as he always delivers the goods, and LC is no exception. Gambon is also excellent as usual. The score by Lisa Gerrard is solid and she delivers some of her patented distant wails which work well here as they're never too in your face. Or ears.

The real hero of Layer Cake is JJ Connolly, writer of the screenplay and the novel it's based on. The movie has a perfect opening in a drugstore, which sums up our society's addiction to both drugs and pointless drug wars. If the whole film had stayed that tight this would be a modern classic, but it soon veers into semi-standard new Brit gangster film, though this is among the best of the bunch. The plot seems simple but we soon see how byzantine it all is, until the very end which is really a bit of a waste in some ways, though perhaps realistic, whatever that means in this context.

But I'd recommend Layer Cake in any case to all fans of sharp dialogue and interesting plot twists; if you liked The Usual Suspects and Lock Stock, this is their offspring and you're bound to like it too.",1278374400,,1663,4.42483660130719
2333809,5,B0009X7BD2,"Like Fight Club, you never learn the name of the primary character -- played by Daniel Craig -- whose perspective Layer Cake portrays. (That is the ONLY thing it has in common with Fight Club, rest assured.)

Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch grabbed a lot of attention as neo British gangster flicks, breathing new life into an old genre. And they do deserve the hype, imo.

But Guy Ritchie's gangster films (except Revolver) have hearty senses of humour about themselves, as well as lots of gun wielding. Layer Cake and Sexy Beast (with an absolutely terrifying Ben Kingsley -- yes! -- as a psychotic head thug gangster) take themselves much more seriously, and therefore the violence that occurs is more viscerally affecting and less amusing and cartoonish.

As a result, you're a bit more invested in the characters of Layer Cake, and the payoff is therefore different and somewhat more satisfying. This isn't to say Layer Cake is humor-less -- it isn't. But the humor is more subtle than the Guy Ritchie flicks; it doesn't smack you in the face so much as nudge you and wink knowingly. It's less slapstick and more satirical and cynical.

Layer Cake has multiple intertwined stories because of the conflicting desires, motivations, and orders of the characters in the ensemble cast. The characters consist of higher up criminals who the Narrator (Craig, formally known as ""XXXX"" in the credits) sells drugs for, the Narrator himself, some corrupt law enforcement, and some amateur gangsters who want to jump into the big time. He's not at the bottom layer of the cake, but he's definitely got layers above him.

However, the basic premise is one we've seen before: career criminal plans to pull major job and then retire happily ever after. But, thanks to the greed and machinations of rivals, superiors, and law enforcement, and a special side job he's supposed to take care of, nothing goes as planned. Thus the completion of his plans and his life, let alone his happily-ever-after retirement, are in jeopardy.

The way that the plot manages to pull the rug out from under you with twists is not as important as the execution. The cinematography is gorgeous, the camera work is streamlined; not a shot is wasted, and almost everything shown is important to the plot later on.

I love the kind of film where you have to PAY ATTENTION to truly get what's going on, and this is Layer Cake. If you try to surf the net or do other things while having this on in the background, you probably won't be impressed. But if you actually sit down to WATCH it, without distractions, you'll find plot points and criss-crosses galore to keep you guessing.

Such a film doesn't have to perfectly resolve itself -- look at Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep, with Bogart and Bacall -- but it's amazingly cool that it captivates your attention WITHOUT massive violence, explosions, and gunfire. I need this more now than ever before.

Maybe it's just me, but I've developed a sort of ""blockbuster movie fatigue"" caused by a steady diet of 90s-00s American blockbuster big budget films. They're always trying to top the one that came before with more/bigger special effects/CGI, tightly choreographed interpersonal violence/hand-to-hand combat, and some kind of large-scale mass destruction of big material objects or buildings, preferably employing major firepower and screeching metal.

Eddie Izzard jokes in ""Dress To Kill"" that the Brits are known for ""the smaller films"" like ""A Room With A View of a Staircase and a Pond"", but his comparison of British and American films is particularly apt (and if you've never seen it, Google for it on Youtube; it's hilarious, as is Eddie).

But I LIKE the fact that Layer Cake is tightly focused on what happens to a small, loyal crew of guys; I LIKE that the fate of the world or industrialized civilization doesn't ""hang in the balance"" -- like it unrealistically does in so many of those big, dumb, exciting blockbuster flicks. I LIKE that what Layer Cake has to say about the world, society and -- yes -- class can be told via the microcosm of the small(ish) world of the characters in the film.

And I like the fact that the career criminal played by Craig is entirely non-thug-like; when he has to resort to gun violence, it's nowhere near as blase as it is in American movies (which is probably at least one reason why, come to think of it, I suffer from blockbuster fatigue). It gives Layer Cake a definite non-American perspective.

(You *should* be upset by having to wield a gun or people around you doing so. Part of what's wrong here is that gun usage upsets no one and it's no big deal  -- and consequently tons more people are killed by guns in the US, even when you adjust for population, than in other first-world nations. I know; I work in an inner city ER, where far too many kids under 20 come in with gunshot wounds. Every day in Chicago, once the weather gets warm, multiple people are getting shot, some fatally. Which is why we are the murder capital of the US off and on, as we were in the 90s, vying with NY, LA and Detroit for top honors of most homicides. Sigh. Ok, off soapbox now.)

Anyway, the (surprising?) humanity of the protagonist makes movies like Layer Cake and its characters so much more realistic than any blockbuster, despite all their stylized cool.

And cool it is. The ensemble cast is great. Craig's character's two right hand men are played by Colm Meaney (ST: TNG and ST: DS9, as well as many other UK and US productions), and George Harris (you've seen him if you watch BBC programs on PBS or BBC America; he's been in lots of stuff). One of the amateurs is played by Burn Gorman (Bleak House, Torchwood). The plotting is pretty tight, including flashbacks you think are pointless, but are NOT.

All in all, well worth your money for rental or purchase. If you like Lock, Stock and Snatch, you will probably like this. If you like Sexy Beast, you will almost certainly like Layer Cake.

And while I'm at it, I'll recommend In Bruges as well, although it's almost an anti-gangster gangster flick in setting and execution, at least 2/3-3/4 of the way through the film... but is still wildly entertaining.

There's more bathos in Guy Ritchie's flicks, and more pathos in Layer Cake, Sexy Beast, and (especially) In Bruges. But this is a genre I like -- neo-British gangster flicks -- and Layer Cake is an especially great specimen.

Note: if you are not a native of the United Kingdom, you may need to watch Layer Cake multiple times to get all the dialog... or else put the subtitles on (I did both). It stands up to repeat viewing, definitely.",1276473600,,6645,4.70223752151463

It follows an honorable crook, which we know only as XXXX (Daniel Craig), who specializes in trafficking cocaine.  XXXX's strategy is to never get involved directly with the criminal element, surrounding himself with other honorable criminals who in turn conduct themselves professionally.  It's all a very neat arrangement on the surface, and XXXX thinks he's got the system beat.  He plans to retire and disappear from the business. WARNING: As we eat this cake, there's bound to be some juicy spoilers inside.

Peel back a layer... and it turns out that XXXX actually has a boss, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Craham).  He demands XXXX personally track down Charlie, the daughter of Price's fellow crime boss Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon, an evil version of Dumbeldore!).  This violates XXXX's rule of never getting personally involved, but he has no choice.

Peel back a layer...and Price also wants XXXX to organize the distribution of ""super ecstasy"" tablets from The Duke (Jamie Foreman). Except that the drugs were actually stolen from a Serbian gang, who is intent on tracking them down and murdering everyone involved.

It seems Price doesn't like the idea that XXXX thinks he can retire and wants him dead - if Temple's men don't kill him, drug dealers certainly will.

But the so called Mr. Big, Jimmie Price (Kenneth Cranham), has some additional work for our pristine college boy that most assuredly leads him into unsavory territories where he must get his hands dirty (and bloody).

He oozes charisma and style in this movie.  From start to finish this movie keeps you engaged, mostly because of how well Craig does taking us through his characters roller coaster ride.  It's funny how you are rooting for a drug dealer to win....that's how great the writing and acting is in this movie.

Even though the source material has some fun in it, similar to the two previously mentioned films, the life is stripped out of Layer Cake in this crime world quasi-drama where 3 story lines (well... 3 *main* story lines) intersect at one person whose life gets turned upside down in an instant.

But all the story lines lay flat.  There are no characters that you really care about enough to stay with.  They feel almost too polished because they are supposed to be uber-cool drug dealers.  But that also makes them very forgetable.  There is no character development that makes them jump off the page.  This makes the movie dull.

It is not a total loss though.  There are cool concepts.  Guilt of murder, retribution, and endless double crossing are just a few.  None are taken to full developement, but are good points to ponder what could have been.  There are nice cinematic shots, which is also interesting.  And there are a few points (including the ending) that I think were pleasant departures from the norm.  These factors make it 'not boring.'

In feel, it actually reminded me of 'Lucky Number Slevin.'  Not in story line (although the crime bosses and double cross components are there), but rather in overall style.  That movie is better than Layer Cake.  I would recommend that movie before this one.  If you are a Daniel Craig fan, I would get this on sale somewhere.

Next, I loved how this movie does not glamorize the drug trade. Yeah, there's a fortune to be made but you pay for it and if you aren't smart you die and usually in a really painful, nasty way.

Craig's character, Mr. X is cool, oh so smart and sick of the life he's living. He wants out and only has to do his boss a ""favor"" in order to be able to retire. It seems so simple, so clear cut but Mr. X discovers that is not the case. Two scenes stayed with me long after I watched the movie. First, when X has to kill a man and his reaction to that. Watching Craig try to get some sleep, try to drug and drink his memory away was fascinating. The second memory scorcher is the very last scene which I won't describe. I'll only note that it's amazing how much emotion Craig can register with just his eyes.

The movie made me feel like small because I was always looking from under a table or behind a napkin on the floor and even through the cigigrates smokes (maybe that's why they all die in the end; remember, smoking hurts you!!)  Even when they sit in nice club with girls there was no cake.  I think this movie is tricky that way, because you think cake, party, and nice talkings, you have no talkings, just sad music and people who are mad and hurt.

2333839,2,B0009X7BD2,"""Layer Cake"" begins with a long, long voiceover - always a red flag for a movie of any genre.  When the movie begins by telling you about itself, rather than showing exposition through dialogue and action, you're in for trouble.  And the intro is classic cliche: an honorable criminal who wants to retire gets into one last gig that goes horribly wrong.

But even cliches can be the basis for a good movie if done right.  Sadly, they are not done right here.  In ""Layer Cake,"" the actors cannot be faulted; they do a great job with the material.  The cinematography is interesting and very good.  But the direction sucks the energy and life out of the material, and the material is a muddled, overcomplicated script that leaves you scratching your head about critical plot points.

""Layer Cake"" is a pale imitation of better US and UK movies, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" being the better example of the genre that springs immediately to mind.  This movie is watchable, but just barely.  This is a desperation call at 11 pm on Friday night at the video store.

2333843,5,B0009X7BD2,"Good showcase for Daniel Craig, but those of you who come to LAYER CAKE hoping to see something of Sienna Miller, beware, she's in it for about 5 minutes despite her prominent placement on the DVD case.  However she's nearly naked so that might be worth it for Miller fans.  First she appears in a club, acting wild, clumping up and down on the dancefloor while Daniel Craig and his buddies look on.  She's more Edie Sedgwick in this than she was as Edie Sedgwick, and introduced to Craig, she leans over him and slips her phone number into his breast pocket.  Hugging her naif boyfriend, she mouths ""Call me"" to Craig, silently, but you could read her lips from fifty miles away.  She's not much of a dancer, is she, but who cares.

The plot of LAYER CAKE is extremely convoluted and I expect that few people who watch it will be able to catch all of it.  Even J J Connolly, who wrote the novel the movie's based on, and the screenplay, has said that a few of Matthew Vaughan's directorial tricks have left him befuddled and he forgot who did what to whom by the end of the movie.  I think he also forgot to give Sienna Miller much of a part.  Next time she runs into the film it's to have sex with Daniel Craig, which she begins with great abandon by pushing him down onto a set of satin sheets, then wriggling off of him to run into the bathroom and dress herself even more provocatively, with silk stockings and garter belt, than when she came in.  It doesn't take her long, but by the time she gets back into the bedroom Daniel Craig's been kidnapped and stuffed into a laundry cart by two goons masquerading as Room Service.  The look on her face is priceless as she surveys the mussed up bed and the empty room, disappointed in love again.  ""She's quite a ball of fire, isn't she?"" my wife commented, with that tone of voice I always decipher as either deep fascination or absolute repulsion.

""I'm not sure what you want me to say,"" I countered.  Finally Sienna Miller returns for her final scene which I won't spoil except by hinting that she begins the scene elated and ""up,"" and ends it with a cry, thus proving she's capable as well as an eternal tabloid grabber.  The rest of the picture is a good showcase for Daniel Craig, a sort of Scarface meets Memento.",1179446400,2,2271,4.3610451306413305
2333844,5,B0009X7BD2,"Don't you love films where the hero is in fact an anti-hero with no name or backstory? Right, nor do I. But this import from the land of pies and porkies is a sparkling romp through the seedy shenanigans of the drug mafia. I see several viewers likening it to Guy Ritchie's black-humor capers, but I suspect that's chiefly attributable to the theme (underworld) and the accents (the many colors of London).

Layer Cake thumps about on its business from the get-go and fritters no time on any buffoonery. Empires clash against rival empires, men are no superstars and bleed when their nose gets punched in, and the scuzzy cat and mouse game leaves little room for escape; only moments of courage, grit, and luck. Luck, most of all.

A pre-Bond Daniel Craig glitters as the glib man-with-the-plan, a rapid social climber in his industry forced to learn the cruel lesson that drug dealing cannot be quite the methodical, low-profile business that he has always wanted it to be. That treachery and even murder are occupational hazards of his world, and yuppie overconfidence its principal sin.

The script is punchy. Non-fat. Memorable lines. The music is pitch-perfect, and lends beautifully to the tension. Expect to have densely exciting layers created and then unraveled as you go along, not knowing exactly what will happen next. Right until the very denouement, which some may find contentious but one that I think installs just the kind of moral hook that seemed to have been missing from the entire film. I've always believed that the ending can make or mar a film, and this one here is a classic.

A fine production, as foxy as they come. What Lord of War was to gun running, this is to the dreary world of drug dealing. Highly recommended purchase. This one will stand to repeat viewings.

2333847,4,B0009X7BD2,"I first noticed Daniel Craig in the first Tomb Raider flick. I thought he was good looking, loved his voice, but didn't really feel anything like the ""it"" that Angelina Jolie puts out (in contrast to Gerard Butler, who held his own very well with Angelina in the second TR flick).

But in this one, Daniel Craig OWNS the screen. It's very hard to look at anyone else when he's there. And it's his magnetism and the constant plot twists that make this film highly watchable. It's stylishly directed, and the casting is really faboo--Michael Gambon, with a very strange fakey tan look, is, as usual, a blast to listen to and watch. His homely face acts up a storm. Daniel Craig, with a sort of semi-wrecked handsomeness--look at those deep-set, small, haunted eyes, those grooves and creases that contrast with that smooth blond hair, that constant natural pout that makes it seem as if he's always plotting something or regretting something. The supporting cast do their jobs, too--Colm Meaney, Sienna Miller, Tom Hardy, etc.

This is not a cheerful world, this world of drug dealers with their secrets, their machinations, their grudges, their vengefulness, their greed, their odd loyalties and betrayals. And it's not supposed to be cheerful--even if sometimes the predicaments our protagonist gets into seem nearly comical in their complexity and jolts.

So, Daniel Craig plays the dealer ready to leave his criminal world, retire, and take a hot blond chick with him to post-criminal happyland. Unfortunately, fate is against his plan. His boss orders him to do this last job, you see, and this last job is anything but simple. (I won't go into the plot much, since other posts here do that in great detail, down to the last twist, nearly. Help yourself to any spoilers here you wish. I'll skip spoiling the twists, okay?) Every time Mr. X turns around, something gets in his way--and the bodies start piling up. And he's doing everything he can to get out of the tangle and end up alive--and with blondie--and find a life out of the layer cake that is the hierarchy of the criminal world.

I thought the ending was perfect, given everything that's come before.

BTW, watching this AFTER Casino Royale makes it very clear why Craig was a viable candidate for the Bond job. Look at the way he handles Gene's (Colm) gun, very Bondish. Look at how he walks--the confidence--when he's suited up. Look at the way his eyes can grow deadly cold, and always have this ghost haunting them. Perfect for the new, more serious, less gimmicky Bond.

I grew up with Sean Connery as the definitive Bond. No one displaced him, even the charming and handsome Mr. Brosnan. After Casino Royale, Craig is my favorite Bond. And in THIS film, LAYER CAKE, the elements that made him a fabulous, driven, lithe, fast, menacing, love-smitten James Bond are all in evidence.

Daniel Craig is on my list of fave actors now, after Casino Royale and Layer Cake. He's got ""it"", and both films reflect it. So, the main reason to watch this plot-twisty film is Mr. Craig.

Plans within plans within plans. That best describes LAYER CAKE, director Matthew Vaughn's (SNATCH) crime-drama about a man with no name who's need to get out of the drug running business leads him to a surprising end.

Daniel Craig (CASINO ROYALE) stars as XXXX (he has no official name but one can surmise that it may have to do with a Faustish character). He wants out of his illegal drug profession but is swept back into play by a large market intro of ecstasy by a wacked-out guy named the Duke (Jamie Foreman). XXXX's boss orders him to meet with the Duke and to find out what happened to a friend's daughter who'd disappeared with her boyfriend.

Come to find out, XXXX's boss is out to pull a fast one on this supposed friend with the missing daughter by kidnaping her himself (should XXXX find her) and forcing a showdown that'll allow his boss sole access to the street-bound ecstasy.

But an additional layer of deceit quickly gets piled on as we learn that the Duke stole the ecstasy from a very nasty character called Dragan. Dragan is not to be messed with, killing anyone or anything that gets in his way. We never see Dragan but only hear his ominous voice or the back of his head.

Another layer is added as XXXX learns that his boss is actually a police informant and Craig's character is forced to kill him in order to survive -- something that wreaks havoc on XXXX's sleep and psyche ...for a while.

XXXX's friends Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris) act as grounding forces that keep XXXX in line, until he kills their boss and Gene is forced to thrash him in order to get the truth from him.

The final layer involves a sort of femme fatale named Tammy (Sienna Miller, CASANOVA) whom XXXX becomes infatuated with and will unknowingly bring about his downfall in the most ironic of circumstances (not having to do with drugs or money at all).

An entertaining if overly drawn-out layering of plots that sometimes feel forced or contrived and other times hitting their mark, Layer Cake is an interesting look at Daniel Craig just prior to his rise to the 007 ranks.

Personally, I prefer director Vaughn's aforementioned Snatch and his now cultish LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS to this flick. It's engaging enough to be interesting, but not much more.",1175212800,6,2313,4.6495098039215685

He hopes to retire from the business, but not if his associates (including Colm Meaney, George Harris, and Tom Hardy) have anything to say about it.  As a producer of Guy Ritchie's breakthrough British mob films, director Matthew Vaughn doesn't feature the same kind of ultra-kinetic energy, but it is nicely paced and features some laugh out loud moments with scenes of bloody violence.  Craig is superb as the desperate middle-man who's in way too over his head, while Michael Gambon is even better as the top man who has his hands in everything.  Though there are a few brief moments of incoherency, the twisting screenplay and just plain awesome soundtrack all help make Layer Cake a spectacular modern crime-noir with a British flavor.

Add to that the fact his boss doesn't want him getting out of the business and will take any steps to see that doesn't happen and you begin to see the dilemna. Of course there are a couple friends that help him out, but there is always the question of who you can trust, and a lesson to learn about how ladies can cause you problems you don't expect.

It's a British gangter film filled with numerous plot twists, humor, and a good deal of violence.  Just for good measure, first time director Matthew Vaughn throws in a bit of sex appeal by adding Sienna Miller to the cast.

If you found this movie, chances are you were looking for something like ""Snatch,"" or you were looking for a movie featuring the new James Bond, Daniel Craig.  You get plenty of time to examine Craig in this movie--using a gun, flirting with ladies, acting cool, and doing other Bond like things, but this is not a Bond movie.  It contains sex, drugs, and violence--and to a certain extent it glamorizes all three, so if that's not your cup of tea you probably shouldn't spend your time on this one.

On the other hand, if you like quirky, funny action movies that stand apart from the mainstream, then this one might interest you.  It's not always perfect, but it certainly has enough to make it worth while.",1163462400,,1040,4.6502732240437155
2333882,4,B0009X7BD2,"The trend of UK gangster films keeps going on with `Layer Cake.' Matthew Vaughn, producer of successful `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and `Snatch,' debuts in the movie world as director with `Layer Cake' very stylish thriller about an unnamed cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig) who finds himself trapped in a tight spot without his knowing. `Layer Cake' is about this protagonist (only referred to as XXXX) and other gangsters (mostly with unique personalities), and after all, is about who can eat his cake and have it.

The film starts with Daniel Craig's character confidently talking to us about the rules of the business, and showing how he manages his jobs as a professional dealer carefully and methodically. During this introductory part you see the underworld where XXXX lives as he sees it, how the business is carried out, and some of his trusted partners or his immediate superior Gene (Colm Meaney).

When he thinks everything is fine, he is ordered by his boss to find a missing girl. Then things start to go wrong: his partner suddenly beats someone in a diner; a Serb mobster threatens him to give what he doesn't have; and a mysterious gentleman appears before him, telling him something he should have known long before.

[LAYER ONE TOO MANY] The film successfully keeps us guessing with tightly edited sequences, but perhaps its surprises are more effective with one less twist in the second half. The photography is all stylish, and the actors did fine jobs, especially Daniel Craig who manages to give depth to his unnamed character, and Michael Gambon who steals every scene with the chilling menace hidden behind his quiet attitudes.

Unlike Guy Ritchie films, you cannot say `Layer Cake' is a trend-setting film, not because this British noir is inferior to others, but simply because it arrived several years too late. But `Layer Cake' is a clever and well-acted thriller that would never gets you bored.",1162684800,3,1932,4.953703703703703

Daniel Craig plays a seasoned cocaine dealer (known only as XXXX) who's recently had visions of ""retiring"" from the job, but who finds it's a lot harder getting out of the ""business"" than it ever was getting in - but then it always is when you've sold your soul to the devil, as Craig's character clearly has.

With its plethora of characters and profusion of subplots, the script (by J.J. Connolly, derived from his own novel), presents a challenging labyrinth for the audience to make its way through.  And even though we do find ourselves a bit confused over the minor details at times, the main storyline remains largely in focus, thanks primarily to Craig, who makes this latter-day Faust such a charismatic and compelling figure, and to Matthew Vaughn, the director, who keeps the action percolating along at an exciting clip.

I just didn't enjoy the movie that much. Craig was ok but nothing great and Sienna Miller? Come on. I mean she was on the cover and on the back of the box and her part amounted to that of a potted plant. Of course they did have her in a ligerie scene that went no where but for her to even be on the box for as small as her role was was ridiculous. The other characters were ok but there were just too many and because there were too many they were all pretty much under developed and hard to follow.

Rather than Ritchie fireworks that are good for quickly establishing a character in a short, visual moment, the characters here are treated much more seriously and thus feel more complex than bombastic, but the weakness here is in the resolution: while Ritchie pulled off moves that were suprising and explosive, Layer Cake is merely suprising, and not in as satisfying a way.

""LC"" invites inevitable comparisons to Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino.""  In all three movies, a man who has become successful in the criminal underworld through merit tells you how its done.  These ""criminal procedurals"" are fascinating, and ""LC"" holds its own with Scorcese's wonderful movies.

The protagonist in ""LC"" is XXXX, played by Daniel Craig, whose cold blue eyes may be the only objects in the movie harder than his ripped physique.  He has reached that eerie point in his criminal life -- he has been successful enough to afford to walk away from the criminal life, but paradoxically, that success makes him too valuable for the upper-echelon criminals to let walk away from ""the life.""

XXXX gets caught up in a complex web of deceit, kidnapping, drug dealing, murder, revenge, betrayal, friendship, and despair . . . not necessarily in that order.  As the story drives from one crisis to another, XXXX's world of leathery, hard men and one gorgeous woman alternately comes together and falls apart as he strives to stay in front of forces conspiring to kill him.  At the end of the day, XXXX learns the lesson Humphrey Bogart learned in ""Casablanca,"" that the cares and woes of one human being don't amount to much in the world.

But that doesn't mean that XXXX won't fight for it with everything he's got.  And that fight makes ""LC"" compelling.

Be warned -- the characters of ""LC"" speak with a dizzying range of accents, and this is one of those movies that even though the dialogue is in English, there are several scenes where subtitles would have helped.  These scenes make the movie more authentic, to be sure, but you may not want to watch the movie with the guy or gal who is always complaining, ""what did he say?""",1147305600,4,1927,4.7507507507507505

Craig's boss wants him to broker a deal involving one million pills of a super form of Ecstasy.  He also commands him to locate the drug addled daughter of his colleague Eddie Temple played by Michael Gambon.

Complicating matters is the fact that the Ecstasy was pilfered from a murderous group of Serbians who mistakenly believe that Craig and his crew were complicit in the theft.  He now must evade their murderous reprisals.  Craig also discovers that Temple is actually his boss' boss and there is no love loss between the men.

""The Layer Cake"" is perhaps the most complete movie I have seen in a long while, with elements inter-linking all through to provide a varied and wild concoction of violence, humour and thrill.

The unnamed main character, (Daniel Craig), narrates the movie of his dealings in the underworld's drug scene, dispensing his wisdom all the while, including his ""golden rules"" for dealing drugs. XXXX gets involved with a deal regarding some pills, and also gets pulled into a favour for a criminal leader further up the food chain. The plot twists and turns, and there is an array of very colourful characters, with equally colourful dialogue.

As noted by another reviewer, the musical score just blends effortlessly with the movie, making scenes more poignant and lending itself well to the overall feel of the movie itself.

The humour, though not a major feature, is there in its subtle way. A good example is the sex scene that almost was, until XXXX got nabbed by some very serious looking and large fellows. Irony abounds all through the movie, though humour is definitely not the mainstay of the plot.

The ending, (I won't spoil it), is excellent, and makes the preceding movie seem all the more powerful, especially in regard to XXXX's narrations. It was a complete surprise to me, and it was perfect.

Great acting done by all (it got Craig the role of JAMES FRIGGIN' BOND after all), Layer Cake is a fun, awesome, exciting British gangster film.

You can't argue that the screenwriter didn't follow the author's intent either since J J Connolly wrote the screenplay.

2333924,4,B0009X7BD2,"The key to a good movie: A balance between style and depth. Matthew Vaughn's ""Layer Cake"" keeps that balance like two fat kids sitting on opposite sides of a teeter-totter.

Other than exceptional British acting, there's one reoccurring theme in Vaughn's different movies (""Snatch"", ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""). He takes the dirty things in the world and stylizes them, but keeps them realistic. In ""Snatch"" it was violence and underworld crime. In ""Lock, Stock"" it was gambling, stealing, and selling. In ""Layer Cake"", it's cocaine.

Case in point: Daniel Craig plays Mr. X, an unnamed cocaine dealer yearning for a quiet retirement from his business. He's a master, he's brilliant-in his own words, his business is easy as long as you don't take the piss and stick to a few basic rules.

The exposition in ""Layer Cake"" is as straightforward as any film: introduce the main character, his game, and his enemy. The upset comes next-Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), a powerful drug lord, asks Mr. X to find the missing daughter of another powerful friend, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon, Professor Dumbledore in ""Goblet of Fire""). Reluctantly taking the offer, Mr. X is dragged back down into the bowels of the cocaine underworld and quickly finds his wishes of an easy retirement drowned in more murder and drug-dealing.

From here, ""Layer Cake"" runs parallel to ""Scarface"" in several ways other than cocaine. Mr. X is smarter than his cohorts. He's got the tools in the form of thugs and several back-up connections. He knows how to use them without too much hassle. X isn't as outspoken as Tony Montana but he's just as cunning, with an honest income and real-life connections. His character development takes him from a faceless dealer to a larger-than-life mastermind. By the end of the film, I was shaking my head thinking, ""This guy is brilliant.""

What isn't so routine and smooth is the story development. Vaughn doesn't hold your hand and point out the important characters. I often wondered who this guy or that girl was and why they were part of the current situation. The story is so deep that it took two or three views before I really understood the plot. Where ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock"" had multiple, interlocked characters that come together in an end-all finale, ""Layer Cake"" branches off in so many directions that loose ends are difficult to tie up. Without ruining anything, the ending itself is very abrupt. It left me wanting another film, another scene, another possibility. If anything, despite the confusion, it shows that ""Layer Cake"" has a charm and a hook that snagged me.

""Layer Cake"" also lacks the obvious humor of Vaughn's other British capers, and instead uses realistic wit to break up the tensity. Mr. X points out early on that dealing cocaine and getting busted comes in two flavors: 15 years in prison or $28K in fines, which is more time than a rapist. The way that some of the lines are delivered (which points to the fantastic acting) made me double-take-am I supposed to take it literally or am I supposed to laugh?

One of the most impressive things about ""Layer Cake"" is also evident in Vaughn's other films. The camera shots and overlapping scenes give off a feeling of life outside of what is currently going on. While Mr. X is doing something in one spot, someone else is making his life a living hell in another place. The music is also noteworthy, and it has a similar effect to ""Snatch"" in that it tells as much about the scene as some of the shots.

All in all, this is no ""Snatch"". It didn't make me laugh nearly as much and I'm not ranting and raving about how it's the best movie in years, but I'm sitting here floored by brilliant acting and a coolness factor so high that it's only the confusing story bringing it down.

And when he doesn't it's for the same reason.

The cast is great.  Daniel Craig is fantastic - he'll make a very fine, albeit quite different 007.  George Harris and Colm Meaney are very good as XXXX's business partners, Morty and Gene.  Gambon is especially fine, playing a character quite different from his most popular role, Albus Dumbledore.

Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's hits ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."", makes an astounding directorial debut.  There's some amazing stuff in here.  To me, the most amazing scene of the film involves a murder inside a cafe.  It was so unusually filmed and edited, it just blew me away.

The screenplay, by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is absorbing, occasionally funny, and very well-written.  There's also an excellent soundtrack, including songs from The Cult and The Rolling Stones and a great score by Ilan Eshkeri & Lisa Gerrard.

""Layer Cake"" blew me away.  It's certainly one of my favorite films.  By all means, see it.  It's a flawless, impressive, and damn cool crime drama that ranks among the very best.",1133654400,4,1726,4.705685618729097
2333928,5,B0009X7BD2,"Plot Summary:Mr. X, a successful drug dealer with a plan to retire, is suddenly thrust into a drug score gone seriously wrong by a man who plays him as a pawn.  Though it takes the better part of the movie for Mr. X to set himself on rails, he quickly asserts that he is no pawn to be played by three kings.  The story involves hidden deals, shifting alliances, baggage and a game where the stakes quickly escalate.  This is a wonderfully well-done crime movie.

It's hard to find much fault with this movie.  I didn't catch all the twists in the plot so I'm sure this is a movie that will reward one and maybe two more vieiwings.  The script is pretty good.  It's an intelligent script, written for a viewer of crime dramas.  The script doesn't spell out why certain events are happening; you have to piece together some of the connections.  It doesn't totally tune you out.  You do see some causal relationships between events and characters but the movie expects you to do some of the work.

The acting and character development are solid.  Daniel Craig plays this role exceptionally well.  His character moves through three phases that are marked by changes in the way Craig carries Mr. X, most notably through his facial expressions.  In the opening section of the movie, we see Mr. X with calm, cool assurance.  He does not screw people over in his deals.  He is above board, he pays proper homage, he treats the men under him right.  Then the fun begins and Daniel Craig shifts his character from a man of cool composure to a man whose face reflects suppressed surprised, a bit of indignation (as if, how is it I cannot retire?!) and a fair amount of ""What the heck is going on?""  The final phase of Craig's character is when he accepts the forces arrayed against him and he responds.

The pace of the script is casual even though the events playing out are far from casual.  I think the pacing of the script is intended to convey the sense of calm composure X has within him.  Though X gets rattled during phase 2 of his character's evolution, he nevertheless comes off polished without being one of those absurd action figures who are hypertalented and who somehow manage to avoid the laws of physics.  X is calm because he's going to make the deal happen.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Sienna Miller in this movie.  You may know her as the stunning British blonde jilted by that cad, Jude Law.  She played an excellent romantic interest in <u>Keen Eddie</u>, a well-done cop show that I loved, yet it didn't last beyond a season.

The script doesn't show any of the behind the scenes manipulations Mr. X contrives to orchestrate the close of the deal.  All it shows is a piecing together of what he set in motion.

This is a visually stunning movie.  It's filmed with a cinematic clarity and crispness that I totally love.  I do not like graininess, washed out colors or sloppy, boring shots.  Layer Cake's cinematography and production are superb.  The sets are well done, with colors that convey various hues at different points in the soundtrack, but overall the colors of the set give the film a kind of steely warmth; just enough cool edge to motivate but warm enough to help you believe that X has what it takes to rise above the bar in a game with rapidly escalating stakes.

There is one shot where X goes back to marshal up forces, including his accountant.  When he walks into the accountant's office, it is totally bare.  The shot of X's realization that his accountant has flipped on him is stunning: X crumples into a corner where creme carpet meets yellow walls and dark red leather square accents and dark wall paper.  The shot is wide and it conveys the scope of emptiness at this point: he is truly on his own and he has to make this work right.

The camera work is excellent throughout the movie and the editing ties the shots together well. Ben Davis and Jon Harris, directors of photography for this film, did a class piece of work with this film.  Their sense of composition, coloring and action is spot on.  Nothing ever seemed out of place in the frame.  The weakest shots are of the parking lot where one team of bad guys is holed up but that's because it's a gravel lot surrounded by chain link fence and dusty cars.  Every other shot is solid.

Layer Cake's soundtrack is another element of strength.  At three points in the movie (maybe four -- it might have happened once before I realized it was a part of the storytelling technique), the music comes up quite loudly.  The musical choices are great: edgy, driving, masculing yet also classic. Maybe a kind of upper middle class kind of feel to the groove.  The loud music signals a transition point in the movie.  It's a cool technique and though the music is loud, it isn't distracting and the technnique isn't cutesy.

Layer Cake is a great crime movie.  It's a British piece, so expect a different take on how the plat roles out.  Appreciate that the movie lets you do some thinking on your own, absorb the stunning cinematics and enjoy the story as it is told.",1132185600,11,5058,4.511551155115511
2333929,4,B0009X7BD2,"Can he be Bond? The book Bond was a cold bastard. He can be also,as evidenced by this quick and lean thriller. Very good. Loved the look of it.",1131840000,2,143,3.9655172413793105
2333930,5,B0009X7BD2,"Boasting a whole litany of reasons for its R rating, Layer Cake delivers a hard-nosed, well-paced, intricate plot revolving around drugs, murder, and the games hoods of the three-piece-suit variety like to play.  I must emphasize the word intricate - not being a natural devotee of gangster films, I had a little trouble keeping up with some of the twists - there's a pretty large number of heavies involved here, and some of the guys' thick accents didn't make things any easier for me.  Basically, I just sat back and took everything as it came - even if it meant running into D just when I had figured out the connections between A, B, and C.  I'm not saying the movie doesn't make sense, though, because it does - it's just more complicated than your typical mindless thriller.  It is a nice change, however, to watch a movie that actually encourages the act of thinking on the part of the viewer.

I'll get in trouble if I try to describe too much of the plot.  You've got this nameless dude (Daniel Craig), who's sort of upper middle class in the whole fancy gangster regime, who has no choice but to finally get his hands dirty on what he intends to be his last job.  First, he's got to find the girl of one of his boss's associates, and second, he's got to arrange for the sale of a cool million pops of Ecstasy.  Unfortunately, those drugs are in the hands of a big-mouthed flunkie calling himself the Duke, and he stole them from some tough Serbian joes who just aren't going to take that kind of thing lying down.  Things just don't go according to plan from the start, especially when our unnamed protagonist's own associates are liable to go off half-cocked at any given moment, but the whole mess is made even more complicated when another slimy fatcat joins the fun.  All of these people are connected, some going way back, but I would need several diagrams and about a half hour to explain all that.  All you need to know is that our anti-hero finds himself in a real bind, stuck between the drugs he can't get his hands on and one of Europe's most dangerous hitmen - and with friends like this fellow has, he really doesn't need any enemies.

It's the ultimate game of survival for our protagonist, as he'll have to outwit, outplay, and outlast all of the other players in the game.  You have to sort of like the guy, just because everyone else is slimier than he is.  There's a girl in the mix, too, of course, but it's violence rather than nudity that wins this film its R rating.  All of these guys play for keeps, and it's inevitable that the weak and stupid get offed.  I would have liked to have seen more blood (as head shots really should be messier than they are here), but I certainly can't complain about the level of violence on display in Layer Cake.  The whole thing is a cool, sleek production with a darn good soundtrack (including the obligatory Gimme Shelter), a challenging storyline, and impressive performances by all concerned (with Michael Gambon, as you might expect, standing head and shoulders above the rest).  There's even a surprise or two thrown in just for kicks.",1131753600,3,3111,4.515151515151516
2333931,4,B0009X7BD2,"Traditional gangster film with a modern British spin. Drug kingpin advances to the top of the trafficking 'layer cake' of drug smuggling, and believes he will be able to retire in multi-millionaire comfort. There's just one more job to do. While all the familiar gangster themes are here; heads packed in ice, double crosses, pistol wielding maniacs, the film boasts a realism that reveals the upper income underworld with little pretension, and not a godfather in sight. The entire organization is nearly brought down by the hot potato 'big score', - one million hits of the club drug Ecstasy, a loot, I would assume, no self respecting murderous drug smuggler would be left holding in a bust. It all makes for an intriguing and entertaining gangster film; these characters could be the grandsons of 'Goodfellas'. It's no wonder the cool, controlled Daniel Craig, as the accomplished and independent anti-hero, has just signed to be the new James Bond.",1130889600,,953,5.037974683544304
2333932,5,B0009X7BD2,"I'm not a Guy Ritchie fan. I thought ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" was cute, but not compelling, and I thought ""Snatch"" was more of the same. So I wasn't expecting much from ""Layer Cake,"" which I knew wasn't even a Guy Ritchie flick but a flick directed by the PRODUCER of ""Lock, Stock, etc."" and ""Snatch."" Things didn't look promising. However, I read a review by Roger Ebert that compared ""Layer Cake"" to ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" and mentioned that unlike Ritchie's other films, this one took itself seriously. I decided to give it a try.

I was blown away. ""Layer Cake"" is lean, mean, tough, and, ultimately, tragic. It is a gangster film in the tradition of ""The Long Good Friday,"" and if it doesn't have the epic scope that elevated ""Casino"" above other entries in the genre it's got echoes of that Scorcese masterpiece and a lot of good stuff of its own vintage.

Like ""Casino,"" ""Layer Cake"" tells the story of a man who is very, very good at being a criminal, but makes the mistake of believing that he can stop being one. Both DeNiro's Sam Rothstein and Daniel Craig's unnamed drug dealer want to go straight, but quickly find that they've gotten in too deep, that people depend on them, and that those people will not just let them walk away. Craig's drug dealer is a smart, but self-centered man who believes he's better than the guys he works for and the guys who work for him. By the end of the film, he's learned his lesson.

Craig's slimy, serpentine performance is very convincing and effective. It's hard to see how anybody watched this film and saw the next James Bond, but that's beside the point. He's surrounded by similarly talented performers in the always dependable Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon. Sienna Miller, who plays his love interest, radiates so much warmth and sensuality that it's not difficult to believe that Craig's dealer would be distracted by her, even when it becomes clear that next week is not promised for him.

The film also looks great. Though it was shot on the cheap, you wouldn't know it for a second, as the compositions in every scene are superb and everything has a cold, barren, metallic feel to it that perfectly suits the tone of the movie. This isn't the London you've got in your minds' eye-- this is a place without history, without culture, without values. It's a bleak, soulless world. There's nothing comfortable about it.

What impressed me most about ""Layer Cake,"" however, was not the tragic arc of the story, nor the performances, or the cinematography. It was the fact that the film didn't make mistakes, anywhere. There were no unnecessary scenes, no comic relief that didn't emerge organically out of the material, no attempts to placate the audience or make them feel better about what they were watching. The soundtrack doesn't provide easy emotional cues but picks its spots and nails them, then fades back and lets us draw our own conclusions about what we see. The romantic subplot that develops doesn't seem like an attempt to engage those put off by the rough stuff-- it's a vital part of the story, even if we don't realize it at first. The violence is profuse, but relatively bloodless-- it's cold, and businesslike, not passionate. Just like the characters engaged in it.

Finally, there are scenes that are so good, they inspire a kind of awe. I'm thinking first of a scene in which a character says precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time and violence erupts in such a controlled way that you'd think it was premeditated. Then, there's the scene with Craig and Miller in the hotel room, which is sexy without being exploitive and ends in a very unexpected way. Lastly, there's the final scene-- both the set-up, with Craig walking away from his table of friends, thinking hard, and the payoff, when the inevitable takes place just when we're thinking the movie's let its protagonist too easily off the hook.

Three great scenes. No bad scenes. No mistakes. No messiness. ""Layer Cake"" is an excellent film.

Rated R: Contains a remarkably limited amount of graphic violence, but a lot of people get shot; there are also some brief glimpses of sexual activity, lots of drug talk (and some, but not much, use), and language throughout",1130025600,5,4225,4.723202170963365

2333934,4,B0009X7BD2,"The DVD case for Layer Cake chose to use a review which said ""Hilarious!"" in big, bold letters, probably trying to  convince people that this film was similar to Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  This couldn't be farther from the truth, though, because this movie never tries to be funny.  Instead of a tongue-in-cheek British crime comedy, this movie tries to show a realistic view of the various forms of underground crime in London.  The characters are gritty and human, the dialogue is snappy, and instead of random violence right and left with no consequences to show for it, every shooting, knifing and other killing in this film has a profound effect on the characters, who actually show remorse, nervousness and other honest emotions.

Layer Cake will definitely appeal to fans of the aforementioned films, but don't expect a zany comedy.  Instead, enjoy this smart, gritty and realistic crime drama with its powerful acting and realistic storyline.",1129420800,2,972,5.04375

Colm Meaney has to be one of my favorite Irish actors.  Every role he plays he seems to enjoy so much.  His role in Star Trek: Next Generation allowed him to come into his own as an actor.  The fact that he's still called on to play roles in great movies like Layer Cake is testament to his acting ability.  Also, people just like to see him do his thing on-screen.  You never know what to expect from him, but you darn sure know it's going to be something unexpected.

Layer Cake should've been released in theaters in the US.  It had that big-screen presence to it that exceeds many films that make it but aren't worthy.  Funny how the movie business works.

More urbane than ""Lock Stock,"" way smarter than ""Snatch,"" it's a nicely assured debut by Matthew Vaughn and I think improved from the original novel by JJ Connelly (who penned the script).  XXXX's rougher edges were sanded off for the film and his IQ upped a few points.  Some might think that strains the credibility of the character, but personally I think that makes him all the more intriguing and real.  I am curious though as to how the film will age given that it feels so very specific to the here and now- not just the style of dress or the cars, bars, and slang, but how it captures a particular mindset in the mid 2000's.  A more sophisticated version of the 80's ""greed is good"" corporate frame of mind.

Another thing to consider in this film, is that it is very complex at times, living up to its name.  I found myself having to rewind back a couple of times to get exactly what happened.

2333941,4,B0009X7BD2,"""Layer Cake"" is the first film directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced  1998's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and 2000's ""Snatch"". Like those films, ""Layer Cake"" takes place in Great Britain's criminal underworld, so Vaughn is very much in his element. It is based on the novel by J.J. Connelly, who also wrote the screenplay. The novel is known for its accurate exposition of the drug-dealing underworld, and a rough cut of the film was criticized for having too much of that and not enough plot. The final cut of the film doesn't have those problems, but it is long and languorous at times due to exposition and simple lingering on some scenes. The film's protagonist and sometimes-narrator is nameless throughout the film, an idiosyncrasy that the audience may or may not notice, but which struck me right away, since I was taking notes and couldn't catch his name. The protagonist is listed as ""XXXX"" in the film's credits and press kit, so that's what I'll call him.

The story concerns a successful cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig), who is scrupulously careful in how he does business and whom he does it with. ""I'm not a gangster. I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine,"" he says. He keeps a low profile, keeps the clients happy, keeps his supplier happy, only deals with a small coterie of associates, and doesn't get caught. But he believes in quitting while he's ahead. Before he can, his supplier Jimmy Price (Kenneth Granham) asks him to find a buyer for a large shipment of Ecstasy pills and to do favor: retrieve the errant daughter of prominent businessman Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). It sounds simple, and our nameless purveyor of contraband reluctantly accepts. But it turns out that the guy who wants to sell the ecstasy, the Duke (Jamie Foreman), stole the pills from a Serbian drug lord in Amsterdam. The Serbian has sent his ferociously violent henchman Dragan (Dragan Micanovic) after the pills. Eddie Temple doesn't want his daughter found and is a man of grander agendas. And our man finds himself caught in the middle, immersed in a world of violence and inscrutable scheming that has gotten completely out of control.

One of the most interesting aspects of ""Layer Cake"" is the opening sequence, which introduces us to the concept of illicit drugs as an opportunity to make big money while they remain illegal, a status which our protagonist believes cannot last. ""So until Prohibition ends, make hay while the sun shines.""  That's what the people on every level of the ""layer cake"" do. We also get occasional glimpses of the early days of the modern drug business in Great Britain, since some of the characters have been in it since the 1960s. Director Matthew Vaughn creates a sense of evolution of the illicit drug trade, whose modern incarnation started among hippies in the 1960s and may end in big business of the 21st century. The anonymous cocaine dealer XXXX is somewhere in the middle, a savvy businessman exploiting Prohibition to his own ends and loathe to contend with the lowlifes who still permeate the business. Daniel Craig does a good job of this character who comes out of nowhere and has limited ties to anything. He's put-upon, trapped, and we never really know if he is clever enough to cope with his situation or not. ""Layer Cake"" is a clever, modern gangster film that's a little too long, but at least the unnecessary shots are visually interesting.

The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 2 featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate endings, story boards, posters, and an audio commentary. There are 14 deleted scenes and 2 alternative endings with optional director commentary. If you thought the ending in the movie was questionable, as I did, you might prefer one of these. ""Storyboard Comparisons"" (3  minutes) for 2 scenes show storyboards as we watch film of the finished scene for comparison.

2333942,4,B0009X7BD2,"When I heard Matthew Vaughn was making X-Men 3, I thought who the hell is he and that it will suck. When I saw that he only made a movie called Layer Cake, I thought ""a guy that made a movie about cake is making an X-Men movie ??"" lol. When I complained to people they said see Layer Cake and you'll see why he was chosen to to do X-Men 3. Now that I saw the movie I really wish he didn't drop out of doing X-3. Now that he is out and Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) is in, it might really suck lol.

  Anyway Danial Craig (The Road to Perdition) plays a cocaine dealer who wants out but is in for one more deal. It goes horribly wrong though and people start getting killed. He even finds that he has to hold a gun for the first time in his life. Him looking for a gun that suits him is one of the best scenes. He says to his friend ""you know I hate guns...., although that one is rather pretty"". I love that line. He also finds himself being targetted by a man who calls himself Dragon. He holds him responsible for the bad deal.

  The movie can be a bit hard to follow at times but Danial Craig is excellent and makes it worth watching. He makes you care about a drug dealer and want to follow him to see what will become of him. The direction by Vaughn is stylish and fun as well. So both Craig and Vaughn are real finds and have great futures ahead of them. There's also strong supporting work from Colm Meaney, George Harris and Michael Gambon.

2333943,4,B0009X7BD2,"Perception of life is usually in the eye of the beholder, and in Layer Cake it is in the eye of Daniel Craig's unnamed character who the film refers to as XXXX in the end credits.  Through XXXX's vision the audience will learn the hard lesson of commerce in the British underworld where on can be on the top one-day, and on the bottom the next.  The title itself plays metaphorically with the different levels of societal classes, and how one strives to reach the top.  Director Matthew Vaughn, who produced Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000), makes his directorial debut with a stylish crime story that follows the footsteps of his friend and director Guy Ritchie.  Yet, it feels more like a British treatment of Goodfellas (1990) that provides an amusingly sharp portrayal of how drugs can complicate the British underworld and society.

A detailed opening accompanied by XXXX's voice-over delivers a historical and personal perspective on how drugs have changed the socioeconomic tendencies of the underworld.  Vaughn also makes it visually clear through clever mise-en-scene and astonishing photography how boundaries between the law and lawless might eventually diffuse itself, due to the enormous sums of profit collected by the illegal drug industry.  In addition, XXXX's clarifies the customers demand for drugs in the eloquently statement, ""Give people what they want: good times today, stupid tomorrow.""  In essence, XXXX captures society's lack of patience and the customers' addictions in the minute statement.  Thus, XXXX claims that he is a professional and discreet businessman providing this need for those who are needy while accumulating sufficient wealth to retire.

Crime does pay, or at least that is the idea, that audience will receive in the opening of Layer Cake, as XXXX shows his plans of retirement.  However, retirement will have to wait when Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), a powerful gangster, requests his help.  It is a task out of the ordinary for XXXX who realizes that he has no choice and must push up his retirement date.  At the same time, a wannabe gangster named the Duke has acquired an obscene amount of ecstasy pills from an unknown location, which XXXX tries to acquire for Jimmy.  If this would not be enough, XXXX falls in love with a stunning blond that any fool would consider a sign of trouble.  This and much more begin to blend into an intriguing concoction that never will be predictable, or boring.

Layer Cake might have similarities with other gangster films; however, Vaughn generates a refreshing story of gangsters in the British society where the connecting factor between classes is drugs.  Much of the success in the film rests within Daniel Craig's sophisticated character that possess several fascinating traits.  In addition, his frequent and small voice-overs that illustrate his thoughts deliver an additional attention-grabbing aspect to the story.  Layer Cake pretty much focuses on XXXX, and his perspective on life and his status.  There are several excellent actors such as Colm Meaney, George Harris, Kenneth Cranham, and Michael Gambon that helps contrast XXXX's persona, which also augments the audience's fascination with the film.  All of the cinematic facets are linked under Vaugn's terrific debut, as a director that delivers a phenomenal action thriller that will keep the audience smiling until the end.",1125360000,3,3410,5.163636363636364
2333944,4,B0009X7BD2,"""Layer Cake"" is of that increasingly popular film genre that goes by the loose title of British gangsterism.  ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" comes to mind although this film is more a black comedy than ""Layer Cake"" which strives to remain true to its roots.

The essence of the film is that the lead character, XXXX, played by Daniel Craig is trying to retire from the drug trade.  He's had enough, is now comfortably well off and has played the game carefully and by the rules, to the extent that rules exist.  However, his retirement is postponed as he is drawn into an ever more complex web of intrigue and double crossing.  He finds himself being exposed to greater risk that he would normally accept.  He is forced to operate outside his comfort zone.

The film is well placed and totally entrancing as the viewer is gradually sucked in to this nether world of crime.  His cohorts seem quite believable as do the lords of the game and the shadowy Bosnian mafia that lurks as a background threat.  The plotting is complex and the deals always tense with big stakes being played.  The film has ""street cred"".

The film's ending is unexpected.  I will say no more as I don't want to spoil it for others.  Perhaps the best advise is simply to see it!",1125187200,68,1258,4.513274336283186
2333945,5,B0009X7BD2,"This movie is nicely paced, and well acted.  The soundtrack is very well done and complements the action in the movie very well.  Daniel Craig, as the unamed hero (xxxx), brings us a believable character who is in over his head, mostly due to circumstances out of his control.  The supporting cast is also well chosen, from Colm Meaney as the experienced right hand man, to Michael Gambon as the ""puppetmaster"" pulling everyones' strings.  Even though her role fits the movie as it needs to, as a dude, I think many would agree that more Sienna Miller would be a good thing.  Anyhow, if you liked previous British gangster offerings then you'l love this one.  And if you're new the genre, then I highly suggest this movie.",1125100800,,722,4.645669291338582
2333946,5,B0009X7BD2,"At last, a new movie that has wit, intelligence, suspense and style.  While Hollywood fumbles around adapting C grade TV shows to the big screen, the Brits bring us something made for intelligent adults.",1125014400,,203,4.970588235294118
2333947,5,B0009X7BD2,"This movie keeps you entertainned from the beginning to the end. As the main character gets himself into more trouble by the minute, you can't help but wonder how he can get out of all the trouble his drug business put him into. But with this kind of business, can he?",1125014400,,268,4.2745098039215685
2333948,5,B0009X7BD2,"At the beginning of ""L4yer Cake"" a mid-level English criminal who traffics in cocaine explains the world in which he lives, which sets up his goal of getting out while he is still alive and unincarcerated. If there is anything we know from such films, it is that getting away is difficult, not just because of the inherent nature of the business or because others do thing to keep bringing you back in, but also because in such stories the pivotal moment that means success or failure for such efforts is either lurking in the shadows or rears its ugly head at the absolute wrong time. So as soon as the main character talks about his desire to walk away from this life and the credits start rolling, we know full well this is not a good sign.

The character played by Daniel Craig (we never learn his name: he is identified in the credits as XXXX, apparently so we do not confuse him with a Vin Diesel character) is clearly competent as his chosen profession. He is not stupid and he is not greedy, two things definitely in his favor. The problem is that he is called to a meeting with Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), the next fellow up on the food chain. An ecstasy deal has turned into a complete disaster and Jimmy tells our hero (or should I just say protagonist?) to figure out what happened and fix it. As if that is not enough reason to start banging his head against the wall, he is also told to find out what happened to the daughter of Jimmy's boss, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). She is missing, and the reasons for it cannot be good. Plus you get the feeling that Temple is the sort who shoots the messenger, but not until he makes them suffer horribly. Ironically, keeping his nose clean (so to speak), means others are finding reasons to rub it in messes not of his own making. This means things are going to get worse, with no promise of them ever becoming better. Being smart might not be enough to get out of this one alive.

""L4yer Cake"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who was involved in producing Guy Ritchie's films ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoing Barrles"" and ""Snatch."" Apparently he was taking notes. But as a first time director Vaughn was helped by the fact that author J.J. Connolly adapted his own novel, which makes sense since he knows the labyrinth of the narrative better than anyone else. There was a point when I was wondering how the film's main character got involved with the rest of these crooks, because they are mostly thugs, the sort who blow somebody away and then keep the incriminating gun because it is their favorite. XXXX is too good for this world and every time somebody notices that he is smart it never really seems to be a compliment because the observation always comes from a character who could be thinking that this guy is smart enough to get things done and make money, but the more likely interpretation that showing you are intelligent is liking pulling up your shirt to reveal an Uzi tucked in your pants. You cannot be too smart in this world, because that can be just as fatal as being too dumb. The only different is who gets you the cops get the dumb ones, while the smart ones are going to get taken down by their own. We are rooting for XXXX, but we are not going to put any money down on his chances.

We have a hard time figuring out what is really happening because XXXX is having just a hard time figuring things out, and his life is on the line. People do not believe him when he is telling the truth so he knows full well that when he tries to tell people the truth being believed is not a likely outcome. You have to stay ahead of the game and our hero is missing what must be entire chapters from the rule book. The bits and pieces he picks up are helping a bit, but he has to have the whole thing figure out before the final piece is put into place. Early on I gleaned onto the idea that it was really what XXXX did not know that was the potentially fatal flaw in accomplishing his assigned tasks, so when it was revealed I was waiting for it. The key thing with ""L4yer Cake,"" assuming that you like this genre in the first place, is that the revelation is a fitting capstone to the roller coaster ride we are on.

Although the tone and the characters are nothing like it, the movie that ""L4yer Cake"" reminded me of was not ""The Usual Suspects"" or anything obvious like that, but rather ""The Sting."" It probably has to do with Gambon reminding me of Robert Shaw, because the comparison is by no means a spoiler; this is not even close to being a sting sort of film except in terms of narrative complexity. Fortunately, the acting is up to the writing for this film that is smart, but too smart, if you know what I mean. Remember this film and keep an eye out for what Craig, Vaughn, and Connolly do in the future, because this 2004 film could be the start of bigger things for any or all of them.",1124928000,,4867,4.327491785323111
2333949,5,B0009X7BD2,"I must say I love Snatch and Lock Stock they are two of my favorite movies so I was really looking forward to this even though Guy didn't write or direct it I knew that it would be good with Matthew Vaughn at the helm.  This movie was just a joy to watch great characters and good intertwining of stories but I didn't think it was all that complicated a lot seem to say that, I just don't know what the big stump was I am curios.  Anyway I love the London, British Gangster films and this one is right up there with Lock Stock and Snatch albeit a little less funny but that's fine it was Matthews own vision not Guy's so I liked that about it too.  Still Looking forward to Revolver though by Ritchie can't wait.",1124841600,2,712,4.107913669064748
2333955,5,B0009X7BD2,"I saw this movie before reading these reviews and thought to myself, ""damn, glad I saw the movie first or they would have ruined it for me."" I won't go into the plot but just know it's a 5 star movie for the type of movie it is.  If you go in looking for Snatch or LSATSBs, I won't say you'll be disappointed but it'll take you about 30 or so minutes to realize it's a lot more serious and less playful.  It definitely has a more sleek, higher class feel than either of the two Guy Ritchie movies and there's a funny bit about that in the Q & A session (part of the extras) with Craig and Vaughn where Vaughn talks about how it's nice to have real actors that know what they're doing vs the thugs in Snatch & LSATSBs and it shows.  It's a nice 2.40:1 anamorphic picture that helps add to the high class feel of it as well.  All this on a 4 million pound budget which no matter what exchange rate you use is dirt cheap!  American production companies should learn from them! You'll want to watch it a few times so it's definitely worth the $$!",1124841600,,1042,4.088235294117647
2333956,4,B0009X7BD2,"LAYER CAKE is a film to be watched with all of your senses alert: it is best viewed after a caffeine jag, or way before bedtime as it demands full attention to follow this circuitous and at times meandering plot.  You have to work at this one but in the end the work pays off - sort of.

To begin with the main character (Daniel Craig) is a nameless 'good criminal' middleman working quietly producing Ecstasy pills.  His motto is work small, stay quiet, pay your people on time, and get out when you can.  The remainder of the story is how our nameless 'hero' becomes insidiously involved in the various layers of his chosen crime of drug trafficking and the results of his blood-streaked rise to the top layer of the cake.  There are so many characters involved in this story (each well acted, tidy cameos) that soon you lose track of who's who and who just got whacked.  It is a violent climb to the top and a surprise ending that in retrospect should have seemed apparent.

Daniel Craig plays his heart out with this character and he is joined by such luminaries as Michael Gambon and Colm Meany in pulling off a pulsating crime drama.  Yes, it is in the same realm as 'The Usual Suspects' and other British wham bang high-density flicks.  The goods are delivered - but the question arises as to who cares?  Perfect for this genre, but keep the coffee brewing lest you let your attention lag.  Grady Harp, August 05",1124841600,3,1419,4.461240310077519
2333957,5,B0009X7BD2,"It's crazy that I even got to see this film: on a recent flight to London, the version of ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" that they were supposed to show was broken, so they announced that they were going to substitute ""Layer Cake."" I decided to watch it because I'm a big fan of almost everything involving James Bond, and I'd heard Daniel Craig was going to inherit the role. What followed astounded me so much that I watched again on that plane ride and three times more on the return trip.

The story moves at breakneck speed, with the darkly charismatic lead character trying to fulfill one last request from his employer before getting out of the drug business for good. ""When you have a plan, stick to it,"" he says, but as one of his associates proves traitorous, a batch of X he's planning to buy turns out to be stolen from men wanted for war crimes, and many people around him meet unappealing ends (including a murder attempt involving the remains of the victim's breakfast), it seems increasingly unlikely that he'll live to see his plan through.

With a jolting, ironic ending, an unusually good soundtrack, and the perfect mix of fascinating story and tense action, this became my favorite movie in a matter of days. If you are planning to buy a film for anyone with a shred of taste, get this one.",1124496000,3,1304,4.54468085106383

Just when you think you've got it figured out, it twists yet again. The fast-paced action keeps you interested and the music is awesome (I'll be getting the soundtrack next).

2333959,5,B0009X7BD2,"Saw this little known film in theaters a while back and my initial reaction was ""woah, this is awesome"". Think Tarentino with a serious feeling, mixed with thick UK accents and a lot of sharp plot twists and you are there.

The nameless protagonist is quickly in over his head after a slew of business deals go bad. His exctasy supplier stole from some serbs (just like in ""24"" the serbs are ruthless) and a big wig named jimmy is trying to skrew him over. Naturally our hero is caught in the middle and he's just trying to retire.

The movie confused me at certain points in the beginning because of the many introductions to characters and the intricate sideplots, but in the end it comes together quite nicely. Also, some of the accents were so thick you couldn't understand a word of what they were saying. Im not even going to mention the ending because you will just have to watch this. Realistically, this movie is a 4.5 but i recommend it for anyone who's into the contemporary gangster style film and definately anyone who's into british mobster films.

2333961,5,B0009X7BD2,"Among other issues that this film settles is who should be the next James Bond - Daniel Craig. Craig delivers, along with the rest of this superb cast, an outstandinglt taut performance of a drug dealer attempting to sift through the double, triple and multi-crosses in as fine and as nuanced and as exciting a crime film as I have ever seen. Supported by Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon, to name just two, plus the sultry Sienna Miller, fresh off boyfriend Jude Law's dalliance with the nanny, Craig is as riveting as Terrence Stamp in THE LIMEY  from a few years back.

Quite honestly this film is as brilliantly conceived and executed as THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and with as surprising an ending as you'll see in any film this year.

I have no idea what all else the DVD will include but the essential mystery of who Daniel Craig's character is will leave Kaiser Sukay fans wanting more.",1122249600,10,884,4.582278481012659
2333962,5,B0009X7BD2,"After an art house release everywhere else in the civilized world, LAYER CAKE (LC) unexpectedly premiered in our area, the Lehigh Valley, at the $4 theater in Easton (this joint started as a second-run theater, but it's been getting some acclaimed imports and indies lately, too. Somebody there is a good programmer!). This British import, adapted by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is a taut crime drama that moves with the sleek menace of a tiger. Imagine THE BIG SLEEP with an ever-so slightly more coherent plot and, as its protagonist, a prosperous, wily drug dealer looking to retire after one last score instead of tough but noble private eye Philip Marlowe. Our hero's problem is that he's a careful, calculating businessman in a dicey business where he's surrounded by loose cannons who shoot, stab, or punch first and ask questions later. Director Matthew Vaughn has been best known as Guy Ritchie's producer, but in his directorial debut Vaughn is like Martin Scorsese to Ritchie's Barry Sonnenfeld (that's meant as a compliment to all concerned, I assure you). It helps that Vaughn gets excellent performances from Daniel Craig as our cool but in-over-his-head unnamed antihero (usually films and books that refuse to name their main character strike me as trying too hard to be clever, but it works here), Michael Gambon nearly stealing the show as a cultured but ruthless narcotics kingpin, Colm Meaney and THE INTERPRETER's George Harris as our protagonist's partners in crime, and many folks from Guy Ritchie's films. Sienna Miller doesn't get to do much beyond being eye candy, but she's tasty eye candy indeed. I'm as heterosexual a gal as they come, but after seeing lithe, leggy Miller strip down to black lingerie and garters, I couldn't help thinking, ""That Jude Law is one lucky guy!"" :-) One of the things I liked about LC is that the protagonist, while thoughtful and competent, is never quite as clever as he thinks he is; somehow everybody manages to be one step ahead of him, if only because they're all so damned unpredictable. Though I've only seen Daniel Craig in three of his many films (the other two were THE ROAD TO PERDITION and THE JACKET), he's clearly one of those actors who never looks or sounds the same from role to role, so if he does indeed end up being Pierce Brosnan's successor as James Bond as rumored, it'll be interesting to see how he fares playing the same character in more than one film! :-) In any case, Craig certainly lives up to the ""new Steve McQueen"" rep that LC has garnered him. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next.  The impressive stash of DVD extras include a making-of doc, a TIME OUT Q&A with Craig and Vaughn, an enjoyable and insightful commentary track by Vaughn and Connolly, the various posters considered, and enough deleted scenes to make a second movie.",1121558400,6,2834,4.807377049180328

2333964,5,B0009X7BD2,"I remember the first time i saw this film around my mates house, couldn't peel my eyes from the screen for the entire movie, its truely fantastic.

The first 10 minutes of the film really captivates the audience as XXXX narrates how it is to be a cocaine dealer, and the majority of the characters are introduced. Life is sweet at the start but after a wannabe gangster known as the Duke (Jamie Forman) get tied into affairs with XXXX and his friends, Morty (George Harris), Clarkie (Tom Hardy) and Terry (Tamer Hassan) things go vastly downhill. The plot twists really throw things about just as you think its gonna click into place.

The emotions of XXXX are portrayed most excellently by Daniel Craig, he really steals the show with his charismatic suave style and excellent narration and acting skills. I think Morty (George Harris) and Gene (Colm Meany) also deserve a mention for upholding truely brilliant acting throughout.

Matthew Vaughn has created a true masterpiece following his success on the production of the legendary Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. The film is shot brilliantly and some very clever camera effects and stylish camera angles are used throughout the film.

Some would say the plot is very complicated, and i agree to the extent that there is a lot to take in quickly as the plot is vast and is constantly on the move throughout the film, however i found that this is what makes the film so great, the portrayal of the high speed risky life of a drug dealer is shown clearly and the twists are brilliant.

The film has an excellent script, some of my favorite quotes..

""Why don't you come round for breakfast, ill sqeeze some orange juice and grind some coffee and we can talk about this adults, hows that sound?"" ""Sounds very hospitable"" ""Do you know where i live?"" ""No"" ""F**k Off Then.""
