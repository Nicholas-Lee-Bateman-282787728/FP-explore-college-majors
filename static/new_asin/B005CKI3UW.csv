8465540,1,B005CKI3UW,"I ordered this for my (adult) classroom and missed the part where it was only 7 MINUTES long.  It is on a very low level and has very little information.  You'll see a worm lizard (i.e. glass snake), a couple of harmless snakes and one viper eating and a few shots of lizard legs and that is about it.  Spend your money on a documentary from Animal Planet or Discovery instead.  I'm not sure why they even made this.",1374624000,2,416,4.227848101265823
