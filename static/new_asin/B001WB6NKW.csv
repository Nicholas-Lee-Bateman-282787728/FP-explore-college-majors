8347466,5,B001WB6NKW,"A great deal of care has been taken in this selection of suspense stories from the glory days of half-hour programming circa 1952-1955.  Well-written program notes.  No duds here.  Each short story is interesting in its own way.  These were intended for an adult television audience, and the quality of these productions is high.  So is the ""noirishness.""

One of these episodes has Dick Powell directed by Robert Aldrich doing a Blake Edwards script!",1310515200,10,451,5.027027027027027
8347467,4,B001WB6NKW,"The 7 episodes on this DVD are from the TV series Four Star Playhouse, The Star and the Story, Suspense, and Counterpoint.  All suspense-oriented episodes.  They look good, are basically splice-free, and there are no watermarks.  Various episodes do have the effects of syndication, where openings are short and ending credits fade out early.  The episodes themselves look good and appear basically complete.  The Suspense episode, ""F.O.B. Vienna"", being a kinescope has some background audio issues.  This episode is also available on the Suspense: The Lost Episodes Collection #3 in slightly better condition with commercials included.",1284508800,18,637,5.583333333333333
