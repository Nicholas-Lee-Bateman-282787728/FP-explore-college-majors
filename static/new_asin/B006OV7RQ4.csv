5011394,5,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Marcy May Marlene is literally one of the most difficult movie titles to remember in recent memory; at least until after you see the film. Shortened to MMMM in movie conversations, when you tell people that title their reply is usually along the lines of, ""That sounds REALLY stupid."" But Martha Marcy May Marlene is pretty much the furthest thing from stupid a film could possibly be. But then if you were try to convince somebody that a movie starring a younger sister of the Olsen twins is not only good but filled with some pretty extraordinary acting, you'd probably be laughed at. If you enjoy independent film, watch the trailer for Martha Marcy May Marlene and go into the full-length film with an open mind. It's practically guaranteed you'll be surprised with what you discover.

Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) has just returned home to her family; Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and her husband Ted (Hugh Dancy). Martha disappeared two years ago without a trace. She never called anyone or let anyone know where she was going; she was just gone. Now that Martha has returned, she doesn't seem right. She acts strangely and can't tell the difference between the past, the present, and events that she dreamed about. But she doesn't want to talk about it. She did however live with a man named Patrick (John Hawkes) on a farm with a group of other women who basically worshipped the ground Patrick walked on. But whatever happened there has tainted Martha. The events that transpired there still haunt her to this day and Martha soon comes to realize that the life she had for two years isn't so easy to run away from.

Martha Marcy May Marlene reels you in right from the start. You see Martha take off into the woods and the shaky point of view that's used along with the positioning of the camera gives you the sense that you're chasing after her, which is basically what you're doing the entire film. There's this constant sense of uneasiness dripping over each frame of the film even before anything is actually revealed. The absence of a score does wonders, but every once in awhile a slow rising high pitched tone can be heard to make things more tense and it works in spades.

The film itself is rather upsetting and almost off-putting in a way. It's incredibly difficult to watch at times, but hard to pull yourself away from at the same time. Elizabeth Olsen is an interesting actress to watch. She spends the majority of the film keeping to herself and not wanting to talk about the hell she's been through the past two years, but her unusual behavior along with how insanity begins to slip through the cracks of the front she puts on in front of her family is the beauty of not only the character but her performance as well. John Hawkes has always been a compelling actor anyway, but he's in top form here. Patrick is a very driven individual. Of course, the way he lives and his ideals are completely off the wall but it's the way he's so calm about it and so confident that makes it believable. Then there's his dark side that's just downright scary. The whole scenario brings to mind a famous serial killer; a certain family from the 1960s.

However like most movies the less you know about Martha Marcy May Marlene going in the better. One of the film's charms is how it transitions between the past and the present. It illustrates to perfection the thought process and current mindset of the Martha character. Marcy's Song, which is performed by John Hawkes, is a beautiful song but its context is genuinely creepy. Most of the conversations between Martha and her sister Lucy are some of the best scenes in the film. Their conversation by the lake while Ted is making dinner is one that stands out. You find yourself just enthralled with the film and just entranced with everything going on, but the ending is kind of a letdown. It's very open-ended and was obviously done to keep you talking (which it has done very successfully), but it didn't feel completely satisfying to me. It doesn't necessarily hurt the film overall, but is just a small nitpick on my end.

Martha Marcy May Marlene is driven by an exceptional cast and an engaging story while being wrapped up in an incredibly unnerving presentation. There doesn't really seem to be a weak actor in the cast as Elizabeth Olsen shows she's a very talented actress and John Hawkes continues to show how talented he really is. Martha Marcy May Marlene keeps you guessing, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is just brilliant storytelling all around.",1320451200,11,4529,4.6491885143570535
5011395,4,B006OV7RQ4,"I saw this one with my wife who loves movies about cult survivors.  This one reminded me a lot of the old movie of the week with Sally Field, Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring, except maybe that one was better.  I knew going in that Martha Marcy May Marlene was going to be telling two stories at the same time.  In the present day, Martha escapes from the dreary routine of communal living and finds her sister now married to Hugh Dancy and living at great expense in a Connecticut mansion.  The other part of the story is a continuous flashbacking to scenes from the past two years spent in the cult, or commune, whatever it was.

Like Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion, poor Martha (played with great finesse by yourg Elizabeth Olsen) is literally scared out of her mind by what she has seen and what she is now imagining.  Could the remaining cult members, led by sinister, Mansonlooking John Hawkes, be after her to kidnap her or perhaps kill her for she knows too much?  She keeps hearing noises on the roof, suspicious noises which her sister Lucy dismisses as pine cones.  After about an hour of this casual approach, I was starting to suspect that Lucy was also involved with the cult and was plotting to drive Martha crazy, perhaps as a way to put her into a mental hospital where nobody could hear her scream.  That's how suspenseful the show is.  On the other hand, I did wonder why, if she was gone only two years, Martha has completely forgotten when to put on clothes and when to go about naked, or the fact that when you're scared, there's a social taboo against barging in on your sister having sex with Hugh Dancy who doesn't like you anyhow.

And also from the other side, why don't Lucy and Ted realize that something traumatic has happened to Martha?  Bring her to the police, don't let her ruin your cocktail parties!  And finally, what kind of cult was it?  At the beginning of the movie, when the softening light reveals the men chowing down at table together, a wave of laughter swept the theater.  They were all so hunky and ripped, bulging out of their overalls as though Bruce Weber had selected and lit them personally.  The women are equally young, beautiful, with perfect bodies.  One woman whispered, ""It must be a cult of supermodels.""",1320019200,3,2266,4.514705882352941

5011399,5,B006OV7RQ4,"This movie really intrigued me. Elizabeth Olsen is outstanding as a young girl who ends up living in a cult for about 8 or so years. The movie does an excellent job of going from present time to when she was in the cult. She escapes one day and contacts her sister, played by Sarah (from American horror story). her name escapes me. she picks martha, (Olsens character) up, and takes her in with her and her husband. she has no idea where Olsen has been all this time. as olsen tries to get back into society, she realizes how confused she is. Her sister and brother and law try to help her, but things just seem to get worse for olsen. she just cant quite adjust, not to mention how terrified her former cult members will find her. she begins to notice strange things and becomes paranoid. Finally, in the end, there is quite the twist. the movie is worth watching",1483574400,3,865,4.345679012345679

5011409,5,B006OV7RQ4,"This is the best dabut film made by new director in the cetury other then ORSON WELL. Period.
Well that good? Maybe I am blinded by the look of Elizabeth Olesn and the director Sean Durkin.
For some reason he worked for a few TV series and still quarrel for making his second feature. Sad very.

This movie again is very very well made charactor driven film.
It won 22 awards include Canne, Sundance.

The movie is about this let's say 24 something woman who dissapeared fo 2 years and comes back to her sister's house and has to stay there with her and her huaband.
She is a strange lady mental problem perhaps. But not like have to go to an asylem kind of crazy.

In this movie again tell us that telling is not everything he says.
The main charactor MARTHA acted by Elizabeth Olesn doesn't reveals much of what really happened over 2 years during her dissapearence but as watching her rather awkward behavior- her swimming totally naked in public, sudden anger at the party, no getting along with anyone being violent without any reason.
But it is more then that. She has this strange way of showing some kind of deep deep emotionally ruined but very charming and vilnerable charactor that want us to study more that makes this movie very mush a true Gem.

Also her true beautiful skin with also beautiful cameran work with perfect ligheneing makes this movie a great art.

The music is rather invisible but it's there.

Also some folk like songs sang by local people matches perfect with the film and it makes the movie more shine.

John Hawkes the roll of the man I don't know is he Martha's lover of her enemy?  is very concrete and lovable sometime overely strong for the charactor that get into Martha.

Among them is someone you should remember that is Julia Garner who will be a star by appearing from the movie <ELECTRICK CHILDREN> you won't forget her for the rest of your life because of that film. But for now just a small roll.

Sarah Paulson the sister is also very charming and did her roll 100%.
Hugh Dancy who acted for the sister's husband is also very lovable and you will ask for more for him to play for other movies.",1472342400,,2140,4.450127877237851

5011418,4,B006OV7RQ4,"I really liked this, and I have to say it is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.  In the end, it's about a deeply disturbed young woman. The question is, is she disturbed because of a two-year stay with a violent Mansonesque cult, or was she delusional in the first place?  How much is real memory, how much is her imagination?  Elizabeth Olsen is just excellent in the lead role, and all supporting players are good.  This is not a film for young people... they won't understand it at all. It isn't surprising to me that the reviews here are all over the board.  It asks questions, doesn't answer some, and there isn't a neat little bow at the end.  It's a film for a mature, thinking person.  If you like that sort of film, you'll like this a lot.",1460332800,5,756,4.28169014084507

5011428,3,B006OV7RQ4,"I really expected to love this film after reading the glowing reviews. I wanted to see it for several years and it was a disappointment. I have to agree with the late, great Roger Ebert that the flitting back and forth between the past and present was a little too clever a plot device without any payoff. He was too generous in giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Devoid of a gratifying payback, the constant past-present-past scene juxtaposition was simply distracting and not that effective a tool to imply psychosis or PTSD. The real problem is that the first-time director Sean Durkin, who also wrote this, did not fully explore how PTSD plays out and effects both the victim and loved ones. None of the scenes led up to a full-blown discussion in which Martha revealed anything enlightening about what happened to her, so her sister and brother-in-law could not feel true empathy towards her. The discussion should have taken place early on, even if there was a reluctance on both sides to tackle it. I kept waiting for this to happen, and it never fully played out.

The highlight of this film was the powerful performance by Elizabeth Olsen, supported by the very talented Sarah Paulson playing her sister, and John Hawkes as the scary cult figure who sucked Martha Marcy May into his disgusting vortex. There are really no spoilers here - the ending is so anti-climatic that my husband let out a loud groan and said it was the worst movie he has ever seen. He was exaggerating, considering he has seen well over 1,000 movies, but I agree that the ending was a cop out and a huge let down after enduring all that angst without any payoff. I am all for enigmatic endings, but this was abrasively abrupt and not effectively done. The very last scene seemed to veer off into what one might expect in a horror movie.",1451520000,5,1820,4.58282208588957

I loved the way that it was shown how Martha was stuck between reality and living inside of her memories, the way that the scenes popped back and forth so that I wasn't sure right away whether it was actually happening or whether she was remembering something, just as if I was feeling what Martha was feeling. The sister and her husband had no idea that Martha had been trapped in a cult for two years, when Martha said that she was living with ""a boyfriend"", they believed that -- they knew that her behavior was strange, but they didn't understand why -- but why and how could they know? It was obvious that Martha had been abused, and I am glad that the movie did not go into that much detail about the abuse.  (If you want to see some gruesome details about the abuse in a cult, then watch ""Savage Messiah"" which is a totally true story, and even then, that movie is extremely mild once you look it all up on Google and see all of the facts.)

I almost didn't catch the ending, because it went by too quickly, but as Martha was being driven away ""to get help,"" a man from the cult ran passed the car, which means that the cult had tracked her down and they knew where she was. So, at the end, you wonder whether Martha went on to get help or whether that cult member pulled her back with him.",1419379200,,1354,4.2

I had read so many strong positive reviews about it that I was anxious to watch it and very disappointed when I did.  The acting was good, but their seemed to be gaps in the storyline that might have made it more compelling to me.  I understood that the direction of the movie was focusing upon portraying the disassociative behaviors and thinking processes of a young woman experiencing PTSD and who may or may not have been mentally imbalanced prior to the truama she experienced that is related to the movie's story line.  I think that this facet of the direction was portrayed fairly accurately.  Regardless, the movie was too dark and conflict laden for me to enjoy on any level.",1405641600,3,758,4.5851851851851855

5011499,3,B006OV7RQ4,"This was not the movie the revue I read said it was.  It was not a thriller (To Me).  This was quite confusing more like a Dangerous Mind movie.  I could not tell if this was to be real or a dream.  The movie should have been set in the 60 ies.  It had much the same concerns as that era with drugs and cults, but again, I had a hard time discerning if it was meant to be real or in her mind and because of that I never really was able to like this movie.
  The main character at times you felt something for, but soon lost that as the movie became weird.  The sister was the typical uptight relative depicted in most 60 ies hippie cult movies.  Her Husband was uncaring and at times controlling, at times and you felt an undercurrent of lust for the sister in law (again much the same as other 60 ies cult movies.
  At times there were no points of reference, it just flashed to a thought or notion she had at that time.  This added to the feeling that this was like Dangerous Mind and all a. dream.
  This movie was not for the entire family.  There were some disturbing things depicted.  The description of the movie on the jacket was not in my opinion  a true depiction of the movie.
  The actress was well suited to the movie.  You could believe she was crazy.  But I never felt much compassion for her.  I liked Dangerous Mind much better.  I looked at two reviews of this movie and watched this due to those revues, but I did not see any of it when I watched the actual movie.

5011512,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Marcy May Marlene is a film that is about a cult's effect upon a young victim's psychology when she escapes from the farm one morning. Earlier we had a vision of young Americana:two men hammer a fence,a goat nearby,women hang washing,a small child toddles about. Martha(Elizabeth Olsen)is like all the other young women are all damaged, drawn in by the blessed out benignity of the group's welcome,run by Patrick(John Hawkes),the charismatic, sociopathic,Manson-like head who binds all the females through the initiation ritual of drugged-out rape. Each female housemate is groomed by a fellow female into thinking this a transformative experience. Martha has her identity reworked by Patrick as a `Marcy May',and he sings her a song he's written for her in the group. Part pervert and part prophet, Patrick and the farm's other male residents take sexual advantage of women recruited from the streets to join their ranks as very second-class citizens.

Retrieved from this limbo by her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson), Martha explains her absence by saying that she'd been betrayed by ""a guy,"" readily authoring a substitute narrative of victimization. The family's beliefs are vague but decidedly anticapitalist; they share clothes, grow their own food, have group sex and group sing-alongs--and commit home invasions when they need money(sometimes with shocking violence).Due to the similarities between the time-share and the farm's rural locations, the film is sometimes purposefully unclear as to where she is and if she's Martha or Marcy May from scene to scene. The film presents her life at the commune in a series of flashbacks, triggered by events in the present,we almost never know where she is or who she is:her state of mind merges with the confused tone of the film. Martha maybe an unreliable narrator,she says ""you can't tell memory from dream"".

In the commune where lines are crossed in the name of goodness,where one person manipulates everyone for their own ends. Acts of violence are disguised as acts of generosity. The manipulation into normality of seizmic acts is made more eerie by the soothing calmness of the atmosphere. Martha herself colludes in drugging another girl for rape. The film asks what it means to belong. Martha is alienated from her own family,her sister Lucy's(Sarah Paulson)brittle aspirations and Ted's(Hugh Dancy) increasing irritations,after Martha accuses him of being a shallow materialist,Martha rants the anti-bourgois cliches she's been inculcated with. Her rejection of conventionality caused her to go into the cult.

Martha's silence about her trauma suggests awkward fragility,but makes any development impossible in the present. Her paranoia is from her fear of the old family coming after her,watching and waiting to reel her back. She is like a wild animal, hunted,trapped,by her senses, by each sound. Olsen is perfect as Martha and John Hawkes reprises the menace of Winter's Bone. Moments of ambiguity and confusion transmit anxiety in a leisurely, understated manner that is more affecting than any extended monologue or horror shock. Durkin's film is like a waking dream,the hallucinatory unravelling of a wounded psyche,shifting uneasily between genres,with no resolution or ending,using subtlety rather than explanation. This is no redemption fable.",1384819200,,3321,5.4073359073359075
5011513,1,B006OV7RQ4,"Boring and weak drama, It is about a cult or local weird family , not sure. messed up situation offered in a very weak drama",1381190400,,124,4.0
5011514,5,B006OV7RQ4,"I disagree with some other commenters on here who are not satisfied with unanswered questions and wants a happily ever after happy ending.  That was not the intent of the director or the actors.

The story line is all too accurately portraying the bizarre behaviors of cult members and how effectively they win over their converts over time.  Most cult members are victims of what is called the
""Stockholm Syndrome"" where the new members become converts and buy into the craziness and identify with their captors.

All too often, the cult leader rapes new women into the fold and these women after a time give in willingly.  This was illustrated all to well with the cult member waking up our heroine out of sound sleep already having entered her (and it is suggested that he took her virginity)and he has not bothered with even a semblance of foreplay.  He enters her from behind and she is indicating pain and tries to get up and he simply pins her to the floor by laying on top of her and quickly finishing.  It is the next day and one of the crazy girls goes rapturously about how beautiful it is to be taken for the first time by the cult leader.

The women all reinforce peer pressure and make the most bizarre things seem normal like killing an innocent man whose house they have broken into.

Marcy tries to escape to normalcy but she has not been de-programmed which is almost always necessary for former cult members.  They have to be reintroduced to the real world because the cult has been their reality.  Marcy's sister and her husband of course are not up to the task and correctly try to get help for the sister and this is where the movie ends with one of the cult members following them in another car and you are left to your own ending to create in your mind.

It is a brilliant character study. Not for teens or younger.",1379462400,2,1840,4.459701492537313
5011515,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Elizabeth Olsen makes a fine debut in this slow-moving, somber-mooded film about a confused, depressed college girl who runs away after her mother's death and finds herself joining a communal cult that becomes more and more Manson Familyish as the film proceeds. MMMM makes very effective transitions between the back-story, set during ""Marcy May""'s cult days, and the front-story, set after ""Martha"" has escaped the cult and is living with her sister (and only surviving immediate family member) and her sister's new husband. Some interesting juxtapositions are drawn between Martha's sister and brother-in-law with certain members of the cult. The most obvious theme of the film is Martha's attempt to readjust to the reality of ""normal, respectable"" existence, but there's much more here. While MMMM makes no attempt to make communal cult-life seem appealing, it also quietly and subtly calls into question the frequent hypocrisy of ""acceptable"" lifestyles. There are some very definite, smartly done layers to this film, and the amount of empathy we attain with the lead character is effortlessly acute.

MMMM's biggest downside is simply that not all that much happens, at least insofar as traditional dramatic action is concerned. Some surprising stuff occurs toward the end, but the drop-into-space ending will leave many wanting to know what happens next. At the same time, however, it leaves room to speculate on just how important what-happens-next really is.",1377561600,4,1469,5.386956521739131
5011516,3,B006OV7RQ4,"While this film may be frustrating to more mainstream audiences, who demand resolutions to every conflict, I believe the more patient and tolerant film-goer will appreciate the slower pace and buildup. Trouble is, the buildup doesn't take you anywhere at all. Like the ending of the final episode of ""The Sopranos"" we're left with a (SPOILER ALERT!!!) fade to black that leaves it to the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably love this movie. The acting by Olsen is sublime, and just like the curtain call on ""The Sopranos"" the ending to this movie is at least honest, if not satisfying. My main problem with the movie is, despite Olsen's brilliant performance, I felt little for her character beyond a frustrated annoyance. Anyone who allows a group of people to subvert who you are, to cut you off from everyone you've ever loved, to go so far as to change your name, well, that kind of weak individual gets little sympathy from this film-goer.",1376870400,2,1003,4.803468208092486

5011520,3,B006OV7RQ4,"This film had an interesting, timely plot: cults and their influence(s). Marcy and her sister, Lucy, are reunited after Marcy's escape from a controlling, potentially violent cult. At first, Lucy seemed happy and relieved to be reunited with her younger sister.....but that soon changes. Lucy and her English husband are obviously upper-middle-class, socially involved people. When Marcy exhibited inappropriate behavior or thoughts/opinions, Lucy and especially her husband seemed more irritated than concerned about what had happened to Marcy previously. I am myself an older sister and I found it hard to relate to Lucy, who seemed less concerned about Marcy's physical and mental/emotional well-being, or any trauma that she might have endured, than she just wanted Marcy to 'snap out of it' or 'be normal.' At many times during the film, I thought that Marcy had escaped one cult only to be plunged into another sort of one with her sister and sister's husband. Lucy kept trying to make Marcy be like her.....an uptight, thin-lipped, impatient, only-concerned-with-outward appearances young woman. After a while and towards the end of the movie, it seemed that Lucy was only interested in 'getting rid of' Marcy because 'we're trying to start a family and I don't feel safe having you around.' During one verbal confrontation between Marcy and Lucy, Marcy exclaims to Lucy, 'You're gonna be a terrible mother!' I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone but I'll just say that you're left with the impression that Marcy's not nearly out of the woods (pardon the pun) in so far as the cult is concerned.",1375056000,,1608,5.11787072243346

Olsen's character Martha, suffers a horrific trauma after she escapes from a cult. Martha has difficulty reconnecting with the outside world and with her sister played Sarah Paulson. Martha doesn't have any healthy boundaries, she was subjected to horrible things during her stay with the cult.

Past and present are expertly intercut, as Martha runs from her memories until they catch up to her and overwhelm her. She reminds me a little of Linda Kassabian, who as a member of the Manson clan eventually woke up and turned against them, and in doing so re-discovered her humanity.

MMMM is the story of a girl who becomes a victim, then a victimizer, and then a witness. It's also a study of missed opportunities and a lack of understanding into both ourselves and the behavior of the ones we love. I got so frustrated at Martha for not being able to put her trauma into words, and at her sister Lucy, who was trying so hard to assuage her own guilt at abandoning a young Martha that she ended up missing every clue that was put in front of her. The thing is, as frustrating as it was, it was also so real, so human in the imperfection of its characters, and that is reflected in the ending (or non-ending, as some critics consider it.) We've been trained to have our movies end neatly and clearly, with the ending we want to see, and I admit I feel the same way. I wish Martha had been able to express to Lucy what happened to her, I wish that Lucy had been able to really hear her... and I still wonder what that last five minutes really meant.

Yet the best thing about Martha Marcy May Marlene is that I've watched it several times; I've become emotionally invested and have continued to think about it, which is more than I can say for most movies last year that got rave reviews. In the end, Martha Marcy Mae Marlene was utterly moving, well-written, beautifully acted, and I'm so glad that I saw it.",1364256000,,1744,4.330275229357798

5011534,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Elizabeth Olsen plays a young woman who has just run away from an abusive cult after witnessing something that should not be disclosed here. Going back and forth in time (a narrative device that I think has been overused these days), ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" follows the story of the titular heroine struggling to shake off her past.

The film attempts to focus the psychological aspect of Martha spiraling into paranoia. It's a worthy attempt told in a unique way, blurring the boundaries between the past and the present, and bolstered by the strong acting of Elizabeth Olsen. Much of the film's emotional power rests on the shoulders of Elizabeth Olsen, whose talent has been much talked about.

However, despite her subtle and nuanced performance as traumatized Martha, as well as John Hawkes's fine portrayal of the cult leader (don't miss his singing Jackson C. Frank song ""Marcy's Song""), the film's story doesn't really convince partly because of the plotline that, if told in linear timeline, sounds pretty implausible (will the cult group let her go so easily?), and partly because of the cardboard supporting characters that surround Martha: Martha's sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson), who should be much worried especially when her sister had been missing for two years; and Lucy's husband Ted (Hugh Dancy), whose rather clichd portrayal of rich and unconcerned husband only disappoints.

First time feature writer/director Sean Durkin knows what he is doing. This is the story of Martha, who finds it hard to run away from her memories that keep haunting - or maybe not just from the memories, as some of the clues strongly suggest. As a psychological drama ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" is certainly fascinating as long as you keep watching the character of Martha or Marcy May.

As she attempts to settle in to a normal life with her sister, she is haunted by horrible images from the past, where she had become part of a hippie commune led by the persuasive and charismatic Patrick. Martha's nightmares, fear, and paranoia continue to build until she is unable to separate her dreams from reality. First-time director Sean Durkin has struck immediate success with MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, the award-winning cult drama from 2011. Durkin delicately interlaces the past and the present as he retells Martha's chilling experiences using an organic story structure. It is terrifying to think just how easily an impressionable mind could be manipulated and controlled in such a way, but Durkin takes all of the right steps in disarming the audience in the same way that Patrick has disarmed his followers, perfectly illustrating the power of coercion and the psychological lures that draw people in to such a group. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Martha, and commits herself mind, body, and soul. There are moments where Martha makes contact with the viewer and causes them to turn away in shame for intruding into her thoughts and emotions. John Hawkes is deadly as Patrick, coming on with a subtle charm that effectively seduces the other characters under his spell before corrupting their minds. MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE will not be easily forgotten, and is a top-contender for Best in 2011.

5011544,4,B006OV7RQ4,"The psychological study ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" is one of the more fascinating films of 2011. An independent critical hit, the subtle drama details a young woman's attempt to adjust to society after years in a rural New York cult. Using the word ""cult"" awakens memories of David Koresh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ashes-of-Waco-An-Investigation/dp/0815605021/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ashes of Waco: An Investigation</a>) and Charles Manson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family/dp/1560253967/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family</a>), and first-time writer/director Sean Durkin has created a quietly menacing atmosphere recalling both cultural disasters.

The film's main character, Martha, joins the cult commune, where men and a larger number of women work the fields of an isolated farm. Existence is anything but sunshine, as days are overcast, laughter kept to a minimum and thunder roils on the horizon. The cult's leader is Patrick, skillfully played by John Hawkes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B00498TQV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>) in yet another role displaying why he's one of the more fascinating talents working today. He juggles word games in seductive Mansonesque manner, discussing death as ultimate nirvana and acceptance of his family's system as the only true love.

Martha's time within the cult is seen in flashback. The film opens with her escaping through the woods as she stumbles to a pay phone. She's soon residing with her older sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law Ted (Hugh Dancy) at their palatial lake house where they are vacationing, sleeping more often than not, unable to discuss where she's been for the last two years. With some trepidation, Lucy and Ted become Martha's protectors, and it's apparent their status-conscious lives have left them ill-equipped to deal with the depth of her mental warfare. A professionally successful Manhattan couple, they're shocked by Martha's uninhibited behavior as she casually goes skinning dipping and enters their bedroom while they're having sex. Martha also has an embarrassingly violent episode during a formal cocktail party.

The passive yet complex role of Martha is brilliantly played by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen. The film is seen almost entirely from her viewpoint as she struggles from paranoia, with dreams of her time within the cult seeping into daily existence. Through reoccurring flashbacks we witness her indoctrination, including forced sex with Patrick and a variety of home invasion crimes. At night she imagines cult members throwing rocks at her window. Like a scarred soldier, Martha is mentally shell-shocked. When Lucy attempts to indoctrinate her into their own society, shown by the clothes provided or the makeup painted onto her face, Durkin is obviously creating a parallel universe of opposing yet oddly similar values. Both are defended passionately. When she questions the need for such a large lake house overflowing with material possessions, she is thoroughly chastised by Ted during a fit of anger. When she voices unhappiness about a crime committed within the cult, she is threatened by Patrick in a similar outburst.

During conversations with Lucy throughout the film, we learn Martha was a school dropout, without parents, making her a perfect target for the cult. We can't help but recall the infamous Manson girls, identically dressed with shaved heads, marching to the courtroom in unison. We read Vincent Bugliosi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helter-Skelter/dp/0553278290/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helter Skelter</a>&nbsp;and see the films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helter-Skelter/dp/B0001AVZM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helter Skelter</a>) where Manson is the dramatic focus. I'm not sure we've seen a work dealing exclusively with a female cult victim and how she begins to follow beliefs opposing American society.

We could question Durkin's intentions when comparing the veiled similarities of respectable society to the cult's sexist and violent existence. When Martha is forced to take tranquilizers after her outburst at the cocktail party, we are reminded of the drugs used by the cult during her indoctrination. There's also intended irony in the film's final conflict, when Lucy realizes Martha needs serious help. She is to be committed to an institution where she will be cared for and reprogrammed to learn new morals and values, which is exactly what happened within the cult.

Let me honestly say I hated the ending of ""Martha Marcy May Marlene."" With contemplation, I realized it was imaginings within Martha's damaged mind. She's unable to swim or even drive down a sunny street without seeing ominous signs of cult members nearby. Martha was traumatized, akin to veterans of war, and has a long way to go before escape. Where Durkin goes a step further is by asking, ""Escape to what?"" A uniquely haunting film, beautifully photographed, that will get under your skin.",1353888000,4,5191,6.017591339648173

5011547,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Mercy May Marlene (there's a recurring theme this evening- I keep watching movies with annoying titles) is one of the more unusual films out there.  It's probably not worthy of 4 stars but because it did its job in keeping my attention focused on the storyline, I'm impressed... for the most part.

While the reviewers below are correct that it IS a very confusing movie, let me try to describe the key elements that I was able to grasp.  A young girl escapes from a cult that apparently keeps young women locked up, and it seems several men rape these women whenever they choose.  Now this one particular scene in the very beginning is pretty disappointing because of how it avoids bringing attention to the severity of the way the girl escapes.  In other words it should have been seen as a really big deal but instead the girl escapes to a restaurant, grabs something to eat, and apparently one of the cult members comes inside and demands that she returns to him (them) while she's sitting at a table.  Not really sure who that guy was.  Again, the storyline is confusing, but he didn't seem demanding enough and actually let the girl continue her escape plan.

She then calls her sister on the phone (more like her mother given the age difference) and her sister allows the poor girl to live with her and her family.  Of course a big plothole here is that nobody seemed really concerned that this girl was apparently lost for 2 years and rather shockingly nobody felt the need to question where she was or what exactly happened.  Even when these questions were brought up, they were never addressed in a satisfying manner.  Of course the girl should have come right out and TOLD her sister that she was raped but... she held back.  Why, well, that's up for speculation I suppose.  Maybe she was too embarrassed or maybe she was trying to block out the horrible events.  Hey, she never really felt close to her sister, so perhaps she wasn't comfortable revealing such shocking news to her own sister.

The story is definitely a slow-moving one, and the eerie silence that occupies the background is a continuous theme.  Another aspect that's confusing pertaining to the storyline is that, gradually, more girls are brought to the home.  Apparently it's a safe haven for kidnapped girls.  However none of the girls get the attention that Marcy May (or whatever her name is) does.  With all these faults, I really should lower my rating to a 3 but I just can't.  I was curious how the story would unravel and entertained overall.

Anyway the girl being raped so many times apparently meant she learned to think such sexual activity is normal so, in one example, she walk into her sisters bedroom while she's having sex with her husband and thought it was perfectly normal.  Of course the sister gets angry when she realizes Marcy is lying on her bed and resting her head *while* the sister is going at it with her husband.  Strange storytelling.

I really didn't understand the ending at all, or for that matter, the few events that led up to it.  Without spoiling what happens, let's just say there must have been a connection of sorts that I didn't realize.

Overall, not a bad film but sort of lacking in the excitement category.  Maybe you'll understand it better than I did.",1347494400,,3288,4.624137931034483
5011548,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Creepy but ultimately hollow movie (plus many SPOILER ALERTS coming up so...read on at your own risk). The acting is first-rate and Elizabeth Olsen is a force to be reckoned with. The main problem is the flashing back and forth between the past and present gets annoying after awhile. Plus it relies way too much on cinematic tricks such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (MMMM) talking about something, say, in the present but as the camera pans it'll show her in the past as the scene continues. Clever, yes, but super annoying when it's overused.

Lastly, the cult is never explained and I'm all for leaving things up in the air but what was the point of it all? Free sex for the guys in the cult. Plus what was up with the guys singing songs playing acoustic guitars? Let alone what is the need to show MMMM being raped not once but twice in this flick.

The worst part is the fact MMMM calls her sister after two years of no contact and her sister never really questions what MMMM has been up to? Even after MMMM climbs into bed while her sister and her husband are doing the horizontal mambo and  the freakout over that ends with a thud.

Even worse for some reason the DVD I got when you go to the extras nothing happens except a few scenes loop over and over. The whole thing is plain odd.",1346889600,4,1291,4.322314049586777

Jaw-dropping performances are the hallmark of ""Martha Marcy May Marlene,"" a grimly fascinating look into a damaged soul.

Martha (the astonishing Elizabeth Olsen) has grown up with virtually no guidance or support from a parental figure.  She does have an older sister, Lucy (the equally superb Sarah Paulson), who feels ill-equipped to deal with the demands placed on her by Martha's wayward ways.  Lost and confused, Martha thus becomes the perfect candidate for a bizarre communal cult to draw into its web, a cult tucked away in a rural portion of upstate New York, one that is based on a strict patriarchal system and ruled over by a messianic figure (John Hawkes) who sexually and psychologically abuses the girls in his charge.  Though we don`t know how long she`s been there, we meet Martha on the night she`s decided to make a run for it by fleeing into the nearby woods.  She eventually makes it to her sister's home in Connecticut, but Martha soon discovers that it's a great deal easier to break away from such a place physically than it is psychologically.

And does she bring emotional baggage with her!  The problem is that she keeps it all bottled up inside, refusing to let her sister in on any of the experiences she's been through.  As a result, Lucy and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy), are left frustrated and baffled by her bizarre behavior and completely ill-equipped to help her overcome her problems.

""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" (Marcy May is the name conferred on her by the cult leader) is a haunting, understated film where much of the drama seems to be taking place beneath the surface of the action.  The screenplay by Sean Durkin, who also directed the film, moves seamlessly back and forth between the present time set in Connecticut and Martha's recent experiences at the commune.  In some ways, Martha seems like a smart, level-headed young woman who's equipped with enough in the way of survival skills to get her this far in life.  Yet, she is also obviously highly vulnerable and easily influenced, and her ability to so easily lose sight of long-established social mores speaks to the far-reaching effect the cult leaders have had on her.

The movie doesn't provide the audience with easy answers, nor does it assuage their concern for the character with anything remotely resembling a conclusive ending.  It respects the characters too much to be in any way untrue to them.  Watching this extraordinarily well-acted film is like observing a fascinating but challenging case-study in morbid psychology.  We're there to monitor, not to judge.",1343347200,3,2586,4.908045977011494
5011550,3,B006OV7RQ4,"This is a peculiar film indeed--that doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's quite different from most films you might see. Most unusual is the fact that we get no ""backstory"" for the main story. The film opens with Martha/Marcy May/Marlene (Elizabeth Olsen in a tortured yet incredibly nuanced performance) escaping a cult in upstate New York to reunite with her estranged sister and her sister's husband. Flashbacks fill us in on what happened to Martha/Marcy May/Marlene while she was a cult member, yet we never learn how or why she became a member of the cult or why she stayed as long as she did.

The present action--Martha/Marcy May/Marlene's awkward attempts to reconnect with her family despite what her brother-in-law characterizes as her ""insane"" behavior--focuses mainly on what can only be described as the post-traumatic stress that Martha/Marcy May/Marlene is incapable of dealing with. Her time in the cult has rendered her inert and paranoid, and the film ends as abruptly as it began, with a bizarre traffic incident, the meaning of which seems to fade into oblivion along with Martha/Marcy May/Marlene's future.

Fans of quirky, introspective, and artsy films will have a lot to chew on after watching this one. If it's action or conventional storytelling you want, best look elsewhere.",1342224000,3,1308,5.107476635514018
5011551,5,B006OV7RQ4,"MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is NOT a psychological thriller in the normal sense of the genre, and I don't like the idea that it's been marketed as one. This film is the examination of a young woman who has had her psyche played with, twisted, and ultimately rewritten through the machinations of a very charismatic cult leader.

For those of you casual moviegoers who are thinking about renting or buying the film, think about it like this: Remember the scene in THE AVENGERS when Loki sticks his scepter into Agent Barton's chest and it gives him the power to take over his mind? Imagine the process behind that 10 seconds of screentime turned into a two-hour film.

Again, that might sound boring to some, and those are the people who are giving this film a one-star review. I don't necessarily blame them. This is a film being touted on this very page as a ""psychological thriller"", and that evokes certain ideas of a more visceral nature, but while I don't blame them, I certainly would never agree with them.

MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is one of those rare gems where the film is so hyped and so well-reviewed within the indie film circuit and it actually lives up to the praise it deserves. The way that the film could actually honestly be construed as a psychological thriller is in the way that the viewer is sent on this incredibly unsettling and emotionally terrifying journey into the mind of a young girl who's mind has been ripped apart and rebuilt to suit the needs of others that any attempt at normalcy is likely futile.

It's unsettling in every way: Amazing performances are turned in by most of the cast here first and foremost by relative newcomer Elizabeth Olsen (who thankfully is taking a much different career path from her two older sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley) and the always fantastic John Hawkes, who despite turning in great performances for years in the mostly indie circuit, he was finally recognized in a more official way in 2010 by being nominated for his performance in the similarly unsettling WINTER'S BONE. Also in terrific form is Sarah Paulson (who I only really remember from the great HBO original film GAME CHANGE) as the sister who tries everything to assist. Also the narrative structure as composed by writer/director Sean Durkin in his masterful feature debut is quite unsettling as well. With the seamless transition between Martha's present and her past, we're never jerked or yanked to either place (which is a trope of present/past/present transition), but rather just transported.

Many reviews comment or complain on how ""stupid"" the ending of this film is because it doesn't seem to have one. This is actually one of Durkin's strengths showing through and one of the film's greatest strengths. This is a film that is designed to make you think long after the credits have rolled; the imperative word being THINK. 99% of films out there are fully content (and most of them rightfully so) to give you the ending so that when the credits roll, you leave the experience with a sense of closure. I'm not saying this is wrong; most films deserve a clear-cut ending. But Durkin is a smart enough filmmaker to say that THIS film doesn't get an ending; he's saying to the audience that, like Martha, you don't know how this is going to end and that is one of the things that makes this film so haunting. You think about it for hours and days.

As a brief side note, there's one of the one-star reviews here claiming that this film would have worked better in the 60's or 70's because this was only happening then and it just doesn't happen anymore. If anything, there are more of these small cults around than ever. Young people are very malleable, and if you have a leader that is strong, charismatic, and seemingly loving, they end up exactly where Martha ends up. It's dangerously ignorant to believe that this doesn't happen in this day and age. This isn't some kind of fantasy film about an alternate universe; this happens a lot more than most people would like to think.

Watching this film was a wholly unnerving experience, and it's so wonderful in its execution of honest performance and uniformly disturbing story. MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is a film that will challenge you and it will force you to think long after the credits roll, and hopefully will also catapult Elizabeth Olsen into stardom as well as allow Sean Durkin to continue making such fantastic films.",1341532800,6,4419,4.731168831168831

You've really just have to watch it and feel it and let it get into your head and move around. The less you know, the better. So I won't spoil it by trying to talking about it in those terms.

As both writer and director of M4 (my shorthand abbreviation), Durkin has shown everyone the craft and care that's possible from an independent filmmaker with a low production budget (under $1 Million), but a great story to tell and the passion to tell it. The real key to the success of M4 is in the excellent performances of the cast, led by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen, the relatively unknown third sister of the Olsen Twins. Olsen embodies the psychologically troubled character of Martha with chilling emotional depth. She seems to have REALLY gotten into the head of Martha, which is not the best place to be, and brought everything within her to the surface for us to feel and experience in a dreamlike manner. And with a solid supporting cast of character actors that includes John Hawkes, Hugh Dancy, Sarah Paulson, and Brady Corbet, the world of an un-named rural Northeast cult is brought to eerily rich life.

M4 is a smart, mysterious, and confusing psychological drama. While Durkin has written a story that keeps you guessing, it also keeps you an arm's length away from understanding some of it's details, which is both good and bad. Overall, I think it's well-written and engaging, but there were times during the film where I had to simply let go of figuring something out at the moment and just follow along in a murky mist. If there is one major weakness in M4, I think it is in some of the seemingly abstract aspects of the story. But that may also be what makes the movie stand out from the crowd too. Only time will tell. I need to watch the film again to really talk more about it's themes and ideas.

The visuals in M4 have a dark, gritty, and grainy feel, having been shot on 35mm film in what I assume was mostly natural light. And there is an incredible beauty in the shadows and gritty gray areas of the frame. I love crisp, clear and detailed digital cinematography, but 35mm film really worked well in telling this story. Cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes completely captured the perfect visuals here. I was constantly engaged in appreciating the compositions of each and every sequence, admiring the craftsmanship of the team behind the camera.

Probably the most striking filmmaking aspect of M4 is the editing. Lead Film Editor Zachary Stuart-Pontier gave us one of the most finely edited films of 2011. The transitions between the present and the past, memory and reality, are seamless and a wonder to watch. The flow and feel of the film really came together in the editing room and took this good story with its great visuals and performances and made it something more. I'm guessing that the editing team spent A LOT of time in Post putting this film together. And it truly paid off.

Hand in hand with the editing is really stellar sound work by the sound team. The moments of quiet, the moments of just sound, the music...they all come together like they should in a psychological film like this. Again, I was continually impressed as I was watching this movie at how the editing of the visuals, together with the sound, really told this story right. Not much else to say. While the production design is simple and understated, I definitely felt transported into the rural Northeast location. The farm, the lake house, and everything in between just works. Chad Keith and his team did a great job of creating the physical world of M4 and bringing all the pieces together.

2011 was a strong year for small, independent films. And Martha Marcy May Marlene is at the top of the list of those movies. It's the perfect film to check out on Blu-ray or DVD some Saturday afternoon or evening when you want to escape into the mind of a mystery.",1338249600,3,4365,4.565772669220945
5011557,4,B006OV7RQ4,"I wasn't going to write a review, but taking a look at the negative points of veiw on this film I had to. I'm not going to lie, the movie is slow. One reviewer wrote that this movie felt like it belonged in the 60's or 70's, and I couldn't agree more, it just has that style and feel to it. My issue is this, when people cite that Martha just seems stupid and formless and clay like, this is the part of the film I found interesting. She has been with a cult for two years. She has been brainwashed, and abused, mentally, sexually and emotionally, after two years of that kind of abuse you don't come out the same person you came in as. This is a girl who already has her past mistakes when she runs from home, and is then wounded and scarred in ways no typical human being can imagine, because the majority of us don't live a cult life. She then comes back to her sister only to second guess her decision to leave and be haunted by the horrors of her past. In my opinion this is a great and accurate work of the abuse from cults and its effect on people. Does it run slow? Yes it does, so just have some patience, tell your ADD to take a backseat, and learn.",1338249600,,1159,4.043478260869565

But what started with alot of promise built on good dialogue and character development ended with what could be described as a quit. Literally, you get the sense that the director and writer just decided they couldn't fit the story into the budget or had gotten themselves in too deep and just wanted to wrap it up. Based on that alone, I wouldn't recommend the movie. The feeling of disappointment is just too great.",1338076800,3,503,4.662921348314606
5011559,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Writer and director Sean Durkin crafts a film that is a glimpse into a tortured and destroyed psyche, it is a film about a crazy cult and the systematic brainwashing they undertake to keep their victims in it. Elizabeth Olsen, the sister of the famous twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, brings such an intensity that is both frightening and horrific at the same time. The title of the film is a series of names Olsen has. Her name is  Martha. She is given the name Marcy May by  a cult member when she joins the cult. And Marlene is the name used by all the women in the cult to answer the phone
The opening scenes show sister (Sarah Paulson) picking Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) as she tries to flee from the cult. The rest of the film deepens the mystery about her....The cult is run by John Hawkes ( Winter's bone) and he is chilling and cruel. Through the film which is in flashbacks and present day we learn about the cult, about women getting initiated and raped by him, orgies are okay and sometimes murders as well . Martha joins her sister and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy), at a summer house .But things are not normal as she fears that the cult is out to get her and she struggles with normalcy.
Durkins film is an eye opener about how cults operate and people getting sucked in to them. The initial initiation scene of her getting raped and then the new recruit being prepped by her for her master with a herbal cocktail of drugs are chilling. Elizabeth Olsen is excellent in every scene.
The end of the film is disturbing because the outcome is unknown. 4 stars. 4/29/2012",1337472000,,1580,4.426116838487973
5011560,5,B006OV7RQ4,"A lot of critics had an issue with the ambiguous ending, but I think it worked.  The film is less plot driven and more of a character study, anyway.

Martha is a lonely, cautious soul. We learn, through casual dialogue, that she had an absent father, a mother who died and left Martha in the care of an aunt, and an older sister who meant well but was off at college for Martha's formative years.  The movie wisely makes her childhood isolating, but not an over-the-top horror show of tragedies and abuse.  What happens to Martha could happen to a lot of people who feel alone.

At the start of the film, Martha runs away from a secretive commune set in a lovely, if broken down, farm.  We understand that Martha has been in this isolated place for a while, because when she calls her sister from a pay phone, she seems unsure of where she is or how long she's been away.  Martha moves in with her sister Lucy and brother-in-law in their palatial summer home.  Lucy tries to figure out what happened to Martha, but doesn't quite know how to deal with this odd, closed-off girl . . . or Martha's increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior.  Through Martha's memories, we learn the disturbing details of the commune (really a cult) -- and the reasons for Martha's increasing fear.

What's most compelling - and most upsetting - are the flashbacks of Martha's indoctrination into the cult.  We watch with a sinking heart as the members of the cult use the language of love, acceptance and family to slowly break down Martha (renamed by the cult leader ""Marcy May"") and convince her that their strange way of life - and their domination by spooky cult leader Patrick - is ""truly good.""  (Be warned - some of the cult flashbacks are strong stuff - this is no movie for kids).

The acting is superb, especially by Elizabeth Olsen, but also by the actors playing the bewildered Lucy and her husband, John Hawkes as Patrick, and the actors playing the three cult members who ""guide""/bully Martha in the cult.

Effectively creepy and thought-provoking.",1336176000,,2043,4.623268698060942

5011562,4,B006OV7RQ4,"It's not an action film: it's a psychological movie.

This is one of the most intelligent psychological movies I've seen. I was riveted to my seat to see where Martha's decision to leave the cult would take her: the movie concists of a series of revelations about what she does and doesn't understand now that she's outside of the cult. In spite of her escape from the farm, it's as if her mind is under water, struggling to emerge into clarity and complete rejection of the cult, but her mind is still controlled by the cult's influence. It's pretty horrifying for the viewer to grasp just how delusional she has become in the company of psychopaths, and I was not at all disappointed by the end of the movie. Are we surprised that she is as passive as she has been throughout the film? No: her will has been just about completely broken by Patrick.

We see some fine performances here, including a justifiably celebrated one from Elizabeth Olsen and another excellent one by John Hawkes (Winter's Bone).

The reviews of this film on amazon.com are shaping up, as I like to call it, as ""bipolar.""  Lots of 5's, lots of 1's, and not so many in between. Your basic love-it-or-hate it deal. I've noted that often the movies with reviews distributed this way are slower-paced films, and especially those with ambiguous ending. ""MMMM"" builds up a lot of tension in the course of the movie and then gives us a really ambiguous endings. I almost always side with the folks who like the uncertain endings. Loved, for example, ""No Country for Old Men.""  Gotta say, though, this ending did bug me quite a bit. It's not so much that the ending wasn't spelled out--the film gives you plenty of information about whether it's a good or bad ending--it's just that there's nothing artful in the way the ending is presented.

That said, it's generally a very well crafted movie about some things about which we don't see enough good art. I've never seen a better movie on cults and rarely do we see psychological torment so realistically and painfully portrayed.

Their portrayal of brainwashing and cult mentality. Also the resulting distortion of morals and the abandonment of normal ethics.

5011571,4,B006OV7RQ4,"In Martha Marcy May Marlene Elizabeth Olsen stars as the young woman who has just made her escape from a cult - and its charismatic but dangerous leader - and is trying to assimilate herself back into life with her older sister and her sister's husband (Sarah Paulson and Hugh Dancy).

Martha - or Marcy May as she was known in her other 'family' - has trouble fitting in with the very different life her sister and brother-in-law are living. Soon memories - and even possible delusions - lead to increasing paranoia that only make it even harder for the very different Martha to pretend she's fine.

Elizabeth Olsen's acting in Martha Marcy May Marlene is really fantastic (it may or may not be her first feature film, not sure which she did first this or Silent House). Her acting combined with the background we get make it easy to see how someone could be drawn into a cult - and stay for so long despite the abusiveness.

The interactions between Martha, her sister and her brother-in-law are downright strange at times but not in a 'hunh?' way at all. They're strange in a way that actually makes perfect sense for the characters and the experiences they've had.

I was really disappointed by the very, very, very end of the film - but I liked the other 100 or so minutes enough that I can forgive it (or forget about it). That and I really can't wait to see Elizabeth Olsen in something else.",1332979200,,1399,4.496062992125984

5011573,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Put newcomer Elizabeth Olsen on the list of brilliant young actresses filling the movie screen these days.  In this psychological thriller, twentyish Martha Marlene (Olsen) leaves home after her mother dies.  We don't know why, but she severs contact with her older sister, Lucy (excellent Sarah Paulson) who is married to Ted (Hugh Dancy).  Somehow she ends up at a commune of sorts, headed by one of those Charles Manson types, but without the visible menace.  Patrick (good as usual John Hawkes) clearly runs the show for his collective of young women and young men.  What happens to them when they get older?  We do know that occasionally children are born, but against all odds they are always boys.  Hmmm.

After Martha (now renamed Marcy May by Patrick) is sexually abused, she decides to slip away into the woods.  She finds her way into town and calls her sister on a pay phone.  It's been 2 years but Martha doesn't know where she is.  She thinks it's in upstate New York.  Huh?  Lucy, at their vacation house in Connecticut, goes to pick up Martha and returns with her to their picture perfect house on a picture perfect lake.  Their primary residence is in New York City where they work.

Martha drifts in and out of rational behavior, often reverting to scenes of her experience at the compound.  This gives us some insight of her plight, but we're never quite sure of her state of instability.  I found it unrealistic that she wouldn't remember basic manners or that skinny dipping in front of your just-met brother-in-law would be frowned upon.  After all she was only away for 2 years, but in this time it seems reality has left her.  This leads to paranoia as to whether Patrick and the gang would go after her.  This may be credible as one of her flashbacks involves a random and horrific home invasion perpetrated by Patrick and the girls (more Manson comparisons).

While unusual endings are to be expected in film, this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  The fine performances are worth watching.  Technically the movie is excellent.  Great visuals, wonderful cinematography and a creepy score help add to the tension.  Ultimately however, the film leaves much to be desired.  There are too many unanswered questions and not enough clues to help the viewer formulate a hypothesis.  See it for the acting, see it for a remarkable performance by Elizabeth Olsen but don't expect satisfaction.

The Blu ray transfer is 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  I didn't see this film in the theater previously so I'm not sure how much of the post production work mimics the original, but I thought many of the scenes unusually soft with heightened greys and blacks.  I suspect this was the director's intent but it is noticeable.  Other scenes in brightly lit rooms are excellent including facial close-ups, kitchen appliances and the like.  Audio is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is generally solid.  The score opens up the rear speakers along with chirping crickets and other creatures adding to the creepy scenes.

5011578,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Basically this is a movie about a young woman who runs away from a cult to go live with a sister who she hasn't talked to in years and her sister's husband.  It seems that Martha is genuinely terrified by the cult and has painful memories that fuel her paranoia.  Once with her sister, Martha seems to behave in ways that would have been acceptable for the cult but are just whacked out to the average person.  For instance, in one scene Martha curls up in bed with her sister and her sister's husband while they are having sex.  When they freak out, Martha replies that the bed was big and they were on the other side so she didn't think it was a big deal.  Martha's sister and brother-in-law take notice of Martha's increasingly odd behavior and are very concerned.  The brother-in-law and sister both seem to become annoyed with Martha, but her sister seems to feel some sort of obligation to her little sis.  Martha reveals nothing to either of them - she just drops hints of how she understands there are different ways of living, etc. but she never comes out and tells them of the sexual abuse she's suffered or the brainwashing.  Her flashbacks of life in the cult are vivid and the leader is extremely creepy, manipulative and sadistic in a matter-of-fact way.  Martha's paranoia eats her alive as she starts to believe the cult is looking for her.  It seems she has some sort of guilt associated with the fact that she has participated in leading other girls into the cult, drugging them, etc.  It also appears at times as if she's not quite sure what has happened concretely, as if reality has blurred into something that she's not sure is a memory or a bad dream.  She's so out of sorts that her traumatic past bursts through the surface ending in her sister and brother and law committing her to a mental institution.  Elizabeth Olsen is fantastic and plays the role of Martha with intelligence, cynicism, wit and beauty.  She's so believable if you didn't know this was a movie, you would think that she had actually lived through this.  There's no great surprise ending or dumb plot where the cult kidnaps her, but this is a very dramatic realist take on what could possibly happen to someone put in this situation.  Her mental breakdown is practically unavoidable, but you aren't certain if she even views it as such.  This movie was done well, but if you don't like artsy, cerebral dramas you probably won't enjoy it.

One of them is a flashback which tells the story of how Martha got involved with a low-rent agrarian hippie commune and the other is present day following her after her escape. This works very well because for the first half, you see that her life with the commune had really horrific sides to it. But then in ""the real world,"" you see that there are aspects of her commune life that, horrors aside, Martha prefers to life with her sister and husband. I thought for a time that the movie might be about why she decided to go back to the commune as the cult-life was so seductive. Then, the movie takes a dark turn and you understand why she left. The title itself is a mystery as it doesn't make sense all the different names. By the time you understand the title, you can't imagine the movie called anything else.

This film would have worked better back in the late 60s and 70s, when kids ran away from home and joined communes.  Everyone shares every thing, including their bodies.  It just doesn't work in this millennium.

Basic Plot:  Martha's mother dies.  Her sister is in college.  She lives with a bitch of an aunt.  She runs away and is taken in by a farm commune.  Two years later, she's had enough and phones her sister to come and get her.  Her sister soon discovers that Martha has really radical ideas about money, property, open sex, etc.

There is a major plot hole:  Did Martha not have a personality and values prior to joining the commune?  She acts like she is a visitor from another planet who does not understand communistic farm life or human relationships.  She is a dumb valueless lump of clay that they can mold.  Who was she for the first 18 years of her life?

I was surprised, and not in a good way. I expected some type of resolution, and I didn't get it. But all and all, a fantastic film.

5011586,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Spent the evening watching this film, I finished it and it left me with mixed feelings. There is no denying that it was some what fresh with a new idea, quite original I'd say.

the story is that of a young girl Martha "" played by Elizabeth Olsen "", who tries adapting to her life with her family after fleeing a group of a weird cult whom she lived with for about two years.
its quite an original concept, at least for me, as the director takes us back into Martha's past while living with the cult in flashback, I usually am not a big fan of films that relies heavily on flashbacks, i feel it disrupts the stream of the film, however, the director executed it skillfully.

the film was more of a character study, something I like very much in movies since my work involves analyzing people and the way they think. the character of Martha was very intriguing to me as she goes through her inner struggle trying to adapt to a normal life after the strange and bizarre practices she witnessed and participated in with that cult group. she was clearly damaged.

Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Ashley and Mary - kate Olsen, the rich twins known from the 80s - 90s family T.v series Full House, was surprisingly good here, I've never seen her before in any work, and so I never thought she's that good, especially with a complex character like Martha. Bravo..I predict a bright future for her in movies.

Now why the mixed feelings ? well, it was a bit depressing and while i enjoyed the character of Martha and was impressed by the concept of the film, it moved in a very slow pace. the director spends a lot of time in certain scenes that could have easily been edited for a faster pace, but i can understand why, as he wants the audience feel the reality of the scenes, and i think he succeeds in doing so. however, certain scenes were too long.

In the end, I was surprised with this film, in a good a way, it was different, focusing on the character and the inner struggle, but it didn't leave me with a good feeling for a number of reasons. I also don't think this film is for everyone, people might feel bored with the slow pace, especially those who are looking for a Thriller or a Horror.
I'd say 8 out of 10

5011594,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011)
Drama, 102 minutes
Directed by Sean Durkin
Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Sarah Paulson and John Hawkes

I don't like to read reviews before I see a film for the first time, but my curiosity was piqued when so many critics named Martha Marcy May Marlene among their favorite films from 2011.

For some reason, I expected the story to be about a woman with multiple personality disorder. That wasn't the case, but identity is one of the main themes.

This is a film that will alienate a lot of potential viewers. The plot is non-linear and often transitions quickly from Martha's memories to her present reality. There's also a lot of nudity and a small amount of sex. Both are essential to the plot.

Martha (Olsen) is in her early 20s and we see her join a cult in the first five minutes of the film. She's uncertain of her role at first, but soon begins to feel like part of the community. The cult is led by Patrick (Hawkes) and he is quietly persuasive. He gradually asserts his will over the other cult members and sleeps with the women. He thinks that Martha looks more like a Marcy May, so that becomes her name while she is a member of the cult.

The story deals with Martha's attempt to rejoin society after she decides to escape from the cult. She makes a phone call to her older sister, Lucy (Paulson), who picks her up and invites her to stay with her and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy). The scene involving the phone call is accompanied by some disquieting music reminiscent of a David Lynch film. In fact, with Martha seemingly capable of almost anything, you won't feel comfortable at any point in the film. You're not supposed to.

Martha has no idea of how to behave in normal society. She's used to sleeping in a room filled with other cult members and feels isolated when she's alone. Her time as a member of the cult has also affected the way she eats and drinks. She thinks nothing of swimming naked or walking in when her sister is having sex. This is perfectly acceptable behavior in her mind after her recent experiences.

The film regularly shows a scene in the present and then cuts to a scene in the recent past to illustrate the difference between Martha's two worlds. I know plenty of friends who would be irritated by the choice to tell the story in such a manner, but I think it works. It reminds me of Memento in some ways because Martha's experiences feel more immediate if we see things from her viewpoint.

I also found myself thinking about the lifestyles we choose. Lucy and Ted are typical of most people. They judge success in terms of money and possessions and take great pride in their house. When Martha says it's too big for two people, they explain that they like to entertain. They clearly want to be viewed as successful by their friends. That point is highlighted when they plan a party. Lucy dresses Martha in some of her clothes and fixes her hair. She tells Martha she looks beautiful. But the reason she does it is not to make Martha feel special, but to show her friends how wonderful her younger sister is.

There's a sense of unease throughout the film because it's possible that the cult could look for Martha. She even asks at one point how far away their house is from the place Lucy picked her up. Does she fear being recaptured, or does she have some other purpose in mind and is wondering how far she will have to travel to rejoin them?

I think that's more than enough information about the plot, except to say that the conclusion is completely open-ended. You'll have to make up your own mind about Martha's future. I haven't mentioned who Marlene is, but it's fairly obvious when you watch the film.

The acting is particularly convincing. Hawkes does a great job of quietly asserting his authority over the group and even sings a song for Marcy May. Olsen delivers an outstanding breakthrough performance and will surely pick up some other good roles because of this film. Along with Ellen Page, she'll be a popular choice when a movie requires a character in her early 20s.

I found myself thinking about the film the day after I saw it and that's usually a good sign. I think it's one of those stories which will assume greater significance on repeat viewings and I'm interested to see where Sean Durkin takes us with his next project.",1330819200,5,4327,4.5191815856777495
5011595,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Right now you probably know Elizabeth Olsen as the younger sister of the tycoon Olsen twins. After you see Martha Marcy May Marlene, you'll know her as an actress of uncommon subtlety and feeling. It's a sensational performance in a gripping psychological thriller, from gifted first-time writer-director Sean Durkin, that reveals its secrets in the silence between words.

Olsen plays Martha, a young woman we meet on the day she decides to run away from a cult located in the Catskills. Durkin and the skilled cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes present scenes of life in the cult farmhouse with a painterly serenity that only later flashbacks will dispel. After two years in this life, Martha calls her older sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson), who unblinkingly offers Martha the comfort of the Connecticut lake house she shares with her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy).

Adjustment doesn't come easy for Martha, who thinks she can deprogram herself without telling anyone else about her ordeal. Lucy and Ted going at it in bed doesn't deter Martha from climbing in with them. And the fear of simple socializing almost matches Martha's terror of being found out and pulled back to the cult.

Durkin shows us Martha's past in sequences of escalating menace. John Hawkes is indelibly hypnotic at conveying the brilliance and brutality of Patrick, the cult leader who seduces Martha into a life subservient to only one ego: his. When the outside world intrudes, female cultists - whose sexual initiation with Patrick is labeled a ""cleansing"" - use the name Marlene. But Patrick thinks Martha looks like a Marcy May (title mystery solved). Gradually the film emerges as a mesmerizing meditation on identity. Paulson shines as a woman who can't figure out who her sister really is. We share her impatience, especially when Patrick stages a violent invasion. But it's Olsen, as a damaged soul clinging to shifting ground, who makes this spellbinder impossible to shake.

5011596,5,B006OV7RQ4,This movie is very unique.  It is filled with suspense and the director has done a great job at seamlessly switching between scenes so that you don't know what's currently happening and what happened in the past until something appears which gives you context.

They never fully explained the ""Marlene"" part of her name.  It started to, but as with most of this movie, some things were just ideas that seemed to fall flat.

The actors were great in their rolls, but it was a poor script that never managed to wrap itself back around to make any sense.

I heard so many good reviews when this movie came out that I really expected something far better.  However, when a movie doesn't resolve itself and has a screwy ending that leaves the viewer wondering what just happened, it's not good.

But, about a third of the way into the movie the uneven, over-the-top and exaggerated portrayals of each raised some flags. What's the point I asked myself? It got even worse when the script got into into typical media exaggerated stereotypes. The middles class family is focused on appearance, partying and the spotless oversized home. The commune sister joins the other young women as a household slave and as a sex slave to what might be inbred male members. The commune that professes sustained farming and similar ideals as a goal instead shoots cats, robs homes and kills innocent home owners.

No real ending just another ambiguous ending too often a result of writers enamored with their own cleverness. If it's your story, you should finish it. Every beginning in life has a ending unless you're into infinite parallel alternative universes.",1330646400,6,1076,5.113636363636363
5011599,5,B006OV7RQ4,"I remember back when this little indie was coming out of Sundance with all that buzz and promise and everyone (including myself) was convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was going to ride her buzz all the way to an Oscar nomination.  Then, for some weird reason, it just disappeared.  Olsen picked up a few sporadic mentions (the NBR breakthrough win and a BFCA nomination) but ultimately, Rooney Mara nabbed the `hot young thing' attention from Olsen and took the Oscar nomination from her.  It was perplexing to me, considering all the attention she received coming out of Sundance and the film's thematic elements.  Still, I had yet to see the film and so my opinion was solely based on word of mouth and presumed expectations.

I'm speechless at her Oscar miss, now that I've actually seen the film.

`Martha Marcy May Marlene', expertly conceived, flawlessly edited and beautifully acted, tells the story of a young woman named Martha who gets inducted into a cult, dons the name Marcy May and disappears for two years only to resurface into the lives of her sister and her sister's new husband.  She is close-mouthed about her time spent in the cult and her memories haunt her movements as she fears they will soon come after her.  Martha tries to find her place back in the real world, but her mind and her thought process has been so corroded that she blurs the lines between real life and the life she was taught to the point where everything becomes a strain.

Hands down, Elizabeth Olsen delivers one so the best performances of the year.  She is outstanding here.  Her naturalness in front of the camera is expertly played against the apparent awkwardness of her situation.  The way her eyes betray her own insecurities and the way she imbues honesty into her most complicated scenes.  She's just brilliant here.

The atmosphere created in this film really takes it that extra mile.  It is a thriller of sorts, playing heavily on the fearful tones accompanied by the idea of a cult survivor, but it balances those tones beautifully behind the mask of redemptive situations.  This is the story of a lost young woman trying to be found.  The thing is, she was lost long before she joined the cult and so there really is nowhere to be found since leaving the cult wasn't the ultimate solution.  Sean Durkin's beautifully crafts this character study with so much care and delicacy.  It moves, purposefully, at a slower pace so as to soak in that feeling of unsteadiness.  Watching Martha's life interweave with the life of Marcy May is organic and completely overtaking.

I'm baffled that half these reviews are negative.",1330646400,8,2623,4.771618625277162

5011602,3,B006OV7RQ4,"First: Elizabeth Olsen is incredible in the title role. Incredible.

That being said, the movie was only okay for me. It started out good. The whole cult scene is amazing. Her running away. Calling her sister. Everything. But then, it just kept going on in the same vein. No growth or change for the characters. The biggest change is that the creepy brother-in-law (what was up with him getting all touchy feely on the boat, both times?)got creepier. The sister got a little bitchier. The main character didn't change much in the present parts of the story. You could definitely see her change from getting into the cult until present time. But in the present day portion of the story, not so much. And then there was an ending that was just too ambiguous. It was as if just as the story was starting to go somewhere, the credits started to roll and you're left sitting there going. . .huh?

This isn't a hopeful movie. It's very bleak, which isn't bad, but I think you should be aware of it. There is no happy ending, or any real ending at all. You'll be left feeling like the main character is just going to go on forever like she is. Or maybe go backward. I'd love to see a sequel and know how she pulls herself out of her post traumatic stress. The acting and the pacing are awesome, the story needs some work.",1330473600,12,1314,4.403292181069959
5011603,4,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha, the star of the movie, is a lost soul.  Gets into a cult, which are abusive by nature and can't handle the communal arrangements. She, called Marcy May in the cult, like most everyone wants something of her own but the leader spreads himself around.  But again, she was lost long before she got there. It is those kind aimless people, I guess, that join these cults. They find leaders that feed them emotional crumbs, something they have never found before. They never belonged to anything, don't care about much and don't know how to survive on their own. Then they get deep into the cult and the ugly stuff shows up - like murder.

The Marcy's of the world cannot fit into normal society - they don't know the rules, simple things like not climbing on the kitchen table or wearing swimming suits. Unfortunately, not much means anything to them except some tiny little corner to crawl into for some comfort.  She will probably never be OK. With therapy, she might someday pretend to be normal most of the time. Something happened in her childhood to alienate her from normal behavior.

Conclusion: the actress, Elizabeth Olsen, portrays the role of Martha Marcy May Marlene well.  It is a good production and the movie is cast well. It borders on not being entertaining while engrossing at the same time until the end when we realize nothing will change with our heroine. It is a dark story with little joy and even less hope, leaving a bleak taste of life. All said, this is the story the director wanted to tell and he did so successfully. It just wasn't a lot of fun and even less of everything for Martha.",1330473600,,1618,4.562068965517241
5011604,4,B006OV7RQ4,"By Jim Clark publisher of The Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Martha, Marcy, May, Marlene is a great little movie. The ending, however, was one of those ""let the audience decide how it should end."" It needed a climax, one from the writers.
Our story begins with Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) running away from a cult led by Patrick (John Hawkes).
She calls her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and Martha moves in with her sister and brother-in-law (Hugh Dancy).
The movie slides back and forth, between commune days to present. Martha is unraveling and we see why.
Patrick has the look of a young Manson and also plays guitar and writes songs. Charlie actually met Dennis Wilson, a founding member and drummer of The Beach Boys. Charlie has actually had songs covered by Guns N' Roses, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson.
Patrick basically runs a self-sufficient farm where the women become sex slaves as well as workers. He is charming when he needs to be and rough as nails when crossed.
Martha keeps having flashbacks, won't let her sister know what happened to her so we, as viewers, are brought into this isolated lake house -- with the creepy feeling that Patrick and his true believers could break in any time to take back their Marlene. ""Marlene"" is the name that all the cult's women are required to use when answering the compound's telephone (as explicated in the long list of instructions that are visibly written on the wall next to the telephone).
This is a well made psychological thriller.",1330473600,2,1493,4.764478764478764
5011605,5,B006OV7RQ4,"Since I started reviewing a year ago, I have made it my mission to only review slasher films. I mean my name is Slasher Studios after all and if I started to review other horror films, I might lose my focus. Well, today I am about to break that rule. Today I am reviewing what I believe to be the best film of 2011. It is neither a slasher film nor is it a traditional horror film but it is a film that will stay with you long after many films have come and gone. The movie in question? The beautifully hypnotic ""Martha Mercy May Marlene.""

The film begins with the self destructive Martha (in a brilliant, one-of-a-kind performance by the beautiful Elisabeth Olsen) has run away from an abusive hippie-like cult where she was living as Marcy May for two years. She turns to her sister (nicely played in an understated performance by the always great Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law who take her in and want to help her. The problem is Martha is having a hard time separating dreams from reality and when haunting memories of her past keep resurfacing, she may need more help than anyone is able to give her.

I try to go into as much detail as possible when I am doing my plot summaries but this is the rare case when I honestly believe that less is indeed more. This is exactly the type of movie where you will get everything that you put into it. Want a Hollywood type thriller in which all the plot threads are nicely tied up at the end? This is not the movie for you. All I can say is that the harsh realities of this film combined with some of the most lush and lurid cinematography add up to a film that I won't soon forget. The fact that Elisabeth Olsen wasn't nominated by the Academy this year is one of the grossest oversights in modern day cinema. There is power here.

If it wasn't for all the flashbacks the viewer would feel as if they were watching someone take a nap. None of the main characters has any arc or is changed by the circumstances. On top of that, the movie comes to an abrupt end just as you are expecting some kind of interesting plot development, ok any plot development. I'm fine with movies that leave you thinking, but this one leaves you thinking, ""Where's the movie?""

Elizabeth Olsen would have received an Oscar nomination in a just world, but since this movie wasn't touched by Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg and didn't have a Holocaust/Gender-Bending/Period-Piece theme, it apparently wasn't worthy Oscar-Bait and she was snubbed.

This movie is disturbing on many levels, but the acting and plot and directing and cinematography are arresting and irresistible.  The movie is provocative in so many ways and it is impossible not to become completely absorbed.  I do not know whether to view this movie as a cautionary tale or ""thriller"" as the Amazon description stated, but it is a psychological study and once seen, never forgotten.  It is a violent movie with rape and bloodshed and if you do not like shock value sex scenes then this movie is not for you.  This movie, along with the film Melancholia starring Kirsten Dunst who is back after a long reprieve, are two of the best movies of the year, period.",1330128000,3,767,4.686567164179104
5011620,3,B006OV7RQ4,"Good acting. I basically liked the plot.  A girl, Martha Marcy Mae Marleen, played by Elizabeth Olsen escapes from a cult and it's charasmatic, manipulative and evil leader. There were some interesting parallels between the Manson Family and the cult in this movie.  She gets help from her sister and her husband, but is struggling with the adjustment to a more normal life and there is a dark secret. Martha's life with the cult and her time with her sister is presented as a parallel, switching back and forth between the two. It seems to be universally agreed that Elisabeth Olsen is excellent and John Hawkes makes a fine cult leader and psychopath. For me, the pacing was slow, but I'm kind of a fidgety person anyway. Also, this is not a movie for those that like a neat wrap up. The movie culls a lot of anticipation, but may leave you feeling unsatisfied.",1330041600,3,863,4.597402597402597

And the murder, that might explain such a ridiculous plot, appears so late in the plot line that it appears completely contrived by a sleepy headed script editor. Even so, no joy in the ending. Just a big ? Don't waste your time!

The author should have added another 5-10 minutes to explain how the back-hills cult might actually have been tech-savy enough to pull this off. But if Patrick were that smart she never would have gotten away to begin with. She'd be dead, too.

Seriously, its billed as a psychological thriller. 40 minutes in. No thriller, but definitely some psychological. 80 minutes in, still no thriller. By 92 minutes in, it starts to get a little thriller but mostly everyone who is looking forward to a thriller is asleep. If there had been an ending.

5011623,5,B006OV7RQ4,"I am not a clinician, although from my viewing of this film it exhibited so many elements of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resulting from what happens to a person who has suffered traumatic events. Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) exhibits many of the symptoms; flashbacks, dissociative states of mind and patterns, inappropriate behavior, paranoia, emotional blunting, etc. after she was no longer held against her will in a religious cult. The content during her life within this cult is quite shocking for the viewer, at least, it was for me.  This most 'probably' happened brought on through Martha's life within the cult where she was shocked innumerable times.  It also may have begun earlier in her life, although from what is depicted, it arguably became full-blown and chronic while there.

Martha is renamed ""Marcy May"" upon her arrival with new friend Zoe (Louisa Krause). Patrick (John Hawkes) heads-up this communal cult and is overly quick to take over the new Marcy May after his renaming of  her.  They are located in the Catskill Mountain area in a very dense wooded area.  As is typical with many cults, the women remain subservient to the men and are made to have sex with Patrick. In this particular cult, the women are made available to the other male members also.  Patrick is quite a haunting persona with a likeness to another cult leader of repugnant reputation. The activities and violence of this group are also reminiscent of that horrific sect'.  It  provoked those heart pounding memories for me while frightening me all the more.

Martha is able to escape into the trees for her cover during the early morning hours, then taking off and running for her life.  She begins to be chased by a fellow member, although eventually gets herself through the woods and into a small town. Finding a pay phone as quickly as possible, Martha calls her sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson).  She is directly picked up and drastically tries to identify where she even is.  Lucy finds her sister then brings Martha to her home that she shares with husband Ted (Hugh Dancy).  This is where the movie quickly gains pace and Martha begins to sharply unravel.  She is confused and caught between her past life in the cult commune and the present with her family.  Displaying inappropriate behavior while Lucy constantly tries, mainly through questioning, to find out what has happened to her sister.  The obviously normal actions of Lucy towards Martha is called, ""secondary wounding"".  This causes Martha to have to relive the trauma she has been through while remaining in a huge amount of stress, bewilderment, and obvious confusion.  Martha must, somehow, make the transition from her past into the present life in which she is living now.

This film is written and directed by first-timer Sean Durkin who did an amazing job with the handling of these character portrayals.  Elizabeth Olsen is nothing short of amazing in the role of Martha, Marcy May, Marlene along with an equally inerrant John Hawkes as Patrick.  The movie's soundtrack lays out so much suspense, causing indwelling stress while underscoring these events.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  For me, this is a  suspenseful film and a hauntingly memorable portrayal of the mental anguish suffered from extreme and repeated trauma.",1330041600,14,3311,4.9655172413793105
5011624,5,B006OV7RQ4,"It is difficult to watch this completely absorbing film MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE without knowing something about the creator Sean Durkin.  Even though he is still very young he presents evidence of an enormous talent. He has been quoted else where with the following statements: ``I think as a child I was really afraid of groups that conformed. Cults were really an example of that. I'm attracted to fear. I'm attracted to movies that scare you. I knew I would just end up working in that realm.' 'How can you make a movie about getting out of a cult if you've never gotten out of a cult?' Because movies are made by people who don't have to go through things. You have to understand that. I have to understand, emotionally and psychologically, what she went through. And I did that, then I tried to be true to that when I was making the movie. To understand sisters, I need to understand family relationships. I don't think of it in terms of male-female or having to live through it.

With that information the plot line of this film seems more accessible, though it is a film that will appeal to a somewhat limited audience. It is an engrossing dissection of the mind of a girl whose life is so fractured that she escapes `ordinary life' to join a cult living on a farm where all of the members work and all are directed by the mindset of a quietly deranged man.

Martha (Elizabeth Olsen in a knockout performance) has been living with a `family' headed by the charismatic, dark Patrick (John Hawkes) who has renamed her Marcy May.  Together with Zoe (Louisa Krause), Katie (Mary Dizia), Sarah (Julia Garner) - each of whom is bedded by Patrick in a ceremony of sorts - and with the male members of the family Max (Christopher Abbot) and Watts (Brady Corbett). When we first meet Marlene she is leaving the family, headed for sanctuary with her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law Ted (Hugh Dancy) - two successful young people who are part of the `establishment'. Martha attempts to find peace with Lucy and Ted, but her nightmares and haunting paranoia make her appear like a severely mentally injured girl: the reasons for her behavior we discover through a series of playbacks of her strange and ultimately criminal life with the family.  Rather than bringing resolution to the film's story writer/director Durkin leaves Martha (now in her new role as Marlene) at a juncture where we the audience must decide the ending. It is this slowing unwinding of a girl's mind as displayed in the relationship with her nurturing but confused sister that makes one of the most thrilling psychological dramas in years.

Even though the film as we watch it seems to be the career making performance of Elizabeth Olsen it is far more staggering a `first outing' for Sean Durkin.  From the setting in the Catskills and in Connecticut to the finely shaped performances by Sarah Paulson, Hugh Dancy, John Hawkes, Brady Corbett, and literally every member of this cast, this is one of the finest films of the year.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 12",1329955200,11,3060,4.715355805243446
5011625,3,B006OV7RQ4,"I heard a lot of things about Elizabeth Olsen's debut role in MMMM. I understand that Martha (Olsen) was a frightened, broken young woman, but at times I didn't feel very connected to her as a viewer. As viewers, we are not supposed to feel connected or close to Martha. Olsen is fantastic at portraying the lead character. The film is unsettling, and captivating as Martha continues to unravel and show the affects of the cult in her present life. Most of the movie was slow, and it shifted between past and present, both were features that I liked. Elizabeth's performance is pretty remarkable. She has the talent to carry the entire film and the cinematography is beautiful.  My only disappointment with the movie overall was that it felt like something was missing. The acting is excellent. Olsen is hands-down the best part of the movie.  However, given the film's subject matter, it's understandable that Martha's past, present, or future are not clear. 3.5 stars.",1329868800,2,970,4.872727272727273

That seemed to be one of the big takeaways from last year's Martha Marcy May Marlene, which has already won several awards from critics societies and is currently nominated for four Indie Spirit awards. But Elizabeth Olsen wasn't the only one making an impressive first impression; the haunting psychodrama about a young woman who escapes a cult and attempts to piece her life back together in the aftermath is also the debut of writer-director Sean Durkin. Cutting seamlessly between the past and present, Durkin brings the viewer into his heroine's crippling paranoia, which grows increasingly worse until it becomes unclear what reality is and what her mind has fabricated. Martha Marcy May Marlene is an effective thriller that creeps up on you and stays with you for days.",1329782400,3,869,5.041666666666667
5011628,4,B006OV7RQ4,"MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is the story of a young woman who is lured into a cult, only to eventually become disillusioned and flee to the real world, where she seeks refuge with her sister.  The film is told in a series of alternating flashbacks, which takes some adjusting to; at times, these subtle cutaways work very well, flowing seamlessly together; at other times, they create a jilted, jumbled film where we're never quite sure where we are (and not in the good way).

What anchors the film are its performances: natural, organic, almost flawless.  The film is situated firmly on the shoulders of Elizabeth Olsen (the Olsen sister you should pay attention to).  She gives a layered, haunting performance; it's truly hard to take your eyes off her, especially as her character tries to adjust to ""normal"" society.  The other half of the equation is Patrick, the cult leader who seduces Martha.  John Hawkes gives a collected, simmering performance; beneath his benevolent smile beats the heart of a true Manson, and you're never sure whether or not that figure will burst through (or if he's even there at all).

Director Sean Durkin clearly has a strong sense of framing a scene (there are a lot of extended shots, and the type of Steadicam shots that actually create tension and intimacy, rather than dissipate it).  His screenplay is equally adept; this is truly a well-made film, hindered only by its own real lack of narrative structure.  This is only a minor inconvenience, however; as a whole, MARTHA MACY MAY MARLENE is a beautiful, often uncomfortable, emotionally provocative film.",1329782400,5,1596,4.925373134328358

5011630,5,B006OV7RQ4,"Sean Durkin's film debut, `Martha Marcy May Marlene', was a hit with the indie crowd at Sundance this year, winning the U.S. Director's Award for Best Drama. After much acclaim in the film festival circuit, `Martha Marcy May Marlene' has been given a wide release. It is also one of the best films of the year.

The story focuses on a young girl named Martha, who escapes from a manipulative, abusive cult in the Catskill Mountains. Her estranged older sister picks her up at a gas station three hours away from the location of the aforementioned cult, and insists that Martha stay with she and her husband. All the while, Martha begins to unravel emotionally, as well as psychologically. The film blends past with present, bending the narrative so that you are seeing the world through Martha's eyes in all of its twisted confusion. While her sister and her brother-in-law desperately try to unveil her many secrets, Martha is haunted by a lingering sense of paranoia, as she fears the ""family"" from which she escaped may come back for her any minute.

This is not an easy film to watch. The scenes of emotional abuse and brainwashing are powerfully raw. However, this film attempts to bring to the surface issues which are shockingly relevant.  The film is anchored by two excellent performances by Elizabeth Olsen as Martha and John Hawkes as cult leader, Patrick. Sean Durkin is a filmmaker to watch. This is an extraordinarily strong debut.",1329523200,8,1445,4.842105263157895
5011631,5,B006OV7RQ4,"A young woman called Marcy May (played by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen, remember her name) flees from an abusive cult and calls her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) to pick her up. Her sister, who calls her Martha, hasn't seen her in over a year and finds Martha deliberately vague about where she has been. Lucy brings her to the large home she shares with her husband Ted (Hugh Dancy) and Martha's time in the cult is revealed through intercut flashbacks. Branded Marcy May by Patrick (John Hawkes), the charismatic leader, the commune consists of few men and many women, most from troubled backgrounds. The women are assigned individual duties, but the one they all share is to sleep with Patrick. The film wisely avoids giving too many details about the cult itself and what its basis is, but fills in all the necessary details otherwise.

This 2011 indie thriller marks the debut of writer/director Sean Durkin who has fashioned a quiet, powerful psychological drama that introduces the world to a terrific new actress. Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of two very famous twins, turns in a bold, Oscar-caliber piece of acting that allows her to successfully break from the stigma of having world-famous siblings. She's a remarkable talent and establishes her own niche as an actress, becoming a star on her own terms. The film is strong on its own merits, but, once you've seen it, it's hard to forget Olsen and even easier to forget her famous sisters.

This is a terrific debut for Durkin. Labeled as a thriller, it moves in a low-key fashion that doesn't go for easy ""thrills"" and instead opts for a deeply unsettling tone. The story, which uses shifting timelines in an intentionally disorienting way, never clues you in to where it's heading, but holds your attention rapt getting there. Juxtaposing this with the somber mood and static cinematography, Martha Marcy May Marlene is riveting.

Fresh off an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes is quietly sinister as Patrick. Rather than playing the cult leader as flamboyant or inherently crazy, Hawkes plays him as a soft-spoken, gentle figure and comes off as so creepy without ever trying. Physically, it's not a radical departure from his powerful, Oscar-nominated role as Teardrop in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B003EYVXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>&nbsp;but the performances are wildly different. Hawkes has been active for a long time, but it's been a mesmerizing ride watching him grow into his own as an actor, tackling such varied roles across different genres. He proves with each new performance to have an incredible amount of range and I believe his best work may still be ahead of him. With this and Winter's Bone he's showing himself as a force to be reckoned with. Choosing subtlety over bravura, rarely breaking from the soft-spoken creature he establishes, it's triumphant how his characterization of Patrick convincingly allows his presence to hang over the movie in the same way it hangs over Martha. Like Olsen, his performance is Oscar-caliber but perhaps too subtle to capture the eye of Academy voters.

This brings me back to Elizabeth Olsen. A beautiful woman in a strangely unique way, she has a very child-like look that betrays the amount of emotion she's capable of conveying. It probably helps the quality of her performance, making it so much more unexpected. She really plays this role beautifully and bravely where another actress in her position could've unwisely taken an easy route and capitalized on her name rather than her talent. It appears that Olsen has honed her craft and waited for the right opportunity to strike. Considering she gives one of the most depressing, daring, and impressive performances of 2011, she has made the right decision. This is an actress going places.

Martha Marcy May Marlene is less a thriller than a riveting, psychological portrait. It's distinctly separate from a Hollywood film, but too sophisticated for the indie label. Durkin's film is brave and unflinching, a film that could have only been made on the indie circuit. This is not because of the film's controversial elements, which aren't too graphic, but the way he unwaveringly looks at the effect the cult has had on Martha and refuses to betray the very realistic scenario. The film's final shot is abrupt and ambiguous, but far from anticlimactic. An obvious metaphor, it brings just the right amount of closure that can be afforded to this story and character. An obvious metaphor, yes, but certainly not an ineffective one. This shot is frightening and unforgettable; a brave, sad ending to the film. It's so deceptively simple, yet towering in its impact. I know this may give the impression that the film ends violently, but it creates more paranoia with a simple, unmoving shot than anything horrific could have. Martha Marcy May Marlene is a late inclusion to my top ten list and is one of the best films of 2011, with a star-making performance by a most unexpected actress.

5011632,5,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Marcy May Marlene marks the debut of two talents, the director, Sean Durkin, and the actress, Elizabeth Olsen. Both actor and director show a kind of assured performance that seems relegated to those who are either new to a scene, when talent has been building up for some time and only now has had a chance to unveil itself, or to older creative types, who have enough success behind them that they no longer fear failure (the in-between is usually the tricky part). Elizabeth Olsen (and here I'm required to tell you that she is the younger sister to the famed Full House Olsen twins) plays Martha, a girl who has spent an indeterminate amount of time in a cult hidden away in upstate New York. She eventually flees the confines of the commune and is taken in by her sister and brother-in-law who own a spacious lake house in Connecticut.

From here the film is divided into two narratives, one chronicling Martha's ordeal in the Manson-like collective and the other detailing her return to polite society at her sister's place. We learn from the former narrative that the cult takes in runaways and is overseen by a charismatic leader, Patrick, played by John Hawkes. While the cult members bandy about pseudo-New Wave jargon, we hear talk of energies, the specific philosophy of the cult remains vague. As one might expect, Patrick has intimate access to most of the women, as do the other men on the compound, to varying degrees. The cult members share duties taking care of children and tending to a garden, and they hope one day to go fully off the grid.

The second narrative follows Martha as she attempts to reconnect with her sister Lucy and return to normalcy. For Martha, the lake house is an even more foreign world than the cult. She still plays by the rules set up for her by Patrick. She goes skinny dipping in the middle of the day. And when she feels lonely in her bedroom, she has no qualms about lying down on the foot of Lucy's bed, even if her sister is in mid-coitus. As Martha's actions become increasingly bizarre, her brother-in-law puts more pressure on Lucy to hand her sister over to an institution. As we learn what Martha has gone through, it becomes more and more difficult to sympathize with Lucy and her husband's frustrations. But while Lucy's husband, Ted, often comes off as a prick (tellingly, he has a well enunciated British accent), it is hard to blame Lucy's reticence to take on the responsibility of handling Martha on her own.

Even though the two narratives are chronologically back to back--the story of Martha's time in the cult followed by her time with her sister--neither is prized over the other. In fact, it is difficult for me to describe events that occur at the compound as flashbacks because for Martha these events do not exist in the past. She carries the trauma with her. Durkin, the director, excises most establishing shots from the movie, making it difficult to tell whether the next scene begins at the lake house or the compound. The title of the film is a series of names the main character goes by. Her birth name is obviously Martha. She is given the name Marcy May by Patrick when she joins the cult. And Marlene is a communal name used by all the women in the cult to answer the phone. Martha is a woman who has been stripped of her ego and exists in the liminal space between ""is"" and ""was.""

Elizabeth Olsen does a fantastic job of portraying a woman who has undergone immense pain. While this trauma does not always manifest itself, it always lingers underneath the surface of her performance. Likewise, Durkin imbues even the most mundane scenes with a sense of tension. It is far, far too early to tell where either Olsen or Durkin's career will go at this point, but I would be interested in seeing the two work together again. Regardless, I have a feeling plenty more will come from both of these talents.",1326585600,95,3890,4.608946608946609

Elizabeth Olsen gives an amazing performance and in one movie breaks out of her sisters' shadows in a big way and to me shows something they never have shown...talent.

5011634,5,B006OV7RQ4,"Martha Marcy May Marlene, or ""M4"" as I like to call it is one of the best films I've seen this year(I thought the films this year were pretty poor but still)The film follows Martha(Elizibeth Olson) as she desperately makes her escape from a secluded farm in up state New York. She escapes to a nearby town but she's soon confronted by one of her fellow ""community members"" from the farm. They share the film's first uncomfortable moment while they eat lunch at the local diner. Martha makes a move for the diner door but he grabs her arm coldly saying ""what's the matter? you're shake'n"" then proceeds to leave Martha to her own devices. She's scared and confused but is able to regain her composure enough to call her older sister Lucy(Sarah Paulson).It seems that Martha has being missing for sometime and Lucy is all that remains of her estranged family. Once Martha is reunited with her sister, she attempts to rejoin normal society. Lucy does her best to look after her sister but the mental scars that Martha bares soon become apparent.

  As the film progress we get a glimpse into what transpired at the farm. Director T. Sean Durkin choose to hop back and forth from the present to the past to drive the film. Sometimes this approach causes a film to become unfocused or details get muddled but Durkin executes it perfectly. He's slow and methodological with his approach but the slow pace of the film really adds an element of tension that I haven't felt while watching a film for sometime. I found myself clenching my jaw as if watching a speeding car bowling towards an unsuspecting pedestrian.

  Aside from superb directing, M4 is supported by fantastic acting. Elizibeth Olsen puts in a strong lead performance as the terrified/mentally ill Martha. She's beautiful and eloquent but her eyes show a deep sadness and unexpressed terror. Sarah Paulson has a solid performance as the well meaning, but overwhelmed and frightened Lucy and John Hawkes channels his inner Charles Manson as the charismatic cult leader.

5011636,3,B006OV7RQ4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Martha Marcy May Marlene is by newcomer director, Sean Durkin, who admitted during an interview that he has always been fascinated by Charles Manson and his followers, and that's why he decided to fashion his own story about a young woman who flees a fictional, upstate New York cult. Since I had a hard time believing in quite a bit of Durkin's tale, I found myself emotionally detached from his sketchy characters; ultimately, however, I found a good part of the film to be entertaining--'good, clean, creepy fun', if you will.

  The protagonist is Martha, played with a nice intensity by the sister of the Olsen twins, Elizabeth Olsen. When we first meet Martha, she's on the phone with her older sister, Lucy, who she hasn't talked to in two years. It seems that Martha wants out of an abusive cult who she's been living with on a run-down farm. Lucy picks Martha up and brings her to a summer house in Connecticut where we're also introduced to Lucy's husband, Ted, a rather cold architect, who hails from Britain.

  The film keeps flipping back and forth between the present time at the summer house and flashbacks to Martha's time as a member of the unnamed cult. In the present, Martha's behavior slowly becomes more and more weird. For example, she takes off her clothes to go swimming in full view of both her sister and brother-in-law and later crawls into their bed as the two are engaged in steamy lovemaking. Those red flags aren't enough for Lucy to get some professional help for her sister and we must wait until three quarters into the film when Martha has a complete meltdown during a party Lucy is throwing at the house, before her sister finally concludes that Martha needs to be in a psychiatric facility. It's also interesting that Lucy has no friends that she consults with about Martha and appears to rely completely on Ted, her wholly unsympathetic husband. I suppose there are some cold fish like Ted who believe in 'tough love' but at least wouldn't there have been speculation on both the sister and brother-in-law's part EARLIER in the film, that Martha may have been in a cult and needed some kind of professional help?

  Until the unconvincing denouement, Durkin serves up a generic, cookie cutter cult, for our enjoyment. Like the Manson family, the majority of the participants are women who are mesmerized by a Svengali-like cult leader, Patrick (played by John Hawkes, who also had a similar role as the menacing, creepy uncle 'Teardrop' in 'Winter's Bone'). Everything you would expect to happen to the female followers in the cult, does. Initially, they're fed pills so they'll be half-asleep when they're led into Patrick's bedroom, where they're raped. Later, after being brainwashed, they appear to willingly engage in sex with the male 'leaders'. There's other creepy stuff including a scene where a cat is killed while the women are engaging in target practice with guns in the forest. It would have been more compelling if the cult members' personalities had been more fleshed out, but Durkin seems content to serve up the basics.

  The story goes in the wrong direction when Durkin suddenly turns his rather docile cult into a bunch of Manson-like murderers. Initially, the cult is seen committing burglaries in expensive homes, presumably to keep the group financially afloat. But when the cult members are surprised by a homeowner they didn't anticipate being there during one of these burglaries, one of the female crazies, stabs him to death. The main thing about these cults is that they're quite secretive and don't like outsiders. Committing a murder is the last thing a cult leader would encourage, unless you're a borderline schizophrenic like Manson. Otherwise, the whole idea is to make sure your group doesn't call attention to itself. It's interesting that no police investigation is depicted following the stabbing in the home. Of course, in reality, there would have been one, and indubitably your dirty-looking cultists would probably have ended up as number one suspects.

  Durkin was quoted as saying that he left the film's ending intentionally ambiguous. A friend of mine who saw the film with me, insisted that Martha, her sister and brother-in-law were dead meat: convinced that one of the cult members was following them in his car while Martha was being driven to the psychiatric facility, and just on the verge of doing them in. I prefer to believe in the more likely scenario, that what Martha saw were actually hallucinations, part of the paranoid frame of mind she was in (that includes the man she saw sitting on the rocks while she was swimming in the lake). One additional thought did come to mind: if the cult member actually succeeded in hunting down Martha and family, the police would have little trouble in drawing a connection between the two, since a cult member did return Martha's call to the summer house, which could have been easily traced.

  Is Durkin morally repulsed by the machinations of these cultists or is he titillated by all the sexual hi-jinx? The fixation on Ms. Olsen's breasts, throughout the film, might suggest the latter. The more likely interpretation is Durkin has mixed feelings about his subject. After all, Lucy and Ted hardly come off as very sympathetic (in other words, Mother Theresas they are not!).

  I hardly wish to rain on the parade of a first-time director, so let us acknowledge that Martha Marcy May Marlene does manage to entertain, despite a few unpleasant (and sometimes implausible) twists and turns. And what about the neat title? For those who missed it, 'Martha' is the protagonist's real name, 'Marcy May' is Svengali Patrick's pet name for her and 'Marlene' is the pseudonym, given by each female cult member, whenever they answer the phone. Cult members sure don't have it easy!",1323475200,7,5862,4.892028254288597
5011637,4,B006OV7RQ4,"The title character is a cult follower of a charismatic leader. One day she leaves the cult and ends up staying with her sister and husband.  They are about as opposite from cult devotees as it would be possible to be.  They are almost entirely consumed with setting up house, having a baby and so forth.  However, they are ""all there"" mentally which cannot be said for our title character.

Elizabeth Olsen plays that title role very well and John Hawkens as the cult leader and Hugh Dancy as her brother in law are also really good. MMMM will leave you wondering exactly what is wrong with her.  There is one thing I can be sure of: she has a pronounced lack of affect and I suspect she's always had that lack. She may also be a schizophrenic or perhaps she's having hallucinations from past drug usage or PTSD. That she needs a mental hospital is glaringly apparent as the story goes on.

She also has a startling amount of cruelty in her as she pronounces to her sister, ""You'll make a terrible parent,"" knowing that her sister is trying to get pregnant.  I would have been tempted to say back, ""Well at least I won't be a vacant, washed out mess of one."" The sister is less cruel though than the protagonist.

This cult follower is not a sympathetic figure.  I would imagine in real life most of them are not. She has nothing to give anyone else other than the languorous commitment she had to her cult leader.

The only problem with this film is that there is no one you come to care about at all.  I never empathized with a single character in it because I did not like a single character in it.  This does not mean, however, that it did not do well what it set out to do.",1322611200,5,1679,4.295238095238095

8502399,2,B006OV7RQ4,"Spoiler alert...
So, to be fair, I was expecting a horror movie and this is billed as a drama.  However, I didn't like it as a drama either. It popped up on my recommendation list, and the trailer seemed to indicate that there would be, at least, a modicum of tension.  Not only was there no tension, the director seems to have gone to great lengths to make sure there was also no drama.  I'm not sure why we're supposed to be so impressed by the main actress.  She just walks around looking vacant, with very little to say.  The story features the most feeble minded woman that ever walked on the planet.  After living in a commune for two years she seems to have completely lost the memory of how to live in a normal household.  A feral child raised by wolves probably has a better idea of modern life than the main character. That would make sense if she had entered the commune under the age of five, but she was a full grown adult.  At one point she apparently even forgot that the commune had some sort of caller id, as she calls the commune, then seems surprised when they apparently start calling her back.  The actress attempts to convey some sort of emotion in response to this development:  anxiety, fear, anger.  It's anybody's guess, but it's not a positive emotion.  Nevertheless, she neglects to warn her family about their possibly impending doom.  She simply suffers a couple of anxiety attacks and carries on being vapid.  In the end we're left with the vague idea that some commune members might possibly be following them down the road, but it may just be a rude driver.  I suppose the lack of conclusion was meant to be artistic, but I just found it annoying.",1523750400,,1680,4.462295081967213

The ""suspense"" is actually you trying to figure out the story when there is no story.  And the ending is a big insult to the audience and a betrayal of the viewer's trust.
