2115202,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I knew from previews I had seen that ""Arrested Development"" was not your average sitcom. And it's not. It's much wittier, much smarter and much funnier. It's the freshest show on network television in recent memory. I have the feeling the actors on this show get it. They get what is trying to be accomplished and it shows. I can't wait for the DVD.",1092096000,11,349,4.46875
2115203,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Fox finally gets it right for the first time in years and renews a show that deserves all the support it can get.  This show can be considered an acquired taste initially, but one could say the same for other classic shows such as Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm.  The pacing and narrative are different from what is typically served up on TV, so it may take some time to adjust to the quirkiness of the show...let it sneak up on you as the episodes progress, and you will be genuinely surprised at how clever and laugh-out-loud funny this show truly is.  I just wish Jason Bateman had made the cut for a Best Comedic Actor Emmy, as his work is surprisingly excellent and crucial towards grounding the rest of the loopy family members (all of them great as well) in something resembling reality, unlike the Jack & Karen slapstick nonsense in Will & Grace.  Great stuff!",1091491200,56,871,4.528662420382165
2115204,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I must apologize. This is more of a plea, than it is a review.  Yes, AD is a fine show.  However, please join my growing crusade (me and the guy who posted the second review above me) to encourage Tobias to reobtain his medical license.  Here's the scoop: at a crab dinner last year, i swallowed what I thought were crab testicles.  As a result of a severely developed gag-reflex, I choked on the balls, as a sort of defense mechanism.  And then came Tobias.  It was like a scene from a movie.  He came to my rescue and promptly removed his pants, exposing his denim cutoffs.  With his Docker brand khakis, Dr. Funke, wrapped the legs around my mid-section and squeezed tightly, thus causing the crab balls (which were later discovered to be deep-fried crab cakes) to lunge from my lungs and onto my date's lap.  While my date was disgusted and left the table, I spent the rest of a beautiful evening with Dr. Funke.  I don't know what Lindsey has done to Tobias, but he needs to refocus his career on medicine and then delve into acting, after his hands no longer posess that 'magical touch.'  Dr. Funke, please come back,

2115205,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This series is genuinely very funny. The writing is better than a series should have, all of the actors have great comedic timing (especially a magician named GOB), and it has all sorts of humor: from simple Byron quirkiness to quirky and original Tobias-ness. In the first season it has had just about the entire cast of Mr. Show: a great underground HBO alternative comedy cult hit. AD has been funny since the first episode and has not gotten any unfunnier throughout all 22 episodes herein contained. It is required viewing for everyone in the world.

Sincerely,

2115206,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This show is what television comedy has been trying to do for the past 5 years.  The aim to drop the laugh track and make it noticable was a direct hit.  Watch the characters kinks especially gob's and busty's.  You will not find it hard watching it all the way through.

2115207,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the one
sane one trying to hold things together.

Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to do
a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did
they ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""

On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had
to fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever
twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top,
but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodes
like `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the history
of television.",1441324800,,1220,4.9365853658536585

2115218,5,B0002PYS7Y,"There comes along a comedic TV show every now and then that transcends itself.  The writing is spot on.  The humor is hilarious and multi layered.  The cast is superb.  The show literally hits every note and merges into a fantastic mix to create something epic.  And when that happens the idiots at FOX are guaranteed to cancel it!

Ok, so maybe they did a bit better with this show than some of their other decisions.  Like Firefly.  Bet they would like that decision back, but anyways. At least they gave this show 3 seasons!

This show really does hit on all levels.  Its hilarious and heartwarming.  Its laugh out loud funny.  It was top notch all the way.  So why did it fail?
Arrested Development ran into the same problem the excellent show Community has, people don't like clever comedy it seems.  They want dumb comedy that requires no amount of brain power to process.  You don't have to be a genius to enjoy this show.  But you do have to step above the normal comedic drivel that is everywhere these days.  This show is worth checking out.

So many classic scenes this season.  The burning of the banana stand.  Gobs dead bird.  Georges love affair with an ice cream sandwich.
Am I overhyping this?  Not a bit.  So many years after the fact and this is still one of the best comedies that has ever been on television.  Dont believe me?  Buy it and try it.  You won't be disappointed.",1417737600,,1395,4.436507936507937

It could be that I have to let it grow on me or maybe it's just past its prime. I love humor like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld but this one just doesn't seem up to that level. It could be that too many people said how wonderful it is and thus built it up in my mind to an unattainable expectation. That can happen and also can work both ways- when people go on and on about how wonderful a show is and then I watch it expecting greatness I am disappointed but on the flip side if people say they don't like something and so out of curiosity I watch it expecting heinousness I am pleasantly surprised...

Everyone knows, of course, that the essential ingredients for successful TV sitcoms are in the writing, the cast, and the timing of the show's release.  Arrested Development no doubt met both the former criteria; the writing is so clever, so offbeat, and so layered with wonderfully bizarre motifs (chicken dance, Tobias' ambiguous sexuality, George Michael and Maeby's on-again-off-again flirtation) that it begs repeated viewings.  And the cast is absolutely stellar.  Each individual performer is spectacular, but it's the way they riff off of one another that truly creates the show's magic.  The only problem with the show, I suppose, was in its timing.  It was cancelled after only three seasons, which signifies that its handlers didn't know how to market it, or perhaps that most viewers are not interested in TV that requires steadfast attention.

So we are left with 50 or so episodes that are, more or less, representing some of the funniest and best TV moments in the last twenty or thirty years.

2115261,5,B0002PYS7Y,"That 1000+ reviews still average out to a 5 star review on Amazon is all you need to know.
I saw one episode on TV and thought there was something intriguing about it so bought the season 1 box set when it came out.
However many years later this is, I've now seen it all 3 seasons about 4 or 5 times. I put it on my ipod and found that it was able to calm me down or lift my spirits as well as entertain me.
Smart, brilliantly acted and directed, it is without doubt my favourite series of all time closely followed by The Sorpranos, The Wire and Buffy.
When season 3 came out I watched the extras and there's a film about the last day of shooting. When Will Arnett chokes up saying goodbye to the crew, I knew exactly how he felt.
Fox got a hard time on cancelling this one, but by all accounts they stuck with it for at least a season and a half longer than they would normally have done but ultimately, couldn't justify the low ratings. I'm glad they did. Season 3 is probably the funniest. You can't help but wonder what its' trajectory would have been if allowed to continue.

The cancellation is, in a way, when AD gets interesting as a cultural phenomenon. The word of mouth began to spread and new fans continue to find it. This doesn't happen very often with any series, let alone comedy.  The rumoured film would be wonderful to see but then I always simultaneously longed for AND dreaded a Beatles reunion, so perhaps I don't really want them to mess with the legacy of AD either.

The writing, editing and acting are all at the highest level - seriously you need rewatches just to be sure you have all the innuendo and sight gags covered.

Hands down the funniest comedy drama ever. Even if you like Black Adder, Curb, The Office, Father Ted, Fawlty Towers, Seinfeld, Frasier etc I promise you this is the smartest and funniest of them all - it really is.

Reading this back, as someone who used to review things objectively for national papers in the UK, I'm surprised to have written something so subjective, but it's my honest opinion. I wouldn't trust the taste of someone who didn't give this 5 stars.",1309651200,2,2118,4.351898734177215

2115263,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Arrested Development is by far one of the funniest shows out there that not many people have actually seen. The absolute ABSURDITY of it all is just so appealing. Every single member of the family has their own neuroticism that you just can't help but love. But my favorite is Gob - his ""chicken"" dance, emphasizing his points with the movements of his Segway.... classic.

I've had many friends who have resisted this show at first but then became hardcore fans. Just stick with it, the absurdity grows and so does your love for the Bluth family.

2115278,4,B0002PYS7Y,"I really do regret never seeing ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT during its three-season run from 2003-2006, as it is one of the few television comedy programmes I've enjoyed. Its documentary-like storytelling based around a quirky family, where executive George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison and his son Michael (Jason Bateman) must take over the company and shepherd his siblings, with frequent flashbacks makes for comedy that I can best compare to Wes Anderson's film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Royal-Tenenbaums/dp/B0000640VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>. While the writing is at a high level, with complex plotlines and jokes that play themselves out across episodes (or disappear only to return a season later), but the writers also had to work within the constraints of a FOX sitcom, and one of its successes is how cleverly they chafe at their situation. References to sitcom tropes abound, such as a character joining the military, the matriarch adopting a child only to have him quickly disposed of, and dramas of who someone's real father is.

The strong writing couldn't succeed without strong acting. Rarely have I seen a cast so believable as a family, with Bateman as the responsible middle son carrying on a convincing rapport with Will Arnett as his loser elder brother George Oscar ""GOB"" Bluth and Tony Hale as his neurotic younger brother Buster, as well as Portia Rossi as his airhead twin sister Lindsey. I first became familiar with Will Arnett's acting when he played a hyperbolic pervert soon killed by a sex machine on a Human Giant sketch. His part of GOB is considerably more tame, and elicits as much sympathy as laughter. Just as fine as the central parts, however, are the guest parts: Henry Winkler as a seedy lawyer, Amy Poehler as a manic seal trader whom GOB marries on a dare, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a blind attorney.

If you only know this programme from when it was broadcasted, the DVD is still worthwhile, as there's a lot of freeze-frame details that make it all even funnier. That said, the series was funny well beyond season one, and the DVD set of all three seasons goes in some places for little more than this set of season one only.",1255392000,,2254,5.155737704918033

2115281,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Fans of ""Arrested Development"" were disappointed, but in agreeance with Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of said TV show, when it was announced that it would not be returning.  It's not difficult to understand why.  Normally, when shows are cancelled that quickly, it's because they just aren't very good.  This show was intelligent, the plotlines became increasingly hilarious and complicated and the cast was just enjoyable to watch, but Hurwitz wanted to smartly end the show before the quality declined.  He said he would rather disappoint fans with less episodes than crappy ones--an excellent choice.

Ron Howard provides some delightful narration for the show.  Jason Bateman carries the series as Michael Bluth, the son of George Bluth Sr., (Jeffrey Tambor) and Lucille Bluth, (Jessica Walter).  In the first episode, we learn that George, former CEO of the Bluth Company is going to prison for spending the company's money on ""personal expenses"".  Michael, the most stable of the family, is elected as the new head of the company, since his twin sister, Lindsay, (Portia de Rossi), is a spendthrift, his brother, Gob, (Will Arnett), is a failing magician with no sense of responsibility and his younger brother, Buster, (Tony Hale), is a good-for-nothing who is too obsessed with his mother to ever be successful on his own.  Michael also has a son, George Michael, (Michael Cera), who has some problems of his own, since after an accidental kiss with his cousin, Maeby, (Alia Shawkat), he thinks he may be in love with her.  David Cross plays Maeby's father and Lindsay's husband, Tobias, and, although married to Lindsay, his sexuality is constantly disputed in the same way Stewie from Family Guy is accused of being a homosexual.  Soon enough, George Sr. escapes from prison and the family struggles to keep his hideout in the attic, and various other places, a secret.  But more trouble shows up in the form of George Sr.'s identical twin brother, Oscar, (also played by Jeffrey Tambor).

The hijinks and disasters tie in to each other so well in this show.  Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does and doubles it.  Henry Winkler guest stars in quite a few episodes as Barry Zuckercorn, the eccentric family attorney.  As the seasons progress, the guest stars increase, including an appearance by Scott Baio, the replacement family lawyer aptly named Bob Loblaw, (say it quickly).  Charlize Theron guest stars as an MRF, (you'll have to watch the show to find out), with whom Michael falls in love.  Liza Minnelli guest stars as Lucille's rival and, eventually, Buster's girlfriend.  There are plenty of celebrity appearances on the show to help flesh out the eccentricity of the lives of these characters.

From Tobias joining the Blue Man Group and helping out the FBI by accident to the TBA foundation, to Maeby possibly not even being related to George Michael, things just get more and more complicated.  Enter also, Steve Holt, (Justin Grant Wade), who shares his own secret with Gob...and can't help but announce himself by first and last name whenever he enters a room.  Or ""Annyong"", the Korean son Lucille adopts in an effort to make Buster jealous of her ""new son"", only, she doesn't know that ""annyong"" means ""hello"" in Korean.  Or Ann, (Alessandra Toreson), George Michael's girlfriend who is often forgotten or ignored by Michael.

As the show progresses, it keeps its hilarity and gains complication which makes for some excellent television.  Even though it's hard to trust a show if you've never heard of it and it has only three seasons worth of episodes, this is one show that you won't be disappointed in if you give it a few moments of your time.  Certain continuity jokes such as ""I've made a huge mistake"" just get funnier when applied to different contexts.  And this family is so quirky it's hard to relate them to your own family, so you can just enjoy watching this family act out some of the wildest events yet.  And hey, with Richie Cunningham narrating, you can't go wrong!",1251072000,2,4023,4.902511078286558
2115282,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I loved the few episodes of this show that I saw when it originally aired.  The beauty of the DVD series collection is the ability to watch every episode back to back and I love these episodes--so funny!

The regular cast is brilliant: Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Jeffrey Tambor, Portia de Rossi, Michael Cera, David Cross, Tony Hale and all the rest.  So many comedic heavy hitters on one show!! And it never overwhelmed, always funny in a delicate way.  The cameos are well worked into the plot, and they are seamlessly integrated into the cast.  Liza Minnelli is especially hilarious as Lucille #1's rival and Buster's girlfriend.  Also included in this season: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Poehler, Henry Winkler, and Jane Lynch.

This brilliant series about a dysfunctional family falling apart in the midst of corruption, embezzlement, fraud, and some ""light"" treason (yes, ""light"" treason), with only Michael the reliable son to save them from themselves, was cancelled too soon by the short-sighted executives at Fox.

The writing is smart. The setup is intriguing and amusing. Jason Bateman and Michael Cera are appealing. A few of the other characters are fun to watch. But on the whole, I don't enjoy shows where almost none of the characters are appealing personalities and nothing good ever happens. The whole point (at least in the first few episodes) seemed to be that things would go from bad to worse, no one else in the family could be trusted to behave like a rational adult, and poor Michael and/or George Michael would be left holding the bag, every time. I don't get that much enjoyment from watching other people's misery, even if it's meant to be humorous.",1242345600,2,894,4.451219512195122
2115285,5,B0002PYS7Y,"""Arrested Development"" Season One is a perfect comedy. Combining elements of comedy, parody, and satire better than any show in memory, and adding sly plot twists in every episode makes for intelligent humor that is far more sophisticated than other network television fare.

The performances and characters are extremely well-developed, yet subtly nuanced. It's impossible to single out a cast member for excellence, as everyone plays their part so beautifully. Jason Bateman as Michael is most central to the plot, and couldn't be more perfect: whatever he does in the future will be unable to live up to this effort. Likewise, Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful as the imprisoned Bluth family patriarch. The show makes excellent satirical points about the irresponsibility of celebrity wealth, and can be viewed on many levels, although I prefer it as straightforward comedy.

The DVD set contains numerous bonuses including the extended pilot, commentaries (which are almost as funny as the show), a couple of behind the scenes documentaries, and the original music used in the show. Some viewers may find the show to be a bit racy, though normally in an intelligent, innuendo-laden way.

2115332,5,B0002PYS7Y,"The Honeymooners ran for only one season, yet is considered a classic.  Full House ran for years and years, yet few would consider it a classic in anything other than a camp fashion.  The lesson is that duration is not a standard for determining what makes classic TV.  Arrested Development ran for only three seasons (two of which were shortened), yet it is not only a classic, it is one of the best TV comedies ever.

Told in a mock documentary style, Arrested Development is the chronicle of one of the more dysfunctional families on TV.  Season One begins with patriarch George Bluth under arrest for a series of crimes related to his home construction business.  While he languishes in prison, it falls on his son Michael to hold things together, an effort that keeps being undermined by his family:  his older brother Gob (pronounced Job with a long o), a not-very-gifted magician; his twin sister Lindsey who adopts various causes when she's not out clothes-shopping; his mother Lucille who has virtually no maternal instinct; his younger brother Buster, a man-child with a strange mother-fixation; his brother-in-law Tobias (Lindsey's husband), an ex-doctor turned wannabe actor, and his niece Maeby, a schemer who relishes her own parents' neglect.  Only Michael and his son George-Michael are relatively normal, but even they have their quirks, particularly George Michael's crush on his cousin Maeby.

Adding to all the fun is Ron Howard's brilliant narration; sometimes even he gets emotionally involved, such as when one character insults another by calling him Opie.  And there are all some great guest stars, including Henry Winkler as the Bluths' inept attorney; Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a prosecutor who may or may not be blind; Heather Graham as George Michael's ethics teacher who he (and every other male student) has a crush on; and Liza Minelli as Lucille 2, Lucille's rival and Buster's bizarre love interest.

There are 22 episodes in this set, and all are brilliantly funny: if I've omitted much in the way of plot description, it's mainly because the episodes have to experienced, not merely described, to be fully enjoyed.  Beyond the episodes, we get a few extras, including the original, uncut pilot episode, a handful of episode commentaries, some behind-the-scenes looks and some deleted scenes.  In its time, it was unappreciated by most people and treated rather shabbily by Fox (who tossed it everywhere in the schedule), but now on DVD, you have the opportunity to see TV comedy at its best.",1182556800,,2524,5.038461538461538

Sure the ratings were never very spectacular, but those Nielsen statistics aren't always as accurate as they seem, plus the show was thrown all over the schedule. The DVD sales have always been impressive, but not enough to bring it back. At least there is one group of people watching this show, critics. This show has been critically acclaimed too much to take account for. Not to mention the 5 Emmys it's won. I was heartbroken when this show was taken off the air. It's one of the biggest mistakes in the FOX network's history. The show just needed time, look at Seinfeld, it never broke the top 20 ratings until season five! But at least there are still 53 episodes and 3 seasons to remember it by.

There is so much humor packed into every episode that it is a joy to watch each episode over and over again.  Not since Seinfeld have I laughed out loud at a sitcom so often.

2115338,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I started watching this show a little late and at a casual glance I was put off by it's free-hand camera style and narration. Usually you can sit down and watch a show and at least feel comfortable in how they're presenting the material. But what this show accomplished it nothing short of astounding. It's so different that you have to let their style sink in as a new way of watching TV.

When Desi Arnez invented the sitcom style by putting cameras and an audience in front of the set for I Love Lucy, that became the standard for over 40 years. Just like that show will be noted as a turning point in TV history, I think Arrested Development will also go down as one of the greatest shows of all time.

Their scripts were crammed with so many jokes, it took my friends and I nearly an hour to watch one episode because we either missed a quick graphic insert (""Analrapist"" anyone?) or we were laughing so much that we had to keep going back to hear the next line of dialogue.

They kept building on every joke and there were so many call-backs and running gags that towards the end of the series they were at a frantic pace. You could easily make 3 or 4 episodes of an average sitcom out of 1 of theirs. I think they always felt the end was near and tried to get every idea in before they were cancelled. It's very sad that they couldn't transfer it to cable or come up with some kind of deal to do partial seasons.

Don't even hesitate to buy these DVDs if you don't own them or haven't seen the show. I'd pay the price of the entire box set for a single new episode. You're very lucky have the chance to watch this masterpiece for the first time.

Things are going pretty crappily in the world right now, but if the fates can come together and meld these writers and actors into something so utterly perfect, maybe there's hope for everything else. (yes, a corny sentiment, but it's really that good)",1176595200,,1906,4.283333333333333

Yet we live in a tragic time in which Jim Belushia is a sitcom star, Scrubs is still running, and the perpetrators of 30 Rock haven't been stoned to death for crimes against humor. The banal, the bland, and the boring.

Meet the Bluths.

Lucille, the evil drunken socialite whose sexuality comes in handy when the business is in trouble and who refers to her children as ""third-least-favorite"" as a term of endearment.

Sweet-faced teen George Michael, is eager to please, dorky, and sexually attracted to his girl cousin and constantly trying to get her to see a dirty French film about cousins in love (hint hint).

Tobias, a mustachioed married man, completely flaming, who speaks exclusively in obscene double-entendres, yet is moronically unaware of it. And he's a nevernude (which exactly what it sounds like).

Two and a half seasons is more than I expected we'd ever get of this one. FOX played time-slot poker with it, which is as certain a cause of death as running TOWARD the noise of screaming teens in a haunted house on Friday the Thirteenth. A devoted fan from day one, I had a heck of a time finding the show to watch, and new episodes came on randomly, amid long stretches of reruns. Which TV exec decided that the right way to drum up fans was to constantly re-run the weakest episode? (A sweeps-month stunt involving the unspeakably creepy Martin Short playing a lecherous elderly cripple).

2115371,5,B0002PYS7Y,"When Arrested Development first came out on television, all I heard was an enormous amount of hype. So much in fact that I avoided it assuming it was just another sitcom with laugh tracks to tell people that a joke was funny. This is far from that, and let me tell you it was well worth the hype.

The story revolves around the dysfunctional Bluth family. A family that once had it all, is now struggling to survive thanks to the imprisonment of George Bluth, the owner of the family fortune. After he is sent away the family falls to pieces. Michael Bluth, is a twin middle child who has the smarts to keep the family afloat. He trys to manage the assests, and keep the business alive but it won't be easy with a family like this.

The cast may be one of the best I'd ever seen. Every character works wonderfully together. The show does an excellent job of giving character depth and good back stories to every single person which is something a comedy show could only dream of doing. Every member of the cast is so diverse, each brings a different style of comedy that blends perfectfully together.

This is a thinkings mans comedy. While there are the occasional over the top jokes, most require you to appreciate subtlety which is what makes it so fantastic. Lots of inside jokes continue through the season and by the time the finale airs you'll be wishing there was more. On to season two!",1169683200,3,1395,4.462745098039216

2115378,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This was one of my favourite 5 TV shows, until its too-early demise.  Arrested Development follows a wildly funny fall-rise-fall scenario for each of the individual characters of the Bluth family, as well as for the family fortune itself.  In the pilot, the family patriarch is arrested and the family's assets frozen, and pretty much the rest of the show is about the middle son (Michael) trying to run the family company and make money in spite of the rest of his hilariously incompetent relatives.

The mother is a lush, the older brother (Gob, pronounced Job) is a failed magician who continually ignores the limits of his talent, the sister (Lindsay) only has experience with spending money rather than making it, and the youngest brother (Buster) is a complete failure at life and molly-coddled by his mother.  Add in Lindsay's hopeless/hapless husband (who becomes and will remain an unemployed actor in all the shows) and strong-willed teenage daughter, and Michael's placid, naive teenage son George-Michael, and you have an extended family moving inevitably from one disasterous scenario to the next.

The show uses, what I would call, ""fake reality-tv"" type camera work.  The scripts are funny (NO toilet humour) and witty, the acting is brilliant, and the episodes build on each other, so really should be watched in the correct sequence.  If you want a great laugh, with characters you can feel for, this is the show for you.",1168300800,3,1438,4.99163179916318

It is something of a poor man's Royal Tannenbaums (which I loved), but it is NOT the Royal Tannenbaums. It offered a fair number of clever bits and characterizations. However, I could never fully enjoy the show for two reasons:  1) Ron Howard was the wrong choice for narrator. When the narrator is just right, you know it immediately (quite literally, after the narrtor spoke her first ten words on the opening episode of Desparate Housewives, it seemed THE perfect voice and that the show could not prosper or even exist without exactly THAT voice as narrator); and 2) Jeffery Tambor is greatly overrated (his comic style is that worn out, 1950's shtick). He is also, somehow, an extremely unlikeable actor. I can't put my finger on why that is so, but others who thought they would like the show and didn't often mentioned this to me BEFORE I brought it up. I watched one episode of his recent flop with John Lithgow. Admittedly the premise was weak and the writing predictable.

2115394,5,B0002PYS7Y,"'Arrested Development' is one of the most criminally underwatched shows in the history of television. The cast is pitch perfect from the principles to the guests and right down to the superb narration by producer Ron Howard. The writing is pure genius, weaving the saga of the Bluth family into a comedic goldmine. You see, the Bluths are a spoiled, self centered family whose world is turned upside down when the patriarch, George, lands himself in prison for some shifty accounting in the family business. It is up to Michael, the good son, to hold his family together in the face of financial ruin and to keep the business afloat. This is no easy task considering that his family ruins the best of his intentions at every turn. His mother, Lucille, is a lush WASP who sees her children as an inconvenience until she can get something out of them -- a role that Jessica Walter makes sympathetic through her brilliant performance (and watch for Liza Minnelli's appearances as Lucille's vertigo-suffering social nemesis, Lucille 2). Brother Gob (pronounced like the biblical figure Job) is a reckless womanizer and aspiring illusionist, while younger brother Buster is a hopeless man-child stuck in the role of Mama's boy. Twin sister Lindsay is a misguided activist, whose pet projects inevitably fall victim to her wandering attention span and need for pampering. Brother-in-law Tobias is a failed psychologist and failing actor and, in a running joke, blessedly unaware of his repressed homosexuality. To top matters off, his son, George Michael, seems to have developed a crush on his rebellious cousin, Maebe. Also on hand is the great Henry Winkler (once known as the Fonz) in a recurring role as the Bluth's hopelessly inept lawyer, Barry Zuckerkorn. You would think that their myriad plotlines would get out of hand, but the writers manage to keep them in check. And wherever the plotlines go, laughs follow. I have never laughed so hard at a TV show as I have watching 'Arrested Development'. It is actually beneficial to have the DVD so you can rewind if your laughing makes you miss some of the lines. The really great thing is that the humor never wore thin during the show's two and a half season run, but it's best to start at the beginning with season one because, unlike most sitcoms, 'Arrested Development' is a linear show -- what happens in one episode effects what happens in the next. When you're finished with the first season I feel confident that you'll race out to get seasons two and three. It's that good.

I would particularly recommend 'Arrested Development' to fans of 'The Office' -- the only show that comes close to Development's perfection -- because they have the same type of humor. It is a shame that we won't be getting any new episodes of 'Arrested Development', but at least we can still enjoy the show with the DVDs.",1166313600,12,2857,4.830612244897959
2115395,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I -adore- this program. The narrative humor, and zany family never ceases to produce a laugh in this not so sit-com television show.

If that doesn't bug you, (and why should it; if you enjoy the show you'll sympathize) you'll enjoy more of the bizarre and silly episodes that make this show so endearing.

There's not much to say that's not already been said. The special features are so-so, but that's not the only reason to buy a DVD series these days, and honestly, the quality of the episodes more than makes up for it.

There have been plenty of series' that were canned way too early and never given the time to grow, but thankfully Fox had the good sense to give Arrested Development a fighting chance, before ultimately pulling the plug after three seasons.  Created by Mitchell Hurwitz and executive produced by Ron Howard (who also narrates) and Brian Grazer, Arrested Development tells the sordid and hilarious tale of the Bluth family, who gets rocked with controversey when their wealthy empire falls on hard times when patriarch George (Jeffrey Tambor) finds himself and jail, and son Michael (Jason Bateman) must do everything he can to keep the family together; ranging from his alcoholic, pill-popping mother (Jessica Walter), wanna-be magician brother Gob (Will Arnett), useless brother Buster (Tony Hale), his twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), her clueless husband (the hilarious and deadpan David Cross), their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat), and his own son George Michael (Michael Cera) who secretly houses a massive crush on his cousin.  Yeah, and you thought your family was weird.  A comedy that isn't for everybody, Arrested Development got by thanks to it's sharp, witty writing and amazing ensemble cast, and Howard's deft narration didn't hurt either.  Loved by critics and revered by it's loyal fans, Arrested Development struggled in the ratings department, which is a shame because it is all so rare that sitcoms are this inventive and funny.  This first season is proof of this, and it's a shame that this brilliant comedy met it's demise far too soon.  All in all, Arrested Development isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoyed the show while it was on or are looking to check it out to see what all the fuss was about, this is definitely worth picking up, as are the following seasons.",1162339200,2,1876,5.012861736334405

Bought this after reading rave reviews online almost every site. Thanks to some of the reviews here, I discovered a gem that slipped past for way too long. For 'calibration' on sense of humour - I'm a huge Simpsons fan and 'Arrested' to me is the best sitcom to date.

I suspect one of the reasons the show got axed is that it is difficult to enjoy the series if you missed the first few episodes and only catching it every now and then.

However, watching the series on DVD means you get to grow with the funniest dysfunctional family on TV!! Several celebrity guests appearance as well. You'll laugh when watching it and laugh again when thinking about it.

2115405,5,B0002PYS7Y,"When I first saw trailers for this show where the father was having a blast in prison I thought that it looked stupid. However I watched an episode because it was on after The Simsons and I realized that this was a very funny show. The only problem was that it was half way through the season so I missed some of the episodes. I don't buy shows on dvd but I had to get this one because it's that good.

This has got to be one of the most funny shows ever. It's a blend of dry, sarcastic,  and physical humor. I find myself laughing throughout each episode. Another good thing is that it's not shot in fron of an audience so you get to see more of the sets and there's more mobility frm the characters. It's actualy shot like a documentary and at times they make it out to be a documentary. There is also a narriator who sometimes becomes annoying because he'll repeat what a character had previously done or why they're donig something which sometimes becomes annoying. Also there isn't a laugh track which I really like because I hate laugh tracks because it's like they tell you what to laugh at because you're so stupid that you don't get the jokes or the jokes are just bad.
All the characters on the show are funny. There isn't one person who is alright and you think the show could be just as funny without them.

If you're looking for a different kind of comedy show then you should get this because it really is one of a kind and you will find yourself watching it over and over again.",1159920000,,1493,4.25
2115406,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I was introduced to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT through a good friend. From watching the first episode I was hooked.  Unfortunately, I was one of many people who didn't discover the show until after it had been canceled at Fox.  The show is filmed in veritae style (like a documentary) and though much of the acting seems to be improved, it is not.  The writing on the show is full of wit and humor and is funny on numerous different levels, not to mention that a small side joke might have significance a few episodes or even a season later.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is a character oriented show and every character has a very important role to play in the situations and development of the overarching storyline of the series.

The show stars Jason Bateman as widower Michael Bluth, the only semi-normal and average person in one of the most dysfunctional families ever seen on television.  Bateman had some success as a kid and young adult in television (a reoccurring guest role on SILVER SPOONS and on VALERIE/HOGAN'S FAMILY), but the role of Michael Bluth was perfect for Bateman.  It gave him an opportunity to put into practice all of his talent and experience and actually carry a show of misfits as the straight man.  Though Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth is the person who keeps his family together, the rest of the cast offers superb performances too.  There's the lovely Porita de Rossi as Michael's twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke, Will Arnett Michael's older brother ""Gob"" who works as a magician, Michael Cera as Michael's son George-Michael Bluth, Alia Shawkat as Lindsay's daughter Maeby Funke whom George-Michael has a major crush on, Jeffery Tambor as the father of the Bluth clan who gets sent to prison in the first episode because of a major development deal that might have included minor treason, Jessica Walter as Lucille Bluth the mother of the Bluth children who, David Cross as Lindsay's husband Tobias Funke who is a never nude, Tony Hale as Michael's childlike younger brother Buster, and Ron Howard as the narrator of this ""story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.""  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT also boasted an impressive list of guest stars including Henry Winkler, Liza Minnelli, Ed Begley Jr, Charlize Theron, Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Scott Baio, Carl Weathers, Justine Bateman, Andy Richter, Zach Braff, and Jamie Kennedy.

The general plot-line of Season One follows the Bluth family as George Bluth is arrested in the pilot episode at his retirement party aboard the company yacht because of some major bad land development deals (get it, arrested development).  His son Michael is prepared to leave with his own son George-Michael to Arizona after his mother Lucille is named President of the Bluth Company instead of himself.  However, for the love of his son and the neediness of his family, Michael stays behind and attempts to get the family business back on track while trying to get dear old dad out of jail.

Some of my favorite episodes include:

""The Extended Pilot""--flows better than the cut pilot that aired on television and includes several scenes that help extend the characterization.

""Bringing Up Buster""--Buster is kicked out of Lucille's penthouse and moves into the model home.  Meanwhile George-Michael takes a role in the school play (being directed by his uncle Tobias) hoping that he will get to kiss Maebe, but after Maebe drops out, George-Michael is supposed to kiss the male lead.

""My Mother, The Car""--Michael has partial amnesia after being involved in a car accident that Lucille was responsible for.

""In God We Trust""--the family attorney announces that George Sr. can be released on $20,000 bail for the annual `Living Classics Pageant'.  This episode is hilarious, especially towards the end as George Sr. bolts down the street wearing a God costume.

""Beef Consomme""--Michael, Gob, and Buster all fight over who gets to go out with Marta.  The fight between the brothers at the end of the episode is particularly funny.

""Missing Kitty""--George Sr.'s former secretary goes missing after Gob performs a huge magic trick during a spring break stunt.

""Whistler's Mother""--the reveal that George Sr. has a twin brother, Uncle Oscar.  Oscar tries to get some free cash from Michael by selling him a piece of land that is literally full of lemons.

""Let Them Eat Cake""--the family learns that the reason George Sr. is in prison is because he was illegally building homes in the old Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Pay attention to the hilarious ""Big Bear"" speech that Gob delivers after believing his father has died in the hospital after a heart attack.

Though it is true that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT doesn't appeal to a typical sitcom-sense-of-humor, the show is incredibly intelligent, witty, and funny.  It won't appeal to everyone, but many will at least find it intriguing, and some (like myself) will become fans.

The DVD includes several extras including commentaries of the episodes ""Extended Pilot"", ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake""; deleted and extend scenes, original music and songs by David Schwartz composed for the show; three featurettes; a segment of the cast panel discussion at The Museum of Television & Radio; a promo; and an inside look at the series with Ron Howard.",1159833600,6,5326,4.978555304740406
2115407,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Try to remember the most fun you've ever had. Chances are you're thinking about time you spent with close friends. In your funniest memory, your friends aren't telling set-up/punchline jokes, are they? The fun is in the journey and in a mutual appreciation of one another's idiosyncrasies. The inside jokes that can make you laugh on a street corner 10 years after the initial incident are things that happened, not formula joke.

Arrested Development is not a sit-com. It is not a 3 camera set-up/punchline show. It is character-driven comedy that gets funnier the more time you spend with the characters, learning their histories, understanding past events. Jokes build in layers from episode to episode and season to season, because they are rooted in the characters, rather than being contrived one-liners.

Unequaled storytelling and fantastic performances can make you laugh just as hard with a deadpan silence as they can with an absurd dance. The humor is a constant non-stop stream. If there is something happening on the screen it is either (a)planting the seed for a joke that is growing (b)the payoff for a joke that has been brewing (c)a callback to a joke that already happened. The jokes are as layered and deep as you can hope for.

Examples- For most of one episode, Tony Hale's character, Buster, is missing his prosthetic hook--his hand having been bitten off by a trained seal his magician brother released into the wild. Eventually someone asks where it is and the show cuts to him doing The Robot to ""Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto"" and accidentally stabbing the hook into the dashboard of the family ""stair car"" - Which is all a callback to Tony Hale's famous 1999 VW commercial in which he dances to the same song inside the new VW. (Of course I didn't catch that until later)

The episode in which Justine Bateman plays a prostitute that Jason Bateman mistakes for a long-lost sister is titled Family Ties.

George Bluth says that when he met Saddam Hussein he didn't know who it was and complimented him for his work as the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. Episodes later the brothers visit a house full of Saddam doubles- one of which is discreetly played by Larry Thomas (played the Soup Nazi for Seinfeld)

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ANALYZE THE JOKES OR WORK HARD TO FIND EASTER EGGS LIKE THESE! But when you consider just how dense the humor is, you can laugh as much or as little as you choose. Brain turned on = funny. Brain turned off (traditional position for sit-coms, which are like humor T-ball games) = not funny.

It's an absolute feast of comedy if you're willing to go along for the ride. Funniest show ever. Sad that it didn't find a wider audience. I would have subscribed to premium cable just to watch the show if it had transferred.",1158624000,,2754,4.7012448132780085
2115408,4,B0002PYS7Y,"It's a shame Arrested Development only lasted 53 episodes.  But when you think about it, it's really not hard to see why the show was cancelled so early.  Fox is one of those networks that will either deliver totally memorable or totally horrible programming.  There's really no in between.  I never get the urge to scream ""GENIUS!"" when I think about Arrested Development (like many people do) but if you watch a few episodes you'll see what makes the show so funny.  You have to keep in mind that the humor isn't meant to be in your face.  It's *really* important you understand this.

Arrested Development never took off for a variety of reasons.  Probably the most obvious reason: most people didn't understand the subtle humor that made the show so popular among certain fans.  I have to admit, I didn't understand the humor at first either.  I couldn't understand if the show was supposed to be a drama or a comedy, and why so much thought and energy was being devoted to strange storyline twists and characters walking around doing weird things.  Eventually the humor clicked, and I began to see there was a REASON for the things that seemed pointless the first time around.  The weirdness had a purpose after all.

I began to realize that every single character was MEANT to be in the show, and all the storyline twists and turns that originally seemed so clumsy and unusually-placed were actually all part of the unpredictability factor.  All these things added up to one wild, extremely funny show.

Once you get into the characters, the humor will probably make sense.  In my opinion, most of the people who watched one or two episodes and didn't laugh simply couldn't understand the fact that not all humor has to be plainly obvious.  When watching Arrested Development, you have to search for the jokes.

I don't think the humor is quite as intelligent as most people will tell you.  I mean, I'm not really a smart guy and I can understand most of the jokes.  The trick to getting into Arrested Development is to REALLY pay attention to *everything* going on.  Pay attention to the characters and the storyline progression.  If you don't, you probably won't see the humor.  It's really that simple (or complicated, I don't know!)

That's another problem.  The average person who watches a comedy show has trouble understanding how searching for something is supposed to be funny.  Well, I think what's happening is that a new style of comedy is developing as we speak, and many people don't know how to approach it.  I think a show like the Office is another example of this style of comedy.  The jokes are there, but hidden.  If you give yourself time to search for them, you *will* find them.

I think not including a laugh track is confusing to many people.  Without a laugh track some people don't know WHAT to think.  It does NOT mean you are dumb if you can't get into Arrested Development- it simply means you have not yet allowed yourself to look at this style of humor in a new light.  The show is *definitely* not ordinary.  Don't let this throw you off.

To be honest, Arrested Development isn't a style of comedy for everyone.  But trust me, there's a reason Arrested Development is respected so much.  What might seem like a pointless storyline at first is probably leading up to something totally twisted that you will *never* expect!  It's all part of the charm.

I'll admit, Arrested Development never makes me laugh out loud, but it's a style that's pretty creative and twisted, and makes you crave more when you eventually get into it.  Once you understand the humor you're hooked for life.  Including a laugh track would have RUINED the show.  I believe laugh tracks are starting to become old-fashioned anyway.

Don't worry if you can't get into Arrested Development the first couple times you watch an episode.  Just please understand that you HAVE to give it a few serious chances so everything will fall into place in your head.  When that happens, you *will* enjoy it.  It's just too bad the show couldn't hang around for another 100 episodes.",1158624000,17,4080,4.691114245416079
2115419,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Simply put, ARRESTED DELELOPMENT has to be one of the best comedy shows ever to air on TV.  Here is your chance to either relive it's greatness, or to discover a true gem.  I usually would not buy, or recommend buying DVD's of a TV series.  With most series, you would watch it once, or twice and then it would collect dust until you either gave it away or sold it.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is the sort of series that can hold up to repeated viewings and actually improve with each new visit.  There are so many inside references to pick up that one usually misses them while laughing uncontrollably the first time around.

This is the rare series with an excellent cast and writers that are on top of their game.  Despite their shortcomings you learn to love the characters for all their idiosyncrasies and questionable behavior.

2115428,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I just started re-watching this series via streaming, and I'm amazed at the brilliance of the show. It's very rare that writers put their fingers so accurately on anything such as dysfunction and actually make it work, but they do so here to an amazing triumph. Each of the characters is well-drawn, well-scripted, and well-acted, and the genius is in the way that they're able to semi-function as a family even though each character is completely focused on self (with the possible exceptions of George Michael and George). The strength of this show to me is in the way that each actor nails his or her part, maintaining a semblance of family unity while staying focused on self-fulfillment--they basically use each other to try to meet their own needs. I've read some of the one-star reviews, and I get the feeling that the main problem for the reviewers was not being able to get past the complete selfishness of the characters in order to see the satire that the show is giving us. . . it's a shame that satire is such a lost art in the states these days.

All in all, this show does take a significant suspension of disbelief (who wants to believe that these people can be so incredibly selfish?) and a willingness to get to know characters who aren't all that likeable, but the result most definitely is worth it--some of the funniest lines I've ever heard have come in this show. It also takes paying close attention for the subtle expressions and often delayed reactions that come in response to something that happened several seconds--or even minutes--earlier. Many of the jokes will fall flat if you didn't catch a previous joke, and this is one of the few shows in which they have the guts to try for laughs through silence--and they succeed much more often than not. If I were a drama teacher, this would be a brilliant tool for teaching young actors and actresses the power of the subtle change in expression that the actors use so well.

2115438,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Yes, you read that right. There has never been a show as funny or as unique as Arrested Development. You may think the dysfunctional family idea is played out on network TV, but believe me you have never seen it played quite like this. For one thing, the format of the show allows for a lot more comedy than a typical sitcom; it's shot like a single camera documentary, complete with narration, except the characters never address the camera directly - which helps to keep it more believable. Plus, on top of the frequently absurd and hilarious situations the Bluths manage to get themselves into, the narrator is a source of humor as well, as are the quick flashback edits that not only reveal info about our characters but allow for lots of running gags throughout. A lot of great character development comes from these montages and one-shot visual gags.

The first season focuses on the plight of Michael Bluth (a stellar Jason Bateman), who has toiled away at his family's land development company for years and is finally at the point where he is expecting a promotion - which never comes, much to his chagrin, although we later learn why in a rare poignant moment. He wants bigger and better things for himself and his overly-neurotic son, George Michael (Michael Cera). His father, George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor), has run the company for years - often with shady deals or outright fraud - and isn't exactly the best role model for Michael or his son. Neither is his mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), an alcoholic control freak who has a habit of saying the nastiest thing that pops into her head.

This has had a disturbing effect on the children in the Bluth household. While Michael is the most ""normal"" of the bunch, he is still sometimes self-centered and strict towards his son, though they do truly love each other and he's only trying to be a good parent since his wife died. His siblings, however, are far less lucky. His older brother, George Oscar Bluth III (Will Arnett) - or GOB, pronounced ""Job"" - is a failed ""illusionist"" and lothario who still constantly seeks approval from his father; his younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is a sheltered child-like buffoon who still lives with their mother. And his ""twin"" sister, Lindsay (Portia di Rossi), is a sexually frustrated, rebellious money-grubber who is married (out of spite) to Dr. Tobias Funke (David Cross), an analyst/therapist - or analrapist, if you will - who has lost his license to practice medicine and now wishes to become an actor. Their daughter, Maeby (Alia Shawkat), tends to ignore them both and isn't very attached to the notion of school or learning, though her own rebellious schemes are quite clever. George Michael has a taboo crush on her, which results in a lot of humorous problems for him throughout the series.

The plotting is quite dense, especially for a comedy. There are frequently long joke arcs that run over multiple episodes or even seasons, but when they pay off they are MUCH funnier than anything else on television, ever. Some of these in Season 1 include - GOB's hilariously bad illusions, Buster and Annyong's rivalry, Michael's terrible luck with women, George Michael's pining for his cousin, Tobias' miserable attempts to succeed as an actor (""We're having a FIRE...sale!""), and lots of others. Many times, a single line of dialogue can have several different meanings and can also reveal a major secret about a character (For example, the seemingly innocuous phrase ""Justice is blind"" ends up destroying a relationship AND a court case, all at once). There are lots of puns and clever word-play, a lost art form single handedly resuurected by this show, and Tobias rountinely uses highly suggestive double-entendres with gay undertones, such as - ""Unfortunately, I've shot my wad on what was supposed to be something of a dry run and now I've got a bit of a mess on my hands."" The trouble that all the characters get into usually directly their own doing and often waaaay out there but since all the actors play it straight they never seem contrived or forced and somehow manage to become even funnier.

Several other minor characters pop in regularly - the best being Judy Greer as George's lover and secretary Kitty, who has a habit of exposing herself; and Justin Lee as the lovable Korean adoptee Annyong (literally ""Hello""), who Lucille adopts just to spite Buster. Carl Weathers plays a parody of himself as a cheapskate out-of-work actor; Henry Winkler (yes, Fonzie) plays the incompetent, closet homosexual Bluth lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays an attorney as well, one with a penchant for lying that creates several awkward moments; and Amy Poehler is hilarious as GOB's seal-selling wife (she is Will Arnett's wife in real life). Special mention, however, goes to Liza Minneli, who plays Lucille's vertigo-prone neighbor Lucille Austero (or Lucille 2), and also Jeffrey Tambor - not only is he a riot as George Sr. (who in prison for most of the season, and loves it), but he also plays George's twin brother Oscar, and manages to make him a totally different character (as a pot-smoking hippie who's in love with Lucille and may or may not be Buster's real father).

DVD is the preferable way to watch this series, because as I said earlier the jokes build on each other and become funnier when viewed in proper sequence (and of course, no commercials). The set also includes great commentaries on the Extended Pilot, ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake"", plus a cast panel discussion and plently of deleted/extented scenes and bloopers. I would recommend buying both Seasons 1 and 2 together - not only will your AD marathon last longer, but you'll save money and Season 2 is even better than this one (which I didn't think was possible, but trust me, it is). So, if you're tired of cliche filled, laugh-track laden network comedy, spend some time with the Bluth family and see what you're missing. They put the fun back in ""dysfunctional"".

2115460,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This is one of the funniest, wittiest shows to ever be on television.

There are some good summaries already posted here on Amazon, so I'll focus on how I think the DVDs are worthy of purchase.

Season one of Arrested Development is terrific. It is about as perfect as I could imagine a comedy ever being. It is witty, fast-paced, bawdy and brilliant.

The Season One DVD set includes a lot of background and information. The extended pilot alone, with Ron Howard's commentary, is absolutely worth the price of this set alone.

Some of the jokes are very subtle, some are very obvious. This show demands that you watch each episode more than once, as many of the jokes become more apparent in a second or third viewing. You just can't catch them all the first time. Also, there is a lot of very subtle foreshadowing in many episodes.

I will never tire of watching this show. It is guaranteed to give you many belly laughs and funny one-liners you'll never forget. There are jokes in this show that make me laugh so hard that I get tears in my eyes, even the third or fourth time I've seen them.

Every time I loan AD DVDs to friends to watch, they are instantly addicted and mesmerized by the brilliant comedy - the writing, acting, and production.

Alas, the show officially ended its run today - creator Mitch Hurwitz announced that he will not continue with the series. Fortunately, the show was wrapped up brilliantly in the final episodes on this DVD set.

I cannot imagine that anyone who loves sharp, witty comedy wouldn't love this show.",1143504000,5,1546,4.576086956521739

2115466,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This is situation comedy at its very best.  Once again, broadcast television shows itself to be the haven of inventive, clever writing.  In Arrested Development superior writing is matched with excellent acting.  The result is a show that is consistently witty, employing an inspired blend of witty dialogue, awful puns, and slapstick commedy.  Enjoy the ride as the hapless Bluths stagger from one comedy of error to another, blissfully ignorant that their actions have consequences along the way.

Jason Bateman delivers a well-tuned performance as the arguably sane, responsible member of this outrageous extended family, delivering some of the best dead-pan lines I have ever heard.

Jeffrey Tambor, already well known for bringing quirky odballs to life on the screen (remember Judge Wachtell from 'Hill Street Blues?), excells as George Bluth, erstwhile, felonious father of the fractious family.  Jessica Walter is fully believable as the manipulative matriarch who is more concerned with family warfare than family welfare.  Her machinations as she pits one of her offspring against another are worthy of Elanor of Aquitaine.

Each member of the cast performs to perfection making the outrageous, improbably zany situations in which they find themselves seem as quotidian as our own lives.

I encourage anyone who has grown up in a family to get to know the Bluths - your own family can only benefit by comparison with this crazy clan of engaging narcissists.  The laughs will do us all good.

I eagerly await the release of seasons three and four.",1142294400,,1556,5.204819277108434

The writing is snappy, the characters delightfully horrible, the mandatory ""life's lessons"" learnt at the end of each episode are twisted just enough to take a dig at the other feel-good series around it - all in all, wonderful.

The acting is terrific - I had pigeonholed some of the actors prior to seeing the series, and boy was I wrong.  Portia de Rossi is fantastic (although I'm a fellow Skip, I didn't think all that much of her before.  Now I'd cheerfully worship at her feet), Justin Bateman - wow - why isn't he elsewhere?  Will Arnett as GOB makes me guffaw just by thinking about him - Buster is uncanny - the list goes on.

I can understand why it was cancelled.  It was too good, too witty, and too cutting.  Seems as though if you live in the US or Australia, audiences appreciate bland more than tasty.  This was tasty.

The amount of stuff that goes on in a single episode is amazing.

It was joy to discover all the different layers in terms of characters, things that you may not necessarily get being a casual fan.

2115504,5,B0002PYS7Y,"No need to reiterate the set-ups, the plot summaries or the praise - just to add my voice to those who recognize this as one of the sharpest, funniest comedy series ever created. The writing is stellar and the cast is note-perfect. They rise to the demands of breakneck farce - not the easiest thing to do outside of a theatre. Obviously the brilliant (and very fast) editing is an asset, as is Ron Howard's narration. Too many high points to single out - but just a few:

- the guest stars: Liza Minnelli, Heather Graham and Henry Winkler are just a few. Winkler is simply hysterical as possibly the most unethical, incompetent lawyer in California. What marvellous clowns!

- the long-arc continuity gags. ""Say, that looks just like our kitchen."" A set-up that takes more than 20 episodes to pay off, but when it does, it's amazing.

- Jeffrey Tambor. I've been an admirer of his for years, and thought that his incomparable schlemiel, Hank Kingsley (""Hey, now!"") from The Larry Sanders Show (RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS ON DVD, DAMMIT!) was his peak. But he reaches a new peak as Bluth, the crooked developer. His transformations from grieving arrestee to gang member to Jewish proeslytizer are funny enough, and his turn as ""Uncle Oscar"" is a charm, but the moment that had me on the floor was in the episode where Michael is trying to fire his Dad's assistant (played by the exquisite Judy Greer). Tambor is telling Michael, ""you don't know what it's like to fire someone, like when I had to fire my own twin brother, the face he made ... wait a minute, I can do that face,"" and then proceeds to re-enact his brother's hysterical pleading not to be fired. As I'm writing this, it isn't a hundredth as funny as the way Tambor delivers it - VERY fast and VERY funny. I howled.

The cancellation of this show tells you everything you need to know about the tastes of network executives. That this show was created and produced at all tells you all you need to know about the unbelievable depths of comic talent at work today - or, more likely, AVAILABLE for work!

2115507,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Let's just get the big stuff out of the way: This is the best network television comedy ever. Period. Seinfeld is a close number two (well, not that close). The really secret of this show is the writing and casting. The characters they created were set up from non-stop hilarity from the start, and the show's writers never dropped the ball. Not only do they maximize each character's comedy contribution, but they continuously build on the jokes of previous episodes and seasons. Watch for the blue hand prints all over the house in season two. Make sure you get the DVD, because you can miss alot of the jokes on TV, I'm still picking up new double meanings that i didn't even get in my first 3 viewings. Anyone that says this show isn't witty, clearly must have no wit of their own and rely on canned laugh tracks to tell them when something is funny (a feature that Arrested development has no need for). Pick up this DVD immediately, and get caught up and watch the final 4 episodes of season 3. Maybe if a couple million more people tune in, FOX might realize they are a bunch of italian suited idiots who just threw away the best show on TV. (In case you didn't hear, season 3 has been reduced to 13 episodes and fox has not optioned a new season). But never fear, there are still 53 terrific episodes through three seasons which is more than enough to teach you what you've been missing all these years.",1137628800,4,1411,4.430769230769231

Give the show your undivided attention and I promise it will all be worth it. After going through the first two seasons (the only 2 seasons on DVD at the time this was written) you'll want to buy yourself a copy.

I am a big fan of the show, and I believe it is on the same level if not better than Seinfeld. Most would argue this is an insult to Seinfeld, but I like to think that it's a comment on how great this show really is.

Some have said that this show has ""zero re-watchability,"" but this is entirely inaccurate. I've gone through seasons 1 and 2, and some of season 3, and went back and started over and many who have done so will notice so many more jokes they may have missed before simply because this show is layered with jokes, some of which cannot be understood until you've seen more episodes. Perhaps some may feel this is where the show's weakpoint lies: instead of episodic one-time jokes the show sets up these long joke-arcs -- but if the audience is patient they'll be rewarded with a much bigger payoff (also this style is conducive to loyalty to the show, as you'd have to watch more episodes to understand it all).

I find the show to be unbelievably funny, every minute something funny is going on. Sometimes I don't catch onto it but I usually watch the episodes two or three times, not because I want to but because I have to simply to catch things I missed.

Some argue the cast is ""no-name"" and has no talent, and as a result the show is forced to bring on guest stars. Although most of the cast is new there are some regular cast members who are well known (Tambor, Cross, Rossi). The new actors are every bit as talented in their roles -- anyone who has seen the show must admit the young Michael Cera (playing George Michael) is a delight, his comic timing and acting are superb. My guess is the guest stars were brought on as tools to bring more viewers into the fold. Yet these guest stars each played a memorable role, not some 1-episode stint (except season 3's Andy Richter, well at least so far). Will Arnet's character, GOB, was briefly married and the woman was played by Will Arnet's real-life wife Amy Poehler. There are a couple of jokes which make reference to this and of course they're funny.

There are many jokes on the show which may not seem obvious at first but with a little research you'll be surprised by how much you might've missed. (example: Tony Hale, as Buster, doing the 'Robot' in his car in season 3, which was a throwback to the actor's Mr. Roboto dance in the VW commercials).

Please don't think this show is too much work, not worth the effort -- you WILL get the jokes, and you'll get them better if you re-watch the episodes.

I'm sorry to hear the show's been cancelled but in my opinion this is one of the best comedy show's ever made. If any of the show's crew or staff read this, all your efforts were not in vain , you've made many laugh and fall in love with The Bluths.",1136764800,6,3086,4.292096219931271

2115525,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Ever wonder what it is like to fill completely satisfied by a television show? In my opinion, TV has sucked since Seinfeld left the air, with exception of HBO (which is not TV anyway as they so readily remind us with their commercials). I try my very best not to watch any of the crap NBC, CBS ABC and Fox tries to ram down my throat, but I will find myself getting pulled into some mindless dribble because my roommates are TV junkies. After a long day at the office, the last thing I want to do is wasted my time on a new high concept comedy staring Freddie Prince Jr. or a show dedicated to the recently glamorous world of forensic science. With all my angst aside, there are three network shows worthy of my valuable post-work time, Lost, Family Guy and Arrested Development.

Arrested Development was recommended to me by a co-worker when the first season became available on DVD. I read a lot of good things about the show and the Emmy and Golden Globe wins were impressive. However, being on FOX made me skeptical because they cannot do anything right except for animation, and the commercial spots were not funny. He persisted and was able to persuaded me to watch the first six episodes, which was roughly 2 hours of my time (yea I am big stickler about my free time), to see what I thought. I am so glad that I did. I have never laughed at show so hard nor thoroughly enjoyed one as much as I did Arrested Development. I quickly devoured the other two discs in the season, 24 episodes total, and began watching the second season which had just begun to air on TV.

I will not bore you with a synopsis, because you can get that anywhere, but I will say that if you want a show that is way above average and can appeal to your both your intellect and your humorous side, then this is the show for you. Also, if you have an insane family like I do, then it will be double the laughs. I now own both seasons on DVD and have most of season three on my recorded on my Tivo. All my siblings, roommates, and friends love the show thanks to me.

Unfortunately for all of us, FOX has decided to cancel the show, but I am keeping my finger and toes crossed that Showtime or HBO will pick it up. Do yourself a favor and get borrow or rent the DVDs.

2115526,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This show is definitely a fine investment in your collection of brilliant sitcoms.  Because there are so many long-running jokes in this season, I do think it's easier to own and watch at your leisure rather than wait a week.

If you're a person who enjoyed the BBC version of ""the Office,"" or ""Extras"" with Ricky Gervais, you will definitely appreciate the comedic pace of this show.  I also recommend this show to Wes Anderson lovers.  The sometimes dry delivery with overdramatic characters is a great contrast.

What I love most about this show is its subtle attention to values and ethics.  There are actually redeeming qualities in the characters, and the undertones exist to poke fun at some of the distasteful aspects of society.  For instance, the reference to ""Girls Gone Wild"" with a different name: ""Girls With Low Self-Esteem.""",1135641600,8,840,4.914893617021277
2115527,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This is the world we live in. Arrested Development, the funniest comedy in the last 10 years, is being taken off the air by Fox after three seasons. Meanwhile, Stacked is in its second season on Fox; Yes, Dear in its, what, ninth?! (I lost count); and many other crap-tastic sitcoms are still running. Where is the Punisher when we need him?

 Anyway, this is a review of the 1st season DVD set (which you have to buy, or you aren't...human), so listen newbies: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the only sane person in his family. His older brother Gob (Will Arnett) is a failed magician, excuse me, 'illusionist,' who always relies on Michael to get him out of tight spots; younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) is a thirtysomething still living with and relying on their mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), a selfish, alcohol-sipping woman; twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is unhappily married to struggling actor Tobias Funke (David Cross), and their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat) is in the middle of their shall-we-divorce-or-separate-or...etc.; and Michael's son George Michael (Michael Cera) is in love with Maeby, but she's his COUSIN! Oh yeah, and Michael's father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) passed Michael over for president of the Bluth housing company and is then arrested for embezzling from the company. With these people, who needs enemies?

 This is all the first episode, folks (give or take a plot point in the second and third). Unique in so many ways (no laugh track, thank God; filmed like a documentary; narration by executive producer Ron Howard; one of the best ensemble casts on television ever), it's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Yet it's one of the lowest-rated shows (in viewers, not reviews, which it dominates in) on television, and it was in danger of being cancelled its first season. So I suppose Fox was brave to give it two pity seasons (but the Emmys didn't hurt their decision, either).

2115529,5,B0002PYS7Y,"By an standard ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT has to go down as one of the finest comedy series in American television history.  Probably no other comedy series has had such a superb large ensemble cast with every member performing to absolute perfection.  Despite the large cast, there isn't a weak or nonessential link in the group.  The writing simply is about as good as writing can get and the visual brilliance generated by the editors and writers has no parallel in American comedy.  And it is funny!  Intensely funny!  Furthermore, the show has garnered a shelf full of Emmys and probably would have won its second straight Emmy for Best Comedy if viewers hadn't felt nostalgic for the rather bland EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND's final season.

So why isn't this one of the biggest hits on TV?  Why hasn't it been celebrated for the masterpiece it is?  And why has FOX ordered only a tiny handful of episodes for its third season, almost certainly indicating its cancellation after this season?  Certainly FOX's failure to support it fully is partly to blame.  FOX is easily the network I hate and detest the most.  I have so much ill will towards the network right now that I don't know if I will ever think of it without rancor.  It is one of the best if not the best network at developing interesting and innovative and original shows of the highest quality.  Yet is frequently fails to support its shows.  DARK ANGEL, FIREFLY, THE FAMILY GUY (though it was reprieved a couple of years after cancellation), and WONDERFALLS are merely four superb shows of the past five years that FOX showed only to cancel prematurely.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT now seems certain to be the next distinguished show to get axed.  How does it say about a network that would cancel a series that is not only its finest comedy but also quite probably the finest half hour comedy on TV?  Like I said, FOX is easily the network I hate the most and I rarely allow myself to watch series on the network now because I'm afraid that if I get involved FOX will pull the plug.

But there is a second question:  Why aren't the ratings any better for the show?  There is widespread speculation that the show might be too intelligent for casual, less involved viewers.  Over the past thirty-five years the public has embraced a few very intelligent comedies, including ALL IN THE FAMILY, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, CHEERS, and SEINFELD.  But it has also failed to embrace some marvelous comedies like this one and ANDY RICHTER CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE, while at the same time going wild over more or less bland shows like FRIENDS and EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.  I have no firm opinion here, but I do worry that we might be a nation that refuses to embrace the truly smart shows.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, probably the finest hour long show of the past decade, at its peak pulled in only a very small audience.  Maybe Americans as a whole do not like very smart shows.  On the other hand, LOST, a very smart show indeed, has a massive audience.  Perhaps the answer is a combination of factors.  The one thing that is certain is that if ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is indeed allowed to die, as seems likely, it will be a massive lost.  As the nation as a whole gradually discovers the show through the wonderful DVD sets, more and more people will perhaps ask, ""How was such an incredible show allowed to die?""

A few years ago NBC coined the expression ""Must See TV,"" a phrase that became a bit of a joke as many wags said that most of the shows it refered to was ""Must Flee TV.""  But if there is a Must See comedy on TV today, this is it.  By any standard this is marvelous television.  A growing number of individuals have come to believe that TV has finally begun to exploit its innate potential and begun in a great number of instances to surpass movies as the great medium for visual narrative.  Certainly ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the shows that bolsters the case for anyone so arguing.",1134518400,9,3944,4.561877667140825

What sets Arrested Development apart from the normal sitcom is most notable clever writing and subtle humor. You can watch an episode many times and catch something new every time.

It also has an excellent ensemble cast. Usually a sitcom has one or two stand out characters but I honestly can not pick a favorite from this series - they are all equally likeable and entertaining.

Many people think this show is overly intellectual with snobby humor. Well, it isn't! THIS SHOW IS NOT ANOTHER FRASIER! There are plenty of dirty jokes and distasteful humor packed in each episode. One of my favriotes episodes of season 1 is Peer Pressure, where Buster gets George Michael to buy maryjane for his girlfriend Lucille. I also love Growing Up Buster and My Mother,the Car.

In one of the 2 star reviews featured on Amazon, the reviewer mentioned that the main characetr's son is named George Michael and to him that wasn't very funny. However, this person obviously has not watched the show because that is very rarely ever mentioned on the show. The types of jokes made are about freeloading, sexual disfunction, prison time, alcoholism, and general family disfunction to name a few.",1134345600,3,947,4.9125

2115533,2,B0002PYS7Y,"Man, what is with this show? By the amount of 5 star reviews and buzz about this show, I was expecting it to be better than the Simpsons, the Office and Seinfeld combined. If anyone is familiar with sketch or other type of tv/movie comedies you quickly see that there are a lot of rip-offs. Naming a character George Michael is not funny and is very unoriginal. The movie ""Office Space"" has a character named Michael Bolton (get it - the singer). Also, David Cross in his other works has used this ploy of using funny or ironic names for characters (News Reporters named 'Mace' or 'Clint Dirk', etc.).

Besides dissecting all the other rip-offs or unoriginal jokes in this show, I'll just say for the 100 or so jokes that they try to cram in this show about 2 or 3 of them are actually funny and or original. The characters are also super annoying and way over the top (in a bad way). The general plot of the show is absurd and unrealistic. And the show just gets way too quirky and cutesy. Plus, why must almost every Fox comedy show (or for that matter any show that questions the viewer's intelligence) have a narrator talking to you throughout the whole show? Not only is the narrator's voice irritating and boring but it just gets in the way and make the show even more grueling to watch. Save your time any money and find a new show.

2115540,5,B0002PYS7Y,"A.D. is absolutely the most hilarious show my wife and I have seen since as far back as I can remember.  Honestly, I can't think of a single TV show that had me laughing hysterically for a full 22 minutes (not counting commercials) in my entire life.

Owning the DVDs has been a blessing because we easily missed 3-5 minutes worth of each episode when it aired because we were simply laughing too hard.  Now that we have Tivo, that doesn't happen any more, but the show takes longer to watch because we keep rewinding every few minutes to laugh again. :)

When A.D. first aired, it took a few episodes for us to really get into it because it's absolutely unlike any other comedy show I can think of.  This is perhaps why it's ratings aren't very good and why Fox has decided to cancel the show.  Instead of the standard ""set up the joke, deliver punchline"" template that most comedies follow, A.D.'s humour is almost entirely character-based.  While there are tons of hilarious visual jokes, the dialogue is delivered completely dead-pan as if it's really just something one would say to their brother/mother/father/girlfriend if their family was as messed up as the Bluths'.  As a result, it's not always what the person is saying that's funny, but the context in which they're saying it.  My guess is that a lot of this intelligent humour sails over most people's heads and they turn to ""Stacked"" to get more obvious (read: boring) jokes.  Quite often, some of the funniest lines come from the narrator (Ron Howard) who gets to reveal what's really going on in a character's head or recount a memory from the character's past.

Characters include Michael (the lead played by Jason Bateman who is the only one with a (mostly) clear head on his shoulders), his father (who's in prison for treason), his alcoholic and overbearing mother, his older narcissitic magician brother, his younger ""momma's boy"" brother, his perfectionist son, his spoiled twin sister and her family (a husband who doesn't know he's gay and their rebellious daughter), a LOUSY family lawyer (played fantastically by Henry Winkler) and a cast of cameos too long to list.

The commentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes on the DVDs are excellent.  They offer insight into the inner workings, and they show just how much fun everybody has making it.  Definitely worth watching!

I've hooked several friends onto the show and have ordered these DVDs for others I know would enjoy it.

This family is completely screwed up.  One of the funniest thing about the show is it's daytime ""Soap Opera"" format:  it quickly switches situational scenes almost violently between way too many characters, but their stories all seemingly fit together in a most unusual, coincidental way.  It satirizes the whole daytime drama genre.  The addition of the flashback scenes breaks up the monotonous, linear order of events, though, that tend to put most accidental daytime soap viewers to sleep, or vomit.  If you live in a big city, especially NY, Miami or LA, you've met, know, or are related to people like this....just not all of them at once!  The characters are very believeable, which only adds to the comedy, in a similar way the Seinfeld characters grew on us.  Coniving, selfish, lazy people--normally you'd hate at first meet--but for some reason, you can't get enough, watching them get themselves in to rediculous situations...usually because of their coniving, selfish, lazy ways!

I love night time sitcoms.  This is my favorite of all time.  It's better than Seinfeld, better than Family Guy, and if it stays on the air as long, it'll be better than the Simpsons as well.  I am so ticked off at the few negative reviews I read here on Amazon.  The 5 out of 270 that don't like the show say it's horrible.  It has no ""rewatchability"" as one reviewer put it.  ""Who are these people?"" writes another.  ""They are shallow and one-dimensional,"" insists another.  ""The plot line goes nowhere, and the characters are losers, played by washed-up actors, or actors no one has heard of.""  All of these quotes are made by ignorant idiots.  I don't know if it's even a word, but the show does have ""rewatchability.""  In fact, the plot line moves so fast sometimes (the ONLY thing I can imagine would bother someone...someone who is trying to talk on the phone, or cook dinner while they are watching) that second and third viewings reveal other, funnier situations and one-liners.  And actors?  Just look at the cast--they are all well known actors that we've all seen before, except for George-Micheal and Mae's characters, and hey--they're kids.  Another quote: ""if the father ever gets out of jail, the show is over.""  Guess what--he doesn't spend the second season in jail, and the second season is even better than the first!

I can only tell you this:  each character is well crafted, the plot is thicker and juicier than a NY Strip, and each is funnier than hell.  Almost like a David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino film, the story isn't chronological...THIS IS THE REASON I THINK THAT STUPID PEOPLE CAN'T ENJOY IT.  There are constant flashbacks and cut scenes where the narrator explains the background behind a story, situation or one-liner that just took place...like when we are told the whole story behind how Buster lost his hand.  We don't learn this until we see Buster strolling around the house breaking things with his ""hook.""  Another funny sub plot:  what each family member uses Buster's fake hand for (usually when Buster is sleeping)--the uncle uses it as a roach clip, and the mother and father use it in the sack...completely crazy!  It's so funny...laughing at a spoiled, rich, dysfunctional family!

Having the DVD is the best way to view...when you miss something funny (which does happen...you'll be laughing so hard, you'll miss entire scenes), you can pause and rewind...it's the best way to do it.  get these DVD's...this show won't be on forever.

Don't even look at the price...just buy it.  Buy all their seasons.  #2 just came out, and it's better than 1!!!",1131494400,5,3816,4.816640986132511

After only one episode, I knew that this was going to be something that I would enjoy, and after three episodes, I was completely hooked.  I watch them almost straight through, because I just can't stop... it's addicting!  The characters are all quirky and hilarious in their own ways, with Jason Bateman holding them all together.  The writing is fresh and witty, the acting is perfectly suited to the characters, and the almost reality-show type camera work make it a very unique and enjoyable series.  (Not that I am a fan of reality television at all!)  If you are in the mood for an intelligent comedy, with an excellent ensemble cast, I highly recommend Arrested Development.  Also, after you have caught up on the story, please watch the new episodes on FOX so that it can continue to be in existence.  It would be a shame to see such a remarkable show fail due to lack of an audience.  So the next time that you see a new CSI spin-off, Law and Order spin-off (nothing against them, there are just a lot of spin-offs), reality show, or celebrity who wishes to expose every incredibly lame and stupid aspect of their pathetic life in an attempt to connect to the American people show - flip through the channels, Arrested Development might just be on, and you could help ensure that it will continue to be on for years to come.",1129507200,3,1575,4.549645390070922

Recently I rented the 1st Season and went on a huge Arrested Development binge.  I have NEVER seen comedy this witty and intelligent on broadcast television.  Have I been under a rock?  Did I miss a meeting?  This sort of stuff belongs with Curb your Enthusiasm on HBO or another cable network.  It is utterly dumbfounding that FOX went ahead and took a risk on this show.

The Show is shot in a very independent free-flowing style.  No laugh tracks, no audience, and no artificially lit sets.  It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary.

It is also very refreshing to see a break from the typical sitcom character formula.  Gone are the sterotypical over-worked house wife and beer-loving pig headed white husband.  The characters in Arrested Development are REAL characters with interesting flaws and motives, albeit this has got to be the most messed up family to ever grace the screen...yes even more than the Bundys.  This coupled with some quality comedic acting, especially from David Cross, makes Arrested Development FAR above par.

Rather I mean funny that makes you jealous because you realize that the people who write this show are so much funnier than you are.  I am currently working my way through ""The Cosby Show"" season 1 and it is stunning to me how inadequate its intelligence is when stacked up against ""Arrested Development."" There are no jokes about incest or an aged movie star playing broke, or ""Gilligan's Island"" on ""The Cosby Show."" Also, any storylines that involve parents teaching kids a lesson would not involve any drug busts or the exploitation of missing body parts.  It is much more appropriate to compare this show to TV comedies that actually have a brain such as ""Soap"" (also involving a very messed up family) and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (which also has a great understanding of the power of continuity).  This show, with it's depiction of a family shaken to the core after their father and meal ticket goes to jail for some ""light treason,"" attacks the epidemic in today's society in which rich kids refuse to work a day in their life.  Take Tobias for example, he uses the money that was meant to get his medical license back to purchase acting lessons from Carl Weathers.  Of course his acting skills are utterly non-existent, but he need not worry about that for his bread has already been buttered and it's easier to pretend to be a frightened inmate than it is to actually be a doctor.  The rest of the family partakes in such stand-in professions as magician, activist, and housewife.  That is if they work at all.  When family leader and main character Michael demand that the family start earning the paychecks they pick up every week Tobias and Gob decide to start a coffee shop.  It goes without saying that they would never actually work in a coffee shop, and that is very representative of many coddled, rich kids in our country.  As a manager of a Manhattan coffee shop I have one of these children working under me.  He overuses the words existential and bourgeoisie, and constantly tells me he SHOULD be working at a university doing academic research.  But if he is so smart then why can't he figure out the virtue of punctuality? And why can't the Bluth's figure out that Carl Weathers in obviously starving, and that there lawyer is incompetent, and that Buster has been smothered beyond repair? Because they are rich not smart, and despite the lies we were told in school there is no real correlation between the two. Then again, any wealth accumulated by the writers of this show is AOK with me because they obviously used their brain to get it.  I would tell them to pass some of that intelligence on to their characters, but that wouldn't be smart, would it?  7.22 out of 10.",1128816000,10,2831,4.600397614314115
2115567,5,B0002PYS7Y,Arrested Development is the funniest show that I have ever seen.  The Bluth family makes your own family seem the greatest company you could know and that's what I love about them.  This is a character driven show and everyone in the Bluth family has their own funny quirk that makes every other scene seem outrageously hysterical.  The acting and writing talent on this show is phenomenal.  I have watched the series several times and continue to laugh out loud each time.,1128729600,2,473,4.7317073170731705
2115568,2,B0002PYS7Y,"This show does have its funny parts but the fact of the matter is it's just not entertaining enough to warrant the half an hour. It's really hard to pin-point what's actually wrong with this show. The characters are likable enough, the story is fairly witty and entertaining but the whole overall concept just doesn't gel.

It almost appears as if when casting for this show they took the cheap, safe avenue by getting a bunch of washed-up or unknown actors to star in it. To compensate for this as the series progresses they have MANY famous actors featuring on a regular basis. This is very a tricky casting technique, and this is going to hurt them in the long run. It's a very sneaky attempt to cheaply broaden their target audience by hiring the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfus from Seinfeld, Harry Winkler from Happy days, Amy Poehler from SNL to name only a few. It seems that they've tried to feature every actor in existence which starred in a successful show in a pathetic attempt to keep the ratings afloat. This isn't going to work, and you watch this series not last more than 4 seasons and it will only last that long because of Ron Howard's fat wallet.

(Review update, now it has been officially cancelled. I told you so! How much do I rule?)

I've heard some people claim this show is the new Seinfeld which is not only laughable but insulting to Jerry Seinfeld and friends. Arrested Developments downfall is the fact that the show has zero re-watchability. The episodes are more of a chore to watch at the best of times, and if you happen to come across a repeat that you've seen before you can forget about watching it again unless you like pulling teeth. That's what separates shows like this from the likes of Seinfeld; you can watch the same Seinfeld episode several times and it's still funny and entertaining. Arrested Development lacks this all important attribute, and will ultimately result in the demise of the series.

If you ever see this review Ron, and wish to save your show from certain cancellation then hit me up and I'll be happy to provide you with some advice on how to fix this show although the damage may already be done.

The conclusion to my review is that Arrested Development doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be. The story continues from week to week, but the story itself is dead with nowhere to go. If the father ever gets out of jail the shows over, if the remaining family members ever get their life sorted out the show is over. These massive plot holes result in each singular episode being totally random and nothing ever progresses. The father will always be in jail, the rest of the family will always be losers otherwise there's no show.

To sum it all up in one line, if you've seen one episode of Arrested Development you've seen them all. And just a word to the Arrested Development fans, if you have to beg people to buy this dvd to save your favourite show from being axed then you're obviously a minority and the fact that it has now been officially cancelled states this fact clearly. Too bad they didn't hire me to fix the show for them; it could of been done but due to the problems mentioned above I could tell simply by the commercials for this show even before it came on tv that it was going to be a miserable failure in it's current format.

Very predictable outcome for this show, it won't be missed...",1128643200,15,3380,4.486178861788618

Not only did I rent Season One twice, I rented it twice back-to-back (the first time for me, the second time to show it to my brother). I watched it both times, fell in love with it, and Season One became my first official DVD purchase. Huzzah!

I love the incredibly clever humor of this show. It doesn't resort to slapstick a la Three Stooges (though I love that too), it doesn't resort to sarcastic one-liners a la Friends (though I love those too). Instead, it puts the ""situational"" back into ""situational comedy"" and takes us for a wild ride.

A dysfunctional family is no doubt stressful for anyone who's a member of it, but this show strikes comedy gold in a simple truth: everyone else loves to laugh at your dysfunction. There's an undercurrent of love and loyalty between the Bluths, mainly due to Michael's efforts. But there's a strong friction as well, and the way the family members interact brings that to light.

I don't want to get into plot points and risk spoiling the surprise for those of you who haven't seen it. Suffice to say that this is the only sitcom that has managed to make me laugh so hard, I cried.

The Simpsons was really what used to hold it together, and now that the writers have completely given up on the show, so have I. Seinfeld reruns are nice, but something new was needed to revive this glowing box that once dominated my childhood.
Arrested Development is exactly the boost that television (and the genre of sitcoms in particular) needed. How good is it? Well, I've watched the entire season about 4 times over since I bought it 5 months ago. It's original, it's unpredictable, and best of all, it's funny!
As opposed to most shows on TV, where you can start watching at any point and you probably haven't missed much, Arrested Development has a story that is constantly evolving. If you miss one episode, you could possibly be lost in the next one. Even minor events can have repercussions that last the length of the season.
The characters are lovable and hilarious. Tobias and GOB are my favorite and everyone seems perfectly cast.
Just like any show, it has the occasional episode that isn't quite as good as the others, but I can't hold that against it. It raises the bar on what television should be in so many ways, that a couple of dragging episodes that help further the story can't hold it back. The second season is released in October and I have no doubt that I will pick it up the moment I have the cash.
Watch a couple episodes on TV, and although you may have no idea what's going on in the story, you should be able to get a general feel for if this is a show you want to get into.

2115592,5,B0002PYS7Y,"For a channel notorious for purchasing risky shows, then giving them no chance at all to succeed, that a show as original, quirky, and brilliant would come from Fox is a bit of a surprise. Indeed, my brother is still convinced that this is an HBO show. Arrested Development is the best show on network television, and if you're curious about whether or not you should take the plunge, I would definitely advise trying it out. A few notes--it differs from most sitcoms in that there is heavy continuity among episodes and it is very detail-oriented. Jokes are forshadowed before they appear and are evoked afterwards. The humor is sophisticated, but accessible. Some (or all) of these facts are used to say that this is a show only for ""smart"" people, whatever that means. For my part, I don't think that intelligence has anything to do with it. It's more a matter of your willingness to commit to the storylines and concentrate on what's on the tube. If you are willing to do those things, you will be rewarded. If not, you probably won't. In essence, you get what you put into it.

So, if you're willing to put some effort in, you won't be disappointed. The series revolves around the Bluth family, especially Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the voice of (mostly) reason in a family marked by petty jealousy, greed, and general cluelessness. Michael has to compete with his resentful older brother, George Oscar (or GOB, played by Will Arnett); his lipstick liberal twin sister, Lindsey (Portia de Rossi); his pathetic younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale); his is-he-or-isn't-he actor brother-in-law Tobias (David Cross); his rebellious niece, Mabee (Alia Shawkat); his judgmental and bigoted mother, Lucille (Jessica Walker); and his newly religious prison inmate father, George (Jeffrey Tambor). The only other (somewhat) normal member of his family is his son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Not only is this a flawless ensemble cast, but there are plenty of high-profile guest stars: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Liza Minelli, and Carl Weathers (playing an hilarious version of himself as a hige tightwad), to name a few. To my knowledge, it's the only time Liza Minelli and Carl Weathers have shared a scene, and if that isn't bizarre enough for you, just wait.

I am hesitant to give away any of the jokes, because my retelling would only diminish them, but take my word that this is a show where you will laugh out loud at a near-continuous clip. The only comedy it is even remotely like is Sports Night, with the same kinetic style and documentary feel. Interestingly, series creator Mitchell Hurwitz did mention Sports Night in an interview about how he put the show together. There's not quite as much good feeling in this show, which pretty much veers away from drama. However, this is the most creative and original show on the air, and Fox has given them a surprising amount of latitude. Long live Arrested Development.",1124841600,3,2923,4.91497975708502

With more than a brilliant cast, this show sports an ingenious narrator (Ron Howard), writers, directors, and anyone else involved in it's production.

In fact, it does Seinfeld one better with some of the running gags and also some of the jokes that you don't even realize are jokes until later in the season once you look back on them.  Amazing.  Why can't every show have this kind of writing?  Henry Winkler (the Fonz) plays their lawyer -- one of the absolutely most hilarious minor supporting characters of all time!  Buy it.

He did and I owe him my first born son. Every episode I ask myself 'Who writes this stuff?!'  You do need to start from episode one so you can catch all the little jokes.  But even after that you'll find yourself catching new things when you watch the episodes over and over again. And you WILL watch over and over again. I can't believe I missed this show but now I know it's here and I plan on watching religiously.  This is hands down the best show I have ever watched and that includes The Simpsons and Seinfeld.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the funniest show on TV currently, although no one is watching.

2115610,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Season One of Fox's Arrested Development is a brilliant piece of television.  The show focuses on the Bluth family who's wealthy carefree lifestyle is shattered when patriarch George Bluth (the always great Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested for defrauding his housing development company's investors.  Jason Bateman stars as Michael Bluth, the only normal and sensible family member, who must lead the company back from ruin and keep his family in check.  His mother Lucille (Jessica Walter) is an alcohol swilling schemer who won't let go of her luxurious lifestyle, his twin sister Lindsay (Portia Di Rossi) is into bizarre social causes, her husband Tobias (a hysterical David Cross) who is a former psychiatrist turned actor, his older brother GOB (Will Arnett) an illusionist, his younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) who suffers from panic attacks and still lives like a child with his mother, his son George Michael (Michael Cera) has a bizarre crush on his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat).  Michael must juggle his family's eccentric behavior, try to get information from his father in jail and raise his son.  Series executive producer Ron Howard narrates the show and his even-handed tone adds the right amount of gravity to the goofiness.  While all the supporting players are great, Mr. Bateman is the true star of the series.  His reactions to the off-the-wall behavior of his family are deadpan perfect and he shows great range.  The show was not a big hit with viewers, but the show won the Emmy for outstanding Comedy Series.",1121990400,6,1529,5.063745019920319
2115611,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Before discovering this brilliant show, I didn't really think that America was capable of producing comedy anymore on a par with Seinfeld or The Simpsons. But everything about this show, from the spot-on casting to the writing, is so perfect that you are forced to ask yourself whether you might indeed be watching the best American comedy series ever (and I'm a huge Seinfeld fan).

I urge everyone to watch it, devour it, and tell all their friends about it (as I've done). You really do need to start from the first episode though and watch them in order because there are running jokes and things that you will miss if you haven't seen previous episodes. I also think that your average person might need 3 or 4 episodes to really get into it. Once you're there though, it's one sweet ride indeed.

I mentioned the casting before, but it really is nothing short of brilliant. Even bit players like Henry Winkler as the Bluth's seriously incompetent attorney provide some of the biggest laughs of the entire series. Everyone will have their personal favourites - I love Davis Cross as Tobias and Will Arnett as Gob in particular - but it really is a true ensemble. Every character is vital to the overall success of this highly original and superbly written show. My only criticism is that I could have done with more screentime for the stew-loving Carl Weathers (now THAT is indescribably perfect casting!).

Its ratings alone should have killed it long ago but it genius -- recognized even by newtork types -- has allowed it to persevere.  This is a perfectly cast ensemble show about a very dysfunctional family.  Its the kind of show where so much happens that episodes don't weaken with repeated viewing.  In fact, there's so much detail in them that repeated viewing enhance the experience.  That may be part of the problem with the show's ratings: many people may not be able to keep up with it when they see it on a weekly basis.  Here's where the DVD's come into play: the show works far better watching 2 or 3 episodes in a row.

It's got to be the funniest comedy out there, but I can understand why it doesn't get huge ratings.  You have to watch them in order, there's a continuity to the episodes.  If you watch an episode tonight on tv it will be hysterical, but you'll also get the feeling that you're missing part of the story.

And that's why the dvd set is so perfect. The writing is terrific and complex; there's not one storyline per episode, there's often three or four.  They intertwine to become some hysterical mess by the end of the episode.  Every actor on this show delivers fantastic performances, their characters are so hysterical!

I feel bad because I have not watched the second season, I've been waiting for the box set.  But thankfully it has been renewed for the third season, and getting it renewed was too close to the wire.

Therefore I am begging people to set their tvs on this show, let it get the ratings it needs to continue.  It is the smartest and funniest show on tv, and needs our help.  Buy the dvd set and watch it this fall!",1121299200,,1198,4.420091324200913

All I can say is, thank the powers that be that they renewed this for  a third season. Jason Bateman is absolutely great and deserved his Golden Globe for his work on this show....far cry from Teen Wolf Too. Will Arnett is wonderful as Bateman's older brother George, who aspires to be a magician, but who has no talent. And I'm not a fan of David Cross, but he is good here as the brother-in-law who has a phobia about being naked, calling himself a ""no-nude."" The rest of the cast is equally as funny and droll, and the show works so well because they're all so good.

A few great quotes:

Lucille: Oh, George, I should have never doubted you. Even when you slept with my sister it was for a good reason.

George Sr.: Got her to stop drinking, didn't it?

Michael Bluth: [calling from prison, taking about his brother, Gob] I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it.

Lucille: You would do that to your brother?

Michael Bluth: I said ""cot"".

Buster: Mom is becoming a little controlling.

Michael: What tipped you off? When she locked you out on the balcony again?

Buster: That was half my fault. I thought I saw a graham cracker out there.

Michael: You baited the balcony?

Lucille Bluth: Prove it.

Starring Jason Bateman (you may recognize him as the fat kid from Stand By Me), it is a hilarious story about what happens to the wealthy Bluth family after it's patriarch is arrested. With wacky characters like his outrageous mother who is far too acustomed to being rich, his idiot brother the magician, and his sister (who doesn't understand the real world) as well as he never-nude husband and rebellious teenage daughter who is constantly tempting Michael's son, it's hard to keep a straight face.

I have to say that I think this is one of the funniest (not stomach hurting laughter, but ironic quirky laughter) television shows that I have seen in my adult life. It gives me odd memories of the old show Soap, which I recall watching when I was very young, and way too young to appreciate it.

The writing is excellent, the acting is superb (happy to see Jason again!) and the narration by Ron Howard is like the icing on the cake. This is definitely an adult show, and bravo to Fox and company for bringing it back for Season 3.

2115622,5,B0002PYS7Y,"It is difficult to express exactly how funny 'Arrested Development' is.

First, the cast is amazing.  Jason Bateman is the perfect deadpan center of the action.  He is surrounded by some of the best actors working in series television.  Some, like Jeffery Tambor, I knew going in from his brilliant turn on 'The Larry Sanders Show'.  Others are totally new, but they are all equally talented.  Each character is totally distinct with their own set of quirks.

Second, the writing is amazing.  The humor of the show grows as it goes along.  This makes a show that really pays off committed viewing.  The characters are effected by the events of prior episodes and react in unexpected ways.  By the tenth episode, you laughing harder at these 'inside' jokes than you are to more obvious ones.  It plays out that way from episode to episode.  Like 'Seinfeld' a given episode is carried through more often by a theme than single plot line.  That gives the large cast some room to breathe.  Everyone does not have to be in the same room at the same time.

Third, the Newport Beach setting is sort of fresh.  It is nice to see parts of Southern California that have not been recycled 100 times.

Fourth, the one camera and no laugh track thing is a lot less cheesy than the standard three camera sitcom.  For one thing, it allows the story to move around a little more.  That also allows the writers to keep the gags fresh by putting them in different settings.

Fifth, it is a show well served by digital technology.  DVD (or TiVo) allow the viewer to rewind to catch a bit of dialouge, or pause just to avoid laughing over the next two jokes.",1118966400,,1638,4.51877133105802

Most good clever/witty comedies get this smile or slight chuckle reaction out of me (""Seinfeld"" and ""The Simpsons"" come to mind). ""Arrested Development"" is the only show that I have ever watched that consistently makes me laugh out loud during almost every episode. I have actually cried with laughter on several occasions while watching this show. One such instance was last night while watching the episode ""Bringing Up Buster"" from Disc 1 of this 1st season. I don't know why, but it just kills me when Buster starts cussing and it's just one long ""BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."" ""Well, no one's going to top that."" Man I'm almost crying just writing about it.

I realize that humor is quite subjective, but everyone that I introduce to this show has LOVED it. I know some people have been complaining that the 2nd season isn't as good, but I have to disagree. The 2nd season is right on par with the first and I'll be buying that DVD as soon as it comes out too. I loved watching this show from the first airing of the Pilot and have watched it ever since. Now that I have finally purchased the DVD of the first season, I can go back and laugh until it hurts all over again.

You try to get them involved in the conversation as they sit alone not saying a word with a look of awkwardness on their face.  Your friends and you have an intimate relationship that span many years and you shared many experiences and laughs that anybody entering your conversation would be intimidated.

Arrested Development isn't trying to occupy your life for a half hour every week; it is trying to be one of your close friends.  It wants you to share in the subtlety of a one word joke that will have your side hurting from laughing so hard because you have been friends for awhile and have experienced a lot together.  It is not a sitcom or a business model; it is a real live person.  You could never explain to another person the story behind a photo and have them laugh as hard when they see that picture you have of the girl in the ""Slut"" t-shirt.

Fans of AD are not pretentious people; we are just close friends with the show.  It is a relationship that may have begun as casual acquaintances, but it grew to where it is now: solid as a rock.

Jason Bateman's work is surprisingly excellent and crucial towards grounding the rest of the loopy family members (all of them great as well) in something resembling reality, unlike much of the slapstick nonsense in other sitcoms today. Arrested Development is great stuff! Take a cue from Fox and give it a chance today! And if you already love it, for God's sake buy this for a friend or loved one!",1116633600,,948,4.58235294117647

I was able to catch a number of episodes that I had originally missed, which allowed me to catch some earlier references to some Season 2 running themes like Steve Holt! and the Corn Baller. Every time I re-watch an episode I catch a joke or gag that I had missed before, or a reference to something from an earlier or later episode. This show is by far the best comedy on TV (cable or network), and probably one of the best comedies of all time. My recommendation: 1. Buy this DVD and watch every single episode. 2. If you haven't been already watch the show on Fox. 3. Buy Season 2 when it comes out.

Although the ratings of the show are low, its sustainability may depend on its DVD sales.

I've been a diehard Simpsons fan for 15 years, but a funny thing happened to me this year...I realized that the show I most looked forward to on Sunday nights wasn't the Simpsons (which, I admit, isn't as good as it once was), but rather the show immediately following it on Fox, Arrested Development.  The more I watch this show, the more I realize how brilliant and groundbreaking it is--I will even go out on a limb and say it's better than Seinfeld.

If I had to compare Arrested Development to another show, I would say it's the Simpsons in its heyday shot in the style of a Christopher Guest mockumentary.  Like the Simpsons, it features a family that is completely dysfunctional yet surprisingly full of heart, and every episode is crammed with freeze-frame fun and hilarious pop culture references; like a Christopher Guest movie, the cast is fiercely committed to their characters and plays the wacky humor in a completely straight-faced manner.  Everyone on the show is fantastic, but I have to give special credit to Jason Bateman, who redefines the role of the comedy straight man, Jessica Walter, who is uncompromisingly bitchy as the family matriarch, and Michael Cera, who plays the bewildered teenage George Michael and who at the age of 16 may be the best comedic actor on television today.  And I don't even know what to say about Will Arnett as GOB.  You'll just have to watch.

Much like last spring, the show is teetering on the brink of cancellation because of low ratings, and the fans are mystified by the inability of this brilliantly funny show to find an audience.  Granted, AD can be a hard show to get into--it's fast paced, the plots are complex, and there's a lot of self-referential humor--but buying the DVDs is a great way to get into it.*  Fans agree...give it three episodes and we guarantee you will be hooked for life.  Buying the DVDs also gives you the added bonus of being able to catch the sight gags and one-liners you missed the first time you watched because you were laughing so hard.  Finally, the better the DVD sales, the better the chances that this incredible show will be back for a third season, and the more gratitude you will receive from all of us devoted fans.

2115645,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Hey brothers!

OK, the funniest comedy EVER?  I know what you're thinking - things aren't the best ever these days.  The best ever is something that always happened a very long time ago, back in the good ol' days, right?

After just two seasons on television, Arrested Development is the best comedy in the history of the boob tube.

Of course, ""best"" can't be quantified, and preference is subjective.  And there are plenty of folks who have watched this show and not cared for it.  And I've noticed - if you feel that ""the Simple Life"" is quality television, this show isn't for you.  If you have attention deficit disorder you might have trouble following the continuing plots and running gags, but believe me, a twelve year old could catch up in half an hour.

So, the show isn't for everyone.  In fact, maybe quite a few people have surfed by AD on a Sunday night, given it five minutes, and passed.  If you belong to this group, slow down.  Give it an episode, maybe two.  You won't start to ""kinda"" like it - you'll fall in love with it, you'll start fiending for another AD fix.  You'll find yourself laughing in public for what appears to be no reason, but you won't care what others think, because you've acheived true enlightenment.

I'll leave the details to the many, many excellent reviews already available here at Amazon.  The best deadpan ever recorded, a perfect cast, and the writing.... the concept in general.  It's perfect, and the reviews are unanimous.

So pick up this DVD set - $30 is nothing, considering how many time's you're going to watch each episode.  And the next time you see someone laughing to himself, for no apparent reason, you'll understand why.  Save yourself, save Arrested Development - don't make a huge mistake.",1114128000,8,1757,4.6612377850162865

ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT begins at George Bluth Sr.'s retirement party that takes place on a yacht. He is set to announce the heir to his company. His middle son, Michael, whole-heartedly believes he will be picked by his father. He even acts as if he knows he will be picked. When George Bluth Sr. is about to announce his predecessor, he decides to start off with a description of them. The description begins with the norm, and Michael grows more anxious with every word. Suddenly, George Sr.'s words to describe his predecessor become ""the sexiest person I know."" Confused by his father's choice of words to describe him with, Michael witnesses as the job is passed on to George Sr.'s wife, Lucille.

Michael is torn inside. Then the police come to arrest his father, for using the company's money as ""his own personal piggy bank.""

Part of why ARRESTED is so great is the brilliant characters, all played to perfection by their actors. Leading off the cast is Michael Bluth, played by Jason Batman, he seems to be the only sane one in the family. In fact he IS the only sane one in the family. When the Bluth family assets are frozen, he is the only one that can recognize the seriousness of the problem. Everyone else in the family can't seem to be able to stop spending money, even when it isn't theirs.

His father, George Sr., is head of the Bluth Company, and besides doing the crimes that he was charged with during the initial arrest, he might have committed some ""light"" treason. Look for scenes where Michael notices similarities with model houses in Iraq and his, and also look for when George Sr. regards a box marked ""H. Maddas."" It won't seem like anything important at the time, in fact it's made to look so unimportant at the time you may miss it completely, but the truth will unveil itself in the last episode of season 1.

Michael's mother, Lucille, is best described as what Michael and his siblings playfully call her: ""a horrible mother"" and ""old thing."" She has a bad habit of pampering her youngest son, Buster, except for when she gets angry with him, and she'll take that anger so far as to adopt a child from Korea just to show Buster up (she even enlists Buster in the army in season 2).

Michael's older brother, George Oscar Bluth, who is referred to as ""GOB"" (jobe) is a charming though messed up magician, who started a group called the ""Magician's Alliance"" that punishes magicians for revealing their secret. He is kicked out of the Alliance that he started when it is reported on the news that he tried to hide his father in one of his magic show props in which people are supposed to disappear. The newscaster proceeds to reveal the secret behind the trick.

Michael's twin sister, Lindsay, used to be a major demonstrator, but now just buys things with money that's not hers and pretends to care so not to look bad. She's a bit over-confident about her looks.

Michael's younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth is perhaps the most sheltered child in history, and has no idea what the real world is like-and now he's over twenty. He's a momma's boy, to the end. In one scene, when Michael and GOB are talking about how evil their mom Lucille is, Buster adds his opinion in the conversation with ""Yeah, isn't mom great?"" He's a warning sign for all parents not willing to let go of their child.

Michael's twin sister Lindsay's husband, Tobias, is also a major demonstrator which is the reason why he and Lindsay met and why she fell in love with him. Now she's not really in love with him. And methinks Tobias is somewhat gay. He always seems to get involved with the gay crowed, like when he writes a book called ""The Man inside Me"" in which, in order to ""avoid confusion"" he makes all the gender pronouns masculine. He and Lindsay have indeed had some marital problems, and have agreed to see other people, while still seeing each other when they crawl in bed (and that even comes to a stop). Tobias is also a ""never-nude."" Which is exactly what it sounds like-he's never nude.

Michael's son, George-Michael, isn't exactly sheltered, but something like it. To avoid having the Bluth family add another disgrace to the world, Michael tries his best not to corrupt George-Michael's heart. This goes to such an extent that George-Michael, now in his teens, is pretty much a light-hearted moron with a crush on his cousin (that subsides in season 2 when he starts to date the notoriously dull ""Ann"").

Who is George-Michael's cousin? That would be Lindsay and Tobias' rebel daughter Maeby, whose goal in life is to do exactly the opposite of whatever her parents do. She provides a pretty good contrast to the do-gooder George-Michael.

The writing in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is some of, if not THE, best writing in a sitcom. The characters are more twisted and vibrant than in pretty much every other show on Earth. The humorous narration by the former ANDY GRIFFITH and HAPPY DAYS star Ron Howard provides passages from scene to scene, often so funny that he steals the spotlight from the actors, especially in the ""On the next ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"" bits.

Overall, I'd have to say ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT may be the greatest sitcom of all time, at least top five. The small amount of viewers in no way relates to the amount of laughs, and if you haven't started watching yet, I urge you to start! Spectacular!",1113264000,8,5346,4.638477801268499

I thought that I would never see a show that works on as many levels as The Simpsons did.  I admire how the show could have such broad comedy and such nuances, often in the same joke.  However, as wonderful as The Simpsons was, Arrested Development has eclipsed my wildest imagination of what a comedy could be.  I have never seen a TV show be so consistently funny.  If one were to compile a list of the 22 greatest episodes of TV ever, I would happily compare them to the 22 episodes of Arrested Development Season One and I would contend that the latter group is better.  Furthermore, never has such an amazing group of actors been assembled on one program.  Each actor is perfect in his or her role.  I was watching a program over the weekend counting down the 100 best TV show characters of all time.  If Arrested Development remains on the air for a few more seasons, I predict that the entire Bluth clan will wind up in the top ten.

2115659,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Arrested Development is my favorite comedy show next to Seinfeld, one of the greatest shows known to man (in my opinion).  That's saying a lot!  The way its sarcasm and stupidity is put together makes it a truly brilliant show.

  I am extremely disheartened that this show MAY be cancelled (very strong emphasis on the MAY).  If it is cancelled, I would probably lose my faith in the success of the human race.  I was introduced to the show by my brother when he showed me the DVD.  After watching the first episode, I finished the entire season in 4 days.  This is a must-get DVD.  I wish i knew about the show earlier.

  Finally in response to the 3 deranged maniacs who rated the DVD with 1 star, ""You are either deaf, blind or just stupid!""

2115660,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This is the story of the Bluth family, a once-prominent group of individuals who now have to try to live a more frugal life after George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) was arrested for shady bookkeeping (along with a few other charges).  This forces George's son Michael (Jason Bateman), who was planning on leaving the family's development business after being passed up for a promotion, to take over the company.  Michael is the natural choice seeing as how his mother Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walters) is a narcissistic and critical socialite, his twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke (Portia de Rossi) has never worked more than a day in her life, his older brother George Oscar Bluth, Jr. (Will Arnett), or just Gob for short (pronounced Jobe), is a lazy (and inept) magician, and his younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth (Tony Hale), is a moderately intelligent mama's boy who is prone to panic attacks.  Rounding out the cast are Tobias Funke (David Cross), Lindsay's husband, whom she married in order to rebel against her father, George-Michael Bluth (Michael Cera), Michael's son, and Mae ""Maeby"" Funke (Alia Shawkat), Michael's niece.  Oh, and Ron Howard narrates the show.

Arrested Development is shot as a mockumentary, which, in my opinion, is a stroke of genius for this show, because it allows things such as dramatic and situational irony to be used in new ways.  It also adds a lot of humor when the characters refer to things, and ""archive footage"" is inserted (or in some cases, it says ""Footage Not Found"").

This is a very different kind of comedy than something like The Simpsons or Seinfeld.  It doesn't revolve around punchlines and their set-up; rather, things happen as they would in real life, only the events in this show are a lot more humorous.  Furthermore, unlike many other comedy shows, the episodes are serialized, meaning that actions in one episode carry over into the next.  In fact, there are subtle hints in many episodes that allude to something that happens in the finale.  And one of the funniest things is that at the end of most episodes, there is a segment where scenes from the next episode are shown.  99% of the time, the scenes don't actually show up, but they fit in with the show's continuity.

The characters are extremely developed, and their individual idiosyncrasies are hilarious.  For example, Gob is a crappy magician who thinks that he is the next Houdini.  Unfortunately, his tricks either fail miserably or work too well!  He also thinks that he's much more responsible than he really is.  Lindsay is a woman who loves to get involved with charitable causes... because she likes throwing parties to raise money (one of my favorite was the anti-circumcision group called HOOP; I'll let you figure out what the acronym meant).  And her daughter Maeby often rebels against the causes Lindsay joins, for the sole purpose of rebelling.

The guest stars on the show are great as well.  Henry Winkler plays Barry Zuckerkorn, George Sr.'s extremely incompetent attorney who has his own share of legal problems (he actually reminds me a bit of Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons).  Judy Greer plays George's secretary Kitty Sanchez, who is a hypersexual, partygoing, cute-in-a-goofy-way girl who had an affair with George, and thus is in a position of power of Michael (she knows where some incriminating evidence is).  Buster gets a love interest in the form of Lucille Austero (Liza Minelli, who I hate to admit is perfect for the role).  Lucille Austero (AKA Lucille 2) is best friends/social rivals with Lucille Bluth, and it causes a lot of tension between Lucille 1 and Buster, who, as Michael points out, is still attached to his mother's umbilical cord.  And then there is Annyong (Justin Lee), a young Korean boy that Lucille accidentally adopted when Buster was misbehaving one day.  Annyong (which is actually Korean for ""Hello"") and Buster find themselves fighting for Lucille's affection (not that she has much to give) in some very hilarious ways.

I can't believe I didn't get into this show sooner; it is one of the funniest comedies that I have ever seen.  Sadly though, it may not be renewed for a third season (it almost didn't get a second, but it won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, so FOX gave it a second chance).  And sadly, I can kind of understand why its ratings are so low.  As I said, it is serialized, and while its easier to jump into midseason than shows like 24 or Alias, it is a show that you have to see a few episodes of in order to fully enjoy it.

I have now ""ruined"" people's days by showing them one or two episodes off the dvd, and they get so addicted they spend an entire afternoon watching the DVD instead of doing anything else.  Its the most addictive show in my opinion on television, which for being a comedy is extremely rare.  Its a show with not just great laughs, but a lot of heart and the characters are truly human and relatable, not single dimension characters who never grow or change.  In regards to Season 2, this season is much more down to earth, mostly because it spends much of the time establishing and developing the relationships between the characters and getting the viewer used to their eccentricities and quirks.  Season 2 is great as well, but relies a lot on the viewer already understanding these quirks.  Therefore, this DVD is perfect for the newcomer and Arrested Development veteran alike, as no matter how many times you watch it you pick up something new in the episodes, and learn more about the characters.  The bonus features are great, and the hidden easter egg is very ""revealing"".  I received both this DVD and the Seinfeld DVDs for Christmas, and my Seinfeld DVDs are gathering dust, though Seinfeld was one of my favorite shows of all time.  That should tell you how good this show is.  I now make it a point to show this DVD to everyone I know, and after watching a few episodes I have no doubt that you will too.

Arrested Development, minute-for-minute, packs more jokes than any single episode of Seinfeld or The Larry Sanders Show. I'd compare it favorably to the late, classic Soap on many levels. Right now I'm hoping that it can avoid the pitfalls Soap fell into and maintain its current quality. Although for the life of me I can't imagine how they can keep it this good.

The writing is insanely clever and the actors who inhabit the characters are like an ensemble cast made in heaven. Gob and Buster literally make me double over, Jason Bateman gives the best deadpan deliveries, Jeffrey TAmbor is a genius.....and the story lines!

The humor is found through the absurd story arcs of the characters as the season plays out. The story really does progress from episode to episode and in many ways the complexity of the story could be used for a soap opera, but in this case it's used for very intelligent and sharp humor.  Sometimes the funniest gags are the ones that are running ones and there are a few hilarious ones.  The best thing about this show is that it's all about behavior and there really aren't jokes, which makes it hard to explain funny situations to friends of yours, but are hilarious nonetheless.

Without a laugh track the show can move along at a quick pace with so many things, subtle and not so subtle, going on all around this family.

Regardless of whether you rate this as the ""all-time best show"" or not, it is definitely worth the price to watch the 22 episodes. I watch them again and again to see what I may have missed previously.

The characters are so well played by the actors that the ensemble just wouldn't be the same without any one of them. The characters are not the type that you ""relate"" to because it is truly fiction. That is what makes it funny!

And no laugh track!  Like I said, brilliant.  If only more  television took the same risks.  There is no sitcom formula here... it is totally fresh!

This is the type of show that we should be embracing...and in its time slot just after The Simpsons, you'd think there wouldn't be a problem finding a substancial audience. So, what is the problem? Why are we threaened with the possibility of cancellation of a show that, given a chance to grow and nurture, could well be the Seinfeld of its generation?

The answer lies in the fact that the viewership out there is not sophisticated enough, so forcefed they are on ""reality"" TV that they wouldn't know a great comedy if it jumped up and bit them on the...

Hey now! (Sorry, wrong show). I was a skeptic when I first heard about this show...but once hooked, I went out and bought the DVD set as soon as it became available.

Why? Because the show is FUNNY. It makes fun of all of the things we think about the rich and does it in a way that also makes us think, ""I guess this could happen...maybe...?""

The characters on the show are all wonderful in their own quirky ways. Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth is supposed to be the glue that holds this disfunctional family together, playing it straight faced even though he seems at times to be the most disfunctional of them all. Will Arnett is brilliant as Gob, the brother who'd like to have it all, but doesn't want to work for it...and possibly the worst magician in creation. David Cross as Tobias and Portia de Rossi as Lindsay, the most confusing couple on television, and the support of all of the characters, especially Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr. makes this an ensemble not seen in a long time...everyone is well defined and different in their foibles. And add the likes of Liza Minelli and Julia Louis Dreyfuss (ah, the Seinfeld connection) to the mix and you have a briallian array of stars and guest stars.

Highlights, well, all of the shows, really, but personal favorites include, in no particular order:

1. Pilot

2. Top Banana

3. Key Decisions

4. Pier Pressure

5. Beef Consomme

6. Shock And Aww

7. Altar Egos

8. Justice Is Blind

9. Best Man For The Gob

10. Not Without My Daughter

Let me just say that this show possibly rivals Seinfeld. I've always been a Jason Bateman fan since his early days and a couple unknown sitcom attempts which nobody probably remembers, and his straight delivery as the only sane person in this insane family is perfect.

The casting is wonderful; there's Portia DeRossi's troubled twin sister who starts a non-profit with her brother and husband as board members, files permits with city and state, and all the paperwork just so she can donate an expensive gown to a thrift store, write it off, but then go back and buy the dress again at a severe discount -- therefore getting away with the purchase of a designer gown which her brother, who controls the family's finances, told her not to buy. [gasp]

My favorite character, though, is Tobias, the ""never-nude"" who loses his medical liscense and decides to become an actor after accidentally finding himself among a troupe of gay performers protesting his father-in-law's construction business, and becomes inspired.

2115680,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Much has been said about Arrested Development. Many critics lauding this innovative series, wildly inventive, you have to see this show. However, this hype kept me away from this show. In reading about it, nothing seemed to appeal to me, nothing reached out and said, ""watch this"". But then, came the DVD, and on a whim, I thought I'd try it.

Simply put:

I haven't laughed this hard, out loud,  at a comedy television show in years.

Arrested Development is a tour de force of comedy. It starts with the writing, which is, bar none, the finest in all of television land. In the creation of the Bluths, a narcissistic, troubled, and yet somehow endearing, family, we have a group of people that are both grounded and crazy at the same time. The characters are strong, fresh. The plotlines totally unconceivable and yet real. The writing is A+.

Then, the actors. To pull off this craziness, you need a group of people, who buy into the vision and manage to make it real. Who would have thought that Jason Bateman could be the center of this insanity and pull it off with great talent? Portia de Rossi as a clueless socialite? Jeffrey Tambor's adjustment to prison life? All of the people turn in such classic work that they all deserve Emmys for incredible performances.

Rumor has it that Fox is cutting the second second of this show short. Sure, create a visionary, ground breaking television show, and clip its wings before it truly takes flight. Had that happened to other shows in their infancy, we wouldn't have spent a decade with Seinfeld and Cheers. I implore the channel to reconsider their decision, and give Arrested Development a chance to breathe. And I implore anyone reading this reivew to click your easy ""one click"" button and order this classic. You'll be laughing so hard, you're sides will hurt!",1109116800,8,1818,4.719242902208202
2115681,4,B0002PYS7Y,"While this is not the greatest comedic ever produced for television it is quite funny.  First it must be said that Arrested Development is much better than Curb Your Enthusiasm, a lot cleaner also.  The show centers around a son who has taken control of his family's company because his dad's corruption and fraud, the father is in prison.  The entire family is dysfunctional in ways you will be unable to imagine.

Buster is one of the funniest characters on the episode.  He is perpetually babied by his mother and is a victim of frequent panick attacks.  Also I like the character George Michael whose relationship with his cousin is one of the funniest recurring themes.  The writing and situations are great for television viewing and this is one of the few television shows which is definitely worth watching.",1108771200,4,815,4.820143884892087
2115682,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Unfortunately, there is no intelligence channel (I-TV).  If such a channel existed, then AD could remain on the air, Scrubs would have remained funny, Mr. Show would be on its umpteenth season, and people would only admit to seasons 2-9 of the Simpsons actually existing.

I knew that AD would have a short run from the very first episode.  Some of the characters are politically incorrect, the humor is delivered in brilliant Super Troopers style, and the family sometimes learns a small lesson.  The average viewer wants his/her humor blended and fed to them through a straw--evidence comes in the form of a ""laugh now, please"" laughtrack.

Each character in this show has his or her own perfect quirks.  George Michael is unbelievably uncomfortable at any time, GOB is likeable due to his unlikeability (word?), and Michael is the dependable great guy with few character flaws and a massive conscience.  Nothing that any of the characters does or says is inconsistant with their persona, and Michael has enough family values to carry the entire Bluth tribe.

I've been through this box set 8 times, and there seems to be no sign of slowing down.  I derive great joy from introducing more people to this work of comedic art.

2115684,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This show is currently the best comedy on TV; if you haven't been watching, this DVD set will prove why you should be.  It's very original and difficult to describe; the humor ranges from satirical to absurdist to obscure cultural references to slapstick to offensive, all in the same episode.  The story of a wealthy family's undoing due to illegal business practices makes for great comedy, as does the utterly dysfunctional family dynamic between all the characters.  Each character has their own quirks and motivations, and all are extremely well written and very well acted.

It's important to watch these in order, because the storylines do continue, and previous episodes and jokes are referenced in later shows.

This DVD set has a lot of great extras, like the commentaries and the featurette.  A lot of extras for just the one season, so it's definitely worth it.

This show is the only comedy on network TV that consistently makes me laugh out loud more than once every time I watch it.  Even though it's won Emmys and has always gotten critical acclaim, it's still in danger of being cancelled.

Since buying these in late October, I've seen every episode and avidly watch the show each week.

This is by far the best show on TV today.  The writing is amazingly witty and the free roaming camera shots are great.  Each character relates perfectly within the setting they're in.  This type of chemistry and hilarious story lines haven't been around since Seinfeld.

The one thing about this series, and this is both good and bad, is the episodes make much more sense when seen in order.  The reason I loved the series after I saw it in order was because I understood the little running gags throughout.

That is, in fact, exactly what the characters are but I realized, after the first two or three failed attempts to get into the show, they're pretty damn hilarious.

As in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" coincidence trips over confusion; and no good deed goes unpunished; and you really can see some of the punchlines coming from a mile away -- but it still works for me, mostly because of the show's ""Simpson""-esque way of cutting away to little asides and flashbacks.  I'd definitely say ""AD"" is more Simpsonian than Davidian.

I also like how no good joke ever truly goes away -- the stair truck keeps reappearing, George Michael's crush pops up again and again and there's always that prison guard shouting, ""No touching!"" at just the right moments.

It's good to see Jason Bateman again, too.  If you watched the short-lived Bateman-as-junior-con-man sitcom ""It's Your Move"" growing up, it's a kick to see Bateman as a frazzled dad just trying to do the right thing.

And, despite it's jokey trappings, the show actually does play around with the themes of communication and compromise - information passes from sibling to parents to sibling and often becomes warped during the transition, and there's a price tag dangling from every favor.",1107561600,4,1486,5.016260162601626

With all the typical (and unfunny) family sitcoms available, it is such a breath of fresh air to have a smart, creative, and hilariously funny show to watch.  Arrested Development is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and it will still be funny, if not funnier every time.  It is obvious that a lot of time is spent to make this show so clever and humorous.  All the characters have depth and personality and after you watch a few episodes you feel like you know each and every wacky one of them.

There is so much detail that goes into the dialogue, sets, and music, among other things.  Every time I watch an episode I see some new minor detail that makes me laugh out loud.  It seems like the show uses a lot of improvisation but there isn't, which really says a great deal about the writing and the acting.  That they can make it so smooth and realistic that is doesn't even seem like they are following a script.  Terrific ensemble acting, state of the art camera shooting and outlandish story lines are what make this comedy stand above the other comedies on television now!  Quality television at it's best!!

I hope this show stays on the air for many, many years to come and more networks will recognize that we need more shows of this caliber on television today.  I highly recommend the show and the DVD to watch anytime you want to laugh.

It might have taken more than one episode, but I love this show. I also hope that the show finds a bigger audience now because there have always been rumors that FOX will cancel the show. It would be an outrage if they would cancel (in my opinion) the only good comedy show on TV today.

Between all the old, trite, boring sitcoms on TV right now, Arrested Development is genuine comedy.",1106870400,2,864,4.320987654320987
2115694,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I saw the advertisments for the first show. It looked pretty funny about the father who didn't want to get out of jail(was having the time of his life).After seeing the pilot I have been hooked ever since. I love the humor. It's such a relief to see something other than slapstick pie in your face humor.

  It's a wonder it's doing as good as it is. Fox has been running specials in it's place so it's hard to get a regular audience. It's humor isn't for everyone, (but then what humor is?).

  I received the 1st season on DVD and have watched it over and over. I have never watched a comedy this much. I think the first season was great and the second hasn't been as good but I think it will pick up.

  I'm a big Ron Howard fan. I can usually count on his stuff to be what I like. I hope it stays on a long time. I know where I will be every Sunday at 8:30. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD or at least watch an episode or two.",1106870400,2,935,3.9308510638297873
2115695,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I should be studying for finals tomorrow, but I would rather review AD.  It seems that a lot of the people on here love this show.  I think it's funny because many of these reviewers didn't originally like the show or saw it on tv by accident and started wathing it, which puts a smile in my heart.  My story is very similar.  I saw about five minutes of one of the first episodes on tv and didn't like it.  Then I heard it won Emmy for Best Comedy, and since I am a lover of comedy, I thought ""Well I should at least try it out because I wouldn't want to miss out watching a great television program"".  So I watched an episode from the second season a few months after seeing that one episode from the first season and thought ""Meh"".  But I did like how the episode all came together at the end like a good comedy should.  I wanted to keep watching it, though and the next episode was one of the greatest pieces of writing I've ever seen.  After seeing only two episodes, I borrowed the disc 3 dvd from a friend who rented it, and watched the episode ""Let Them Eat Cake"".  I wasn't even sure if I really liked it that much, but the show just grabbed me and sucked me in.  After seeing only 3 episodes I knew I had to have these dvds so I put them on my Christmas list.  Hooray!  When I opened it Christmas morning I watched it and over the next few days finished the entire season.  Now I love the show.  I even put it in my five greatest shows of all time, which consists of Seinfeld, The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and Arrested Development.  I love Gob, George Michael, and Michael.  The show is perfect and I want to watch The Office, since that's supposedly, from what I heard, a show crafted the same way as Arrested Development.

Now for the second part of my ""Arrested Development Rules"" ""essay"", I want to just say that TG2 from Virginia, the reviewer about 3 reviews below me doesn't know what he/she is talking about.  Obviously if 3 people give the show a 1 star, 6 people give it a 4, and over 110 give it a 5, the people who gave it a 5 or 4 aren't wrong, you are.  You are outnumbered like 120-3.  How could you be right?  I suppose you just don't get it and that's okay.  Maybe when you're older.  Enjoy the dvd everbody!",1106784000,,2244,4.141203703703703
2115696,5,B0002PYS7Y,I watched the first season of Arrested Development when it was on the television. Then I watched the reruns of it. Then I got this DVD set and watched all the episodes again. Now I'm looking forward to watching them on the DVDs again. They are just that entertaining. It's a rare occasion when you find yourself laughing out loud to every single joke. There is just too much to say about this show. It ties NewsRadio and the old Letterman show as my favorite tv shows of all time. Hurry up and finish the second season so I can buy the DVDs!,1106697600,,541,4.262135922330097
2115697,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I just got this on DVD a month ago and have watched the entire series twice already!  The word hilarious doesn't even begin to describe the funniest TV show I've seen in a looong time!

The cast (with possibly the minor exception of Portia de Rossi who I think could be better) is amazing.  Special attention goes to Will Arnett as the cocky, ridiculous but deep down sensitive and eager-to-please Gob (I love his magician poses and the way he mocks Copperfield), Jessica Walters, who makes bad parenting look good, Henry Winkler, in his best role ever, Tony Hale (how can you not love Buster?) and of course, Jason Bateman who proved that he had a lot more to offer than Hogan's Heroes.  His dry wit and clever one-liners are great and he's the stable center of the entire show.  Jeffrey Tambor, David Cross (who finally got a role suited for him), Michael Cera and Alia Shakwat fill out the rest of what is undoubtedly the best cast on television.

The deleted scenes (in the extras section) are just as hilarious and make you wish the show was a full hour so everything could stay in.  Can't wait to see what the second season has in store!  I'm hoping they get rid of Anyang, though, that joke was funny until he learned English.  And more of Carl Weathers (what is with his obsession with stew?), Liza Minnelli, Henry Winkler, Kitty, and the Hot Cops!",1106697600,,1356,4.524590163934426
2115698,1,B0002PYS7Y,"That word? ""Dead""

I skimmed through 60 of the 117 reviews at the time of this writing, including someone that rated 1 star because they received the musical group Arrested Development when they wanted this fox show.

And I'm really at a loss... how can 116 people be so wrong about a television show?  It becomes obvious to me that mass hysteria has an equally disturbing and opposite force, namely amassed brain dead zombies that have this love of dead - deadpan.

I've forced myself through the first four shows, I never laughed, found the entire 3rd person narration to get on my nerves worse than the feelings of wasted time, I see the ""highlight"" clips that are supposed to entice people to watch the show and even still find myself angered that ANYONE could honestly say they find the show funny.

You want something funny.. go for Brain Donors, or Family Guy, or even the practicality of the funny shows like, The Simpsons, Malcolm in the Middle, or the outrageousness of Soap, anything but this show... I mean even the Brady Bunch had more punch line than arrested development.

But obviously, 116 of you would sell your soul for this type of program so have at it.  Just stop wasting space on the Amazon servers for your constant dirge of love for the show.. please.. and go write for something better on DVD.. you've got skills.. use them for the greater good.. and that's not Arrested Development!

If there were a zero star rating Arrested Development should find itself in the slammer with it.",1106697600,24,1507,4.660377358490566
2115699,5,B0002PYS7Y,"No, there is NOTHING like it on network television.  No, there is NOTHING like it on cable broadcast.  And no, this is not another one of Fox's desperate attempts to gain ratings outside of ""The Simpsons"" by appealing to a mature audience.  This show is SO far from [mature] that it's a wonder it didn't end up on late-afternoon PBS, flanked by Seasame Street and Arthur The Aardvark.

From the extended pilot to the last episode, this show leaves little to be desired.  The most discernable episodes, from ""Top Banana"" (""You mailed that insurance check, right Gob?"") to ""Not Without My Daughter"" (""Well, they expect a certain amount of theft, Michael. It's built into the price. If I didn't take it, then people would be overpaying for nothing."") really  don't give a SHISM about social implications, but rather they aim at the weaknesses of Corporate American families.

But let me say this about the DVDs - on 22 episodes, there are THREE (yes, my God, only THREE!) commentaries!  Hurwitz & Co. were in such a hurry to get this one out there (I can't blame them, dammit) that they neglected to retro-fit these PHENOMENAL episodes/characters with their own credible backstory!  What happened?!?!  Surely there is some history associated with Tobias's LATENT homosexuality (I imagine we'll learn about that later), but we learn nothing.

Overall, an absolutely BEST SHOW TO HAPPEN TO NETWORK TELEVISION.

2115700,5,B0002PYS7Y,"To be perfectly honest, I had never even heard of this show before a friend of mine suggested that I watch a few of the episodes.  I rented the first disc of the series and before the first episode had run to completion, I was on my way to buy the DVD set for myself.  The series is about a rich families' struggle to stay afloat after a series of incidents leads to the arrest of the head of the family company.  Michael Bluth, the son, does all that he can to keep the company going while at the same time dealing with his insanely dysfunctional family.  Every episode of this show is funny, but I would go so far as to say that some of them are uproarious.  The episode where his incompetent brother and his magician brother are construction workers has to be one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.  Arrested Development is somewhat sophisticated humor but is not completely devoid of humor that appeals to the other type of comedy fans.  Basically, this DVD set is good for anyone who enjoys a good laugh, I would suggest picking it up as quickly as possible, before everyone realizes what an excellent show it is.",1106265600,,1134,4.345971563981043
2115701,5,B0002PYS7Y,"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the great shows on TV right now.  It truly isn't like anything else you might see.  It has a jumpy, spontaneous, handheld look like many dramas you see these days, but it is far from serious.  This is a show that has characters that are very funny on their face, and when you dig deeper into their foibles, they become even funnier.  The characters are then thrown into outlandish situations at an unbelievable rate.  So much happens in one episode, it's almost dizzying.

This dizzying pace is kept understandable by the dry, impeccably timed narration of Ron Howard.  Because he helped create the show, he has understood from day one the importance of this narration.  To quickly fill in plot holes and most hilariously, to introduce things like flashbacks, flashforwards, archived photos, etc. etc.  His tone NEVER attempts to be funny.  He's not telling a joke, but he is certainly setting up one joke after another.  Normally, narration is a painful, lazy device that grates.  But this show handles it so deftly that it is integral to its success.  If the show were to eliminate the narration, it would absolutely NOT be the same show.

And cudos to all the great cast members:  Jason Bateman (in the performance of his career), playing straight-man Michael, is forced to run the company started by his father and run into the ground by his father in some Enron-like scandals.  They are home developers, and one scandal involves building homes in Iraq for Saddam.  All the other family members mostly want to mooch off the company and basically do everything they can to make Michael's life difficult.  And they also have their own ridiculous dreams and aspirations.  Michael has a twin sister who simply wants to be glamorous and lazy and shop all day...a dream held by her mother (Jessica Walters), except that the mother always snipes at her daughter about her weight...the daughter is played by the skeletally thin Portia delRossi.  Portia is married to Tobias, a former psychiatrist trying to be an actor.  Played by David Cross, he is my favorite character on the show.  Deluded, possibly gay but denying it, and best of all...a truly horrific actor!!!  Will Arnett plays older brother Gob (pronounced like Job, the biblical figure) a magician, with a huge chip on his shoulder.  There's younger brother Buster, who can't get out from under his mother's domineering shadow, and is the biggest mass of neurosis you'll ever see.  Michael's son, George Michael, is a likable but goofy teenager, embarrassingly attracted to his trouble-maker cousin Maebe.

Sounds confusing...and if you're new to the show, it probably all would be confusing for awhile.  This is that rare sitcom that needs you to watch week after week.  But thank God for the DVD release of the first season.  You can catch up with all the shenanigans and then start watching season 2.  Trust me, you'll laugh almost until it hurts with nearly every episode.  You've never seen a sitcom like it, because there isn't one quite like it.  The humor is bone, bone dry, with sprinklings of slapstick or the just plain absurd.  Full of marvelous guest roles for the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfuss, an amazingly game and funny Liza Minelli and Henry Winkler.  Even Blue Man Group (season 2, now that I think of it).  What's great about season 1 is that all the performers seem to have instinctively grasped the right tone for the show right off the bat.  With many great sitcoms, when you see their first few episodes, you see how they were still struggling to find their voice (MASH, SIMPSONS, SEINFELD).  The AD folks were off and running from the first moment, again aided by Howard's narration.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!

Word of warning for parents:  The DVD set contains a longer version of the pilot episode.  It's great fun to see that action-packed first show fleshed out...but apparently it must have been planned for HBO or something, because it has some pretty serious swearing in it.  In later episodes, some tirades of swearing are bleeped out to absolutely hilarious effect.  But keep your little ones away from the unexpurgated pilot.",1106092800,4,4156,4.852062588904694
2115702,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Now, I do not watch a huge amount of TV by anyone's idea, but when I saw Arrested Development I was struck by something original, creative, and strangely humorous.

As the intro says, the story is about a family that has been in business problems, and one son, Michael Bluth's (played by Jason Bateman) attempt to hold the family together.  That may seem like a simple premise, but behind that are hours worth of enjoyment.

As opposed to your traditional dysfunctional family, this one still struggles to remain a family; however, it also seems comfortably aloof.  Whether that entails a strange connection between Michael's son George Michael (played by Michael Cera) and his cousin Maeby (played by Alia Shawkat from the equally good 'State of Grace.'

Another example involves a mid-thirty aged son named Buster (played by Tony Hale) and his strange connection with his mother Lucille Bluth (played by Jessica Walter).  Either way it is the family's own imbalance that drive this show, along with some great acting to support the excellent and unique plot.

There has been some time since a show has been this funny and smart, probably early-Sorkin days.  Thus, Arrested Development holds its head high as one of the best shows today, and deservedly so.",1105920000,2,1257,4.9523809523809526

Jason Bateman has made an incredible comeback from obscurity to serve as the anchor of the show, just as he anchors the Bluth family.  The cast around him is uniformly excellent - Will Arnett and David Cross are my favorites, but it's hard to go wrong with choosing any of the supporting cast.  The writing is sharp throughout the season, with the show never losing its dry, ironic touch.

I didn't expect that Fox or any other network could come up with such a great show, one that matches some cable efforts.  I'd recommend this DVD collection both for current fans, and for those interested in catching on to something great.",1105920000,2,858,4.538961038961039

My friend got the Season One DVD for Christmas and I watched it all in two days, it was so entertaining.  First, the camera moves at kind of a fast pace with a laugh every second cuz the dialogue is so elaborately well written.  I am a big fan of David Cross but he's not even the funniest character on the show.  Jason Bateman turns out to be really good as the ""straight"" character.  Jeffrey Tambour is hilarious as the prison inmate father who converts to Judaism and starts his own video program.  The actor who plays Buster is probably the most awkward character with some of the funniest scenes.  The other brother, Gob, is good as the suave, lazy guy who dresses up as a cop sometimes.  And then there are the children, George Michael is great as the hard working and insecure youngster who's cousin (?) has many funny quips.

2115706,5,B0002PYS7Y,"I feel sorry for FOX TV because they have a problem with their show ""Arrested Development"". The problem is that this show plays better on DVD then it does on TV. Kudos to FOX for keeping it on the air a second season, but even a slot after The Simpons may not be enough to keep this show on the air for a third season. Luckily for us, the first season is on DVD with plenty of sweet extras to keep a smile on any ""Arrested"" fan's face.

The show chronicles the Bluth's, a California family spoiled by the money of their development corporation. In the pilot, the father is sent to jail and the company's assets are frozen. Our dysfunctional family is now forced to deal with the consequences of their greed, selfishness, and just plain weirdness. Jason Bateman plays Michael Bluth, the stable son, who tries to keep his family and business together.

Any other sitcom today might play this like a standard living room set where wackiness ensues, but ""Arrested Development"" plays it more like a documentary where wackiness ensues. Producer Ron Howard provides commentary-allowing scenes to flow into one another with more complexity. A great comic cast including, David Cross from ""Mr. Show"", Jeffrey Tambor from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and Portia de Rossi from ""Ally McBeal"" gel wonderfully together.

The real genius of the show is the writing however, comic plots included a character who has a crush on his cousin, an uncle who doesn't know he's gay, and a mother who tries to make her son jealous by adopting an Asian orphan. Which sadly proves that not even the FFC is watching this show on FOX, and here in lies the problem. There are so many hidden and underlining jokes that you get more out of this show watching the episodes back to back over the course of a month than you do trying to keep up with the show every Sunday, unless there's a special, rerun or sports game on.

On this DVD you also get cast commentary on a few on the episodes, deleted scenes, and a couple mini-documentaries including a question and answer session with the cast. If you like groundbreaking TV, or igneous comedy, buy this DVD and hope they release season 2 this summer. It may be your only chance to enjoy this show the way it was meant to be enjoyed.",1105574400,,2244,4.560794044665013
2115707,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Thanks to Arrested Development we all know what ""Never Nude"" is... And the world is a better place. Even forgetting never nude, the entire show is fan-dee-double-tastic.

The reason the show succeeds is because not only is it funny, but it's characters all connect with the viewer on some level. Maybe Gob is your best fried... maybe you've had illicit crushes like George Michael... perhaps your mother tried to keep everything under her greedy thumb. Whatever it is, we all know someone like everyone on the show. The cute-but-troublesome Maybe, the sensible and harrassed Michael... it goes on and on.

You can't really imagine anyone else playing the parts in the show, which is a great compliment. Trying to think of anyone else to play George Michael just seems wrong. Who else but David Cross could do Tobias? No one. It's just one of those rare times where it seems like the cast was perfect.

I love the way the the show is filmed. It feels kind of like a documentary without being overbaringly so. The cameras feel human, like you are actually in the room with them. They follow the action instead of predicting it.

2115711,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Critically acclaimed Emmy Winner Arrested Development is the most refreshing and entertaining show aired in years.  This docudrama styled sitcom from the minds of Ron Howard and Mitchell Hurwitz follows the bankrupt Bluth family after the patriarch (Jeffery Tambor) is arrested for defrauding investors.  Thus, the only sane member of the family Michael (Jason Bateman) desperately tries to save his family from financial ruin while combating his siblings and mother for control of the family company.  The season begins a bit rocky with a hilarious but somewhat discursive pilot that sets the stage for the series.  However, the show quickly takes off with one brilliantly funny episode after another.  The quick repartee writing of the show is magnificently showcased by an amazingly deft ensemble cast including Portia de Rossi, Will Arnett, and Jessica Walter.  The actors play off each-other seamlessly, effortlessly highlighting the hilarious scripts.  In our post-Enron world, the show has a grain of truth to it, but you can't help falling in love with the machinations of the Bluths.  This comedy isn't for everyone however.  This isn't the mindless predictability of Friends or the simplicity of Everyone Loves Raymond.  Arrested Development keeps company with Seinfeild, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and the better days of the Simpsons.  If you like quick, clever, biting humor, this shows for you.

2115714,5,B0002PYS7Y,"As reality TV continues rearing its ugly head on every major network, Arrested Development has arrived at just the right time for those of us itching for something intelligent to come over the airwaves.  With corporate malfeasance (rightly or wrongly) assuming so much of the public spotlight over the past several years, Arrested Development casts a light on the people behind such shady goings on, and in this case the picture is not pretty.  It's loosely classifiable as a sitcom, but Arrested Development is shot with more of a documentary/reality show style, giving it a distinctive look and feel that you just won't find in most of network TV's decidedly formulaic fare.  Not since The Simpsons was in its prime about a decade or so has a show so effortlessly balanced wit, randomness, and unapologetic vulgarity (as of this writing, rumors that The Simpsons is still on have yet to be substantiated).

At the center of everything is Jason Bateman as genial widower Michael Bluth, the one sane member of a wealthy but deeply dysfunctional family, charged with holding it together after his corrupt father's incarceration.  It's not easy, as Michael is surrounded by a collection of screwballs the likes of which you can scarcely imagine.  Fortunately, the characters on Arrested Development are far more than just zany caricatures; they're all brilliantly drawn and distinctive, aided by some masterful performances from the show's cast.  Yes, they're all isolated from reality and toxically self-absorbed, but the Bluth family still manages to come across as sympathetic.  Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi, who rarely fails to make my eyeballs bulge) is a pretentious ""liberal activist"" whose advocacy of fashionable causes is in sharp contrast to her vanity and terrible parenting.  Her husband Tobias (David Cross, whose fake mustache is a hysterical running joke in itself) is an utterly oblivious husband and father who's just left his psychiatry practice to pursue his pipe dream of becoming an actor.  Michael's older brother George Oscar (Gob) Bluth II (Will Arnett) is a smarmy, womanizing magician who never fails to take advantage of Michael's decency.  The youngest brother, perpetual student Buster (Tony Hale), is prone to outlandish panic attacks and hasn't managed to separate himself from his mother quite yet.

Speaking of the family matriarch, Jessica Walter turns in arguably the best performance of them all as Lucille Bluth, easily one of the most delightfully evil characters in TV history.  Domineering, manipulative, and occasionally downright cruel, Lucille is the most narcissistic member of a family full of narcissists.  She plays her children against each other, shows questionable loyalty to her husband, grubs money relentlessly, and constantly makes cutting remarks about Lindsay's weight in spite of her awe-inspiring gorgeousness. For his part, George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), in addition to his amoral business practices, isn't exactly the best father in the world.  In one especially hilarious series of flashbacks, we see his way of imparting everyday lessons to his children, which always involved some horrible simulated tragedy befalling a one-armed friend of his.  And while the relationship between Michael and his awkward son George-Michael does provide a bastion of tenderness amidst all the screwiness, it's also worth noting that George-Michael has a forbidden crush on his rebellious cousin Maeby.

But wait, there's more!  We're also treated to some hilarious and out-of-left-field special guest appearances, including Henry Winkler as the family's incompetent attorney Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as the ""blind"" prosecutor on the Bluths' case; Liza Minelli as Lucille's vertigo-plagued best friend/social rival who briefly becomes Buster's girlfriend in one of TV's all-time great mismatches; and Carl Weathers as, well, Carl Weathers.  I feel I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention ""Annyong,"" Lucille's adopted Korean son who gets his name from the Korean word for ""hello,"" which happens to be all he says for his first five episodes or so.

There isn't one episode on this season that's not up to par, not one.  All are brilliant in their own way, juggling plot strands in a Seinfeld-esque manner, but with non-linear plot structures more akin to the shamefully neglected classic Andy Richter Controls the Universe.  With numerous flashbacks and the deadpan narration of Ron Howard filling in any gaps, Arrested Development is able to truly go where network comedy has rarely gone before.  While many episodes do end with important life lessons, generally centering around the importance of family togetherness, the morals don't come until after various plot strands have come together in an all-hell-breaks-loose climax.  Some of the more outlandish climactic set pieces include a phony drug bust involving a bunch of male strippers in phony cop outfits; George Sr. attempting to escape from a Christmas pageant while dressed as a character in a painting; Michael and Gob wrestling ineptly over a woman while Buster desperately tries to get himself punched in the face; and Gob's failed attempts to trick the family's accountant into thinking he's killed a stripper.

Accompanying the twenty-two episodes of this first season are a bevy of extras, almost all of which are worth watching.  Most notably, we get an extended version of the pilot (complete with dirty words), commentaries that consist largely of the cast members ripping on each other and making off-color remarks, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and some loving tributes from TV Land.  On the whole, the special features provide a great deal of insight into how the show's unique look and feel were created, how the cast was selected and how they interact, how reams of material are cut down to one 20-minute-or-so episode, and scads of other random information.  Suffice to say that Mitchell Hurwitz, the show's creator, is clearly one very smart man.

With the Simpsons still in decline and Family Guy yet to return, I think I can safely go out on a limb and proclaim Arrested Development the best show on network TV right now.  By defying virtually every television convention known to man, Hurwitz & Co. have created something truly innovative and warped, which is no small task with cable channels relentlessly pushing the envelope.  Unfortunately, shows this original and challenging to the viewer don't typically last too long, but here's hoping this one proves to be an exception.  So far the second season has been almost as good as this one, so if there's any justice Arrested Development will succeed in catching on where previous excellent Fox series like Andy Richter Controls the Universe and Undeclared failed.",1104710400,35,6770,5.274674115456238
2115715,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Very rarely does a great TV show come along. I mean, sure, there's Hee-Haw, Matlock, and The Cosby Mysteries. But what idiot would say those are truly great?

Anyway: This is the first season of what will hopefully be a ""Full House""-like phenomenon among the American viewing public. But they're too fickle to appreciate this brilliant work of modern art. There should be ten stars available, because this is a ten-star review show.

You know the story: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the one sensible son from a family of lunatics and greedy Guses. This includes his father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), magician older brother Gob (Will ""Funniest Bastard Alive"" Arnett), his twin sis (Portia De Rossi), and his smothered younger brother Buster (Tony Hale). Throw into the mix his brother-in-law Tobias (the always excellent David Cross) and his son (Michael Cera) who has a crush on his own cousin Maeybe (Alia Shawkat), and you've got ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on speed.

The first season captures George Senior's imprisonment on unclear charges (you have to watch the season to know...no peeking) and Michael's attempts to save the family business...mostly from his family. There's way too much going on in each episode to even attempt a summary here.

The casting is stellar: Jason Bateman has risen from career death to emerge as a star again, while relative unknowns like Arnett and Hale will not be forgotten anytime soon. De Rossi and Cross are wonderfully off-kilter as the troubled couple, and the matriarch (whose name I forget right now) is brilliantly cold and yet concerned at the same time.

If you love smart, innovative comedies that take risks, this is the show for you. I knew I was a fan when I first saw the episode in which Gob tries in vain to make a dramatic gesture of throwing a letter into the ocean. And I've enjoyed the ride since.

A lot of critically acclaimed sitcoms are usually crap, but this is the exception. ""Arrested Development"" may just be the best sitcom of the last ten years, so this first season will be required viewing at any ""television-writing"" course of the future if there's any justice in this world. Trust me, no matter how messed-up your family is, the Bluths put the fun in dysfunctional...",1104537600,2,2242,4.856020942408377

While A.D. is the most inspired, original comedy on BROADCAST TV currently, the actor's are too self-aware to not ""be funny"" and it shows when viewing.  the Emmy was well deserved, but had ""The Office"" been eligible in the same category, it would have been just like the Golden Globes- an ""Office"" sweep.",1104278400,5,547,4.978021978021978

One of the joys of the DVD collection is that it includes oodles of outtakes - a must for a show with some of the best improvers in the business.  Also, nice commentary on a couple of episodes by the whole cast.

2115718,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Who could have foreseen that, even in the 21st Century, a sitcom would seem edgy and radical if it dares to go on the air without a laugh track?  Into this land of the formulaic comes a show which not only spurns the laugh track convention, but opens up the form to new narrative possibilities, weaves complex layers of satirical meaning, creates a whole stable of unforgettable characters... in short, reinvents a form that has been in desperate need of reinventing.

Arrested Development is even better on DVD; the interviews and extended pilot give a greater insight into the show's ambitious intent, it stands up wonderfully to repeated viewings-- plus-- who knew?  Turns out a great TV show is even better without the commercials!

At this point I have seen every episode on these DVDs at least once and perhaps six or seven times, and I could go into great detail about why I believe this is the most inventive and important sitcom since ""All In The Family"".  I will say this: with repeated showings, the Bluthe family becomes increasingly complex and sympathetic. Character and pathos provide the viewer with fresh insights and surprises, long after you already know all the jokes. Every Bluthe, however vain, self-absorbed or deluded, is allowed to a moment of thoughtfulness and nobility without violating the intergrity of the character.  And damn it, this is certainly a disfunctional family, but it is a family-- and you really start to get a feel for the ties that bind them.  Sometimes, the Bluths are unkind with each other, but they forgive each other-- and I think that forgiveness is as important to being in a family as all the togetherness you see in the Mormons public service ads.",1104105600,3,1702,4.828178694158075
2115719,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This show is perhaps the best-written and best-acted comedy to ever be on TV. Of course everyone grants that title to Seinfeld. But while the 4 main characters of that show turned into caricatures of themselves after the first 3 seasons, Arrested Development keeps each character fresh and funny, week in and week out. Granted it's only been around for 19 episodes or so. But compare it to a show like Curb Your Enthusiasm (which I also love). CYE benefits from being on HBO and being able to be as explicit as it wants to be while AD has to be brutally subtle, making it that much funnier.

I had seen the first season on TV (Thank God for TiVo) and bought this the day it came out. My brothers saw a couple episodes and then haven't given it back. You will be as addicted as the rest of us are once you see this great first season. And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE start watching and telling your friends about it. They will thank you and it will ensure that this amazing show stays on the air.

2115720,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Arrested Development brings to TV what most satirical shows lack: smart, biting, cutting-edge SATIRE!  The show is hiliariously irreverent (sometimes ""spicy""), well-written, with casting that is simply genius.  Ron Howard acts as the executive producer, and does the narration for the show.

Jason Bateman stars as the only member who approaches ""normal"" of a grandly dysfunctional family.  Jeffery Tambor plays the patriarch who has built up a sizeable fortune building homes and developing real estate.  However, all is not well within the empire, and as the legal troubles mount, the eccentric personalities simply add to the mess that is becoming their lives.  The rest of the cast is stellar, without a weak link: Buster, the infantile younger brother, Gob (pronounced ""Jobe""), the older brother who dreams of being a magician and has a very high opinion of himself, Lindsay, the shallow daughter who vacillates between financial hedonism and questionable causes, Tobias, the bro-in-law whose sexuality is vague, Lucille, the mother of the clan who is all about furs and martini lunches. Too much to detail here, but not for the easily offended. Some language, adult situations, etc.  If you aren't offended by the charity HOOP (Hands Off Our Penises - an anti-circumcision cause), then you'll be ok with this show.

The show is currently on FOX, Monday nights at 8:00ET - by all means, watch it!  If you've missed earlier episodes, you'll want this collection from Season 1.

Bluth children being taught a lesson by their father (Jeffery Tambor).

I can't call this a sitcom because it doesn't fit in the typical formulaic mode of slapstick comedy, quick quips and silly situations.

The use of no-laugh track is wonderful.  This is an affect that has been used before to varying degrees of success.  For Arrested Development, it is a homerun.  You end up focusing on the dialogue and the sitatuations and are not force fed on when to laugh.

Jason Bateman is a revelation.  He brings normalcy to the family and is very likeable.  He has his faults, but you tend to laugh with him (though he may be slighly laughing, you can feel his utter confusion of how his family continues to act like they do) as his family is in continal meltdown.  His relationship with his sister (Portia) and with Gob are also hillarious to watch.

Gob (pronounced Job...as in Job in the bible) is a fabulous character.  Seeing him on his segway machine (in the middle of traffic often, going down steep hills, through neighborhoods, on construction sites) is always good for a laugh.  His magic tricks...he is one truly great character.

The guest appearances throughout the first season are so absurd that it is funny.  Carl Weathers as the actor that Funke should try to follow, Liza Minelli is terrific in her role as Buster's girlfriend and Henry Winkler is a very funny quack lawyer.

I loved the episode with 'Hermano' as Michael and Gob tried to figure out who their girlfriend was having an affair with...the episode when Michael's son is trying to buy weed for Buster is hillarious...'they are policemen and they are hot!'

2115749,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This show caught me by surprise, partly because it was so good, partially because it is so acclaimed, but mostly because it is both good and acclaimed.  Absolutely addicting, I watched the entire series in a few days.

The strength of the show lies in the best writing I have seen in ages.  More to the point, the strength of the writing is its perfect character and relationship development.  Despite a large cast, the relationship of any two characters is profound.  They constantly interact, in doing so, we learn more about each character.  No one is left stranded.  The family always seems like a family, albeit everything wrong that a family can be.  The development of the ties between the characters creates an odd empathy and a familiarity with otherwise insane and over the top people.

Summery, I have never seen a show (comedy or drama) that so effectively built relationships for each character.  This is difficult writing and it is done perfectly.  I recommend just buying the DVD and starting with the beginning so that you understand where everyone is coming from in future episodes.",1099267200,4,1099,4.854838709677419
2115750,4,B0002PYS7Y,"The DVD is great because this is such a smart show, each time I watch an episode I get more of the jokes.

I went out and bought the DVD the day it came out so I could watch it on the plane the next day. I was laughing so hard on the plane my sides started to hurt.

The extras were disappointing. There are no bloopers, even though there must have been some hilarious ones. And supposedly Michael Cera and David Cross are brilliant at improvising lines but none of those moments were heard either. The interview with the cast was severely edited so you know you missed a lot of good moments there, too.

I think the show deserves 5 stars but the extras on the DVD were disappointing so I had to give it a 4.

Caution to those who have never seen the show but are thinking about buying the DVD: I love it, and would recommend it to anyone, but my husband, who loves the Simpsons, King of the Hill, and other offbeat shows about dysfunctional families really doesn't like this show at all. He says he's irritated that Jason Bateman's character stays with the family and puts up with all their dysfunctional behavior. So caveat emptor.",1098921600,14,1133,4.330188679245283
2115751,5,B0002PYS7Y,"There are more laughs, and more big laughs, in 22 minutes of Arrested Development than in 22 episodes of whatever redundant sitcom garbage ABC pumps out on Tuesday night.  Witty and slapstick silly and non sequitur weirdness all at the same time, this show boasts one of the best casts in television, and the best collection of offbeat characters not in animation.  It bears a resemblance in structure and approach to the Royal Tenenbaums (but this show has even more laughs, and is more rewatchable), so if you liked the Royal Tenenbaums or Family Guy or the peak years of the Simpsons, you'll love this show.  You know a show is great when the so called straight character  (Michael, played by Jason Bateman), has some of the best lines in the show.  Bateman is perfect with the character, he is able to balance understated sarcasm and likable human decency in a way that few actors can achieve, particularly in an oddball comedy such as this.

The sleazy magician Gob, played by Will Arnett, is consistently hilarious and an ingenious comic creation.  David Cross and Jeffrey Tambor, two great comic actors from cult HBO TV shows (""Mr. Show"" and the ""Larry Sanders Show""), are also fantastic as the sexually dubious Tobias and the oblivious Patriarch of the family.  Every member of the cast has his or her moments, and each character adds something to the Seinfeld-esque interwoven plots.  The only weakness in the show, is the whole cousin crush subplot that lingered a little bit too long, and it was--intentionally--kinda creepy.

Nonetheless this is one of the few items I'd recommend to someone who hasn't even seen a single episode, to just jump in and buy the DVD.  The second episode, ""There's always money in the banana stand!"", is one of the funniest episodes of any TV show I have ever seen.",1098921600,4,1806,4.77491961414791

I can't even compare it to anything for you-almost like Family Guy randomness with Curb Your Enthusiasm's sarcasm and everyday life scenarios.  It has this appeal that kids and adults could understand....while Gob is my favorite character, the very real and deliciously evil grandmother is my parents.

2115755,5,B0002PYS7Y,"TV fans owe a debt of gratitude to HBO, who single-handedly raised the bar for intelligent television.  Though it took a few sweeps of the Emmys for network execs to take notice, Fox finally answered the call last year with Arrested Development, a comedy so offbeat and so unlike anything else, that it may be a victim of its own success.

A critical darling, but a show trying desperately to find its footing among the TV public, Arrested Development spent much of its brilliant first season teetering on the brink of extinction.  Fox must be commended for having the foresight to keep this gem alive.  Hopefully, with this DVD release, this can't-miss show will gain the foothold it needs.

The Bluth family had it all, or so they thought.  But, when their patriarch is arrested for cooking the books of his family's land development company, all of their assets are frozen, and the once wealthy and entitled Bluths find themselves struggling to get by.

At the center of this debacle is Michael, the good son who wants nothing more than to keep his family together.  This wouldn't be so hard if it weren't for his family's outrageous and numerous dysfunctions.  Michael is surrounded by an incredibly quirky cast of characters, including his sleazy older brother GOB, an out-of-work magician who was blackballed for revealing his secrets; Lindsay, his conniving younger sister, who tries to turn charity into profit; and Buster, the family's youngest and most inept, who still lives with his mother, and accidentally is dating his mother's best friend.  They're joined by Tobias, Lindsay's sexually ambiguous husband, who lost his medical license for performing CPR on a sleeping man, and who now is pursuing his dreams of becoming an actor.  There's also George Michael, Michael's wonky son who harbors an unnatural crush on his cousin Maeby.  Pulling the strings are the Bluth parents.  The father continues to conduct under-the-table dealings from prison, and the manipulative mother dedicates her time to pitting her children against one another, even going so far as to adopt a Korean child to make Buster jealous.

Of course, it is truly impossible to describe Arrested Development.  The show, though absolutely absurd, truly believes in the world that it has created, and the writing plays brilliantly off of the character's traits.  Filmed with a single camera, Arrested Development has the look of a documentary, which further grounds the ""reality"" of the show.  The wise omission of a laugh track allows the writers and actors to pack more gags per minute than any show before it.  Indeed, some people may find it hard to find a show funny when no one has told them to laugh, but the true pleasure of the show is that you can discover the humor yourself.

Arrested Development is perfect for DVD.  Even if you've seen every episode, the show is even more rewarding on a second viewing.  There are so many subtle gags and references that you simply can't get them all the first time.  It's also a great tool to convert your friends to show, as all it will take is the 40 minutes to watch ""Visiting Ours"" and ""Pier Pressure"" to get someone hooked.

The DVDs present a very sharp picture on par with the HD broadcasts.  The sound is just Dolby ProLogic, but it gets the job done.  The extras are varied.  I wished there had been more behind-the-scenes stuff, but what's there is interesting.  The deleted scenes are hit-or-miss.

All in all Arrested Development is a must-own for any fan of truly intelligent comedy.  This show joins the ranks of the elite, along with The Larry Sanders Show, Mr. Show, and NewsRadio.",1098662400,4,3627,4.852032520325203

Do you yawn when listening to the bland, contrived jokes of recent sitcoms?  Watch Arrested Development!!  It is pure genious.  Spontaneous and funny remarks from every character will catch you off-guard and make you collapse in laughter.

The first episode you'll think it's weird.  The second episode you'll think it's quirky.  By the third episode you will think it is the funniest thing ever!  Just make sure to watch at least three episodes before you make any conclusions.

2115759,5,B0002PYS7Y,"TV has gone through a lot of different comedy shows and styles, and it was about time something like Arrested Development showed up.  It's a shame that so few people watched the first season...They missed out.

Once you watch one episode, it becomes apparent why Arrested Development was the winner of the Emmy for Best Comedy.  Every element of the show works together to create laugh-out-loudable comedy.  The writers behind the show are immensely clever and set up each joke wonderfully.

Another overlooked asset to the show is the breakthrough camera-work.  Instead of the still/panning cameras like those in most sitcoms, it has the slight feeling like it's being filmed by an amateur cameraperson, because of the zooming in and out and the occasional jittering.  But believe me, this is not a bad thing, and is used often in a very comedic way, such as zooming into a face at just the right time, often at awkward, silent moments.  Often the awkward, silent moments are the funniest in the show.

Credit should also go to the actors and actresses in the show.  They play their parts extremely well and were cast perfectly, in my opinion.  The show is very clever in bringing out each character's eccentricities and developing mirthful scenarios around them.

If you have not watched Arrested Development, be sure to watch it with an open mind, because it is not like most comedy programs on television.  But once I kept watching, I was thoroughly addicted, and can't wait to see what next season holds.

The show's plots are never meant to be dramatic, but still, there can be a few moving moments; although they are usually broken open by a following joke.  In general, this show quite well avoids the usual trite situations and storylines that most shows continue to repeat.  I found myself caught off-guard many a time by little surprises in the storylines that had me hurling myself off the couch and into a fetal position on the floor, rolling with laughter.

I give this one of my highest recommendations.",1098316800,6,2018,4.819767441860465
2115760,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Let me put it this way - I happened to catch the last 4 episodes of Arrested Development when FX ran a marathon this past Saturday...By Tuesday morning (the day the DVD came out), I was at Blockbuster absolutely desperate to see how it all began.  I was not disappointed in the least.

This show is unbelievably hilarious and scathing at the same time.  In one episode, the matriarch of this once wealthy family goes to an after-party for a Spanish awards show and proceeds to ask every man there to fetch her a drink (you know, since every Latin man in a tux is a waiter and all).  The humour in this show works because while it is clearly mocking the idle rich, the writing is intelligent and the delivery is dry and razor-sharp.  I gave the DVD 5 stars because it also comes with more special features than most TV shows.  Each of the 3 discs comes with a commentary, extended or deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage of the show.

This is one of the most complete shows I've watched recently - well written, well cast, and well acted.  The characters and storylines are developed throughout the arc of the season, but you won't be lost if you happen to start by watching the latter episodes as I did.  Other reviewers have compared this show to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, and The Office - and rightfully so.  I just wanted to add another show to that list - Sports Night.  Sports Night was another great, well written show that was critically acclaimed.  However, it was cancelled after two seasons.

2115763,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Saying that this is the best comedy series currently on American television is obvious in the extreme.  There have been embarrassingly few comedies that have respected the viewers' intelligence as much as this perceptive series.  It is not surprising to see the amount of critical praise that has been heaped upon this work.  The erudite writers do not create quirky characters simply for the sake of making them interesting.  Each has his or her complete back-story that fits into the entire dysfunctional family system.

This is rare comedy that can be enjoyed on a superficial level but what also bears scrutiny on deeper and intellectual levels.  In other words, after you are finished laughing, you can think about it and laugh some more.

It never condescends to the viewer; it seems that the writers truly couldn't care if anyone ""gets"" a particular joke.  Let me site my favourite comedic thread: Canadian actor Will Arnett's character, Gob (for George Oscar Bluth) believes that his girlfriend is having an affair with ""Hermano.""  For those *completely* ignorant of the Spanish language, this means, ""brother.""  The writers never explained this in the episode, however, until the following episode.  When his responsible brother Michael (played by newly-acclaimed actor Jason Bateman; yes, brother to Justine) asked him why he didn't know the word after some four years of studying the Spanish language in school, he replied that they didn't teach words like that in class.

Enjoy what tends to be a contradiction in television: a hilarious intelligent comedy.  And thanks to the producers for not having a laugh track to tell us what is funny.",1097971200,,1653,5.100371747211896

The Bluth family is a very wealthy and utterly spoiled American family. When real estate tycoon George Bluth Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested for numerous counts of corporate fraud, the rest of the family are forced to give up their lavish lifestyles. Now, good son Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) must free his manipulative father, save the family business and keep order among his incompetent relatives. Produced by acclaimed filmmaker Ron Howard, ""Arrested Development"" is the funniest well written comedy of the year. The episodes are wickedly clever and the humor is refreshing and sharp. The comic cast is simply outstanding. In its debut season, this original comedy received unanimous good reviews from critics and won numerous awards for its creative writing and solid comic performances. The first season of ""Arrested Development"" includes guest appearances by Julia Louis Dreyfus, Henry Winkler, Carl Weathers, Heather Graham and Liza Minnelli. The season also includes such memorable episodes like ""Pier Pressure"", ""Not Without My Daughter"" and ""Let'Em Eat Cake"".

Fans won't be disappointed with ""Arrested Development: Season One"". All 22 episodes and the extended pilot are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 3-Disc set has a bright and detailed video transfer and a clean Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Among special features, it includes three great audio commentaries by series creators and cast members, deleted and extended scenes, a ""Q&A"" panel discussion with the cast, ""Breaking Ground"" and ""The Making of a Future Classic"" behind-the-scenes documentaries, 28 original songs and a short sneak peak of season two hosted by series producer Ron Howard.

2115769,5,B0002PYS7Y,"What can I say that the other reviewers haven't said? This is one of those shows that stands out from the rest. Not only would I watch it religiously on Sunday nights but I would videotape it and re-watch the episodes on tape 3-4 times and it seemed like everytime I watched it again, I would catch onto something new that I didn't see before.

Arrested Development is a well thought out comedy with many quirky characters, and plotlines. I can proudly say that this is my favourite show because I can watch every episode over and over again without getting tired of it. I've already pre-ordered my dvd set and I can't wait to get it.

Just because some people don't get the humour, doesn't make it a bad show. It just shows their lack of attentiveness. This show does keep you on the edge of your seats and when you rewatch it, you'll notice things that you didn't catch before. Like in the episode where Michael said that the workers had to be watched because they're like sheep that needed to be herded. Then later on in the episode, you see the workers getting lost and they're being herded into the back of a truck by two dogs.

George Sr: ""Where the hell is everybody?""
Gob: ""I'm here dad""
George Sr: ""I can't believe no one showed up!""
Lucille to George Michael: ""She's not real. She was made in a cup..like soup.""

Michael: ""I forgot about my dad's hearing..""

2115771,5,B0002PYS7Y,"The format of television we know as a sitcom is dying. The end of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" in May will be the death of the 'filmed before a live studio audience' sitcom. One camera shows like AD are the ones to watch now, and thank god it, and others like it, are here. They are a dying breed. This is the best half hour comedy to hit the top major networks in years and the most critically acclaimed one at that. So naturally, it was a flop in ratings and struggled to stay alive. Typical. The ""Pilot"" episode pretty much sums it up for the show. George Bluth(Jeffrey Tambor), is arrested for insider trading, and the Bluth family realize they need son Michael(Jason Bateman), to help with the family company after his father passed him over for the job. He tries to hold the company in check and to keep his continuously dysfunctional family together. His family includes his cold, icy mother Lucille(Jessica Walter), his spoiled, shallow sister Lindsey(Portia De Rossi), doctor turned struggling actor brother in law Tobias(David Cross), niece Maybe, struggling magician brother Gob(Will Arnett), mama's boy little brother Buster(Tony Hale), and his own son, the hysterically named George Michael(Michael Cera), who has an unhealthy crush on Maybe. The show is also narrated by it's producer, non other than Ron Howard. Every episode is packed with the most brilliant and intelligent writing, and sly references that you will only get if you are truly on your game. It's funny as heck, and impeccably performed, written, and directed. It is a mature and sophiticated humor. The kind that will go over a lot of people's heads if you don't understand it. And a lot don't. Julia Louis Dreyfuss appears as a blind attorney in the classic ""Alter Egos"", and the second part, ""Justice Is Blind"". Henry Winkler has a recurring role as the family attorney. The best stunt casting here is Liza Minnelli, as a socialite with vertigo and a competition between Lucille, and a relationship with Buster. Incredible. Somehow, Carl Weathers figures into it as well. Other incredible moments here include the episode ""Pier Presure"", where Buster tries to score some pot for Liza's handicap. ""In God We Trust"" is another winner where we learn of Tobias' naked hang up. There are way too many good things here to mention. Every episode pretty much hits it out of the park and there are so many things, big or little, in every single episode. It's the most well conceived shows on the air. Who knew Jason Bateman was a comedy god?. The guy's deadpan delivery is so good, you wonder where his emmy is. The rest are just as excellent. Jessica Walter has the perfect demeanor for her role as Lucille, and Arnett and Hale are as perfect as can be. Michael Cera is a tremendous young actor. He really makes George Michael seem like a real kid. Not an actor trying to be what writers think a kid would say and do just to be funny or interesting. And hey, it's always a plus when Jeffrey Tambor is around. This is pitch perfect writing and direction. With it's renewal for a second season, and it's recent emmy win for Best Comedy, Best Writing, and Best Direction, it gives hope that the TV Gods just may be wising up after all.

Excluding the Simpsons, this is the funniest thing that has come out of FOX in the last 20 years (yes, the Swan is funny, but not funny enough).  The acting is impecable.  Bravo.  Bravo.",1096070400,3,218,4.35
2115773,5,B0002PYS7Y,"This is my first review for Amazon, but I love this show with all my heart and soul and I had to throw in my two cents.  If you could give a rating of 500 stars, I would have done so without hesitation.  Can I just rate it stars to infinity?

In just one season Arrested Development has established itself as a classic comedy.  With imaginative, multi-layered scripts and some of the strangest characters that you've ever seen this is the perfect show to own on DVD because the more you watch an episode the more you see in it.

Every character is flawed in some way (yes, even Michael), but the actors are able to make them likable and you find yourself pulling for them.  My favorites are perpetual graduate student and mama's boy, Buster and selfish, socialite mother Lucille.  Played respectively by Tony Hale and Jessica Walters, they always stand out.  That being said, though, every one of the actors and characters is wonderful.  Even peripheral characters like the terrible attorney Barry Zuckercorn and conniving secretary Kitty are memorable.

As the creator of the show said as he accepted the well deserved Emmy award for Best Comedy, ""Just watch it.""",1095811200,12,1164,4.717821782178218
2115774,5,B0002PYS7Y,"Simply put: The best new sitcom to hit the small screen since Curb Your Enthusiasm.  This is clearly the best that network television has to offer, a refreshing change from the cookie-cutter ""dysfunctional family"" or ""oversexed pals"" sitcoms that have been shoved down our throats for the last decade.

AD features what is, far and away, the most original and imaginiative group of characters in TV history.  While credit goes to the creators for that, it is the actors that truly make these characters work.  The show is perfectly casted, with Will Arnett (GOB) and David Cross (Tobias) particularly shining.  Jason Bateman has revived his career as Michael, best described as the least crazy one.

The poster who compared AD to Malcom in the Middle is off his/her rocker, and those who compare this show to Scrubs do it a great disservice.  Scrubs, which I love, doesn't have the same creativity behind its plots; it's also much more jokey.  AD is much more subtle and creative - and, in the ultimate compliment to a sitcom - even has shades of Seinfeld, where several plot lines will tie in at the end.  Still, the show maintains its own identity, mixing original characters, witty dialogue and sometimes outrageous stories to perfection.

Through only one season, AD has quickly become one of my three favorite shows ever.  The DVD is a no-brainer, day-of-release purchase that may even force me to use a vacation day...",1095811200,62,1424,4.867219917012448

""Arrested Development"" is an original -- bright, funny, strange, smart, and (gasp) not intended for the lowest common denominator! The show has characters who are engaging and appealing, even though they're also crazy, plots that loop around and pay off up every tiny set-up, a fabulous cast that just cannot be improved on, and now a whole pile of much-deserved Emmy awards as well. If you like ""The Simpsons,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"" and other eccentric and brilliant shows, you will fall in love with ""Arrested Development.""",1095724800,8,697,5.017241379310345

They all think that since it is a new show it isn't good enough yet to be smart and funny. Lots of shows weren't very funny in their first season and they expect the same for this show. No no no no no no no no no. This had one of the funniest first seasons of all time if not THE BEST. It is one of the only sitcoms I can think of that won the Emmy for Best Comedy Series in it's first season. Also, Jason Bateman is going to go down as one of the only child stars to live down his past. He is hilarious on this and is just as funny in his small role in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Anyways, give this show a chance. It deserves it. This show is anything but over rated, it is really, with all the great reviews and Emmys, Under Rated. This is the best show since Seinfeld.

2115780,5,B0002PYS7Y,"The world of half-hour televised comedy needed a good shot in the arm.  It came in the form of the Bluth family.  If you have grown weary of the idiosyncratic behaviour of the run of the mill sitcom families as seen on Raymond, King of Queens, Yes Dear, 8 Simple Rules, My Wife and Kids and so on then Arrested Development will feel like a fresh pallete of family disfunction.
I am a fan of the single-camera comedy productions but Arrested leans more to the witty and circumstantial comedy that was seen on the innnovator of single-camera comedy, The Larry Sanders Show.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is getting a good run for its money as the events unfolding for the Bluth Family saga provide some of the most original and comedic writing this year -- on any show.
The key...characterization.  There is no single character that demands the spotlight as they all possess foibles that avail them ample recognition.  GOB, the entertainer; always aware that the camera is on him and so he feels obligated to become his own dramatic sequence, culling inspiration from dated and hackneyed dramatic devices.  He may easily be the funniest of the ""normal"" characters on the show.  Then there's Buster; sheer commitment to timidity is all I can say about this actor.  Buster's panic attacks and faux bravados serve as great physical comedy to GOB's verbal comedy.  George Sr., the source of the disfunction is well-played by Emmy-nominated Geoffrey Tambor as his vices and complacency know no bounds.  And Michael, the straight-man to everyone else is underrated as it is through his eyes do we see the absurdity that is the Bluth family.
Now the stories, great episodes include Pilot, Bringing Up Buster, Let 'Em Eat Cake, and well the other 19 episodes that I won't mention here because this series is just that a series.  It does not rely on stand-alone episodes and one-off humour.  This is an intelligent show for the educated viewer and this DVD is definitely worth a purchase as we may be looking at the heir the Gary Schandling throne.",1095206400,,2029,4.782234957020058

2115782,5,B0002PYS7Y,"There isn't a series on television (comedy or drama) that surpasses the consistent level of quality achieved by ""Arrested Development.""  A casual viewer can enjoy an episode as a standalone presentation, but loyal (and attentive) fans are rewarded with astoundingly funny story arcs and inside jokes.

For the price, even a simple compilation of the first 22 episodes (without any bonus material) would be a bargain.  Instead, we're being treated to a top-notch assortment (16:9 aspect ratio, deleted/extended segments, interviews, commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage and even the ability to listen to 29 original songs by David Schwartz).

For established fans, this is a dream collection.  For the uninitiated, this is a golden opportunity to see what you've been missing.  Either way, the decision to purchase this DVD set should be a no-brainer.",1093910400,35,853,5.473282442748092

Too bad for all those millions of people who aren't even aware of this show. They are missing out on a brilliant show. Possibly too smart and above the level of comprehension of those viewers who are used to a laugh track telling them when something is funny, Arrested may lose a few potential viewers. Another thing about the show is that each episode gets better every single time you view it. You start to notice things and then you cannot get the antics of the Bluth family out of your head.

With the loss of unique programming such as Buffy, Angel, Futurama, X-Files, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, and Firefly this show is the future of television.

Anyone who does not at least appreciate the show is simply showing their ignorance to what this show is trying to do and how it is breaking the mold. Arrested Development is extremely intelligent and goes over the heads of many. When one says, ""It's about as funny as an episode of law and order"", he is indicating that he has an intelligence equal to a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie, or more accurately, Love Story.

It's like one big private joke. The jokes build and build over the episodes, circling back and adding to them and changing them in even more hilarious ways.
