2728292,4,B0000DZ3BL,"Though he's now fairly widely known through his appearances on the New Hollywood Squares, Bruce Vilanche's work has been heard (and laughed at) by millions of people worldwide.  As a joke writer for artists (Bette, Whoopi, Billy, Robin), events (Academy Awards), and in his earlier days, TV (Brady Bunch Variety Show, Donny & Marie), Vilanche is one of a few select go-to guys in Hollywood.
The documentary mixes interviews with his clients, footage of his featured work, snippets of Vilanche himself speaking at awards ceremoies (he won an Emmy for his Oscar work) and rare performances, and, most interestingly, some work sessions. The last is the most interesting, as it provides some insight as to how Vilanche goes about creating his jokes.  His description of writing for different individuals - creating jokes and then voicing them appropriately, is fascinating.  The peek into the working process of different comedians (Midler, Crystal, Williams) is revealing both of Vilanche and his clients.
What really makes this film work is that  Vilanche is as interesting as the stars he writes for - something that cannot be said of all comedy writers.",979516800,13,1153,5.149732620320855

8167966,5,B0000DZ3BL,"If you've ever watched a major awards show (Oscars, Emmys, etc.) and roared (or gasped) with laughter at the jokes, you were most likely enjoying Bruce's work. Of all the writers on these shows (plus various TV musical-variety specials), he is the best and (deservedly) best known. His writing is hysterically funny and often delightfully raunchy. This documentary on him is terrific.",1327708800,,384,5.209677419354839

8167968,5,B0000DZ3BL,"I knew of Vilanch as a comedy writer, but I had no idea  all this guy was into and how much respect he has in the industry.  Parts of this DVD are laugh out loud hilarious and frankly Robin Williams has NEVER been funnier and that really is saying something, his bit is totally extemporaneous and it is classic Robin Williams, it alone is worth the price of this DVD, but it really is Vilanch that shines here, he is so likeable and you can tell he loves what he does and frankly you really can't blame him.",1142899200,5,507,4.163265306122449
8167969,4,B0000DZ3BL,"Millions of people know of Bruce Villanche from his appearances on the ""Hollywood Squares""  with his bushy hair, glasses, and T-shirt collection.  America has been laughing at his work for many years, though.  He's written everything from TV shows (the Academy Awards and ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hou,r"" just to name a few) to the speeches and jokes for today's hottest stars, including Bette Midler, Whoppi Goldberg and Billy Crystal.  This documentary takes you into his world, showing you his creative process in snippets of his own stand-up, interviews with some of his clients, and scenes from TV shows and ceremonies.
The DVD has no extras, but it's still a great film showcasing one of the funniest men in America.",1074643200,5,721,4.983333333333333
