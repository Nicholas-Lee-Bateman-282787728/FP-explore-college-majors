This DVD is an amazing view of some of the most beautiful landscape and buildings in the world.  Even more amazing after seeing these places for myself, then watching the DVD in HD !!!
Gives me all the more incentive to return to these wonderful countries.",1321401600,,390,6.627450980392157
8361427,5,B002BI4JKQ,"I found these videos over the summer a couple of years ago and my wife started laughing at me when I told her about them.  For me, they're very addictive.  The only thing I wish they would do is a complementary series that spent time at each of the locations they show such as the famous castles and houses.  Other than that you can't complain.",1304380800,,344,4.2615384615384615
8361428,5,B002BI4JKQ,"I originally saw the segment entitled ""The Heart of Italy"" on the Smithsonian Channel HD and was absolutely engrossed with the incredible aerial imagery and superb narration and couldn't stop watching it.  After the program finished I immediately jumped on the internet to purchase a couple copies:  one for myself and another for a family member.  This production is extremely well done and makes you want to hop on the next flight to Europe.  There are breathtaking shots of European landscapes from the air, not to mention various famous landmarks, buildings, plazas, etc.  I've traveled through Europe before, but this video opens up a whole new perspective on the region.  The information provided through voice-over narration is just as top-notch as the imagery.  The only complaint I could possible voice about this DVD is that I haven't been able to find a version in Blu-ray after an extensive online search.  This is a shame because the video is all shot in high definition and looks incredible on DVD, but I'm sure it would be that much more awe inspiring in 1080p HD.  At the time I'm writing this, Amazon.com is selling the DVD for around $13 whereas the Smithsonian Channel online is selling it for roughly $2 dollars cheaper.  However, based on my previous positive experiences with Amazon.com and their solid customer service, and more importantly their reliability, the peace of mind is certainly worth more than a couple bucks.  And at $13 this video is a steal for what you get!",1281052800,3,1497,4.900793650793651
8361429,4,B002BI4JKQ,"This is a great tour of the UK, Ireland, France, and Italy viewed from a helicopter. Most of each country's familiar landmarks are included as well as the unfamiliar. My minor complaint is that it left me longing to land and walk around to see everything up close and personal. The photography is in HD, making everything crystal clear.",1271894400,7,336,4.711864406779661
