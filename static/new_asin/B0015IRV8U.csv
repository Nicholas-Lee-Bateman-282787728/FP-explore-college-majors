8258701,3,B0015IRV8U,"Offered for free with the June 2007 issue of the UK magazine Metal Hammer this DVD seemed to play fine on my DVD player even though I'm in a different zone so I am assuming (a dangerous thing to do I know) that there is no region coding on this product.

Anyway, the product description will tell you the track list. The emphasis is however on live clips with this release and so the clips are often from live DVD's of the bands in question rather than promo clips and that may actually make this more of a useful product for some collectors. On top of that is some sort of segment from some form of battle of the bands style competition which looks pretty lame to tell the truth so unless you are a real zealot of one of the bands involved (Turisas, Deathstars, Breed 77 and The Zico Chain) then you probably won't get much use out of this section of the DVD.

Also filling up space are a range of snippets involving a range of bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, Dragonforce, Dio, Stone Sour/Slipknot and others. As a general rule of thumb, the younger the band the more groan inducing their interview footage and escapades (I think it's all about connecting with the kids). So you'll watch it all once, wince, and then start cherry picking your favourite live clips.
