8096596,2,B000CBEX0A,"I am about halfway through the episode with the bike race.  I love vintage style tv, especially (but not limited to) cop shows! but was surprised to find this one was about putting me to sleep (zzz)!  I paused it and read the two reviews already posted:  ok, then, I may just give it another go, w/ another episode ...",1362528000,,318,4.266666666666667
8096597,1,B000CBEX0A,"I LONGED for this show to be eventually released on dvd and here the first series is now available here to download or whatever the correct term is for this new craze. Not fair guys! I have been collecting old tv shows avidly for almost two years and knowing that dvd is being faded out, I am still saddened that shows such as this are being released here but the older guys like myself cant get to own them on dvd!!! Pllllllllleeeeeeeeease continue to release these shows on dvd untill its demise as that is where the true fanbase and the true monetary gain still is for a product of this sort. An Angry and very frustrated collector.",1337212800,,635,4.389830508474576
8096598,5,B000CBEX0A,"When I was a child this was my favorite program on TV but only if I could sit beside my dad to watch it because it scared me.  I was curious to once again see ""Man Against Crime"" and was surprised to find it available.  It was fun to watch and especially to compare a crime show from at least 50 years ago to what is on TV today.  Just for that reason I rated it as I did.  I only wanted it out of curiousity and it certainly did show me again what was on TV back then.  It gave me a chance to reminisce and remember days that were far less violent.",1261612800,2,549,3.780701754385965
