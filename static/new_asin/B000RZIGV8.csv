8203374,5,B000RZIGV8,"This couple of cops are mythic, Detective Lieutenant Mike Stone and his partner Inspector Steve Keller are not walking but rolling the streets of San Francisco chasing not petticoats or petty criminals but real hard core criminals who are ready to kill anyone, including their husbands or friends, though essentially weaker people, for a handful of dollars, for sums that today sound small but in those days sounded great like a few hundred thousand dollars or half a million dollars. It seems with these criminals the risk they take is more important than the profit they make. Yet they make that profit, or at least try to, they run their risks and they get caught by the ""villainous"" cops who are only there to get their heads, or at least their mugs, on their walls over their fireplaces, if they have a fireplace, because what's more these cops are poor and badly paid. Why on earth do they track boys and girls who make more money in one month than they do in a couple of decades? Because these cops are perverts and that is obvious from the very start. You have to be a pervert to arrest a criminal and find pleasure, pride and even fame in doing that. But these cops are bringing to the profession another dimension, a human and even humane dimension. They are moved into action  by the suffering of the people, by the social dimension of their cases, by the emotional and even sentimental sides of their situations. There is always a lot of love lost somewhere that is found again, or a lot of love that could have been lost and is retained. There is also a lesson about Pearl Harbor and about all kinds of jingoism or sectarianism or segregation or racism, or whatever that makes life and humanity dirty looking and mean sounding. Those two cops seem to be trying to create harmony, to be scoring some music and tuning all the voices of the big social choir to the one single pitch that could please human ears and from time to time divine ears, but not too much nor too many. The 50 odd minute episodes are not too long but are short enough to be packed and dense and that is an advantage, a good asset. The structure in four acts and one epilog is also rather nice though of course the format is becoming a limitation little by little. Some more complex cases cannot be solved in four little acts and one short epilog and fifty minutes is rather short on TV. But that was the format on TV in these late 60s and early 70s when color TV became popular. My first color TV in 1969 with Bonanza, Mission Impossible, Love American Style and so many other programs. That sure was another time and television was not an isolating tool yet but rather a machine around which people gathered and enjoyed some time together every night. A tremendous leap forward toward a culture for all and a social reflection for everybody and with everybody. So these programs had to be popular and police drama had to be close to people, close with a city like San Francisco that has always had a reputation to be friendly and easy going, with simple people who are severely hurt and maimed by crime and with some other people who suffer tremendously because of the consequences of the actions of criminals. That reveals though another type of courage, the courage to suffer in order to bring about justice and simple people who are the victims of such crimes are often willing to help justice rather than to get a vengeance. And Bonanza was the same and Mission Impossible was the same and Clint Eastwood and his spaghetti westerns were the same. It is not so much the cops themselves that bring peace to the community but the victims of crime that do and when one becomes a stray cat of justice and wants to be a vigilante or a pistolero or a gunslinger, then the whole universe reacts and brings that lost sheep back into the corral. OK Corral of course and more than Dead or Alive we want the criminals alive for the court and the judge and the jury. This series is still quite viewable and decent, and even emotional and at times slightly poignant. Quite different from the police dramas of today that are even shorter and definitely a lot gorier.

Karl Malden such a consummate actor and working so compassionately
with the gorgeous Michael Douglas. We so loved the series it did not disappoint. We hope to purchase the all episodes when they are available.

8203376,4,B000RZIGV8,"The only thing that keeps me from giving these shows 5 Stars is because so much local talent was utilized (yes, I know that was good for the actors and the economy) and it suffered from some pretty bad (i.e. hokey) acting with them. If you look back at some of the ""Dirty Harry"" movies, you'll notice a lot of these ""locals"" who acted in that series.

Other than that, it's always great to see all the locations in San Francisco and Daly City (where I lived) that were used as the backdrop of this great Crime Show. Living in the adjacent city and being born in San Francisco brought excitement every time I saw the show filming at locations I was passing by, or had heard they would be filming.

With a myriad of guest stars filling the weekly bill, the show was never short of ""talent."" And of course, kicking off ""Streets"" with one of the greatest and most recognizable themes helped a lot. I mean, who didn't love that fantastic Pat Williams chart with Tom Scott blazing on alto?",1234656000,,983,4.395604395604396

8203378,5,B000RZIGV8,"As a City of San Francisco aficionado, I was delighted to see the release of ""Streets of San Francisco"" and the DVD did not disappoint me.
Karl Malden and Michael Douglas are terrific actors, the guest stars in the episodes are all believable and solid, there are some great visual shots of The City (not as many as in season two), and the writing and plotting are as good (if not better) than any series produced now, about 35 years later.
Fans of the police TV series genre will (and should) snap this up, sit back and enjoy.",1216857600,,527,4.387755102040816
8203379,5,B000RZIGV8,"Streets of San Francisco was superior to most Quinn Martin detective shows, in part because of the great chemistry between its lead characters but also because a detective and sidekick always works better dramatically: the team of Holmes and Watson always worked better than solo detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, for example.  But far more mysterious than any of the Quinn Martin plot lines is why these outstanding TV shows have taken so long to be released on video.  In 1998 a handful of episodes were released only on VHS, even when that format had clearly been displaced by DVD.  And presumably the manufacturing cost of DVD is a fraction of VHS duplication, so this further adds to the mystery.  Even so, those VHS tapes were a vast improvement over the fuzzy, grainy, cut-for-more-commercial-time versions on TV rerun channels.  But this DVD set is better still.  The colors are bright and the titles are razor sharp.  It probably didn't look this good on first-run network TV.  The cover art says ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions,"" but I can see scenes that have been missing from reruns for many decades.  There are no DVD extras but there are English/Spanish Subtitles and a Spanish audio track. With only 4 discs, (on the Volume 1-2 set) and a list price of $80, the collection is grossly overpriced when more contemporary shows cost a half or a third that price, and almost always include some value-added content.  But if you're a SSF fan, it may well be worth the premium price.",1214784000,2,1534,4.798479087452471
