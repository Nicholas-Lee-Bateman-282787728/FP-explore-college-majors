The pace of this movie is slow at best and the 'Sexiness' is nowhere to be found! Also , this flick takes itself too seriously , it should realize it is a B movie and have fun with that fact and run with it. Not worth much more than a Dollar rental night at the local Vid Store.",994982400,3,437,3.8666666666666667

4185750,2,B003RRXTME,"I'm a little late to the party, but I was very disappointed with season 2.  I just could not believe the plot that the writers decided to pursue.  I know that the main actresses received other roles, but this show goes right along with the cliche lesbian trope and I can see why it was canceled after the second season.  Frankie reminds me a lot of Shane from The L Word, but I started becoming so invested in Frankie and Cat's story because Frankie actually started showing signs of becoming a better person for the one she truly loved.  Although I never think that cheating is right, I felt like maybe they would get a happy ending and make each other better.  Their ending really broke my heart, and I could not get past that particular episode and didn't even finish season 2.  I hope future shows will show more creativity in plots, and perhaps, even grant the main lesbian couple a happy ending with actresses dedicated enough to see the project through.",1497830400,,960,4.520231213872832

4185752,5,B003RRXTME,"I watched this series with my Prime subscription. Tho best as I can tell, only one cast memer is actually a lesbian, the characters, their story arcs, their love scenes (steamy!) all rang true. My only regret in  watching is that there were only 2 seasons. I do NOT agree with those reviewers who say the 2nd season did not live up to the first. In some ways, it was even more nuanced than the first. And it was interesting that the main characters in the 2nd season were not, with one exception, the main characters in the first. I heartily recommend this series, esp. for lesbians, but I think the character studies & stories are compelling for any viewer, straight or bent.",1493510400,4,676,4.495934959349594

4185755,4,B003RRXTME,"I must say, surprisingly I loved this show...but only season one. Just have to say that unfortunately season two was a big disappointment. The characters are all amazing, the kind you'd love to hang out with, and I happen to love Glasgow... awesome setting and interesting story full of relationship drama, and even a bit of mystery with Frankie's family...
I do recommend this to anyone, gay or not, (I'm not, but still loved it) just have in mind there are a few sex scenes, which I didn't mind, but still were a bit shocking for me. I loved the characters, all of them are quirky and sweet, and the acting is well above average. I especially loved Tess Roberts... she's the kind of fun party girl I'd love to have as a best friend!",1482624000,5,734,4.444444444444445

4185757,4,B003RRXTME,"Season 1 is great, right up there with the L word. Too bad season 2 is pure nonsense, and then it's just over. Still, definitely one of the better lesbian shows, and in its genre the first season earns 5 stars.  It was refreshing to see a more authentic lesbian experience (I'm looking at you Blue Is The Warmest Color), and I really liked the 3 main characters. However, I was really disappointed it started so strong and ended so strangely... Sort of like most of your friends from freshman year of college, they just disappear into the gray.",1474934400,4,544,4.494949494949495

The plots were amazing and the acting was WOW. lol I had never heard of this show before and just decided to give it a chance and I was hooked until the end.

It's bad business on Amazons end. Please make sure you know what you are selling. I'll be in touch. I spent my last bit if cash on this before school. I want to research this show! Hopefully I won't lose money on my investment. The writers and actors did a marvelous job at putting this show together.

4185766,3,B003RRXTME,"I bought this on a whim as it looked interesting. Put it on yesterday and couldn't stop watching it. Addictive. I cant comment on ppls reference to it being like or unlike L Word which ive only ever seen a few eps of. On the POSITIVE side Lipservice was funny,sexy, mmmmm hot :), poignant and with some real cringe worthy moments. But on the NEGATIVE i found that while it was addictive to watch it was like a sexy lesbian version of a day time soap. Like an Easterders goes gay..(ok ok i know Eastenders is an English show and Lipservice is set in Glasgow)The characters were two dimensional with unrealistic motivations, Frankie is the least appealing character of all...what a train wreck, run girls, run. Also some really unrealsitic sex sences..really...sex standing up? Ive never done that and a quick check with my large group of lesbian friends they hadnt either! Hey maybe we have had sheltered lives lol. Lastly i have to say after watching all 6 eps in one day i felt the need to go to an AA meeting and i hardly drink myself, please ppl give the alcohol a rest. I felt the constant alcoholism was a detraction from the real issues the show was trying to work on. Glasgow came across as a dingy, dark, wet slum where you have to be drunk out of your mind on a daily basis.",1353196800,,1283,4.417721518987341

4185768,5,B003RRXTME,"I recently purchased the Blu Ray version.  I live in the Boston, MA (USA) area and was able to play this with no problems.  I have a Toshiba BDX2150 Blu Ray player.  The disc appears to be region free.  The description states it is Region B in one part and Region A/B/C in another, so I figured I'd order it and give it a shot, and magically it works!  As for the content, this is an amazing show.  I'm sad that they only do 6 episodes per season.  However, they are an extraordinary 6 episodes.  I feel like they were able to accomplish so much more than The L Word.  I love The L Word, but compared to Lip Service, The L Word is pretty much a trashy, soap opera, haha!

4185780,5,B003RRXTME,"The BBC televised show Lip Service is very good. I have seen Lip Service on Netflix. I was amazed that Amazon sold the series, so I had to purchase it.

4185781,5,B003RRXTME,"I purchased the dvd recently to add to my TV/Movie DVD collection. The price is a bargain. After watching Lip Service through Hulu Plus (Netflix streams it too) I have been recommending it to all my friends, gay and straight. I think it is a well written, produced and performed show. The characters feel very familiar, like regular folks with common problems/issues such as family, friendship, career, love, trust, betrayal and grief. The series is beautifully filmed with high production values. The romantic love/sex scenes are authentic, daring and tastefully shot. The storyline in both Series One and Series Two ring true and should be viewed in proper order for story continuity and character development. Some people are calling Lip Service the UK L Word but I disagree. Lip Service stands apart with its own unique features. I think it is more edgy and grass roots compared to the slickness and glamour of the Los Angeles L Word. Glasgow Scotland looks much more fun and hip. I do hope more people view this show. It is refreshing, sexy and funny with sad bits as well.
Since the DVD's are region 2 format. You will need a multi-region DVD player or if you have a Mac computer, set iDVD to region 2 format viewing. Hope this helps.",1345766400,,1240,4.74537037037037
4185782,5,B003RRXTME,"It seems that a lot of people compare this show to our version of ""The L Word.""  In truth I've never seen ""The L Word""  before.  However, I saw the reviews it was getting on here and what it had gotten on Netflix, and I figured ""sure.  I'll give it a shot!""  After adjusting the slightly different way tv shows are written and directed to ours (a minor difference, but significant enough to me a movie buff) and having let the characters develop I COULD NOT TEAR my eyes away from this tv show!!  It was just AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My favorite character in this show is hands down is Frankie.  She's so awesome and brings so much to this show!!!!! In truth, it was her character that made me wanna continue to watch this and I did.  She's smart, funny, a closet romantic, and just a wild woman expressing herself in one way that she knows very well.  Needless to say, she's just awesome!!  May not deal with things in the same way I do, but we're all human and we all make mistakes.  And the character Frankie has had that reputation in her past, as it haunts parts of her future.
I cannot tell you how many people I've recommended to see this show, but I really hope that they continue to have a season three and that they bring Frankie back in it!!  She gives the show a liveliness, that although I like the other characters such as Tess and Ed, and Lexy, it just wasn't the same without Frankie.  It was still good, don't get me wrong.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you see this if you've not already.  I'm shocked that there aren't more reviews for this show.  Word clearly hasn't spread out far enough yet to get peoples attention.  I'm hoping that at some point this will change and that they see what it is we're talking about.

4185783,5,B003RRXTME,"""Lip Service"" was fantastic. I checked it out on a whim and now that I've seen it, I am shocked more people don't talk about this show. It certainly achieves far more than ""The L Word"" could. Great actresses, fascinating characters, provocative scenes (that boldly go where The L Word somehow failed to tread), and really witty engaging dialogue. This show was great, I highly recommend Season 1. NOTE: Stay far far away from Season 2, it's awful, the total antithesis of everything that worked the first time around.

Cat which I didn't realize was in a lesbian movie called Ninas Heavenly Delight just before she did Lip Service, Im assuming? I haven't seen the movie yet!!

If I were a real lesbian Id have a hard time picking between Shane from the L Word or Frankie from Lip Service; hm, let me see here??? Overall show is pretty good but if show was longer with more episodes I wouldnt know which lady Cat should end up being with, Sam the hot cop or Frankie?",1508112000,,588,4.444444444444445
8403847,3,B003RRXTME,"99% SPOILER FREE

The first thing you should know about Lip Service is that it was cancelled after Season 2 was completed, so the Season 2 finale was written with the expectation that the various interconnected storylines would be continued.  As a result, be prepared for unresolved emotional cliffhangers before the final fade to black.

Dont expect any serious explorations of LGBTQ identity or social issues, although in moments the show at least makes a few well-intentioned attempts.  There is the standard film and television focus on femme to androgynous but still traditionally pretty women obviously designed to appeal to the broadest possible mainstream heterosexual audience.

All of the actors turn in solid performances, and each of the characters and overall ensemble is certainly appealing.  But quite a few of the writing and editing choices feel kind of schizophrenic, especially in Season 2.  (I suspect that there might have been too many cooks in the kitchen at the BBC.)  While this is obviously a romantic erotic dramedy, several incredibly heavy moments are jarringly intercut with goofy silly fluff, and significant time is spent developing characters and storylines only to have them disappear suddenly without any kind of a satisfying resolution, not even taking into account the abrupt ending due to the cancellation of the show.

While I wasn't personally bothered by this, it might be an issue for some, so I think that its worth mentioning that there are a A LOT of depictions of casual cocaine use.  This struck me as a little odd, although Im not a 20-something living in Glasgow, so I don't know if maybe this was just a reflection of what was happening there at the time the show was being produced.

Lip Service feels like a cross between a nighttime adult soap opera and a pop music video.  Worth a look if you're in the mood for glossy softcore lesbian escapism and you're also willing to moderate your expectations for a satisfying narrative.",1507248000,,1980,4.984802431610942
