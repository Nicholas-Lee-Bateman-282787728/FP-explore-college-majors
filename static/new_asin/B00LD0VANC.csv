6479630,4,B00LD0VANC,"This is second to the Raid 2 as my favorite Asian action film this year,fantastic fight scenes ,good leading character and villain, excellent back story and the pacing of the film kept you from being bored! The western theme of the film gave it more epic style and reminded you of a spaghetti western with the use of that type of music in the movie which I loved, also it had a Shaw brothers look and feel to it as well,very good popcorn flick, don't wait for word of mouth about this movie take a chance and let yourself be entertained ,you will not be disappointed if are fan of this type of film .",1412380800,6,600,4.226086956521739

6479633,5,B00LD0VANC,Fantastic 19th century Korean film. Great detailed character development for the hero's and the villains with exciting sword fights. Strong western vibe throughout the film which I liked.,1412380800,7,187,5.714285714285714

6479636,4,B00LD0VANC,"I loved the movie, but was very turned off by the translated sub-titles.  Find it hard to believe a period piece like this would have so many of today's profanities and vulgarities.  It's not that I have all that much against that kind of language, but in this context, it just sounded stupid!

Also the music was more suited to a spaghetti western in places.  Again, it just didn't go with the culture or time period of the subject matter.

Other than that, the action, cinematography and actors were great!",1521417600,,508,4.6
6479637,3,B00LD0VANC,"The movie was entertaining all the way up to a certain character's first attempt at revenge and then after that I started losing interest. The villain was multi-faceted and kudos to the writers for allowing us to see why he became what he did. I'm still not sure why the Captain wasn't the main hero of the story. I like him much more than the butcher.

Acting was superb.  The villagers really did well.  This must be based on a true story because what there was of a plotline sucked.  The redeeming factor was the villain.  He turned out to be a really interesting guy.  I wish he had won.",1511049600,,288,4.320754716981132
6479639,1,B00LD0VANC,"Greetings community,

  My recent natural review could not be posted because I broke certain guidelines, yet managed to say truthful to  the extent of my disappointment of receiving a dvd that was broke. I wanted to clarify that when your excited to receive merchandise. Euphoric aloof elixir of promise. I expected what I paid for and don't want anyone getting used by anyone.

6479653,2,B00LD0VANC,"It was going great until around the end when unrealisticness started to overwhelm the final battle against Jo-yoon, the films main villain.

It seemed like Jo-yoon was incredibly skilled with his sword, so much so, that it began to look like he must have powers as well as protection from the evil Gods, and therefore the action sequences of the story lost some authenticity. He was undefeatable even fighting against many men, arrows coming at him in all directions, and even swinging his sword in his defense, while holding a baby in his one other arm. His luck was just so ridiculously unrealistic in his favor.

That and it wouldn't hurt if the film could have been a little shorter.

Oh well, I watched it twice this past year.  I don't think I'd ever watch it again.",1458000000,2,772,4.613138686131387

6479658,1,B00LD0VANC,"The swordplay and fist action was slightly above average. Seen better in ""Fearless"" and ""War of the Arrows"".
But really puzzled nobody has mentioned anything about the background accompanying music soundtrack
that follows each action set piece, or other parts of the movie.
It was simply horrible and out of place.
At times, it sounded like it was copied from some 60's cheap spagetti western movie, at other times it sounded
like some tune from a 50's Chicago sleazy bar with saxophones and trombones blowing away.
Man!!  This is a period Korean movie.
Such background scores will totally took all credibility and reality away from any viewer trying to be immersed
in such films.
Couldn't they have played some old classical Korean music? What was the director thinking?  Maybe, he thought
he was making an epic Western film. Or was he just poking fun at his audience?
This totally took me out of the movie. Imagine the new James Bond ""Spectre"" movie with accompanying Indian
Bollywood music throughout, or the coming Captain America ""Civil War"" with accompanying Chinese opera music
from start to end.
You'll get the point.",1444262400,,1125,4.9787234042553195

6479665,3,B00LD0VANC,"Set in 1862, Korea, the last days of the Joseon Dynasty, Kundo: Age of the Rampant (Kundo: Min-ran-eui si-dae) is a period action drama about a pack of bandits who fight against the corrupt ruling class, but the films overall tone is more similar to that of Western movie. As an action movie, that itself is not a bad thing.

Kundo has several martial arts action set-pieces that are reasonably entertaining, but the real driving force of the film is the riveting performances from Jung-woo Ha as the vengeful butcher-turned-bandit Dolmuchi, and Dong-won Kang as the deadly swordsman Jo-yoon, who is a noblemans son.

The problem is, unlike Django Unchained, Yoon Jong-bins film does not allow us to relate to the hero of the convoluting story. We are supposed to cheer for the bandits and Dolmuchi who joins them, but with too many characters, not enough fleshed out, I couldn't care less for any of them.

The 137-minute saga could have been more intense and emotionally involving had filmmakers focused the conflict between Dong-won Kang and Jung-woo Has characters.",1432080000,3,1069,4.960893854748603

6479677,3,B00LD0VANC,"A tale of revenge and rise against injustice. The cast is good, the action decent and everything is it should be I suppose. But somehow I thought this film just average. Something didn't click. I wouldn't call it a waste of time, especially if you like period action but it is not as good as say, War of the Arrows or The Masquarade. My favorite in the film is the villain. Not that it was a good villian (a bir cartoonish and insane but the actor, Kang Dong Won looked really good. Beautiful from every angle and wonderful in period garb. All in all I would only cautiously recommend it to the people who are into this type of film.",1422403200,,633,4.283333333333333

6479683,5,B00LD0VANC,"My friend and I had just finished watching Netflix's MARCO POLO season 1, which was very worth while. Last night, we were feeling lost. Where would we go to get our next fix of Asian war and martial arts. That was when we came upon this little hidden gem. It had a solid rating, and sounded funky. We said, ""why the hell not?""

We were blown away! The movie seems to be influenced by many different genres, and quickly reminded us of Braveheart meets Robin Hood, but with much more depth and cunning. Many different techniques are at play here as the story unfolds, and you are taken on a rather brutal and involving ride. This movie has gangsta attitude and style without being corny or over-the-top. I can see Quentin Tarantino just drooling in awe of this movie as I was. It even felt like the groovy kind of music he would have used for this film.

The fight scenes are vicious and intense. The dialogue is sharp and well-acted. The villain is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie like this. About halfway through this movie, I turned to my friend and told him I will need to see everything this director ever puts out. With hints of the familiar, Yoon Jong-bin has twisted Kundo into something totally fresh, and thrilling.

PS- Kundo uses subtitles, which some people turn their noses up about, but I think it is the only way to go!",1420502400,13,1345,4.415322580645161
6479684,2,B00LD0VANC,"I thought this movie was about 1 hour longer than it should have been.  Also, what was with all of the penis humor and curse words?  I really just don't know what to make of this movie.

Epic swordsman of justice as imagined by a teenager who vandalized my time with his overdeveloped plot and lack of discretion.

The Transformers of Kung Fu films!

Might be worth watching once if you really like violence and have nothing else valuable to do with your time.  I'd recommend buying a bag of chips and re watching an old Jet Li or Jackie Chan film instead.

6479691,3,B00LD0VANC,"Kundo is based on a real uprising against the corrupt ruling class in the 19th-century Korea.  It would have been an excellent movie if it had been a bit shorter, leading to a tighter storyline, and eliminated the narrator, who interfered with the flow.

6479693,5,B00LD0VANC,"This film finally captures the visceral history of an almost forgotten era in Korea.  Pitting the good against the bad, the peasant against the aristocrat KUNDO captures it in minute detail.  At well over two hours you have to stay with the film, understand the multitude of personalities, and enjoy the over the top action, but it is really worth it.  From start to finish this film will keep you at times on the edge of your seat as you worry about those characters you have come to appreciate, and the villainous ones you will also find yourself at times rooting for especially the bastard son who runs the country, and its people with a callous ruthless behavior which at times has you staring in disbelief or hitting the repeat button to watch his hatred filled delivery all over again.  For action fans the fight scenes are simply superb both one on one and many against many.

8665246,5,B00LD0VANC,"The story is very well told over the span of a few years with a stellar cast, and great acting. I loved every character but the villain was so good in this movie, he is probably my villain of the year! His hair and clothes were so well done, and his acting flawless. Some of the fight scenes were simply impressive, and I had to pick my jaw off the floor a few times. It had plenty of funny moments, great cinema, lots of actions and there's even some history to this movie. I liked the Western touch, it took on its own Korean historic movie direction with that, borrowing a bit from the Westerns, some interesting graphics at the beginning, and some of the usual Korean movie elements (like the swearing, emotional reach, etc). A really good movie, definitely worth watching.",1529798400,,777,4.47887323943662
