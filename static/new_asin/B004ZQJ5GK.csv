4510679,5,B004ZQJ5GK,"I love this movie. I Dont Understand, how this movie could have bad reviews. It is Very Original, and is very creepy! It doesn't have that ""Generic"" Feel, like ALOT of Low Budget movies tend to have. If you like B Movies, or Any horror movies, you will love this movie.",1320883200,3,269,4.294117647058823
4510680,4,B004ZQJ5GK,"Goblin starts pretty much like so many low budget horrors these days: Way back when, a sacrifice goes wrong, witch gets angry, curse put on town. Boom, teens with great hair die. But there's a little more story and a little more character in Goblin. It's certainly routine, but action keeps coming, the Goblin is well designed (mostly because it's under a hooded cape 80 percent of the time), and a lot of it happens in broad daylight. Imagine that! A horror movie in daylight! Anyway, i found a lot of the characters interesting, and i didn't see some of the plot twists coming, which was fun. Not one to own, but a decent rental.",1314489600,2,631,4.495652173913044
4510681,1,B004ZQJ5GK,"Positive:
The acting portrayal of a drunk (alcohol challenged) from - guess. Past encounter with it.

Negatives:
Acting: For everyone else the worst wooden acting of the past two years.

Plot: Tiresome old witch hunt gone bad (except everyone spoke such contemporary grammatically correct English - how foresightful of them!) Really cheap CG of the stereotypic demon horned goat with spindly arms. You would think with all that power he would try a different persona - maybe a Jackalope. But the bizarre part is how he decided to disguise himself in a friar's cloak - what an original disguise. Then the cloak flies off but looked more like a wire attached to a piece of fabric with a fan blowing and a green screen in the background. Scary!
Usual addition of a few teen flirting episodes for more audience.
Demon teeth - might be the highlight? Popular the past few years is the addition of Piranha looking teeth but is now getting really old and unimaginative. Teeth were the scariest part of the demon. Even the cover, which doesn't look like him is scarier.

Props and sets: The usual cabin in the woods and usual ways to die with lots of fake blood and a few internal organs. Same old running and screaming.",1313625600,,1212,4.68075117370892
4510682,5,B004ZQJ5GK,Thank you for sending the movie on time!  I will report my thoughts on this movie after I view it. Thanks again.,1313193600,,112,4.090909090909091
4510683,2,B004ZQJ5GK,"Judge Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict -- ""Goblin is a film hamstrung by a distinct lack of invention which, it seems, is a direct result of a lack of funds. For when Goblin isn't focusing on the eponymous beastie, it flounders for ways to flesh out its running time. So, in the place of real scares and a memorable screen bogeyman, we get to spend the first half of the film enjoying the Perkins' family's problems play out on screen. Occasionally--usually just about in time to remind the viewer that they are actually watching a horror movie--the film remembers to bring up the curse, usually by replaying the film's opening sequence whilst one of the yokels recounts the tale. The most obvious failing of Goblin is writer Raul Inglis' decision to turn what could have been a vaguely interesting supernatural tale into a teen slasher movie. Make no mistake: despite the paranormal element to the film, there's nothing fantastical about the onscreen events. If it weren't for the occasional shot of the goblin's face (a poorly rendered CGI creation if ever I saw one), it could be pretty much anyone underneath the black cowl he wears (to cover the shoddy special effects) while chasing teen girls through the woods. The film's emphasis on gore over atmosphere is a huge and ultimately fatal mistake. I appreciate a good dollop of gore as much as the next man (as long as he likes gore by the barrel full), but a horror movie--particularly a low-budget release--should, nay must, put an emphasis on creating a foreboding air of menace. Too often events are played out in broad daylight, when everyone knows that effective use of shadows and the unseen are key to raising tension levels. Put simply, there is nothing even remotely frightening about Goblin, which lacks even cheap jump scares to quicken the viewer's pulse. For those familiar with other titles from the Syfy Original Movies stable, Goblin should offer few surprises, being a similarly uninspired effort. It is a cheap, clich&eacute;-ridden slice of genre cinema that drags from start to finish, and though that may suit late-night cable TV, it has no place in your DVD collection.""",1310256000,,2143,4.8901098901098905
4510684,5,B004ZQJ5GK,"Filmed in the deep woods of British Columbia, 2010's ""Goblin"" tells the story of a cursed forest hamlet wherein an extremely tall and malicious goblin appears every Halloween to kill newborns in the town and anyone else who may get in the way.

Unlike joke-horror films like ""Cabin Fever"", ""Goblin"" takes the material totally serious with zero camp or goofiness. This is the way monster movies should be done. After all, once an element of goofiness is introduced it's no longer possible to take the film serious and therefore impossible to be horrified by the events, which is one of the main purposes of horror movies.

I was impressed with the quality of the acting & writing, particularly for a low-budget TV movie. The characters are not one-dimensional; they're written as believable human beings and the actors, professionals that they are, are able to follow suit.

This one has all the mandatory staples of a deep woods horror flick -- gorgeous babes, gorgeous babes fleeing in terror, gorgeous babes fleeing in terror with titillating clothing (I'm just having fun so don't take me too seriously, lol), youthful romantic liaisons, creepy malicious monster, good characters to root for, particularly the father (Gil Bellows) and his family/friends.

The ""gorgeous babes"" include the main protagonist Tracy Spiridakos, blond cutie Erin Boyes and Julia Maxwell, the latter clad in a hot-goth-girl costume with sexy stockings & high heels (no wonder the Goblin goes after her!). Bellow's wife in the story, Camille Sullivan, also deserves an honorable mention.

Speaking of the monster, aren't goblins supposed to be small-ish creatures? Not so here. The goblin in this movie is close to 7' tall and has the ability to teleport. When he's fully revealed in the final ten minutes he looks too-obviously CGI and Grade-B Pumpkinhead, but throughout most of the film he appears in a cool black hooded robe, which makes him somehow more mysterious, gothic and eerie. The fact that he emits a horrible stench is an excellent touch.

One critic on the internet criticized the film on the grounds of ""the reasoning behind the random killings is terrible. If the thing hunts babies why's it laying waste to random people with no babies? Totally retarded."" My response: The goblin's prime directive is to kill babies in light of the curse and because infants represent undefiled new life and potential. As for laying waste to random people, the old man clearly points out near the end that, because the goblin hunts babies, it sniffs out the scent of infants on any person who's been near one; hence, his attraction to the girls who were babysitting the baby Nathan. The goblin is obviously a demon, a minion of the devil, do you think a demon is going to spare the life of anyone who gets in its way? What's the pupose of demons anyway? To ""kill, steal and destroy"". Hence, the goblin was excited at the prospect of extra people to terrify and kill.

On the downside: Although the story takes place during Halloween, it's obviously summertime (look at the kid's clothes and the foliage, etc.). Also, the climax with the car and spear is rather roll-your-eyes. But these negatives are minor in view of the entire film.

FINAL WORD: Make no mistake, despite being a TV film, ""Goblin"" is a standout deep woods monster flick. The goblin is actually frightning and the protagonists are so believable and three-dimensional that you care about them, and are literally shocked when the monster tears them to pieces.

GRADE: A

ENDNOTE: On another site a reviewer accused me of somehow being involved in the production of ""Goblin"" since I gave it a ""glowing review."" The truth is I had nothing to do with this production or any other film production. I'm not in the business. I write amateur reviews simply because I like to write and share my views. Secondly, I had no qualms about pointing out the film's (minor) flaws. Regardless, I stand by my review. I evaluate films according to what they are and aspire to be. No genre is beyond redemption or beneath contempt. In this case ""Goblin"" is low-budget TV monster flick and I rated it accordingly.",1306195200,17,4137,4.880341880341881
8450387,5,B004ZQJ5GK,This video is not the scariest I've seen but it definitely took you to a nightmarish stage.,1500595200,,91,4.411764705882353
8450388,4,B004ZQJ5GK,"I wish the goblin in the movie looked like the fabulous creature depicted on the DVD cover but it doesn't.  Instead, there's a flying cloak that occasionally takes on some cartoon features when it stands upright.  As for the plot, it's fairly routine.  A family with a baby is lured to a small settlement out in the middle of nowhere (picture an occasional building surrounded by forest).  You have to travel some distance to get from one place to another.  Very few townsfolk are ever shown, sans babies of any kind.  Because once upon a time, there was a curse delivered by an angry witch loathed to have her baby burned in a bonfire.  Seems a little nitpicky as they were simply trying to do away with anything deemed harmful to their community.  They also tossed corn, rotten apples, and a locust into these self-same flames.  They were blights and one can't have blights and expect to still be pretty!  Fast forward to present day when no one is receiving any gifts.  Cell phones don't work.  Some snarky teens show up in time to meet the resident cloak on a rampage.  Before you can say ""what just happened here,"" people are dying and the only baby for miles around goes missing.  Something evil is afoot and it's not just the goblin.

Except for some unfortunate casting problems and the aforementioned mishap while trying to design a believable (never mind scary) goblin, not a bad little effort.  It was dopey.  I liked it.  Naturally, I was rooting for the baby.",1432252800,,1472,4.617760617760617

8450390,3,B004ZQJ5GK,"Acting was decent. I liked the locations used; they were very realistic which made for a creepy atmosphere. It takes a while for the goblin to show up, but the characters were developed during that time. Overall, a better-than-average monster flick.",1410393600,,249,5.097560975609756
8450391,4,B004ZQJ5GK,This product came in on time but have still not had a chance to watch it yet. What I was able to read about it made it seem fairly good so I am definitely looking forward to viewing it.,1394668800,,185,3.769230769230769

8450393,5,B004ZQJ5GK,I found this gem at WOW! i was blown away by how good it was. Interesting from start to finish...no sex scenes...nudity...or bad language...about time.,1370476800,,151,5.08
8450394,5,B004ZQJ5GK,Goblin has blood and gore in it and dabs a little bit into witchery and spells.  Not for the weak or people who have little babies (which is what this movie is about).  I enjoyed the movie and have added it to my collection.,1356825600,,224,4.068181818181818
8450395,3,B004ZQJ5GK,Got it because I like horror movies. Plus Tracy Spiridakos is in it. She is so Beautiful that alone made me want to get it.,1355011200,,123,3.96
8450396,5,B004ZQJ5GK,"first off I did not buy it from amazon. and paid waaaayy to much..had some time to burn so I  bought it at the mall..movie is worthy for what it is priced at on amazon..which gives it 5 star entry.. creature on cover looks nothing like the one in the movie.. didn't care much for the cover . I figured it was in mid transformation or something..yeah, I tend to over think things...movie creature looks more goblinnish.. enjoyed the way the creature moved about..it gave the movie a very Halloweeny feel to it. I would have limited the CGI to action scenes..forged a cool costume & puppet props kinda like what they used in the movie ""The last Lovecraft"" ( though with a Goblin design)..movie consist of creature, family guy w/ wife & baby, creepy town folk, and stupid teenage victims in love, and a annoying real estate agent..what more could you ask for..( a little Popcorn and a ice tea)the kill scenes were decent not Boring or predictable. The creature makes up for some of the less talented actors..overall I thought the team that put this movie together did a great job.. with the budget they probably had to work with. I thought it was a valient effort. I hope the team that put this together continue to put more movies out..5 star for the B-Genre..if you liked this check out ""Creature of Darkness"" and if you want something with a heavier dose of Gore check out ""Evil Aliens "" uncut..",1329436800,2,1395,4.535714285714286
