I got an idea! I put it in my computer - and voila! It plays through Windows Media Player. The wonderful thing about this series was all the wonderful guest stars and the characters they got to play!

In ""Nobody"" - nobody is Mobeetie, an orphan who was adopted by cowhands. As a child, they put a cowbell around his neck so he wouldn't get lost. He's an irascible character. He drives you crazy, but you like him - similar to Lummy in ""The Search.""

It's hot in Cimarron, and there's a trainload of dynamite stuck in the middle of town. How is Crown going to keep it from being blown up?",1341100800,3,741,4.316546762589928
8217059,4,B000V78NKG,"Here's an episode of the great TV western Cimarron Strip from the mid-to-late 1960s. There are more episodes listed, but I'll write of this one disc only. It stars Stuart Whitman and I would have given it a five star review only it's not viewable on US DVD players!  Not to worry.... order yourself a ""Region free"" player and order the series from Amazon.co.uk.  How come the Brits get this and we Americans don't????  Terrific series. Wait.... maybe it'll be released here, or maybe it'll be deleted in Britain and never be offered again. And what a shame because Whitman is still alive and could do an interview and commentary. The US DVD ""Deciders"" are just plain nuts!!
