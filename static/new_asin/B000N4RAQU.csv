2756213,5,B000N4RAQU,This double feature was a dream come true because these two movies are awesome wes craven movies the people under the stairs and shocker this set just blew my mind when i saw that they brought it out they said that a lot of people didn't like it but read the reviews every loves it on Amazon and i have two VHS copys of the people under the stairs becauses i bought the one at a video store and it didn't last that long because i watched it all the time i also have shocker on VHS but you won't find shocker in more on dvd because it's out of print they said on the internet that they are making remakes but they can't beat the original ones,1400716800,,641,4.015625

Funny movie she loves so glad I could get it.",1391299200,,135,4.230769230769231
2756225,5,B000N4RAQU,"These two movies are classic slasher/thriller movies, for slasher movie fans, shocker is for you, and for thriller movie fans, The people under the stairs is for you, these 2 movies get 5 out of 5 stars, I recommend them both for all movie fans.",1377993600,,245,4.466666666666667
2756226,3,B000N4RAQU,"First you have the people under the stairs; You have a scary house, you have Crazy people that live there that may be rich, you have a few people wanting to break in and steal some of these riches.  That's the basic plot of this 80's Horror movie.  I personally did not find this movie scary at all I found it ""Funny"" and it was entertaining to that fact.  The plot was typical for wes craven.  If your looking to be entertained then this movie should suit you on a nostalgic night.

Next you have shocker; I was shocked on how horrible this movie was done, the story has been done before, the plot was very thin even for a 80's horror flick and/or a Wes Craven film.  This movie thrives on the one liners typical for 80's horror movies, but over all it was worth the nostalgia.

Both films are crazy (IMO) both are rated R for obvious reasons and if your looking for a little 80's nostalgia then here ya go.",1370044800,,908,4.213872832369942
2756227,4,B000N4RAQU,"The DVD combo pack is a good idea, especially for the price! I only wanted ""The People Under the Stairs"" but I saw it was only $1 more (on amazon.com) with ""Shocker"" included & I'd never seen it before, so for only $1 more, why not?!

The DVDs: Both DVDs work & play perfectly, I didn't have a single issue with either one. This is a great addition for all horror fans!

The People Under the Stairs: I saw this movie at a very young age, much younger than I should've seen it at, so I had nightmares for MONTHS. When I was old enough & got the courage to attempt watching it again, I rather enjoyed it. It's a tad long, but overall it's entertaining, it has a creepy premise which holds your attention. It's quite different (in my opinion) from Wes Craven's other work, but this is definitely in my top 3 for Craven flicks.

Shocker: This one was interesting for me, it's not my favorite but I'm a horror fan, so I had to watch it. I don't know that I'd watch it again, but when you think about it, it only cost me $1, which is more than half the price of a movie rental & who wants to watch the not-so-great quality version on YouTube. I'll give it another shot sooner or later.",1365638400,2,1179,4.162280701754386

2756231,5,B000N4RAQU,"This is one of Wes Craves better horror movies and since it's a two for one deal, then you are really sure o get your money's worth. I would highly recommend this to the horror lovers.",1343692800,,184,4.138888888888889
2756232,5,B000N4RAQU,I loved The People Under the Stairs when it originally came out-and love getting two for one. Can't beat getting a great buy in two dvds!,1334016000,,137,4.3076923076923075
2756233,4,B000N4RAQU,"I couldn't find my DVD of ""Shocker"", so upon looking to purchase a new copy, I noticed it was even cheaper to buy this double feature rather then buy it separately. I figured if ""the people under the stairs"" was no good, it would be no loss at all, but man, was I surprised at how awesome that movie was.

This double feature of two of Wes Cravens best is well worth the bit of pocket change it costs to purchase. The People Under The Stairs is a classic I have just discovered, about a deranged brother and sister who own a mansion just outside of the ghetto that has had strange stories told about it for many, many years. A young boy from the ghetto is threatened to have his family evicted from their apartment, all because his mother is dying of cancer and cannot afford the rent or money for her operation. He is told by a guy that a house just outside the hood is supposed to have a rare collection of coins inside that are worth millions. He teams up with the man and his partner in crime in attempt to get inside the house and find the coins. But once inside, something is very strange. The weirdo brother and sister who own it are completely insane and what else inside the house is something you will have to see the movie to enjoy. Overall, I can't beleive I have never seen this movie before, and it was well worth the purchase.

Shocker is a movie where Horace Pinker (played by Skinner from X-files) is a serial killer who kills a guys family and his girlfriend, however the guy dreams of when Horace is killing and is able to help police capture Horace and send him to the electric chair. But what they did not expect was Horace practices black magic and manages to make a deal with a demon (I guess) who allows Horace to become something more after death. He comes back as a type of entity/ghost thing that can become a physical force, and his killings continue while the guy has the finger pointed at him for murder as Pinker is supposed to be dead, but still lurking through people (like possession of sorts) or traveling through anything electric. It reminds me of a bit of Nightmare on Elm st with a reverse twist, as in if Freddys dream power is now on the side of good. It also has a great hard-rock soundtrack supplied by Desmond Child who got together a few Kiss, Alice Cooper and Megadeath (or is that Iron Maiden?) songs. It also features an attempt at a super-band which consisted of Paul Stanly, Alice Cooper, Tommy Lee and a few others who write the movies soundtrack theme. A pretty awesome idea and attempt, and a shame this was the only light of day that group saw.

Unfortunately the only reason I can't give these movies together a perfect 5 stars is the lack of any bonus features. I would love to hear some behind the scenes, commentary or deleted scenes from either of these two movies. But oh well, it's still a great priced DVD set for any horror fan to enjoy. (however, don't expect dark horror or gore, thats not what Wes Craven does, if you enjoy Nightmare on Elm St/Scream/Friday The 13th etc.. then these movies should be right up your alley.",1328659200,4,3087,4.3652173913043475

8174819,5,B000N4RAQU,"I mainly purchased this duel movie set because the one movie ""people under the stairs"" features the two actors from the cult television series twin peaks. the other movie is really great as well and a rather unique story at best. a convicted criminal gets the electric chair and comes back as a evil electric entity.

both movies are directed and written by wes craven the man behind the nightmare on elm street series and creating one of the most iconic horror icons ""freddy Kruger"". both movies have that mixture of horror and humor which at times is either a hit or a miss. it seems to work for both movies",1469232000,,609,4.486486486486487

8174824,1,B000N4RAQU,"Another typical dvd reissue by Universal with no extras of course waste of money
if your big fan of both People under the stairs and Shocker
you must get Scream factory's blu-ray versions of both films

and the picture quality does look amazing very nice sharp & clear transfers much better than this old dvd version
plus both blu-ray versions have new special features, something Universal wouldn't bother to give
the People under the stairs has new interviews with some of the cast from the film
and new Audio commentaries, 2 commentaries, 1st one is by Wes craven, 2nd is by Director of Photography Jacques waitkins
plus Vintage making of featurette, Stills Gallery, TV spots, original trailer etc
Shocker has been given new special features aswell,new interviews, new commentaries
check it out for yourself, type in Shocker or people under the stairs blu-ray in amazon search bar you'll see what i mean

1 star for this new dvd, 5 stars for the blu-ray versions",1441756800,,1149,4.83248730964467
