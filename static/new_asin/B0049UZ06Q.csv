8419441,5,B0049UZ06Q,"There is no manual for life and how to deal with the good and bad.  ""A Fighting Chance"" star Kyle Maynard is able to provide a lifestyle blueprint for able-bodied or handicapped people to live productive lives.  Living without limbs for his whole life, he is able to convey his experience and knowledge in how to break down that perception of being broke to everyone.  Kyle stated ""Everyone has a disability; you are the only one that can set limits upon yourself.""  What is great about this documentary is that you feel no pity for Kyle; instead he inspires and motivates even able bodied people.  If he can do it, then there is no reason I cannot do it.",1290124800,2,655,4.470588235294118

8419443,5,B0049UZ06Q,"Saw this film on ESPN recently, Kyle Maynard is a superb athlete and has the trophies to prove it. He's also someone who rises to any challenge - particularly those he sets for himself.  When I first heard that Kyle, born without lower arms or legs, was going to have a MMA cage fight against an able bodied fighter, I thought the idea was nuts. This film tells you what happened - what was required in body and spirit from Kyle to get into the ring, and what he has done with the experience. Watching him work with wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan creates one of the most moving scenes you'll ever see.  Kyle's motto is ""No Excuses"". Nobody lives his motto more completely. Buy this film and share it with your friends and family - There are No Excuses.",1290038400,4,764,4.411347517730497
