8273315,2,B0019BIXUI,"I was very excited to get this video as I am working on a 67 Mustang Fastback and this video is of a 68 Fastback. The video was shipped very quickly and was well packaged, but my excitement very quickly diminished as I began to watch. It is advertised as a ""True Instructional DVD"" but it is nothing of the sort. At best it is a quick over view of how to paint a car, with little to no detail. At worst it is an advertisement for the body shops products. Most topics are simply glossed over, with the majority of the video simply showing a technician performing a task, but with no real commentary or in depth explanation of why or what they are doing. I mean how much depth can they go into in 50 minutes. I did not realize it was so short when I purchased the video. It is well filmed and the picture is very clear, however I would avoid this video simply for the lack of content. If you want to see a ""True Instructional DVD"" on automotive paint and body work, you should really look into the Paintucation series with Kevin Tetz.",1247702400,9,1032,4.190954773869347
