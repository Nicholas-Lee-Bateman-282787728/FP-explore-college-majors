7724802,5,B01DUVP8B6,"The female lead roles in this film need correcting. Female Leads: Rheagan Wallace (Julia), Miriam Holmlund (Jessica) and Rachel Truitt (Erin) are not mentioned as starring in Blue Family. A big mistake, since they carried the entire story along with male lead actor, Guillermo Ivan (Armando). Many very intense scenes in this film were well acted by all the lead and supporting actors. I plan to purchase 2 Blu Ray copies and hope it does very well on Amazon!",1462665600,2,459,4.822784810126582

7724811,4,B01DUVP8B6,"It's based on a true story, of which make for good movies.  It's sad what a man will do to have the company of the opposite sex. But justice prevails in the end.",1471392000,4,161,3.878787878787879
7724812,2,B01DUVP8B6,It wasn't that good,1471132800,2,19,4.0
7724813,1,B01DUVP8B6,I'm rating this low because the subject matter is so disturbing and so against women it's hard to watch and I would rather not promote this vile sick subject.,1471132800,2,158,4.482758620689655
8756925,4,B01DUVP8B6,"This is like a spin off and  based on the true story  of the guy in Ohio that held the 3 girls for 10 yrs in his home, which later a  movie was made called The Clevand Abduction. I have to say this was not bad, a little low budget, some bad acting at times, but worth a watch. This is really sad and scary that this is happening out there in this world we live in. Woman beware and besafe.",1535673600,,389,3.7777777777777777

8756927,3,B01DUVP8B6,"While it's not what most would call a ""great movie"". It does shed a bit of light on it's targeted subject.
Women be careful; there are a lot of creeps out there.",1519603200,,161,4.0625
8756928,4,B01DUVP8B6,Not bad.,1500854400,,8,3.5
8756929,3,B01DUVP8B6,"As mentioned ""bad accent"" problems. Also the story makes you wonder how much artistic license was used on this verses the Ohio story",1497916800,,132,4.782608695652174
8756930,3,B01DUVP8B6,"had a good look about it, but was a little too leisurely paced for me. Acting was hit and miss.",1490227200,2,95,3.8

8756932,1,B01DUVP8B6,"This film is much much too dark for my tastes, and I can handle some heavy stuff.  I did not like this movie at all.  Sorry, but it just totally bummed me out, and I could only watch the half of it.",1481846400,4,198,3.6904761904761907
