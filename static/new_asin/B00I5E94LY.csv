6251313,4,B00I5E94LY,"I enjoyed this film. It is a entertaining look at dating. The lead character dates four women and then decides which one to settle down with. All of the women have their own issues. If the women would not have had sex until they were married they would've avoided the drama. Keith Robinson is as charming as ever. The film doesn't address the harm that being used and discarded has on women who have casual sex. A little more time should've been spent dealing with the women's reaction to being played. The film mainly focuses on Keith's character feelings and how he matures over time. Mr. Keyes is funny as Keith's best friend and the lovely Jazsmine Lewis is as gorgeous as ever. One thing bothered me. Mrs. Lewis didn't need the fake eyelashes and Mrs. Givens didn't need the eyeliner and excessive eye shadow. These women are naturally beautiful. Too much makeup makes a woman unattractive. Mr. Nolen is very talented and this is the best movie that I've seen him direct. Recommended for fans of romantic comedies. This would be rated PG-13 for a mild sex scene. No profanity, drug use, nudity or violence.",1403740800,6,1111,4.673469387755102
6251314,4,B00I5E94LY,"Good cast, funny moments... Appreciate the eye candy.  Love Christian Keyes, this was one of Laila Odom's best roles... This movie was very entertaining, shows the differences between the male/female thought process... I watched it one night bored and ended up recommending it to several friends all whom liked it as well.",1402185600,,322,5.1923076923076925

6251316,2,B00I5E94LY,"Not the best movie at all. So, you can determine if you want to spend your hard earned money on a script that was not well developed. It's so, unfortunate because it had some notable veteran and upstart actors.",1397779200,4,210,4.410256410256411
6251317,5,B00I5E94LY,"Story line was good, I love Christian Keyes, and the season lover was hilarous but hou learned a lot if you are a skirt chaser..

A Lot of bed action I had to turna way from until it was over, but still good to see.",1397433600,,215,3.7777777777777777
6251318,5,B00I5E94LY,"When it comes to finding ones true love, Four Seasons definitely hits home. Xavier Lamar, a successful computer analyst is seeking a soul mate and believes dating a different woman during each season is the best way to go.  His best friend, Derrick, who owns a caf, is there for moral support when Xavier begins his pursuit to find Ms. Right. But soon he will discover that finding the right woman is not as easy as one may think. Some of the scenes are hilarious. The actors did an exemplary job and the vivid scenery is amazing. Christopher Nolen did an excellent job delving into the ups and downs when it comes to dating, love, and romance, and the key elements required to form a genuine and lasting relationship. A must see movie for anyone seeking that special someone.",1396742400,7,776,4.58273381294964

6251321,5,B00I5E94LY,This movie had me laughing and the cast was great. Most important Christopher Nolen always has a message in his movies and I love the powerful message in the movie. Keith Robinson was awesome and Christian Keyes with his insightful relationship advice was on point and hilarious.  I love the fact that the characters were relatable and realistic.  Great movie.,1432512000,2,360,4.983333333333333

6251325,2,B00I5E94LY,"It wasn't bad... and it wasn't good.

Xavier is ready to settle down, but he wants to be sure before committing to a relationship. He comes up with a plan to date four women (one for each season) - then at the end of the year he will make his choice. I'm a big Robin Givens fan - so that was the deciding factor if I was going to watch it or not.

Robin had a few scenes, but that wasn't enough to save this film. The script left too many holes throughout the story. This is a movie you watch when you can't find the remote control - and too lazy to look for it.

***Positive Note... There was a scene that broke down the important factors needed to find that ""perfect"" one.***",1424563200,,677,4.037313432835821

6251327,4,B00I5E94LY,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am used to the usual gotta find a man theme that most of b-movies take to keep the interest of the audiences it attracts, but this was a refreshing take on how a man deals with finding a mate. I thought it added a bit of interesting twist to make you wonder if his idea would work, and how it would pan out in the end.",1422403200,2,349,3.861111111111111

6251329,4,B00I5E94LY,"A little disjointed at times. Overall, its a good movie to watch during the holidays or for 3 day weekend. If your a Christian Keyes fan, this is one more movie to add to his collection. Keith Robinson is great actor as well.",1419638400,,225,4.255813953488372
