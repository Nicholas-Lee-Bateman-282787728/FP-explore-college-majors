8645822,5,B00IWS74TM,"I've really enjoyed watching these films.  Raymond Burr continues with his exceptional portrayal of Mason (whose special presence and grace cannot be equaled.)  And who can deny the warmth and charm of the lovely, dedicated Della (Barbara Hale.)  These two are beautiful together.  What struck me as equally impressive was the quality of each production and the wonderful supporting characters.  William Katt (Hale's real life son and Robert Redford doppelganger) is terrific as Paul Drake Jr.  Katt's handling of the character, with equal parts smirk and mirth, make him irresistible.  (I was sad to see him leave after the 9th film.)  Lastly, one can't leave without mentioning the wonderfully irrepressible attorney/investigator Ken (played by William Moses.)
The Perry Mason TV series and film series has been a great source of joy for me.",1468281600,,843,5.285714285714286
