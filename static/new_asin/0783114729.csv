42057,5,0783114729,"...First , i have to admitt that i've never ever heared about this movie bofore one night i was just watching the T.v and there it was..and i guess i was lucky...i didn't feel like watching a movie i felt like beeing a witness of that man's life...as if i was a member of his family or even as if i was him....Daniel day lewis' great performance makes you feel all the non-spoken feelings...personally, daniel day lewis became my favourite actor since i've seen that beautifull movie....the movie is about life so it's full of joy as it's full of sadness, you'll smile as you'll tear. very senstive and heart catching....the movie is divided ito chapters..which are the chapters of the autobiography of the writer ..in each a portrait by painting and by words for every one who did impact the writer...the tender mother, the furious father who held unshowed tenderness and more..........if you are browsing to buy it...do it with out thinking.. :))",1063238400,3,948,4.786585365853658
42058,5,0783114729,"Admittedly, when I first saw this movie many years ago, I thought that the director had hired an actor with cerebral palsy to play Christy Brown!  That's how good Daniel Day-Lewis is in this film.  Taking absolutely nothing from the rest of the movie's cast, but I became a fan of this great actor almost from the opening scene.  (I read somewhere that during filming, Day-Lewis spent the entire three-month shoot confined to his weelchair - even off camera!  Talk about focus, concentration and dedication.)
To say that this film did justice to the life and times of Christy Brown would be an understatement.",1061942400,,609,4.826923076923077
42059,5,0783114729,"Starring Daniel Day Lewis and Brenda Fricker, this 1989 Academy Award winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress is a story that will warm your heart and allow you a glimpse at personal courage on a level beyond belief.
Christy Brown played by Lewis, was born with Cerebral Palsy in an era when such children were put away in institutions. His mother and father, unable to imagine sending one of their own away, encouraged and supported their son till he was able to become a self sufficient person with a life of his own. Author of the famous telling of his life story, he was also an artist of considerable talent.
Lewis does a superb job and was most deserving of the Oscar he won for the part. The story will reach even the corners of your heart.  Kelsana 7/23/02",1027382400,14,774,4.48936170212766
42060,5,0783114729,This is a movie that really pulls at the heartstrings.  I've seen the movie many times and it gets me every time I watch it.  Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job portraying Christy Brown-have read the book years ago.,1012003200,,213,4.435897435897436
42061,4,0783114729,"The only picture I can stand Daniel Day-Lewis in. He portrays Irish artist Christy Brown here, and he won the best actor Oscar for this performance, which was stunning. The role was highly taxing and challenging, I would imagine, and I have to say that Day-Lewis has not come even close to reprising the genius he harnessed here. He probably never will. Sometimes the picture is painful to watch, and if you make the time-it is worth it-to watch it yourself, you will see why.",985564800,6,476,4.6117647058823525
42062,4,0783114729,"At first I felt quite apprehensive about this film, because based on its subject matter I was afraid that it would be a typically saccharine ""triumph of the human spirit"" movie.  I'm glad that I brushed my fears aside and saw it, because this is a movie that manages to be heartwarming without being sentimental.  Of course, Day-Lewis's acting is incredible, and just to say that it's believable in a role such as this one is high praise.  But then, I disliked Shine, so you should take my opinion with a grain of salt.",976060800,2,519,4.5

42064,3,0783114729,"This is a great film that deserves better.  It's a shame when you can get a VHS copy that is better than the DVD.  I cannot recommend the DVD much at all unless you find it very cheap.
The movie on the other hand is very  good.  Like In The Name of the Father & The Boxer which came later, My  Left Foot has great characters with wonderful actors.  I initially thought  it was going to be a light comedy.  Boy was I wrong.  Definitely worth  renting and then wait for a company to release a good DVD.",962409600,6,500,4.010204081632653
42065,4,0783114729,"This is an amazingly good movie, and film performances don't get any more compelling than those delivered here by Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker.  Day-Lewis's portrayal of Christy Brown and his handicap is so  convincing that it is difficult to believe that Day-Lewis is not actually  stricken with Cerebral Palsy.  But his portrayal, like the Irish writer and  artist he portrays, gets far beyond the physical challenges of the disease.  He conveys a warmth, humor, and human intensity that avoids cloying  sentimentality. In terms of the movie content, I can only echo the  superlatives of the previous reviewers.  The film itself deserves 5+  stars.
Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is not what I had hoped for. The  picture is not noticeably better than on VHS.  It is not particularly clear  or vivid, and the red hues bleed a bit (like on an aging VHS tape). Perhaps  most distracting, there are specks of dirt visible on the image  (particularly in light areas, like sky), and there are dust and lint  artifacts throughout the transfer. I don't know if all of these flaws were  part of the original, master copy, but it looks like they just made a quick  transfer from a film copy they had handy. It's a shame that such a fine  movie, which won 2 Academy Awards, did not merit more care in the transfer  to DVD.
In short, this a triumphant movie that merits seeing (and  owning). But if you have a VHS copy in working order, you won't get much  added value from buying the DVD.",961200000,77,1488,4.686046511627907
42066,5,0783114729,"Daniel Day-Lewis stars in the true tale of Christie Brown, born and raised in the slums of Dublin, crippled except for the use of his left foot. This is a story of great triumph over poverty, disability and ignorance.  Christie learns to write, paint and live with only his singular functioning  limb and exceptional mind to call upon. This movie will give you the same  inspirational and uplifting feeling you get when little animals get rescued  from wells or if you've just watched The Shawshank Redemption.... And being  an Irish film, set in Dublin, its also very, very funny in places making it  a complete cinematic experience. Director Jim Sheridan makes great films,  and this is his finest hour.",950227200,5,705,4.873949579831932

This is a sweet litttle movie and I was totally fallen in love with the charactor Christy Brown. I was absorbed into his charactor so deeply that I was him himself through out the movie and really enjoyed it.
The nurse whom he is going to be married him is really adorable and his mother too. Actually all of the charactor in this movie is really great and I don't even know how the director found those actors.

42150,5,0783114729,"There is something distinctly relatable about My Left Foot for me personally. I was born with cerebral palsy and have had to endure numerous people tell me that I couldn't do things and tell my mother that I wouldnt amount to anything. But much like Christy Brown, I had a very strong mother and a will that I wasn't just going to sit in the corner and drool on myself all day. While I am no world renowned writer and painter, I related very strongly to the main character in this film including his struggles with relationships with the opposite sex.

Beyond my personal story, Daniel Day Lewis delivered a spectacular performance because it is really difficult to play someone that physically disabled because you have to treat the real life person with respect, while making it look believable. I totally forgot that Daniel Day Lewis was an able-bodied actor during that one hour forty minutes. That proves he was well worth the 1989 Academy Award.

The supporting actors deserve praise as well. The many actors who played the family at various stages really brought to life the struggle that many families with disabled relatives go through of how to involve their relative while struggling with how society may look at them. I also thought it was an interesting cinematic choice to tell the story as part of a series of flashbacks as Christy prepares to speak at this event. It is a technique that is rarely used well.

My Left Foot is a cinematic triumph and a personal triumph illustrative of the true possibilities of the human spirit. I wish I could give it six stars.",1448150400,8,1577,4.6859205776173285

42287,5,0783114729,"WITH BLU-RAY AND FULL MOVIE REVIEW

INTRO: Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical book by the same name, the movie My Left Foot is one of those exceptional tales of the human spirit told in an exceptional way.  With very little melodrama, it allows us to be enlightened, amazed, and inspired while still seeing some of the subject's warts or imperfections.  It can make us question our own excuses for not overcoming personal obstacles.

THE STORY:  Legendary Irish author and painter Christy Brown was born with cerebral palsy to a poor working class family in Dublin 1932.  Despite recommendations from doctors to put him in a home, the large family insists on the challenge of caring for him themselves.  With all the physical debilitations of CP, the one limb that Christy can effectively control and manipulate is his left foot.  The movie depicts a somewhat hard bitten family that struggles for subsistence and sleeps in communal beds.  Christy is well loved and protected, but there is a certain acceptance that he cannot communicate or even understand his surroundings to some degree.  The family may display some of those harsh stereotypes (at least as the movie depicts), but when push comes to shove, don't mess with the family!  Despite preconceptions, Christy will show sparks of intelligence and understanding as he catches his family's attention, then shows inner brilliance with opportunities of education that present themselves.  One could say the economic reality itself would have been a great barrier to success, let alone the challenge of CP.  However, we see how Christy not only improves his situation with his disability, but turns that very condition into a path to success in a way.  Of course he has help and is pushed at times by those who loved him.  This is not a canonization of a perfect individual.  Just a story of triumph despite all one's flaws.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  It was heartening to see the community congeal around Christy and include him in the simplest activities such as a game of football.  Even hilarious as much as it was touching.  Seeing the family protect each other in a scrap with another party over a snide comment was a highlight of the whole movie!  I have to admit this is one of those stories I will remember and ask myself what the excuse is when I am feeling sorry for myself, or that I can't do something.  Every person has a hidden corner of exceptionality waiting inside of us.  This is an extraordinary tale of someone who found it against all odds.

REMASTERED BLU RAY EDITION:  The 2015 release of the 1989 movie has received a restoration for all new picture quality that is quite excellent overall.  The colors are very good.  The film has little grain and it appears they opted for a smooth look (rather than sharper, but with more grain).  I was very happy overall with the upgrade.  I didn't expect reference quality from an 80's movie.  Though the colors are very good, there is also a very slight washed look that I think was part of the color pallet.  Here are other specs on this disc: Blu Ray features 1080p video, a lossless 5.1 soundtrack, and supplements include: The Real Christy Brown and An Inspirational Journey: The Making of My Left Foot.  1:85:1 aspect ratio. Subtitles/Captions English SDH, Spanish

ACCOLADES:  Daniel Day-Lewis won the first of his three (time of writing this) Leading Actor awards for his performance.  Brenda Fricker also won best Supporting Actress.  The film received a total of 5 Academy Award nominations including best picture and best director.  It also won many other awards outside the Oscars.",1421712000,7,3610,4.8686371100164205

42333,5,0783114729,"This movie tells the true story of a man born with cerebral palsy at a time when these conditions were not universally treated or understood.  As a child he would watch his ample family getting ready for the day, discussing their homework, and at night he slept in the same room with his siblings (as most working class families had kids do).  His wise and determined mother nurtured him.  Intellectually stimulated "" by happy accident""  his brilliant mind had to come forward.

42362,5,0783114729,"I don't know how I missed this when it originally came out in the late '80s, but I am delighted to have finally seen ""My Left Foot.""  Based on the early life of Irish painter, writer, and poet, Christy Brown, the movie takes a long, hard look at the hard life that was found in Dublin in the war and post-war eras.  Yet the film deftly sidesteps stereotypical treatment of the artist's family in deeply felt and skillfully acted performances by the supporting cast, notably those playing Brown's parents.

Neither the film nor its principal star, Daniel Day-Lewis, shy away from the harsh and physically disturbing realities of life with severe cerebral palsy.  I am again amazed at Day-Lewis's willingness as an actor to select roles that are dramatically challenging as well as unflattering in their physicality.  And that willingness to lay it all on the line doesn't stop with Day-Lewis; the young boy who plays the youthful Brown is, himself, worthy of praise for completely submerging himself in the role.

Humorous--indeed, occasional laugh-out-loud moments--without being corny, touching without undue sentimentality, this is a movie that will move you, and that you will ponder for weeks and months to come.",1413849600,,1216,5.055

As far as the acting goes, I'm not sure that my own words could justify its brilliance. Simply flawless. Even though I have come to expect nothing less than perfection from DDL I still found myself in awe of the performance. Even the young man who played Christy as a child was amazing.

As far as the story, it was simply heart-wrenching but not in the kind of disingenuous over-dramatized way we often see with movies that deal with heavy material. On the contrary, it was as organic and honest as one could imagine it being for the man whos had to live through these tribulations. The film does a great job of letting you see the world through the eyes of the sufferer. Yet it's melancholy was counterbalanced with a sense of inspiring strength and perseverance.

I wish I were articulate enough to explain just how and why this movie moved me so. The best I can do is simply say that this is one of the few movies I would ever give a 10/10.",1390262400,,1186,4.290178571428571

42467,3,0783114729,"This is a touching true story based upon the book of the same title, and I think every family would enjoy it (it carries an 'R' rating because there are a few 'f' words scattered about, but nothing too extreme...and sometimes it's difficult to understand the profanities anyway). Today, it might even be PG-13. Overall, the impact of Christy Brown's story is powerful and inspirational, and the film was obviously a labor of love for all involved. But my one caveat concerns the performance of Day-Lewis. I realize that the man put his heart into this (and won an Oscar for his trouble), and I am a fan, but his performance as Christy is too broadly stroked, it comes off more as a distorted parody of Christie rather than a genuine representation. To me, Day-Lewis did not pitch this performance accurately, and he is obviously over-playing it, trying too hard. In this case, I actually think a less-talented actor would have been better for the role. Which is a shame, because ""My Left Foot"" is a very good (and now collectible) movie, but it's hampered by this performance. I like good human stories like this, and it's a shame we don't have more gems like this one in the old movie cabinet.
As for the Miramax DVD, the extras are good, with a couple of brief documentaries included, and a few reviews from noteworthy critics, such as Pauline Kael who went ape over the film (these are presented as literary--not video--extras, which you can navigate through with your remote). The picture and sound are terrific, and the film is a must-see due to its story. Fortunately, Day-Lewis would come into his own in later years with performances in ""There Will be Blood"" and ""The Age of Innocence"", but here he has yet to find that perfect pitch. And the cover on the DVD is not the Daniel you will see in this movie!",1389225600,5,1813,4.61609907120743

This movie is absolutely wonderful. I'd put off watching it because I expected it be maudlin and manipulative, but it's not at all; it's earthy and defiant and fearless, just like Christy. Daniel Day-Lewis earned the Best Actor Oscar for his stunning performance which manages to convey his horrible frustration and longings without being overly-sentimental. He's really outstanding. Brenda Fricker won Best Supporting Actress; she's immediately likable and admirable. The entire cast is perfect and the story is truly inspiring.

The story in this film was very bittersweet; Christy Brown overcomes his disability, but not without going through the terrible feelings of failure and loneliness - of doubt and isolation. Some scenes are very heartwarming, while others are sad and infuriating. The only issues with the story are the limited time spent with these events - in turn, causing them to lose some effectiveness - and the constant time skips - which make the story feel a bit empty, despite going over the significant events in his life. These aren't story breaking problems, just a few minor issues. Daniel Day Lewis gives a stunning performance - it doesn't feel like I'm watching Daniel Day Lewis, it feels like the star of the film IS Christy Brown. The music in this film is great, and the movie moves at a very fast pace, especially if you're genuinely interested.

Overall, My Left Foot is an amazing film with a story worth experiencing. As of 3/31/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

My Left Foot has some violence.",1367020800,,1272,4.669642857142857

42682,4,0783114729,"Based on a true story, Daniel Day Lewis plays Christy Brown, an Irishman with cerebral palsy who was thought to be mentally retarded until he was 10 and managed to write the word ""mother"" on the floor in chalk using his left foot. It was the only part of him over which he had good control. Eventually he learned to draw and paint with his left foot, and finally to type on an electric typewriter. He then wrote his autobiography, titled the same as the movie, which was illustrated with his own paintings.

Much of the credit for his developing articulate (or reasonably so) speech should go to Dr. Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw), who was just starting up a therapy program for patients with CP. But when Christie agreed to go there, he discovered that all the other students were children, while he was an adult by that time. So Dr. Cole came to his house and worked with him, eventually getting him to practice the ""to be or not to be"" speech from Hamlet as diction exercise. She was also the one who introduced an art gallery owner to his paintings, which were very successful.

Unfortunately, Christie fell in love with her and was therefore pretty devastated when she told him she was marrying the art gallery owner. He drank way too much and got completely out of control at the restaurant where they were supposedly celebrating the success of the opening of his show at the gallery.

The story is told through flash-backs from his book. While the nurse assigned to stay with him while waiting to be presented at a fund-raiser for ""the crippled kids,"" as Christie put it, read his book, we see what she is reading.

Daniel Day Lewis was superb in the role. Like Leo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,"" we can simply see the character as if the actor actually had the handicap he portrayed. A tough acting job brilliantly done.",1336780800,3,1835,4.5683890577507595

The scene when he spells out ""Mother"" on the floor of his house, using a piece of chalk gripped between the toes of his left foot (his only usable limb) is beyond words.

This boys grows up to be a young man, nad he finally gets speech and therepy so he can communicate with others. His mother said she always understood him, but now others can too. His left foot and his brain are the only tools he has as he develops stunning paintings, and then finally writes a book about his upbringing.

It is a mother's love that gets many boys through difficult stretches.  That seems particularly true in Irish history.

I write with confidence: film classes, historians, and actors will be dissecting this movie 100 years from now. There are very few films for which this reviewer would make that claim.

42768,4,0783114729,"The true story of Christy Brown is one of remarkable strength and courage and one that is sure to warm your heart and lift your soul.  Biopic's tend to shoot for the heart as much as possible; who wants to watch a movie about someone they can't sympathize with; but `My Left Foot' doesn't have to twist facts or reimagine elements of Brown's life in order to earn our affection.

`My Left Foot' tells us of Brown's life from the very beginning, starting with his birth, moving through his childhood, adolescence and then eventually adulthood.  Born with cerebral palsy, Christy Brown lived most of his young life regarded as a dunce, a burden on his parents and a laughing stock to the community.  Aside from his devoted mother, who never gave up faith in him, Christy really had no one in his corner.  That is until he discovered that with his left foot he could write, and eventually paint.  This is the remarkable true story of a man who had everything against him yet was able to become more than many people with everything going for them ever become.  This is the story of the painter, the poet, the author; the man Christy Brown.

Lacking the glossy Hollywood veneer of many American-Made biopic films today, `My Left Foot' can at times come off like a made-for-television movie.  I think that is just the way a lot of these `British/Irish' movies are shot (except for the marvelous `Once' which is beautifully polished for an independent film) but it appears a little cheap sometimes, grainy and gritty.  It's a small and maybe fickle complaint, but a complaint nonetheless.

What never comes across as `TV' quality though, are the powerful performances by the entire cast.  Daniel Day-Lewis has obviously taken the brunt of the praise heaped upon this film, and rightfully so.  His portrayal of Christy is marvelously controlled and delivered with such masterful knowledge and understanding.  He never seems to be acting.  The real star to me though was Brenda Fricker who was so genuine and mesmerizing as Christie's loyally devoted mother.  Without a gimmick to fall back on, Fricker had to work double hard to captivate us while acting alongside Day-Lewis, and she succeeds with flying colors.

The rest of the cast does a great job as well.  Ray McAnally is believable as Christy's father, and Fiona Shaw shows considerable warmth as Dr. Eileen Cole, Christy's first real love.  Hugh O'Conor is marvelous as the young Christy, perfectly matching Day-Lewis' mastery of the disease raking through his body.  Lastly I want to mention Ruth McCabe's gentle performance as Mary, the woman who eventually gives her heart to Christy.  She only appears in small scenes spaced throughout the film but she adds such warmth to the film.

`My Left Foot' is a beautiful story of love and life and power in all of us to survive.  Christy Brown's life is one to marvel over; his struggles, pains and eventual triumphs all come together to create a wonderful miracle that is so rewarding to witness.",1205798400,7,2995,4.806640625
42769,4,0783114729,"""My Left Foot,"" (1989), is a biographical drama on the life of Christy Brown, an Irish cerebral palsy sufferer who achieved international renown for his writing and painting, all done by his left foot, the only part of his anatomy that he could control.  It was based on his book, and directed by the Irish Jim Sheridan.  And, although it strongly resembles the television disease-of-the-week movies the networks used to make at that time, it soars far beyond them.  Among other accomplishments, it won two Academy Awards, took a further sixteen awards elsewhere, and had fourteen further nominations.

To begin with,most of the disease-of-the-week movies were set in generic Anytown, U.S.A. ""My Left Foot"" is set very specifically in mid-20th century Dublin, among its working poor.  The film renders its location with detailed accuracy-- the look, the sound, the clothes, the feel, the mores, the cars, the housing, the ""crac,"" or wit of its people.

The film also benefits from some remarkable acting.  Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal of the adult Christy, witty, arrogant, vulgar, and strongly into drink and women when he could get them.  It was probably the best role in Day Lewis's career, and he really inhabited it to a stunning degree.  Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar for playing his lioness-defending-her-cub mother.  Two other performances were outstanding, though they failed to impress Oscar voters:  Hugh O'Conor was memorable as the young Christy.  And Ray McAnally powerfully defined the typical hard-nosed Irish working class father of the time. (Unfortunately, he died soon after completion of filming.) The picture introduced the pretty and pleasant Ruth McCabe, featured fine actors Fiona Shaw and Cyril Cusack, and gave us the frequently-seen Adrian Dunbar in a small part.

The picture does wear its heart on its sleeve.  It strongly implies that Christy achieved what he did because his family loved and supported him, and included him in everything they did.  And that's not to say that maybe the film isn't right.",1192406400,6,2057,5.116766467065868

42772,4,0783114729,"My Left Foot is one of those films you hear about and always plan to see at some point, but never get around to. I'm glad I finally found the time, because it was worth it. Daniel Day-Lewis had been one of my favorite actors, but I've never seen the performance that won him an Oscar. And I can see why he got it now. I can also see why Brenda Fricker won Best Supporting Actress, although I still see her as the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2.

The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's clear to see why it got all these nominations. My Left Foot is an Irish film that tells a very Irish story, but at its heart it is a story of hope and encouragement for all of humanity.

Wathcing Christy Brown's struggles with cerebral palsy that make him unable to move any part of his body except for his left foot is moving and endearing at the same time. Despite his physical handicap, Christy goes on to become a writer, publishing 6 novels and a book of poetry, as well as a great artist.

The special features on this special edition are very interesting because they show footage of the real Christy Brown, as well as discuss Daniel Day-Lewis's transformation and dedication to the role. The producer also talks about their surprise at how much critical acclaim the film got considering they used Irish actors, film crew, director, and everything. It deserves all the acclaim it got, and almost 20 years later it's still just as enjoyable.",1176422400,4,1487,4.479704797047971
42803,5,0783114729,"Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real.

I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - the friends came over, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking the wine, talking, laughing - having a good time. The TV was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to. Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not clink, the forks did not move, the food was getting cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character.

Jim Sheridan's ""My Left Foot"" is an riveting, unsentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life.

I like every one of Day Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"".",1172534400,6,1543,4.171140939597316

42809,5,0783114729,"""My Left Foot"" is a well-detailed biography of author, writer & artist Christy Brown, born with athetoid cerebral palsy. Brown's life story is told in flashback form & is documented in detailed fashion; centering around Christy's struggle of dealing with the severity of his physical condition while, through the support of his loving & caring family (which included some 22 siblings in all, with thirteen siblings surviving), making himself rather well-known as an outstanding writer, painter & poet. Christy Brown was never regarded as a man trapped inside a prison of a twisted, contorted body, but as a man who could show an entire universe just exactly what he became capable of doing - giving an abundance of love, hope & faith through the genius of his talents. From boyhood (when Christy first snatched a piece of chalk from his sister's hand using his only mobile foot) to manhood (when Christy turned the world on its collective ear by never saying never & refusing to give up in spite of his condition, letting his masterworks speak for themselves), Brown's life is a worthwhile journey, & everyone, disabled or not, can profit from his experiences. With so much to offer, it's not hard to see why ""My Left Foot""'s two main actors (Daniel Day-Lewis & Brenda Fricker) received Academy Award nominations for their outstanding work in one of the best movies of 1989. After seeing this film several times now, I often wonder why Hugh O'Conor's performance (as the young Christy) became overlooked, & didn't garner him any major hardware as a result. As a result of Day-Lewis' potrayal as the adult Christy, it was quite amusing that many people were convinced that the otherwise healthy actor himself had cerebral palsy. In fact, I believe it was through Day-Lewis' commitment & dedication to the role (even refusing to come out of character & eating lunch in a wheelchair) is a major reason why he earned that well-deserved Academy Award. Not at all far behind Day-Lewis & Fricker's performances, is the wonderfully touching portrayal by Ray McAnally (who died shortly after filming ended) as Christy's tough-as-nails father Paddy Brown. In conclusion, if everyone followed Christy Brown's example that he lived by in his forty-nine years spent on earth, the world would be a much better place in which to live. As for the features in this Special Edition DVD release, the reviews are a good read & the interviews are insightful. It would have been a real treat if Daniel Day-Lewis himself had been present in this Special Edition to give his account on Christy Brown's life story. Hugh O'Conor's interview sheds at least a little light on Christy's beginnings & gives this DVD edition more than enough credibility of making ""My Left Foot"" worthwhile & necessary for one's DVD movie collection. The video itself, although containing some noticeably visible dirt spots in places, is still a good transfer, & the audio quality is excellent. I can't say enough about this wonderfully brilliant piece of cinema (kudos to Jim Sheridan for his excellent directing & to Shane Connaughton & Sheridan for a well-written screenplay), so just pick up your very own copy of ""My Left Foot"" & see what all the fuss is about!",1140307200,,3218,4.939114391143911
42810,5,0783114729,"Biopic of Dubliner Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy and learned to paint and write using his left foot. The movie opens with Brown (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) being honored at a cerebral palsy dinner, and then reverts to flashbacks as his life story unfolds. The film traces his life from childhood - his large family (caring mother, doltish father), kid friends, girls.

He then meets a nurse (Fiona Shaw) who helps him greatly and with whom he falls in love. She marries another, however, and he hits the bottle. But at the dinner he meets Mary (Ruth McCabe) and they hit it off. The text of Brown's autobiography has been very well scripted - it contains just the right combination of sentimentality and realism. Never does the movie resort to self-pity, and Brown comes across as one determined, tough cookie. One of the bonus features is a biographical look at the real Christy Brown.

The whole story itself is one that you would think was made up to be a movie. I think that is something that makes this movie even better is that it is based on the actual life of Christy Brown, an Irish painter/writer who suffered from Celebral Palsy. For Christy to have gone through all he did, for example learning to write/paint with his left foot, and still be a success is an inspiring story that I'm sure will touch peoples lives.

I would definetely recommend this movie to people. The story, acting, and overall whole of this movie is one that should be remembered for years. No wonder it was up for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1989.",1130457600,2,877,4.407407407407407

42833,5,0783114729,"Christy Brown was born to a large Dublin family (he had 13 surviving siblings) in 1932. Born with severe athetoid cerebral palsy, Christy was unable to speak or control his limbs.  At that time, the only course of action was to institutionalize CP children, but Christy's loving family refused to do so, so he grew up as one of the gang: participating in alley football matches, being dragged around town in his wheelbarrow, and included in family dinners. For years, Christy was unable to speak or communicate, until he discovers that he can write with his left foot, the only limb that he can partially control. His mother (Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar for her performance) loves him with all her heart, but fears that he is retarded as well, until one day, pouring sweat and out of breath from his exertions, he writes ""Mother"" on the floor with a piece of chalk. His family is dumbfounded.

Christy progresses to painting with his left foot. As Christy enters adulthood, he meets Dr. Eileen, who wants him to participate at a new cerebral palsy clinic in Dublin. Christy goes once, but is shamed and uncomfortable around so many others like him, and demands to be taken home instead. Dr. Eileen starts making house visits to work with Christy on controlling muscle spasms, breath control, and how to speak more clearly. Christy quickly falls in love with Eileen, attempting to recite and memorize Shakespeare in order to win her love. His mother says darkly, ""There's too much hope in his voice. A broken body doesn't need a broken heart.""

Eileen and her fianc arrange an exhibition of Christy's paintings, and at a disastrous dinner afterwards, Christy gets stone drunk and makes a scene as Eileen relays her engagement to Peter. ""Congratulations on your wonderful news,"" Christy spits bitterly, sarcastically. ""I'm glad you taught me how to speak so I could say that, Eileen.""

After his heartbreak, Christy attempts multiple times to commit suicide, but the continuing love and support of his family keeps him above water, if barely. His parents build him a room of his own where he can paint and write in peace. Christy's father dies soon afterwards, and Christy publishes his autobiography in order to earn money for his family.

The movie's narrative structure is unique as well: the film begins with Christy getting ready to go to a benefit, and throughout the film we cut back to the present as he waits to go on, where a nurse reads his autobiography, and back to Christy's past.

Daniel Day-Lewis (adult Christy) and Hugh O'Connor (young Christy) are a seamless transition. It is obvious that both spent time in CP clinics observing the behavior, movements and mannerisms of CP patients; they portray Christy with sensitivity and an eye for how difficult the simplest things were for him.

This is an incredible movie. After seeing ""Rory O'Shea Was Here,"" another film about CP adults and caregivers (including Brenda Fricker), I wanted to see ""My Left Foot"" for myself after reading so many comparisons.  The Special Edition DVD features several trailers for other Miramax films and a making-of, featuring vintage footage of Christy's family and interviews with his mother. My only disappointment was the terrible transfer quality of the DVD; the film was grainy, with multiple specks of dust and dirt on every frame, and looked more like a worn-out VHS tape. Shame on Miramax for calling this remastered.

The film is rated R (profanity, domestic violence, suicide attempts and massive alcohol use).",1127433600,33,3520,4.9324324324324325
42834,5,0783114729,"The course of life will demand toughness and effort from an individual, as it occasionally hits low points.  How the individual deals with these low points will determine what character the individual possess, because any individual can easily sail through the highs.  Some ill-fated have to face harsher and more frequent slumps, which might even be darker and rougher than some could ever imagine.  Yet, they have to persist, and find joy in the small things in life.  The director Jim Sheridan has over the past decade and a half made a handful films about struggle and the essence of how to overcome hardships.  His breakthrough film, My Left Foot, illustrates the biographical struggle of Christy Brown (Daniel Day-Lewis) who suffered from the condition cerebral palsy since birth and the societal ignorance of his condition, which delivers a unique perspective on character and toughness.

Through a close-up in the opening the camera gradually pans over a typewriter while a left foot slowly reaches across the typewriter for a vinyl record.  The trembling foot grabs a record between the big toe and the adjacent toe that the foot lifts up towards a record player.  The vinyl record's label have been severely scuffed to the point where the label now is illegible.  After much effort the foot succeeds in placing the record on the turntable, and delicately placing the tonearm with the needle on top of the record.  Shortly after the sound of Mozart's opera Cos Fan Tutte begin to flow from the phonograph the audience can imagine the struggle of Christy Brown.  It is a powerful opening that gives an idea of the painstaking efforts that Christy had to experience on a daily basis in order to grow intellectually.

Christy's story is not unique in the sense of having Cerebral Palsy, but it becomes an exceptional tale when it begins to disclose how he got to the point where the film opens.  The opening with the foot that switches on the phonograph takes place at least three decades after his birth in 1932 when he acquired his severe condition through a problematic delivery.  When Christy turns on the record player he is preparing himself for a banquet.  However, when Christy arrives to the magnificent mansion of the banquet he is escorted into a secluded room with a nurse (Brenda Fricker) while one of the visitors sneeringly warns the nurse about the Christy.  In seclusion he can listen to the presenter through a speaker while the nurse begins to read the book My Left Foot, which brings the audience back the birth of Christy Brown.

As the nurse leafs through the book, flashbacks emerge that reveal who and how Christy arrived to the secluded room in the enormous mansion.  Occasionally, the flashbacks are interrupted by strangers that peek into the room, or by Christy's desire for something such as matches for a smoke.  Nonetheless, the audience learns that Christy's aptitude was discovered when he scribbled something on the floor with a piece of chalk.  There is also a strong presence of Christy's parents and his thirteen siblings in the film, which provided an opportunity for him to be independent.  It is a poignant story, which at time is heart wrenching, as it is very clear what Christy thinks, but the people around him are unable to communicate with him until he displays the ability.  Yet, Christy's cerebral palsy does not deter him from seeking a career to communicate with the world through the arts and literature.

Christy might have been close to incapable of creating movement with the exception of his left leg and foot.  Despite this setback he displays the power of the mind in more than one way, as he expresses himself articulately and intelligently while also pushing himself to apply his few physical skills to paint, write, and, yes, soccer.  Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the ability, or perhaps the lack of physical ability, of Christy Brown with a radiant and unforgettable performance.  To balance Day-Lewis' strong performance, as Christy, the audience can observe Brenda Fricker, as the nurse who cares for him in the secluded room, deliver a performance that creates compassion, tension, and affection.  Together with Sheridan's direction these two actors are cast with a large group of talented actors that support Day-Lewis in all parts of the film.  My Left Foot will leave the viewers with an empowering and breathtaking cinematic experience despite generating an unfair view of the world and the difficulties that might wait around the next corner.",1125187200,,4514,4.966755319148936

I mean, getting a girl is a great and even wondrous thing for any man, but this story has much bigger fish to fry, as it were, and the ending seems to toss all said fish out the window in favor of the most commonplace of happy endings. My partner told me she'd done some research and come away thinking the movie follows the book, and that that's how the book ends. But I'd like to have seen a more sophisticated treatment. That may be too much to ask of Hollywood though...

And if the movie does follow the book and ends where the book ends, then Mr. Brown couldn't have known at the time how his marriage to Mary Carr would go after he ""got"" her.
