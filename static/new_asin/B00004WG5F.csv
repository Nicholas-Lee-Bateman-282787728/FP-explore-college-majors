The other kids were okay but three of the four seemed too old for the parts, including Frizzy. Frizzy could have played the cook, she is short but not a little girl. She does make a lot of good faces, in fact she upstages with her ugliness, whether she is making a face or not. She kind of looks like Tiny Tim the weirdo. The adventures seem very dull at first. They rev up to about so-so. The book was not this way.",1464220800,,539,4.142857142857143
7925276,2,B00004WG5F,"If you are a fan of classic British literature and fine film, avoid this abysmal excuse for art.  As a young child, I enjoyed this this film with my family for only one reason, which is simply that it is truly mediocre to the core of its existance. To think that the world respected BBC is capable of such a s*** sandwich of a production should not be ignored, no, it should be immortalized. This is why I labor over this review which no one will likely read. To conclude: no one should waste their valuable time watching this drawn out and pompous reliquary of terrible English child acting. It's impact is unquestionably miniscule, yet the fact that it had elicited such emotion in me is deserving of a two star rating.

May God have mercy on their souls.",1445472000,,757,4.438848920863309
7925277,1,B00004WG5F,"True, I have no children, nor do I have an adequate ability to judge children's films.... All I can say that if you are a parent of a teenager son or daughter, do not buy this film on the assumption that they will automatically enjoy this film (like my parents unfortunately did)! Okay, I understand how children around the age of 8 might enjoy a movie like ""The Sand Fairy,"" but it will bring only shear terror to those individuals of a less-naive nature. Believe me, I know. And to this day, I am still haunted by the images of children flying through the air with Swan Wings. Even more traumatizing was the notion of a shriveled little gnome living under a sand patch and granting strangers wonderful wishes that always turned out to be the opposite of ""wonderful."" I am reminded of such films like ""Wishmaster"" in which a horrible genie would grant unsuspecting Americans wishes that were quite contrary to their actual wish. Okay, I excuse many of the films random aspects due to the fact that it was produced by an English film company, but for an American Teenager, like myself, this film can become the worst film experience ever. ""The Sand Fairy"" is nothing more than a five star film for children; a one star movie for teenagers.",1012608000,,1239,4.585585585585585
7925278,5,B00004WG5F,This is one of the finest childrens videos I have ever seen. My grandson  (age 8) just loved it. Unfortunately the library lost their copy and we  cant find it to buy. This story is about 5 kids who find a fairy and get to  make 1 wish per day which ends at sundown. Some of their choices were not  well thought out...The fairy...is an endearing muppet like character who I  fell in love with at first sight. It is a well acted English film.  A must  see for kids of all ages.,965174400,6,476,4.053763440860215
