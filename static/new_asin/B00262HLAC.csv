3850605,5,B00262HLAC,"Golly, why can't they offer this incredible series in Region 1 (US) format?!!??!!??!!

I have been watching reruns of this series for months now and make sure I TiVo even those I've seen a while ago, that's how much I love this series.  The filmmakers and commentators are sincere and highly involved with their particular cats although they know never to interfere no matter how tough it can get to stay out of what happens.

This is such great film-making that deserves better treatment than only a non-US format offering.",1262908800,18,524,4.8

3850609,5,B00262HLAC,"I watched Big Cat Diary instead of the news (I find the news depressing and repetitive) for years when it was on Animal Planet at 7am. But, unfortunately it is now on at 6am (just about an hour too early for me). Imagine my delight when I found it on Amazon Prime any time I want. This series documents the lives of 3 types of big cats (lions, cheetahs and leopards), in Kenya's Masai Mara Game Park in all their majestic glory and their life or death encounters. When you watch this series straight through you can become very attached to the cats they follow. I love the series and I am delighted that I can watch it any time I want with Amazon Prime",1466812800,6,652,4.224

3850613,5,B00262HLAC,This was a first class production that followed several types of cats and included interactions between them.  The only disconcerting part was between scenes when the Big Cat emblem would appear with a short musical blurb - I could really do without that.,1464652800,2,255,4.930232558139535
3850614,5,B00262HLAC,I am so grateful to all of the those individuals  who worked to create this experience for people like me. I have learned so much because of the generosity of these individuals.

3850615,5,B00262HLAC,"Excellent documentary. This series delves into the private lives of lions, leopards, and cheetahs. It is different from most documentaries in that it focuses on individual animals instead of the species as a whole.

3850626,5,B00262HLAC,"I need to jump on the Region 1 DVD bandwagon, but I am greedy.  I want all 9 seasons of ""Big Cat"" released on DVD (region 1).  Big Cat Diary (Season 1-4), Big Cat Week(Season 1-4) and Big Cat Live may have last aired fresh seasons back in 2009, but if any of the producers or copyright owners of this franchise are listening.... this may seem a long time ago, but the incredible hard work, stunning cinematography, beautiful music soundtrack and vivid compelling characters (both 4-legged and 2-legged) is too important to ignore and shelf in fragmented syndication.  Even after more than 6 years since it left the airwaves, there is still a vast audience (both new fans and loyal originals) that would jump at the chance to purchase a beautiful set of this wonderful inspiring series to watch in all its dramatic glory. Its popularity would be a cinch for profitable sales.  You could also possibly add a Anniversary bonus of maybe one of Jonathan Scott's picture books.

No was the answer.
I see the rating for the Big Cat series and of course it is going to be a high rating avg but that is due to the content of the video not seller.

There are many big cat documentaries but this is the king by far.  If anybody knows of another show like this I would appreciate the recommendation.
If you haven't watched this program yet do yourself a favor and watch it.  It is just an amazing work that will keep you tuned in like a housewife and her soaps...or my grandmother and her ""serials"".",1415059200,2,501,4.735632183908046

I was clicking through the channels one day trying to find something to entertain my dog so I could do some school work. As soon as he saw a lion it was over. Like a kid watching cartoons. He is now more ""cat"" oriented outside but otherwise this show works wonders for when I have to do something constructive with a crazy dog in the house.

3850647,5,B00262HLAC,"I don't get hooked on much TV, but this series has me totally mesmerized.  I've spent hours scouring the internet for past episodes, finding out the series was discontinued years ago, yet I just discovered it on some reruns on TV.

So Amazon has Series one for free, on Amazon Prime, and I've asked that they get all the series on DVD's, since after series one, you pay per episode, but only as far as Series two.  After that, you have to scout other resources to find more.  The spokespeople on the show are as much of the show as the cats, with their love and enthusiasm for them.  It is heartwarming to hear them talk, and heartwarming to view the love the mother cats have for their offspring, and all the lessons they teach them.

So you see, this series means so much to me, it is so awesome and wonderful, that I've been willing to spend the time to see where I can view as much of it as I can.

Good luck if you are as hooked as I am!",1404777600,2,942,4.114754098360656

3850652,5,B00262HLAC,Before I start anything i choose now to congradulate all who put their time and effort into this series. Second this is an amazing series. To begin the film crew put a lot of effort through all that rain heck that is persistance! They do an excellent job to keep out of the way of the cats themselves (or tried to at least :D) it is delightfully put together into a sequence that just keeps you watching. there was not one part in this whole series that I got bored and turned off my laptop. This just keeps getting better and better! I would recommend this series to anyone that is looking for an educational exciting series.,1400716800,,626,4.358974358974359
3850653,5,B00262HLAC,"I started watching this years ago. My Son and I would wake up at 7 every morning just to catch Big Cats on Animal Planet.

It is greatly narrated by the documenters, and it is so moving to look into the lives of these Cats and you feel for them.

I only wish they had done more of them, I would love to see the series come back, and hopefully on American Format DVDs.",1399507200,3,367,3.945945945945946
3850654,5,B00262HLAC,"I like the idea how the editors/producers chose different species of cats in the same area, to show how they all compete with each other for the same (or similar) foods/prey.  For the great lengths that went into obtaining this video footage, with names that fit certain cats (i.e., ""Half-Tail"") brought this in a bit closer and personal, in my humble opinion.  This was fun and educational, all packed into one.",1398470400,,412,4.788732394366197
3850655,5,B00262HLAC,"Very well written, filmed and produced. Great show on these majestic felines. Take the time to enjoy and learn about these wonderful creatures.",1397347200,,143,5.260869565217392

3850657,5,B00262HLAC,"This was well-produced and compelling.  For instance, I didn't realize a female was aggressive to the male after they mated.  In one circumstance, the small female clawed the male's nose.  A very sensitive and painful spot and you could see the big guy just stand there in pain, seemingly sad.  This film made you really see things as they were.  I wanted to tell that female I hope she doesn't get pregnant after that.  In lion territory, he gave her the best gift of all, and she was very willing, even playing a bit hard to get.  It is a curious thing and yet, maybe she had a sore back or some other neurological problem that she was willing to tolerate just to conceive.  All episodes were interesting to watch - to see how the other cats interact with eachother and their surroundings was equally-interesting to watch.",1391817600,,824,4.557823129251701
3850658,4,B00262HLAC,"Overall, it's a good series.  The producers follow several families of lions, leopards and cheetahs across the plains.  I was amazed at the photography and how close the producers could get.  Fantastic shots!",1390867200,,208,5.242424242424242
3850659,5,B00262HLAC,"I've watched this series which has 7 season over and over.  There is always something new to see, the diary of each family or animal makes this series extra special.

3850660,4,B00262HLAC,"I really enjoy big cat diary b/c I like lions and other big cats but if you are trying to find something in this day and time that isn't graphic or inappropriate for anyone who doesn't want to be verbally or visually assaulted, this would be fine.  They do show the cats killing and eating their prey but it isn't gory.  It's a matter of personal taste but I really enjoy it!!!",1389830400,2,377,4.222222222222222

3850666,5,B00262HLAC,"We were turned on to this show by a young lady staying with us for a few weeks awhile ago. British commentators go to Kenya, and spend some weeks with the big cats. You get to know the cats and their families, what they do, where they go. Wars between the cats and their enemies. Fascinating! They study leopards, lions, and cheetahs. Absolutely stunning photography and the two wildlife explorers or what, so easy to listen to.",1379721600,2,428,4.571428571428571

3850673,4,B00262HLAC,We watched the whole series and enjoyed it. It follows the lives of several different cat families and really gives a personal look at the at the lives of the big cats.

I am 10 years old. It is for adults and children that LOVE nature. Full action the whole episode. I get to see big cats more than an African person would see in their entire lifetime.

This is not right, I would gladly pay 50$$ for each season of course if the proceeds went to helping the CATS, especially to remove ALL the STUPID humans off of the reserve or at least out of the way so the CATS can have room to LIVE,PLAY,EAT!!!

3850694,5,B00262HLAC,"I cannot speak highly enough of about the wonderful Big Cat series (known in the U.S. as Big Cat Diary).  There is none of the alienating distance most nature shows present.  You get to know the cats, their cubs, and the hosts.  It makes all the difference.  I recommend this series to those who love nature shows and big cats, of course, but even more to those who are bored by the typical National Geographic stuff.",1357516800,,417,4.447368421052632

3850697,5,B00262HLAC,"I love this documentary about the ""big cats."" Very well done. You will experience the thrill of the wild from the comfort of your couch by engaging with the people and the animals, especially the lions who are the stars of the film. The male lions are magnificent. They add extraordinary beauty to the wild nature. The lionesses are also very beautiful on the magnificent African plains (where most people will never go). Understanding animal behavior, why they do what they do, and all the ramifications of their behavior in the wild opens the mind to new vistas of perception, with superior intellectual perspicuity, and broader horizons of appreciation for such magnificent creatures. This video series will help you go and experience nature in all its glory and wildness.",1338940800,2,775,5.015503875968992
3850698,5,B00262HLAC,"Informative and entertaining, Big Cat Diary can be watched by anyone. You really get a sense that the teams that made this series has a deep passion for wildlife. The focus is on the cats, but the team makes sure you know about everything that encompasses their ecosystem, including competition, prey items, and just other animals in general. The series becomes addicting as you genuinely want to see what happens to the different families.",1328400000,,440,4.95945945945946
3850699,5,B00262HLAC,"Big Cat Diary was precisely that a diary on the extended lives of lions, leopards, and cheetahs over a number of years. We get to know these cats and their mothers and grandmothers, giving us what most non-science types never get, an up close look at the lives and personalities of individual cats.  This series is worth its weight in gold.  Jonathan Scott and Simon King are extraordinary in the field and their knowledge of these individual cats gives us a the benefit of years of learning.  I strongly recommend this series as well as the websites of Jonathan and Simon. It is a shame that the series was cancelled and we in the United States were denied the final season, Big Cat Live.  Perhaps BBC and Discovery will team up and give us a series set in the Masai Mara again.",1318204800,9,779,4.464788732394366

It is reality TV with no script. The show doesn't show only the cute scenes to make you happy. There are real struggles, constant fights to survive, and love that will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I would give it 7 stars out of 5 if I could.",1315958400,7,424,4.246913580246914
