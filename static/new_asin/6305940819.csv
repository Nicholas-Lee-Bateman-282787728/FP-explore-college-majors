7897744,1,6305940819,I received the video II had ordered for my special needs niece.  Opened it to make sure it was ok before giving it to her and guess what--  no movie all SNOW on the screen.  I contacted Harmons Book store they told me to return it for a refund as they did not have any more videos. I returned it and got an email from them saying I damaged the video.  As UI told them I was the only one who handled it and I am 75 years old and did not damage the video.,1389139200,,453,3.736842105263158
