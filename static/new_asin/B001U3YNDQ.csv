8342741,5,B001U3YNDQ,This film is absurdly naive but worth watching simply because of Mike Dunn's amazing performance.  (Although I must admit if I have to watch him pushing that apple cart one more time I think I'm going to be sick.),1433721600,,213,4.461538461538462

8342744,2,B001U3YNDQ,"""The Man in the Mirror"" is a student-quality wish-fulfillment fantasy told with an unsettled mix of sincerity and farce.  Part morality play, part anti-hero myth, it celebrates the hippy-era ideal of dropping out of the Establishment and turning on to communal peace 'n' love, circa 1970, in New York City.

Michael Dunn stars as a disillusioned college professor turned earnest social reformer.  His vehicle, literally, is a pushcart, from which he peddles both apples and ethics to everyone from rowdy teen boys to old derelicts and a cop--conveniently without ever falling behind on his rent.  Dunn's interpretation of a simplistic script tends toward satire, as he tries to reconcile Apple Joe's naivet and street smarts.  Playing opposite Dunn is a youthful Martin Sheen, who slides easily into myriad disguises, gaits, and accents to sketch stock characters with comic effect.

The plot drags badly for the first half hour.  Cinematography is distractingly crude, disjoint, and full of heavy-handed symbolism.  Plot advancement initially depends on archival news footage of student demonstrations interspersed with recurrent close-ups of the Statue of Liberty.  The same pans of a particular street corner and the city skyline recur with tiresome frequency, and baffling use of apparent two-tone color filtration loses its impact on badly faded film.",1303084800,2,1356,5.44976076555024
8342745,5,B001U3YNDQ,"When you think you've seen them all... When this world has hit a low point... When you desire that pick-me-up film that is current and yet original in its message...you have stumbled upon it here and now. WHERE HAS MAN IN THE MIRROR BEEN ALL THESE YEARS? Thank God Frank Weston took his time getting this film on the shelves. Whatever handy work it took to sprinkle the finishing touches on this film--it needed to be done. Because like your grandmother's classic cookie recipe--this film was meant to be cherished, savored, and appreciated by generations.
All star performances by names and the like. Martin Sheen is a jack of all trades--and you know it even more by looking at this example of his earlier work. Johnny Brown makes your skin itch but warms your heart in the end. However, it is truly the work of Michael Dunn, a talent in his ideal role, who pulls at your heart strings only to put them back in perfect pitch.
May we all take something life changing away from this film. With all the new opportunities for growth on the horizon--maybe this film will help us find strength in ourselves to make a big step.",1240444800,2,1122,4.5594059405940595
8342746,5,B001U3YNDQ,"This wonderful, offbeat film is a must-see for anyone who wants to revisit the tumultuous New York City of the late 60s and early 70s. The heartbreaks, horrors, and hopes of that place and time will come tumbling back for viewers who remember - and the film will serve as a fascinating window into that past for viewers too young to have lived in it.

The late, great Michael Dunn anchors the film; his performance is heartbreakingly human and reminds us once again what a marvelous actor he was.

And then there's Martin Sheen! He pops up here, there, and everywhere, in roles almost too numerous to count. This has to be his least-known film, but it should be seen by every fan of his work. It's great fun to watch this already masterly young actor show off his considerable stuff. (He seems to be having a heckuva good time doing it, too.)

So: Grab a copy of Man in the Mirror! You won't regret it!",1239148800,3,902,4.421686746987952
8342747,5,B001U3YNDQ,"Man in the mirror is just one of those films that makes you go wow. It is untouched buy corporate hands and agenda. It is a piece of Art, like a rare painting of a time long gone. Yet the issues are now, in our face.
The movie is just plain fun, and challenges you to take a serious look at what we have lost, what we have gained, in the last 30+ years. This film owns hip 70's nostalgia, it eats your heart out and is the real deal. Great performances, Michael Dunn is all of us fighting back, against the odds no matter where or what we come from.
For many it will be the young and incredible Martin Sheen, acting in ways he has never done since, simply a treasure for fans of this star. They don't make them like this anymore, ( many try ) but thanks to Frank Weston ( Director )--- something, truly inspiring that was lost is now found. Highly recommended!!!",1236816000,2,862,4.136904761904762
