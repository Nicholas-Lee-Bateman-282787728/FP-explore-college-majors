I also bought his movies A MAN CALLED GOD,KINGDOM OF THE WIND AND JUMONG. No one can compare to the Korean actors but Song II Gook is my favorite.",1478390400,,276,3.9464285714285716
8495482,5,B0069SIJEG,"Crime Squad is essentialy a movie in 16 +, one r episodes.  The first episode and I was hooked.  I liked the characters, the fast pased action.  plot and plot twists and suspence - what will happen next.  And a lot does happen.
This is not a slick production.  It is very gritty and rough, and has a very real life feel to it.  It has an interresting diversity of characters and the acting is by western standards a bit over the top.  The production like many Korean cinema contains a great variety of emotions and comic relief.
The lead character Park Se Hyuk is a detective with the Seoul Gangnam Police Homicide Division.  He became a detective because he wants to avenge his daughters death.  He watched as his daughter was killed after a police officer, now his commanding officer, shot a perp who was driving at him.  Then the car drove through a store window killing the girl and another woman who was pregnant.",1355702400,4,918,4.475903614457831
