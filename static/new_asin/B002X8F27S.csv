8383528,4,B002X8F27S,"This is an interesting documentary of a group of young English drop-outs from diverse backrounds traveling to Argentinia to meet their mentor, Diego Maradonna.  They play free-style soccer on the street for tips to pay their way. Their first stop in America?  New York City, of course, and from there they travel down to Mexico and then Guatemala where they entertain crowds with their skills.  If they can earn the equivalent of $25 an hour doing free-style these boys have it made.  There are some nice leg shots of some pretty cool swings, loops, butterflies and other soccer moves.

Their only ambition is to be the next Diego Maradonna, an Argentinian footballer whose heyday was back in the late 1970s and early 1980s and who since then has fallen along the wayside from cocaine addiction. They want to meet the former star and play with him.  Young kids in slums in South America still talk about Maradonna as if he were still a top player, and talking about this former footballer is what brings strangers together, but is this the only attraction? I found this part rather interesting since England has some great footballers, too, but it's Maradonna these boys want to be like and eventually meet.

There are some nice behind-the-scenes clips of the personal lives of these boys and their down-and-out lives, as well as some revelations of people they meet along the way. I especially liked the story of the Saudi-English man, Sami, whose father he never met.

At times the narrative seems contrived and reality-TV-like.  Thirty minutes into this documentary there's serious discussion of the lack of funds to get all five boys on a flight to Buenos Aires.  Two must go home. An unassuming waiter pulls the lucky names out of a hat.  Then the documentary drags on for another 30 minutes about how unfair it is for two of the lads to have to return home, leaving their dreams unrealized.  The videographers somehow are always there recording it all.

Meeting Diego Maradonna is thus the impetus of this documentary.  We learn of little tidbits of the boys through dialogue and actions, but none seem to have greater ambitions with their lives than meeting a former footballer.

The end is rather anti-climactic.  Three of the five boys make it to Buenos Aires and meet the former soccer star as he's about to leave for Peru.  An emotional two-minute scene airs toward the end. There never is a soccer game with Diego, as he's on his way to his car.  That's all OK as the remaining lads' dreams have been materialized: they have met the man they left England for to meet.  The journey to meet Maradonna was more exciting than the goal itself.

I'm now curious to learn whatever happened to these five boys whose journey was documented here, or even of the two who remained in Mexico.  The end is left hanging.",1350086400,,2817,4.73155737704918
8383529,3,B002X8F27S,"Documentary following five English teens trekking across the pond and through the Americas in their pursuit of meeting their idol, Diego Maradona. What could be a film with boring subjects reveals true depth with regard to the fellows, as the voyage forces each to strip their tough veneer in an effort to make it to Argentina. There was much joy in their meeting Maradona. But something about the documentary bugged me, and still does. Too often, it seemed as if ""fate"" came through to push them forward, leading me to wonder if the documentary filmmakers or producers slightly made it possible for this to be. For example, when in Argentina, the gents happen to meet a gal their age that speaks Spanish and English fluently, and has connections to Maradona's circle. In another scene, one fellow needs $100 to purchase a plane ticket. After putting on a freestyle show, he counts his money and has . . . $100 and change. Little bits like that made me wonder how much meddling was involved by those responsible for the film, leading me to ask if a documentary filmmaker, discounting his or her presence possibly influencing some events, should assist a subject in any way. This off-screen meddling detracts from what should be a joyous film and calls into question those very joyful moments.",1295827200,,1292,4.824324324324325
