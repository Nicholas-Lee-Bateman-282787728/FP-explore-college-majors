3011617,2,B000Y2Q9MM,"This nice little mystery is well acted and features a youthful Daniel Craig displaying a charisma that had already outgrown productions like this.  There isn't much suspense here, as the viewer has a pretty fair idea from the get-go who the perp is and what classic narrative turns the story will take.  However, all hands do well and thoughtfully in their roles.  This hasn't got the memorable juice that made long series's out of ""Touching Evil"" or ""Wire in the Blood"" or ""Morse"", but it's a decent way to pass a quiet evening at home.",1214265600,16,537,4.631578947368421
3011618,2,B000Y2Q9MM,This was an okay thriller - but pretty predictable.  The acting was okay but not what you would expect from Daniel Craig.,1206489600,10,121,4.5

8230828,4,B000Y2Q9MM,"I had purchased this DVD for comparison purposes because my son was in a stage production of Kiss and Tell.  This is an good 'ol fashioned farce.  It is great to see Shirley Temple as she is making the transition from child star to adulthood.  She does a very good job of selling her character.  If you enjoy old movies and comedies then this is the movie for you.  One note though.  The quality of transfer from film to DVD is nothing to write home about.  It obviously was transferred from an older 16mm print that has its flaws.  However, a few minutes into the movie all that is forgotten as you get sucked into the drama and comedy.",1389225600,,637,4.294117647058823
8230829,5,B000Y2Q9MM,Super movie. An excellent mystery. Is the wife dead? Did the husband do it? Did he kill his first wife? Will he hard the woman he's dating? Is the detective (Daniel Craig) crazy for putting his ex-girlfriend in a dangerous position? Just when you think you've solved it a new twist happens.,1367798400,,290,4.596153846153846
8230830,2,B000Y2Q9MM,Made for British television -- and poorly made. The concept of the undercover officer is so absurd and so far removed from reality that you simply have to hold your nose to make it to the end. And the last line delivered by the inspector Kearney (Craig) character? Barf!,1319068800,,270,4.530612244897959
8230831,5,B000Y2Q9MM,"You are in for a real treat in the form of ""Kiss And Tell"". To be honest I was not expecting much from the description of the film. Boy was I wrong. Here is a tightly wound mystery that kept me on the edge of my couch trying desperately not to reach for the remote to fast-forward out of the more chilling scenes. The suspense was that compelling. Mr. Craig shines in the role of a cop who is still in love with his colleague played by Rosie Rowell. (Miss Rowell also gives a compelling tight performance here.) He and the entire cast just give so much spark and excitement to this cat and mouse tale of murder in suburban England. I really was engrossed by this film, a wonderful surprise and a great addition to anyone's library that might be a fan of great acting, good stories, or Mr. Craig.",1259020800,13,795,4.271523178807947
