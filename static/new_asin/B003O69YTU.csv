4161663,4,B003O69YTU,"As silly as it sounds, I found this ""superhero"" flick entertaining.

An unconventional and refreshing concept, more so since this type of film would almost never be made by the Hollywood number-crunchers. Seriously, can you imagine trying to pitch this to a studio?

There's this kid like Spiderman's Peter Parker - skinny, poor, unpopular. His greatest dream is to own a car, mostly to impress a girl in school. The problem is that he comes from an impoverished family and the girl is being wooed by his very wealthy friend. Despite this, his father works hard to give him his dream, albeit not quite as extravagantly executed as he had hoped.

His dream gift turns out to be an old relic, a crappy 1950's vehicle that's seen it's better days by more than few decades. However, unbeknownst to the kid, the old wreck has a hidden secret - it was fitted with a revolutionary power system designed during the height of the cold war. And said power system allows the car to *fly*. Sort of a non-leathal nuclear version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flubber/dp/B00009Y3RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flubber</a>.

He then uses the flying car to make extra money for his family by delivering flowers across Moscow (in broad daylight no less!), woo the beautiful girl, and believe it or not - fight the mafia.

Not the pitch that will be made into a major film, an inexpensive scifi tv series maybe, but not a film. No way.

But in Russia - way. :-)

Had a pretty good time with this. I'm not going to say that 'Black Lightning' will become the next installment of a Marvel or DC franchise, but it's definitely not time wasted. The story of Dima and his Russian-made Volga captures the heart of every child - the dream of flying and becoming a superhero.

Good clean fun and great for young kids. Well, as long as they can read subtitles or speak Russian. And maybe, given that this is clearly intended for the young, one of the few times I will ever suggest audio dubbing as a means to enjoy a film.",1306800000,2,2041,4.794871794871795
4161664,5,B003O69YTU,"It's completely derivative but it's good.  Good acting, good pace, excellent production values, excellent visuals, good story.  Just keep in mind that this movie is basically the Russian spiderman; nothing wrong with that but you'll notice the similarities early on (a lot of the first spiderman movie and a little from the second).  I could sit here mentioning the similarities but I won't, this movie stands well enough that you'll enjoy watching it despite the fact that it feels familiar.  It's unrated but it has a family movie vibe...not a lot of violence and I don't remember anything vulgar.  Rent first and buy if you like it.",1301788800,,635,4.897196261682243
4161665,4,B003O69YTU,not the best but not the worst it was kinda boring at first but then about 30 minutes in it gets good really cheesy but good BEWARE THE FILM IS NOT IN ENGLISH but it does have the option to change the language which is dubbed but not really all that noticeable the film kinda reminded me of Spiderman which is why i thought it was cheesy and somewhat predictable i would rent it from redbox first then if you like what you see buy it like i said its a good movie especially if your bored.,1301356800,,488,4.041237113402062
4161666,5,B003O69YTU,"Wonderful Russian superhero movie about a quiet Moscow college kid who inadvertently comes into possession of a flying car (1966 Volga).  Yes, there were tropes lifted whole cloth from other superhero tales, and yes, it was in russian (with english subtitles).  Know what?  Didn't care.  I had tons of fun watching this movie.  The acting was great, the effects amazing.  I watched it twice, and the plot held together very well - no glaring holes that I could see, and lots of cute/amusing little subplots to tickle your fancy.

But what really made this movie was the visuals.  Several images remain in my mind: the Volga leaping like an orca to save our hero's love interest from falling ice, showering her with rose petals in the process (it makes sense, really); the Volga rising like a phoenix from the bottom of the bleak and frozen Moscow River; the final face-off with the villain over a packed Red Square on New Year's Eve; the ""clash of the hood ornaments"" near the very end.  There was a lot of Russian iconography worked into this movie, symbolism that I lacked the cultural references to interpret but had a lot of fun speculating about.  The Volga, for instance - is that like a Ford Pinto in the Russian mind?  Or more like a VW Bug?

Very family-friendly movie (I'd call it PG), and a great way to introduce your kids to foreign language films without worrying about them being bored.",1299024000,7,1401,4.650406504065041
4161667,5,B003O69YTU,"Very surprised by the special effects in this movie - excellent

Similar tones to Superman 1 movie

There were only a couple continuity issues, basically dealing with his relationship with girl (again, like Spiderman)

Where can I buy a souped up Volga?

Very entertaining and of course the real Russian bad guy is a lot more believable in this movie than a host of American movies trying to portray a bad Russian person.

Almost all movies in US trash Russians or put them in bad light. A Hollywood mental issue in my opinion.",1298246400,2,527,4.623655913978495
4161668,4,B003O69YTU,"Let me preface the title of the review by saying; This IS a russian movie, and those of us who have seen Russian (and Soviet Union cinema in the past) know that it can be somewhat lacking in the enjoyment department.

However you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.  It is a really good example of a fun action movie.  I saw this movie dubbed in english and enjoyed it.  {This version is subtitled in english}.  The character development is good and the action scenes are really top-notch.

This movie comes from the same people who did the Night Watch Trilogy.  So, if you liked those movies, I think you will like this as well.",1297987200,10,635,4.422413793103448
4161669,4,B003O69YTU,"""Spiderman"" + a bit of ""Iron Man"" +a flying car = ""Black Lightning.""

That's the basic formula for ""Black Lightning,"" a Russian blockbuster about a boy with a flying car. It follows the same distinct pattern, but has an odd, enthusiastic charm of its own -- the lead actor gives it all he's got, and the whole idea of a superpowered car that can actually FLY just charms the inner child.

Teenage Dima (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is given a rather battered Volga for his birthday -- and he soon discovers that it can fly. As he digs up the car's past as part of a failed Soviet experiment, he also uses it to become the highest-paid delivery boy in all of Moscow. But his selfish behavior quickly alienates his crush Nastya (Ekaterina Vilkova), and even leads to the death of a family member.

Devastated, Dima decides to use the Volga to help those who can't help themselves. Soon the flying car known as ""Black Lightning"" is the talk of Russia, though Dima stays determinedly anonymous. But unknown to him, a billionaire is determined to get his hands on Black Lightning's power source, since he wants to activate a vast drill that could destroy the entire city...

I honestly shouldn't have liked ""Black Lightning"" as much as I did -- the plot is much the same as ""Spider-Man,"" with an ""Iron Man"" twist near the finale. But there's just something very charming about this movie -- maybe it's just the idea of a car that can fly, and the childlike enthusiasm that it seems to have for the idea.

And directors Dmitriy Kiselev and Aleksandr Voytinskiy seem to be having fun -- they mingle some exquisitely poetic moments (rose petals raining on Nastya) with high-octane aerial action and wild building-smashing kidnappings. This stuff is pure comic book fun, with no pretenses to be anything more. The flattest part of the movie is the villain's motivation -- he does have one, but it's kind of bland.

Dobrygin gives a pitch-perfect performance as Dima -- he runs the gamut from selfish/snotty to guilt-ridden/heroic, and he does a solid job depicting the uncertainty, pride and pitfalls of teenage life. Vilkova does a decent job with her limited ""love interest"" role, and there are a number of nice smaller performances for the elderly scientists, the mad businessman, and Dima's loving dad. But not Dima's sister. She creeps me out.

While it's redolent of American blockbusters, ""Black Lightning"" has an earnest charm of its own -- solid acting, solid action, and a flying car. Expect sequels.",1295913600,9,2491,4.792540792540793
4161670,4,B003O69YTU,"I hope this copy has much better translated subtitles than the others I have seen. I was outraged when this had been the only Russian movie I have ever seen with such a horrible translator. I have no idea why the subtitles in this movie are so bad, as if a small child translated it. I do not know if it is just because that specific translator just not speak very good English, or because they just did not put very much effort into the translations. I realize that the Russian language is kind of its own thing, not many of their words can really be translated very well into English, but come on people, paraphrase please. Regardless, this movie is wonderful, I love the idea of flying cars, especially classic ones. I would recommend this movie, but since most copies I have seen seem to have the same problem (not sure about this one here on amazon), I would recommend having more than a beginners grasp on the Russian language.

~(Before disregarding this copy, please note that the subtitles may have been unprofessionally translated, due to the fact that it was viewed on watch movies.net, only a few weeks or so after it had been released on DVD.)~",1287360000,,1157,4.535885167464115
4161671,5,B003O69YTU,"I really enjoyed this movie. The production values from Russia are getting unreal. Admiral, Day Watch, and now this movie. Sure, lots of the plot is recycled spiderman, but it is original in its own way, and the story and special effects were a lot of fun. It will be interesting to see how the USA remake turns out. This DVD in particular, with the white cover, is great. I bought a different version previously ON THIS SAME LISTING, and the video quality was horrible. Lots of sellers seem to be listing bootlegs under this listing, so make sure you get the white cover. The manufacturer is Ikano Filem.",1282780800,,605,4.559633027522936
4161672,5,B003O69YTU,"When Timur Bekmambetov (Director of WANTED) is the driving force behind a movie, you expect something entertaining. BLACK LIGHTNING delivers. Production values in Russia have gone way up, and besides Bekambetov, this film features some many of the brightest stars in Russian cinema including Viktor Verzhbitskiy (DAYWATCH and ADMIRAL). Sure some will say that this is just a Russian version of Spiderman. But that doesn't make it any less entertaining. The special effects were good, and the acting excellent. Just a FYI that Bekambetov will be directing the USA remake of this movie. This DVD itself is excellent with both the original Russian audio track, and an excellent English dub. Subtitle options are many and include English, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, and Chinese. The DVD is all-region NTSC format and will play on any standard USA player. Highly recommended.",1282608000,2,869,5.304347826086956

4161676,4,B003O69YTU,"3.5 Stars. This is a fun, if not too serious film. Set in Moscow, it is a Russian take on that favorite American movie genre - the teen romance thriller. Our protagonist is a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has his eye on a beautiful young university student - (and she is beautiful, makes you wonder why they can't find young girls this hot for the American versions) who finds himself embroiled in a dangerous mystery when he happens upon an old car that can fly by way of a super secret and now dangerous technology - that our antagonist will do anything - including murder - to get back. Think Russian Mafia meets Peter Parker and all with a PG-13 rating. Shot well, with an interesting back drop if you have never seen modern Moscow, and with a solid cast of proven actors who do a nice job.",1405036800,,812,4.279220779220779
4161677,5,B003O69YTU,"I'm glad the director's interview admits that this was made specifically to capture elements of American Superhero movies for the Russian audience. Because this film has a nice ""Peter Parker"" feel with a great rendering of the classic ""Uncle Ben Moment"" that transforms the iconic American-Marvel hero but situates it in a new narrative with familiar American nods.

I didn't expect much initially from the flying super car, which I loved in KnightRider and Gerry Anderson's SuperCar, but feel is a bit cheeky to work in most films. Surprisingly, the car looked good and plausible.",1398988800,,581,5.11578947368421
4161678,5,B003O69YTU,"Great story, great acting, great screenplay, great director, great action. It reminds me of a classic American make.

4161680,4,B003O69YTU,"The Russians have a long history in film but I can't say I've ever known them to go for the 'state of the art' populist, mega-movie that Hollywood is so famous for. That seems to have changed recently with the release of such movies as ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch."" ""Black Lightning,"" though not quite as spectacular, continues in that vein.

Here's the scoop. Dima, a student, receives an old car as gift from his father. He's not thrilled but finds out the car can fly (among other things). Some turns of events prompt him to use the car to fight evil-doers and maybe win the heart of a fellow student. It turns out the car was an experiment using a great new power source and some bad guys want it back to power drill for diamonds under Moscow, a move that will collapse the city. Can Dima and Black Lightning save the day?

This does borrow from better known, comic based films but it has a lot of clever turns of its own in the plot. But as clever as some of these turns might be there are also some plot points that one could easily consider naive. But you do come to like Dima. Here's a guy who is somewhat self absorbed and not very willing to help others. When this selfish trait comes back to bite him in the butt it's nice to see his transformation. He now feels compelled to help others. It's also nice that the flying car allows him to make more flower deliveries and thus earn more money to woo his honey. The effects are as good as they need to be. I'm glad they stayed away from being too spectacular. As much as I liked ""Man of Steel"" and ""Iron Man 3"" these just went on too long with too much. I grew tired and numb by the end. This was much more enjoyable to that end. The performances were decent and fit the tone of the film well. There was one odd side to the story involving three scientists (two men and a woman) who were in on the original project, and there relationship with one another, that seemed odd and unresolved. But, other than that, this pretty tightly written.

This is an overall solid and fun effort. For fans of the genre this should go to the top of your list.",1374710400,,2102,4.236907730673317
4161681,5,B003O69YTU,"Great Russian movie about a boy and his car. Makes me wonder what if Petter Parker found an awesome car versus a spider bite. This movie is that story!! Action, comedy, good plot etc.. Get this movie!!",1368576000,,201,4.45945945945946
4161682,5,B003O69YTU,"I'm surprised I did not hear about this movie, nor see any mention of it anywhere else.
Being a foreign film the effects are spectacular as well. Naturally, not everything is feasible with the physics in the movie.
However, most Hollywood movies do not have feasible physics either (cars blowing up from just shooting them, gasoline exploding, breathing in space, etc).

The plot of this movie is captivating. The main character is faced with many choices, and makes some bad ones, but redeems himself along the way. The female love interest is quite likeable too, she's not a popular girl, just the girl from somewhere else. There was no huge face-off with twenty minutes of fighting. The suspense in itself was created from the characters,
trying to find out ""Who is Black Lightning? What drives him?"" etc.

On another note, I love Russia and I think I'm going to brush up so more on my Russian now.",1363564800,,901,4.732484076433121

I already own ""Abraham Lincoln,Vampire Hunter"",""Nightwatch"" and ""Wanted"" on Blu Ray and took a chance. It's great!. The special effects are terrific and the acting is also very good. Even though it""s somewhat derivative, I personally liked it better than ""Spiderman 2"" and all the other movies of it's type, with the possible exception of ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"". And the DVD looked almost as good as most HD dvds. The premise of a flying car sounds silly, but they make it more plausible and real than I expected. Buy this.

The film is well made with very good special effects, but the story became too comic book-ish for me.  If they had stayed with the James Bond story (ala Mission Impossible or Bourne Legacy)) then it would have been a much stronger film.  Definitely not a bad movie, but the flying car made it a little too campy to be taken seriously.  It worked in Back to the Future, but not Black Lightning.

They both are interested in an attractive young woman in class (Mary Jane) who initially goes out with the friend but falls in love with our young hero. Evil very wealthy man who becomes villian (Norman Osborn)kidnaps love interest that our young hero saves. The young hero becomes a crime fighter with his new flying car, instead of just making money, when his kind and wise father is killed by a criminal in a way our hero could have prevented (Uncle Ben Parker). Some scenes are lifted straight from Spiderman such as the news interviewing people on the street to ask their opinion of Black Lighting. I could go on and on and on.

8401440,5,B003O69YTU,"This is a fun Russian language (with English subtitles) family aimed action movie with a financially poor university student who is given a car for his birthday, but all his family can afford is an embarrassing old cold war era thing, that his father bought off someone who stole it from a mine when they were working underground and came across it. Unbeknownst to the father or his son, this car is powered by a top secret power source invention, and the car has hidden wings and other features that enable it to fly.  Of course the film has a billionaire bad guy, who for some reason bothers to take the time to teach at, you guessed it our poor student's university.  He has been looking for this car for decades to power a drill to get deep under Moscow so he can mine diamonds.  He couldn't care less that this will destroy the rock foundations Moscow sits on and likely kill everyone living there. So when he finds out that one of his employees stole the car and sold it, he starts a Moscow wide search for the vehicle.  The vehicle is being used by our embarrassed by it, poor student to deliver flowers to earn enough cash to buy a BMW so he has a shot with the class' hot girl.  His friend the school rich kid, also wants to bed the girl.

I'm not really into superhero films but Black Lightning wasn't a bad one.  It's more the car that is the superhero anyway.  I originally thought it was somewhat alive with the first time it flies it seemingly does so to avoid an accident with those out to kill the driver.  So I thought this car is going to be like Herbie, Christine or something, but it's just operated by the driver.  Which kind of makes that former scene not make a lot of sense but you can live with it.  I quite liked the cast, the poor student Dima is a very likable character who does have faults, which show at first, but he learns from them and becomes a better person.  Nastya (how cool is that name, could have been the name of a cheesy villain, but it's not) is the hot girl, and unlike a lot of Hollywood movies, this hot girl is strikingly beautiful.  If Ekaterina Vilkova ever made an American, British or well English spoken language movie, I think she'd quickly become an A list actress. The villain is also well written, he's not over the top like American superhero villains movies, or missing IQ points like Australian and other country bad guys in kids films are.

Black Lightning is simply a fun movie, enjoyable not just by kids but adults as well. This is the type of film that Americans will try and remake and just stuff up.  If you don't mind reading a good movie (and there's a lot of action and not a lot of speaking anyway), you won't go wrong with Black Lightning!",1487548800,,2711,4.330039525691699
