5273163,4,B0096AYJPM,"I don't care how old you get. Deep down you still want to believe, for your children, your grandchildren and yourself. As a child i grew up with the 1947 movie and like the most. But I have to admit i really enjoy the 1994 as well.",1391990400,,231,3.9361702127659575

5273165,1,B0096AYJPM,I order this two movies set because the old b/w 1945 version said it was widescreen. It wasn't when I read the box on the out side it was fit to screen. Was misleading in the amazon description.,1389312000,,194,4.131578947368421

5273200,5,B0096AYJPM,One of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I love the two versions.  Both have their own charm and tell the story a little differently from the 1947 version vs. 1990-something version.  Love them both.  Part of my family's Christmas viewing traditions.,1486339200,,256,5.023809523809524
5273201,5,B0096AYJPM,"A wonderful holiday treat! I'm such a fan of this film that I also have two other versions of this iconic Natalie Wood movie. However, the 1994 version was very popular and well-received, so it's nice to have them both available one one DVD. Both actresses playing ""Susan"" are adorable and winsome, yet my preference is still the original with Natalie Wood. However, Gen Xers and Millenials might prefer Mara Wilson, who was a real scene stealer in the 1994 version, especially with those bright green eyes of hers. The original 1947 film was rather daring in that Maureen O'Hara played a divorced single mother, something you didn't see too often in films back in 1940s. There was also a made-for-TV CBS version of ""Miracle"" that was made in 1973; it was an attempt to bring a 1970s contemporary look to the film. It's not as lush or polished as the 1947 or 1994 versions, but it's worth owning if you can find a copy. I have a one-hour version from 1955 that was broadcast under ""The 20th Century Fox Hour.""

So snuggle up with a bowl of popcorn with your loved ones and enjoy this double feature of ""Miracle on 34th Street."" It will become a holiday tradition!",1485388800,,1163,4.564593301435407

5273259,4,B0096AYJPM,The original was perfect as it was; and the quality of the video on this release is excellent.  The remake - not so much. They gutted the final punch in the trial with the Post Office scene in the original with some lame reference to the inscription on US currency.  And they dropped the political advisor's character which appeared in the original - a great comment on NY's political practice of electing judges still relevant to this day.,1420848000,,440,4.628205128205129

5273267,5,B0096AYJPM,"My husband and I invested in a few Christmas movies this season and I was surprised that some of them, even newer ones created in this century, arrived without caption/subtitle options.

However, this movie does have captions! On both versions, the old black and white 1947 version, and the new color 1994 version.

I love both versions of this movie and I'm so glad to own them both, and in one set. I found that when we watched it, we opted first for the black and white classic and then later went back and saw the newer version. It was fun to compare the two. Wouldn't want to have to choose between the two, and now I don't have to.",1419206400,6,637,4.3

5273275,5,B0096AYJPM,"This Beautiful Christmas story is not only a classic, but our old-time favorite holiday movie. It's our holiday tradition to watch this for holiday spirit entertainment from Thanksgiving, through the new year. We watched it countless times through the years, and enjoy it as much as the First viewing, every time we watch it a year later.

We began with the Original Black & White feature, to the Color Feature, with a different cast of characters, and waited for the Double-Feature for quite a while. We have collected the Black & White version with Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood & Edmund Gwenn. Then, we purchased the movie in color with Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth Perkins, Dylan McDermott and Mara Wilson as Susan. Both based on the 1947 film classic, a wonderful family Christmas movie.

To add to our Holiday Movie collection is now the double-feature. An unforgettable, inspiring & entertaining Christmas movie for the entire family to enjoy. Highly recommended!",1416441600,4,972,5.1455696202531644
