8049931,5,B0007P0YKO,"I ordered this once, received the DVD with no DynaBand.  I wrote to Amazon and they said they'd ship a replacement at no charge.  Got the 2nd one, and it also had no DynaBand.  I called Amazon and they said they knew there was a problem.  I asked if they were going to pull the item from the site until the problem was fixed and they said they'd look into it.",1161216000,3,359,4.014084507042254
8049932,5,B0007P0YKO,"Great workout, very highly recommended to any intermediate-advanced exercisers. Production quality is excellent and the menu allows you to program any/all of the segments.

Although she does little biceps/triceps/shoulder/back work, this is predominately a butt, legs and ab toner - and boy does it tone! especially if you do both segments together.

You start with a 5 min warm-up then the first segment is a 20 min standing toning section using dumbells and the band (optional, you don't have to use either), then there is the 28 min pilates floor toning (again with or without the band).  The bonus 30 min step workout is a dancy one, but fun once you catch on.  I do it twice for a solid cardio session.

I think the references to Janet being arrogant are unfair, she is happy and smiling, cues well and encourages all the way but doesn't patronise and come over as cheesy or fake as so many others do.

You do need to buy a 6 foot resistance band if you want to progress and get faster results - although the band makes it tough, so I would do the workout without the band to begin with and when the workout no longer makes you sore, add the band.

I also love her dvd Brand New Butt and More - the exercises are different to the ones on New Butt Plus Pilates, so good to use in rotation.",1147132800,9,1293,4.407563025210084
8049933,2,B0007P0YKO,"this workout had potential, thus the 2 stars and not one, but the instructor has an arrogant edge and does not see to be interested in teaching as much as she is interested in being on camera...i don't know, this routine was ok, but the overall production did not make me comfortable; this a trade away dvd.",1130457600,4,307,4.4035087719298245
8049934,5,B0007P0YKO,"Very well done, liked it a lot.  Didn't think you could really target one area but Saffell nailed it!  I have had people tell me my rear looks good (that has never happened before this DVD).  Can't believe that a little work goes a long way.  Great DVD, the pilates portion was very good too.",1108857600,9,292,4.254545454545455
