7860354,5,6304027036,"The item arrived earlier than expected and in good condition. Never thought I would be buying a VHS tape in this day and age,but I have already transferred it to a disk. So no problem. Highly recommended.",1401926400,,204,4.54054054054054
7860355,5,6304027036,"The bonus @2 hour documentary contained within ""The Last Days of World War II"" is the little known documentary that is absolutely eye-opening to any World War II scholar or even casual history buff. The title is: ""The Last Secrets of the Axis"". It alone is worth twice the cost of the complete set.
  The research records the underlying story behind the organization, philosophy and world-view of the Nazis and how that shaped the thinking of Adolph Hitler. It is the story of Karl Ernst Haushofer, a man who Wikipedia describes as: ""a German general, geographer and geopolitician. Through his student Rudolf Hess, Haushofer's ideas may have influenced the development of Adolf Hitler's expansionist strategies, although Haushofer denied direct influence on the Nazi regime"". A bit understated, to say the least. The documentary ties together and answers most of heretofore unanswered questions of how a 'a failed, disgruntled loner - a crazed mad-man' came within inches of conquering the world. It is a story not widely publicized by the victors, and entirely unknown today in Germany. It is a must see documentary.

7860356,5,6304027036,"Many, many lesser quality PBS/NOVA productions are now available on DVD. WHY NOT THIS ONE?

VHS, if not totally obsolete, is outmoded and undesirable. Discerning, intelligent consumers will not spend their hard-earned dollars on this outdated, horse-and-buggy format.

Countless other PBS and NOVA programs that were previously only offered on VHS tape are now procurable on the (far superior) DVD format.

WHY NOT THIS ONE? ...And why not all your other fine shows still ONLY produced by PBS on VHS?

7860357,5,6304027036,"I purchased this film site unseen in order to give my Environmental Science students a feel for the problems solid waste is causing on our planet.  I certainly am able to do that using this film.  The pictures and commentary are excellent.  There is even a great section about the Mafia's tie to the garbage industry in New York City.  My students are all at once appaled and interested in the issue of where our garbage comes from and more importantly, where it is going both today and in the future.  2 Thumbs Up!!!",1178496000,2,517,4.457446808510638
7860358,5,6304027036,"This is one of the most amazing stories to ever come out of WWII - all kept completely secret for over 30 years. Anyone that is interested in computers, espionage, little know historical facts - will LOVE this story. It's a real life cloak and dagger mystery about the genius of a handful of men and women that literally help win the Second World War by the thinnest of circumstance. This should be mandatory viewing for all computer science and history majors.",1163030400,2,461,4.634146341463414
7860359,5,6304027036,"The program presents history of a most unusal alliance, the East and the West, both cultures superficially at odds and ultimately enemies together? Haushaufer shows that one man or woman can absolutely make a difference, for good or bad. All that is needed are believers, some willing to buy into the ideals as much as the Nazi's and Militaristic Japanese proponents did. Along with ""Saddam and the Third Reich,"" this program will lay the true foundation of current geopolitcs that are still affecting the world today.",1151884800,3,518,5.034883720930233
7860360,4,6304027036,"I was fortunate enough to take a dive trip to Truk Lagoon.  Upon my return, I wanted to learn a little more about the events that led to the magnificent wrecks I had just been on.  This video provided me with that.  It gave a narrative of the attack and events leading to it, and included some archival footage of the attack.  The more recent footage of dives on the wrecks brought back some great memories.  It was also interesting to hear the Chuukese people describe their perspecitve of that place in history.  My only complaint would be that it wasn't long enough, but I assume that is due to television limitations.  If you want a good overview on a critical turning point of World War II, plus some beautiful underwater footage, watch this video.",981590400,7,753,4.533333333333333
7860361,3,6304027036,My biggest problem was the insufficent ammount of actual underwater footage.  I expected some actual dive film on several of the key ships but got none.  I didn't buy this to listen to fat natives talk about the attack.,971395200,3,219,4.589743589743589
