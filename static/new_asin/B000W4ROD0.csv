8221233,5,B000W4ROD0,I actually purchased this video for our grandson and he absolutely loves it.  If you are a rail enthusiast or have one in your family I would highly recommend it.  I was fortunate enough to have ridden in the dome car on the City of Portland a few times back in the mid 1950's and this was neat for me too.,1347840000,,306,4.0
8221234,5,B000W4ROD0,"A nice video of dome cars in the Continental US and Canada.
It has great clips of classic Vista Domes and videos and stories of new dome cars. There are interviews with dome car owners, operators and riders including Arthur ""Amtrak"" Lloyd. It includes very nice photos of original dome cars and marketing advertisements, including the first dome car, the CB&Q Silver Dome. It has a section of classic dome cars still in operation. Video clips of both the inside and the outside of dome cars. There's also a history of the modern dome car design in Alaska Railroad (Alaska RR and Pacific Princess) and Canada as well as concepts of future dome cars.
A must-have for railroad dome car fans.",1253664000,3,688,4.694214876033058
