Redundant.  Horrible performances, script and direction.  You can tell from the opening you're in for a trash ride.  Not even a great ""B"" movie.  This movie as the vampires would say sux!!!",1093132800,,365,4.358208955223881
1821943,4,B00007M5J9,"Upon inspection of the jacket for this DVD, the reader gleans that this is a movie about vampire midgets. I like vampire movies, and I like midgets, so I figured, hey, two great tastes that taste great together, right? Little did I know that this was actually a movie about vampire midget REDNECKS, mullets and flannel and all. I laughed until I cried. And then I cried for real when I realized this movie was filmed not an hour away from here in SC. (I live in Georgia.) For some reason, I haven't been able to convince anyone else I know to watch this movie, but I swear it's entertaining.",1086825600,3,591,4.381818181818182

The fact that the storey takes off wae a bunch of midget vamps, makes this movie seem interesting.  This quickly deteriates into the midgets attempting to kill the only ""human sized"" vampire left by using a possessed sword with the blood of another large vampire(i couldna understand either,,sorry!!!!)to turn humans into vamps.  with the help from his midget sidekick the ""good guy"" attempts to rid the midgets and there pesky antics.  Dont ask how it ends; the poor filming, fighting being aided by those getting beaten. i only got 10 mins into it and returned it the next day.  Possible nitemares if watched, not of being scared of vamps, but the fact that this was actually put onto dvd.
Must be avoided at all costs the director, actor, publisher, writer, and all other positions(same person) desevres 10out of10 for effort to create the first ever one man movie but 0 for success!!!!!
Do not be silly enough to watch or buy, i was and won't live it down!!!",1081123200,,1530,4.4928057553956835
1821945,3,B00007M5J9,"This is an editied review. I'm leaving my origianl review up and I was harsh. But after later review I can't hate this movie, the director and all of his cast and crew seemed like they had a great time making it. Damn it I hate this movie but love the people involed in making it and thats what independent movies are all about. After the qoute marks is my original review.
""This movie isn't worth the time it takes to watch it, and I LIKE crappy movies like this. It's all a rip-off of Blade, with a couple of midgets. Unwatchable even with beer, I only give any stars because you have to applaud the fact that they actualy got the thing made.""
I Have come back to this review and added 2 stars, while it is not a great movie, I do have to applaude the filmmaker for his effort. It is mad hard to get 10 people to help you with your film let alone 50-ish? Not to mention a motorcycle club? Good on you sir.",1072828800,2,907,4.072625698324022
1821946,3,B00007M5J9,"I only rented this movie to laugh at how bad I knew it was going to be.  And yes, it was very bad, but I was laughing throughout the whole thing.  The movie was about a group of dwarf vampires who attack the ankles.  As they say in the movie, they're ""3 feet tall with 2 inch fangs and an undying thirst for blood."" Haha.  Only see this if you want to laugh at a corny, low-budget film and not for serious purposes.",1065484800,,415,3.963855421686747
1821947,4,B00007M5J9,"couldn't help but laugh through most of this film, very funny and entertaining flick.  movie is pretty much about a team of dwarf vampires wrecking havoc.  must see to believe.  as stupid as it sounds the movie has a pretty cool story and clever dialogue.  pretty darn good for a low budget film.  no suspense or anything but plenty of fun to be had here.",1051056000,,355,4.4
7978271,5,B00007M5J9,It's a low budget more about midget vampires,1513555200,,44,4.625

7978273,4,B00007M5J9,"Wow!  This one astonishingly stupid film.  Of course, I love it.  It has the crystallized douchieness of the early 2000's, late 90s, ""Nu-Metal"" era in there, along with the horrible acting and midget vampires.  This is a must see for fans of bad movies.  I really like that the lead actor and director's parents did the catering.  PBJ's?",1401753600,,337,4.724137931034483
7978274,5,B00007M5J9,"Look, there is nothing good about this film, horrible acting, confused ""supposed"" plot, photography some of the worst ever, sound track should have never been made. Absolutely no redeeming qualities what-so-ever.  Very painful to even attempt to see the film through.

With that said this movie is hypnotic in it's cruel attempt to entertain you.  It is so bad you will want to gouge out your eyes, and rip your eardrums to pieces.  It's like watching people falling out of a tall building and smashing into the ground and you cannot take your eyes off of it, your hearing becomes so acute that a werewolf would be jealouse.  You shouldn't see this film but your life won't be complete until you see this debacle.",1358985600,3,713,4.717741935483871
7978275,1,B00007M5J9,"Low budget homemade movie about vampire midgets who go around attacking people......IT'S AWFUL!!  There's minimal action, poor acting, crap for a plot, and the cinematography sucks.  I wish people would STOP making their own movies with camcorders!",1210377600,,248,5.675675675675675
7978276,1,B00007M5J9,"Its... like a [...]... its so badly done... you cant understand a word that is said because the sound is so bad, sometimes so quiet you just hear a faint murmmrmmummum sound.  Its like a really REALLY badly made [...], without the sex.

AND HOW ON EARTH DID IT GET AN 18 CERT?  It doesnt even have any special FX, barely even blood!  they must have stretched their budget to 5 blood capsules for the whole film.
IN FACT, HOW DID IT EVEN GET PUBLISHED!?!?!? ITS SO BAD, YOU CANT LAUGH.  ITS THAT BAD.",1104019200,,499,4.26595744680851
7978277,5,B00007M5J9,"My friends and I rented this a few weeks ago from our local convenience store. It's shot with a handycam, the actors are terrible, and the plot and direction are senseless... and this movie is still fantastic. From start to finish, we couldn't stop laughing. It's so terrible that it's hillarious. The opening scence with the vampire POV shots is second only to the amazing stunt. Yes, stunt. Some dude flips onto a fence for no reason, then backflips off it for no reason. Buy or rent this movie, it's the funniest piece of film ever.",1102464000,2,535,4.583333333333333
7978278,5,B00007M5J9,"I have to say I wasn't expecting much when I rented this movie, but after watching it, I was overwhelmed by what I experienced.  Never has a motion picture moved and inspired me more than Ankle Biters.  I can't begin to put into words the awe-inspiring acting, screenplay, cinematography, and special effects that is Ankle Biters.  For the entire length of the film, I sat on the edge on my seat in anticipation of what would happen next.  This unprecedented movie experience left me wondering how on earth this wasn't an Oscar nominee.  Even if the film was overlooked for a Best Picture nomination,  the acting of Adam Minarovich certainly should have been worthy of an Oscar.  This movie ranks right up there with Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, The Godfather, and The Lord of the Rings.  To see this movie is to be taken on an emotional rollercoaster unparallel to anything ever created in cinema.  This is quite possibly the greatest cinematic achievement the world will ever experience.",1098921600,13,992,4.822485207100592
7978279,2,B00007M5J9,"Vampire dwarves invade a small southern town.  They obtain possession of a sword that has traces of the blood of the last full sized vampire (dwarf vampires can only infect other dwarves.  You should have known that) and plot havoc and, presumably, world domination.  At least minions of full-sized vampire subjects.  Half-vampire, half-human Drexel, with dwarf sidekick T-Bone, combine to battle the evil dwarves.

 ANKLE BITERS is pretty dreadful.  Everything from acting to editing to the script is below average, is some cases way below.  If you're looking for a real vampire hunter movie check out BLADE or JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.  The dwarves are a nice twist, but the movie doesn't come near to having a clue about what to do with them.",1098576000,4,746,5.0

My favorite line!  Ha, if you enjoy mocking bad movies, this will give you plenty of material-- i won a 'Bad Movie Contest' with this one.",1097020800,3,202,4.4324324324324325
