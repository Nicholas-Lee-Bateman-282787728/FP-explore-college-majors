5647069,5,B00BLYCB1K,"If your interested in a few pages of Mexican history, along with stellar performances by the best of the best on the screen, Brando and Quinn, see this.  The photography is brilliant, as is the music score.  It's a solid hit from ""Dear Mom,"" to ""Thank you come again.""",1406419200,2,268,4.448979591836735

5647072,5,B00BLYCB1K,"One of my problems with early Brando, is his rather mannered approach to his characters.  Many see it as wonderful method acting but I see it as a bit hammy and somewhat over the top.  I think the newness of his approach, was somewhat beguiling to critics and audiences.  Someone said that when you complement actor on his acting, he really isn't acting.  The trick is to be totally free of the artifice of technique and to project that internal power that overwhelms.  In Waterfront, I always found Lee Cobb and Rod Steiger to be more convincing in the pure honesty of their emotion.  Zapata is different.  Here, Brando seems to resist the temptation to overwhelm us with his technique and gives a searing and honest portrayal of this lesser known Mexican Revolutionary.  It is a far cry from that rather cartoony Villa, of Wallace Beery in the 30s.  We see Zapata as a man, driven and always questioning his role.  His fury comes from deep within and explodes without the mannered style of his other films.  There is also a quiet, reflective quality to the character, which draws us to him.  It is in these quiet moments that the power of his emotion overwhelms us.  This is my favorite Brando performance from his early period.  Director Elia Kazan, avoided the usual Mexican clichs, which could have easily turned this into something approaching parody.  Anthony Quinn, has the far more histrionic role and won the Academy Award.  He never became a Leo Carrillo cartoon, but shows us an honest fury and frustration.  For the record, that is Fred Flintstone as Francisco Pancho Villa, yup Alan Reed, played both roles and was one of the truly versatile actors of his age.  He worked on screen, TV, radio and even cartoons.  He never seemed to get the appreciation that he deserved.  I send him a warm thought and a happy memory.  If you recognize Dr. No, it is Joseph Wiseman, who plays Brandos assistant, who betrays him to the other side.  Note the subtle sexual attraction that first draws him to Zapata and then the rejection which drives him to betrayal.  This is a wonderful and moving film and it is a shame that it is not better known.",1386806400,3,2146,4.63395225464191
5647073,4,B00BLYCB1K,"I choose this movie, because I saw it as a youngster with my dad.  We liked it and could never locate it again.  So, for me it had sentimental value to have Viva Zapata by Marlon Brando.",1382140800,,186,4.0

5647075,4,B00BLYCB1K,"This is a terrific film, made when Brando really wanted to be an actor and was working at it, rather than some of his later outings where he pretty much ""phoned it in.""  John Steinbeck wrote the screenplay (I think his only one?), Anthony Quinn won his first Best Suporting actor Oscar, and Joseph Wiseman, as usual, is excellent.",1372464000,14,330,4.593220338983051

5647084,4,B00BLYCB1K,Classic movie that you can see Marlon Brando in an early important role.  Gives you a great idea about Mexico revolution.  Zapata was a great leader for the poor who demand justice and fairness.,1435968000,,194,4.676470588235294

5647088,5,B00BLYCB1K,Great movie with a very young Marlon Brando playing the lead character.  Movie is about the Mexican Revolution around the early 1900's. Well cast and entertaining story that has at least some basis in fact.,1424131200,,206,4.885714285714286

Brando, as in most of his movies, is perfect, and the turbulent Mexican Politics of that era are engrossing.

5647093,5,B00BLYCB1K,"Another, oldie and goodie. Steinbeck's line, delivered by Marlon Brando, which says; ""We don't need a strong leader, we need a strong People!"" is apropos today.
Thoroughly enjoyed, even though the ending was predictable, but had a hint of Hope.",1416182400,2,244,5.125

5647096,4,B00BLYCB1K,"Excellent film directed by Elia Kazan and an amazing performance by Marlon Brando as the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. Although the film takes many historic liberties, it is nonetheless engaging and quite entertaining . Highly recommended!",1408492800,,248,5.916666666666667
8570659,2,B00BLYCB1K,I liked the Title but an warier version was better,1522454400,,50,4.1
8570660,3,B00BLYCB1K,"""Viva Zapata!"" is a fair to middling film that is expertly directed by Elia Kazan, with terrific cinematography and some excellent location shooting.  The problems lie with an underdeveloped John Steinbeck script that includes sketchy characterizations and plotting, and a strangely detached Marlon Brando in the title role.  Aside from the whitewashed casting, which was business-as-usual for 1952, Brando's accent is inconsistent and he never seems to fully invest in the role.  Of all his prime era performances, this is easily the least effective.  Still, it's worth a look ... certainly for Kazan fans but also for Brando completists.  Anthony Quinn is effective in a small, Academy Award winning role as Zapata's brother.",1520467200,,727,5.398230088495575
8570661,5,B00BLYCB1K,"A wonderfully directed movie with great leading actors.  I saw it as a teen and was most impressed by Brando.  Many decades later, I am still impressed by the film overall.  A worthwhile film in any collection.",1519862400,,210,4.621621621621622
8570662,5,B00BLYCB1K,What can you say about a movie that features Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn directed by the great Elia Kazan. Excellent and timeless.,1504310400,,134,4.869565217391305

8570666,5,B00BLYCB1K,"It's a corny political melodrama, with a lot of poetic license taken, from the 50s but Brando is red hot. Anthony Quinn adds a lot to the dramatization. It's very inaccurate as history, but is entertaining at best.",1483488000,,214,4.657894736842105
