8326665,5,B001NF6T0Q,I enjoyed watching this and seeing the next generation caring so much for our planet.  These DVD's do a good job showing us all what can be done especially when we all work together. I have watched this two times already and will probably watch again soon.  I hope that they will have another season of Alter Eco.,1315094400,,313,4.379310344827586
8326666,5,B001NF6T0Q,"I found the series to be fascinating. I never knew so many Eco friendly ideas were out there!! Although Adrian Grenier created this, the series really follows up on some very exciting and helpful ideas on how to make the planet more eco friendly starting in your own back yard. I recommend it just for the information itself.",1289520000,,325,4.620689655172414
8326667,5,B001NF6T0Q,"Planet Green had a lot riding on this show, because Adrian Grenier has a very successful series on HBO. Sadly, Planet Green, which used to be the conservative Home Channel, didn't have the young viewers necessary to give this wonderful series the success it deserved.

Planet Green is a luxury for homeowners, an additional expense on the cable bill, usually part of the extended package. The 20 somethings Alter Eco show rings true with didn't have a chance to see on television, unless they sat in their parents house. They would have quickly become addicted to it though if Planet Green had also made the decision to webcast.

I enjoyed the show tremendously, because of its charm, its pacing, its humor, its gentle connection to its surroundings, its people, the general sense of laisser faire and savoir faire... It might play much better on a European audience than in America, because it certainly has that Los Angeles lifestyle and attitude. Nobody yells or shouts, or throws things, no temper tantrums. Imagine, a good vibes show.

The people you see on screen, are friends, comrades, they share a common goal and vision, they are enjoying their lives, they're not down on the world because the planet is falling apart. They're learning as they go. They're young. They separate themselves from what we need to do as human beings to fix things, from the anger that the first reviewer harbors at the world. Yes, the Blue Meanies are monsters... we are up against the evil empire. But let it rest man, the facts speak for themselves.

Each episodes ends in wine and song. But the products and services Alter Eco showcases in each episodes are one step ahead of the pack. An entire art gallery is retrofited to Light Emitting Diode, replacing halogen while the mainstream is still debating incandescent vs fluorescent. Alter Eco was cutting edge last year. Remains so now.

Darren, Boise and Angela take you all over LA, to San Diego, to great kitchens, green centers, to a music festival... you meet wonderful people. As you sit enjoying this show, you're made to feel you're on board, the fourth wall easily falls away to reveal some very talented artists.

If you're an environmental activist, developing the green economy... if you need to present these ideas to college students, to high schools, this is the way to do it. They will feel kinship, this show will speak to them.

My only regret is that they didn't have a chance to see it the first time around, that Planet Green didn't have it set up to put the show online, encouraging interactivity between the stars, its audience and all the businesses involved.

Each member of the cast have gone on to bigger and better things, while this DVD series remain a testament to a great experience.

Bravo.",1242691200,,2763,4.78781512605042
8326668,5,B001NF6T0Q,"I think the previous viewer, Mr. Lebryk, while entitled to his opinions is a bit inaccurate on his review. While the claim to the pretext of the show is green renovation, it is not solely an instructional show on eco remodeling.  That is what the program ""Renovate Nation"" is geared for.  It would be redundant having 2 similar shows on a growing network.  The show is not intended for a Home Depot/Bob Villa step 1-10 show because not enough mainstream folks would watch that, especially the youth. I actually enjoy the side projects they do while renovating.  The side projects range from visiting schools to pampering visits.  Pampering is unnecessary but lets face it, this is America who loves to pamper themselves.

I think the series ""Alter Eco"" is great to open eyes all over the world.  Our society has come to loving ""American Idol"".  Unfortunately, it will take celebrities for the world to catch on about the environment and the true ""reality"".  We live in such a disregard, selfish, unnecessary consumption and wasteful society right now that it's good to see the crew go off on a tangent while on the green renovation.  It shows how when they do go off on a tangent, that they are reaching out to schools and to the community to get the 'ecolution' going.  They try to get in touch with what normal people do, especially the ones who are high consumers.  They find restaurants, clubs, shops and much more that are contributing to decrease our ""carbon footprint"" on our environment.  It has to start somewhere.  The majority of our eco problems stems from the factories and industrial pollutants and depletion of resource.  But the root cause of the pollution production is not the factories in in itself but the demand of which we the people create.  If a show like this can open peoples eyes and rethink demand, it just might make a difference.

PS. Planet Green (affiliate with the Discovery Channel) did pick up this show on the cable network.",1239062400,,1960,4.734513274336283
