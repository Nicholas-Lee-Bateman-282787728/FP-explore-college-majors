505275,4,6302682630,"Frank Sinatra was known to be a difficult, one-take actor and studio singer; this is, perhaps, the first of a number of films which showcase him playing himself throughout the film.  The Voice sang and shuffled his way through several well-done musicals in his career, yet transcended them in the bold and successful step into drama.  From Here To Eternity played on pathos, and this second film offering from the same writer does likewise.  An abandoned boy grows up to become a respected writer, then enters the war as a soldier.  Upon discharge, he finds himself poured into a Greyhound bus, pulling into the hometown he hates, with an enamoured floozy.  Minelli directs with a real-time matter-of-fact effect, with excellent support from all.  Small town America equals small mind America as personified by the soldier's social climbing brother and bitchy sister-in-law, who are more worried about their now-sullied reputation in town than about the ex-writer's alcoholism, cynicism, and lack of self-confidence.  But Frank's character is not two-dimensional; it shows courage, insight, pity, love, and self-loathing. Any more would give the plot away.  Frank's an heroic heel, Dean's a smooth-talking lush (no stretches there) and Shirl's a loopy barfly. This film was reviewed based the wide-screen version, which is especially effective in the final, chaotic scene, reminiscent of Hitchcock's in Strangers On A Train.",1021248000,5,1424,5.354260089686099

All are fine, especially Shirley MacLaine,Dean Martin and Arthur Kennedy, and Minnelli's lifelike pacing leads to an unforgettable, transcendent conclusion.

505277,5,6302682630,"This is one of the most heart-rending films I have ever seen. There are many levels in this story of the returning soldier, Dave Hirsh: his conflict with his brother, with his community, with his beloved and with himself. But for me, the most poignant is the story of Dave Hirsh (Frank Sinatra) and Ginny Moorhead (Shirley Maclaine). Dave is searching for redemption; he is emotionally needy and spiritually enervated. He thinks he can find love in someone who can fill his creative needs and the void in his heart created by the war.
Here is the tragedy: Dave does not realize that real love can only come from a sense of self worth, from finding someone whom he not only needs but, just as important, who needs him. Ginny is an angel, an angel in the form of a wrong-side-of-the-tracks bimbo; but of all those in Dave's world, Ginny is the purest of heart and the purest in love, and her love is for Dave. When Dave finally realizes that his bliss lies with Ginny, it is too late, for both him and Ginny. And this ending comes in a moment that left me shattered, my mouth agape.
While the ending was not expected, neither was it contrived, and with hindsight, one could see its coming.
""Some Came Running"" captures a time and culture only now beginning to fade from the collective memory, as its cohort ages and dies off, America immediately following World War II. And as a period piece, ""Some Came Running"" is quite successful. But I believe the story depicted here is a universal one, and I think the characters of Dave and Ginny and their sidekick Bama, played wonderfully by Dean Martin, are to be found anywhere. In fact, ""Some Came Running,"" along with ""From Here to Eternity,"" is the closest American cinema has come to being Shakespearian, without consciously trying to be.",993254400,32,1784,4.613207547169812

505321,5,6302682630,"Review of ""Some Came Running""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Its difficult to sum up Some Came Running in a sentence. If only allowed one sentence, Id merely tell my readers to watch the film, no questions asked. I watched it a few years ago, and its stayed with me, vivid and haunting, ever since.

Thankfully, I can use many more sentences to praise the 1958 Oscar nominated (but not winning) film. While Shirley MacLaine, Arthur Kennedy, and Martha Hyer were nominated for their performances, Frank Sinatra was snubbed. For Best Actor and Actress of 1958, David Niven and Susan Hayward were honored. I am huge fans of both, but I would have awarded both lead performances in Some Came Running over the Academys choices that year.

It takes place in a small Americana town, where secrets simmer under the surface, but its not in any way a dated film. Frank Sinatra plays the Prodigal Son, a veteran and an author, who returns to his hometown and his family after a 16-year absence. Unlike many stories with that beginning, the absent son is not welcomed back with open arms. His brother has become a successful, upstanding member of society, and his family looks down on Sinatras drinking, gambling, and lowbrow friends.

Sinatra gives a wonderful, tragically torn performance. He falls in love with the elegant Martha Hyer and wants to make himself worthy of her, but feels the pull of his old lifestyle bringing him down. The audience is completely invested in him, cheering when he takes a step forward, and crying out when Dean Martin, a bad influence gambler, drags him two steps backwards. Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year Ill never know.

Shirley MacLaine gives the performance of her career in this film. And, since shes given incredibly powerful performances in The Childrens Hour, Terms of Endearment, Bernie, Two for the Seesaw, and Postcards from the Edge, I realize what a bold statement I just made. Its true. Ever since her 1983 Oscar, shes (for the most part) been typecast as a tough broad. Modern audiences probably cant imagine her in a part where she doesnt spew memorable zingers in every scene. However gutsy and fantastic her persona is now, she wasn't always that way. In Some Came Running, Shirley MacLaine shows talents most people wouldnt dream she had. Shes feminine, vulnerable, sweet, and hopeful. Shes soiled but still innocent, common but reaching for class, loving, and sensitive.

With a heartbreaking love triangle, some very steamy scenes at the demise of the Hays Code, incredible acting, and Vincente Minnellis gentle direction, Some Came Running is one of the best films of the 1950s. Its a true classic.",1498435200,,2659,4.858719646799117

505325,5,6302682630,"No question I was first drawn to Some Came Running, a film based on the novel of the same name by James Jones whose more famous novel Here To Eternity also was adapted to the screen and stands as one of the great classic films of the modern cinema, by the ex-soldiers story and then by his plight as a blocked writer. The draw of the ex-soldiers story reflected something that had been in my own experience about coming back to the real world after the military. That seems to be the character played by Frank Sinatra Dave Hirshs situation. That inability to go to the nine to five routine, to settle down after military service had shaken him out of his routine rang a bell. In my own military service generation, in my own service, I ran across plenty of guys who couldn't deal with the real world coming back from Vietnam and who tried to hide from that fact as brothers under the bridges alternate communities out in places like Southern California. I see and hear about young Iraq and Afghanistan War service personnel having the same woes and worse, having incredibly high suicide rates. So yeah, I was drawn to Daves sulky, moody, misshapen view of the world.

The story line is a beauty. Dave, after a drunk spree, finds he was shipped by bus back in that state by some guys in Chicago to his Podunk hometown in Parkman, Indiana, a town he had fled with all deliberate speed when he was a kid orphaned out by his social-climbing older brother Frank because, well, because he was in the way of that social-climb after their parents die. Dave was not alone in his travels though since he had picked up, or had been attached to, a floozy named Ginny, played by Shirley MacLaine, who will make life hell for him in the end. As he became accustomed to his old hometown and while deciding whether to stay or pick up stakes (the preferred fate of his brother and his also social-climbing wife) he was introduced to a local school teacher Gwen, played by Martha Hyer, who will also make hell for him in the end since he was quickly and madly in love with her but she was seriously stand-offish almost old maid stand-offish since she had had a few tastes of his rough-hewn low life doings. Doings which were encouraged by a gambler, Bama, played by Dean Martin who became his sidekick.

But here is the hook that almost saved Dave and almost lit a spark under dear Gwen. Dave was a blocked writer, had some time before written a couple of books that were published and had gathered some acclaim, were well written. Gwen attempted to act as his muse, and did prove instrumental in getting a work of his published. To no avail since Dave was not looking for a muse, well, not a muse who wasn't thinking about getting under the silky sheets. No go, no go despite Daves ardent efforts. Frustrated Dave turned to Ginny and whatever charms she had-and the fact that she loved him unconditionally despite their social and intellectual differences. In the end Dave in a fit of hubris decided to marry Ginny after being rebuffed by Gwen enough times. The problem though was that Ginny had a hang on gangster guy trailing her who was making threatening noises about putting Dave, and or Ginny underground. In the end they were not just threatening noises as he wounded Dave and killed poor bedraggled Ginny. Watch this one-more than once and read James Jones book too which includes additional chapters about those soldiers who could not relate to the real world after their military experiences. This guy could write sure write about that milieu based on his own military service. (There is a famous photograph of Jones, Norman Mailer, and William Styron, the three great soldier boy American literary lights of the immediate post-World War II war period with Jones in uniform if I recall.)",1489968000,,3780,4.590236686390533
505326,4,6302682630,"Bottom Line First: Some very good acting by the leads and by a mile Shirley MacLaine owns her every scene. Direct Vincent Minnelli is not at his best and Frank Sinatra knew it. Some Came Running is a 1950 period piece somewhere between a soap opera and a fair insight into small Town America post WWII and absent awareness of Korea. Worth at least one viewing for the interested and worth buying for collectors and film buffs for any of several reason. For me Some Came Running is a serious move with its emotional depth flowing from Shirley MacLaine. Between Sinatras lack of commitment to the role and Minnelli uneven direction, this is not the movie it could have been. A good movie, but less than its parts.

An earlier reviewer here has suggested that Some Came Running is a continuation of writer James Jones From Here to Eternity trilogy. This is an intelligent observation. The movie opens with a hung over, worldly wise discharged Amy Private Dave Hirsh (Frank Sinatra) returns home to his home in small town mid-west America. Couple of points. He is not just a returning war veteran, he is a published author even if his writing career has stalled. I do not see any signs of stripes on his arm.  The impression is that he had served long enough that the lack of stripes can suggest that he had not gotten along well in the Army. James Jones a war time vet would have known this. Speculation on my part.

Sinatras Dave is a believable character, even if Sinatra clearly did not commit to the role and evidently did not like Minnellis directing.
Hirsh arrives in town with a tag along woman, Ginnie Moorehead (Shirley MacLaine). Ginnie is not very bright, is morally questionable, has terrible taste in clothes and makeup and is not built for the more complex and thoughtful world of a writer. MacLaine gives her heart, depth and honesty.

Davres brother Frank (Arthur Kennedy), missed the war instead staying home and becoming a successful jewelry store owner and major name in this small town. Following is wifes preferences and Daves misbehavior, he shoulders his brother out of polite society and into a partnership with Bama Dillert. Bama is a gambler and womanizer and hardly a stretch for Dean Martin who play his role to the hilt.

There being no need to go into more plot, instead there is the director Vincnet Minnelli. Best known for musicals, Some Came Running was supposed to prove he was also able to direct serious drama. He can and cannot. Twice he will use a technique of fading to a single color with his actors in sharp silhouette. The staging looks too much like he will have the actor break out in song. In the last case it is cartoonish and forced. Other scenes look to be staged as for a musical. I found this distracting.

Most famous is the carnival scene. At its best, it is wonderfully shot. At its best it is small town Americana with exactly the kinds of made for the rubes games and realistic sales presentation. All the crowds and rush of people just about to become immaterial. At its worst, are any of the rides real?

A wonderful scene takes place in the Evil Big City where Dave and Bama take their girls. A very drunk Ginnie gets up to sing over the night club quartet and massacres a song the real Shirley could have done in lovely rendition except that that was not how her character could have performed.

About the ending, were I writing a film critic's  review I would have much to say. Rather a spoiler here would be unfair.",1489881600,,3474,4.572347266881029

I saw this film in early young manhood, perhaps 17 or 18, and I liked the character of an alienated writer coming back to his small town and falling in with the demimondaines of Indiana.  I identified with Dave Hirsch, and still do. I attended a few lectures at the American Film Institute back in 1990, and the director under discussion was Vincent Minelli; the instructor for the class went through the film and demonstrated clearly how like one of Minelli's musical films (Carousel, American in Paris) SCR was.  Well shot, well acted, and scored perfectly by Elmer Bernstein, the film still falls somewhat flat.  Perhaps if Elia Kazan had taken this property on, the film would have been deeper.  Yet, the impossibility of love (and sex) is so rampant in this film that the tortured, self-destructive characters do take on life.  Certainly, Dean Martin never out did this role, although Sinatra sometimes phones in his lines. Shirley MacLaine, as the clueless trollop working in a bra-factory walks off with your emotions.

I don't subscribe to what currently passes as ""feminist"" sensibilities which IMHO have become cartoonish. That said, this story, as filmed, is so sexist and hateful to women it's cringeworthy and just about unwatchable in 2015. You've got your frigid schoolteacher, your sex-averse social climbing wife, your sluts, your wayward daughter who gets her mind right just before becoming a ""tramp"", and lest we forget, you've got your secretary who, after sleeping with the boss in a weak moment, is slut-shamed into leaving town while said boss simply goes on with his hypocritical life. Unreal. That said, Shirley Maclaine is wonderful in a role that could have been comical given the movie's interpretation of the socio-sexual mores of the time.

505421,3,6302682630,"Vincente Minnelli had a great eye for creating striking images and a designers sense of color, so the film looks great. Especially the last twenty minutes. But that's the only good thing about this overheated soap.
  Sinatra gives the best performance, and Dean Martin, who can be a terrific actor, contributes little, because the screenplay gives him nothing to work with. Shirley MacLaine gives the same teary, shrieking performance she gave in every film she made around this time, and everyone, apart from Martha Hyer, is too old for the roles they're playing. Elmer Bernstein tries to whip up some musical excitement, but the excellent jazzy score is at odds with what's taking place on the screen. The music is suggesting sex, but there is not a minute of sexual heat in the entire film. Sinatra and MacLaine feel more like brother and sister that passionate lovers.
  It's also worth noting Sinatra's influence on the casting. He got Martin and MacLaine the supporting roles, and he also influenced the end of the film, much to Minnelli's frustration, who was essentially dealing with three difficult stars who were also members of a private 'club.' Apparently Sinatra insisted on a different ending to the one in the screenplay, because he felt that if it was altered, MacLaine would get an Oscar. Enough said.
  Joanne Woodward was the original choice for Ginny, but  she refused to work with Sinatra, and left the project, which is a pity. I think she would have been great in this role.
  But some people revere this film. I'm just not one of them.
  One astute reviewer here has mentioned the very obvious lack of close ups throughout the film which has the tendency to keep the viewer  distanced from the drama. This is because the Cinemascope process during the earlier days of it's use, made closeups problematic. There were serious distortions when the cameras got too close to people's faces.

The best performance in the film is Shirley MacLaine as Ginny, the floosey who accompanies Sinatra's character home to Indiana.  It seemed rather implausible that a 40 something Sinatra should portray an Army private just discharged after WW2.  Seemed a little old for the part. The scenes with Sinatra and Martha Hyer are almost uncomfortable, with one moment she is overcome with lust for the guy and then is cold as a glacier.  Having not read the book I had a hard time understanding this relationship. Maybe I'm a little slow. Dean Martin is great as Bama, the hard drinker and gambler. This, I guess, wasn't really acting for him and probably why he comes off so smooth. Although I like the movie, some parts were especially hard to take, such as when Ginny goes to the college to tell the lady professor of her love for Sinatra.  In the end I'm not sure about Frank's feelings for Ginny. Was it love or sympathy. I just didn't get it, I guess.",1409616000,,1004,4.524861878453039

505475,5,6302682630,"A post-war bumming around trying-to-be-modern novel, with a little of sex and naughty in it is one the best 'small town hypocrisy' commentaries that seemed to be in vogue after WWII. Based on the hot James Jones bestseller, it kinda feels like almost a sequel to his other titles FROM HERE TO ETERNITY and THE THIN RED LINE. SOME which were also made in to films.

This Jones story is about a blocked writer ex GI who returns to his small town home town of Parkman, Indiana, in 1948, after 12 year absence. Frank Sinatra plays Dave Hirsch, who was actually ""sent home"" on a bus by his service buddies after he'd gotten 'blotto'. The surprise is that sweet but du,b pushover Ginnie Moorehead, played to heart aching perfection by Shirley MacLaine, tagged along with him on the trip from Chicago. Arthur Kennedy plays Dave's older brother Frank, a seemingly upstanding, well connected businessman in the small town Parkman community. Add to the mix Edith, Frank's attractive young secretary (beautiful Nancy Gates) in his jewelry store and let the hypocrisy begin.

I've read people who call ""Some Came Running"" a 'glossy soap opera' thin broth with little story or interesting characters. Only in our shallow social media big explosion day would such a superior character study, loaded with story; gritty circumstance and conflicted human characters could this film be seen as anything resembling pulp/tabloid rubbish.

This is a story about a time when American GIs were expected to be pious, family value Christians. After all, they just lead a great crusade to save the world from the purest evils yet imagined. Depending on which small towns they returned to more or less came home to morals from the 1800s waiting for them. GIs now fought to get out from under their family's roofs ASAP. The truth is this time after the World War II is when those 'great guys' who had just looked that evil in the face and saw the death and destruction that followed, really just wanted to get home, get drunk and get laid....and get drunk and get laid is what they did (the result was your parents) and that is exactly what they do in Jones' novel and is more than alluded to in this film version. The American small town moral hypocrisy that was being tossed aside for a new hunger to live. Jones' characters and their real life counterparts they represent were the guys who did it. Those are the people you're seeing...yep your grandparents.

Ol' Blue Eyes, is as good and broody as ever as Jones' wayward, heavy soul writer. His Rat Pack, on and off-screen drinking buddy Dean-O Martin is nothing short of brilliant, playing to his breezy, kind'a real-life self. The film is given heart and lifted from it's brooding melodramatic characters by the heartbreaking, sad, traumatic, harrowing; pitiful, plaintive, moving, tearjerker, tearjerking, gut-wrenching tragic, painful, disturbing, poignant and all too human performance by Shirley MacLaine, whose self-sacrificing, tragic, heart sick Ginny really gets right under your skin and ties you emotionally to the very last frame.

505544,4,6302682630,"""Some Came Running"" is regarded by some as a kind of sequel to ""From Here to Eternity"".  In this movie, the disillusioned soldier/writer returns to his hometown, trying to square his creative impulses with his dissolute lifestyle.

As with Montgomery Clift's character in ""A Place in the Sun"",  Frank Sinatra's down-at-the-mouth character in this film faces a choice between an educated, upper-class, beautiful woman (Martha Hyer) and a good-hearted but dumb girl (Shirley MacLaine) who desperately wants to get married.

A Fifties melodrama in the mode of ""Peyton Place"", the main appeal of this moderately entertaining film for me was some brief but enchanting glimpses of a thriving small town (Madison, Indiana) as Sinatra rolls in on a gleaming Greyhound bus in the beginning of the story, past a huge old Rexall drugstore.  There are also some great scenic views of the Ohio river, near which Hyer's character resides in relative cultural splendor:  a house with so many books that they spill over into the kitchen.  Unfortunately, Hyer's teacher is neurotic enough that she still lives with her father (what's he supposed to be, ""Prospero""?).

Everything about this film is a little ""over-the-top"".  Some of the dialogue is pretty pathetic, with  lines such as Sinatra's when he exits a bar:  ""Take this dough and buy yourself a quonset hut"".  It must have passed as hip at the time.  Plus, Elmer Bernstein's musical score is a cluttered paste-up of cliches, from the swaggering horns that accompany Sinatra's barroom visits, to the Delilah-like strains of the flute which adorn a scene where Sinatra loosens Hyer's hair.

Director Vincent Minnelli makes effective use of color in this movie, particularly in the final scene of the street carnival.  And Shirley MacLaine does a wonderful job with her ""Shelly Winters"" role. ( By the way, it was Sinatra who suggested the final fate of MacLaine's character... telling Minnelli that it would ""make the kid more sympathetic"".  So, strangely enough, Sinatra had an unseen hand in the acclaim that MacLaine reaped for her performance.)

There probably is a correlation between this film and the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, such as ""All That Heaven Allows"".  But Sirk's movies are much more subversive. ""Some Came Running"" is just a quirky souvenir of the Fifties, fun though it may be.",1313625600,,2337,5.089238845144357

505579,3,6302682630,"I am a huge fan of Shirley MacLaine.  I consider her one of our finest actresses of all time and simply adore everything she touches (almost).  After seeing `The Manchurian Candidate' I wasn't too keen on watching another Frank Sinatra movie, but my friends were telling me just how wonderful MacLaine is here, and so I just needed to see this.  I did, and while I can't say that the movie itself is one I'd rush out to watch again, I must admit that MacLaine's performance ranks at the top of my list as one of the greatest supporting performances of all time (in fact, recently some friends and I ranked our top 5 in each of Oscar's categories and MacLaine made it on all our ballots for this performance, ranking in at number 3 for me personally).

The film follows G.I. Dave Hirsh as he comes home after a long absence and a string of unsuccessful novels.  Hoping to start over and write something great, Hirsh winds up involved with a professional gambler, a floozy, a mannered schoolteacher and his brother, Frank, who is far from perfect himself (although a lot self-righteous).

I know that a lot of people just ate this movie up, but personally I couldn't really fall in love with it.  I felt that the storyline was intriguing enough (failed writer searching for himself amidst people he rarely connects to) and I felt that as a whole the acting was rather good (MacLaine was impeccable, Martin was remarkable, Kennedy and Hyer were respectable and Sinatra was, well, decent) but there is just something missing here that made it hard for me to truly connect with.  I found myself simply satisfied, nothing more, nothing less.

It's not a bad film; it's just not a great one.  It's rather `middle of the road'.

As Hirsh, Sinatra is serviceable, but to be honest I find him rather bland at times.  He wasn't a very accomplished actor despite his accolades and large following.  I appreciate the talent he has (as a singer) but in the end his acting career leaves some to be desired.  This is probably the better of the performances I've seen, but it's not a knock out.  I think that he may be the biggest reason I couldn't `connect' with the film.  I found him to be off putting at times, and not in the `this is my character so admire my dedication to my role' kind of way; he was just `off putting'.  In order to really invest yourself in this film you have to be able to get inside Hirsh's head and relate to him, but Sinatra made that hard for me.  I felt a much deeper draw to the cast of character's that walked in and out of his life.

Martin fares better here, MUCH better.  He has the suave coolness about him that resonates very well with his character.  I would have much rather seen him collect a Supporting Actor nomination over Kennedy.  Kennedy has the right amount of nervous jitters to make his character likable despite his hypocrisy, and Hyer is enticing in her reserved affections.  The supporting cast is all really good, from Leora Dana's bossy demeanor to Nancy Gates' seductive presence and Betty Lou Keirn's adoring curiosity.

But no one, and I mean NO ONE, comes close to Shirley MacLaine.  Let me just say this; what MacLaine does here is beyond brilliant.  She is equal parts lovely and shrill, intriguing and repelling, adoring and annoying.  She manages to be the `complete person', giving us reason upon reason to keep watching the film with hopes of seeing more and more of her.  Her emotional connection to Sinatra's character (or shall I say her `need' to feel connected to something) is felt with every breath she takes, and the climax is so deeply moving (heartbreaking) that one cannot deny the connection they have made with this simple minded yet big hearted woman.

This is a performance for the ages and should have netted her the Oscar (albeit, she was nominated in the WRONG category).

In the end, I recommend this film for the performances, which for the most part are enough to carry the entire film.  It is lacking as a whole for me, but in the end it is far from bad and a film that will satisfy to say the least.  See it for MacLaine, seriously, because there are few performances this rich and this close to perfection.",1252972800,4,4179,4.545454545454546
505580,4,6302682630,"Director Vincente Minnelli is best rememberd as the great master of Hollywood-musicals, but he was also excellent director of comedies and melodramas.

Either you live in a sexless marriage as an ""honorable"" citizen, or then you'll be shut outside society as a prostitute, a gambler and/or an alcoholic.

In 1958 I was 16 years old and on a Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn trip down the Ohio River with a buddy in a little 16' boat, and we just happened to stop in Madison, Indiana where MGM was filming Some Came Running with Sinatra, Martin and MacLaine.  It's typical 1950's melodrama--nothing spectacular, except for one thing--Shirley MacLaine's performance as a good-hearted, wrong-side-of-the-tracks bimbo.  Spectacular! It makes the whole movie worth watching--especially the ending, which was a departure from the original script, but insisted upon by Frank, who wanted to help launch Shirley's career.  It worked too!  She was nominated for an Academy Award (tm).",1220054400,6,808,6.318181818181818
505583,4,6302682630,"""Some Came Running"", based on author James Jones' follow-up to his masterpiece, ""From Here to Eternity"", was a conscious effort by MGM to recapture the lightning of the earlier film, particularly in casting Frank Sinatra (who'd won an Oscar for ""Eternity""), in the lead, and assigning their best director, Vincente Minnelli, to helm the project. Unfortunately, ""Running"" was not in the same league as ""Eternity"", dramatically, but it is certainly a good film, made even better by two unusual casting choices, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine, in pivotal roles.

Part of the film's failure is the structure of the story, dark and anticlimactic, and another is Sinatra, who seems a bit miscast as the 'Great American Author' (I see him more likely a Mickey Spillane than a William Faulkner). Yet he very nearly pulls it off, thanks to MacLaine, as an uneducated waif who adores him, and Martin, a drawling, Stetson-wearing gambling buddy who hides his own demons behind an easy-going charm. In their devotion to the homecoming author, they make him stronger and far more interesting than he'd have been, without them.

Two other cast members are standouts; Arthur Kennedy not only looks like he could be Sinatra's brother, he succeeds in creating a persona perfectly suited to Parkman, Indiana, where a successful appearance hides a multitude of sins. Even better is Martha Hyer, as a very prim, uptight schoolteacher whose pent-up sexuality is unleashed when Sinatra pulls out the bobby pins holding her tightly-coiffed hair. Kennedy and Hyer personify the community, a virtual 'Peyton Place' of subliminal lusts, waiting for the right catalyst to explode, with cynical Sinatra's arrival providing the spark.

I can't praise Minnelli enough, for giving the film much of it's strength. While he fought Sinatra, whose different work ethics would cause a LOT of friction on the set, he created a series of powerful visual statements, most especially during the tense carnival finale. While the film isn't 'top drawer' Minnelli, it is indelibly his work, during one of the most productive periods of his career.

The Special Features of this DVD are very entertaining, if bordering on unabashed hero worship of Sinatra. I wish a LONG interview with Shirley MacLaine had been included, as I suspect she has a LOT of stories about Sinatra, Martin, and the production!

""Some Came Running"" was a box office and critical success, when released, in 1958, and the film has held up very well, over the years...while not everyone's 'cup of tea', it is certainly worth adding to your collection.",1215129600,3,2581,5.106635071090047
505584,4,6302682630,"Glad to find commentary here addressing director Vincente Minelli's contributions. He was not only acclaimed fo his successful musicals in the 1940s and early 1950s ('Meet Me in St. Louis,' 1944; 'An American in Paris,' 1951; 'The Band Wagon,' 1953; 'Brigadoon,' 1954) but also for dramas in the 1950s ('The Bad and the Beautiful' 1952; 'Lust for Life,' 1956; 'Tea and Sympathy,' 1956).

After the musicals that were his fort fell out of favor with audiences around the time of his Oscar winning 'Gigi' (1958) came out, Minelli still made very creditable work for MGM in comedy ('Designing Woman,' 1957, 'The Reluctant Debutante,' 1958, 'Bells Are Ringing,' 1960, 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father' 1963) others less so ('Goodbye Charlie,' 1964). But there was little to choose from in drama, so that he was assigned his share of potboilers ('The Cobweb,' 1955, 'Home from the Hill,' 1960; 'Two Weeks in Another Town,' 1962; 'The Sandpiper,' 1965); and yet, professional that he was, he rescued those otherwise forgettable movies from the tawdry with panache, and it is that touch of Minnelli's that make them watchable, if admittedly dated for contemporary audiences. Such is the case with 'Some Came Running,' 1958.

At the very beginning of the movie, a bus approaches Dave Hirsch's  home town in Indiana. Elmer Bernstein's movie score envelops us as we become aware of Dave (Sinatra), fast asleep in one of the seats. Through the melodramatic conclusion, as we follow a not-at-all unconventional narrative we are made to care about the characters, lead and secondary, flawed or virtuous, which always was Minelli's concern: that no one character is ever neglected. We see how understanding he is of Martha Hyer's straightlaced values or of the wonderful Ginny Moorehead (Shirley MacLaine). Sinatra's performance might not be too far from own experience but very creditable indeed, as are those of most others, particularly Dean Martin as 'Bama (""You know, ever since you've been seein' that schoolteacher, you've become im-possible?"" or some such.) Given that the scriptwriters are working from a James Jones novel ('From Here To Eternity'; 'The Thin Red Line'), you know that Minnelli is the artist to make it work. Truly underrated now, but not so to those of us who were fortunate enough to follow this director's career. A true favorite, despite the years gone past.",1211587200,,2373,5.126614987080103

Of course, Shirley is there, looking like a lovesick puppy,knowing all along that Sinatra has his eye on Martha Hyer, who appreciates his talent, as well as him but is too proud and high class to admit that to herself.

Minnelli's direction and score by Elmer Bernstein make this one of the last of the MGM classics.",1211068800,2,730,3.939189189189189
505587,5,6302682630,"To the untrained eye this 1958 Vincente Minnelli MGM melodrama looks like an excerise in Rat Pack sleaze, as it stars Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Shirley MacLaine at the summit of their ring-a-ding-ding hijinks. Don't be fooled -- this movie is absolutley dead serious, even as it flies as luridly over the top as the last act of a bel canto opera. Based on James (From Here to Eternity) Jones' unreadable novel, story tells of Dave Hersch (Sinatra), a just de-mobilized World War Two vet and novelist who returns to his small mid-Western hometown of Parkman, Ill. Hersch apparently was a troubled delinquent after being orphaned as a teen, and eventually his older brother (Arthur Kennedy) stuck him in an orphanage. Dave ran away, and this is his first time back in years. He had published some fiction with mixed success before the war, and now he's blocked and trying to figure out his next move. His brother, who is now owner of the local bank and a pillar of the community, is terrified Dave is a)out for some kind of revenge and b)will do something to bring scandal down on his good name. Parkman, incidentally, is the kind of white-picket fence churchgoing place where every pillar of the community family man harbors a drinking problem, a mistress, and teenage kids who are veering towards delinquency.

As the older brother correctly feared, Dave has grown up to be a tough, cynical, hard-drinking womanizer who trouble usually follows, and as soon as he arrives in pastoral Parkman, he gravitates to the Wrong Side of the Tracks, sleazy downtown taverns where professional gambler 'Bama Dillard (Dino) hold court, surrounded by the local working-girls (MacLaine being the most outrageously trashy and dumb -- but with a heart of gold and an indescribable wardrobe). Dave spends his nights drowning in dissolute behavior with the Pack, and his days trying to hammer out a novel, under the watchful eye of the frigid yet beautiful local patroness of the arts (Martha Hyer), who sees in Dave a new Thomas Wolfe. The suspicion soon arises that Dave has only started writing again to see if he can meet the challenge of getting the 40-year old virgin into bed.

It is not long before the three worlds Dave attempts to integrate -- the country club world of his  brother, Dino's sleazy dives, and Hyer's isolated writer's workshop/mansion/sexless life of the mind -- create only conflicts that messes up everyone in the town of Parkman.
Dave's conflict between the life of the artist and his attraction to the working class lower depths pre-figures Jack Nicholson's similar conflict in Five Easy Pieces over a decade later.

Except this isn't the ersatz Antonioni-world of Pieces; this is a full-blown technicolor melodrama with a fabulous Elmer Bernstein score, that puts the ""opera"" back in soap opera. Best described as somewhere between Peyton Place and Blue Velvet, Some Came Running belongs to the melodrama subgenre of ""Let's look beneath the placid suburban surface and see what maggots crawl out."" A very prevalent theme in '50's cinema (see the works of Douglas Sirk), I believe this genre was the descendant of '40's noir, as it allowed subversive film-makers to illustrate the moral and sexual hypocracies of our ""straightest"" communities and citizens, thus prefiguring 1960's concerns in the supposedly placid Eisenhower era. ""Some Came Running"" is of particular interest in that it deploys the sleazy mores and manners of the town's underclass to critique the respectable citizens of Parkman.

Director Minelli, known for his studio-bound, arty musicals, made the decision to shoot on location in a small Indiana town; yet the movie's deranged lighting, elaborate set-dressing and color palette(the bars are eyeball searing infernal visions in red and green neon reminiscent of the joint in Fire Walk With Me),over-the-top performances and wall-to-wall music defeat naturalism. While dramatically a tad aimless (the book its based on is as long as War & Peace, no joke)""Some Came Running"" is perhaps the most visually sumptuous of '50's melodramas -- Visconti comes to the Midwest. And the climax -- a nearly wordless dance of death at a garish night-time carnival -- is a classic Minelli set-piece, an inversion of his trademark musical numbers, representing a nightmare rather than a dream. Where Minnelli's first great musical, ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" lyrically waxed nostaligic about midwestern small town virtues, ""Some Came Running"" luridly lingers over midwestern smalltown vices without a hint of nostalgia or sentiment.

This is a fascinating period piece, doubly interesting to see the aesthete Minelli wallow in sleaze. And Frank and Dino turn in solid in-character performances, and don't sing a note. MacLaine's trashy B-Girl, who loves Dave unconditionally even as he treats her like a doormat, is both bravely over-the-top and very poignant, the most memorable of the gallery of prostitutes she typically played in her early career.

Finally, if you're a fan of 50's -early '60's long-take,Cinemascope/Technicolor mise-en-scene, all eye-popping color, oddball camera angles, and cluttered compositions, this is really one of the finest examples, the kind of thing that routinely sent Jean-Luc Godard into raptures when he was a critic at Cahiers du Cinema. It looks like a Renaissance fresco, a style that has been lost in our post-TV/CGI stylistic era.",1204243200,68,5391,5.133257403189066
505588,5,6302682630,"Like L. Schafer and Dennis Welsh, I am from Madison, IN, where this movie was filmed, so that's one big reason I'm very fond of it. I was 13 at the time of filming, and well remember the excitement of having ""big stars"" in our town and of kids my age being selected as extras. I also remember stories of how Sinatra and Martin often disappeared from town in a chauffeured limousine to go up the Ohio River to Newport, Ky., gamble and seek female companionship; and how Sinatra made himself thoroughly disliked by frequent drunkenness and generally acting like a jerk while he was here.

The powers that be in Madison didn't do too well by their town, either, however, as they cautioned MGM to keep the wages paid to local extras low; can't get our hoi polloi to thinking they deserve decent pay, now can we?

But having said that, I'll add that the film is a great experience for those who want to see how people dressed, talked and lived in the late 1950s. In my case (I'm a retired newspaper reporter), it's one of the few convincing explorations I've seen of how writers tend to act and think, and some of the problems we face with putting our thoughts to paper, getting them published, and all the while feeling that our stuff is really, truly no good.

Sinatra as Dave Hirsh may seem at first to be walking through his role as the frustrated, alcoholic author, but repeated viewings of the picture will reveal that his performance is far more subtle and complicated than it first appears. Watch his facial expressions and body language, and they'll often tell you volumes.

Martin as Bama Dillert is brilliant. His repeated derogatory comments about women have earned him condemnation as a misogynist in reviews of recent years, but they fit perfectly with his character and the mores of the times.

Of course Shirley MacLaine as Ginny Moorhead is charming, delightful and tragic, all at once. Sinatra suggested a change in the climactic scene of the film to give a boost to the then-young MacLaine's career -- a generous act on his part.

Arthur Kennedy is sometimes just a hair over the top as Dave Hirsh's successful but frustrated older brother, Frank. But he also furnishes some of the film's best moments of subtle, unintended humor.

It's a good flick, folks, well worth seeing. And if you're from Madison and too young to remember the filming, some exterior scenes will show you what our town looked like, circa 1958.",1188604800,6,2430,4.65034965034965

505612,3,6302682630,"At 1200+ pages the James Jones novel ""Some Came Running"" deals with family divisions, drinking, gambling, sexual repression, adultery and other small town USA vices. All this is embedded in a general theme about the hypocrisy so pervasive in 1948 Middle America.

Jones was most famous for his explorations of WWII and its aftermath. ""Some Came Running"" is somewhat autobiographical as Jones was one of those returning soldiers from WWII whose long absence gave them a new perspective on details in the social fabric that they had not really noticed before. He was from a small town in Illinois and served in the 25th Infantry Division. He was present during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the battle of Guadalcanal. Basing ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Thin Red Line on his experiences.

The film adaptation of ""Some Came Running"" is long but entertaining, especially if you like seeing a lot of big-name stars. Despite its setting in a small town (it was filmed in Madison, Indiana) this was a big budget epic picture.

The Jones character is named Dave Hirsch and played by Frank Sinatra. He is a successful writer but has not written anything for several years. The film begins inside a bus on its way to Dave's hometown of Parkman, Indiana. He has just been discharged from the army and is wearing his uniform (no rank insignia is visible).

His brother Frank (Arthur Kennedy) has become a big shot in the town and introduces him to Gwen French (Martha Hyer), a college literature teacher who is impressed with his writing but put off by his wild life style. Dave has been followed to Parkton by Ginny (Shirley MacLaine), an airhead he met in a Chicago bar. This sets up the film's love triangle.

Dave becomes friends with a local gambler named Bama Dillert (Dean Martin), moves into his house, and pairs up with him on the regional poker circuit where they are very successful.

While Dave tries to come to terms with his roots and with his future, his brother Frank begins an affair with his secretary.

Generally speaking, adopting a 1200 page book to the screen is ill advised and ""Some Came Running"" is no exception, if only because the screenwriter incorporated too much of the story for a feature length film to handle effectively.

But the producers compounded this problem with the hiring Vincente Minnelli as director and by casting for box office draw instead of acting talent. This resulted in a film with slick production values, an extremely thin plot, lots of characters (but none with any depth), and a too long running time. Can you say flat, lifeless, prosaic, and unconvincing?

Minnelli was a freak about visual details. He was more interested in whether an actress' dress coordinated well with the wallpaper in the set than how the actress handled her character. The inexperienced MacLaine has commented on how the only guidance she received during filming was from her male co-stars. In fact it was Sinatra who insisted the film end differently than the book as a way to make MacLaine's character more memorable. Minnelli's lack of interest in acting for the camera made him an especially poor choice for an overloaded film that needed subtle and nuanced elements in each scene to flesh out the characterization.

For the same reason, a non-actor like ""one-take"" Sinatra was completely over-matched by the demands of playing his character. Sinatra was comfortable playing himself in front of the camera and in most of his roles this was more than satisfactory, as it is during the early stages of ""Some Came Running"". But things start to crash and burn with the start of his scenes with Hyer, and the film essentially collapses the first time he reveals that he loves her.

Because of time constraints this romance had to be compressed, requiring a really skilled performance to set up things for the declaration of love, if it is to be at all convincing. Even if Sinatra took direction well (he didn't) and even if Minnelli was a master of acting for the camera (few were worse), the sudden transformation from Sinatra to lovesick puppy would have been a difficult sell.

A very interesting element of this film is Minnelli's obsession with the sets and the moving camera. There are no close-ups and relatively few medium shots. Almost everything is a wide shot or the master shot itself. This could reflect Minnelli's overriding interest in showcasing his sets, or indicate that Sinatra's work habits made changing camera setups difficult, or that the editor found that many of the performances could not withstand close scrutiny. Whatever the cause, it makes it much more difficult to identify and connect with characters who are always so distant from the camera. This is a detail you may want to watch for the next time you see the film.

This was Dean Martin's signature performance and he is truly excellent. Arthur Kennedy won an Oscar for his portrayal of Frank Hirsh but I think the best performance of all was by Leora Dane as his wife Agnes. Their scenes together have real energy, and almost creepy believability.

It was difficult to understand the intense loyalty he provokes in the gambler Bama (Dean Martin) and the floozy Ginny (Shirley MacLaine).  Magnificent work by MacLaine and supporting actor Arthur Kennedy, as Sinatra's brother, are not enough to save the film.

Anyway, Sinatra's good, and MacLaine is very good, but Dean Martin is beautiful.  Very understated, he also had a great skill for using props on film (watch him dealing cards and holding his hat).  Arthur Kennedy got an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Frank's rather weasel-ish brother.
