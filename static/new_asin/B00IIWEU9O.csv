6265609,2,B00IIWEU9O,"As far as the ""land shark"" genre is concerned, I think the SyFy movie ""Ghost Shark"" had a lot more to offer.  Well, maybe not that much more.  But a little.

I'd only give it one star, but my 10 year old son says it should get two because ""it sucked, but it still had some laughs.""",1444953600,,281,3.8947368421052633

6265615,2,B00IIWEU9O,"I've got to stop watching these stupid shark movies. Last week, Sharknado 3. This week, Avalanche Sharks. At least, Sharknado 3 had some laughs and some semblance of acting talent. The only things Avalanche Sharks does right is the gore and putting some hot women in bikinis. Both will only take you so far, unless you're a teenage male. The script sucks. To end, there are moments of fun sprinkled throughout this movie. However, you have to wade through lots of boredom and unoriginality to get to those moments.",1438128000,9,514,4.786516853932584

6265617,1,B00IIWEU9O,"An explosion produces an avalanche which cause the legendary Stook-um snow sharks to come back and protect the mountain. With Spring Break officially in progress, the authorities don't want to make waves about missing kids. As the body count mounts, more kids go hunting Stook-um.

This is a Canadian film shot in California. The acting and dialogue were fairly lame, except for maybe the old guy. The shark is CG. We do get to see half bodies and blood.

While there are girls in bikinis in a hot tub, there is no bikini contest as claimed by the DVD description.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex or nudity. Just some Canadian attempt at cheese.",1400198400,4,646,4.699115044247788

And popping up in hot tubs to girlfriends in string bikinis. The waters run red and snow and grass too. So ""camp"" its an instant classic. I LOVED it.

6265624,2,B00IIWEU9O,"I love cheesy sci-fi, and really enjoyed ""SAND SHARKS"" so when I discovered that the same people were doing a sort of sequel I was excited. Unfortunately, this one was a major disappointment, as everyone involved seemed to be taking this way too seriously. While it was competently made, it was very generic with cookie cutter characters, and no real surprises. There are too many more entertaining shark movies out there to recommend this one.",1451692800,,444,4.933333333333334
6265625,1,B00IIWEU9O,"Buyer beware. The transfer on this DVD is horrendous, riddled with excessive combing that makes all edges/features appear jagged. Considering how recent the release is, this is far from acceptable. In fact, this should be considered a defective item that Entertainment One needs to recall. I wanted to contact the company; however, no phone numbers or e-mail address are available on their site.

Avoid this release.",1451606400,3,416,5.303030303030303

8642445,1,B00IIWEU9O,"I'm always up for a shark movie with a ridiculous premise, but ""Avalanche Sharks"" is one of the rarities that I didn't enjoy even as a campy bad movie. It's dull and slackly paced, with less likeable characters than you'd expect, rendered by actors and actresses well below the ""Sharknado"" level of competence. The film opens with a flashback of a very bad CGI shark attack on the ski slope, and then quickly shifts to this weird and hyper-annoying framing device of a psychotic and Sadistic fake nurse eliciting the story from an injured skier in a hospital. I have no idea what this little wraparound device was supposed to lend to the film, but it's quickly brushed aside for the most part.

The scene is set when a couple of idiotic snowboarders get killed straightaway, one by impalement on a branch, and the other by a snow shark. Let's just get this out of the way: the special effects are awful, and the CGI made me laugh out loud. A better title for the film might have been ""Shallow Millennials Find Death on the Slopes"" because that's essentially what happens. Beca (Haley Stewart) is the most loathsome of the bunch, and I couldn't wait to see her disappear down the gullet of any kind of creature that would be willing to eat her. She is, of course, rude and disrespectful of the nerdy guy who is driving them to the resort for spring break, and doesn't even pay attention to his story about a hyperintelligent race of sharks that flew through space to inhabit the snows of the western United States. Since it's spring break, there are plenty of skiers in bikinis and girls in hot tubs, there's a grumpy sheriff, a greedy resort owner, and his right hand man, Dale (Eric Scott Woods) who likes to sunbathe in the snow with his Olympic bronze medal on at all times. (Ponder.) Teens start disappearing from the cast as the giant snow sharks (which somehow conceal themselves under about five inches of snow) begin their rampage. I will point out that Mike's (Richard Million) death scene where he proclaims ""It's love!"" is the worst in the film and one of the worst I've ever seen in any movie of any vintage. Of course the mayor doesn't want to close the slopes (that plotpoint seems familiar for some reason...) and he makes lackey Dale the new sheriff.

The film then provides another ridiculous backstory about the sharks (the flying through space bit was apparently not enough) involving tribal wars between Native Americans and how their shaman released the sharks on oppressors. Whatever: let's just get on with it. After an interruption by the Sadistic nurse to remind us (for some reason) that that premise is still out there, there is a scene of a snow blower being shot (don't ask), and another vapid girl that I detest challenging two boys to race each other on snowmobiles with the winner getting her as a prize. Her personality is so nasty that I would have thrown the race to not have to be anywhere near her. Fortunately she is devoured quickly, a scene that could only be topped by a shark attacking girls in a hot tub, which was a movie highlight. Dale gets mauled by the sharks, but they're really smart fish, so they use him as bait to lure the others out into the snow. During that drama there is one girl who screams constantly, but is so shrill I genuinely couldn't understand most of what she said. (Not that it matters in the least.) I did like Dale's attempt at self-sacrifice, yelling at the sharks ""I'm the one you want! I got a bronze medal in the Olympics!""

The film closes enigmatically with a Japanese woman straightening ancient totems to apparently reduce shark attacks (having her unable to speak English was a convenient method of not having to explain what she was doing or why), and finally comes to a close with...I'm not kidding about this...sharks swimming under the sand on Mars. Yeah, really.

""Avalanche Sharks"" apparently wanted to be the next ""Sharknado"", but the confusing plot that wonders all over the galaxy and the off-putting characters that are wholly distasteful in combination with appalling acting make this pale in comparison to any of Fin and April's adventures.",1471478400,,4132,4.6717032967032965
