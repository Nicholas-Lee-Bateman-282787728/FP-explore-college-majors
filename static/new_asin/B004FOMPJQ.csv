It contains a nice sampling of a variety of styles and combinations from 6 top instructors, each with their own interpretive perspective.  Dondi and Katia's use of the salsa and cha cha inspired moves were fun while some of Ava's were physically challenging.  And I found one of Celeste's combinations to be the perfect fit for a choreography I am working on.  Zahra Zuhair's fluid performance at the end was not only a delight to watch but inspiring as well.",1343260800,2,535,4.659574468085107
