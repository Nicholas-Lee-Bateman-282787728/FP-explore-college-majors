1971423,5,B00014NF4I,"Sometimes the simplest things are the best !
I can recommand also the french silent movie version from henri diamant-berger(in 1921 too) that was a huge budget for this time and was lost forever before being found by chance in a private home.
No matter how thrilling and entertaining all the movie adaptations of dumas stories are, the book is still the best
That old movie is very close to the book which is a great thing
to get it, go to the french amazon (www.amazon.fr) and type les trois mousquetaires choose the one from diamant-berger",1038873600,6,541,4.645833333333333
1971424,5,B00014NF4I,"Silent movie fans will be delighted with this swashbuckling tale starring the one and only Douglas Fairbanks!  Set in France of long ago, this film uses elaborate costumes, wonderful sets and a hoard of extras.  Fairbanks IS Dartanion as he sword fights his way into the Musketeers with bavery, arrogance and that wonderful touch of humor that seems to sparkle through his films.  Spectacular stunts (done by the man himself), a wild chase scene and a supporting cast including Eugene Paulette (before he became rotund) and Adolph Menjou make this a silent screen classic everyone will enjoy! Watch out for the ""odious Cardinal!""",994032000,10,629,5.087378640776699

1971428,5,B00014NF4I,"This is undoubtedly one of the GREAT masterpieces of early cinema, or let's better say, of cinema in general. The second great swashbuckler (after 'The Mark of Zorro'), also produced by and starring the inventor and grandmaster of the whole genre, Douglas Fairbanks.
Based on the famous Dumas novel, it takes us back into 17th century France - 'when life was life, and men were men'... A story about gallantry, courage, loyalty, and of course romance, superbly directed, with authentic costumes and a magnificent set design, and the VERY best of actors; Douglas Fairbanks is simply a pleasure to behold in one of his very favorite roles as D'Artagnan, and the movie holds a most wonderful balance between the grandeur of a costume drama and the lightness of the comical elements - one of those movies that NEVER 'age'!",1416268800,,818,4.892086330935252
1971429,4,B00014NF4I,"Compared to today's film, of course this is so corny, BUT. if you're a fan of either DF, Sr. or silent movies, this is a classic in the true meaning of the word. DF, Sr's athleticism was/is legendary and he's in full form here, and great to watch.",1405468800,,247,4.166666666666667
1971430,4,B00014NF4I,"The French reviews may have been scathing enough for him to swear never to set foot in France again but Douglas Fairbanks' 1921 version of The Three Musketeers is easily one of the original King of Hollywood's most enjoyable films, with less of his scenery-chewing ham that dates so many of his films and more of the great stunts that fuelled his fame, many of which are still very impressive indeed today. The sword fights are pretty decent, but more for Fairbanks' athleticism than the fencing as he leaps over duelling swordsmen or stabs one of Richelieu's dastardly men while doing a somersault. Small wonder it was one of Fairbanks' favorite roles and one he would return to in his lavish farewell to the silent era, 1929's superb The Iron Mask.

Even though it's pre-Production Code, the story has been more than a little watered down to suit the morality of the day - the Queen here is no adulteress and the Duke of Buckingham's advances are emphatically unwanted, while Milady is a minor character who never gets to seduce D'Artagnan, let alone have her revenge - and it's more D'Artagnan than the Musketeers, a star vehicle that relegates his three companions to sidekicks for most of the film. Yet it's all great fun, the comedy playing well and Fred Niblo directing with vitality, filling the Paris street scenes with a convincing array of movement and everyday activity to disguise his comparatively limited resources (it's nowhere near as spectacular as it's infinitely superior sequel). It's decently cast too, with Adolph Menjou's King Louis and Nigel de Brulier's villainous Cardinal Richelieu making a good double-act as they try to outwit each other and Eugene Palette's Aramis making the most of his limited opportunities.

Kino's DVD is definitely the one to go for: it may not have any extras, unlike several of their other Fairbanks releases, but it's a fine transfer unlike the many public domain versions from other labels.",1292716800,2,1947,4.932926829268292
1971431,4,B00014NF4I,It is a little hokey but that is how we were back then.  It is one of the first adaptations of the novel and it is wonderful to watch.  Chas E. Moser,1273881600,,149,3.625
1971432,3,B00014NF4I,"This is the third Fairbanks movie I've seen and quite frankly this is not really that good. It pales when compared to Robin Hood and especially Thief of Bagdad. The movie is too fragmented and needs way too many textboards to keep viewers up to par with the story.

Fairbanks is fun to watch and when he's on screen he dominates. However,'presence' is not the same as acting. Fairbanks, and therefore the movie, is way too dependent on farcical comedy. At times the movie even edges dangerously close to a vaudeville act. Also his 'swashbuckling' in this movie amounts to not much more than just wildly wacking away with his sword. Maybe I saw it too soon after the hugely superior Thief of Bagdad....",1166313600,4,701,4.653225806451613
1971433,4,B00014NF4I,"While this is ultimately an enjoyable and fulfilling film, I don't think it's perhaps the most ideal first Douglas Fairbanks film for a new fan, nor an ideal first silent either.  Because it was based on a novel, naturally a lot of things were condensed or left out entirely.  This works two ways; those who have read the book and loved it will be upset that a lot of key elements were left out, and those who haven't read the book yet won't always be able to fully understand what's going on.  And since it was based on a novel, it is a bit chatty for a silent, with numerous lengthy intertitles.  Because there are so many characters, it's kind of hard to keep track of who's whom; the numerous plotlines can also be a bit hard to keep track of.  A condensed version of the rather complex plot is that the picture starts with King Louis XIII (Adolphe Menjou before he became a big star) and his wife Anne of Austria (the rather doughy-faced Mary MacLaren).  These two didn't exactly have the happiest of marriages, and I'll never forget my AP European History teacher, my sophomore year of highschool, telling us the story about how if it hadn't been for a certain thunderstorm one evening that forced the unhappily wed couple to take refuge in a cabin, there would have been no Louis XIV.  Louis XIII's scheming right-hand man Cardinal Richelieu thinks he's going to expose the affair Anne has been having with Duke Buckingham of England (George Villiers, who was notoriously sleazy, corrupt, and hated in real life, so much so he was later assassinated), but Anne is tipped off to his plan and manages to stay one step ahead of him, though it becomes hard to conceal her secret from her husband, particularly after she gives Buckingham a farewell token of a diamond buckle her husband gave her, a buckle Louis XIII later demands she wear to a ball.  Intersecting with this rather convoluted costume drama is the story of brash young D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks), who leaves home hoping to become a member of the legendary Musketeers, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis.  D'Artagnan is very hot-headed, willing to fight and duel at the drop of a hat, and makes himself several enemies before he even gets to Paris.  D'Artagnan wins the respect and friendship of the Musketeers and is allowed to fight alongside them.  While he is living in Paris, he falls in love with Constance, his innkeeper's pretty daughter (Marguerite de la Motte, his leading lady in a number of his early films).  The two main plots intersect when the Queen has D'Artagnan and the Musketeers dispatched to go to England to get back her diamond buckle in time for the ball, so that her honor will not be besmirched.  This final part of the movie is the most action-packed, suspenseful, and compelling.

Douglas Fairbanks was best at swashbuckling, action, and adventure, and there's enough of it to go around here, even when he's in period costume and held back from completely taking center stage due to all of the other characters.  (And when he is onscreen, he's constantly in motion and stealing the scene.)  Although a lot of character development and themes from the book had to be left out, one doesn't usually watch Doug's movies for things like those.  One watches his movies for exciting action and adventure; things like character development and deep meaningful themes are secondary concerns.  He might not have been a *great* actor necessarily, but he did have an incredible amount of charm, charisma, personality, and screen presence to make up for it.  However, as good as the film is, it's not really the most ideal introduction to Fairbanks, what with all of the twists and turns in the story, all of the different plots and characters to keep track of, and the fact that it's quite chatty, which usually doesn't work for a silent.  And coupled with those reasons, I've just never been very interested in 17th century history (actually I find that era kind of boring), which is when this takes place.",1165104000,2,3987,4.725829725829726
1971434,5,B00014NF4I,"This is where it all started:  right after his first successful action adventure, ""The Mark of Zorro"", Douglas Fairbanks decided that the  classic Dumas novel about musketeers and intrigues at the French royal court would make another exciting swashbuckling adventure, and he was right!  With all the countless remakes of ""The Three Musketeers"" over the decades, it's well worth going right back to the first version that started it all.  In the silent era, emphasis was often put on the visual aspects such as sets, action and acting, and Fairbanks had a most expressive style of pantomime - the ancient art of acting using gestures and body language, similar to mime.  Fairbanks was also an exceptional athlete who did his own stunts and action sequences, even learning to fence for his roles as Zorro and then D'Artagnan, which led to further successful action costume adventures, including the sequel to ""The Three Musketeers"" namely ""The Iron Mask"".  It was these 1920s classic adventure films by Fairbanks that set the stage for Hollywood action heroes and adventure movies right up to our day.  With his exuberant and dynamic style, as well as attention to historic details, these groundbreaking films were among the most successful of the decade. Put all these elements together and you have a thrilling action-packed adventure with quite a complex plot that builds in suspense to an exciting climax.  There are electrifying sword fights and impressive athletics by Fairbanks, interesting characters like the power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu who devises various schemes to undermine the Queen.  This becomes a quest for D'Artagnan and the three musketeers who gladly risk their lives for the Glory of France and the Queen's honour.  ""The Three Musketeers"" is a perfect balance of romance, humour, action, excitement and fun.  For anyone who enjoys classic movies and stories, you can't pass ""The Three Musketeers"", and needless to say, it belongs in any good silent film collection as well.",1114560000,4,1997,5.190031152647975
8006562,4,B00014NF4I,"This review is for the 2016 Undercrank Productions DVD of The Three Musketeers (1921) starring Douglas Fairbanks.

My review cannot be a comparative one, because I have not watched this film in any other edition.  (There is a KINO edition of the film, and generally KINO does a good job on silent films, but I can't speak for it, because The Three Musketeers is one KINO that I *don't* have.)

This edition contains the entire film: the running time is just shy of two hours, at 1:19+ minutes.

The image is almost always clear throughout, sometimes quite vivid, and for a film so old, it's more than acceptable, and quite enjoyable to watch.  The few weak spots seem to be where one scene fades out and another comes in, but those last only a second or less.  The only other noticeable flaw was a very thin vertical line (quite common in very old films) visible early in the film.  I don't know how long it lasted, because I became so absorbed in the story I didn't take note of when it vanished, but I think it was visible only for a minute or two.  In any case, it wasn't very obtrusive.

This version has tinted scenes.  I don't know whether these tints are from original negatives, or had to be put in with modern technology, but they look much like the tinting on many of my other silent DVDs, and hence seem authentic for the period.  They use blue for night scenes, orangey-brown for most of the other scenes, though occasionally a fleshy-pinky-brown tone is used (apparently for contrast with the orangey-brown, e.g., at one point there is some back-and-forth switching between the palace office of the villains and the place where the heroes are, and the different tinting seems to be to help the viewer recognize the scene shift).

The musical score is good, with appropriate musical shifts to match what is happening in the story.  It sounds like a theater organ, but the credits seem to indicate that it is some sort of simulated theater organ using a computer program to duplicate organ sounds.  If so, the simulation is pretty good.

As for the movie, it has a standard Three Musketeers plot, with Fairbanks and friends trying to help the Queen of France against the schemes of the power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu.  (I can't comment on how far it departs from the plot of the Dumas novel or from later versions.)  The plot moves along at a good pace, with few wasted moments.  The set design is quite good, as are the costumes.  The acting is good, too.  Of course, you have to like silent movies; if you don't, you will probably find the acting style too old-fashioned.  But if you are already a silent movie fan, you are used to adjusting to silent screen acting, and will have no problem with this one.  Fairbanks as D'Artagnan is good, with his usual high-energy performance.  (I think he is better in later films, but he is still good here.)  Nigel De Brulier is a great villain, and the actresses with lead roles (two good, one villainous) are all good as well.  How could anyone not fall in love with Marguerite De La Motte's Constance?  The actresses in those days could project a sweetness and purity that just is not found on the screen these days.  The Musketeers (you have to look hard to recognize Eugene Pallette as Aramis) look good in swordfights, and are reasonably convincing in their parts (though they aren't given the characterization that D'Artagnan is, and therefore are less memorable).  The actor who plays Porthos is probably my favorite.  If there is anything to complain about in the film, it is that there is less splashy Fairbanks action than in most of his other films.

I am not sure where to rank this among Fairbanks films.  I don't think it is as good as the sequel, Iron Mask (1929), which is available in a good KINO edition.  I don't think it is as good as Thief of Bagdad (1924), either.  It might be equal to Robin Hood or the Zorro films.  I would have to watch them all again to make a comparison.  But it is very entertaining.  The IMDb fans give it only 7.0 out of 10, but I think that's a little stingy.

This DVD has an adequate scene menu (not animated), with the stops being about 4.5 minutes apart.  There are no other special features, not even a trailer.  I see no menu choice for subtitles in other languages.  (You don't need subtitles in English, because it's a silent film and the intertitles are quite large and easy to read.)

The price on this item is currently $19.95, which is very good for a restored silent film with a good new soundtrack.

I give this edition 4 stars; to get 5 stars it would need some extra features.  Still, I can recommend it for those who enjoy historical/swashbuckler films and silent films.",1508371200,,4691,4.547732696897374

It's interesting that Silent movies actually took a moment to take a look at each character, giving you an intimate introduction to their personalities with facial expressions and actions.
