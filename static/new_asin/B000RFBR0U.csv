8331255,5,B000RFBR0U,"If you are like myself and enjoy seeing large steam locomotives working hard this is a film you will watch over and over. To add to the viewing pleasure many of the trains are worked through scenery of almost picture post-card beauty in the mountains and coastline of California. A great variety of types of locomotives from large freight types, through streamlined express engines to yard locomotives are featured working all sorts of goods and passenger trains as well as yard and station scenes.

The ferry boats between Oakland and San Francisco are also fascinating. If you are wondering whether or not to buy a US steam film, or which one to buy, this is the best place to start. The speeding loco followed from the road in the second feature is one of the most exciting bits of rail film I have ever seen",1278288000,,811,4.593103448275862
