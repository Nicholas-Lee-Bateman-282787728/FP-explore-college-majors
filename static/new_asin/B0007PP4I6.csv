8050373,5,B0007PP4I6,"The word ""wrestling"" doesn't do this justice. I've been a student of Dr. Yang in Boston for almost 4 years. This tape shows taiji takedown techniques from various form postures starting from the crossed push hands position. It's like taking a master class or seminar with the Master himself. Highly recommended.",1171843200,,311,5.117647058823529
8050374,5,B0007PP4I6,"Great video, which shows dozens of takedown techniques hidden in Tai Chi forms and Pushing Hands. These easy takedowns are very clever and practical, and can probably be used no matter what style you train.

There are 2 VHS courses in total.",1120089600,,241,4.738095238095238
