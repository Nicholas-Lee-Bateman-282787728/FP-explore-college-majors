1393647,5,B000055WI7,was received by daughter as gift on time but they did not watch it yet that I know of.  They arre overseas.,1356739200,,107,3.8636363636363638
1393648,2,B000055WI7,"play time: 22 min. The angel choir master and Cherub Wings retell the story of the first Christmas and the gift of the Savior to the world. Lots of songs (""Come and See Jesus,"" ""All Must Draw Near""), some familiar (a samba version of ""Friendly Beasts""). 3-D and 2-D animation, plus some live action. Cherub is precocious and conversational in a kid-friendly way, explains the story of Christmas easily and thoroughly (and biblically). Sometimes cheesy, but probably good for younger kids. The show culminates with the angels singing ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas."" Suggested age: 3-7 (I would have gone 3-6) Feels like a children's TV special you'd see very early on a Saturday morning on the Baby Einstein channel.",1256860800,,716,4.925619834710743
1393649,5,B000055WI7,"This is the most beautiful depiction of the story of baby Jesus.  The songs are pretty, the animation is adorable.  My kids love it and watch it over and over, regardless of the time of year.  They have a great understanding of the real Christmas Story.  I highly recommend every parent purchase this!",1250985600,,301,4.622641509433962

1393651,5,B000055WI7,"This looks like a kiddie production. But don't be fooled. Its a fantastic series. The animation is highly spectacular and the music videos are well done. I first saw it on EWTN and since then, I've ordered the entire series of Cherub Wings. But this one, the Angel Song is my favourite. I enjoyed the songs so much that I recorded the soundtrack on my MD player so I can replay the music anytime. This version is based on the Christmas Theme. So it makes a great gift for your dear ones. By the way, I,m 31 years old! and havnt enjoyed such ""kiddie"" productions like this before.",1009152000,3,579,4.37037037037037

7930993,1,B000055WI7,"All money from these products goes to the Children of God cult, now known as the Family International. This cult was founded by David Berg, a known pedophile, and since his death has been run by his wife Karen Zerby, another pedophile. The Family has always been defined by its horrific child abuse and forced child labor, as myself and thousands of other survivors who were born into this group can attest to. Don't support cults or child abuse. Do not buy these videos.",1457222400,,471,4.619047619047619
7930994,1,B000055WI7,"Created by a pseudo christian sex cult. It has seemingly good morals and simple storylines but there are so many better series that don't support groups like this and introduce your children to their teachings.
Here's some info about the group it came from: [...]",1457222400,,263,4.866666666666666
7930995,1,B000055WI7,"This product is directly linked to the cult THE FAMILY INTERNATIONAL / THE CHILDREN OF GOD, known as the sex cult, who for years preached sex with children and who promoted bizarre religious doctrines. The proceeds of this CHERUB WINGS, linked with Sunny Side Up productions and Aurora Productions go directly to support cult leaders. The producers of Cherub Wings have no legal association with the cult purposely so that they can continue to profit without any legations and connections to past and present crimes.",1456704000,,516,5.08235294117647
7930996,1,B000055WI7,"While these movies and books appeal to contain good Christian moral values the fact of the matter is they are made to support the leaders of the cult formerly known as the Children of God, that changed their name to The Family International. Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1456704000,,592,4.647619047619048
7930997,1,B000055WI7,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product it supports well documented pedophiles.",1456704000,,814,4.9416058394160585
