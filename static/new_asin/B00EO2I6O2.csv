5929570,5,B00EO2I6O2,"Unlike others who reviewed this, I DID find out a lot about Ricky Jay from this. True, you have to read between the lines & ""treasure hunt"" to get to it, but it made it that much more fun. Yes, there is more about his mentors than about him TECHNICALLY. But, these are the men who shaped him into what he is today, so if you truly can use your brain & common sense { traits sadly not in play much in people in these days of the ""push a button & there it is"" way of thinking }, you will find you feel like you know Ricky personally. I have idolized this man since I first saw him on tv on the late great Doug Henning's first magic special in the 1970's, & have idolized him ever since. Thanks to the folks responsible for this wonderful documentary on this amazing human being. BRAVO!!!!",1386806400,3,786,4.1103896103896105
5929571,2,B00EO2I6O2,"He is a great magician, but this is boring film. You can barely see many of the tricks and the movie does much more ""tell"" than ""show"".  It is strictly for Jay fanatics, as it is far too slow, narrow and trivial for even people like me who love great magicians.",1386633600,,261,4.117647058823529
5929572,3,B00EO2I6O2,"I admire Ricky Jay tremendously, first as a historian of magic and peculiar performance, secondly as perhaps the greatest living slight-of-hand artist, with an emphasis on card manipulation. I've never had the opportunity to see Jay live, so I appreciated the clips from his performances and interviews in this film. ""Deceptive Practice"", directed and edited by Molly Bernstein, takes its title from Ricky Jay's magic consulting business Deceptive Practices, Inc. The narration by Dick Cavett takes us through Jay's career in magic and scholarship, including commentary and history by Jay on the mentors of his youth and early career. Some of Jay's friends and colleagues are also interviewed, including playwright David Mamet, business partner Michael Weber, and manager Winston Simone.

""Deceptive Practice"" begins with the career of 7-year-old Ricky Potash and the great influence of his grandfather, amateur magician Max Katz. Ricky Jay fondly recalls his grandfather and his grandfather's friends, accomplished magicians of the day who were the basis of his education in magic: ""Cardini"" or Richard Valentine Pitchford, Francis Carlyle, Tony Slydini, Al Flosso, who sparked Jay's interest in the history of magic, and Roy Benson. Jay also has a lot to say about Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller, to whom he was effectively apprenticed after Jay's career was well underway and he had achieved some notoriety from television appearances. All of this information about these great artists is wonderful, but there is a good deal less about Ricky Jay than about other people.

Through interviews with friends, we get a couple of insights into Jay's personality and some great stories that demonstrate his wry sense of humor and extraordinary slight of hand. But the insight into Jay's character is limited. ""Deceptive Practices"" doesn't have a clear purpose or point of view. It doesn't analyze Ricky Jay's career and professional contributions, which would be one approach. It isn't a character study. That would be difficult considering Ricky Jay's tendency toward secrecy. Jay is an engaging speaker and writer but reveals very little of himself beyond what you can glean from what he has not said. Nor is the film advancing any particular point of view. If it had a point to make about Jay or about magic or about deception, it could get away with a narrow focus. Unfortunately, ""Deceptive Practice"" is scattershot in spite of its interesting subjects.

The DVD (Kino Lorber 2013): Much of the bonus material is effectively deleted scenes, interviews and clips that didn't make the final cut of the film. ""Jay's Colleagues on Camera"" (20 min) are interviews with Paul Thomas Anderson, Heather Graham, David Mamet, and Mark Singer about Jay, and there is a clip from an old TV show with Steve Martin and Ricky Jay. ""Ricky Jay and Michael Weber on Mentors and Magic"" (15 min) are more interviews with those 2 men about their recollections of Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller. ""Never-Before-Seen Performance Footage and Crazy Anecdotes"" (29 min) are clips from performances, interviews, and lectures. ""Ricky Jay and Mark Singer at The New Yorker Festival"" (47 min) is a talk with Jay and Singer at The Friar's Club from about 10 years ago. ""Unseen Animation"" (1 min) is animation by Lisa Daly using Jay's book covers. ""Promo for Bob Dylan's Love and Theft"" (1 min) is an ad featuring Dylan and Ricky Jay. There is a theatrical trailer (2  min). The profile that Mark Singer did of Jay for The New Yorker in 1993 is available for download on the disc, or you can download it at Ricky Jay's web site. No subtitles for the film.",1385164800,11,3620,5.058626465661642
5929573,5,B00EO2I6O2,"The movie is entertaining, informative, and well made. The stories about Ricky's mentors were fascinating, and he was amazing and funny. I especially liked the runny nose trick he did with Ed Sullivan.  There are copious bonus features on the DVD, including a performance by Flydini (Steve Martin).",1384041600,7,298,5.208333333333333
5929574,5,B00EO2I6O2,"This is a great magician who shows us his influences that were great magicians. Mr. J is the greatest sleight-of-hand magician in the world , and his writings are just as great, Highly recommended, A must-have!",1383955200,,210,4.861111111111111
5929575,5,B00EO2I6O2,"This is worth getting just for the clips of Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller.  Add to that the incredible stories by those who have had their lives changed (yes, really) by one of Mr. Jay's tricks and you have a great film.  But wait, there's more . . . film of Jay performing on TV as a small child before he was Ricky Jay, backstage work between he and Michael Weber, insight into the ""rules"" that Mr. Jay has about those who would desire to be his conversation partners.
Truly a fascinating film about a fascinating character.  The director has promised lots of ""extras"" on the DVD and I can't wait to see them.
If you are a magician, a lover of magic history, or just a fan of Mr. Jay, this is a must have.",1381622400,16,707,4.1838235294117645
5929578,5,B00EO2I6O2,"The life of a genuine master, and a beautiful documentary to boot.  Recommended for anyone interested in art, what it is, and how powerful it can be.",1435017600,,149,4.518518518518518

5929581,5,B00EO2I6O2,"I'm the same age as Ricky Jay and a fellow magician. I am familiar with the greats in magic history and I studied with some of the people mentioned. If you are a lay person, you may want to go on line and study for yourself who these people are and their significance in the history of magic to get the full impact of what is being said here. .",1425600000,,344,3.9285714285714284
5929582,5,B00EO2I6O2,"An excellent coverage of close-up magic. This DVD does not reveal any secrets but does give pointers on how to learn magic for yourself. Jay says that repetition when practicing with a deck of cards is good. But a better way is analyzing and trying to improve each move every time you repeat the move. Will you like the movie? I'd suggest that you read the online information on Ricky Jay then ask yourself if you want to learn more about him and also watch him ply his trade. The hour and a half movie contains lots of really good close-up magic performed by Jay as well as many antidotes. Dai Vernon's (""The Professor's"") contribution to close-up card magic is praised by Jay along with other close-up magicians that influenced his trip through the weird world of a magic. The movie is divided into 10 scenes indexed with scene titles. There are four documentaries that combined last longer than the feature and sometime repeats and other times adds to the influence that Ricky Jay has had on this particular art form. Also, there's a Bob Dylan video that Jay's in, unused animation, and a theatrical trailer. From one magician to another, this DVD is highly recommended.",1425513600,,1173,4.699029126213592
5929583,5,B00EO2I6O2,"If you are interested in autobiographies of performing magicians, Ricky Jay's book is excellent.  Further proof that persistence pays off.",1424908800,,138,5.9

5929601,5,B00EO2I6O2,"I had seen Ricky Jay in films (most notably in House of Games).  I didn't realize he had such a following and was doing public performances.

The film itself is well done, scripted, and directed.  Not a dull movement.",1391212800,5,217,4.512820512820513

5929603,5,B00EO2I6O2,I loved this movie.  I watched it with a friend and she loved it and wanted a copy of it.  The movie is intriguing and wonderfully done.,1390089600,2,136,4.0
5929604,4,B00EO2I6O2,"A glass one-third empty, two-thirds full kind of film. One-third that is rich and brimming is the wonderful introduction to the various
colorful artists who mentored Ricky Jay into arguably the foremost card magician of our time. It's a lineage we learn that is handed down very personally, from generation to generation and then only in bits and pieces. Jay tells great stories of the men who inspired and tutored him. And we occasionally see terrific glimpses of them performing in some great found old footage.

The second full third are the wonderful, if all too brief times we to watch Jay's amazing artistry with cards and card tricks. Slight of hand at this level is truly beautiful -- a dance of illusion. There's a silky smoothness to Jay's movements that works in powerful tandem with this spikey, off-beat, almost dangerous on stage persona.

The third that's missing is a deeper exploration of the man himself. By his own admission Jay keeps the world at bay. We hear a very few tantalizing bits about his boyhood family life away from magic, but then that's put aside (even his manager of 20+ years admits he knows better than to ask Ricky about his childhood). Only near the very end of the film do we even learn that Jay is married, and that his wife seems to be a huge part of his life. Then this too is moved on from. I can accept that Jay and perhaps director Molly Bernstein wanted to keep the film focused largely on Jay's titular mentors, but, for my taste, they took the `mysteries' part of the title a bit too seriously. It's frustrating to watch a truly striking human being talk about their life and craft for 90 minutes, and realize you know little more about them at the end than at the beginning. It leaves a very entertaining and well made film feeling a touch incomplete.

That said, this is still very worth seeing. I was never bored, sometimes astonished by what I saw, and heard amazing stories I don't think I'll soon forget.",1388102400,7,1959,4.591428571428572
5929605,5,B00EO2I6O2,"So much Bonus Material it's taken me two days to try and finish this new Ricky Jay DVD, Deceptive Practices.  This was a Christmas present to myself, and I just couldn't wait until then to watch it.  I paid full retail from my magic dealer and after finishing it I feel like I owe the guy more money.  This is the Ricky Jay tape I've waited 40 years for.  Everything I ever wanted to know about this mysterious character has surfaced here, and oh so much more.

Richy Jay is a master card mechanic, magician, writer and raconteur.  His books are among my most prized possessions.  His first book, Cards as Weapons is so valuable, if you owned a first edition you could probably use it to make a down payment on a mansion (I own 3 copies).  Ricky's historical writings on odd and whimsical characters often make their way into his lectures and demonstrations of his skill with cards that borders on the paranormal.

I could wax on about Ricky Jay, but I'll let this new DVD do it for me.  If this is your first contact with him, perhaps you should go over to Youtube and run his name through the site to familiarize yourself with his talents.  It's about the only place you can find his Off Broadway Show turned  HBO special, 'Ricky Jay & His 52 Assistants'.  You can watch parts of it anyway, this is one HBO refuses to release and bootleg copies aren't cheap.

Ricky Jay's Deceptive Practices is wonderful, buy two copies, one for yourself and another to sell in the future on e-Bay.",1387929600,,1484,4.428044280442805
