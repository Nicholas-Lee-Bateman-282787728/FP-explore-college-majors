8584925,2,B00CQ8L9T0,strictly for beginners.  somewhat boring and not much of a workout for intermediate/advanced exercisers.  had to return it after one use.,1445990400,2,137,5.476190476190476

8584927,4,B00CQ8L9T0,"Pretty good video. I like her style, it is not overly happy and upbeat. She is fairly straight forward. I would recommend that you have some experience/knowledge about cardio/weight training. It is a quick workout that can be done in the morning before work or school.",1433635200,4,268,4.8478260869565215

8584931,5,B00CQ8L9T0,Nice DVD for days when one wants to get a workout that is not to easy but also not to challenging. Caroline Pearce is also very motivating.,1407628800,3,139,4.185185185185185
8584932,5,B00CQ8L9T0,"I like this DVD, it is perfect for my type of workout. I like interval training and this DVD has it. The moves are simple & effective, and vary about every 30 seconds or so. Although multiple moves are incorporated into the exercises, they are not cumbersome at all. They are easy to follow. My sides were sore the next day. I enjoy her moves, as there are a few different ones I haven't tried before. It keeps me interested and motivated.  There is a warm up (approx. 5 mins) Level 1 is 21 mins, and a cool down which is just over 6 minutes. A good solid 1/2 hour and I feel it. There is also a Level 2 & Level 3 (which are approx. 16 & 17 mins). Her voice is calm and motivating, the background is serene. I will definitely keep this DVD in my rotation.",1403481600,5,755,4.067114093959732
8584933,5,B00CQ8L9T0,"I consider myself at an intermediate to advanced level of fitness.

Overall I felt I got a good workout from this DVD.  The moves were simple and changed enough that I was not bored.  I usually find voiceovers weird but instructor's voice was non-annoying and did not detract.  The music was decent and had a beat to follow.  I felt like there was a bit too much repetition sometimes with the words of encouragement but I feel that way about a lot of exercise videos.  In the end, even ""good job"" or ""beautiful"" or any number of encouraging expressions start to grate after hearing them again and again and again (especially when a routine is good enough to play again and again and again you wish they had just stuck to counting.)",1378598400,5,731,4.5
8584934,5,B00CQ8L9T0,"This DVD is challenging but pure joy to follow along with. Caroline is a friendly, encouraging (and impressively athletic!) instructor who cues very clearly. Using this DVD and just a pair of light weights you can really work towards reaching your fitness goals. And no yelling here, I'm happy to say. ;-)

Shot on a vividly blue-skied desert are 3 workouts that progress from (almost) simple to quite advanced. Yet each is short (20 minutes or less) and each exercise lasts only 30 seconds or so, so even high beginners can follow along the best they can. If you are familiar with a basic repertoire of exercises you can always sub an easier move for one that's temporarily too challenging. The exercises themselves are basic and easy to follow - nothing tricky or twisty, just the proven basics, done to a rapid tempo with light weights. But remember, since the workouts are done to time rather than number of reps you can - and should - go at your own pace. I recommend searching for this title on the internet and you will find several clips so you can judge for yourself if this is something that would suit you.",1374883200,11,1117,4.585
