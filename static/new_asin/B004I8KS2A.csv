8430245,5,B004I8KS2A,"The words ''bleak'', ''raw'', ''brutal'' or ''merciless'' do not do justice to this little-known and underrated Danish gem, directed by Tobias Lindholm and Michael Noer and starring one of the best Scandinavian actors today, Pilou Asbk. The film opens with our protagonist, named Rune (hence the ''R'' of the title), sitting in a prison transport van heading to the notorious Horsens prison, where he is put to most hardcore ward populated by the country's worst thugs. Rune is intelligent and strives in order to survive the tough prison life, while he hatches a plan of an efficient way to deliver the drugs inside the prison. Because of that, Rune is slowly beginning to climb the ladder in the native (Danish) gang of inmates, but unfortunately for our hero, his future is not at all bright and after a betrayal from people he shouldn't trust finds himself in the worst position that an inmate can be, thus owing the big boys a lot of money. This is one of the most horrid and grim prison films ever made and the ominous atmosphere which permeates the confined space of Horsens prisons, which was a real prison till 2006 and now is a museum, is ever-present. The movie is at times hard to watch, not because of gory scenes, but because of the realistic (physical and psychological) portrayal of violence. The actors do a truly terrific job, and along with Asbk, Roland Mller and Dulfi Al-Jabouri deliver strong performances. The ending scene was one of the most shocking, I've ever seen in a film and acts as the most appropriate finale to a dark and disturbing story. This is a movie not recommended for those faint at heart, but it is also an unforgettable cinematic experience.",1526774400,,1684,4.750853242320819
8430246,2,B004I8KS2A,"Boring.  I worked in the prison system for 18 months (in the US) and saw what prison life is really like.  This film shows only a small glimpse of prison life and I would venture to say that countries overseas probably have worse conditions than depicted in this movie.  They only hint at the way prison life really is like.  I'm sure the prisons over there are as overcrowded as ours, yet this prison had very few prisoners.  They didn't have the cable TV or central air, but they did have more private cells it seemed.  I was very disappointed by what the cover conveyed and how the movie didn't seem to match the reviews.",1516924800,,624,4.3826086956521735
8430247,5,B004I8KS2A,"R is an extremely unpleasant and volatile experience, and I mean that in the best way possible. I knew that things would eventually turn sour for the main character, but I could have never predicted how far they would go. If you're looking for an uplifting prison drama in the vein of The Shawshank Redemption, look somewhere else. But as an emotional and brutally honest experience, the film succeeds brilliantly",1407110400,3,413,4.914285714285715
8430248,5,B004I8KS2A,"A young man with an initial ""R"" with unspecified crime was sent to one of Denmark's toughest prisons of hardened criminals
where he must find ways to survive during a bleak winter.
This is another fine Danish film and one of the most realistic and engrossing prison films to date and with an unusual ending.
It shows that prison is a society where everyone must continue to do bad things in order to survive, including the guards.
It is a tough, grim and intense film with fine acting, cinematography and music.
Highly recommended for those who love tough prison films.",1357776000,,569,4.7
8430249,5,B004I8KS2A,This is a nasty film that portrays the dark inner recesses of the human existence behind the walls of Denmark's former notorious maximum security prison. Everything shown here reduces humanity to the vicious instinctual level of dog-eat-dog world where nobody but the very lucky survive. I found this movie to be a fascinating study on a number of levels: its use of ex-cons as actors; its portrayal of how the prison hierarchy works; the culture of corruption that pervades every corner of the prison; the different monikers like 'Rune' and 'Albanian' that various inmates adopted to established their reputation; and the many psychological cat-and-mouse games being played out between predator and prey. This film is so caught up in describing the terrifying realities of prison life that it does not need a Hollywood-style plot to reinforce. Actions definitely speak louder than words in this modern Dostoevskian depiction of human depravity in its most hopeless state.,1332806400,4,972,5.27741935483871
8430250,5,B004I8KS2A,"I was looking for a good foreign movie in the foreign movie section of my local public library and fell upon this movie. I must admit that I didn't know much about this movie going in, I just read a couple of the plot lines that appear on the back of teh DVD case, and that was enough for me to pick this u[. Am I glad I did.

""R"" (originally released in 2010 in Denmark; 99 min.) brings the story of a prisoner referred to as ""R"", who is brought into the toughest prison in Denmark (for an unspecified but what one assumes is a hardcore crime). In the wing of the prison where he is placed, he is on his own without allies and quickly discovers that he at the bottom of the pecking order. The movie for a while is ""survivor 101 in a tough prison"", and the undertone of the movie in gritty and intense throughout. Then one day luck smiles on R as he discovers a new way to circulate drugs from one wing of the prison to another. Now life gets better (and a little easier), but if you think we're heading for a Hollywood-type happy ending, not so fast! The last 20 min. of the movie are nothing short of amazing.

In all, it's been a while that I have seen a movie this intense, where I was literally on the edge of my couch for much of the movie. Outstainding performaces throughout, none more so than Pilou Asbaek as R. My thanks to Olive Films for releasing the movie on the US market. Highly recommended!",1323907200,3,1407,4.1501831501831505
8430251,5,B004I8KS2A,"An IMDB reviewer chose ""raw"" amongst other adjectives to describe this Danish prison movie and that is just a start for it's the most disturbingly realistic prison movie I've ever seen. Excellent role playing on all parts from prisoners to security. Little is censured so be prepared and what makes the script and directing even better is that although the threats and violence are omnipresent it's not presented in an overboard sensationalist movie manner but as coldly and matter-of-factly as one would expect.",1320278400,5,512,5.180722891566265
