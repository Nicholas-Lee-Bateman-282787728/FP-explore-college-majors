8111261,3,B000EMGJ54,"Riot, 1997 film

This is a Hollywood drama of the 1992 Watts riot in Los Angeles. It lasted five days and cost over fifty lives, the result of the not guilty verdict over the Rodney King beating. [Popular protest is not a new event; it goes back to the Shays Rebellion in the 1780's.] Note the seething anger among the young men. Does it say anything about the culture and conditions there? Two young men shop at a large store then see the news on television. People on the street attack cars and people! Rocks are thrown at cars. People take what they want from stores without paying. Shopping frenzy? Dont burn my store! pleads one owner (of Asian descent). The more oppressed the people, the wilder their celebrations wrote an Englishman who traveled throughout Europe in the early 19th century.

High rates of unemployment are a cause of poverty and anger. A young woman tries a joke on her boyfriend. Whats going on over there? People break into stores and grab merchandise. Where are the police? Or the owners? People shatter glass windows to access the merchandise. One young man takes a pistol, he can sell it for cash. Creative shopping? People justify their thefts. Ive never seen anything like this in my life! There are conflicts among people. One man is shot by a store owner, his friend destroys property in the store. A fire is set in a store. A young policeman comments on the Rodney King incident. Other policemen also comment on this event. Are they trained for emergencies? The verdict affects people according to race.

Some people may not be happy. A man is arrested for vandalism, a crowd gathers in protest. A policeman fires shots to disperse the crowd. Fire bombs are thrown! [One reason why they don't make glass bottles anymore?] A young couple rejoice over their unborn child. The husband drives to a store. People in a barber shop talk about the verdict. Outside a crowd attacks a man in a car (in revenge). The business closes early. A liquor store owner will stay, he has a shotgun. He survived the 1965 riot. [Will his luck run out?] A policeman is surrounded by a crowd, he fires his pistol. But stores are set on fire and burn. Will insurance policies cover the damage from a riot?

This movie shows the problems but not the solution. What has changed over the last twenty-four years? Can peace and love solve the problems or racism? Not if it one-sided. The problem is human nature: most people are never happy unless they can look down on others. If its not racial differences its something else: the rich against the poor, the urban against the rural, employers against the employees, and so on. Even one neighborhood against another. Think of local high school sports teams against a neighboring town. Does a Ruling Class encourage this? Divide et impera is an old saying.",1462060800,,2810,4.670707070707071

The fact that they were able to incorporate the 4 stories with actual live footage of Watts/Rodney King 92 situation was out of this world.  The cast members were great.  I especially liked the fact that this movie was thorough.  It gave you the feeling from everyone who suffered in the melee, the Asians/blacks/policemen/Latinos.
Beautifully done with seasoned actors made it all the more better.
Let's hope and pray that this is the last time we ever have to see dark days like this, but to have this on film as a reminder is a great move.",1401235200,,740,4.6106870229007635

8111265,5,B000EMGJ54,"If there is any doubt that Luke Perry's acting abilities can extend beyond 90210, this film dispels them all.
In the tradition of Nancy Savoca's ""If These Walls Could Talk"" this film explores the reactions of four individuals during the Los Angeles riots.
Perry appears in one of the vingettes as the cop who begins to understand racial problems and questions his fellow officer's handling of the sittuation, coming to the conclusion that there were serious problems within the culture of the LAPD itself that were far more destructive than whatever lurked outside. This is far beyond teen-targeteted melodrama.
Even if the Los Angeles riots have become a historic marker for many, for residents living inside the 'rough' areas of he city, it is easy to see why the issues in this film have personal staying power. The excellent directing and casting make it clear (where it is not spoken) this country still has a good way to go before true racial justice is created.
Unlike so many of the histo-drama's created today (titanic) this film does a great job presenting the grittiness of the sittuation. Although America pride's itself on freedom and justice, it has not fully come to grips with the impacts of its past misdeeds. I shudder to think how saccahrine and hollow the impact would be if the film had been produced by James Cameron and/or released by a big studio because the plot would have had all of the rough edges taken out to the detriment of cinema quality.
Despite some gloss (yes, even independent films contribute some licence!)this is a very enjoyable fim and would be a wonderful addition to anybody's video collection. It's well worth the time and money to add this title.",976406400,10,1692,4.837931034482758
