1832075,4,B000089QAJ,"this video isn't for those who aren't already somewhat familiar with pilates....it's hard to follow at first if you don't know the basic pilates moves.

other than that, i thought it was a great video. it always leaves my sweating and it goes by really fast because of the timer on the bottom. keli's encouraging and helpful, but not over-ethusiastic. i hate cheerleader-like trainers. i've only been doing it for about a month and i'm seeing some great results.",1127174400,3,462,4.848101265822785
1832076,1,B000089QAJ,"1) 10 minutes is just not enough time to get a meaningful workout, especially one like Pilates.

2) Definitely NOT for beginners, especially when she throws in more advanced moves (such as the Teaser) without even mentioning that they're not for beginners. Newbies can get discouraged if they don't realize that tougher moves are being randomly thrown at them.

3) The instructor is annoying.",1091145600,17,392,5.109375
1832077,5,B000089QAJ,"Quick Fix Pilates Abs is an excellent exercise video for targeting not only your abdominal area, but also your entire midsection, or ""core.""  The tape consists of three 10-minute ab programs which become progressively more difficult.  Instructor Keli Roberts jumps right into the workout, offering good form pointers but not much detailed instruction.  Therefore, prior familiarity with Pilates is a must for this workout, especially given that there are several challenging, intermediate/advanced level Pilates moves included (some modifications are shown).
Program 1 contains a classic Pilates matwork sequence, although the exercises are not performed in the traditional order.  Keli alternates more accessible, beginner's level Pilates moves such as leg circles and the hundred with more challenging moves such as the shoulder bridge, the rollover, and modified teasers.  In Program 2, there is a greater focus on obliques, beginning with the can-can and then moving through most of the exercises in the Pilates ""stomach series,"" including single and double leg stretch, scissors, and criss-cross.  This program also includes moves to work your back such as swimming and back extensions.  The third program is the toughest by far, and it includes some quite challenging moves.  This section begins with two sets of push-up and then continues with plank work both from a push-up position and from an elbows down position.  This is also the only section which includes exercises from the Pilates side kicks series; these exercises really work not only your abdominals, but also your outer thigh/hip area.
It's important to note that there are no warmups/cool-downs included in this workout:  each program is a full 10 minutes of intense toning work.  This would be a very good video for anyone who enjoys Pilates and wants to some very different, concentrated Pilates routines.",1084752000,23,1879,5.4006849315068495
1832078,4,B000089QAJ,"First of all, I really think this workout should be called ""Pilates Core"" rather than ""Pilates Abs"", because that is exactly what it is.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great workout, and you can get an excellent intermediate ab workout if you just do the last 5 minutes of workout 1 and the first 6 minutes of workout 2.  The rest of the DVD seems to focus on core rather than just abs.  There are three 10 minute workouts.  Workout #1 is called Classical Pilates.  This workout begins with some slow crunch type exercises, but then it goes into several minutes of single leg circles and some bridge type exercises.  The last 5 minutes offer great exercises for the abs: hundreds with legs bent or out to 45%, criss-crossing leg lowers, and teasers.  Workout #2 is called Core Combination.  The first 6 minutes contains some more great ab work: crunches (halfway down, all the way up), roll downs, single and double leg stretch, scissors, and slow moving bicycle type exercise.  After 6 minutes, you begin to work your back, glutes, and hamstrings with the swimmer.  Then you do some cat back arches and some balancing table top exercises where you reach your right arm and left leg straight out and then repeat on the other side.  Workout #3 is called Stabilization, and, to me, felt a lot like a core rather than an ab workout.  It starts with standing forward bends, then you get into the plank position (here I thought, ""Ok, here comes the ab work"", but I was wrong because you begin to do pushups!).  Then you lay on your stomach, stretch your abs, and do the breaststroke.  This is followed by some table top exercises and some excellent core work while on your side.  There is also some more plank work where you alternate lifting your legs.
Overall this is a great core workout, but if you want to focus on abs, you will have to work around some of the stuff on this DV",1072742400,18,1877,4.479411764705882
1832079,4,B000089QAJ,"I really like all of the QuickFix titles and this is no exception. I own the QuickFix Pilates and Yoga total mix so I was worried that these Pilates abs moves were the same just recycled but thats not the case. The workouts are short but effective,the countdown clock is motivating,overall its a great addition to my ever growing DVD collection, I do think you need to be familiar with basic pilates first though-this is not an overly easy dvd.",1050105600,5,444,4.5625

7980855,5,B000089QAJ,"I've bought this DVD so many times over the years (after losing or scratching up my old copies). It's just been my favorite pilates DVD I've ever tried. I think it comes down to the instructor in the videos a lot of the time, and I really like the woman in this video.

The video is challenging but its good because you can see yourself improving the more you do it. Highly recommend!",1428969600,,384,4.260273972602739
7980856,5,B000089QAJ,"I first purchased the Quick Fix Pilates Abs Workout in 2006 and after using it, saw rapid results within a couple of weeks.  The DVD states that it is designed to tone and strengthen your core; however, I found that with a sensible diet, I not only lost inches, but weight, and very quickly.  Several years later I became very complacent with my eating habits and hardly worked out at all.  This lead me to gain weight once again.  At this point, it had been at least 3 years since using the Quick Fix Pilates Abs workout.  I decided to pull it off the shelf and workout at least 3 to 4 times per week along with eating a balanced diet to include whole grains and fruits, and the weight once again started coming off, all within 30 days.  The three 10 minute workouts are well designed for the convenience of your own home and for any level of exercise.  If you want to see results, and see them quickly, I highly recommend that you purchase this DVD!  Thanks Keli, Portia & Liz Beth , for a great DVD!

7980857,2,B000089QAJ,"Very simple. Product ok. Distributer used not. The video was packed in a simple plastic back. No protection whatsoever. Surprise, surprise, upon arrival, although the DVD was still intact, the box was completely shattered.",1311379200,,222,5.5588235294117645
7980858,5,B000089QAJ,"This is an excellent DVD, but here are a few pointers for prospective buyers before you try this one out -
Though there is some good encouragement on basic pilates principles (breathing, etc.), this is not a basic workout.  Once you get about five minutes into the first segment, you start jumping into intermediate/advanced moves.
Second, the format is great in that you can have three separate workouts or one thirty minute, but if you are in good shape, you are probably going to want more, and pilates hard-core nuts are going to want something more whole-body.  For example, this would work well to use it like I have - after weightlifting at the gym and use this for your core/ab stuff.
So, great for the time crunch, a bunch of concentrated intermediate/advanced pilates in a short period of time.  Does what it says, a quick fix.",1196640000,,837,4.680272108843537
7980859,3,B000089QAJ,"I think this is a good workout for beginners.  It gives solid instruction on correct form and breathing.  I love the Quick Fix Total, but did not find this one challenging enough.",1193875200,,179,4.5625
7980860,5,B000089QAJ,"I ordered this workout after trying a different quick fix pilates workout I had checked out at my library.  This one is more advanced, and I am enjoying it. I'd say about half of the moves are standard, and about half are advanced.  The instructor uses good technique, and is not chatting and laughing with the other women demonstrating the exercises throughout the workout as in some videos.  They are all muscular, very fit women, who don't appear to have implants, which is refreshing.  I recommend it.",1169510400,,505,4.7701149425287355
7980861,4,B000089QAJ,"I bought this before the holidays and it is coming in handy now. It works and I like the option of choosing an intensity. When I want a challenge, I can choose the high intensity and when I just want to please the mind that I did some abs, I can do the least intense. I would recommend it especially for first time Pilates use and for those resuming or beginning a fitness program.",1168300800,,381,4.162162162162162
7980862,5,B000089QAJ,"This is only the second Quick Fix program that I've aquired (the other being the Pilates/Yoga program) and once again I'm VERY impressed!

 Keli Roberts leads three ten minute segments. Other reviewers have done an excellent job outlining the segments so I won't waste your time by being redundant :)

 I will say that I found each of these segments to be sound, relatively easy to follow and very effective practices that can be done either singly or in combination w/ each other.

 I would definitely say that this isn't something for a stone beginner, but one should definitely start w/ something like ""Stott Basics"" to get a feel for the fundamentals of Pilates before trying something like this.

 Also, it is quite challenging, getting progressively harder from one segment to the next and is probably best for someone who is an experienced beginner or intermediate.

 If you are looking for a Pilates based Ab workout that can fit into most anyone's schedule, I feel you can't go wrong with this DVD.

  HIGHLY recommended!",1147478400,4,1030,4.850574712643678
7980863,5,B000089QAJ,"If you are looking for a pilates video for your abs/core, this is a great choice.  Keli Roberts leads 3-10 minute segments that target the entire area.  She is joined by Lizbeth and Portia, who shows beginner modifications.

Section one is classic pilates, Keli starts you off with a breathing exercise, and asks you to maintain this breathing throughout all the exercises.  The exercises included in this segment are single leg circles (which Lizbeth demonstrates for those with better flexibility), bridge (with added leg lifts and hip presses), hundred, leg lowers w/criss cross action, teasers, rollover, and swan dive.

Section two is called core combination, and the exercises you will see here are can can, rollup, single leg stretch, criss cross, double leg stretch, scissors, rolling like a ball, swimming, a neat twist on extended cat where you extend one arm and opposing leg to the side, and spinal work finishes out this segment.

Sections three is called stabilization and is the most difficult of the three.  There are a good amount of planks here, plus pushups, breastroke, and a brief side kick series.

I like this DVD quite a bit, and I always do it in it's entirety, like other reviewers have said the time goes by really fast and I like the way it flows.  I would rate this as intermediate, you do need to have some familiarity with pilates as there isn't any instruction so complete beginners should looks elsewhere.  Keli Roberts does a really nice job with this video, she is very pleasant and encouraging without being overly perky.  Highly recommended.",1143936000,5,1578,4.916981132075471
