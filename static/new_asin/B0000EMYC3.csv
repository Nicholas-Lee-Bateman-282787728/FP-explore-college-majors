8276933,4,B0000EMYC3,"I bought this DVD off of one of the alternate sellers, for about $10 with shipping, and I got it a few weeks ago. This is a really good DVD, its like 3 hours long and its basically made up of segments in snowboarding, skating, surfing, wakeboarding, bmx, and motox. For each, there are profiles of professionals, and then some videos. The surfing ones are my favorite, but each has some pretty good ones. In my opinion, ten dollars for a 3 hour long video is an awesome deal. I also like skate videos, and those are generally $20-30 for under an hour of skating. If you like any of those extreme sports, I recommend you check Bluetorch out. peace",1091059200,5,646,4.391666666666667
