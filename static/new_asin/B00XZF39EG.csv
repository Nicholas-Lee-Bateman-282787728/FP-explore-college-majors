7204544,5,B00XZF39EG,very different; actors were terrific in their roles; an ironic story/message....loved the surprise twists.,1438300800,,106,6.642857142857143
7204545,5,B00XZF39EG,Excellent movie!,1438214400,,16,7.5
7204546,5,B00XZF39EG,"Not your same old same old movie. Very different. Inspired script, casting, and acting. Thought provoking and haunting. It might make you think twice about the events that have shaped your life.",1437523200,,194,5.09375
7204547,5,B00XZF39EG,I can't say too much without giving away the twist.  This is a top notch indie thriller.  The story relentlessly gets pushed forward to the end. I was blown away by how well this film was put together.,1436832000,4,201,4.2631578947368425
7204548,3,B00XZF39EG,"A suicidal man named Percival (Leon Cain) hires a hit man named Steven Ray (Steve Mouzakis) to kill him because his previous attempts at committing suicide all failed.  Percival thinks he isn't be allowed to die because he's cursed.  The hit man thinks he's nuts, takes the man's money, shoots him in the head and leaves.  But Percival actually does survive.  The hit man thinks it's a fluke and kills him again but Percival survives again.  Every time he wakes up in the hospital being told how lucky he is to survive he's clearly thinking 'if they only knew' but keeps his mouth shut.  One of the times he was shot actually saved his life because the doctors find a large tumor during the surgery.

The Suicide Theory works best when the viewer has little idea where it is going.  The film has elements of a black comedy as Percival treats each near death experience as further proof that he's cursed but actually takes it surprisingly well considering that he's supposed to be suicidal.  There are also elements of a buddy film as the hit man allows himself to become closer to his intended target than is professional, initially just to facilitate murder attempts but eventually the hit man without realizing it becomes friends with Percival and even starts to question the morality of his profession and whether he can continue to kill people after Percival has brought out his long dormant human side.

When writer Michael J. Kospiah and director Dru Brown finally shows their cards, however, the film becomes infinitely less interesting.  The problem with movies that want to deal with large matters of fate or faith is that the more complicated the maze they are threading their characters through to make the point inevitably feels like manipulation by the filmmakers who are playing god with their characters in intentionally unrealistic ways that make it hard for the viewer not to notice the marionette strings on the characters.

I suppose if you can view the characters as people and what happens in The Suicide Theory as the hand of fate or God then it's likely you will find The Suicide Theory genuinely moving.  The third act felt like a lot of phony manipulation to me and rather than transcendence the movie crashed to earth with a heavy thud that left me disappointed and sad--and definitely not sad in any way that the filmmakers actually intended.  The Suicide Theory had the makings of a genuinely offbeat and interesting movie--unfortunately the hand of fate had other plans.",1436486400,4,2499,4.822014051522248
7204549,5,B00XZF39EG,"This Australian thriller took me by surprise in the best way possible!
The story revolves around the two main characters Steve (Steve Mouzakis) and Percival (Leon Cain). Steve is a hitman with no remorse. Percival is a man who wants desperately to die so he hires Steve to kill him because Percival believes he is cursed to live with his terrible grief because everything he has tried in the way of suicide has failed.

Both men have suffered  huge losses in in their lives due to the fact that both of  their significant others have been killed. To tell you more would most likely ruin the film .But I can say it deals with how different people handle loss, truth,guilt and remorse.

This is a brilliant film, although some of the twists not altogether unpredictable it still Packs a huge gut punch! It's also brilliantly acted and filmed. This is anything but a cookie cutter film and grabs hold of you right from the start and doesn't let go even after the film is over.

It's not really Horror but more of a thrilling journey and although there is violence there is nothing gory. There is some homophobic behavior exhibited by some of the characters but it's not gratuitous and has a rhyme and a reason.",1436486400,11,1207,4.569444444444445
7204550,5,B00XZF39EG,"I just stumbled upon this one while looking for horror films. What a pleasant surprise this one turned out to be! The two leads are engaging and believable and the writing is top notch. Plenty of twist and turns and a fair amount of violence. As another reviewer noted, you do need to pay attention. If you do you will be rewarded.",1445385600,,331,4.354838709677419
7204551,4,B00XZF39EG,"Very surprised by this one. Great overlapping story line, good acting, better than a lot of high budget films I've seen in a while!",1443744000,,131,4.5
7204552,1,B00XZF39EG,"This move was Dead on Arrival.  Yeah, we have a hit man feeling guilty about killing.  Really?  Bad career choice, dude!  He meets a man who wants to die but he cannot kill.  Inevitably, they  go through a slow convoluted plot and change places in the end.  Utter boredom.",1443139200,,272,4.428571428571429
7204553,4,B00XZF39EG,"So you understand where I'm coming from, please know that I'm *not* always a fan of thrillers.  The ones I like are special: Seven, for instance, isn't bad.  And Lucky Sleven's a stand-out.  So when I turned on ""Suicide Theory"", I wasn't sure what to expect.  But boy... I was thrilled with what I did find.  A dark psychological drama/thriller, Suicide Theory has captivating characters, great actors, and ingenious twists.  In my opinion, this is what indie film *should* be.  It's more than worth buying a copy to keep! :))",1442707200,,526,4.777777777777778
7204554,5,B00XZF39EG,I watched this on Netflix and put a copy in my Amazon cart.  I wanted my own copy to watch it again.,1442620800,,100,3.5454545454545454
7204555,3,B00XZF39EG,"The Suicide Theory has an interesting premise and features two actors with real chemistry, but fails just as it is about to cross the finish line.  The story requires some suspension of disbelief, but manages to be engaging for 3/4 of its run time...until a needlessly convoluted and gimmicky series of endings rips you out of the experience and leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  A shame, because the film gets so much right before it falls off the cliff of unbelievable plot twists.

Final Thought:  I would still recommend a rental of this, as there is quite a bit of meat on the bones and the acting is really really good...just be ready to walk away from the ending.",1442188800,5,758,5.080645161290323
7204556,5,B00XZF39EG,I really enjoyed it.  Very well put together.,1442016000,,45,4.625
7204557,5,B00XZF39EG,"Well made movie of unknown actors with a great, darkly humorous story line. Don't look away or you'll miss clues and hints of what's
to come. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Sad, funny, all the good elements of a keeper.",1440892800,4,219,4.5
7204558,5,B00XZF39EG,"Great Writing and great acting and most of all great story.  It is slow, but a good slow.  I love movies that are able to make one think.  If you are into a fast pace movie, don't rent. However if you like to watch a story, like a flower slowly unfolding and reveling itself, then this movie is for you.",1439856000,2,303,4.016666666666667

8717172,5,B00XZF39EG,"A really interesting story about a guy trying to commit suicide but finds he always survives any attempt, so he opts to a hit man to kill him off, where the only catch is, he realizes he can't be killed unless he DOESN'T want to die. The movie has a couple of interesting twists in the plot where Fate coincides within the entire story.  A truly well made movie!",1463961600,,362,4.246376811594203
8717173,3,B00XZF39EG,"The best thing about this movie is the bleak, deadpan humor. Its worth watching just for that.",1453507200,,94,4.588235294117647
8717174,3,B00XZF39EG,Not bad.. Was expecting more blood but overall I liked the movie.,1450656000,,65,4.5
8717175,5,B00XZF39EG,"I don't want to say anything specific to avoid spoilers but even if you guess the twist half way though it's a great movie and worth watching. The characters are all pretty realistic and likeable, the storyline is good, and the acting is pretty great. I can't really think of anything else to say without giving things away so I'll leave it at that.",1450137600,,349,4.46875
8717176,1,B00XZF39EG,"How stupid can a person be?  If someone really wants to die, get in an encounter with police officers with a loaded gun and refuse to put it down.  That easy, don't have to make a stupid movie about it.",1448150400,,202,4.025
8717177,5,B00XZF39EG,"Great story line, keeps you in suspense till the very end. Awesome movie. Highly recommended, only problem couldn't get on blu ray.",1447804800,,131,5.0
8717178,4,B00XZF39EG,It's an interesting movie that you won't get bored watching. Almost predictable but not quite. If you've got nothing better to do I would for sure say watch this.,1446768000,,162,4.620689655172414
8717179,5,B00XZF39EG,Had no idea what to expect but this movie was so so good. Lots of twists and turns,1445904000,,82,3.611111111111111
