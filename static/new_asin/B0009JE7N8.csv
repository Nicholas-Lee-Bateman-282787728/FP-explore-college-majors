2294744,5,B0009JE7N8,My is so in Love with these movies. He's 4 & loving these series of DVD's. You your child loves Hot Wheels then you must get the Acceleracers DVD's & all the cars to go along with. Can't wait for Breaking Point to be released!!!!!!!!!!! These Dvd's are ones that your whole family will enjoy! I know mine does!!!!!!!!!!,1127433600,,319,4.423728813559322
2294745,1,B0009JE7N8,"I bought this for my 5 year old's birthday and I was disgusted.  He loved World Race and so did I but I think this one has gone too far.  I don't like how it talks about Marky being in prison and that a lot of the characters have tatoos on them.  They made all the characters look so old and it just seems more violent to me than World Race. Kids shouldn't have to be exposed to that stuff in a cartoon.  I only watched 1/3 of it and turned it off. The next day I took it back to get a refund.  I'm going to buy World Race but not this one!  Frankly, I am surprised at all the positive reviews.",1126569600,12,594,3.7886178861788617
2294746,5,B0009JE7N8,"He loved World race but the Acceleracers movies are even more exciting to him, he gets so into them I just can't believe how much attention he pays to these movies, he knows every detail! The graphics have changed and the plot and characters have become more complex and even a little dark. I myslef enjoyed it but was a little disappointed in the character Marky Wylde from the World Race, I think they went a little to far with him not just just in physical change but in his whole attitude. It kind of confused my son too but other than that the movies are GREAT!!!",1125705600,,568,4.317757009345795
2294747,4,B0009JE7N8,"I have a 4 year old boy that started loving hot wheels back when the first Hot Wheels ""World Race"" movie came out. I had to sit through that and the first Acceleracers movie probably over 100 times combined, and while I can't exactly say I loved them, they grew on me and I felt they were well-done.

The latest Acceleracers movie nicely builds on the last two movies, giving greater depth to the characters while keeping the tradition of offering exciting races in other-worldly environments.

This Acceleracer movie is also a little bit on the dark side. The first one dealt with the possible death of one of the main characters, quite a bit of in-fighting between the groups, and a fair amount of injury and destruction. This one expands on that but does a better job of explaining the history between some of the conflicts. For a 4-8 year old kid, it will probably all be well above their heads, but it keeps the movies interesting for adults and adds more of an element than just mindless racing and explosions.

The audio in this movie was also very well done. I may actually have to look into a soundtrack for this movie, because some of it is good enough to listen to on an iPod. The tie-ins for the toys is not that obvious, and I kind of wish there was better marketing from Mattel on this series, because I have a feeling it will not get the exposure it deserves (the previous two films got practically no exposure unless you happened to catch a blurb on the Cartoon Network about them).

Over all, this is a decent flick for adults, and great movie for the hot-wheels-minded child, and you can expect the kids to want to watch it repeatedly until part 3 comes out later this year.",1124928000,,1692,4.448387096774193
2294748,4,B0009JE7N8,"The story of Vert Wheeler and his racing friends that began in ""Hot Wheels World Race"" and ""Hot Wheels Acceleracers: Ignition"" continues here.

""Vert"" Wheeler and the rest of the Teku racing team must work with their rivals the Metal Maniacs to drive in the ""Racing Realms"", other dimensional race tracks that test a driver's racing skills to their extreme limit. Whoever reaches the finish line of each realm first receives an ""Accelercharger"", which grants the user's vehicle a special power (frictionless driving, hyperspeed, etc). Scattered throughout the realms are ""Hyperpods"", which the driver's car can attach to give it special abilities as well.

Unfortunately, the evil Gelorum has obtained the Wheel Of Power (see the Hot Wheels World Race DVD) and her robots will stop at nothing to obtain all the Accelerchargers!! If they do, they will be able to take over the world, which is NOT a good thing for us humans!

Not only that, but a mysterious THIRD racing team, the Silencerz, have shown up! Who (and what) are they, and are they on the side of good or evil?

This episode does a great job of propelling the main storyline, as well as moving along several subplots. It's always fun to watch adventures with the Hot Wheels drivers as they take on Gelorum and her drones on fantastic race tracks.

A lot of the reservations I had about the Hot Wheels Acceleracers : Ignition release are not as strong here.

- The Teku and Metal Maniacs now appear more as rival racing teams (which they should have been anyway) as opposed to rival street racing gangs.

- The physical violence content has been reduced as well. There's nothing on this disc that resembles the opening sequence of the Ignition DVD when Dr Tezla was attacked by the drones.

My children enjoy this DVD, and look forward to future Hot Wheels Acceleracers DVDs.

The Cartoon Network has already broadcast the third part of the Hot Wheels Accceleracers saga, Breaking Point, and will be airing the fourth episode ""Hot Wheels Accceleracers: The Ultimate Race"" on October 1st of 2005. If you missed part 3, they usually rebroadcast them the day before the new episode, so look for it on Friday, September 30, 2005.

This DVD comes with 6 micro-episodes, that contain racing and plot elements in realms not shown in the main movie (the Cliffside Realm and the Ice Realm).

Check out my reviews of the Hot Wheels World Race and Hot Wheels Acceleracers: Ignition DVDs for more information on those titles.",1124496000,,2474,4.811320754716981
2294847,5,B0009JE7N8,My son loved this movie!  It completed his collection of the Acceleracers.  I even got hooked into watching all four movies.,1168819200,,124,4.857142857142857
2294848,5,B0009JE7N8,"For the kids who loved the original movie, this series is great!  Mom checked, kid approved.",1168300800,,92,4.75
2294849,4,B0009JE7N8,"My 5-year old loves the Acceleracers movies.  Each one is a great continuation of the previous.  He enjoys the different cars, realms, and races.  My husband enjoys watching with him as well.",1167782400,,191,4.90625
2294850,5,B0009JE7N8,"The movie is about racing. I like it because it's an action movie. The characters are TEKU,METALMAIAC,DRONES and SILENCERZ.It takes place in the ACCELADRONE and REALMS. I like it for three reasons. First, I like it because it's a racing movie. Second, I like it because it is an action movie. Third, I like it when the monster smashes the cars. I think my friends would like it because they likes Hot Wheels. I give it two wheels up!",1159833600,,433,4.493670886075949
2294851,4,B0009JE7N8,"PLEASE BRING BACK TARO KITANO AS HE WAS IN WORLD RACE!!!!  Okay, I sort of got that out of my system.  SO continues the saga, but you need to view/watch the ""extras"" (read: realms) for plot points, etc.  This volume had much less violence and some more levity than ""Ignition"", but many questions are still left unanswered - where is Banjee??  Why was Mark Wylde in prison?  What happened between Lani and Taro that they don't seem to like each other?  <sigh>  I guess I'll just have to wait for the next two DVDs (I hope my questions are answered).  Still, an interesting movie if you liked the previous two (World Race and Ignition).  Cool cars and cool realms.  Vert disappears for a while to determine if he was lucky or really was the best driver.  Galorum has someone - does she have others?  Will the drivers care more about the race or their friends?",1142899200,2,857,4.458064516129032
2294852,5,B0009JE7N8,"It's good, it's cool and I like it.  It's better than Ignition because they race in better realms.  If you liked Ignition, you'll love this.",1142726400,,140,4.56
2294853,3,B0009JE7N8,"I have purchased both the first Hotwheels movie, and Vol. 1 of the episodes. This one didn't have any new twists or new turns over the story. Infact at a point they will brush off the count of how many rounds where won between the two teams. My boys injoyed it, but I guess since I get to judge it ( I gave it a three), I was thinking of my self injoynment. I guess my boys would actually give it a 4 star. All in all it was good fun for the my boys (6, 10 y/old).",1142035200,2,464,3.7448979591836733
2294854,5,B0009JE7N8,"I was so excited about this DVD when it came out! I saw this movie on Cartoon Network and it's MUCH better than Ignition. A lot more info is revealed in this movie, and the realms that the drivers go into are really cool. There's also a lot more humor in this movie than before (courtesy of Monkey LOL)! But like I said before, when these were premired on Cartoon Network, they were given a Y7 rating for fear and violence. My 5 year old brother has no problem with this movie, so other boys his age will probably like it too. And my whole family, down to my 3 year old sister, enjoys this movie, so I'm sure your little boys (and girls!) will too.",1131408000,,648,4.150793650793651
2294855,5,B0009JE7N8,"My son will be 9 in December, and absolutely loves cars.  These DVDs are his favorites!  He understand the good/bad aspect of the whole story, and loves to quiz me to see if I know which driver belongs to each car.  I usually do pretty well too.  I look forward to parts 3 and 4 being released on DVD.",1129593600,,301,4.0508474576271185

8061922,4,B0009JE7N8,"I mistakenly sold this dvd at a flea market because it was in the wrong case.  My kids never stopped reminding what a dumb move that was.  So, I finally got around to ordering it recently.  I watched this series over and over with my sons and never got tired of it.  The story is very well thought out and some of the characters are a little over the top, but the voice acting is well done.  We were all left hanging at the end of the 4th installment and wanted more.  I have not seen Hot Wheels Battle Force 5, but from what I've read, it's sadly not a continuation of Acceleracers.  Wish they would come out with a sequel or two or a weekly cartoon of it.",1367625600,,657,4.046511627906977

8061927,5,B0009JE7N8,"My son has this entire series, and I have to sit through at least one of them every day.  He is 5, is enamored with cars, including Hot Wheels, and loves these movies more than anything.  They aren't my first choice in viewing as a 30 year old female, but they really aren't too bad, so I don't complain much.  In fact - thank God for these movies, it's the only way I get cleaning done at my house!!!!! I hope they come out with more.",1199664000,,435,4.034883720930233
