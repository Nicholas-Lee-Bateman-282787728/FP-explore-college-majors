3830409,4,B00205X95G,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, not to mention that it features both of my nieces Joyce and Debra Glenn. I would recommend this film to middle school age and above to help assist them in making healthy choices in life.",1395705600,2,214,4.2439024390243905
3830410,5,B00205X95G,"I work with juvenile girls, so when I should this to them, it became a rap session. An intense , questioning, mouth dropping rap session.
I suggested this to all parents who have daughters .
This was an excellent film. A type of scared Straight .  It is informative, thought provoking, making choices, your own decisions and about who you are movie.
They need to to one surrounding young men as well.",1292630400,2,400,4.555555555555555
3830411,4,B00205X95G,"This movie was low budget but I enjoyed watching this movie.  There is so much to learn from this movie.  If you have a teenage daughter, this is a movie that can initiate a dialogue between you and her.  It will begin to spark the curious mind.  This movie will bring alertness that can hopefully help or prevent a young lady from following in the foot step of Angel.  Give this movie a try.  It is worth the money.  I highly recommend this movie especially for young ladies.",1279584000,4,476,4.340909090909091
3830412,4,B00205X95G,"This is a low budget movie. But all movies that don't make it to the Big screen, don't mean there no good. I rated it as Liked it, being I kept it. Many young ladies may learn something from it, if they don't have this attitude they have things under control. The acting was ok, I say ok, because I am no actor. So that may have being their best. Take her and put her with D. Washington, he could make her look like she was a top lead actress. The plot was indeed something that is happening in this world today. Would be a good watch for a sleepover of girls 11 and up. I would have say 13, but girls are working it even young today.
 I don't have a daughter, but two sons. I teach them to treat a woman/girl how they would want a man to treat me.
This young lady seem to be looking for attention going down a road that many girls walk. They try to hide things that come to the light one way or another. If you can't be open to your mother, then find some one you can. Parents need to take their lunch at lease once a week with their child. And if you feel they are doing things you don't feel is right. Pop up at the school a few time, and see if they don't think twice about showing that butt. Spear the rod, spoil the child. If they live where you pay bills, then they can get a butt whipping. We think that at the age of 13 or a big size kid, we cant spank them or deal with them. This is how they know we love them, by dealing with them and listing to them. See what is happening to make them act out, what it is they seek.
Watch it. It was worth the $8.00",1261180800,6,1562,3.866043613707165
3830413,5,B00205X95G,"This is definitely a film for families to hurry up and watch right now. What made the film even more moving is the fact that the message was loud and clear about first love, secrets, and the art of parents communicating with their children. Very good movie.",1503532800,,257,4.48936170212766
3830414,4,B00205X95G,Wow this movie is facts regarding teen pregnancy. I don't know if Sex education is taught in school anymore but this is a film to alert awareness as most teenagers are unaware of these facts. This movie was right on point.,1488585600,,222,4.439024390243903
3830415,4,B00205X95G,"Factual. Intelligent. I don't know how it comes across to its target audience of teenagers, but I'm cautiously optimistic its messages would get through.",1487721600,,153,5.416666666666667
3830416,5,B00205X95G,"I liked this film.  It presented information in a very calm way.  Sad to see that, it being based on a true story, that neither girls nor boys realize that boys are fertile 24/7 and yet still blame unwanted pregnancy on the girl.  As fertile as they are, boys aren't prepared to do anything about not producing unwanted children.",1487462400,,329,4.5423728813559325
3830417,4,B00205X95G,It really hit home when it comes to our children making the wrong choice. also the movie showed how parent / parents should listen to their children and not beat them down.,1486166400,,172,4.40625
3830418,5,B00205X95G,This movie delves into the consequences of teenage pregnancy for which most teenagers are unaware.  The main character Angel gave a wonderful performance and was also credible.,1485475200,2,176,5.518518518518518

3830420,3,B00205X95G,"This movie supposedly based on real events, concerns a teen-aged girl, who makes wrong choices concerning boys and sex, and ends up paying grave consequences as results of these choices she made. It was an okay story, and not being a movie critic, that's all I can say, except that I enjoyed it.",1485129600,,295,4.584905660377358

3830422,5,B00205X95G,"It was awesome.  Our church (Sanders Creek Baptist  Church ln Camden,  SC) used it when we conducted our healthy image of sex class. It was great. Our kids ages 15-19 really enjoyed it. Very educational.",1413417600,,203,4.742857142857143
8348417,5,B00205X95G,"I absolutely adored this movie. I learned a bit on the process. The acting was pretty good and the story was interesting. I want my teenagers to watch it, just to be aware that all it takes is ONE time. Also the message that you shouldn't hide STDs because they can get worse was very important!!",1525132800,,296,4.303571428571429
8348418,4,B00205X95G,It is real life situations and certain parts of the movie are very informative.,1523664000,,79,4.714285714285714
8348419,5,B00205X95G,Great message for teenagers!,1522022400,,28,6.25
8348420,4,B00205X95G,"WILD that I came across this movie again years after seeing it at a ""women's christian convention/retreat"" when I was a pre-teen in Georgia. It was hosted by some chick that had a small role in ""Hair Show"". It was horrible acting and cheap production to me then and horrible acting and cheap production then now but I guess it has a good message even though I don't subscribe to christianity anymore.",1521417600,,400,4.569444444444445
8348421,4,B00205X95G,This would be a great movie for 8th grade and up.,1516406400,,49,3.5454545454545454

8348423,4,B00205X95G,It was a good movie. If you have children it helps to remind you that kids should be able to talk to their parents. I think parents should see this movie.,1509235200,,154,4.0
8348424,1,B00205X95G,I rated this story a 2 because I think the message may have tried to be positive however the movie is very biased. I did not like how in the movie all the white kids were portrayed as the smart thinkers and the black kids made all the bad decisions and came from broken homes....,1507507200,2,279,4.090909090909091
8348425,5,B00205X95G,Great movie and a big lesson to be learn,1506988800,,40,3.5555555555555554
8348426,4,B00205X95G,I absolutely adored this movie.  The young actors did well especially the lead actresses.  It is a great insight into the mind of a naive young girl and the mistakes that many have made.  I like the supporting characters too (the older sister and mother).  A good 8th grade or 9th-grade movie.,1503619200,,293,4.576923076923077
