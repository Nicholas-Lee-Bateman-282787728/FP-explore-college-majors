8497812,4,B006GU4H0C,"I bought several dance instruction DVDs by Shawn Trautman (and others) to help my father to learn the Latin dance steps. Shawn has several wonderful dance instruction videos, but I have learned to read the labels carefully.  If the title is ""[Dance Step] 101,"" three of the five sections will be devoted to clapping out the beat, learning how to connect to your partner (hand placement) and tips for giving a strong lead. The fourth track offers several dance steps. The fifth track puts it all together as the couple dances.
Since I wanted my father to be familiar with appropriate steps for the faster music played in ballrooms, my strategy for teaching him was to buy the appropriate ""sampler"" DVD so he could see the dance performed [see my other reviews], the ""Salsa 101"" DVD reviewed herein and finally the best Mambo DVD that I could find. (Mambo steps are the same as Salsa, and my father needed styling tips beyond the basic footstep pattern.)
This particular product is very good and I think that Shawn Trautman is a great instructor for men.  I own many of his other dance-instruction DVDs for country western and disco dancing. For learning Salsa, this product is adequate but not as deep as a perfectionist might demand.
Consider how much money you are willing to spend to learn one dance; I bought three separate DVDs to lure my father onto the dance floor when the beat gets fast. Now he says that his biggest problem in a ballroom is finding an 80-year-old lady who wants to do the Mambo!",1358208000,3,1504,4.650375939849624
8497813,5,B006GU4H0C,"After taking a Salsa class recently, I felt the class did not cover enough moves for me to show at the dance floor. So I decided to get this DVD and I am glad I did. It had enough moves for me to show on the dance floor and they were very well explained and demonstated. Being able to quickly rewind and watch the moves over was a plus.",1342915200,,336,3.8840579710144927
