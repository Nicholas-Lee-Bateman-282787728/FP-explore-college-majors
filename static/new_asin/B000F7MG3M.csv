2554480,2,B000F7MG3M,"After trying to do several of the sessions, I became frustrated and disappointed especially after the reviews I had read before ordering.  The transitions between the exercises were quick and disjointed making it hard to follow.  My husband also found it difficult AND boring because the transitions were so quick.  Just when we were doing the stretches, off they would go to another position.  I returned it.",1171670400,6,409,5.059701492537314
2554481,5,B000F7MG3M,"If you have been thinking of buying a Pilates video but are a little bit scared by the reputation for toughness and difficulty getting into it, this is THE one for you!  And for me, too.  I bought this, the regular Classical Pilates Mat Workout, and the Magic Circle Mat Workout.  All three have multiple levels of workout given, but the other two go at a much faster pace, and you really need to know more before you can be comfortable with them.

This video starts with wonderful pre-Pilates work that is very easy to follow, and which you can do by itself if, like me, you sometimes overstrain your back.  The people doing the demonstrations are great.  I especially appreciate that the man in the Basic Workout is not a buff hunk, but looks like a normal, not-terribly fit human being.  (He may BE in wonderful condition, but he does not look so intimidating)

You could think of this as just for beginners, but you may end up using it as your central all-round workout!

Can't recommend it highly enough!",1156032000,27,1009,4.530386740331492
2554482,5,B000F7MG3M,"Classical Pilates DVD for the Neck and Back is an in depth study of how to use the Pilates method in it's most rehabilitative form. This valuable DVD demonstrates the fundamental movements and exercises with clear, slow, gentle and precise instruction.

The viewer learns how to safely start step by step to introduce movement and release the stress and tension in the body.

I began learning Pilates because of a back injury and more recently have benefited from my regular practice as I recover from a neck injury. I have been free from back problems and pain due to my having been taught the method as presented on this DVD. I am now finding the same relief and rehabilitation for my neck as I use this valuable DVD to continue my workouts.

In this DVD you will learn how to un-stress the muscles that have overprotected the injured areas by doing exercises the re-align posture, increase abdominal strength, flexibility and range of motion. This DVD guides you through careful movements by the use of modifications to give you a gage to do the exercises at the level your body can safely and comfortably handle and then move to the next level of exercises when you are ready.

As recommended on the DVD consult with your Doctor before starting.

Basic Mat - this workout you use modified positions to increase spinal movement. A pillow helps eliminate the tendency to hold tension in the neck. You can easily follow

the slow precise movements and the amount of exercise sets that recommended.

Intermediate Mat - the focus is on the neck using modifications with the aid of a pillow to give support while you learn to slowly and progressively increase movement. It also

shows you how to gain strength in the neck without straining or overworking it. You can do the exercises at your own pace and level.

Modified Intermediate Mat - teaches how to stabilize the pelvis and spine for good abdominal support and strength and how to do transitions correctly and slowly as you move from exercise to exercise. Correctly done transitions protect you from sudden unnecessary movements that can strain the body.

This DVD is beneficial for recovering from a number of injuries and you can adjust the exercise to benefit your individual situation. With practice your whole body will be strengthen and in optimal condition to support the body in healing the individual injured parts. Any changing or watering down of the Pilates method renders it ineffective so I recommend carefully following this DVD which teaches the original method.

I highly recommend this DVD for recovery and maintaining good physical health.",1154822400,29,2613,4.889140271493213
2554483,5,B000F7MG3M,"The Classical Pilates Technique series of DVDs has long served me as an important adjunct to my knowledge and skill in Pilates. As a Pilates practitioner, trainer, and studio owner, these DVDs have been indispensable as both a review of correct technique and as an inspiration of the technique performed as an art form.

The latest release, ""Classical Pilates Technique with consideration of the Neck and Back,"" continues all the strengths of the original titles, but surpasses their technical quality and aesthetic interest. It is expertly shot with a beautiful background. Like the other Classical Pilates Technique titles, this DVD presents all workouts in real time, with voice-over commentary provided by best-selling Pilates author Alycea Ungaro, P.T. and Megan Rich, P.T. The commentary is precise, thorough, and easy to understand.

This DVD contains three full Classical Pilates mat workouts that focus on the stability of the neck and back. For those individuals who are unable to safely exercise within the Classical Pilates system, the DVD also contains a full pre-Pilates section aimed at facilitating the movement of the spine in a full and comfortable symptom-free range of motion, as well as bringing awareness to posture, alignment, and correct usage of the abdominal muscles.

As a previous reviewer suggested, this DVD is also helpful to people without neck or back issues. For an older person or someone who hasn't exercised in a while, this DVD provides a very thorough and safe introduction to Pilates.

There is a presence within the Pilates Community that believes the Classical method of Pilates is bad for the neck and back. This DVD should dispel that myth, as it demonstrates that most beginning and intermediate mat exercises can be modified within the Classical system to accommodate anyone.",1146614400,43,1821,5.247422680412371
2554484,5,B000F7MG3M,"This program is good for people who have some physical problems and it's good for people without problems who aren't yet able to do full-out Pilates. So it's good for every body.

During the past few years I've gotten into fitness for all the health reasons and just because it makes me feel better. As a foundation for every activity I enjoy Pilates classes and I take lessons at a local studio. I feel good!

This DVD program has a thorough approach. There is a section called ""Pre-Pilates"" which is very good if you have had physical problems and you're starting out slowly. Then there's a basic workout to help the neck and back stay safe as you exercise. Afterward is an intermediate workout for the neck, and an intermediate workout for the back. The instruction it very precise. I can almost hear my previous physical therapist's voice telling exactly what to do with each movement.

These Classical Pilates people take their work seriously and make the exercises beautiful to watch. They also have three thoughtful conversations with industry professionals to help you understand the background and purpose of practicing Classical Pilates. This DVD gives deep substance and safe workouts if you're symptom-free or if you have neck and back problems.",1145318400,24,1257,4.947867298578199
2554485,5,B000F7MG3M,"I have been taking pilates privately for a year and often have to make adjustments due to neck and shoulder pain.  It's of great value to have a tape at home that I can safely follow between my private sessions.  Video quality - very professional, clear instruction, challenging pace.

8118696,3,B000F7MG3M,"Looks like a good DVD, but even though I can do a lot of things, and used to be a Mat Pilates Instructor, this just too hard on my back.  I had double fusion and a laminectomy 1 1/2 years ago, and the rolling up isn't possible for me.  Might help someone with just a sore back.",1418256000,,277,3.8421052631578947
8118697,5,B000F7MG3M,This DVD contains three full Classical Pilates mat workouts that focus on the stability of the neck and back. Great movements and exercises for those who have injuries and is also helpful to people without neck or back issues. Highly recommended!,1334275200,,246,5.024390243902439
8118698,3,B000F7MG3M,"In the span of five years, I underwent major surgery that required cutting my lower abdominal muscles, was hit by a car while out jogging that affected my left lower leg and back, and was in a head-on car accident that herniated two discs in my neck. At that time, diagnostic tests revealed I also have degenerative disc disease which is progressively compromising my already limited flexibility.
Fortunately, I was already familiar with Pilates and had a home reformer and other equipment before my surgery and accidents and over the years, I have found Pilates to be more beneficial than either chiropractic or physical therapy.
With time, I have recovered amazingly well but I do have issues when working out that can be extremely frustrating. I was hoping to find some new pointers in this DVD that would help my progress and performance, but that just wasn't the case.
It's not that this is a bad DVD, not by any means. It's just not for someone, especially a lifelong exerciser, who has been released from physical therapy long ago and is now coping with the residue of old injuries.
That said, the pre-Pilates segments are excellent for someone who is rehabilitating and has been given a medical green light to exercise, or even an older person just beginning to exercise. I also wish I would have had this DVD just after my abdominal surgery.  It would have been the ideal workout to ease back into an exercise routine. I also think the DVD in its entirety could be extremely beneficial for those who are overweight and are limited by girth and/or heaviness from performing  standard Pilates movements.
But for someone like myself, a seasoned exerciser (or athlete) who became injured and now has ongoing limitations, I think it misses the mark.
On my own, I have learned to not only stretch before each workout, whether it be a class or a DVD, I often do brief and very specific stretches BEFORE each exercise, which deviates from the flow a little but helps immensely. For example, I will pretzel stretch on each side BEFORE (as well as after) the sidekick series. I stretch my hamstrings (I've incorporated a mat version of The Tree)before performing 1-leg circle series. This helps immensely. I would no more approach Pilates or any other workout without preparation than I would walk out into a blizzard without a coat.
I do think the DVD has a few flaws. There should be more visual cuing in the introductory workout especially because people respond better to visual/verbal than verbal cuing alone. It may sound silly, but this DVD also didn't repeat pain warnings enough. I can tell you, though, that often the biggest mistake with rehabilitation is pushing too hard. This is particularly common among athletes and seasoned exercises who are accustomed to challenging themselves, often to the max. This mentality just doesn't work in rehabilitation-- there's a very fine line between working hard enough and too hard which can knock you back to Square One-- and it can be a hard one to relinquish.
I also think a brief discussion of the pillow used is in order, as is a visual demonstration of the performer removing it, as it may actually aggravate a neck injury. This is true, in my case (probably due to the location and nature of my injured discs) while the more ergonomically friendly Reformer headrest eases my trouble spots.
Also, if you watch the initial pre-Pilates section on this DVD, take note of the medical terminology. Because after giving the layman's terms for the medical ones ONE TIME, they opt to use the former in the rest of the DVD. This is, quite frankly, a mistake when trying to appeal to the masses. In Communications101 the very first thing you learn is to always uses the simplest language possible when trying to communicate with a broad spectrum of people from varying backgrounds.
All in all, this is a good DVD, just not for my specific needs. As an aside, if you are reading this because you are recovering from an injury or surgery, I would like to offer you hope and encouragement. For every day you are frustrated and discouraged with rehabilitation (and I know, there are many) you will have others where you are absolutely amazed and thrilled with your progress. Given the right tools, the body will heal whenever it can, and when it cannot heal, it will adapt. In my opinion, Pilates, along with practice, patience and persistence, is one of the right tools, if not the best, for encouraging both.",1246665600,15,4453,4.781818181818182
8118699,5,B000F7MG3M,"I've been taking mat pilates for about a year, so am familiar with the poses. This video moved at about the same speed as my teacher and used an identical routine. It was exactly what I was looking for- a replacement for when I can't get to class because of computer deadlines. It worked my back, shoulders and neck just enough to undo the knots.",1233792000,,346,4.338461538461538
8118700,4,B000F7MG3M,"Given all of the Pilates classes and DVDs out there, I was searching for an introduction that would also provide modified exercises for the neck. (I had broken my neck one year ago, completely atrophying the muscles in my torso and my coordination, posture, and sense of balance were virtually gone.) So I ordered this DVD. What I didn't realize is HOW SERIOUS these people are about Pilates. They are stressing Classical Pilates EXACTLY as Joseph Pilate taught it and there are even half hour long interviews with different Pilates experts about how, and they must have some sort of issue with physical therapy, Pilates and physical therapy can ""live"" together or if they are too different in terms of focus to NOT be used together. I believe that they decided that the two can be used together in treating the physically-impaired with modified exercises with the goal being able to do the classic and technically true to form exercises.

This is a very very long DVD because of the interviews, which you can choose not to watch if you just want to learn very serious formal classic Pilates with great emphasis on technique. There are 3 formal sections:

1. Pre-Pilates
- absolute beginner teaching on a set of techniques and ""exercises"" while seated in a chair. The focus is on technically defining and showing, using a once-injured ballerina, when to inhale and exhale and how exactly to move or not move different vertebrae and the cervical bones. It was only about 10 minutes but completely wore me out from the intellectual concentration as well. I look forward to doing it again, however.
- the same thing, but on a mat. This takes about 12 minutes.

2. Basic mat. Several less challenging, basic exercises (like the 100) done on the mat. Only about 6 minutes long. These exercises do not modify, as far as I could tell, on the neck or back. Yet.

3. Intermediate Mat:  For the Back. Not sure exactly how long it was, but it blew away the Basic Mat routine. (I'm sure I didn't get the name perfectly right, sorry.) This is an extended routine and modifies the exercises for the back. It runs through several exercises and the instructors use perfect form. It is a bit awe-inspiring to watch their precision. They mention posture and that these exercises help strengthen the neck muscles so that your shoulders are not drawn up by the neck...

Intermediate for the Back. In this case, the same or a very similar routine, now modified for the back, is shown. I noticed that the gentleman tucked his chin very tightly into his neck.

If you are seriously interested in precision in form, when to inhale and exhale, how to carry out movements, this is the DVD for you. The movements are carried out at a slightly slower pace to explain the details of how to breathe and move, at least in the first few sections.

I am sure that this DVD will perfect anyone's posture and do some toning. But it is not the typical workout video at all. It is more academic and focuses on truly classical traditional Pilates.",1231891200,14,3009,4.664150943396226
8118701,5,B000F7MG3M,"This DVD is very easy to follow and does modify the traditional Pilates moves to minimize the neck and back strain that can accompany some of the exercises - especially when one doesn't have sufficient core strength when starting the program.  This allows you to work on a very limited subset of moves - especially at the beginner level.  Although I feel that there's a big jump from beginner to intermediate-level excercises - both in duration and complexity - I nevertheless, believe that this DVD was a really excellent purchase. I use it a lot.",1207958400,5,548,4.757894736842105
8118702,4,B000F7MG3M,"This DVD is great if you are a Pilates instructor, or have previous experience in Pilates, but have neck or back issues. Instruction is thorough, clear, and direct. Wonderful to enhance instructor repertoire.",1184889600,2,208,5.333333333333333
8118703,5,B000F7MG3M,"Pilates is a method which is valuable to anyone of any age or condition and this DVD shows you the modifications that are made for people with neck and/or back issues. Pilates, however, should always be initated with a qualified instructor - it should not be started 'straight' from a DVD because you need a lot of individual correction at first before your body has incorporated (understood) the Pilates principles. This DVD is an essential tool for instructors, as a reference work and perons who have previous Pilates training.",1179100800,4,530,4.966292134831461
