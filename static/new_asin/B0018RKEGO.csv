3418833,4,B0018RKEGO,"Ordered this for my 2 yo for Christmas. He's a big Handy Manny fan and these are really cute episodes. He gets his little tool box out and plays along 'fixing' up things in the room. The center plastic piece that holds the DVD in place was broken, but the DVD was not damaged, so that's why only 4 stars. Otherwise a good buy, quick shipping.",1326585600,,342,4.196969696969697
3418834,5,B0018RKEGO,"I love the whole Handy Manny series. My son clicked into these short, 10-minute, charming animated segments right away, when he was a little over one. They always have dashes of humor throughout the shows. I like that each of the tools has his or her own distinct personality; that Handy Manny and the rest of the Sheetrock Hills community are kind, decent characters; and that the show tries to emphasize differences, in culture, age, race, language, work, etc., very positively. And the length of the shows is perfect for a short tv experience that keeps the little one's attention, 10-20 minutes for one or two shows.

The only thing I would change: when they show people of the community in the background walking down the street, they should have them interact, instead of just walking 'blindly' down the street -- I'm sure this is a cost-of-animation issue, but I think it would really add to the show.

Overall, a great series for kids. We have enjoyed all of the videos we've seen (the only one we haven't seen yet is Handy Manny: Manny's Green Team).",1317513600,2,1059,4.688172043010753

3418843,5,B0018RKEGO,Handy Manny is a great show that adds learning and humor all at the same time. You can't find it on TV anymore and Netflix removed it from their line up a couple weeks ago; my son was pretty upset. I jumped onto Amazon and bought 4 Handy Manny DVD's and they have worked out well so far.,1464480000,,287,3.9655172413793105

The most significant White character in the show is old, flaming gay and completely incompetent. If you want your White children to grow up with no self-esteem, then let them watch this show.

3418864,4,B0018RKEGO,My kids love Handy Manny so I was really excited to see I could get it dubbed in French as my children are in a French school.  Watching shoes in French helps build their vocabulary.  Unfortunately the video only had Spanish and English as language options.
