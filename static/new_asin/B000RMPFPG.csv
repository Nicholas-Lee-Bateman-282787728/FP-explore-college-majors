8201457,2,B000RMPFPG,"I love Callahan, so sad when he died. I own all his books and sometime challenge visitors to see how far into one of his books they can get without laughing out loud. But ""Quads"" is a travesty. My bet is that JC had little to do with it other than lend his name and characters to the project. Read his books instead and LOL. Do Not Disturb Further is the best.",1468540800,,360,4.013888888888889
8201458,3,B000RMPFPG,sound is tinny and just drops out then you have to keep stoping and starting the disc to try and get the sound back.,1417996800,,116,3.875
8201459,5,B000RMPFPG,"I love John Callahan. I'd pretty much buy anything of his. Much too short a life, but a full one from what I can see. This series is hysterically politically incorrect. Buy his books, too!",1388880000,,188,4.4
8201460,5,B000RMPFPG,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. It came quickly and was just what I was hoping for!,1380844800,,104,4.0
8201461,5,B000RMPFPG,"I've got to disagree with the previous negative review. I thought this show was hilarious. The ""vasectomy village"" episode in particular nearly killed me I laughed so hard.

Thankyou, John Callahan, for bottling such pure dark cynical humour and expressing it in such a creative and damn funny way.

Two thumbs way up (if I could move them)!

(And can this TV series be re-released on DVD downunder please?)",1271635200,2,407,4.869565217391305
8201462,2,B000RMPFPG,I'm an gimp and have followed Callahans weird warped sense of humor for years and loved it. But this is just dreadfull!! Maybe John Callahan went back to drinking. I sure needed a drink after watching the DVD!!,1270339200,,210,4.552631578947368
