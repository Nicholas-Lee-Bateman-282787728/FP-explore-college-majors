8432407,5,B000650R0W,"I love this movie. The cimematography is unreal for the time.

Huge elaborate scenes...unbelievable for a depression.

A total feast for the eyes.

If you love art deco, this interpretation of

egyptian is so grand.

Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra is a smart and sympathetic character.

She is so young,and she does what she has to do for Egypt.

The sets and costumes are heart stopping.

This one is so worth it.",1171843200,2,414,4.732394366197183
