3688452,4,B001LPWGGO,"The video on this production is pretty good considering that most of the source material is 25 or so years old.  The only criticism is that the feed used for most of the games is NOT the Islanders TV feed.  I have my own copies of several of these games with announcing by the Islanders TV crew, including their post-game programming (1983 Islanders Game 4 vs. Oilers and the 1984 Isles vs. Rangers Game 5 among others). If I could have these, surely the producers of this set could have obtained them.  Listening to CBC announcers or ESPN announcers is definitely not the same.  That aside, it is an enjoyable group of games.  Only the Isles vs. Maple Leafs 2002 game is questionable in its inclusion.  Enjoy the days of hockey with no on ice, or on the boards advertising and some helmetless players!",1239494400,4,802,4.534722222222222
3688453,5,B001LPWGGO,"While I was an early teen in the early '80's and had a Dad who refused to get cable, a lot of the Islander dynasty was seen through either the newspaper, the radio or my mind's eye. While I still cringe at the horror of the Ranger-Islander playoff game of 1984, one can still appreciate the Bossy's, Gillies, Smith's and Trottier's of the dynasty era up to the current team highlighted with the complete Al Arbor tribute which I thought was very classy and a good game as well. The quality on a couple of the early games is fairly weak but not enough for you not to enjoy. It's a good trip down memory for any NHL fan but a must have if your an Islander fan.",1239494400,,658,4.1484375
3688454,3,B001LPWGGO,Didn't like the first game had one of Nystrom's goals missing.  The game against the Penquins during the Randy Carlyle days was hazy looking.  But the bright side makes me want to see the entire Stanly Cup finals that the Islanders played.,1238716800,,239,4.666666666666667
3688455,1,B001LPWGGO,"I was disappointed. The box was completely broken inside. I thought about replacing but decided not to go through the hassle. I did it once before and the replacement was also broken. It's not only Amazon's fault here -- they use these plastic boxes with fragile moving hinges on the inside.  As for the games, also disappointing.  The picture quality of the Pittsburgh game from '82 is pretty bad and as for the '83 Edmonton game it's not as bad but still worse than I saw on espn classic.  The rest of the games are more decent quality.",1238716800,,538,4.469387755102041
3688456,5,B001LPWGGO,"I have been a die hard Islanders fan since 1972.  In fact, the Isles were the reason I started playing hockey at a time when no one else in my family knew what hockey was.  The Isles have brought me great joy and pain since I was 6 years old, and this is a great way to re-live the great times.

I have had many of these games on VHS, but as we all know tape degrades.  I can finally have a permanent record of these great moments.  I agree with everyone who remarked about the video quality, but please remember that many of these games are pretty old.  Just keep in mind that if it was the 10 best Rangers games, most would be radio only!

I'll treasure this collection, both on the DVDs and on my phone (ripped and converted for my Treo).

Bravo!!!",1238544000,,751,4.095890410958904
3688457,5,B001LPWGGO,"I purchased this for my Islander fan husband and he loved it!
This was well worth the price and since these are past games, you can give it as a gift for any occasion.",1238457600,,167,3.9411764705882355
3688458,5,B001LPWGGO,Recieved my DVD today from Amazon and it is excellent as a bonus the DVD comes with a voucher for 2 tickets to an Islander home game to be used between 3/3/09 thru 12/04/09...Great deal and a great price...,1237334400,,206,4.3076923076923075
3688459,4,B001LPWGGO,"Growing up during the dynasty, this set brought back some great memories. I too wish that there were more versions with the Islander announcers as well. It's also the same thing when they've shown a lot of the old games on their website. I don't know why that is.

I was also surprised the '80 cup winner game didn't have Nystrom's goal at the end of the second period. I've seen that on their web.

I guess I am getting a little picky but I still love it. With this team, they could have easily made a 20-DVD set. Maybe they will come out with a part two and include games like Parise OT in '75, Bossy's 50 in 50, Tonelli's winner against Colorado during the win streak, Game 1 vs Edmonton in '83, Bossy in mid-air in '82, Bourne's end-to-end game, a couple of the Capital games from '93, another Penguin game from '93 and game 6 against Toronto in '02",1236384000,,853,4.2592592592592595
3688460,5,B001LPWGGO,I would agree that some of the games are poor video transfers but that is something that has to be taken into consideration when some of these games are over 30 years old. They are bound to deteriorate.  But I think the crown jewel of this set and makes the set worth the purchase alone is the Easter Epic which is not just one of the best games in Islander History but one of the best playoff games ever.  It was a classic.,1236384000,,424,4.096385542168675
3688461,5,B001LPWGGO,"The ten games that will be on this set are:

1-1980 Cup Final, Game 6.  (CBC)
2-1981 Cup Final, Game 5.  (CBC)
3-Game 5 of 1982 Division Semi Finals vs Pittsburgh  (WOR)
4-1982 Cup Final, Game 4.  (CBC)
5-1983 Cup Final, Game 4.  (CBC)
6-Morrow's OT goal beats Rangers, 1984 Div. Semi Finals, Game 5.  (CBC)
7-The Easter Epic vs Washington, 1987  (CBC)
8-Volek's OT goal in Game 7 beats Pittsburgh, 1993  (CBC)
9-Bates penalty shot game vs Toronto, 4/24/2002  (ESPN2)
10-Al Arbour's 1500th win.  (MSG)

There are some problems. With just three exceptions all the games use the (Hockey Night In Canada Feed (CBC). You only get to hear Islanders' announcers Jiggs McDonald and Eddie Westfall in one game. (1982 Game 5 vs Pittsburgh) and the picture quality on that game is terrible.
Picture quality on most of the game is just fair to good. Even the Bates game fromm 2002 is sub par.
I actually have better copies of some of these games on VHS tape so I wonder why the quality could not have been upgraded on the DVDs.",1234310400,12,1016,4.521978021978022
8319336,5,B001LPWGGO,"I watch this set every summer since it was released.  Gets me through the off-season.  Sure, you can argue for other games being included with the set but for a team with such a rich history, you can't complain about much.  There are no games from the lean years (decades) and that's about right.  Also, remember that the Tavares Era is not represented since this set was released before he was on the team.

One game that would have been fun would have been the infamous ""Double Chili"" game vs the Rangers...but you can find that in other places if you know where to look.",1450137600,,573,4.419047619047619

8319341,1,B001LPWGGO,"I love the Islanders, and was excited to buy this set and see some of the classic games as well. But when I received the package, there were no discs inside at all. Just a bag of blue crystals with a thank you card from ""Los Pollos Hermanos"".",1364256000,,242,4.0625

8319343,4,B001LPWGGO,"As someone who grew up in New York and has watched the Islanders from almost their first game in 1972, I thought this was a good but not great set with a fair selection of games. Of course  disputes are inevitable in any ""10 greatest"" list, but my objections are:

The Islanders first big playoff push was in 1975, and there should have been at least one game from that year. The preferred games would be game 3 vs. the Rangers or game 7 vs. Pittsburgh. As I have never seen anything but short clips from these game since I saw them (or heard them on the radio)  live when they were played, I don't know that they still exist in complete form. They probably don't. I'm pretty sure nothing remains from the Rangers series but a 15 second clip of JP Parise's game 3 OT goal. If they don't,  some game from the Philadelphia series should be included. I have seen full game videos from this series and the absence of a 1975 playoff game is the most serious flaw in this set.

The second missing essential game is the winning streak record breaker vs. the Colorado Rockies. I was at that game in person and not only was it historic, it was a thrilling match with a wild finish. It's a crime this game wasn't included. Their winning streak record has since been broken, but when the Islander won their 15th straight, the record they erased went back to 1929 & it was a big deal.

For the more recent selections, I think it was right to include one game from the '02 series vs. Toronto, because that was one of the best, most intense early round playoff series I've ever seen. But they picked the wrong game. Game 6 was the best single playoff game the Islanders have had since their Stanley Cup years. This was the game after Michael Peca was injured on Darcy Tucker's cheap shot & the Isles were out for revenge & got it, at least temporarily. There were no penalty shots, but penalty shots are very overrated to this hockey fan, especially in comparison to a nasty 60 minute contest between two teams that hated each other.

In order to get these three games in, I'd drop the Al Arbour game & the Volek OT game & exchange game 6 in the Toronto series for game 4. The Al Arbour game was fun, but compared to games in the past when this team was winning cups, it falls short. I got the idea they included it because they wanted something recent for a team that has had little success in 20 years. Dropping the Volek game is a hard choice, but it was really a dead end for the Islanders while a '75 playoff game and the game vs. Colorado were of historic significance. There's one last game I'd like to see that goes way back in NYI history. In their first year, 1972-73, they played a wild game vs. the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins which they won I believe 9-7. This game was a fantastic result because the Islander won only 12 games that year and that one of them was vs. the great Bobby Orr Bruins, and that it was a 9-7 game made it one of the most unlikely occurrences in NHL history. I've seen some video of this game & if the entire game exists in video form, that it wasn't included in this set shows the lack of perspective suffered by those who put the set together. I'd like to give this set 3 1/2 stars coz it's better than 3 but not as good as 4, but I'll be generous. If it included at least one 1975 playoff game, I would give it five stars, but completely missing that truly important year is a bad flaw for a set like this.",1258848000,19,3449,4.2404870624048705
8319344,3,B001LPWGGO,"The first few games are very poor quality film. It would have been nicer to have more ""glitz"" regarding the pre game and after game. The quality of film gets better eventually, but not until 2000
Watching the Islanders is like traveling to the past and watching the greatest team to ever hit the ice. The Al Albour night game is fabulous and worth the price of the DVD.",1247443200,,369,4.36231884057971
