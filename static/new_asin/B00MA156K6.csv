6565545,5,B00MA156K6,"this tells the story of fidel castro through tv clips , interview segments and such.  It's very well done.  And we can see how Castro ,  lied and said he wasn't a communist and then took over and installed his communist state.  It ends with his stepping down from power in 2008.  His radical communist brother is now in control for now. Can the country survive the death of castro? probably , but I doubt it will survive the death of raul . but who knows?  after all it's been around for  56 years so far.  This shows how he went from popular leader to dictator , by just showing news footage basically.  It's a interesting video.  And it has a narrator that ties each news clip or newsreel together. . One thing you can say is that it's amazing that his family is still in power today. Long after most communist countries have fallen in Europe.",1427328000,,845,4.32484076433121
6565546,5,B00MA156K6,"VERY TRUE STORY...BUT IS IT COMPLETE?
I was very intrigued by this product when I first saw it advertised since I was there when it all happened, Although I was only a teenager the New Year's Eve that Batista defected, I clearly remember those first few years of the Revolution when I remained in Cuba. Yes, Castro is definitely a charismatic figure, and an intelligent one. I remember sitting in front of our television set for hours at a time hearing not several, but one speech. Some of the clips on this DVD were familiar to me but many were not. The missing element was that Castro wanted the populace to himself, he did not want to share the spotlight with anyone who might be more popular than he was. So early  on in his takeover, the then head of the military forces, Camilo Cienfuegos mysteriously disappears in his aircraft flying from east to west along Cuba's northern coastline. Cienfuegos was handsome, charismatic in his own way and very well liked by the Cuban population in general. Once he disappeared nothing else was ever mentioned about him, few efforts were made to find his plane. Then years later the infamous Che Guevara who had also gained in popularity is mysteriously murdered in Santa Cruz,Bolivia a small jungle town on the fringes of the Amazon. Once again, here was a popular man who fades from the picture without much effort being made to bring his assassins to justice. Overall I very much enjoyed this DVD but kept wondering why the part of his personality that we saw develop in real life, that it was he and only he that he wanted the populace to adore and revere and  he made sure that it remained that way was never mentioned",1414454400,4,1666,4.587248322147651
6565547,5,B00MA156K6,"THE FIDEL CASTRO TAPES evidence the most unbiased depiction of Castro which I have ever seen via any media presentation. It demonstrates clearly how the U. S. government, even liberal press and television have used propaganda to discredit him.",1410134400,4,243,5.256410256410256
6565548,5,B00MA156K6,"THE FIDEL CASTRO TAPES is a fascinating PBS documentary that contains a wealth of film clips, some not seen for decades.

The story of this charismatic leader is told from childhood. One of seven children, young Fidel attended Jesuit school. In 1952 he ran for Congress but before the actual election, Fulgencio Batista came to power. This is when Castro began organizing the resistance movement that some years later would oust Batista. He also served a year in prison prior to that triumph.

If the man could live forever there's little doubt he would rule Cuba in perpetuity. Of course there's anti-Castro Cubans, but many have left the country while those who remain must of necessity keep quiet for fear of harsh reprisals. Yet it's remarkable that a small island nation has a one-man socialist government for more than half a century that has outlived even Mother Russia (USSR). Fidel Castro, now well into his 80s, remains as its hero and standard bearer, even in supposed retirement.

The style of this documentary is ""quick edit,"" with the average film clip on screen for three seconds. But when more time is given to a single moment, such as a passionate Fidel harangue, therein lie the show's highlights. His oratorical skills were second to none, as we see here in many examples.

Most interesting is a 1/11/59 FACE THE NATION excerpt where Cuba's new Prime Minister answers an interviewer's question in halting English.

Early on, Fidel declared he was against ""all kinds of dictators,"" but we know how that resolve was abandoned. When Castro's alliance with the USSR  came about, President Eisenhower began the trade embargo against Cuba that remains in place to this day.

The April '61 Bay of Pigs invasion failed within 72 hours (reasons are given). We see clips of reports from back then of Cuban refugees landing on the Florida coast, and of course the Oct. '62 missile crisis is also explored. Highlight here is a Cuban newsreel report of the U.N.'s U Thant consulting with Fidel.

A 1974 newsclip shows a Cuba frozen in time, with ""mass mobilization and thought control"" suggested conclusions for the leader's long reign. Barbara Walters gets Castro to answer her in English. Senator George McGovern returns from Cuba and says Fidel believes he was targeted for assassination by the U.S. government. He also expresses regret over JFK's murder some years earlier.

In the late '70s Castro exported his brand of Marxism to Africa, where Cuban troops got involved in the Angola Civil War. A circa 1980 CBS report claims Fidel is softening in his middle years. Thus began the Mariel boatlift, which brought Castro's ""worms, bums, prostitutes, etc."" to American shores. On 1/5/84, President Reagan takes a hard line on Cuba.

Fidel's ""special period"" commences with the fall of the USSR in 1991. Five years later two Brothers to the Rescue planes are shot down off the island's coast by Cuban Air Force pilots. Four are killed. This brings new sanctions from the Clinton Administration.

The Elian Gonzales story is covered. Six-year-old Elian is eventually returned to his father in Cuba, much to the outrage of Miami's exile community.

Castro criticizes the 2000 election fiasco that ended with George W. Bush's victory. Bush responds with a call for free Cuban elections.

In 2006, Fidel's frail health is world news. Two years later, brother Raul becomes his country's new premier. Bush's hopes for a democratic Cuba prove fruitless. This is where the story ends, with Castro in semi-seclusion. The program's final clip has young freedom fighter Fidel claiming (in English) that he's not interested in becoming Cuba's president.",1409961600,7,3649,5.011570247933884
8671057,5,B00MA156K6,"Better than most documentaries out there on the subject. Fidel is a political enigma for sure. In regards to the subjectivity; it is hard to ascertain an unbiased truth, but this is a common theme with any controversial political matter. It is, none the less a seller educational film.
