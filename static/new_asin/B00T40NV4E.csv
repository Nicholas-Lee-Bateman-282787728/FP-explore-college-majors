8700190,5,B00T40NV4E,"The Globe Theater onScreen are so entertaining.  You feel lost as if you were there.  You can read a play, but seeing it done live in front of an audience you feel the play.  The actor's interaction with the audience is electric.  I highly recommend these videos.",1490486400,,263,4.531914893617022

8700192,2,B00T40NV4E,"I completely agree with another reviewer here that the pace of this production is breakneck, with actors racing through their lines.  The result is a lot of actors disconnected from one another, numbly barking their lines, seemingly trying to just get through it all.  Besides the hurried pace, the acting suffers from limited technical range and imagination, which results in monotony.  I'm afraid I wasn't able to make it past the first hour or so.",1440460800,4,450,4.973333333333334
8700193,4,B00T40NV4E,"This is an excellent production. Generally I have enjoyed the Shakespeare's Globe productions (there have been a few misses for me, like A Midsummer Night's Dream), and this is a great one.  Jamie Parker is a wonderful King Harry, just as he was a great Prince Hal in Henry IV, Part I (I have yet to see the Globe's Henry IV, Part II).  The rest of the cast is excellent; I single out Brid Brennan as the Chorus/Queen Isabel especially. I loved the audience involvement in the famous cry of ""God for Harry, for England, and Saint George!"" If I'd been there, I'd have been cheering along.  The only misstep for me was Act 1, Scene 1, mostly because I'm just not fond of bathroom humour, even as mild as shown here.  There are better ways to liven up an exposition scene.  The courtship of Harry and Princess Katherine was hilarious and sweet and touching.  I think Parker now ties with Branagh as my favourite Henry V.",1440288000,6,917,4.461077844311378
8700194,2,B00T40NV4E,"Although this production of Shakespeare's Henry V has several commendable elements (i.e. innovative and effective pantomime staging of battle sequences, good use of music on stage, several talented actors, etc.), it also has overwhelming serious flaws.  Almost every actor rushes through their lines as though they don't actually understand (or mean) the words that they are speaking, and the play has been presented as though Shakespeare intended it to be a British sit-com.  Although there are inherently some comic-relief elements in this work, the audience (high school students?) laughs at almost everything on stage, including things that aren't supposed to be funny.  But you can't blame the audience, given what they are seeing and hearing.  It really makes you wonder what the director and producers were thinking of, or at least what they thought they had read, in Shakespeare's work.

Princess Kate's lady-in-waiting is played by an actress doing a fair but annoying Tracey Ullman impersonation, Captain Fluellen is portrayed as a complete buffoon at all times - instead of the loyal detail-oriented stout-hearted Welsh soldier that he is, and King Harry shows less of the nascent maturity that the Bard may have intended this character to exhibit in this play.

There were a scant half-dozen times when it appeared that a few of the actors delivered not just lines, but a complete performance of the words and their meaning.  These moments stand out so conspicuously from the rushed and noisy delivery of the rest of the play that the viewer can scarcely help but notice the jarring contrast.  There are also several talented actors who take on 2-3 roles apiece during this play, and do so with such skill that you are never confused about whom they are portraying at any moment.  (You're not even sure that it's the same actor until the credits roll.)

The videography is beautiful, and the sound is good, but overall - you should definitely skip this one.  Most of it comes off like bad community theater.",1437436800,13,2019,5.033033033033033
8700195,5,B00T40NV4E,Wonderful production! Great acting beautiful sad great costumes. It was simply  the best!!,1431993600,8,90,5.923076923076923
8700196,5,B00T40NV4E,"I've been teaching the Bard for fifty years, seeing numerous presentation of this masterwork.  Jamie Parker is an ideal Hal.  I have never seen a production that has so much humor, yet maintains the integrity of the work.  I already own the Olivier and Branagh efforts,  among others which are excellent.

This has become my favorite.  I would not hesitate to recommend  it to anyone.  My students have all loved Henry V.  This version would be ideal
for those not familiar with Shakespeare.",1431043200,19,491,4.819277108433735
