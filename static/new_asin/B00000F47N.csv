7906589,5,B00000F47N,"I love this old VHS tape.  It's a series of interviews with various divas of the day talking about their lives and their art and what they did for love - of art.  The interviews are extremely insightful if you are interested in the lives of these people.  It's beautiful and sad and funny.  My favorite quote is Zinka Milanov saying ""You know the difference between me and Callas?  All of her husbands were rich!""  You'll need a tape player, but it worth it.",1425772800,,458,4.392857142857143
