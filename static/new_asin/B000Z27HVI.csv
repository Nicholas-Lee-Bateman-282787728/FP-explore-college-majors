8234660,4,B000Z27HVI,"it's really more of a MIG15 vs. F86 Sabre documentary.  Not that this makes it bad.  I did enjoy the info on MIG and F86 development as well as the pro vs con of the two aircraft as they fought over Korea.

There was a fair amount of discussion of what captured Sabre pilots (who returned at end of hostilities) faced in captivity.  I thought there could have been much more about the ""complete"" Korean war POW experience.  For example, one particular F-86 pilot Walker Mahurin, shown here on this program, was held captive for 16 months and endured much pressure/torture.  He made confessions to dropping insect canisters on N. Korea but immediately retracted upon return to US control.  He and some others were condemned publicly by Sen. Richard Russell, a senior member of the Senate who must have known of the US gov't (executive branch) boondoggling of forced repatriation of NK and Chicom prisoners.  This kept the war going for two more years, while the two sides haggled over POWs,  putting ours such as Mahurin at greater/longer risk of forced collaboration, as well as the Chinese/NK holding back several hundred prisoners in retaliation to the US letting some NK/Chicom prisoners stay in SK and Taiwan, respectively.

Later, Mahurin, a frontline fighter pilot of both WWII and Korea, was supposedly forced to retire just four years short of full retirement due to this condemnation by Russell.  The public never really knew the whole story at the time.  Prisoners like Mahurin suffered unjustly a bad reputation for being disloyal.  All, instead of a little, of this could have been included and make the program more interesting.

I also thought that Eisenhower was let off lightly for his abandonement of Korean war POWs.  There should have been more exposee of what he knew and did/didn't do for the return of all POWs.

Both of the afore-mentioned issues can/could be best learned in John M. G, Brown's massive Moscow Bound.  That book is the definitive account of what truly happened to Korean war (as well as other) POWs.  Actually, Moscow Bound gives the view of Korean War POW from mostly a high level viewpoint.  Another very good account of the Korean War POW experience is Name, Rank & Serial Num. by Charles Young.  This gives the plight of ground and pilot POW experience, kind of a lower level viewpoint.

Still, this dvd is worth buying and keeping",1381968000,,2374,4.826732673267327
8234661,5,B000Z27HVI,"Five stars for this DVD production from Nova. Very well narrated and laid out. Lots of unclassified info about the downed Sabre pilots during the Korean War including some that are still missing to this day.
This DVD also includes info on the Mig 15 and F-86 from the people who flew them, comparing these two amazing machines. Lots of actual footage and some that I had never seen before and interviews with people who fought in the war gives viewers a nice account of what it was like to fly the F-86s against the Migs. Highly recommended for those interested in the Korean war and/or Mig 15 and the Sabre.",1374192000,,608,4.486486486486487
8234662,5,B000Z27HVI,Saw this show on PBS and had to share it with my dad and uncle who are veterans.  Both really enjoyed it.,1269648000,2,105,3.772727272727273
8234663,4,B000Z27HVI,"NOVA's production of Missing in MiG Alley is a professionally produced, focused program on the pilots, aircraft, dogfights, and resulting aftermath of the air war portion of the Korean War (1950 - 1953).  The documentary covers the aircraft (the F-86 SABRE and the MiG-15 FAGOT) in detail, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the two designs, systems, armaments, etc.  The video also provides the dramatic details on the missing pilots, their families, and the international work to assemble the details of the remaining 31 missing-in-action (MIA) pilots.  The segment describes the use of Russian archives, Chinese museum information, and forensics lab DNA testing.  The video included interviews with Soviet, Korean, and U.S. fighter pilots, and a Soviet intelligence officer.  These interviews were especially interesting as they were highly effective in telling the story of the combat, the losses, the POW camps, and the quest for information on each others forces and technology.

Also included on the disc is a 9-page Teacher's Guide in Adobe .pdf format with some very interesting support information and activities for conducting classroom discussion and projects.

I would recommend this for history courses, Air Force ROTC and JROTC courses, Civil Air Patrol units, and regular war history buffs and aircraft aficionados.
