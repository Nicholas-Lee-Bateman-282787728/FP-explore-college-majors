8223422,5,B000WH5AXS,"Amazon.de asked me to send my review of a 'verified purchase' I made recently. I have waited several years before buying this dvd because I am always afraid of the faithful respect the Mrbisch productions have for the original form of the operettas they select since it has happened too many a time that the music seems a secondary element ... the importance is  to offer a  the super-show!  However this LAND DES LCHELNS is a beautiful performance where ... let me say this  even the usually horrible mikes on the faces of the interpreters are here not so fastidious as in other more recent productions. Here all is made with great honesty (there are - oh yes! - some useless changes, but the adaptors must obviously earn their useless work, mustn't they?) and Rudolf Bibl conducts with deep sensibility in a scrupulous adherence to the original musical score. The cast is good.  The ballet music is used here and there to give the audience the spectacular side which is a duty at Mrbisch. DAS LAND DES LCHELNS is a masterpiece and Lehar has given the musical theatre something so noble that it is impossible to find other ways to present it in forms that want to surprise with new aims ... the real surprise is to always listen to Lehar's music with renewed enthusiasm for the beauty that may enter in us.",1458691200,,1307,4.592274678111588
8223423,4,B000WH5AXS,"I have just watched this highly entertaining live recording and I must respectfully disagree with the earlier review.  I found Mr. Choi's
portrayal to be warm, sensitive and beautifully sung, with no sense of ""stiffness"" other than moments appropriate to his character. Ingrid Habermann is also excellent as Lisa, as is the rest of the fine cast.  Attractive sets and lavish costumes are a big plus. The Chinese dance troupe that performs the elaborate choreography is a great addition, as is the ""bonus"" of Lehar's Gold and Silver Waltz during the first act. Camerawork and sound are solid and successfully capture the special atmosphere of the Morbisch venue without losing any sense of being close to the drama. Highly recommended!!",1416441600,3,735,5.116666666666666
8223424,2,B000WH5AXS,"The Morbisch production is great as in all the others, However the main character sung by Sangho Choi is so stiff and with very limited arm movements that makes one think how can Lisa have been attracted to such a charmless character. I suggest to buy the movie that starred Rene Kollo in the main role. He may not be oriental looking, but the cast and the performances are great.",1306800000,6,380,4.442857142857143
