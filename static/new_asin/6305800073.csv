1071250,5,6305800073,"Congratulations to the filmmakers and financiers of this bold film, and also to the Academy for giving it prominence.
""Boys Don't Cry"" succeeds as a portrait not only of a sexual identity crisis but  simply as a portrait of one woman's compassion (Chloe Sevigny) for another  human being--it succeeds where ""My Own Private Idaho"" failed  because ""Boys"" is an aesthetically cohesive work of art.  Director Kimberly Pierce is astonishly gifted.  Her attention to detail,  composition, and her ability to use locations and static objects as  metaphors for what is transpiring in the minds and lives her her characters  is remarkable.  The editing is also another noteworthy feature (although  the use of flashbacks in Act III is unnecessary and detracts from one of  the film's most powerful scenes).
Although Hilary Swank is undeniably  amazing, it is the character played by Chloe Sevingny that gives this film  its emotional resonance.  Her role is not a supporting role but a lead  role--in fact she is technically the protagonist (undergoes classic  character change)and has nearly as much screen time as Swank.  Sevingny's  performance is absolutely brilliant.
One warning:  I walked into this  film unaware of how disturbing it would be and was blindsided.  This is a  gritty, no holds barred film about a sensitive subject.
Although I doubt  this was Kimberly Pierce's primary intent, the film also stands as a  powerful argument in favor of hate crime legislation.  There is an  emotional plea for tolerance at the core of this movie, and people on the  political fence may find that this film moves them in the direction of  conceding that hate crimes comprise a separate category.",954201600,68,1688,5.106617647058823
1071251,5,6305800073,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is the most phenomnial movie that I've ever seen.
I saw this movie in a tiny upstairs theater in Ashland, Oregon, and was thoroughly shaken and impressed when I walked out.
""Boys Don't  Cry"" is the story of a girl who is posing as a boy because that is  what makes her the most comfortable with herself and with the way she wants  to live. The story takes place in a small town where she (the character's  name is Teena Brandon, played by Hilary Swank) meets and falls in love with  a girl who lives there while posing as a male. It's based on a true  story... and it's phenomnial. The budget for the movie was something like  $2 million, which is SMALL for a current day film, and it was beautifully  done.
The movie is just about the trials that Teena as Brandon goes  through as guy... the people he interacts with, how he has to deal with  things as a man...and how comfortable it is. It's also about love... The  love of the girlfriend's family who ""adopts"" Brandon when they  get together... the way Brandon and his new friends intereact... what  Brandon does to get accepted... and the love between Brandon and his new  girlfriend.
The movie is about relationships.  It is about the love and  friendship and all of the joys and sorrows that come with the choices that  are made.
Unfortunatly, this movie has been tagged with a lot of  sexuality and gender biases, which may very well keep some people from  seeing it. In almost every review you read you will find terms like  ""Transgender"", ""Lesbian"" or ""Homosexuality"".  It's true, those issues do come up in this movie.  But if you are capable  of sitting in the theater and watching without outwardly sneering or being  crude due to your homophobia, then I recommend seeing this movie.
I keep  trying to put the experience of seeing this movie into words, and I find  that I just can't.  You need to see it for yourself. All I can say about it  is that I saw it a week and a half ago, and it is almost all that I have  thought about since.  I honestly believe that this movie will change you  and how you view the world.  It certainly changed me.
Like I said before,  this is the most phenominal film that I have ever seen. I highly recommend  it.",953856000,16,2224,4.383292383292384
1071252,2,6305800073,"I got a picture of how Bradon is portrayed in Boys Don't Cry. But I wonder how he/she is.
I don't know the true Bradon and I can't say if he/she has gender identity disorder who needs a sex-change surgery. Even if it's so,  it's nothing about ""mentally screwed up"". Bradon was who he/she  was. He/she knows what he/she wants -- a surgery, Lana and life -- maybe  more.
The movie is technically good. The editing, composition and rythm.  But I doubt how much the director understands Bradon or the way she deals  with how Bradon is portrayed.
Is the true Bradon really both a lesbian  and a transgender? What else? Bradon is portrayed only as a lesbian and a  transgender. Queers have their lives beside their ""queer  matters"". Queers have families and friends. Queers are not  queer-only.
Please also beware female masculinity does not equate gender  identity disorder.
The pain as a transgender is not seen in the movie.  It's not funny or anything about sex appeal in a movie to see Bradon puts  the fake pennis in his/her pants. It's about someone's self image. It's  about someone who wants and are brave enough to be oneself.
I hate the  what's-a-dyke scenes -- bathing and having period -- to portray the  ordinary as extra-ordinary.",953769600,6,1239,4.6976744186046515
1071253,5,6305800073,"""Boys Don't Cry"" was one of the most emotionally gripping films of this past year.  Hillary Swank has already won the Golden Globe and every other major film critics award for Best Actress (i.e. New York, L.A.  and Chicago Film Critics, etc.) and she certainly deserves all the  recognition she's receiving.  Her performance as the doomed Brandon Teena  is riveting.  Combining a sweet akwardness and shy vunerability is what  makes Swank's performance so compelling.  She is definitely my favourite to  win on Oscar night.  And if she does win l would just like to say to all  those skeptics out there who doubted her talent, ""I told you so.""  Equally compelling is her co-star, Chloe Sevigny, who portrays Brandon  Teena's girlfriend.  The two have some amazing scenes together which  display the raw talent of each of their award-winning performances.  Even  though this is a small, independent film, l believe it needs to be seen by  a larger audience.  Go see the film if you haven't already.  Be warned that  the film does take a dark, violent turn near the end but l guarantee you  you will most definitely be left feeling the powerful impact of this  true-life story.",953683200,17,1175,4.8232323232323235
1071254,5,6305800073,"I have turned into ""movie reviewer Kate!"" I have seen quite at few movies at the Cinemas (which is odd for me cause I used to never really enjoy Cinema now I do, maybe it's cause what I was usually dragged to see was  crap, and was not about acting, merely creating a box office hit) lately  like Melbourne's Premiere of The Green Mile, were I ran into two famous  people (Peter Brock and a Neighbors actor), then later I saw an Australian  film called The Wog Boy, which was really funny,  took the piss out of all  Australian's, but in a good way. If you have ever been to or lived in any  big Australian city or met any ""New Australians"" then I recommend  this movie that was shot right here in Melbourne which is very subtlety  advertised through the whole movie, from shot of well known spots in the  background, not to mention the Vicrtoian number plates sporting the famous  Victorian saying ""Victoria-On the move"".
  But one movie  stands out in my mind that I happen to see in St Kilda yesterday. The event  wasn't completely planned. I was just SO HOT  (It was almost 40 degrees in  the sun!) that I was willing to pay $9.50 for 2 hours of decent air  condioning, and i got it, as well as a movie  that i didn't expect to be so  brilliant. It is called ""Boys Don't Cry"", and is written and  directed by  Kimberly Peirce staring Hilary Swank  (90210, Buffy) and Chlo  Sevigny (The last days of Disco) who filled their incredibly demanding  roles superbly.
With me and my strange quite urban anti Hollywood all  for Independent Films taste these movie rate with stuff like In The Name of  the Father,Pulp fiction, Basket Ball Diaries, Train Spotting and even the  New Zealand production staring Kate Winslet (Titanic) before see went  Hollywood there was Heavenly Creatures. (I hear she is back in an  independent film though, shot in India were she plays Australian girl!)
  That is not to say this movie is any thing like those movies I mentioned.  It is TOTTALLY different. The only thing it has in common with In  In The  name of the Father is the way it made me feel through and after it. It made  me angry, sad, compassionate, shocked and uncomfortable (only a good film  does this!), most of all it changed  the way I think about some things. It  broaden my horizons you could say.
I must warn some spectators before  they see it, that it is a story of a girl from southern American state that  believes she is suppose to be a boy and there fore dresses in cross gender.  And actually dates girls, as they believe she is a boy. The story line is  very different and dares to tackles a touchy very serious subject head on.  (But I could say this movie conceptis more easily digested then the  Australian film ""Head On"" staring Alex Dimitriatedes that is about  Beats)(If you do not know what a beat is then don't ask!)
  But the  thing is that if you get past cringing at homosexual kissing (if that does  make you cringe?) Then you get close to the main characters, actually like  them, as the director intended to portray them as real breathing innocent  people and show the way they lived, after all it is based on a true story.
  I say if you choose to see this powerful movie then go in with an open  mind and your mind and it might open your eyes.
  To those who condone  disrrimaintion I will be interested to know if after watching this movie if  you still condone discrimination and taunting against people who are  ""different"". If you still do then I do not believe that you have  a heart, in fact I find it hard to believe you are a human being.
  I  must say that I walked out of that cinema thanking god that is was not my  reality, but I couldn't forget that it is a lot of people's realities. And  that can be a hard, cold and lonely one.
  Remember ""expect nothing and  you shall receive"" is my motto when it comes to seeing a new film.  Feel free to email me at pxe_341@yahoo.com.au for feedback, or to share  your opinions.  Cheers!  By Kate;) Stanborough",953078400,19,3987,4.385144429160936
1071255,5,6305800073,"This is an excellent film, however the subject is heart wrenching.  The film isn't about a girl masquerading as a man or about a confused lesbian. These terms have unfortunately been equated with the film and are  inaccurate.  Brandon was an FTM, a transgendered person/transexual who was  pre-op. The film does deal with Brandon's affirmation of his  (yes--editors-HIS)true SELF (read Jung).  Chloe Sevigny portrays a young  woman who is able to see beyond the physical and into Brandon's true SELF.  Unfortuately, 2 disturbed men, who have many issues in themselves, in their  limited vision and supposed masculinity are challenged by Brandon's  transgenderness.  They project their own insecurities out on  Brandon--brutally raping and murdering Brandon, a young mother, and an  African American (not shown in the film).  Warning: this film is  emotionally upsetting and demonstrates the issue of violence on many  levels--all folks can relate.  In many respects, this film ranks on the  levels of Schlinder's List and Platoon.  Please make sure you see the film  with someone so you can talk afterwords. Trust me, I conducted a panel  after a showing of the film for an audience of 40-50 individuals.  Let the  pain in and feel it.  It's the only way you can truly understand the  film.
It's too bad that Kimberly Peirce was not nominated for an Academy  Award for her direction. The film is EXCELLENT!",952128000,84,1406,5.083700440528634

1071257,4,6305800073,"Teena Brandon was one mentally screwed up girl.  From her wrestling with her sexuality (denying she was a lesbian) and her self-destructive reckless attitude towards the law. Hillary Swank gives a very brave performance  which as tragic as the character is, it's a refreshing change from the  cliched ""TOOTSIEish"" portrayals of people who may ot seem a part  of ""everyday"" society.  I personally think Swank still looked  rather feminine, but, hey, she IS a woman!  Her Nebraska accent and  mannerisms are excellent.  Chloe Sevigny gives an equally brave performance  in her own right as the object of Swank's affections.  This film will  propel both to the forefront in Hollywood-at least it SHOULD. What a 180  degree turn from ""the Next Karate Kid"" for Swank!  Too bad the  film distributor, Fox Searchlight, seemed too timid to release this  excellent film to a wider audience.  Oh well, I guess that's why video was  created.",951609600,8,930,5.006578947368421

1071328,4,6305800073,"Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of transgender teen Brandon Teena. I watched the movie up until the part she is going to be beaten and raped and stopped at that point.
Its a true story that is sad and dark. Brandon is passing himself off as a boy and getting away with it pretty good despite his size. He really is a guy-in his head and acts like one 24/7.
Even his girlfriends have no idea until later in the movie that he is a she.
Because of all the scientific studies done we are whatever we're going to be at birth. Trans people do exist just as straight and gay people do and as such they deserve to be treated with respect.
Back in 1993 when this actually happened it was a lot harder to be gay or transgender. I'm sure its no picnic now, but its gotten better for them.
All the actors were very real-maybe too real in their roles.
The movie left me depressed honestly and even though I try and think of myself as a liberal enlightened woman it was hard for me to watch the sex scenes knowing it was two females.
What bothered me are all the reviews spouting God and hate-why did they even watch the movie. They should crawl back to their safe conservative right wing homes and block out anything that offends them.
I recommend this with hesitation. Graphic violence is hard for me. If you can handle it and a fantastic performance by Hillary Swank-rent or stream or buy the movie.",1492214400,,1407,4.313207547169811

Lana was my fav, she still loved Brandon no matter what and I truly felt like their love was genuine. Before I watched the film I read that John was Lana's boyfriend. I didn't get that vibe watching the film. I kind of felt like John was obsessed with Lana and he hated the fact that Brandon had what he wanted. A true hater in my eyes. I feel horrible about the fact that they also took Candace's life. Just a bunch of cowards. Nobody deserves death because of what they feel they truly are. Unfortunately, at the time of Brandon's death in 1993, most people were close minded to transgender life and I believe we still are to this day but there is more acceptance for it now than there was in 1993.",1468540800,,1018,4.252577319587629

This movie was about someone just being who they are - no complexity, not deep, not in-your-face - but still delivers some very profound messages. There is an innocence about it where it feels like such a relief for the character to finally be himself for the first time in his life, but also innocence that can't even envision the hate, negativity, and evil that exists, therefore leaving him incredibly vulnerable. You end the movie thinking about what you admire about Hilary Swank's character, almost inspired to be yourself and take chances.

1071515,5,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry is a heartland tale of a soul too otherworldly to convincingly assimilate himself in the homogenised Midwestern USA. His name was Brandon Teena and he was born a she. Brandon's rocky past and penchant for trouble propels him like a moth to a flame into Falls City, where ennui is a way of life. The locals tend to drink or use drugs to overcome mind-numbing boredom, ultimately ending up mind numbingly high. Brandon, however, sees this newly discovered world as a temporary abode and a fun place to live at that. He can act out his repressed fantasies by assuming the role of a tough, brooding hearthrob not unlike James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. This person, ""Brandon"", has been within him for a long time and a promising new town has given him the ability to write a new chapter of his life, one where he can fulfil his own personal freedom. He soon meets the ethereal and perpetually bored (but equally beautiful) Lana. It doesn't take long for these two to fall for each other, as Lana see's Brandon as her one-way ticket out of her dead end existence in Falls City. In Lana, Brandon see's everything that he loves about women, a rose among thorns. There is so much going on behind Lana's hooded eyes that it's hard for us not to fall in love with her, too. Things go awry when Lana's ex-boyfriend, a jailbird named John Lotter, discovers Brandon's true biological gender with the help of Brandon's friend Candace and his pal Tom Nissen. Lana and Brandon make plans to leave the town, and the film turns into a love-on-the-run tale pretty quickly. For that reason, it is comparable to many Midwestern love story-cum-road movie tragedies like Badlands, At Close Range and Monster. The road or highway becomes a figurative location in the sense that it conveys a crossroads for these characters, a portal into a better life and a pivotal symbol for freedom that cannot be found in small town USA. Of course, things turn dark very quickly and the newly aquatinted couple fall victim to old fashion ignorance, contempt and small-town hatred.

What elevates Boys Don't Cry above the usual American crime film or by-the-dozen doomed love story is the performances and the ability to empathise and even relate to the characters - even in a story as singular, isolated and bizarre as this, these lives still ring true. Hilary Swank is unforgettable and the praise for her performance has been deservedly unanimous. Every nuance is conveyed so perfectly... you can see the aching in her face, the longing to be who you really feel you are, but with the looming possibility of rejection. Chloe Sevigny (as the open-minded, rose among thorns girlfriend and the only real moral compass of the film) is also extraordinary. In fact, her performance is on par with Swank's. She gives the film a heart, a soul and most importantly provides the key into this otherwise unwelcoming world. If it wasn't for her, the film would be nowhere near as accessible. Saving removes the smouldering haze from our vision and provides us a personal connection to an otherwise gritty story. Love is always hard, especially in the face of ignorant onlookers who cannot feel the same feelings we feel. In this case, it's going to cost somewhere their life. The direction here is also superb, with a lot of personal flourishes giving the film a unique look. The use of time lapse photography, frequent shots of highways and the interesting use of lighting (the foreboding street lights, the shadowy interiors) convey the story in a strikingly dreamlike haze that is equally threatening and painstakingly beautiful. It is integral to a story like this, about characters who inhabit the night and secrets that lurk behind closed doors.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the Blu-ray of this film, having seen it many times on both VHS and DVD. This is certainly the best it has looked, although it probably could look better. The special features aren't anything new unfortuantely, but the old commentary by director Kimberly Pierce is always enlightening to listen to. A retrospective feature on a potential anniversary release might be nice. I've always thought this would be a prime Criterion title. It is hard to believe it's almost been 16 years since this film premiered. I highly recommended it to people who have not yet seen it or to anyone familiar with the very tragic story of Brandon Teena, on which this film is based. If you want a deeply enriching film experience, check this out. It is an uncompromisingly difficult viewing experience, but it has so much to offer culturally, socially, morally and artistically.",1448928000,,4616,4.819672131147541

1071664,5,6305800073,"A great film that delivers on quite a few different fronts. It takes a subject that most of us can't relate to, and turns it into something we can all relate to. Along the way, it raises provocative, highly intelligent questions about gender, sexuality, and a variety of other topics. The protagonist is refreshingly painted, highly flawed, and extremely sympathetic. Everything about the film is first rate, except for the end, which takes the story into a strange and different dimension. The director says she was trying to be faithful to the facts, but from a story perspective it doesn't work. Two of the characters are revealed at the end to be crazy--complete psychopaths. While this may be true to life, it serves as a kind of ""Pluto ex machina,"" that sends the story over a cliff. Never mind. If it bothers you, don't watch the last 30 minutes. The film is great, without the ending.",1435795200,,892,4.7243589743589745

I have two problems with it though: Hilary Swank was chosen to play the character who is a young trans man, and she played this part compassionately and believably. She was excellent. Her love interest, a ""cis female"" was played by Chloe Sevigny. Why, on God's green earth, was Chloe Sevigny chosen? Aren't there, I don't know, 200 or so other female actors who would have done just as well? Chloe Sevigny, with the exception of Tori Spelling, is one of the most masculine looking actresses facially that exists. Why juxtapose the female lead, playing a trans man, with the manly Chloe Sevigny? All it did, for me, was make Hilary Swank less believable when the two were in close proximity. Swank as the trans man appeared much MORE feminine next to Sevigny's brutish features. It took away from Swank's persona. The second issue, which is my issue, is that I could not sympathize too much with Brandon, who had a knack for causing his own problems (forging checks, starting bar fights, stealing cars, lying to response to people's kindness, speeding, fleeing from cops, evading court appearances, underage drinking, crashing with parolees, etc etc etc).  Flying with crows gets you shot down with crows. Still, Swank was excellent at evoking what empathy I was able to  feel.",1428710400,3,1304,4.86936936936937

Very realistic in its portrayal of a subculture of misspent youths that knew nothing other than a transient, drifting from pillar to post, seeing life as short, living for the moment and make the most of the time you've got, but devoid of any real ambition other than hard drinking, dive bars and drag racing. Teena Brandon, the central protagonist with a sexual identity complex; and Lana seemed to be the only characters that wanted more out of life than muscle cars and honky-tonks. There is a lot of heavy drinking, as you can see, involved with the collective backwoods-y group  (I believe this is Lincoln, Nebraska; but it's every bit as redneck-y as a similar culture in Alabama or Georgia). This portrayal of Teena Brandon, her life and people in it, is gritty, there is no sentimentality, it is violent at times; this is the harshness of life in a small town isolated from culture and progressive thinking. It's definitely a film for those with maturity and a certain level of understanding of the human condition. Why is there so much ugliness in the world? Why do we allow hate or prejudice to exist?

From the outside looking in - my former spouse is transgender and in order to live as a woman felt she had to leave despite still loving me. She did not understand my desire as a heterosexual woman to stay married because I loved the person, not the parts.

Other reviews have more successfully analyzed the acting and filming than I could. The acting, script, and filming are done so well. This film will hit you right in the gut. My review is simply to say if you are a person who has a loved one or family member or friendship with someone who is transgender, watch this film as it will also give you insight into yourself. If you have a friend like me, watch and hopefully it will help you understand me better.",1405382400,,881,4.307228915662651

Her heart and soul, as a born girl, living her life as a boy, is beyond convincing,. She leaves no doubt that she is a boy,  and intends to live her life that way. A few disturbing scenes brings the depth of this true hate crime violence to life. You almost feel as though you're one of the characters in the movie, forced to pick a side, helping,  or ridiculing and bullying.

She was stupid to hook up at seedy bars and hang with drugged out ex-con rednecks. Of course she was going to get killed. I found it difficult to sympathize when she kept making horrible choices.

This could have been improved if she would cleanly come to terms with the fact she's lesbian, and NOT a boy.

Can you do it without getting a slap on  the back or recognition for having done it day in day out? Being a man is a very amorphous idea and can and often does mean different things to men and even women of different walks of life and status.

It is disturbing how society in general doesn't accept people based on their sexuality. Teena Brandon was a transgender. She identified with being a male although she was born female. She was raped and badly beaten and the cop questioning her seemed more interested in her sexuality than the crime itself. Some of this was disturbing to watch and more so because it is true. I'm not going to spoil the movie if you haven't seen it yet. But if your interested in watching a ""hate ""crime movie then this is for you. Teena Brandon tried to hide her identity but I think it was because of all the negativity that surrounded her.

1072907,3,6305800073,"Hilary Swank won a much-deserved Oscar for her portrayal here of Teena Rae Brandon, a young woman living with gender dysphoria, who for the last years of her life lived as a man under the name of Brandon Teena before she was brutally murdered by two young men. The performance of Swank and other actors in this film is compelling. This film certainly humanizes the complex and widely misunderstood plight of woman and men like Teena Brandon who are forced to live not only with vilification and threats from many around them, but who must ever minute of every day confront the reality that their own bodies are a living mockery of how they conceptualize themselves and their place in the world. If art is a creative endeavor that enables someone to come closer to the inner world and experiences of another, than this is indeed one of the rarest things to come out of Hollywood -- a real piece of art.

As evident from many of the reviews here, this film a has become an occasion for polemics and gender identity politics among some, for displays of misinformation and confusion among others, and for both by yet others. But one need not accept any of the usual claims about issues of gender identity and gender dysphoria to relate to the human tragedy behind Teena Brandon's life and death as depicted in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Remember that the classic definition of tragedy is not merely the unfolding of a sad event; it is the inevitability of disappointment, defeat and ultimately death as innate parts of the human experience that none of us can avoid. From that point of view this film, and Teena Brandon's life, are tragedies we can all relate to.",1358467200,,1650,4.6506849315068495

1072983,3,6305800073,"This had a lot of terrible violence, which was an actual recreation of something tragic that happened, yet it was morbid and unhappy and left me with a bad feeling. There was not one thing I could hang onto that was hopeful or uplifting. Had I known it was full of scenes of someone getting brutally raped and beaten over and over again I wouldn't have watched it.
It is not my kind of movie.

I do admire Hillary Swank and no one could have pulled off this transformation into a male better. Unfortunately there were far too many gratuitous scenes of her naked, bleeding, bruised and beaten, alternating with scenes of her naked, and having other people's hands all over her face and body and hair alternating with scenes of people pulling her clothes off. Did I say gratuitous?

Spoiler alert, stop reading if you don't want to know the story...

A certain Texas impoverished redneck trailer park mood was created and it was easy to see from the time we saw the two disgusting backwoods thugs that something horrible would happen to Brandon when they found out he was really a she. The rapes and beatings toward the end came as no surprise.

Violence, drinking, stints in jail, self destructive urges and acts, and a slightly built young woman running around pretending to be a boy and having sex with the girls is a recipe for disaster in this sorry town.

Brandon had a winning grin and very warm smile which rarely left his face, and huge ultrawhite teeth and very full lips that I have not seen on any men,
along with a tiny neck and no adam's apple, but these people were a little dim and didn't notice anything amiss with Mr. Brandon as long as he partied and got drunk with them every night. If Brandon were in most towns he would be regarded with deep suspicion I think.

Brandon was very clevor about the sex act with his girlfriend. She couldn't even tell it wasn't the real McCoy. And when she finally saw Brandon in the women's jail and he/she admitted to being a ""hermaphrodite"" she couldn't care less what Brandon was, she was just so in love. The brutes who killed him probably would have found another victim to kill at some point. Brandon was a convenient excuse to exercise some pent up aggression.

I gave it three stars for the acting, particularly Miss Swank's, but left off two stars for the horrific scenes and constant pawing at the nude body of the transgendered girl. Clearly she would never leave this hellaceous town alive. This movie was well done yet very predictable and as gratuitous as they come at the same time. I could have done without seeing it personally.

I would expect it to be told differently, in a more normal daily life way, and it could make the argument more powerful regarding a girl wanting to be a boy ending up in death. it seems all the other charactors besides Teena are already troubled souls (simple mothers, fights in the bars, getting theirselves in trouble all the time, making silly decisions etc). This makes me wondering if this is really the case in the middle America which I know little about (would appreciate if someone tells me).  If this is the case, brutal crimes would be there with or without Teena.

1072989,5,6305800073,"I had purchased this move a while back, waiting to be in the right mood and frame of mind to watch it. All I really knew going in was it was a very good and very intense movie. This is by far the most violent film I've ever ""viewed"" - by that I mean couldn't stop watching but had to fast forward through the most violent of parts. I have no idea how this film is not NC 17. By all standards, this is an adult movie. Though the sex/violence in the film was not gratuitous. It was appropriate and needed to tell the story.

This film is a tragic romance/drama about 20 year old Brandon who is tough, thrill seeking, brave, nurturing, beautiful, and sweet. Brandon lives in a girls body and fully identifies as being a boy with no parents, no job, no money, and no way to transform the exterior self to match the internal perception. And instead resorts to breast binding and rolled socks in the pants. The film starts out with Brandon living with an older relative who loves and is concerned about Brandon, but is fed up and kicks Brandon out, after Brandon runs into the house locks the door, and hits the floor, with an angry gang of young men chasing closely behind screaming threats and breaking windows. All the while Brandon is grinning at the thrill of it. The tension in this film starts out high, then escalates throughout.

Brandon ends up going to a bar, meets a girl, and bonds with her two male companions over a bar fight. Brandon latches onto the trio, tags along to their small town a hundred miles away, and happily becomes a part of their highly dysfunctional households. This is the first time Brandon, who is rather naive and lacks self preservation skills, has ventured from his home town of Lincoln, Nebraska. One of the men, John, a thrill-seeker like Brandon, but also an unstable drug addict with bouts of violence, takes Brandon under his wing as a kind of mascot. When Brandon becomes enamored with Lana, who John is extremely possessive about, things get complicated. And when Brandon's many deceptions are uncovered, ugly.

This film was perfectly cast, with superb performances all around. The actresses portraying the two main characters in this film (Hillary Swank as Brandon and Chloe Sevigny as Lana) were academy award winners/nominees. Huge amounts of research and filming technique went into this film (amazing cinematography) which is worth checking out after watching the film.

Post Script - One small issue with the film was that there was a scene in which Lana was present and her presence didn't seem to make sense. I assumed it must have been what actually happened, but later found she was in fact not there at that time. The film would have been even better if that one aspect had been more realistically rendered.",1315526400,2,2759,4.6359918200409

At that point I already hated the 2 guys so when they raped Tina Brandon, I wanted to skip past the scene.  Actually I ended up hating the entire family including the mother because they were poor white trash and totally incompassionate.  This was an interesting story and there wasn't a dull moment.  I almost wanted to cry at the end when the cop was interviewing Tina Brandon, and she told him the reason why she was doing what she was doing was because of sexual identity crisis.",1303862400,,737,4.587786259541985

The acting was great (Hilary Swank and especially Chloe Svigney) and the story was interesting, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the movie's director. The characters were either all good, or all bad and I didn't think anything in the movie was presented objectively.

Brandon, despite having many prior arrests (and mental illness?) was never presented as anything other than good, albeit confused. When you boil the person down, what was Brandon besides a liar? Help was available for her, but she didn't want it. Despite her feelings toward everyone, all she did in the end was lie to them. Granted, she had a reason to lie, but why wasn't anyone hurt by her lies, especially Lana?

And what was the deal with the accents? This was Nebraska, not Texas, but everyone was talking with a really strong southern accent.

The rape scene was horribly brutal and the sex scenes were pretty hot, but for me this was just a depressing movie about some very sad and depressing people and not nearly as well written as another very sad and depressing movie about sad and depressing people: Midnight Cowboy.

I also don't know what urgent social issues the movie explored. Gay hate crimes? Yeah, for maybe ten minutes out of the whole movie. Homosexuality? Not that I ever saw. Gender issues? Again, not that I ever saw.

The plot follows Brandon as ""he"" enounters a lot of trailer trash-type individuals, and the story concludes with Brandon being raped by two men who he associated with who learned Brandon was actually a girl. These two men eventually murder Brandon. The film is harrowing, yet truthful and is one of those rare American movies that shows the hatred against those that are different or are perceived to be abnormal. The film broke during the time Matthew Sheppherd was murdered, and as a result many were curious to view ""Boys Don't Cry"". Hilary Swank desevedly received the Oscar in 1999 for Best Actress in a Motion picture. For those who enjoyed ""Boys Don't Cry"" NBC released ""The Matthew Sheppherd Story"", so if you happen to come across it on televison viewings I would suggest in watching it: it too is an excellent film about the hatred that gays can be faced with. That film has never been put on DVD yet.
 ""Boys Don't Cry"" was an independent film that found its way into the mainstream through word-of-mouth. It costs over two million to make but grossed over $11,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD comes with an excellent commentary by the director of the movie.",1244764800,,1370,4.780590717299578

In this film, I have discovered a story that is powerful, moving and inspirational.

Hillary Swank played the role of Brandon Teena, a transgendered teenager struggling for acceptance, with such gusto that it is little surprise she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role.  Her portrayal of Brandon was believable and seemed to me to be on-target.  Swank is aided by a phenomenal cast whose performance bring to life the many complicated emotions in this story.

The story itself is important.  Transgendered individuals and the transgender experience are underrepresented in our cultural literacy.  Along with films, such as TransAmerica, Boys Don't Cry puts a human face on transgender issues and gender dysphoria.

1073083,4,6305800073,"Brandon Teena (born Teena Brandon) was a young transgendered female-to-male. Brandon was brutally murdered in 1993. Hilary Swank does a phenomenal and Oscar-winning job of recreating the end of Brandon's life.

This is a dark, and profoundly distressing film. Even if Brandon's life story were not known, it could be surmised by this brief recitation of facts: A young transgendered girl is born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and upon leaving home sets out for---an insular rural town.

The real tragedy of Brandon's life is that Brandon might have found far more acceptance in an anonymous large city, like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, or even Chicago. Instead, Brandon exhibited a tendency toward poor choices (including busts for check fraud); settling in a one-stoplight town whose younger inhabitants had the limited horizons brought on by chronic unemployment, heavy drinking, petty crime, meth addiction, and violent boredom, was a fatal mistake.

Brandon suffered from the same myopia. At one point, Brandon discusses with friends the ambition of owning a trailer park. Despite Brandon's very unorthodox identity, Brandon's imaginative worldview was dreary.  Instead of seeking out similar peers, Brandon chose friends whose natural tendency was to have the narrowest outlook.

Truly benighted, two of Brandon's friends raped and beat Brandon when they discovered Brandon's physical identity. After Brandon reported the attack, the two men were brought in for questioning, but were not charged (the local Sheriff referred to Brandon in death several times as ""It""). After their release, they killed Brandon.

Swank plays Brandon sympathetically, but not without acknowledging some serious flaws of character. The miserable atmosphere of this film is its own indictment.

It is truly troubling that anyone would choose to kill a person like Brandon ""just because"" Brandon was who Brandon was. As sad as the unneccessary death of Brandon was, the environment that spawned such an event is even more sorrowful, especially since it simply doesn't have to be so.",1234742400,3,2073,5.419254658385094

1073223,5,6305800073,"`Boy's Don't Cry' is the type of film that will prove it's title wrong, displaying enough emotional despair to make the burliest of men break down in tears.  Recounting the true life story of Teena Brandon, a young woman with a sexual identity crisis that lived her life as Brandon Teena and was eventually raped and murdered in 1993, `Boy's Don't Cry' hits every mark precisely and delivers one of the most well proportioned films in recent years.  Director Kimberly Pierce masterfully achieves accuracy and authenticity with levels of unique elegance and sets a mood that is piercingly calm while subtly unnerving.  Watching this young woman's life slowly spiral out of control is so tempered and paced that it almost creeps up on you despite the fact that it's been unraveling quite rapidly before your very eyes.

The heart and soul behind this tragic retelling is that of Hilary Swank who delivers a brilliant breakout performance in which she disappears within the skin of Teena or better yet Brandon and completely convinces the audience of her lies, deceiving us as much as she's deceiving her fellow cast mates.  Swanks performance is so brutally convincing that the viewer is swallowed in her frustration, her pain and her confusion.  We are completely attached to her and never want to let her go.  Swank is not alone though for the entire supporting cast is spot on as well, most notably Chloe Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard who command their scenes and our emotions.  Chloe plays Lana, Brandon's love interest.  Her innocence and naivety makes her understandable, but it's her compassion in the heat of crashing hope that makes her lovable and sympathetic.  I wept almost more for her character than that of Swank herself.  Sarsgaard's character John evokes in us a drastically different emotional response.  John, Lana's ex-boyfriend and Brandon's supposed friend is unsympathetic, irrational, violent and controlling and as we watch Peter Sarsgaard create and manipulate his own performance we're forced to appreciate his genius.  His performance is utterly flawless.

As Teena's story is told we are brought to an understanding and or appreciation for the lives and or trials of others.  Teena is not much different than the rest of us, a confused young girl who did all that she could to be who she knew she was regardless of the gender card she was dealt.  We all struggle in our own ways to become the person we know we are yet never are given to opportunity to unveil and so watching her determined struggle should give us all a sense of respect for this brave young woman.  As tragic as this biopic is it's a film that we should all experience and learn from.

Watching Swank, Sevigny and Sarsgaard chew up their performances before our eyes is fascinating to watch, three young actors devouring these characters with a mature fervor that is hard pressed to find in some of our more advanced and experienced actors.  Swank earned the Oscar she won for this and Sevigny, as much as I adored Jolie in her respective film, deserved the Oscar as well for her heartbreaking performance.  The fact that Peter Sarsgaard was snubbed altogether of a nomination is enough to make me cry so I won't talk of that too much.  `Boy's Don't Cry' is a masterpiece of a film, one that will break your heart and crush your spirits but in the end amaze and move you beyond words.",1182729600,,3377,4.818024263431543
1073224,4,6305800073,"I don't really know how ""accurate"" the film is in portraying the main character. Apparently there was some sort of controversy over this. I think it doesn't matter that much: it's a feature film, not a biography. Of course it stylizes its characters. Complaining about this just distracts from the substance of the film.

So, I don't know what Teena Brandon was really like. But, in the director's interpretation, she is a deeply confused and helpless person, the scatterbrained type who doesn't quite understand the world around her. She doesn't really know what to do with her life, she has no plan and nothing to look forward to. However, she is very imaginative, and invents a detailed biography for herself. She also calls herself Brandon Teena and attempts to pass herself off as a man, but she also fabricates other parts of her life that don't deal with her gender. For instance, she tells the other characters that she has a child, with no prompting on their part. She doesn't tell lies ""on purpose,"" it's more like she needs to believe them herself. Her ""sexual identity crisis"" (her words, and she says them like she doesn't quite know what they mean) is part of a much larger, more general ""identity crisis.""

She commits theft, but she is essentially harmless to society. If she could find some kind of direction in life, she might find it easy to live normally, unlike the characters John and Tom, who really are genuine criminals, incapable of living any other way and unwilling to try. But more than anything, Brandon wants to be loved and accepted, instinctively. It doesn't really matter by whom. Consequently, she enters dangerous territory without understanding the risk to herself.

Long after the audience has realized that Brandon should leave town as soon as possible, she stays. Even after the first assault, it still seems like she doesn't understand her situation. Some critics complained about this aspect of Brandon's character, but I think it gives an air of genuine tragedy to the film. It's almost as if her fate is forcing her to stay.

The film reminded me a lot of Gus Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho,"" which is also about a lonely drifter who is stuck in a desolate region and craves love more than anything else. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is much better, because it lacks Van Sant's Shakespearean pretensions. But like Van Sant's film, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is best at appearances. The script is barely there. Half the film just wanders through dingy trailers, houses, bars and convenience stores, with convincingly forgettable dialogue. Most scenes are shot at night, usually indoors, so nature is totally absent. There's very little exposition. We don't really learn anything about the characters, but this is perfectly accurate. There is nothing to learn about them, and there's really nothing interesting that they could talk about.

But we can look at their faces, which are all chosen very well for the roles. Chloe Sevigny, as Lana, is immediately recognizable. Every suburb or small town has a girl like this, with a sullen face and a deliberately abrasive attitude intended to conceal her naivete. Every other face in the film is just as archetypical.

There is a moment of foreshadowing early in the film when John first encourages Brandon to drive over the speed limit, and then threatens her after they get pulled over by police. The impulsive, unreasoning way he goes from friendly to hostile is all the more frightening because it's so unexpected. When he finds out about Brandon's gender, he screams his disgust, but his anger is motivated more by ""traditional"" sexual jealousy. He would have assaulted a male rival also. But another man, especially one similar to John, might have been able to defend himself, whereas Brandon's gender and personality combine to make her uniquely vulnerable and defenseless, and this is the saddest thing about the story.

I do have a few problems with the film. It's very noticeable that all of the men in the film are vile and callous, not just John and Tom, but also the cops and the guys in the bar. At the same time, all of the women are basically sympathetic, not just Lana, but also her friend and even Lana's mother. Even if the women feel disgusted at Brandon's cross-dressing at first, they quickly come to support her. But the men never feel any remorse or sympathy, just rage and fear, and they blindly victimize everyone. I guess I can accept this in these particular characters, but still, I wonder about the director's intent.

The inevitable, brutal ending drags on for about half an hour, long after the conclusion becomes obvious. And the very last scene has a screaming toddler for maximum gut-wrenching effect. These lurid scenes may be manipulative (a similar scene in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is effective but occurs much more quickly), but there is also something believable in them. These men don't know anything that might inspire them to listen to reason or to feel compassion. It is hopeless to beg them for mercy.

I also don't quite believe the tender love scene between Lana and Brandon right after the first assault. The director includes it for pathos, to make the audience hope for their salvation, and to underscore how happy they might have been. But I'd suppose that right after such a terrifying experience, one would be too severely traumatized to express one's passion.

But, for most of its duration, the film is perceptive and believable, with a sympathetic and tragic heroine undone by circumstances that are too much for her to handle. The film is well in keeping with the tradition of American stories about marginal youth. If you like that subject, or if you are willing to consider watching a film about it, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a good choice.",1182211200,,5757,4.859327217125382
1073225,5,6305800073,"There's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said in the other reviews, but I do have a few extra comments.

Swank's performance really is incredibly brave and convincing. I was surprised not necessarily by how good her performance was, but how brave she was in really throwing herself whole-hog into the role and truly becoming a man. Her performance adds another vast dimension to the movie, particularly as I feel that in her performance alone does the character's motivation come through. You can sense just how exciting it is for her to flirt with becoming free of her gender, even if what she's doing is getting in a bar fight or doing stupid stunts on the back of a pickup. You can sense her euphoria at getting a taste of the experience of being a man. This creates the motivation for her character, as the man she wants to be IS the kind of guy who would get hurt and get into the kind of trouble she does. This is one case where the performance really IS one third of what the film as a whole is and I have no problem with Hilary Swank walking off with the best actress Oscar.

I am surprised that so many people at the time said the film was poorly directed. I think that Pierce has definitely watched her share of David Lynch films and uses what she's learned to cast an air of unreality and mythological significance to the events. I thought the sex scene was particularly good, because you see on Lana's face how Brandon is pleasing her in ways that her other boyfriends couldn't possibly. This is much more subtly done than in other lesbian films, where a character would probably have a line like ""well everyone knows that only a woman knows what a woman wants"" or something else-- this film is more powerful because it doesn't preach or be too heavy-handed. It is not without viewpoint, but it handles the matter subtly.

It's a little frustrating watching the movie just how stupid Brandon is, but hey, it's a true story and the film makes him out to be stupid and unstable from the start.

I'm gay, and as such I found this film's tagline upon release, ""A true story about finding the courage to be yourself,"" entirely disgusting. This is not about finding the courage to be yourself, it's about messed-up people who are at the mercy of forces within themselves that are beyond their control. It's about people who are so undersocialized that they have no way of knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel. I am so sick of the whole marketing slant of ""Being-gay-is-just-such-a-heartwarming-growing-experience"" that I truly want to vomit. I would like to think that someone out there could credit gay people with enough intelligence to accept that not everything about being gay or lesbian is a wonderful, warm, and affirming experience. I also think a tagline like that trivializes the emotions and experiences of the characters in a film like this. Luckily the film itself is free of such sentimentality.",1181692800,2,2947,4.6183206106870225

Brandon and Chloe fall in love, angering two men who begin to suspect Brandon's true identity.

Swank's performance as Brandon/Teena is simply remarkable.  She conveys the heartbreak and misery of an outsider, a misfit, and the need for love that is universal; she won the Oscar in 1999 for this role.  Sevigny is convincing as the girl who falls in love with both Brandon and Teena.

1073228,5,6305800073,"A very disquieting film that tells a story that seems so unreal that we need to discover, at the very end of it, the fate of the protagonists to believe it is a true story. It is first of all a story about the gender identity of a girl, Teena Brandon, who sees herself as a boy and wants to behave as one, to be one. She manages to go through it all and falls in love with a girl who falls in love with her too, thinking she is a boy. So far so good. But what will happen when her real identity comes out? And that is the drama. The brothers or local boys of the neighborhood of the girl who has fallen in love with Teena Brandon decide to take justice in their own hands. First they teach a lesson to that Teena and rape her ruthlessly. But this ends up in the sheriff's office and that is only the beginning of the end. Then the two boys decide to expedite real justice and they kill Teena along with another girl, and mother, that happens to be there at the wrong moment with her baby. The two culprits will be taken to court, tried, convicted and sentenced. But what can we do with such a tragedy? How can it be possible in our modern world that a gender crisis in the mind of a girl may cause such disorder among the people around her? How come the boys react so violently whereas the girls or even older women seem to be a lot more tolerant? What makes such a gender crisis so dramatic? There is no real answer and simple male bigotry is not enough to explain such events. Is malehood such a privilege, such an unsharable dignity that any woman who will desire to assume some of it for herself will turn the surrounding men into criminals? We are dealing here with sex or gender fetishism. But how come it is stronger among men than among women? Or would it be the same in reverse if a boy tried to assume a female identity? I am not sure. Men must feel particularly menaced by the gender wavering of a female who could thus penetrate the secret citadel of malehood without being a member of the brotherhood. Is it really an old story? Definitely not. It could happen again any time, and I would even say it does happen all the time here or there, openly but probably most of the time unknown of anyone because self-censored by the ""culprit"" of such wavering.

1073229,4,6305800073,"This is a story about a girl who has felt neglect, or she just wants to escape the bonds of the people she has known, it seems, to search for a girl who will accept her as a boy even though she's also a girl. At least, this is apparent in the movie, and neglect may not be true to Teena Brandon's real life. I'm sure there were people who loved her, but none of them were shown in this movie. She was set in a place where she was alone much of the time, living in a small home or trailer with her brother. It's sad to see neglect in so many people who are gay, though. I would say most really have heart. I have gone through neglect with my family or felt that they don't care enough or don't know how to care, and there is sometimes a sense of abandonment. We choose to leave; after some time we finally meet trouble and perhaps return to them. Then it's like they don't know us. No one knows us. And ""us"" I mean all of us. We're all in that situation, it seems. This movie displays what we are after neglect, searching for people who will fill the gap. To see this movie, you may agree that the characters are actually still children who have all felt neglect and are at the bottom of it all, working jobs they don't like. I really liked Hilary Swank in this. It was a very daring person to play. These people really knew what they were doing. I admire the efforts of the director as well, to see time pass in fast forward with music in Nebraska. The color and mood of the whole movie works to display Nebraska as desolate and sparse and superficial where the lead character is opposite of that with a lot of heart and curiosity leading her to trouble, which I also display in my writing. I'm from Nebraska and wrote a novel set there, which I intended to write to see it as a movie. I go by the author name Ian Bradley. Still not published, though. I give this movie an above average rating because it really works as a dream and is not overly raw. It makes me wonder why people like her end up with enemies. She deserved to live and be happy.

I also felt disgust, sadness and complete horror that these teenage boys were so insecure and uneducated about homosexuals (or anyone else who is different than them)that they actually commited murder!

This is the true story of a girl, Teena Brandon (Played by Hillary Swank)who was a lesbian and lived in a small midwestern town that didn't accept her homosexuality,
 so she met some friends in a town about a hundred miles away where no one knew her.

 She came to know a whole new circle of friends who upon introduction believed her to be a boy, and accepted her, so she reversed her first name and last name, and instead of being ""Teena Brandon"", she was now a He: ""Brandon Teena.""
And she continued living this masqurade,(not DARING to let them discover her true sex)
She even fell in love with a town girl she had a crush on (Chloe' Sevigny)

She became friends with the girls, and drinking buddies with the guys, and it was like a dream of acceptance come true for her, until they began to suspect her true sexual identity.

Her girlfriend DID stick by her and wanted to run off, It was a hick town anyway, PLUS she had no real family there to speak of,none that really cared,- and neither did Brandon (Teena), except for a brother who also didn't accept her...so the 2 were going to run off, but before they could- tragedy struck.

2 of the redneck boys RAPED her in the most horribly convincing rape I have ever seen on film, and when she went to the police, they took sides with the boys and wouldn't even arrest them, They tried to make the whole thing out like her sexuality PROVOKED the horrendous rape! It made me literally SICK and ANGRY!!

That night before they could leave town, The boys came back and murdered Teena Brandon, and the girl who put her up in her shed while hiding her out. There may have even been another murder, It has been so long since I have seen it, I am not sure.

Not only the girls rape made me sick, but the WHOLE unacceptance from EVERYONE, and how she always had to HIDE who and what she was...and HER acceptance of THIER UNacceptance just makes you CRY.

Although horribly upsetting, It is a must see...I know this movie set a lot of Gay rights into motion, and there are web sites you can go to and read about the REAL Teena Brandon, If you go to a search engine and type in her name.

Having said this, I have three words: watch this movie.

Hillary Swank is brilliant in her portrayal of Brandon Teena, a female to male transgendered person who was raped and murdered in Nebraska in 1993.  In fact, her performance was so good that I thought a man protrayed Brandon Teena, or at least an actual female to male transsexual who was also a good actor.  Her performance is accurate and powerful, and clearly she had done some research into the role.

For those not familiar with the story, I can tell you it is fairly accurately portrayed in every detail.  Brandon Teena was born Teena Brandon.  In 1993, Brandon Teena was living in with Lana Tisdel, when he was exposed as having been born female by John Lotter and Marvin Nissen, who stripped him in front of Lana.  They then took Brandon Teena outside, drove for a distance, and repeatedly beat and raped him.

When Brandon Teena reported the rape to law enforcement, they were insulting and hostile.  Eventually, the arrested Lotter and Nissen, but they were quickly released despite the violent nature of their crimes.  The two then hunted Brandon Teena down and murdered him, as well as Lisa Lambert and Philip DeVine, a couple Brandon was staying with at the time.  Refusing to accept Brandon as anything but an ""it,"" law enforcement thought DeVine, a disabled black man, was the true target.  Both Nissen and Lotter are members of white supremicist groups.

1073354,5,6305800073,"This was a sad movie based on the true story of Brandon Teena. A female living as a male. Brandon never felt like a female even though he was. Brandon always felt as though he were a male and so decided to move to a town where he could live as a male. I don't uderstand gays, lesbians, or those who are one sex but mentally feel as though they are the opposite sex but I don't have to understand them to treat them with respect and dignity. When Brandon was raped, the cop that interviewed him should have lost his badge right then. He treated Brandon so unfairly and was cruel. I feel he should also be held responsible for his murder. Had the cop done his job these people could have been spared. The cop was out of line in the way he questioned Brandon! Way out of line! It makes one wonder how many other law enforcement has done this same thing. This movie was so sad and heart-breaking....to know there are people out there in the world that will kill someone just because they are different or live their life in a way that many do not understand is sad. And to know we have cops out in the world that are suppose to uphold the law and protect but instead are so judgemental that they cost others their life. The men that killed Brandon, and the others took the lives of innocent people....took a mother from her baby and took these young people from their loved ones and yet they are still living....yeah sure they are in prison but for now they are alive. Brandon Teena was a victim of a hate crime...and the others that were killed were killed because they were there with Brandon. But these two men will have to face God on judgement day for what they did to these innocent young people. AS WILL THE COP THAT MAY HAVE PREVENTED THIS FROM HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH IF HE HAD DONE HIS JOB! As you will see in the movie. Another thing...the press should have kept there nose out of Brandon's arrest instead of printing that Brandon was female. That really hurt Brandon....just after the press printed this...Brandon was raped!  This movie shows the struggles Brandon faced and how mean people can be. An excellent movie but a very sad movie. I found this movie to tell much of the actual events as they happened. I had read the book on Brandon Teena...All She Wanted. The actress Hilary Swank did an outstanding job playing Brandon! I recommend this movie. Watch it and see how judgemental some people are and also how some law enforcement are also judemental...seeing only what they choose to see...and helping only those they choose to help. This movie will not only break your heart but will also make you angry!",1136160000,5,2621,4.426501035196687

1073356,5,6305800073,"""Boys Don't Cry"" was a sad and disgusting story, about a young girl name Teena Bredan, who is facing a sexual identity crisis. Although she doesn't want to admit it to herself, she is a lesbian, and she is a girl. The whole movie was a brilliant renactiment of the true story.

Teena Bredan is a girl, who wants to be a man. She is having trouble figuring out who she is and is having a sexual identity crsis. She goes to a bar one night and meets Candance, played by the girl who played Becky in Rossane for the first seasons (I don't know her name), who befriends her/him and brings him to her home. Brandon becomes friends with everyone instantly, he doesn't tell anyone that he is really a girl. After weeks of getting to know these people and living with them,he develops a relationship with Lana, played by Chloe Sevigny, who was also brillant in this film. Lana soon finds out that Brandon is not a full man when they start to become sexually active. She pauses for a moment, but realizes that she loves Brandon, no matter what. This is when things start to go wrong. John, Lana's ex boyfriend, and his friend, soon find out about Brandon. They are white trash who have never been outside of anything and don't follow the law. They end up brutally raping Brandon and then shooting Candance and Brandon in the end. The two people that Lana truly cared about in life.

This story was one of the most disgusting that I've heard . As I was watching, I thought to myself, how could someone be so cruel to another person, how could someone be so crazy? How could you ruin to love? Who in the wrold is really that close minded. This was a true tale of pain, love, suffering, confusion, wanting to live a good life, and trying to find yourself.",1121299200,4,1743,4.3765432098765435
1073357,4,6305800073,"This movie is great in many aspects. The actors, music, emotions - it's all there. Yes, it makes you think about sexual discrimination, about love and hate and the challanges kids in rural places are facing. The movie is clearly well done, it stresses you hard, the scenes stay in your head. It's all true.

But there is one problem. This movie is so straightforward. After watching the first five minutes you pretty much can guess what will happen at the end. And this is exactly what happens. The movie is based on a true story and it does look like a documentary. There are not tricks, no surprises. There are a few good guys, a lot of bad guys. Bad guys are stronger. They win. There is one tragic love and a little bit of hope in the end. Everything is predetermined and there is no escape. Maybe some slim chance.

If you've never been in poor rural places, that would be an eyeopener for you, but most people are familiar with that feeling already. Just pretend you're a weird kid in a local ghetto.

Cross gendering performances can often be very unbelievable (e.g., Barbra Streisand's YENTL), and although there are moments when Hilary can't hide being Hilary, she is amazingly convincing as a somewhat effeminate young man who wins the heart of doe eyed Lana (a brilliant Chloe Sevigny).  Whether one can condone Brandon's deceptive life, one can't help but be disgusted in the tragic end she so undeservedly comes to.  Peter Skarsgaard, a highly underappreciated actor, is chilling in his role of John, Lana's sometime boyfriend who goes bananas when he finds out who Brandon really is..or isn't.  Jeanette Arnette as Lana's mother is also quite good in a difficult role.

1073410,4,6305800073,"I saw this movie about a week after seeing ""Million Dollar Baby.""  The question that immediately comes to mind is, how many contemporary actresses have the talent of Hilary Swank?  She is absolutely amazing as Brandon, the main character of the movie.  Her performance is nothing less than astounding and she deserved every bit of her academy award.  .

The movie is about a young woman named Teena Brandon who wants to be a man and, therefore, lives her life under the alias of Brandon Teena.  She goes to live in an area of viral white trash that is unlike any region I've ever seen and undoubtedly unlike any region which actually exists.

The rural community she moves into is Hollywood's version of the heartland and it doesn't seem to have much relation to the real thing.  It is a dark fantasy of American life wherein religion has been transfused from the local culture. The population of the countryside seems to have been replaced with the inhabitants of a large mental hospital.  Yet, anti-social personalities can be found everywhere and this area of Nebraska is no exception.  Swank's character is highly unfortunate to have befriended two of them.  John and Tom are felons with no respect for the law or any other human beings, and the heroine, through no real fault of her own, unwittingly becomes the target of their ire.

Peter Sarsgaard plays a convincing monster who is the source of most of the film's drama while the love affair between Swank and Chloe Sevigny was quite authentic.  The tale is tragic but extremely well-done.  It would be hard not to recommend this one.",1119052800,3,1592,4.741818181818182

Although it's well made and educational, I don't consider this movie an entertainment movie. The story is based on a true story, and the topic is extremely heavy and serious. With that being seid, I think the film conveyed the message very well.

No matter how sad the story is, the movie itself is well made with good acting, especially the main character who gest killed due to homophobia has done an excellent acting.

To be honest I don't want to watch it again because of the cruelty, violence, and so much suffering, even though I know that they are part of our reality. However, I surely think it is a well done movie.",1113955200,,712,4.469230769230769
1073412,5,6305800073,"Following a potent hero's journey template, Boys Don't Cry packs a vast and profound message about American society.  It feels especially pertinent in an age of red-state vs. blue state cultural diviseness.  First-time director, Kimberly Peirce, a real artist, avoids such alienating and inaccurate generalities, and grounds her progressive values of equality and opportunity in the psyches and motivations of her characters.  Beginning in a roller-rink fantasia, the film immediately draws one into Brandon Teena's (the deservedly accoladed Hilary Swank) enthusiastic and unattainable dream.  As the plot develops, Peirce expertly balances the ominous and the exciting, pitting Brandon's relationship with Lana (a dynamite Chloe Sevigny) against Lana's violent ex-boyfriend, John (an eerie and charismatic Peter Sarsgaard).  The engrossing drama exists within the socio-political mileu of rural disadvantage, ignorance, and substance abuse (how many scenes convey characters drinking alcohol?) enabling the viewer to reap a multi-faceted and rewarded viewing experience.  Highly recommended.",1113609600,2,1092,6.198675496688741
1073413,5,6305800073,"After applauding Hilary Swank's Best Actress Academy Award for her role in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, I thought I'd better rent BOYS DON'T CRY, for which Swank also received an Oscar. Where have I been that I haven't seen it until now?

Here, Swank plays Teena Brandon, a 21-year old woman with female genitalia but the sexual inclinations of a male. Ultimately, she'd like a sex change. In the meantime, she cuts her hair short, wraps up her breasts, pads the crotch of her jeans, renames herself Brandon Teena, and sets out to pick-up chicks. Now, in my corner of the world - Southern California - one could pull this off with panache. Trouble is, Brandon lives in Nebraska, and she eventually runs afoul of a couple of good ol' boys, John (Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brandon Sexton), the former being the erstwhile boyfriend of Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the girl with whom Brandon develops a love relationship. The violence John and Tom eventually visit upon Brandon/Teena gives your average bigot a bad name, and reminds me why Nebraska is Flyover Country, especially when it's not pigskin season and the locals don't have Cornhusker football to keep them occupied. (Ok, ok. I admit I'm being unfair to Nebraska. After all, I'm not from Oklahoma and a Sooner fan.)

Swank's role in BOYS DON'T CRY is, in many ways, grittier and incorporates more extremes of emotion than that in MILLION DOLLAR BABY. At times, I winced and slowly sunk down in my seat, much as I did as I watched Charlize Theron's bravura performance in MONSTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY never elicited that reaction. Here, Hilary elevates what might otherwise be a 3 or 4-star soap opera about the lives of trailer trash to 5-star heights.

The sad part is that BOYS DON'T CRY is based on a true story. At the time the film was released, the real-life John and Tom were serving prison sentences. As for Teena, well, it's a shame she didn't live in a more tolerant, cosmopolitan environment. For some, the great empty space of America's Heartland is not the place to be.",1111795200,2,2028,4.72316384180791
1073414,5,6305800073,"Hillary Swank is wonderful in this film. It shows how homophobic and hateful some people can be. There are so many different kinds of people in this world, and we see a lot of them in this one film. That's what makes ""Boys Don't Cry"" so unique.",1110931200,,244,4.212765957446808
1073415,4,6305800073,"I am giving Kimberly Peirce's BOYS DON'T CRY four stars because, simply looking at it as a piece of filmmaking, it is startlingly effective. But I must also admit that, after seeing this movie, I was a little uneasy about the filmmakers' approach to this based-on-real-life story, one that I think to some extent simplifies and conventionalizes what could have been truly disturbing material.

There is no doubt that BOYS DON'T CRY is acted and directed with great sensitivity and realism. This one of the most vivid depictions of humdrum small-town life I have seen; you really feel as if you are in Falls City, Nebraska, among its wide open spaces and bored citizens. And the performances are excellent. Hilary Swank, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, and it is a sympathetic, totally involving performance, one that beautifully conveys the joy she takes in being a male, and her desperation as her ruse threatens to fall apart. The other performances are no less worthy, though, particularly Chloe Sevigny's as small-town dreamer Lana Tisdel, and Peter Sarsgaard's as John Lotter, who will eventually turn on Brandon. And, as a whole, it must be said that BOYS DON'T CRY is effectively tragic and haunting, without ever lapsing into heavy-handed sentimentality.

And yet, there is something about the movie that strikes me as false. I think that, to some degree, Peirce has simplified this fascinating, unsettling story, and turned it into a modern day operatic tragedy (in its own down-to-earth way). She has turned the real-life story into a rather more conventional tale about intolerance---Teena Brandon is tortured and then murdered for daring to be something she is not---and thereby spurned any serious attempts at genuine insight into why Teena Brandon did what she did. What made her feel more comfortable acting like a man, for instance? We never really know; the movie never truly bothers to explain, except by dropping vague hints about a ""sexual identity crisis."" Instead, Peirce is simply content to tell a story that, at heart, is about how a Love That Never Dies---the relationship between Brandon and Lana (whose loyalty to Brandon I personally found slightly unconvincing, as true as it may be)---can triumph over the rage of a bunch of small-town bigots. What the film lacks, I think, is the willingness to go deeper into its material. On its own terms, the movie is effectively tragic and haunting; but, if Peirce was more willing to dig deeper into its characters, and not settle for simplification and conventionality, BOYS DON'T CRY could have been truly disturbing and thought-provoking rather than merely sad.

Still, I don't want to sell this movie too short. This is basically a good movie, one that is realistic, well-made, and superbly acted. For real insight into Teena Brandon, you will have to look elsewhere; but what BOYS DON'T CRY lacks in nuance, it makes up for in heartbreaking big gestures. Recommended, with reservations.",1105747200,6,3004,5.064646464646465
1073416,5,6305800073,"This movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don't want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.

I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.

The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure that something bad is going to happen.

Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Elodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.

Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.

Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an ""X"" rating as any ""R"" movie you'll ever see. It will
make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.",1097452800,90,3463,4.38785046728972
1073417,4,6305800073,"I thought the movie was well-directed and well-acted. They briefly tried to show what loose cannons Tom and John were, although the actor portraying John Lotter played him far more intelligently than he was or is in reality.  Chloe Sevigny as Lana was beautiful, sloe-eyed, and mysterious, not to mention extremely understanding of Brandon's predicament, however her boo-hooing scene at the end was quite fake. Hilary Swank was completely convincing as Brandon, the girl who wanted to be a boy - so congenial and flattering that all the little girls wanted him.

Unfortunately, the murder scene was very contrived and didn't ring true.  Actually, the only thing for sure that happened was that Lana's mom told John and Tom where to find Brandon, even though she knew that Brandon was in fear for his life for reporting that they had raped him.  Brandon wasn't murdered because he lied and deceived - he was murdered because a couple of morons thought that if Brandon was out of the way, he wouldn't be able to testify against them in a rape trial. They were unable to formulate the thought that instead of being tried for rape, they would most certainly be convicted of murder.",1095292800,4,1177,4.811881188118812

I had heard the story, but hearing about it, and actually watching it is totally different because you get to see the events that occurred for yourself. I couldn't imagine something that inhumane happening to a human being at the hands of another, and that's what made me cry like a baby. No human being deserves to be raped, beaten, humiliated, and degraded just because they aren't what you thought they were. True enough, Brandon wasn't honest from the beginning, but that just doesn't justify what happened to him in no shape, form, or fashion. I had only one question at the end of this movie...What makes people so hateful? Also, what I found upsetting was that the actual assailants didn't even have anything to do with the situation at hand. If anybody had a right to be angry it was Lana, and if she accepted Brandon for who he really was then none of this should've even happened. I definitely see Hilary Swank in a new light now.

*Assaulted* by feelings of injustice, feelings of rage toward ignorance and cruelty suffered by the story's heroes.
*Convicted* by the fact that my lack of education on issues from which I personally don't suffer (in this case, gender identity crises) could make me appear indifferent to intolerance.
*Humbled* by the realization that, though I seek to broaden my views, there is always more compassion to be instilled and lessons to be found in examples I never considered could relate to me.
A person doesn't have to relate with gender identity issues to be affected by the weight of a film that so successfully  entreats its viewers to recognize the injustice of prejudice. Though it may seem fairly simple - a true story in which a girl is victimized once by her own psyche and again by the fear of her lover's kin - ""Boys Don't Cry"" is an understated masterpiece.

1073470,5,6305800073,"This is a very important movie and I recommend it to anyone (over 18 only because of the violence and sexuality).
The true story of Teena Brandon, ""Boys Don't Cry"" will make you sick, sad, and intrigued at the same time.  Having grown up in a small rural town full of tunnel-visioned people, I can relate with the movie from the stand point of being different and sticking out like a sore thumb.
Yes, this film has been ""Hollywood-ized"", but the true story it is based upon has been told without apology or disclaimer. Because it is an independent film, it doesn't have the big-budget look, and it really doesn't need it.  The story gets told honestly, and with a story like this, it wouldn't have been right any other way.
Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for this, and you will believe her portrayal of a woman trying her darndest to be a guy.  Many times, I forgot that she was a woman, but not in a campy, impersonator-type way.  She looks like a young, baby-faced boy/man, and has the mannerisms, look, and lingo down.
This is a tragic tale and Teena Brandon was definitely a messed-up individual, however, her gender-identity really takes a back seat to her up-bringing, her choice of friends, her habitual lying, and troubles with the law.  Because of the combination, she is ignored by her family and the legal-system; the two entities anyone should be been able to count on.  In the end, these are the things that kill her - the two morons who pull the trigger are just the vehicle.  Still, you will end up hating the killers and see their backwards, red-necked male-macho baloney for what it is way before the movie heats up.
This is more than just a transgender movie, it is a complex tale that includes a cast of characters you have probably known once or twice in your life.  And that, hopefully, will make you think about and compel you to see this movie more than once.  It's message deserves that you do.",1074643200,,1920,4.542028985507247

There's hell to pay when it's discovered that Brandon is really a girl, dealing with sexuality issues that have plagued his entire life.
Based on the 1993 real-life story of Teena Brandon, this movie went over the top in terms of popularity, primarily because of Swank's unsentimental performance that brought Brandon's conflicts and passions heartbreaking to life. It's hard to imagine using the word ""sweet"" to describe a movie as agonizing and sad as this one it, but there you have it - and most people will feel nothing but respect for Brandon as the closing credits roll.",1073520000,,793,4.795620437956204

Hilary's acting was stellar in this - yet in real life she's not at all like that butch lesbian girl she plays in this movie, and so I found it hard to re-adjust my impression of her after seeing her in other movies and in magazines with long hair and being feminine and all... The acting was so good that I honestly detested every single guy that appeared in this movie for being the horrible ba****ds that they were, even though (I know, I know) they are just actors and the real ones are out there and I don't even know how they look. But still... ironically if I'd met my husband back then I'd probably not even give him a second look.
This is one of those movies you either want to watch or can't be bothered to. If you're a guy who really can't be interested in spending some of your time watching a film about 1)a really butch Hilary Swank and 2)a tearjerking movie, then save yourself the trouble. This is a chick-flick in many respects - its theme is about lesbianism, and the fact that this was based on a real life story of Brandon Teena in a stuffy-minded town in Nebraska made it all the more depressing. I walked away hoping in my heart that she's happy now wherever she is. But then this didn't have to happen to her. So all the more it affirms the fact that life's not fair.
This movie is also studded with surrealistic blurry images which actually made the budding love story between Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny even more compelling...

The fears, confusion, and love affairs are accurate.  Parts of this movie may be disturbing, but it's necessary to inform the audience of what happened.  Hilary Swank performs delightfully in the role of Brandon Teena, deserving her the Oscar for Best Actress.  The writers also dig deep into body shape securities.  Chloe Sevigny expresses this greatly in her Oscar nominated role as Lana, Teena's girlfriend.  Lana proves that there are people who accept transgender lifestyle.
Many movies about homosexuality are released, but not many about transgenders are released.  Therefore, the producers, director, and writers were under further pressure trying to give it extra quality.  They did everything right.  Those who are offended by such issues must get over it and watch this movie.  This is guaranteed to touch everyone's heart.  Why didn't ""Boys Don't Cry"" receive more Oscar nominations?

1073562,5,6305800073,"Hilary Swank won an award for her powerful portrayal of Teena Brandon, the sexual identity-confused woman on the run from the law. This film is very powerful, as it invokes various amounts of intense emotion and thought within the viewer, and the fact that this is based on a true story is what makes the film the more powerful.
A quick synopsis on the film:
Teena Brandon (who dresses like a boy, and goes by the alias of Brandon Teena) gets into a barfight over a girl named Candace (played by Alicia Goranson, as seen on television sitcom Roseanne), and in the midst of this, meets her friends John (played by Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (played by Brendan Sexton III), two ex-cons. Teena becomes buddies with these two, and they invite her to a party in their hometown. The next day, they go to a different bar, and she then meets the moody and enigmatic Lana (played by Chlo Sevigny), along with her mother (played by Jeanetta Arnette) and one of Lana's friends, Kate (played by Allison Folland.)
Things seem quite bright and rosy, as Teena seems to be accepted as if she were one of the family. She seems to become one of the boys along with Tom and John, drinking and getting into trouble like any typical young misfit would. She develops an ever-blossoming love relationship with Lana, which helps to showcase some of the most beautiful, heartwarming and poignant attributes of the film. Everything seems quite lovely.
Later, things start to take a turn for the worse, as Teena's skeletons start to catch up with her, and the guise she depended on slowly starts to crumble. The beautiful lie gets shattered, and everything that was once peaceful becomes corrupted, and ultimately, she payed the price in one of the worst ways possible. As things start to crumble for Teena, the viewer's emotions start to spiral downhill from what was once an ethereal, transcendent disposition in quite an intense, earth-shattering way as well. You start to feel bad for Teena, and start to sympathize with her, even though she's made quite a few mistakes (e.g. breaking the law, lying about her real gender.) That's one of the many things that made this film so profound.
Hilary Swank gave a powerful and convincing performance, and I think she deserved the award she won indefinitely. Chlo Sevigny also gave an excellent performance as the moody, enigmatic and sympathetic Lana, who seemed to have quite a bit underneath her surface. She should have won an award as well. I can't stress these actresses enough (along with the director and film in general.)
An excellent, powerful film, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. This review won't do it any justice. It's beautiful, sad, ethereal, poignant, atmospheric and disturbing all at once. I highly recommend it to people who think they can handle this story. Also, check out the documentary called ""The Brandon Teena Story"" if you've watched this movie, and wanted more information regarding the story, since this movie was based on that documentary. However, the documentary is more disturbing than the film.",1056326400,,3059,4.850860420650096
1073563,5,6305800073,"They said on TV that this film was based on a true story and that immediately made me think that someone in this film will have to die. So I was prepared for that, but I was really quite surprised in terms of how the story developed. Usually when this type of film is made the main character would have left earth suddenly and too early. You feel really upset after seeing it and all the injustice made against this particular person and that hasn't been made right under their time here with us, living, breathing.
This film however left me feeling comforted for his/her person and what he/she was given from his/her girlfriend. At the same time it rightfully disturbed my mind, in that way that you think such a thing should never have happened and how long will it take us humans before we learn to not interfere with other peoples right to themselves and being they way that suits them? Of course on terms where it doesn't hurt anybody else. Sure, you could argue that the perpetrator in this case was actually hurt, but no you don't get to go around hurting others because of your own hearts sorrow due to another not wanting the same as you...
As for the acting on Hilary's part - it's a piece of art! You would have to work real hard to make such a convincing portrait, she's brilliant.

1073565,5,6305800073,"""Boys Don't Cry"" has been cited for two major Academy Award nominations:  Chloe Sevigny for Best Supporting Actress and Hilary Swank for Best Actress.  The film is based on a multiple murder that occurred in a run down Nebraska farmhouse in 1993.  What appeared at the time to be an inexplicably brutal killing soon turned into something far more intriguing as the true story of the killers and one of the victims emerged.  Among the dead was a person who had been in town only a short while but had already become one of the town's most fascinating characters:  a rebel, a loyal friend, and an irresistible romancer of the ladies.

That person was Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), not the boy he and everyone else wanted him to be.  Knowing him as a dashing boyfriend to many women, people were shocked to learn after his death that Brandon Teena was, in fact, a woman from Lincoln, Nebraska, named Teena Brandon.  While Teena was a young adult trapped in a world that did not accept her, Brandon Teena was a fun-loving fellow with beautiful girlfriends who publicly adored him.

""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of those bizarre true stories that cannot help but fascinate and intrigue.  For the film to succeed, the role of Teena as Brandon must be convincing.  If everyone who knew Brandon believed that she was a he, the audience has to be convinced as well, despite the explicit information given at the very beginning of the film.  Swank accomplishes this through her angular face, close-cropped hair, physical mannerisms, and lilting midwestern drawl. Though the viewer watches carefully to catch a moment in which her femininity comes through, it never does.

It is virtually impossible not to be drawn to the film because of Swank's performance, which is captivating. The film is violent, often painfully so, as co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce recounts the odd events surrounding Brandon's ability to endear himself to people -- particularly female -- and to make friends easily.  In the few scenes in which Brandon's true sex is revealed, Swank transforms into an awkward, embarrassed, tense outcast, knowing full well she is perceived as a freak.  Gone is Brandon's winning smile, gone is Brandon's confidence, and gone is the very persona Teena has adopted.

""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of those films that simply must be seen.  It is unique among standard Hollywood fare.  Not for the squeamish, it is a look at a dark, unpleasant side of how differences in individuals are not tolerated, society often accepts the expedient lie rather than the difficult truth, and stupidity and bigotry can lead to tragedy.

Swank elicits viewer compassion on several levels.  Clearly, she is emotionally troubled, yet has adjusted her persona to fit in and feel comfortable.  Her Brandon can flirt with attractive girls, become friends with them, and even carry the relationship to a sexual level.  In the latter part of the film, she is the object of violence simply because she has successfully fooled those around her -- primarily low-life types whose own sexuality is threatened and whose alcohol-clouded minds inspire them to a ""payback"" of humiliating brutality.

The script, by Peirce and Andy Bienen, moves along briskly, seldom meandering.  There is no sense of padding, as each scene provides a new dimension to the story.  We learn that Brandon has a police record for petty crimes, but little else about Teena's/Brandon""s past is revealed. This gives the film a suitable mystery.  The viewer shares an off-balance feeling with the characters in the film.  The writers based their screenplay on an assortment of trial transcripts, media coverage, interviews with local kids, real-life participants, and their own imagination. The result is an intense look at events in the life of a misfit being the ""perfect boyfriend"" to lonely, innocent, and underprivileged young women.

Rated R, ""Boys Don't Cry"" succeeds primarily because of Swank's unique, often startling performance. It transcends the ordinary and sweeps the viewer up into Brandon Teena's peculiar,
tragic life.",1052265600,2,4069,5.050898203592815
1073566,4,6305800073,"'Boys Don't Cry'is a honest and at times sad story about the story of Brandon Teena. This film is charming, compelling yet the outcome is sad. What drew me to liking this film is the love story between Brandon and Lana. Hilery Swank did a fantastic, believeable job of portraying the ... identity crisis of Teena Brandon. Chloe' Sevigny was mesmerizing as Lana. There was fantastic chemistry between the two, and I completely understood what the director was saying. This is a important film that should be seen with a important massage. By Justine Ryan",1049500800,,553,4.831578947368421
1073567,5,6305800073,"When I originally saw this movie I gave it 4 stars.  Now on rewatching I'm giving it 5.  It lost a star because though an excellent movie I did think it dragged in some sections and parts became quite tedious.  However, it is on rewatching that you can really appreciate the mastery of the movie.  The true life story of Teena Brandon, who masqueraded as a man and found a place among a family in Nebraska as well as a girlfriend, Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who upon discovering he's really a she realises she loves Teena/Brandon anyway.
What makes it better second time round is the ominous sense of foreboding over the whole scenario once you have the ending in mind the whole time.  It's difficult to know where to begin with explaining why the movie is so good.  The obvious point is Hilary Swank, who gives in one of the truly great female performances of all time as Teena/Brandon.  She reportedly prepared for the role by living as a man for 4 months and all of her mannerisms, the way she holds herself and how she talks are all evident of this.  You will actually believe that a very attractive woman (just see her doe-eyed performance in Insomnia) is a young man.  Every single part of her performance here is multi-faceted, speaking anguish, pain and fear of discovery in every gesture.  Her best scenes though are those where she is interviewed by unsympathetic police officers after her rape, stumbling over the words as she is forced to reveal not only to the police officers but herself what she really is.  This is an absolutely heartbreaking moment that, for me, had more power than the horrific rape scene.  A lot of people will have a problem with this scene and it's understandable because it is horrific to watch, and you will find yourself repeating to yourself that you can't believe this really happened.  Incidentally, the questions asked at the police station at the end are reportedly the real thing, a tape of the questions asked to the real Teena Brandon.
Of course, to praise Hilary Swank isn't to forget Chloe Sevigny, who is perfect in her role as a bored small-town girl who's looking for something, anything to break the boredom.  Her wide-eyed performance works wonders and she complements an all-round impressive cast.  Yet the movie also works as an emotional catharsis and besides perhaps depressing you horribly does ask some pretty important questions about identity and prejudice.  There are a few scenes that will probably stick in your head, such as the mother's firm avowal that she hates Teena/Brandon simply because he lied to her, something that goes hand-in-hand with freely admitting people she knows as rapists into her home.  In the end this is basically a story of not love gone wrong but love forced off its path by petty prejudices and narrow-minded ideals of what love should be about.  And whilst this ideas are never shoved down your throat by Pierce, you will definitely be left wondering this.  Boys Don't Cry is a magnificent piece of filmmaking that may stand as one of the truly great indie films of all time.",1047600000,,3066,4.718574108818011
1073568,4,6305800073,"I found this story so incredibly sad. I haven't seen the documentary but would like to and probably will,I've read the reviews about it. Its a very disturbing movie especially the total failure of law enforcement to help this young woman. I also couldn't believe that the mother would tell where Teena(Brandon) was staying, she must have know of the intent of the two boys. Its just unbelievable that she would do that.
After reading the true story I was a bit dissapointed in the liberties taken by the film makers. Especialy that Brandon thought that Lana had betrayed her to the two rapists because Lana said that ""she would be ok in their company"". That was must have been heart breaking to Brandon, actually shattering when you think about it. The movie gave no inkling of this.
But it is still a riveting movie and an absolute tragedy...
Enough said cold blooded murders like this are horrible and the movie did a good job shedding light into this dark little corner of America.",1044230400,,984,4.660919540229885

It's about a young girl who is gay in the south and she meets a girl and they fall in love, even after she funds out that Brandon is a girl.

But here's the hard part...
The final 15 minutes of this movie are EXTREMELY difficult to watch (because of a rape scene). I first thought that this was a great drama (unfortunately for me being ignorant to the story)  and I figured that it was just going to be a good movie and really nothing else. For me, I personally couldn't get the last 15 minutes of this movie out of my mind for weeks. Trust me, I was that disturbed about it.
But I don't want anyone to pass up this movie because it is a great movie and Hillary Swank showed why she won her Best Actress with this one.

How fragile life is, and yet some people just snuff it out as easy as snuffing out a candle flame.
Hilary Swank portrays Brandon very well - and it was a well deserved award she won. Brandon at least had the desire and courage to search for his niche in life, and to follow his dreams. How many people actually achieve that in this day and age?
The roughnecks didn't understand him (which is understandable cos of the way their lifes were structured and their nurturing from young).
This is exactly the kind of discrimination that goes on even in freedom proclaiming USA, what more other homophobic countries?
Everyone artiste in this film had a vital part to play to keep the film moving, which is exactly what they did.

Cheers to the director for not trying to explain the complexities of why Brandon is the way she is. Also cheers for not making the movie sappy, or sympathetic.

IN A SOCIETY THAT IS FULL OF RACISM AND VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF HATRED, THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THE HATE FIRST HAND.
THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE WITNESSES THIS FIRST HAND AND AT THE SAME TIME TRIES TO COME TO GRIPS WITH HER OWN LIFE!!!
THIS FILM, IN MY OPINION, IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE OF IT'S REALISM.
I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CANNOT CHOOSE WHO THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH!!
THIS FILM, WITH MANY SEQUENCES THAT ARE VERY HARD TO WATCH, SHOW IN DETAIL THE HATE THAT SOCIETY SHOWS TO SOME PEOPLE.
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ONLY VIEW THIS FILM IF YOU ARE OPEN-MINDED.
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD SIMPLY TOSS THIS MOVIE OUT OF THEIR ""TO SEE"" LIST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE STORY.
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE, AFTER VIEWING THE FILM, THAT MIGHT EVEN
SAY THAT THE MOVIE IS TRASH.
HOWEVER, ANYONE THAT WOULD SAY THAT, IS TOO CLOSE-MINDED AND THEY NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ""THE REAL WORLD.""
EVERYONE HAS A CHOICE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE TO LIVE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE INDIVIDUALS' CHOICE TO MAKE...AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT CHOOSE THE SAME SEXUAL PREFERENCES FOR OURSELVES, WE MUST LEARN TO RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S CHOICES!!!
THIS MOVIE HAS A DEPRESSING FEELING THROUGHOUT AND IT FEELS AS IF THE MOVIE MAKES THE AUDIENCE FEEL EVERY EMOTION THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE FEELING.
THE MOVIE WAS INTERESTING FROM BEGINNING TO END. I JUST HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE THE MESSAGE THAT IT BRINGS.
IT IS A MESSAGE TARGETED TO THE MANY PEOPLE THAT SHOW HATE TO OTHERS BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER SEXUAL CHOICES OR DECISIONS.
IN OTHER WORDS, AS INDIVIDUALS, WE NEED TO RESPECT EACH OTHERS CHOICES OF LIFESTYLE, SEXUAL PREFERENCES, ETC.
I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS THIS:
WE ARE WHO WE ARE, AND WHO WE MUST BE, IS WHO WE ARE!!
WE MUST BE OURSELVES!!!
WITH A STORY AS COMPELLING AND TOUCHING AS THIS, IT IS SURE TO STIR UP SOME EMOTIONS WITHIN YOU. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL.
SO DON'T LOOK AT THIS MOVIE AND LAUGH, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, SEE IT WITH AN OPEN MIND!! IT DESERVES JUST THAT- AN OPEN MIND!!!
THE DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE BY HILLARY SWANK IS CAPTIVATING AND CHLOE SEVIGNY SHOWS US HER ACTING TALENTS AS WELL!!
THE ACTING IS TOP-NOTCH BY THESE TWO ACTRESSES, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR AND WON NUMEROUS AWARDS!!
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ROLES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND APPRECIATED.
THE DRAMA IS IN PLACE AND IT TARGETS YOUR EMOTIONS.
SO IF GOOD DRAMA IS YOUR THING, THEN SEE THIS FILM...AND AFTER IT TOUCHES YOUR LIFE, MAYBE THE EXISTING HATE WILL GO AWAY!!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE IN IT'S OWN RIGHT AND IT HAS LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON MY LIFE. IT MAY DO THE SAME TO YOU!!
FEEL THE PAIN - SEE THE HURT - PUT YOURSELF IN HER SHOES-

1073655,5,6305800073,"i've pretty much stopped writing reviews, but this movie drew me back into the ring.  i usually have a strong point of view with things i read or watch, and can critique them comfortably, but not with this one.  all i know is that i felt disturbed, and slept horribly, after watching it.  i think it kicked up some real deep stuff in me.  but i still give it five stars, because its quality shined through.
incidentally, i almost stopped watching it entirely a couple of times during the film.  this was a film that like FEW others i could call TRULY DEPRESSING.  the crux of what made it feel depressing for me was that it was about a human being who was so STUCK in their life.  there felt like so few options for brandon, like his/her only choice was to live a lie.  it's like he/she so wanted to be something he/she wasn't that she/he just had to pile on lie after lie.  that's what killed me.  it was a story about a person who just SIMPLY DID NOT FIT IN OUR SOCIETY.  that's i guess what this film was about.  it was a major criticism about our society - a society that just accepts people who fit into narrow little windows of sex, sexual orientation - and certainly gender.  god, if i can't even comfortably choose a pronoun (he/she) for brandon, how would it feel to BE brandon...or teena?
i really do think brandon was neither a man nor a woman, a boy nor a girl.  he/she was a person somewhere in the middle, and because of our society's small-minded ways brandon just did the best he/she could...and picked a team and started playing.  she felt more like a man and tried going that way.  i myself am a therapist, and wondered how i would have dealt with a patient like brandon.  suggested a sex-change?  suggested more self-acceptance?  suggested anything?  cried?
one other thing that got me, and that i found painful, was that brandon's problems were not just about gender - and his/her gay friend summed it up nicely about the consequences of his/her destructive criminal/lying/irresponsible tendencies, from what i remember.  ""brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.""  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.
so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.

1073656,3,6305800073,"This was a film that worked on my emotions like no other film has before. It's a devastating story about a woman with a sexual identity crisis, named Teena Brandon who dressed up like a guy, took hormone shots, and called herself Brandon Teena.

1073658,1,6305800073,"This movie has a big lie at its center...here it is in summary:  Teena Brandon was murdered because she used and deceived people - those people themselves being fellow criminals who were in and out of prison thus being a dangerous bunch in the first place - and she got caught and killed by them.  It had little to do with the fact that she was a woman pretending to be a man.  This movie tries to get you to believe the lie that she was murdered for her gender confusion, and thus it was a hate crime like the one Matthew Shepard was victim of, and not the truth that she was pretty much a criminal herself who got offed by fellow prison parolees, which though tragic is simply not the same kind of crime.
As a movie it's merely OK with a few dry patches, though the director shows a lot of talent.  I think she (the director) was limited by a mediocre script and a deeply flawed premise (see above).  I look forward to her future work.
My only other quibble with this movie is they clearly have a toddler in a scene where graphic violence is filmed.  If we protect our animals from harm while using them to make a movie (as we should), how is it that we allow a movie crew to terrorize a tiny baby just to get a shot?",1017100800,25,1219,4.122362869198312
1073659,4,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry is the movie that earned a Best Actress Oscar for Hilary Swank. Hers was a role few actresses could have played well, and she certainly deserves the praise she got, She has an interesting film career ahead of her. Call her a force to be reckoned Personally, I would have voted for Annette Bening in American Beauty. When I was a kid I, too, was mesmerized by actors playing odd, weird and/or flashy characters. Lately, I have come to the conclusion that playing a so-called normal character well and making that role unforgettable is much harder than it seems. This is a purely personal opinion and is not meant to lessen Ms. Swank's formidable talents in any way.
The movie is the story of Teena Brandon [Swank], and, while some of the facts have been altered, it is a true story. Brandon was a troubled young girl from the Midwest who, in the early 1990s, decided that she should live her life as a boy. She wanted to literally change her sex. There is a tiny percentage of males who wish to become female in America, and, apparently, the number of women wanting to become men is even smaller. Teena Brandon became Brandon Teena. Outside of New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco, Brandon would have been considered an oddity, if not a threat. He, as I have come to think of Brandon, attempted to do it in an impoverished, backwoods setting, and the results were tragic.
As a movie, Boys Don't Cry is the most impassioned plea for tolerance seen in a long time. It is difficult to watch it and not feel compassion for Brandon, if only because he was one of life's doomed souls. Ms. Swank portrays him as almost a ruffian, yet one who is essentially an innocent. Because the change [and the deception] works for Brandon, he honestly believes it should work for the people he meets. That is to say, since he accepts himself as a man, why can't others be fooled indefinately. He knows that people must not find out he is really a woman, but he does not think through how they might react if they do.
Brandon winds up in a small town where he falls in love with Lana [Chloe Sevigney, nominated for Best Supporting Actress]. She's a nice enough girl. It's her family and her mother's friends who are dangerous. Lana can do little about her family, and Brandon turns a blind eye to potential problems. He does everything he can to ingratiate himself with them and is successful at first.
I am trying not to give away too much of the plot here, but it is impossible to write even a bare-bones summary without evoking a sense of foreboding about the whole situation. It would also be unfair not to remark that Boys Don't Cry is brilliant but dark. It is both the most poignant and the most depressing movie of 1999. I highly recommend it, but warn you to prepare yourself for a heart-wrenching and soul-searching experience.",1016496000,17,2833,4.524366471734893

This is a movie that I've seen twice, and I thought once was enough.  It's a hard movie to get through.  The performances by each member of the cast are brilliant, the story moves quickly, the direction is teriffic, but the end and knowing that this is a true story make the movie hard to stomach.

1073750,5,6305800073,"When's the last time anyone dared to tackle such a subject? We already know that some of the details of Brandon Teena's life needed to be changed to make a concise and coherent film. There is no question that Brandon is not a nice person; he's a user, forger, thief, etc. Still, it's an interesting person around which Kimberly Peirce chose to center her first film. Certain elements of Brandon's life have been ""abbreviated"" but this was for the flow of the film's narrative. There is really no way anyone can fault Hilary Swank's brilliant performance. She was in practically every frame of the film; Chloe Sevigny brought out the sweetness and tenderness from Swank's character. She also personified the boredom of the lower class, mid-Western, stuck-in-a-rut, karaoke singing, girl at dead-end. There are people like this. It's frightening to think that previous reviewers don't believe it. It's a riveting film, and Hilary Swank gives one of the most courageous performances. Even if you don't believe the gender switch, Ms. Peirce's film is an important one. I love this film. There's ugliness, and it's dealt with appropriately. This IS a true story (edited for content), though a good display of red-neck culture. Most instructive. Most upsetting. Most enthrallng.

1073751,4,6305800073,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of those movies that can either leave you miserable and exhausted so that all you want to do is cry, or inspired and energized to go back out into the world and make a difference.  In both cases, it succeeds at being a gritty, realistic indictment on a society that places the external and materialistic aspects of life above the inner spirit we all have within us.  In doing so, it exposes the raw truth about a culture that has grown to hate, isnpired in part by the horrors we witness both at home, and at the movies.
Hilary Swank is luminous in an Oscar winning performance that not only transcends gender but also identity.  Her chilling Brandon Teena, raped, abused, taunted and despised for celebrating his own individuality and inner-beingness, is unforgettable. Chole Sivegny as the girl he charms with swagger and vulnerability, lends realism to an unflattering role that in someone else's hands could have been laughable.  These star-crossed, ill-fated lovers ooze true love, far more than most of today's movie duos.
As successful as the actors are in realizing their real life counterparts, the story, and its plot elements - all based on actual events - never fully do it justice.  At times you feel you're watching a terrific documentary, and then you're transported to a Lifetime-television-for-women-movie-of-the-week.  And if it's a terrific documentary you desire, rent or own the actual ""Brandon Teena Story"" which features an eerie soundtrack of the real Teena Brandon answering a detective's questions.
The magic of this film is in the message, and ultimately, ""Boys DOn't Cry"" succeeds as an expose on the hatred our society has imparted on those who are different, or outside the norm.  In doing so, it serves as a much needed testament for embracing our differences, celebrating our unique characteristics, and caring less about what others think of us and more about how we can change the world.
Brandon Teena was no martyr, and certainly not a saint.  But, in his short life, he made a difference by being who he was, and by allowing us a glimpse inside a full, rich heart.  This film accomplishes many things on many levels, but nothing startles as much as realizing that we all have our secrets, longings, and passions though few of us ever have the courage to make them our reality, like Brandon Teena briefly did.  Given the unprecedented events of September 11th and its aftermath, Brandon served notice years ago that society's hatreds had gone too far.  As a document of life before 9-11, this is a MUST-HAVE film.",1006819200,6,2572,4.876146788990826

Maybe it's coz I have seen her before on tv as a girl and I could not think of her as a guy.  I didn't thought she looklike a guy.  The movie is only base on the time she was in Falls City, when she meets Lana Teisdel, her friends and when she was rape and murder.  I had wish to see more about Teena life before, about her family.  I don't think this movie tell the real story of Teena Brandon, it was more fiction then anything.

1073753,4,6305800073,"This review contains spoilers.
This indie movie pushed Hilary Swank into the limelight.  Thankfully she proves that she is a lot better than 'The Karate Kid 2' and 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (the movie) might suggest.  Her fantastic performance is surprisingly unsentimental and in this immensely moving.  There are few actresses that could take on this role but Swank is perfect, and a lot better than Annette Bening was in 'American Beauty' (finally, it's nice to see the award going to the right person).  The fact that this was based on a real-life case makes it all the more poignant.
The basic plot is of a young lady called Teena Brandon struggling with her sexuality, and so dresses as a male under the pseudonym Brandon.  Her subsequent love affair with Lara (Chloe Sevigny) and tense meetings with her family make for difficult viewing.
Admitedly, at the start the movie is intriguing but a little slow-moving.  However, after the poignant affair between Brandon and his/her love Lara, it becomes entirely mesmerising.  All the way through though, you're nervous because of Brandon's inevitable discovery.  The rape scenes at the end are thankfully completely non-exploitive whilst certainly not lacking in horrifying drama.  The fact that this betrayal is carried out by Brandon's supposed friends makes it all the more terrible.

Somehow, director Kimberly Pierce has created a world so starkly realistic, that one feels as if one is there.  Hilary Swank is so very much Brandon, the character is...just IS.  Chloe Sevigny astonishes as well.  The entire cast simply 'live' their respective roles.
I find it odd that director Pierce was overlooked by the DGA in its nominations.  The film is a cautionary, all too vivid portait/tale of our times.  One does not easily forget, nor does one leave this film without, without a sense of awe, stunned disbelief and horror -- knowing how all too true the senselessness of ignorance remains, yet today.

I knew nothing about the Brandon Teena case, so watching the story unfold before my eyes was something of a shock. Hilary Swank won her well-deserved Oscar for playing a woman living as a man in rural Nebraska. She befriends two ex-cons who later strip, beat, rape, and finally murder her when they find out her true gender. It's a film that is not for all tastes, but if you can stomach the violence, then this film should be added to your ""must-see"" list.",1002240000,,533,4.393939393939394
1073757,3,6305800073,"I will join in giving this movie kudos on its production values. Right off hand, I can't think of any other independent movie that has matched this one in the areas of acting and direction.
But I found it very hard to be moved by the film for the single reason that the characterizations were too extreme. The ""white trash"" boys were too evil, and far too much effort was spent trying to get the audience riled up against their narrow-mindedness. And Brandon Teena was way too angelic and innocent; this was completely at odds with his criminal past and his facility at lying.
So by the time the dramatic climax came, I felt like I was watching propoganda. This sort of overboard rendition of the story does a disservice to the real lessons of the ordeal that Brandon endured.
[I might have rounded this rating up to four stars, but I ended up rounding it down because of the Featurette on the DVD version - it was downright offensive. In it, the filmmakers get on-screen and gush about how this was a story about ""individualism"" and ""living your own life no matter what other people think.""
In their desire to elevate Brandon to hero status, the filmmakers equate ""being out-of-control"" with ""being free"", a bad message to be sending. With respect to Brandon, this story has a lot more to do with how his confusion over his sexual identity led to confusion in the rest of life, and how this confusion led to bad decisions and self-destruction.]",997660800,17,1445,4.604651162790698
1073758,2,6305800073,"Real life events should have no bearing on the work of fiction except when the aforementioned work claims to be based on a true story. Boys Don't Cry claims to be based on the real life murder of Teena Brandon, but gets a lot of it wrong. The true life tragedy brought to the forefront a lot of issues involving poverty, domestic violence, violence against women, women's position in rural society to name a few. Unfortunately about 85% went unnoticed because the public eye immediately focused on the cross-dressing, gay bashing, political implication to the exclusion of everything else. This film takes the already narrow view of the story and strips it even more of the real person in it by transforming it into a traditional butch lesbian romance to the 80's New Wave of the Cure while the real person was mad about the square dancing and everything country and western to name one instance. The story is simplified further by reducing the motivation of the bad guys to simple ignorance and out of control anger. No sense is given of the protagonist's past or what drives him. Fictional scenes are added to make the marginal guys good and bad guys into people who could not help themselves. Also gone is the bravado, the arrogance and the flamboyance of the true life Brandon replaced by the strong solitude of the ""Karate Kid"" Hillary Swank. The actors are good, but the casting os off and the historical person who was tiny, slight and driven by nervous energy is replaced by a tall and reserved sailor/soldier type, creating a totally different feel. The director and the actors try hard, but they would have been much better off creating their own drama about a similar incident rather than trying to mimic history.",996796800,22,1724,4.75

Who knew that Hilary Swank was capable of this caliber acting? Seeing her in Beverly Hills, 90210 and even worse in Karate Kid 4 or something like that certainly would not have prepared anyone for this level of drama. Naturally it put Swank, the Oscar winner for best actress in 2000, on Hollywood's A-list. It was interesting also to see Lecy (does she do by Alicia now?)  Goranson of Roseanne fame in a role here since she has not much been seen since Roseanne days. Also Chloe Sevigny gives a stellar performance as the girlfriend of Swank's character (Brandon Teena). The truly sad part of this film, apart from the complete discrimination and fear people show of things they do not understand, is that the story is true and Brandon Teena ended up murdered in reality. Truly a tragic tale.",992131200,,920,4.644171779141105
1073831,5,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry is an oldfashioned ""lovestory"" with a ""trans-sexual"" protagonist and it was shot so that the viewer is on pins and needles until the inevitable tragedy blusters through the ""myopia"" of small town members who realize they haven't understood this creature or his/her life.
The sad thing about this story is that it has heavy undertones and chords of ""shame"" which are very sad and reach through to the audience with a searing flame like a public burning  and yet is shot (unlike the stylistic ""The Devils"" by Ken Russell) with a strong identification with the oppressors, the men, the ""ignorant masses"" which is to nearly pardon them-- the ones who would have lit a bonfire and placed the human Brandon like Joan of Arc before her in what were surely labelled ""cleansing flames"" (a sentence which I nearly gag writing, and something which I could not watch were it not necessary for human beings to face some very unpleasant realities if we are to expect and spread the anthem of ""real change"") as these men surely acted instinctually, yet here are potrayed as ""purging"" Brandon by making weapons, as in Kosovo, of their so-called ""manhoods.""
When Lana in the end, begins to look at the ""boyish"" Brandon in the light of day and we feel her ""doubts"" it might be highly realistic  (in fact this movie is uber realstic with surreal cinematic swatches that are window dressing) yet it also again makes Brandon's outsider status and loneliness more monstrous as the tragedy plays itself out, considering his ""idealistic"" love of her which would not be bound by common sense.
The cinematography, close ups galore of characters flawed faces, and the beauty of life without a vaseline lens works here like a Brueghel print and the commingling of humans and stark environments work beautifully in scenes such as when the dustbowel billows and the navigation involved in driving a car is lost in a mist reminiscent which loses contact with the asphalt beneath it, and loses contact with everything outside of the encapsulated doom of a car with as much navigational plausibility as an airplane trapped in the Bermuda Triangle.  Have I used the word trapped?
The director, on this first effort, has created a ""new realism"" which tries to ""understand"" from all angles and make the pieces which can never fit to do that, and what is accomplished is something of a struggle with feminine nature itself.  It is here, in the impossibility of a woman to NOT be at least ""buds"" and ""dudes"" with a man that the true pain of womanhood is brought to a head.
There is no room among the small town prejudices for an outsider like this, and even less room for a ""pervert"" like this and the strongest performance of all was turned in by Chloe Sevigny,  who as Lana indicated her awareness of the sick and twisted atmosphere by being the pivot around which it swirled.  Yet, she understood well enough that the society she kept and her mother's quite obvious religious feelings towards an ex-con like John were something more than dangerous.  Lana knew what it was to be trapped, and she was able to translate the anonymity and the stranglehold of her incapacity to Brandon who alive with love drew her to him/her in a way which could make fairy tales seem real and being from ""outside"" could offer a different perspective, tenderness, and love.
  The movie became caught in the throat of Brandon just looking at bad girl Lana, a primary reason to stay on in the little community he'd run away to long after the signs were pointing towards a swift getaway. Yet Lana was the one able to say ""I don't care if you're a martian"" (to paraphrase her response to Brandon's ""dilemna"") showing the LEAST need of a validating society.
The dead end lives of all these people (and the performances, all brilliant, not one less good than the next) could lead a person to pity, vexation, camaraderie, and abject hopelessness.
  There is no reason for them to find more or look further.  In a sense, there world and their lives work in a truncated manner because for them, that is ALL THERE IS.  And yet in moments of transcendence they are as open as the dusty highway, they come without batteries, and have nothing to add to their state as ""noble savages.""
  If the world worked the way they wanted it too, the way it had worked the day before the ""uncanny"" appeared in their midst in the guise of a happy go lucky young ""wet behind the ears"" kid who made the mistake of falling for the mythological pivotal loving ""bad girl"" Lana-- the archetype of Lilith and Magdalene blended in with the Virgin; one feels that they likely would have believed no REAL tragedy beyond the commonplace sorrows would ever have occurred in that place.
Much has been made of Hilary Swank's performance and after seeing THIS movie without visiting the ""documentary"" it is hard to see any other person, actually, NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to see another person in this role.  But when there are scenes that need a ""fiery"" ""touching"" sentience, and a ""glaring"" displeasure with the mundane realities it is not Brandon that understands the ""danger"" in being complacent in a world where no one dreams but Lana who's intelligence, and charisma could have charmed the socks off other sailors and sent them to their dooms too.
The touching quality of a ""karaoke torch song singer"" a ""klumsy t-shirted siren with a cow collection"" was a perfect ""human"" counterpoint and her ease with herself and her feelings were a foil and a sharp contrast to the clumsy Brandon who appeared as strange to the rules of life as he was to the rules of a body he had initially disdained.
 Even in the scene where Lana pays visit to a confused Teena in prison who is still muddled and has a hard time surveying and understanding the danger his/her presence might bring to those, as unfair as that might be, that must stay behind and live in the small pond world of ""Here"" Sevigny transmits a subdued, loving, and carefree ""girl in the know.""
For Brandon, young, in love, and a bit stilted as either a male or a female there was simply NO WAY OUT.  It is a great tragedy that some sick men who the director potrayed, in a hard edgy game as ""ordinary guys"" with ""severe problems"" provided the trapped young man on his journey inward with a permanent way out.",991440000,,6272,4.665760869565218

1073834,5,6305800073,":-------------------------------------------------- Warning : This review reveals critical plot points.
From what I've read and seen, Kimberly Pierce fell in love with Brandon Teena. It's that simple. She said as much on ""Charlie Rose"" and in different publications. It is this kind of forth-right and brave honesty that has allowed her to make such an amazingly powerful film.
Most of us already know about the awards and accolades. Hilary Swank acted her way to an Academy Award, Chloe Sevigny to a nomination. It made just about everyone's top 10 list. It got the Big Thumbs Up from Roger Ebert. It won Golden Globes and IFP/West Independent Spirit awards. The list goes on, multiple Film Fest inclusions, etc.
People - there is a reason for all the hoop-la.
This is, quiet honestly, the most powerful film to hit the American landscape since ""Deer Hunter"".
It is brutal in it's honesty and highly emotional in it's story-telling.
Hilary Swank ( previously known for a stint on ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and a starring role in ""The Next Karate Kid"" ) deserves every award she's been given. She turns in a standing-ovation of a performance. Nuanced and gentle, swaggering and tough, you will believe that people accepted Brandon as a man, there's no doubt. Hilary Swank became Brandon Teena, they are inseparable.
Chloe Sevigny ( from ""Kids"" and more recently ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" and ""American Psycho"" ) also turns in an amazing performance as Brandon's girlfriend.
There is raw emotion and electricity traveling between these young actresses and it lights up the screen.
The vision, though, belongs to Kimberly Pierce. She's done an outstanding job directing this film - allowing it to be both brutal ( the rape scene ) and beautiful ( Lana and Brandon making love ).
I walked away feeling drained, and I will admit it, a little depressed. I couldn't talk about the film for days, it moved me so personally.
You may end up shaking your head, unbelieving, but this is a true story, based on real people. That makes it all the more touching.
This film is highly recommended. It's one of the best Independent ( or mainstream for that matter ) Films ever made.
You will be moved, that is certain.

That is one of the plusses of independent movies, they can take alternative approaches and risks with the film direction that would never see the light of day in the well-established, tried-and-true, set-in-stone methods of Hollywood filmmaking.  This is not a movie for the squeamish.  The film is very graphic in several ways. The love scene between Swank and Sevigny is pretty eye-opening and adds tremendously to the film's stark realism, a realism which made this film so effective and memorable, and adds so much weight to the final scene that hits you like a sledgehammer. Once Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon's true identity is discovered, her situation deteriorates rapidly and what follows gets pretty hard to watch, and the images will not soon leave your mind.  After watching the film I felt similar to how I felt after watching ""Schindler's List"" and ""American Beauty"" - it was a good movie that needs to be seen, but I didn't want to watch it a second time.",990230400,,1100,4.994535519125683
1073836,5,6305800073,"Boys don't cry is a powerful portrayal of the life of a young woman experiencing sexual identity crisis. Based on a true story it depicts the events in the life of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) offering a thought provoking insight into alternate lifestyles. It delves into the human psyche and combs the inner labyrinths of the human mind to discover some shocking truths very rarely dealt with in the real world. It confronts our deep-rooted fear of accepting the unusual and laments the prevalent intolerance and prejudices that very much are a part of our lopsided system of morals and social conduct. It broadens our horizons and provides us with a more compassionate view towards alternate lifestyles urging us to question the existing hypocrisy and social taboos and view our moral stand in a different light. It is the story of stoic courage, the courage it takes to make a choice and stand by it; the courage it takes to be yourself fighting all odds and overcoming the gnawing fear of rejection. It is the story of hope, of love, of gaining triumph over all your fears and doubts to emerge as the person you want to be and live as. It is also a saga of pain and suffering caused by constant rejection and the clash between the inner spirit and that tamed by the society. The narrative begins as a forthright and moving portrayal of the confused mind of Teena Brandon who feels like a man trapped in a woman's body. As we start understanding Teena Brandon we are introduced to a group of wild, self - destructive youngsters living everyday in a drug - induced stupor. This becomes Brandon's newest circle of friends. Here Brandon also finds true love when he meets Lana (Academy Award nominee for best supporting actress - Chloe Sevigny). For the first time in his life Brandon finds himself embraced by a person who loves him defiantly and accepts him completely with the earnest compassion of a true soul mate. This sets off a bizarre chain of events and as the narrative gathers momentum the stage is set for an intense climax to explode. The culmination of this very powerful drama is shocking, unnerving and thought provoking all at the same time. Hilary Swank renders a heart-warming performance for which she won the Academy Award for best actress. Chloe Sevigny is charming with her lucid acting style and fluid grace.",989625600,3,2333,4.7346437346437344

As for Ms. Sevigny, she was brilliant, although one can't make a very good case for her with Angelina Jolie against her for her equally haunting performance, in GIRL INTERUPTED. Sorry Chloe, Angelina was just great. Over all, an incredibly disturbing film, which probobly should have been rated NC-17.

1073917,5,6305800073,"Roger Ebert said in his review that this story - based on true events - could have been handled badly - could have gone wrong at many turns - but everything was handled just right, and I couldn't agree more.
From the start, even those unfamiliar with the documentary surrounding this dramatization will feel the essential sense of fatality and inevitability that drive this tragic tale to its logical end as it begins its slow progression from a quirky slice-of-life comedy to a dark study of many conflicting characters and a powerful social commentary.
A second viewing will reveal still further what a finely crafted gem this picture is. The reality-based events are placed as strategic set-pieces with a sometimes warped chronology and given fascinating spins - I don't know how much artistic license was employed (I imagine it must have been a lot) but fully justifiable for such a satisfying end result. The documentary is the shell and THIS is the filling, the substance, the meaning. The questions that arise from any study of this case are ANSWERED here, in a very satisfying way.
There is phenomenal acting on display here in all roles particularly the lead (Hilary Swank).
And before I leave, I must mention the masterful dialog utilized in this film - It strikes the perfect balance between believability and significance. Lines are as realistic as possible within the context they're spoken yet still allow characters to say what NEEDS to be said - I'm talking about PROFUNDITY with a capital P.

Boys Don't Cry has a feel to it you know stirs inside a part of you that is very afraid...very buried and doesn't want to surface.  The movie is a true story with the creepiest elements of over-entitled male mentality, along with social biases against a girl who so strongly feels invested in being the opposite gender.  The movie is first and foremost, a poignant love story...and then a case against society for their close-minded and sick fears about when someone doesn't fit in the box made for him or her.  The movie can at times be gruesome and if you're in touch with yourself at all, it will take a lot of energy out of you.",987379200,2,679,4.540983606557377

Score: 91/100
Boys Don't Cry, huh? It's got a director we've never heard of, a bunch of new actors and a story about a sexual identity crisis. It doesn't sound very appealing. But, what cinema-goers around the world have got out of this little masterpiece is much more than you'd expect, and Boys Don't Cry has quickly become one of the best independent films of the `90's.
Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank) is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. Life is good for Brandon, now that he's one of the guys and dating hometown beauty Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny). However, he's forgotten to mention one important detail. It's not that he's wanted in another town for GTA and other assorted crimes, but that Brandon Teena is actually a woman named Teena Brandon. When Brandon's best friends make this discovery, his life eventually is ripped apart by betrayal, humiliation, rape, and murder.
This moving and unexpected story is bought to life by a marvellous script by Kimberley Pierce and Andy Bienen; all the scenes are worth watching and all the dialogue is excellently thought-out. Pierce, who also directs, shows excellent potential, the rape scene in particular captures her brilliance and taut direction. The performances are all masterful; Hilary Swank who wins a well-deserved Oscar for her role as Brandon Teena; Chloe Sevigny who was nominated for an Oscar and should've won, her performance burns in the memory. Also some acting and small efforts that went unnoticed in Boys Don't Cry make it more worth watching, including Peter Sarsgaard's portrayal of the horribly nice-guy-turned bad John Lotter and also Nathan Larson for his haunting score.
Groundbreaking performances, immaculate direction and a stunningly brutal script make Boys Don't Cry an unmissable first feature.",984787200,5,1960,5.090062111801243
1073920,5,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry seems like a hundred other exploitive teen films as the film credits roll over scenes from Nebraska small town nightlife. Its a world of young working people, not long out of high school. Happy at being freed from parental constraints they seek thrills at after-bar-parties. There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and high speed chases in cars.
The familiar scenario becomes less so with the appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an extremely un-macho high school male.
Hilary Swank, the actress who portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if suspiciously predictable story.
Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she is having a lot of difficulty there. Her attempts at bedding a member of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.
Teena hits on a solution. She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city: Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a shine to her. Teena fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy. At least she fools them for awhile. Our 21 year old leading character has reversed her name to become Brandon Teena.
She takes up with a group of twenty somethings and two older males who gather around the broken household of a divorced woman and her daughter Lana. Teena is smitten with Lana. And gradually, Lana gets interested in Teena.
This is a love story, a long love story. The gender ""problem"" is childs play for Teena to handle at first. But gradually, the ""family"" begins to have doubts about Brandon Teena. The story is delicately told. It is a surprise to see the storys sexual details revealed so explicitly. Though the explicitness lengthens the movie, I think director Kimberley Peirce and her co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.
The third act is extremely long. The nature of Teena's romance with Lana is dawning. There will be consequences. The mostly true story has a powerful ending. The scenario is a little too perfect, however. It is obvious the real story has been ""cooked"" slightly to strike the right moral: Homophobes are bad. I suspect Brandon's real experience in 1993 Falls City was quite a bit more complex.
The central characters are extremely well rendered. The story is superb even if it is a touch too long. Hilary Swank's young man trapped in a girl's body is extraordinary. Her performance reminds me very much of the young and innocent Judy Garland of the late 30s and early 40s. The actress doesn't look that male. Her innocence is thus key to putting over this extremely complex character. Miss Swank does it smashingly. I will be very disappointed if she does not become as big a star as Garland became.",982627200,9,2930,4.792490118577075

Hilary Swank did a superb job in this movie and Kimberly Pierce must have had some huge balls to direct such a controversial film. Chloe Sevigny's acting was beyond your average Joe. I was in tears by the time the movie ended. It deals with the cruelty of human actuality.

1073922,5,6305800073,"Imagine---you're a smalltown girl in the heartland of the US, canning spinach for a living, with an alcoholic mom.  The guys in town get drunk and ""bumper-ski"" for fun.  Along comes a stunning young man, quiet, soft-spoken, who fights for your friend's honor in a bar on his first night in town.  He talks about taking you away from all this---then the dream starts to unravel as all the signs start pointing toward a secret.  The young man you've fallen for is , biologically speaking, a woman.
I first saw ""Boys Don't Cry"" at the Reel Affirmations film festival in Washington, DC.---the first time it had been shown to a primarily queer audience and it floored me.  By now, lots of people are aware of this fabulous film (one of those rare ""crossover"" hits that is popular with gay & straight audiences).  Granted, it is not 100% true to the original story.  For instance, the name ""Brandon Teena"" is a fabrication by activists.  Teena Brandon never used that particular name during hir life.  It is impossible for us to determine what terminology s/he would have used if s/he had been in a more open environment or had lived longer.  Regardless, the movie is an anguishing love-story-gone-wrong.
An issue that is often raised around this film is the director's decision to put Lana at the scene of the crime.  Kimberly Peirce (the director) spoke to the audience about this at the film festival.  She extensively interviewed Lana and many of the others involved in the actual events.  Apparently, Lana's statements were greatly conflicted around this issue.  Lana's ""standard"" statement had been that she had called the house where Brandon was staying from a local gas station/convenience mart.  However, phone records showed that no phone calls had been made from that phone around the right time..  Her other statements had similar holes; thus, Peirce made the decision to explore an alternative situation.  There is a great deal of artistic license taken with the storyline, but this does not detract from the film's effect.
The actors, of course, are terrific---with the side effect that it now turns my head to see Hilary Swank in a female role (in other movies).  I am surprised to see other reviewers flinching at the nudity, violence, etc.  I  doubt anyone went into this film without knowing how it was going to end.  You must realize that even in the US, violence of this level is perpetrated on a daily basis for reasons as various religion, skin color, sexual orientation and gender identity.  I can only hope that this film will open people's minds, eyes, and hearts.",980640000,3,2583,4.835990888382688
1073923,5,6305800073,"Probably the most important film of last year, ""Boys Don't Cry"" takes an unflinching look at sexual identity and the disturbingly monstrous hate crimes that topic can, on occasion, inspire.  Brandon Teena, as portrayed by Hilary Swank, is no pillar of virtue.  In fact, she's presented as a dishonest thief who spends her life telling lies to get what she wants.  That's what makes this film so devastating, its truthful representation of all these characters as deeply flawed human beings careening toward inevitable tragedy.  The senselessness of the hate crime resonates deeply, and hopefully will make everyone take a breath and think twice about their own levels of tolerance.  Hateful thoughts lead to hateful speech which leads to hateful actions.

1073925,5,6305800073,"Every so often a true story makes its way to our screens. More often than not it's a tale of a battler winning against insurmountable odds, or of the way tragedy can bring a community closer. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a true story of a very different kind.
In 1993, Brandon Teena was raped and murdered following the discovery by his friends that he was a female - Teena Brandon. Six years later the exploration of the relationships and events leading up to the murder creates one of the most uniquely rewarding cinema experiences of recent years.
Sitting through the film is a harrowing experience to say the least. We know the outcome - even with no prior knowledge of the story it is clear from the outset that there is no happy ending in sight - and throughout the film all we can do is wait while Brandon speeds toward his death. Frightening in its certainty, it creates a palpable tension which doesn't leave the viewer until ong after the film.
Hilary Swank's portrayal of Brandon is indeed a superlative performance. Her transformation for the role is complete and riveting. Chloe Sevigny - playing Brandon's girlfriend Lana - is arresting also and is likewise worthy of praise. The remaining cast (particularly the two male leads) imbue their roles with tangible dimension, creating a realism seldom found in contemporary cinema.
Kimberly Peirce's direction artfully reinforces the underlying themes of the work. This is the first film I've seen in which time-lapse photography is used for thematic effect rather than as a visual stunt. Peirce thankfully avoids sensationalism. Any graphic scenes are handled deftly, illustrating not only her reverence for the story but her ability to create truly visceral cinema.
Many will find it a torturous experience, but undoubtedly one worthenduring.

1073997,3,6305800073,"I admit that I did fast forward through the lesbian-sex scene and rape scenes of ""Boys Dont Cry.""  I got the point that the two young women were in love and, in the rape scene, that two dark, ignorant rednecks were evil.  I found some of the middle scenes of the flick to be tedious.  If I had been in a theater, I'd have shook my head or gone for a coke during parts.
But, the theme was critical:  tolerance.  It came out loud and clear and is a contemporary message important to us all.  I felt a connection with Brandon and sincerely felt her poignant search for what is right.  She states after the torrid love scene outside the factory that ""I thought that I had finally figured out who I was.""  Brandon is honestly having a ""sexual identity crisis"" and pulls the viewer into her plight.  I really questioned parts of my own identity after viewing Brandon's.
Most intriguing is the mother figure in this story.  When first introduced, she is portrayed as a drunk, irresponsible, unemployed ""adult.""  But as the plot continues, she unashamedly confronts the soon-to-be murderers about their intentions to attack Brandon (a threat to their manhood and way of life).  These two gooks could easily have ""whacked"" her also, but she courageously stands her ground.  As this mother, in the final scene, is shown with her arm around the young lover of Brandon (her daughter), I admitted to myself that she was truly the most sane character in the entire cast.  She gently takes her daughter from the murder scene into a quieter place.  She has stayed with her daughter throughout the whole ordeal.  Lying drunk on the couch at 2 am in one of the opening scenes, she NOW has become fully engaged in her daughter's life and future.",975110400,7,1726,4.591503267973856

The story itself is only an average re-telling of real events and it seems rather disjointed when taken at face value.  The viewer is supposed to feel Brandon Teena's confusion and emotional highs and lows, but the writing only partly succeeds in that endeavor with the best writing coming toward the end of the picture.  Although the technical aspects of the film were average at best, the individual performances more than make up for any weaknesses.  Hilary Swank's performance as Brandon was absolutely stunning.  Her Academy Award win was very well deserved and it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a better performance in American film.  The fact that the Academy chose not to award Chloe Sevigny's performance in this film is something of a travesty given the incredible talent she possesses and the wonderful chemistry she and Swank have on film. Even with a supporting cast of relatively unknown actors, the performances were not hindered in any way.

1074000,3,6305800073,"I will say the acting was great, Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny did a terrific job and I believe they captured the spirits of Teena Brandon and Lana Tisdel.

My problem is how a lot of events that really happened were altered or ignored.  Teena Brandon's life was a lot more than the couple of weeks before she was brutally raped and murdered by two ""friends.""

Also, a third person (named Philip Devine) was murdered in the house.  They did not give Teena's murdered friend (played by Roseanne's Lecy Goransen) much attention, and didn't even use her real name.  It was like they wanted to sensationalize the fact that Teena Brandon was a lesbian and completely forgot about the two straight people who died.

Another problem I have with this movie is how it drags.  They try too hard to make them sound uneducated, and some of the accents are too far-fetched.

Finally, Lana Tisdel is not reported to have been at the murder scene.  It is just too ridiculous to believe that she was there and lived.  John Lotter and Thomas Nissen almost killed a baby!

A lot of this film is about sexual obsession.  It's clear John Lotter was murderous because he was obsessed with Lana, and that was probably true in real life.  The rape was horribly violent, and caused me a lot of distress to see.

The sheriff's treatment of the young, frightened victim was also horrifying - because the unspoken message was ""You're a dyke, you needed it, get over it and shut up.""

Director  Kimberly Peirce has captured America's heartland in full detail: the  distubing beauty of its vastness and the ignorance of some of its people.  Whereas Brandon Teena would have been accepted in most large cities, he was  shunned in isolated Nebraska. The uncaring attitude of the local law  enforcement officials enraged me and I I hope the Sheriff of Falls City  realizes that he has Brandon's blood on his hands. I saw Chloe Sevigny in  ""AMERICAN PSYCHO"" and her performance here is vastly superior.  Hilary Swank has made her Brandon the performance of a lifetime.

Brandon, not Teena, who the audience sees, as he struggles with his

1074185,4,6305800073,"The most impressive aspect of `Boys Don't Cry' is that it refuses to shy away from the sordid details of much of its protagonist's life, yet manages to convert her (or him if you prefer) into a sympathetic and comprehensible  figure. In our most honest moments, we can all acknowledge aspects of our  own lives and personalities that we don't understand, that we would love to  change and that often make us feel alienated from the `norm' of society at  large. In the case of Teena Brandon - a young man `trapped' in a woman's  body - the anomaly happens to be a more pronounced and certainly less  socially acceptable one than most of us are forced to endure in our lives.  And she paid the ultimate price society demands from those it fears and  does not understand: she was murdered in Nebraska in 1993, simply for being  `different.'
The film builds a convincing case for compassionate  understanding without converting Brandon into a saint-like figure. Not only  do we witness the petty criminality of her life, but we see her propensity  for duplicity and deception, a personality trait that actually leads in  part to many of the troubles she encounters, playing a crucial role to a  large extent even in her death itself. Yet, given society's out-of-hand  rejection of transgendered people, what real options but a life of  dishonesty is Brandon really given? Similarly, Lana, the young woman with  whom Brandon falls in love and the one person who has ever accepted Brandon  unconditionally for what she is, suffers from a number of her own  demons.
Credit writer/director Kimberly Pierce and co-writer Andy Bienen  for not taking the easy commercial path of reducing the moral complexities  of the personalities involved to a black-and-white world where good and  evil are displayed in neatly arranged patterns for our easy consumption.  There are many times in this film when literally none of the people we are  involved with are the slightest bit appealing. The filmmakers, in their  faith in our maturity, ask us to go along on a pretty harrowing journey at  times, but it is one that leads us to a very rewarding destination. The  scenes in which Brandon's companions expose her secret is riveting and  terrifying in its dramatic intensity and human sadness. The utter  humiliation Brandon is forced to endure at the hands of the hooligans who  are tormenting her broadens to become a symbolic representation of every  person who has suffered such an injustice at the hands of unreasoning  ignorance for whatever reason. It is a chilling reminder of the danger of  the mob mentality unrestrained by empathy and enlightenment.
Like so many  of the best off-Hollywood independent productions, `Boys Don't Cry' finds  its truth in two crucial elements: the canny depiction of the bleak  sterility and stifling provincialism of its Midwest setting and the  uniformly first-rate performances by a largely unknown set of  actors.
Hilary Swank, in her Oscar-winning turn as Brandon, and Chloe  Sevigny as Lana achieve a naturalism in their portrayals that neutralizes  any theatricality that might have robbed the film of its indispensable  quality of immediacy and believability. They convert what might, in less  capable hands, have become little more than a sensationalized freak show  into a powerful and understandable drama about real, thoroughly  recognizable human beings. For that alone, `Boys Don't Cry' becomes a  cinematic experience impossible to forget.",964310400,11,3475,5.0725663716814156

The director of this film really captured the ugliness of this horrible  scenario that occurred in Nebraska in late 1993. In a way this movie was  hard for me to watch, but it really touched me. There are two reasons I did  not rate this a five star film..first,  is that Philip DeVine, one of the  of the actual victims of the crime, was cut entirely out of the film and  never mentioned. Second, I didn't like that Lana Tisdel (portrayed by Chloe  Sevigny in the film) was seen present at the murders, when in truth she was  not present. Overall, a very good movie with five star performances.",964224000,2,736,4.5227272727272725
1074187,1,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I thought that Hillary Swank's portrayal of Brandon Teena was over-rated. It seems like if you play a character that kisses someone of the opposite sex or  someone that's physically challenged, then the Academy automatically hands  you an Oscar. Look at Swank, you already knew she was going to win the  Oscar before the actually ceremony. I feel that her performance wasn't  Oscar worthy! Based on a true story, Swank plays a character by the name of  Brandon Teena, a transexual on the run (don't know why?). He/she falls in  love with a young woman named Lana (played by Chloe Sevigny). Being new in  town, Brandon befriends a group of people, mainly guys. When they discover  his/her little secret, you can imagine the Southerners reactions. Chloe  Sevigny did a good job playing Lana. When I watched this, there were 8 of  us. We were all ready to go somewhere, but we kept saying, ""5 more  minutes"" to each other. It was like, we had to watch it. At the end,  we all looked at each other and said that it was a horrible movie!",964137600,7,1097,4.484848484848484
1074188,5,6305800073,"I was rooting for Annette Bening on Oscar night but I hadn't seen Swank play Brandon Teena.  After I did, I realized she mowed down every actress in competition with her for the 2000 Oscar race for 1999 films.  You could  swear Swank is a boy but, when you see her as a girl, you believe that  also, albeit as a girl who should have been born a boy.  In the love  scenes, Swank is especially convincing as a teen girl's boyfriend, which  hardly seems possible because she's really a girl herself.  This movie will  really shake you up though so I wouldn't advise seeing it at the end of a  bad day.  Brandon hangs around with mostly society's dregs in the heartland  and that forecasts her short future as much as her being born the wrong sex.

1074192,4,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry is one of the most intense and devastating movies I've seen in a long while.  The feelings of hope and longing, and their counterparts  - despair and disillusionment - that so often are part of a homosexual's  life are very well described.  As the story develops it becomes clear that  it will lead to an unhappy ending, but to which extent its ending will be  an unhappy one is hard to imagine till one gets to it.  Whether the movie  accurately reports what happened in real life or not, does not make its  fatal outcome any less tragic.  The acting in Boys Don't Cry is superb.  In fact, along with the plot, I find the acting to be one of the movie's  strongest and most valuable aspects: all actors and actresses in this film  deserve to be highly praised, but especially - I will admit - Hilary Swank.
However, Boys Don't Cry has its weak points as well: one of them is its  cinematography, which I found by no mean up to the movie's standards: the  visual language is, in my opinion, dull, and at times even ridiculous in  its mocking of modernistic techniques that simply clash in the otherwise  conventional context.  The soundtrack too could have been better planned.  That's why I decided to rate this film ""four stars"" and not a full five.  Overall, I guess, Boys Don't Cry was more concerned with content than with  form.  And when it comes to content, one most certainly has plenty think  about after watching this remarkable movie.
In the year of the World Gay  Pride, I wish Boys Don't Cry - or a film of the same caliber - had been  chosen as an emblem of  the psychological, social and material traumas  homosexuals are still confronted with in our society, in the year 2000.",962928000,4,1708,4.478827361563518

Both Hilary's and Chole's performances are nothing short of genius.  Kimberly Peirce's direction took both the cast and audience through a  cornicopia of emotions.  From the sheer joy I felt for Brandon as he found  a place that he felt he could call home to the absolute terror of the rape  scene, my heart broke for him several times as his story unfolded.
Above everything else that has been said about this movie, I think the  one message that came through loud and clear was the basic human need to  label people.  Wheather the label be man or woman, gay or straight, love or  hate.
BUY THIS MOVIE!  Show it to your friends and family.  No matter  what your personal feelings are towards the subject matter of this story,  please, please, PLEASE let's not forget Brandon's life and allow history to  repeat itself.

1074194,4,6305800073,"We Americans have a low tolerance for non-conforming sexuality. Director Kimberly Peirce presents us with yet another example of our inability to accept someone in our midst who is not like us. In the setting of this  movie there is actually little tolerance for any deviation. You need to be  tough, to drink, to enjoy the most primitive forms of recreation. Others  have said that the protagonist Teena Brandon had fallen in with trailer  trash, but she didn't just fall in with them. She was born into that  setting, and played the same role (In real life she was a bigger thief than  the movie indicated). If her parents had been wealthy, and she had been a  student at Harvard she most likely wouldn't have been part of the world  that destroyed her.
Teena Brandon becomes Brandon Teena because she  doesn't belong in the body that she was born with. She tries desperately to  find some happiness in assuming the role of a male. The movie is  unremittingly bleak. None of the characters is remotely close to being  happy. There is not one single moment of humor in this two-hour film. The  only way Director Peirce could have made the movie more somber would be to  have filmed it in black and white. There are no heroes in this movie; even  the best of them fail to support one another at some point. Brandon's new  friend Lana leaves him stranded on a lonely road, at night, in the middle  of nowhere. Candace takes Brandon in, but can't help babbling to the bad  guys. Lana's drunken sot of a mother at last finds poor Brandon to be the  one person in the world that she feels she can look down on.
We often go  to ""feel good"" movies to see characters who really come through  for one another when the chips are down. We cry in happiness that such  people exist, and that everyone is happy in the end. You may cry during  this movie, but it will be in shame for the terrible things that we are  capable of doing to one another.",962496000,10,1935,4.4164305949008495

1074237,5,6305800073,"I was at first puzzled that director Kim Peirce had placed Lana at the murder scene, but I realized later that it was her way of showing Lana's love for Brandon. Lana never felt deceived even as Brandon, standing in his  jail cell fully aware there is nothing he can say or do to hide the fact  that he is a woman, looks painfully into her eyes to hear her say, ""I  don't care."" In their own way, it was a cheerful, loving moment of  their relationship. Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana,  it was the beginning.
The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt  compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were  human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce  painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a  moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the  smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the  characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell.
Even as  Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor  anger at the rapists who were once his friends. It was a venting of the  frustration of their inability to be what they don't know how -- that only  Brandon was able to do -- be loving. From their broken homes, respect for  women, or even for themselves, was never on the list.

1074240,1,6305800073,"I think that most accounts of real stories (including this one) are meant firstly, to be informative; secondly, to be artistic.  Indeed, everyone should learn about the hatred and violence that is directed at people with  alternative sexualities.  People who are inclined to hold such views could  certainly benefit from viewing such a film.  After seeing this movie,  anyone with blood in their veins should be able to find simpathy for people  like the main character, Teena Brandon: a lesbian who takes on a  traditional male gender. However, one must be somewhat familiar with a  story before choosing to view it in the form of a two hour film.  Furthermore, a potential viewer must also have some previous interest in  the subject matter.  It seems to me that anyone who would watch this movie  would already be understanding of the various sexualities which are  practiced today.  They are aware of, and disgusted with, crimes committed  against their participants.  I calculate that these are exactly the people  who do not need to see such a gruesome movie to understand the message it  conveys.  I found this movie extremely disturbing and certainly, the most  sad movie I have ever seen.

I  was so saddend by how it all ended for Brandon, mostly because he finally  found what HE wanted love.  I feel that the movie portrayed the  relationship between Brandon and Lana as sensual and beautiful, it put  things in a new light for me.
It is so sad that in today's society that  hate crimes are so common, it is hard to believe that we live a in a world  that breed people who tie men to truck bumpers and drag the life out of  them because of the color of skin, or the people that tie a young man to a  fence post and brutally kill him for who he chooses to love, and where  children can go into classrooms and kill other children in cold blood and  espcially when a person can be brutally raped over and over again and then  killed for who they truly are.

1074242,5,6305800073,"Our society is terribly skeptical and judgmental about differences that  dwell within it.  Mostly, it is in our nature to reject and fear what is  foreign and indistinguishable to us.  We flee from the unknown, like  cowards.  Even children are more courageous and willing to discover the  unlearned, new experiences they've been warned to avoid. Presumably, we  must be a civilized society, gifted with reason, equity, and compassion.  Yet we react like savages upon gaining knowledge of something that we were  completely unfamiliar with before, something that happens to be somewhat  different from us.  We fear what is strange, and it is only our own  feelings and perceptions that are not alien to us, and that we are  accustomed to regarding as ""normal.""  We refuse to believe in mind's  disagreement with nature.  What is created by nature, by the highest  powers, is not to be doubted or resented.  This widely accepted belief  deprives us of exploring our inner selves and restricts our freedom to  express our state of mind in the open.  For example, people are immediately  assigned to the gender category based on the sex organs they are born with,  and are expected to take on the socially constructed gender roles that are  considered appropriate for the members of that particular sexual category.  This is usually the logical way to categorize the newcomers to this world,  since they are unable to make decisions on their own.  However, if later in  life people become uncomfortable with the gender that they had been  ""assigned"" to at birth, they should be granted the freedom to make their  own choice, and be given the same amount of respect and support that they  had before making this choice.  Although biologically a female,  Brandon feels more comfortable being a male, and therefore dresses and acts  like one, and succeeds in deceiving young girls about ""his"" true -  biological - gender.  (We must use a male pronoun in referring to Brandon  Teena, for his personal choice of identity must be respected.)  Brandon saw  himself as no other than a heterosexual male.  He could make his body  sufficiently indistinguishable to allow him to pass as a man.  Brandon,  the main character, was naturally gentle and sensitive; he was comfortable  and at ease with women, who were, in return, charmed by his charisma.  He  had quite a reputation in being a womanizer. However, after some time upon  arriving to Kansas, Brandon falls in love with a girl named Lana.  For her,  Brandon is a mysterious cowboy-knight, who comes to her rescue.  She is  fascinated by Brandon's romanticism, and sees him as a sensitive, caring  young man - a man that is completely different from those violent and  disrespectful drunkards that mostly inhabit in Falls City.  At first, Lana  knows nothing about Brandon's true gender.  It is only later in the movie,  when they make love and Brandon leans over her, exposing the indefinite  outline of his elastic band-bound breasts through the neckline of his  T-shirt, when Lana develops some suspicions.  Nonetheless, there is a  definite stretch of when she actually acknowledges Brandon's gender, for  she does not really want to know; she wants to love Brandon without going  into details of his personal life.  Romance here is built on veiled  illusion, and the unconditional love of two people - Brandon and Lana -  embraces this illusion that had been created by them in all its bare  beauty.  Lana accepts him despite the harsh disapproval and disgust of her  mother.  Lana even defends Brandon and covers him by declaring that she had  personally seen Brandon's male sex organ, when he is first accused of lying  about his gender.  She trusts him enough, or just wants to hold on to her  comforting illusion, not to check his genitals, when she is forced to  privately make sure he is not lying about being a male.  We also meet a  couple of Lana's friends, John and Tom.  Tom and John are presented beyond  the murderers' scale - as devices of utmost ignorance and ruthless monsters  of hell.  They seem not to have any goals in life; their only joy is  alcohol and hanging out with friends.  They are hostile and totally lack  manners.  But even so, Brandon tries to look up to them, for Tom and John  are the only male role models that are in his sight at the moment.  Brandon, though with faint bravery, participates in all the activities that  his new male friends do, tries to fit in within their male circle.  John  and Tom accept him at first, although consider him very fragile, weak, and  rather feminine, for Brandon is smooth-skinned, lean, and practically has  no visible muscles.  However, after learning about Brandon's true gender  from the police, they, in front of Lana's mother, cruelly bare Brandon of  his clothes from the waist down.  Lana, in terror and pain, swiftly covers  her eyes and walks out of the bathroom where Brandon is about to be  humiliated and his undefended flesh is to be exposed to everyone; she chose  not to see what was really there.  She wants to love the Brandon that she  met, and therefore does not allow anyone to destroy her sweet illusion.  The two ruthless, spiteful bastards, overjoyed with their inconceivable  discovery, drive Brandon to an old mill, brutally rape him, taking turns,  and beat him unconscious.  As it turns out, when Brandon is at the  police station, he was a virgin before the rape, and this violent  penetration caused a great deal of pain and bleeding for him.  The  questions that Brandon is asked by the police officers are obviously rather  painful to him and make him uncomfortable.  For he sits in the police  ""torment room"" with his arms crossed, tears pouring from his eyes, down the  bruised and swollen face; he looks violated and scared like a guinea pig.  When Brandon is bluntly asked why he dresses and acts like a member of the  opposite sex and what is it that he is going through, he squeezes through  clenched teeth and tears, ""Gender identity crisis.""  This is probably the  first time that Brandon is forced to face and name his behavior.  It was  something that he did not want to discuss or look into, even in his mind.  He is stripped of his privacy, his integrity, and his human rights. At the  end, John and Tom do not let Brandon get away with this mischief and they  shoot him.  Indeed, we can bravely declare that Boys Don't Cry is not the  common ""happy end"" American movie that we are all so greatly accustomed to  - not that we are hungry for tragedy, but sometimes, we need reality, we  long to face the inescapable bitter truth.  Boys Don't Cry is based on a  true story and deals with real human issues of real people that don't  always live happily ever after...  Also, one of the many appealing virtues of  this movie is that not once does it mention the tiresome phrase, that has  become a clich, ""I am a man trapped in a woman's body."" Personal  identity is what's particular about a person.  It includes those qualities  that distinguish one person from another and the consciousness of one's own  being or identity.  Everyone aims to be somewhat different from others, to  find some qualities within themselves that would make them unique.  And  yet, most people are horrified by others' shocking differences, and find  those people deviant.  Gender identity, in particular, is a crucially  important issue that concerns people of all ages today, and is especially  acute among adolescents and young adults.  Since identity is the feeling of  who you are, your individual perception of self, and gender refers to being  male or female, biologically belonging to a particular sexual category,  then gender identity would most correctly be defined as an individual's  perception of his/her gender, despite biological factors and social  concepts.  One's self-perception may not necessarily correlate with his/her  biological sexual organs.  It is a state of mind.  It cannot be judged or  ranked, for all of us are created equal, even if we are different from one  another.",960508800,2,8045,4.82140221402214

1074375,4,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry seems like a hundred other exploitive teen films as the film credits roll over scenes from Nebraska small town nightlife. Its a world of young working people, not long out of high school. Thrilled with  being freed from parental constraints they seek thrills at  after-bar-parties. There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the  occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and  high speed chases in cars.
The familiar scenario becomes less so with the  appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an  extremely un-macho high school male.
Hilary Swank, the actress who  portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if  suspiciously predictable story.
Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but  she is having a lot of difficulty there. Her attempts at bedding a member  of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who  lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against  her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.
Teena hits on a  solution. She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city:  Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a  shine to her. Teena fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy. At  least she fools them for awhile. Our 21 year old leading character has  reversed her name to become Brandon Teena.
She takes up with a group of  twenty somethings and two older males who gather around the broken  household of a divorced woman and her daughter Lana. Teena is smitten with  Lana. And gradually, Lana gets interested in Teena.
This is a love story,  a long love story. The gender ""problem"" is childs play for Teena  to handle at first. But gradually, the ""family"" begins to have  doubts about Brandon Teena. The story is delicately told. It is a surprise  to see the storys sexual details revealed so explicitly. Though the  explicitness lengthens the movie, I think director Kimberley Peirce and her  co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.
The third act is  extremely long. The nature of Teena's romance with Lana is dawning. There  will be consequences. The mostly true story has a powerful ending. The  scenario is a little too perfect, however. It is obvious the real story has  been ""cooked"" slightly to strike the right moral: Homophobes are  bad. I suspect Brandon's real experience in 1993 Falls City was quite a bit  more complex and less likely to lead the audience to these  ""right"" conclusions.
The central characters are extremely well  rendered. The story is superb even if it is a touch too long. Hilary  Swank's young man trapped in a girl's body is extraordinary. Her  performance reminds me very much of the young and innocent Judy Garland of  the late 30s and early 40s. The actress doesn't look that male. Her  innocence is thus key to putting over this extremely complex character.  Miss Swank does it smashingly. I will be very disappointed if she does not  become as big a star as Garland became.",959644800,10,3041,4.806576402321083

Swank and Sevingy put their hearts and  souls into their characters, and it shows.  After seeing the movie, I  listened to the cd.  And even now, having listened to it about a BILLION  times, I still cry every time I hear ""The Bluest Eyes in Texas"".

From Lincoln to  Falls City, seventy miles seperated the past from the future: from Teena  Brandon -- a woman -- to Brandon Teena -- a man.
Hilary Swank portrayed a  woman who suffered, technically, from a ""sexual identity crisis,""  but it seemed to be more like a man who doesn't know why he was born with  some defects. The duality of Brandon is obvious. And, it is the central  focus of the excellent film, ""Boys Don't Cry."" But the subtle  scenes in-between defined what kind of human being Brandon really was: hurt  at being called a lesbian, annoyed with menstration, and finding happiness  at being one of the guys.
This is an emotionally difficult movie to  watch; some of the scenes are graphic and overt, while others are subtle  and tragic. But there are times when love is represented so well, that it  makes one realize how much innocence has been lost in the world; how it is  to be with your first, not thinking about anything else, and looking up at  the stars on the clearest of country nights.",959385600,13,1217,4.733333333333333

Even though the audience knows the tragic ending you somehow hope that Brandon/Swank will find some escape from his/her plight. The Oscar was  well deserved- looking at the list of other nominees this year there was no  one at the same level as Swank. The film's theme of finding and being  comfortable with your true identity is a challenge to anyone watching it.  Thought provoking in the best sense. It also plainly displays the ignorance  and hate you'll find in your own neighborhood if you look for it. One  interesting point I found. When I went to a large video store to rent the  film there were only four copies of it - maybe a reflection of the local  audience's discomfort with the subject.

1074382,4,6305800073,"I don't really believe in acting awards. Is Hilary Swank really in competition with, say, Annette Bening?  I doubt they'd be going up for the same roles, ever.  But the Academy Awards do at least help ensure that  quality films get made and distributed.  And in the case of ""Best  Actress"" awards, they often provide some recognition for smaller  independent films, ones that are often woman centered.  Hilary Swank and  Chloe Sevigny are nothing short of astonishing in this profoundly  disturbing film.  They deserve the accolades--and the nominations and  awards--they've received.  Of course, in a just world, there would also be  recognition for the rest of the cast and certainly for director, Kimberly  Peirce.
Transgenderism, to use the current vernacular, is not a topic  that Hollywood would normally dare touch in any serious way. It took an  independent director like Peice to see that Brandon Teena's story would be  told in a compassionate, largely unsentimental way. She creates a bleak  vision of the rural Midwest as the proverbial ""cultural  wasteland,"" but its residents are granted their humanity and their  dignity.
Let's hope that Swank doesn't suffer from Oscar backlash and  that she continues to find challenging roles that display her range. From  what I've seen of Sevigny's work, she has already established herself as  versatile, important young actress.

Swank was excellent, the boys were too, the pimply one was too  convincing. It is quite fun in many instances, but its the fun scenes that  you watch with a very solemn face, eyes wide and prepared for something, a  fall off the truck, the cracking of the facade.

The most  amazing thing about this movie is the heart-wrenching and tragic story of  Brandon Teena, a confused and troubled soul driven by his dreams to become  the person he thinks he is. As we are drawn into this complex story, we  discover there is a price to pay for realization of our dreams, and sadly,  for Brandon, it was his life. But the true message of ""Boys Don't  Cry"" lies embedded in the context of the film; no matter how confusing  it can be, we all need to live our lives as we see it. Don't miss this  important film, and for further information, I highly suggest ""The  Brandon Teena Story"", also on DVD, as a more factual recount of the  events.

Just knowing that someone had lived this life, and had to be subjected to the torture and humiliation is so sad and disturbing.  There are some scenes that are very disturbing, and I started to feel as  though Hilary Swank was really Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon.  She really got  into her role, and did an outstanding job!  She was the best actress of the  year in my book , as well as OSCARS.  The other actors were also very  good. Chloe Sevigny is one of the great up and coming female actresses out  there. I think you have to be in the right mood to sit down and watch this  movie.  Or make sure you rent something funny/cute to watch after it to  help get your mind off the subject matter. It's a very sad display of how  ignorant people can be. Although i did find this movie quite fascinating,  there were a couple of holes to it. 1.  It's never really explained why  Teena wants to be a man in the first place.  I guess you have to know the  whole true story, and have watched the documentary on the real Teena  Brandon.  2.  How could these people not have known it was really a woman  and not a man?  This really bothered me, Hilary Swank was very convincing  but those so called friends must have been high every time they saw her to  not know that it was really a girl.

I mean this as the ultimate compliment.  Not only Sevigny and Swank, but  everyone in this film is ultimately believable.  This story of a young  woman trying to be a man tears at the heart.  This is not because we all  identify with someone wanting to change their gender, but because we  identify with her struggle to be accepted.  We all wear masks.  Is anyone  totally truthful to their friends or for that matter even theirself.  We  fell for Swanks character because we see her naivety.  She thinks that  everything will be alright, and that she can forever live in her deception.  The more she does manage to fit in the more we cringe because the  reckoning will be that much more destructive.  I realize that this is based  on a true story, but I did have the thought that if the situation had been  reverse and a man had been impersonating a woman the film would have been  even more courageous.  I do not consider this much of a fault however.  The  only fault that I could see were the several scenes where time elapsed  photography was used (the night sky and the factory).  The shots in and of  themselves were great, but they did not blend well with the realism set up  by the location and acting.  Why distract from what is so hard to create in  the first place?

1074468,5,6305800073,"This is a poignant and powerful film.  It is the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who is in the throes of a sexual identity crisis.  She cuts her hair and dresses like a man to see if she can pass for one.  What starts out as an experiment turns into a full fledged alter ego as she  is accepted as a man by a group she meets in a bar.  The story follows the  group's escapades, including Brandon's love affair with Lana, who falls in  love with Brandon, thinking she's a man.  It culminates with the discovery  that Brandon is actually a woman with a dramatic confrontation in the  finale.
This is film noir at it's finest.  A lot of people think that  this is a story about courage and lesbianism but it is really about  neither.  It is about the search for identity; not just sexual identity but  the search for a deeper self .  All the characters in this film were lost  and confused, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself.  The  rest were basically playing out their despondent lives trying not to think  of who or what they were.  Here was a person they loved and accepted, but  who turned out to be the most heinous of deviants as defined by their own  prejudices and fears. This is why they were so fundamentally shaken upon  the revelation of Brandon's true identity.  It left them to confront their  own flimsy identities.  They were left with no respite from the emotional  vortex. Brandon presented a terrifying threat to the way they viewed  themselves.  They were compelled to change who they were or hate someone  they had grown to love.
This film was also about obsession.  Brandon  takes extraordinary risks to live the male role, not out of courage, but  out of an obsession to know and understand it, and to see if she can find  comfort and a sense of belonging.  Likewise, writer/director Kimberly  Peirce had been obsessed with this story and researched it for five years  before finally making the film.  Obsession generally leads to one of two  places: greatness or death.  For Peirce, at least for the moment, it has  lead to greatness in the production of this film.
Strictly from a  technical directorial standpoint there was nothing special here.  The  lighting was amateurish, the shots were mostly mundane. The sets and  locations were realistically trashy, but it is a lot easier to create  realistic trash than realistic elegance.  Peirce also bogs the film down  occasionally with excessive character development.  However, Peirce  captures in the story and the filming, the essence of rural lower class  crudenes, bigotry and hatred and fear.  It is the raw emotion that reaches  out and grabs us.  Her lens brought into sharp focus the base reality of  inescapable despair and deluded hope.  Reality often has fangs, and Peirce  was undaunted in showing them and then ripping us to shreds.
As to Hilary  Swank, I can only add one more rose to the bouquet of praise that has been  heaped on her.  If there was any courage in this story, it was the courage  of Swank to take such a complex and disturbing role.  The subtlety of her  performance was astounding.  She needed not just to be a woman playing a  man.  She needed to be a woman playing a woman playing a man, trying to  look convincing yet insecure and unsure of how she was being perceived by  the other characters.  When in character, her many skillful lapses into  moments of femininity, only to snap back into masculinity were masterfully  done.  For Swank, this was a meteoric rise from obscurity.  It remains to  be seen if it was just the perfect alignment of actor and role, or  something more.  I hope for the latter and look forward to seeing her next  project.
Greatly obscured by Swankmania, was the performance by Chloe  Sevigny as Lana, Brandon's love interest.  She gave an outstanding  performance in another extraordinarily difficult role.  Her conflict over  the implications of her sexual and emotional feelings for Brandon were  sensitively and delicately portrayed.  She played the part with a tentative  eagerness, just as one would expect of someone whose sexual identity had  been thrown into upheaval.  It was also no easy career choice to be cast in  a role with so many explicit sexual scenes with another woman.
This film  was stark reality with no holds barred.  The filmmaking was technically  unsophisticated (and I'm usually a real stickler about that), but I rated  it a 9/10 on pure emotional power.  This film is not for you if you are  offended by lesbianism, graphic violence or profanity.

In 1993, Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) a young man born into a  female's body, befriended a group of teenage yokels, fell in love, and was  then raped and murdered when two men in that group discovered her  biological gender. It's to writer-director Kimberly Peirce's credit that  Brandon isn't portrayed as a martyr, but she isn't developed into much of a  person either. Beyond the fearful dishonesty resulting from her  ""sexual identity crisis,"" Peirce fails to define the character on  any other level. All of the actors do brilliant jobs with the little  they're given, but only Brandon's affection-starved girlfriend Lana (Chloe  Sevigny) is developed into anything more than an unsympathetic plot device.  Had the movie concentrated more on her, and the hope of escape which she  and Brandon see in their love, Peirce would have had an interesting thesis  and perhaps not taken such a sensationalist approach to this material.

Its  the story of a transgender drifter searching for love and friendships with  all the wrong people and who pays the ultimate price in the end by losing  her life to a couple of homophobic small town young men.
A disturbing  movie, I couldn't help but cry in the end.  Its power comes in the simple  storytelling which never condemns Brandon's lifestyle but shows it as it  truly was, a chaotic world which was overshadowed by her fear of discovery.  You knew it was going to happen but the scene where the rednecks rip off  her pants and force Lana to face the truth was disturbing.  What comes  after is the worst degradation inflicted on a human being, the rape and I  couldn't help but cry during this scene.
All in all, it was a superb film  and a scary look at homophobia which is still quite alive in our country.  Brandon's life will forever live on in this film.",956620800,7,1158,4.433333333333334
1074566,5,6305800073,"Boys Don't Cry garnered excellent reviews across the board, so it was with incredibly high expectations that I walked into the theatre.  As it turns out, I think I held this film to much higher standards than usual and found  some problematic areas.
That said, I still find Boys Don't Cry to be a  powerful, touching, and harrowing story of misunderstanding, ignorance, and  love, with one of the most powerfully Quixotic characters to have graced  the screen in ages.  Hilary Swank and director Kimberly Peirce chose the  right approach by exploring thoroughly the joy Brandon experiences at  his/her own transformation, making the tragedy at the end a moving  experience.  Dramatically the film sometimes gets too heavy-handed and it  is the light-fingered moments (Chloe Sevigny's Lana lying in bed with  girlfriends thinking back to her first seduction by Brandon; Lana and  Brandon sharing the excitement of moving away; Brandon watching Lana sing  karaoke) that really shine.
The film does show off technically, with a  flashy editing style, unsubtle use of music and, again, moments that are  almost delirious in their heavy-handed presentation of events and  characters.  However, Boys Don't Cry still manages to stand on its own  thanks to the utter sincerity of the performances, total sympathy with its  characters, and thematic depth.",956620800,7,1346,5.259433962264151

Mix thoroughly and add a tragic end and  you have a favorite of movie critics everywhere.  Unfortunately, you also  have a long, boring movie that will thrill film school students and  deep-thinkers, but will leave those who watch movies for entertainment with  nothing more than two wasted hours.
This film is not all bad.  The  performances by the cast are excellent.  Hilary Swank does a fantastic job  as Brandon Teena, and clearly deserved the Oscar.  The supporting cast also  does admirable work.  But, that work is portraying characters that viewers  cannot connect or relate to in any way.  The story of Brandon Teena is  worth telling, but it is best told by a documentary, not by a movie meant  to entertain.
If you like movies with a serious, important message and  very little entertainment value, see this movie.  If you watch movies for  entertainment, avoid this movie at all costs.  Despite the fine  performances, when I finished this DVD, I wanted my two hours back.  It is  a depressing, long, boring movie that only a critic could love.",956534400,14,1234,4.955665024630542

When she is uncovered as a girl, her white trash friends decide to teach her a little lesson. I watched this film and at the end I was bawling my eyes out. The film was so sad, touching and poignat, that I couldn't stand it. I don't know why it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture because it could have won. Hilary Swank one Best Actress and she DEFINITLY deserved it. She was so excellent that I thought she deserved the Oscar from the first 5 minutes. Chloe Sevigny plays Lana, the woman who Brandon befriends and falls in love with. Sevigny was excellent in her role as second heroine. The acting in the film is nothing short of spectacular.  This film touched me so much! I'm not afraid to admit that I DID cry. I couldn't believe that such a wonderful film could be made.

The  white-trash, hopeless characters that populate this story are without  exception reprehensible, and as the story moves towards it ultra-violent  conclusion, it becomes clear that even Brandon Teena, for all of his/her  conflict and struggle, is more than an active participant in his doom.  This movie exceptionally well-played, and directed and written without a  specific viewpoint; the filmmaker wisely allows the characters, their  actions and the pitch-perfect atmosphere and set decoration evoke a  soulless pocket of people without a conscience.  Boys Don't Cry is an  eye-opening experience in surprising ways, and despite Hilary Swank's  marvel of a performance, it is not Brandon's sad identity crisis that will  haunt you long after watching his story, it is the fact that the people in  this movie really live out there, and in large numbers.

1074643,2,6305800073,"Watching this movie in the theater, I thought from the very beginning that it felt like a TV movie.  It was far too much of a cry out for the world to become comfortable with unconventional sexual politics to be called art.  The director Kimberly Pierce should just become a politician rather than be  a filmmaker if all her stories are going to be thinly disguised  university-campus speeches.  Plus, what's up with the movie's structure?  Instead of letting us know all about Teena's problems within the first act  we are kept in the dark about her whole background throughout the entire  movie's course, learning bits and pieces even far into the film.  Because  of this, we never really know why she makes the choices she does or why she  acts the way she does--we really have no clue who this person is.  And if  the director wants us to like Teena Brandon, well, she screwed up big time  on that.  From the beginning Teena is clueless, overly irresponsible, and  doesn't seem to care about the heterosexual girls' views on finding  out that they've been making out with a chick.  She just laughs it off and  keeps getting into trouble until she gets herself killed.  Real tragic.  And one more thing:  the director doesn't seem to have a clue how dumb  Teena's behavior is.  Pierce stages Teena's exploits as if they are just  those of a regular teenager partying and enjoying life, complete with a  rock soundtrack.  The movie feels like it's ""too cool"" at times  to get really deep.",956102400,12,1490,4.648648648648648
1074644,5,6305800073,"Not only were all the performances in Boys Don't Cry fantastic, so was the directing by Kimberely Pierce.  She directed the film in a modern light, giving Boys Don't Cry and almost ""underground"" aestectic quality.  She used dark midwestern landscapes and splashed them with strikingly  bright colours of a city's neon lights.  Nebraska never looked so  alternative.
Oscar winner Hillary Swank and nominee Chloe Sevigny both  give standout performances, humanizing their characters making us believe  we are watching a real life situation unfolding.  The girl from the tv show  ""Roseanne"" also gives a great performance, along with the actress  who played the mother.  The 2 guys in the film who played the white trash  thugs give me the creeps.  That's how good this movie is, it honestly makes  you love and hate the characters with passionate intensity.
As for the  reviewer who only saw the film as ""teena brandon hanging out in bars  looking for lesbian sex"", well you obviously missed the point of the  movie.  It's not a trivial ""feel-good date movie"".  It has a  deeper, more important theme.  Boys Dont Cry is a story about a lost soul  searching for his/her identity.  While her search is battling against a  world with little campassion or understanding of her needs and feelings as  a human being.  The strident voice of middle American intolerance is  Brandon's ill fated downfall in life.  He only wanted love, because  everybody needs love.",956102400,85,1454,4.991596638655462
1074645,5,6305800073,"Having just seen the film, I have to say ""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Swank's performance could have gone horribly wrong, and yet she kept the tour de force up for the entire  two hours of this mesmerizing film. What I liked about it was:
1. The  direction: Remember, this is a first film. Kimberly Pierce had worked five  years to bring her script to the screen, and does so in a refreshing,  UNPRETENTIOUS way I really related to. Like ""In Cold Blood"" and  ""Badlands"" she focused on the life of these midwestern characters  in such a genuine way that I wouldn't be surprised how people might not be  blown away by it. In fact, it is a SUBTLE approach that I find more  effective in films, I'm all for special effects as in ""The  Matrix"" and the aesthetic elements of say, ""American  Beauty,"" but Pierce's ear for dialogue and her vision of Falls City as  this vast wasteland where young people don't have much of a future and are  filled up with frustrations was inspiring. She told a HUMAN INTEREST STORY  against BIGOTRY in such a DECENT way that even the VILLAINS came out as  being all too human. The narrative structure, while not flashy, was quite  complex and hard to get away with. There was a flow to the film that gave  it the heart that was needed to accurately represent the characters. It's a  SHAME that Pierce fell to the wayside in the awards season--simplicity  seems to be overlooked because most people don't realize that attaining  such an ability is the hardest thing in the world.
2. The acting: Hilary  WAS a boy. Her movements, her countenace, everything. Our complicity with  her character made me realize just how strong a performance she gave. Every  second, in her face, I could see the fear of being found out. All the  complexities of Brandon Teena came alive with a movement of the lips or  with a certain look. The need to please everyone while at the same time  compensating her mere existence with lies and deceit. It is a very  demanding role that she pulled off magnificently. And more importantly, it  is a new kind of role. I've seen the controlling/hysterical woman Annette  Bening played (Faye Dunaway in ""Network"" to name one). But in the  type of role Swank had to play she had little to work with (Jaye Davidson's  Dil in ""The Crying Game"" comes to mind) and yet she avoided  becoming a pitiful figure, and managed to give Brandon an inner beauty that  wasn't preachy or contrived.  CHLOE SEVIGNY was incredible. As a matter of  fact, she impressed me even more than Swank. It is a subtle, powerful  performance that also rises above any other ""girlfriend"" type  role I have ever seen. She endowes Lana with the ability to really love and  care for Brandon and is truly the ray of hope in an otherwise dark movie.  PETER SASGAARD is also a stand out as John Lotter, because he was so human.  An insecure, childish, violent man who is also capable of showing a lot of  affection for his daughter. The undercurrents of BRENDAN SAXTON III's  performance are also worth mentioning simply because  it shows without a  lot of words the confusion he must have felt when he found himself  attracted to this ""guy.""  There are so many layers to this film  that I could go on and on praising it. Of course I have one problem with  it:
1. THE FACTS: Like ""The Insider,"" ""The  Hurricane,"" and a million other films, BDC plays with the facts.  Another person was murdered in that house, an African American male. I feel  that for the film's sake, it was VITAL to focus on the Lana/Brandon  relationship, but being familiar with the case, I thought they could have  handled the misrepresentation of the third victim better.
In short, it  was an amazing movie. Best one I've seen since ""Election."" But  unlike ""Election,"" it doesn't deal with already explored themes.  This is unexplored territory Ms. Pierce was going into, and she came  out--as far as I'm concerned--as an extremely promising filmmaker who will  hopefully continue to tell socially relevant stories in this f&#*ed up  world in which baseball fans give a standing ovation to a bigott and even  wear t-shirts that say ""JOHN ROCKER FOR PRESIDENT""",956102400,32,4178,4.620736698499318

But it's as distant as the full moon above  them, floating so beautifully in and out of view.
The underriding sadness  of the situation is so unbearable as it is portrayed, however, that I  almost couldn't finish watching the movie.
It isn't the transgender  aspect that is so sad...nor is it the harshness of the surroundings, where  these people are trying (or not) to survive and make lives for themselves  in an intellectal and physical wasteland that is so obvious that that alone  is difficult watch...rather, it is the incredible brutality, as portrayed  by the secondary characters so sharply and offhandedly, as this true story  unfolds.

His search to be accepted and love gets him into a  lot of trouble because he is a she.  To Teena that never seems to be an  issue, she knows that deep down inside she is a guy longing for that right  girl.  Her search gets her in trouble and forces her to leave to another  town.  She meets the perfect girl Lana (Chole Sevigny) and her group of  friends.  She feels accepted and just one of the guys.  She gets into bar  room brawls and drinks and smokes with the guys.  Her relationship with  Lana blossoms and everything seems to be going great, until her little  secret is revealed.  She pays the price of her deception with her life.  ""Boys Don't Cry"" is based on the true events of Teena Brandon's life in  rural Nebraska.  Directed by newcomer Kimberly Peirce, it is one of the  best movies of last year.  Hilary Swank gives the performance of a lifetime  as Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena.  Swank won the Oscar for her performance in  this film.  Swank has a certain charm and charisma that enables the viewer  to love her character and not judge her actions.  It doesn't seem out of  the ordinary or weird that she wants to be a guy.  She is a guy, her  mannerisms and looks gives the viewer the sense that she was meant to be a  guy.  That somehow god made a mistake and that Teena is just correcting  it.  The viewer gets pulled into her charm.  You want her to get the girl  and be happy.  You feel her desire for love and want and cheer for her to  get it.  Swank's performance gets the viewers to fall for Teena and see who  he really is on the inside and not what he is on the outside.  The  supporting cast is also another strong point of this film.  Sevigny gives a  strong performance as Lana, a troubled buy loving girl who falls for Teena.  Sevigny got an Oscar nomination for her performance in this film.  Lana  loves Teena for what he is, a charming, caring and sensitive person.  Even  when she is confronted with the truth, she looks away.  His word is all she  needs and even after the truth comes out she still loves him.  She still  goes to him and realizes that her love for him is more important than his  gender.  She sees the love in him and loves it back with no reservations in  her mind. Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III also give strong  performances as John and Tom.  They befriend Teena after a bar fight and  introduce him to Lana.  They are a rough group with a criminal past, but at  first they seem like good people.  But they have a wild temper and when  they find out the truth, the consequences become deadly.  The film has a  slow pace, but with good cause.  It stays close to the actual events of the  story and treats the story delicately.

1074743,4,6305800073,"The brutal rape and murder of trans youth Brandon Teena shockedmany in the small Nebraska town of Humboldt where the events occurredfive years ago. But it came as no shock to the many thousands of trans people who live under the threat of violence every day. Since December 1994 when Brandon Teena--and his friends Lisa Lambert and Phillip DeVine--were all murdered by John Lotter and Tom Nissen, various artistic attempts have tried to put the events in perspective. Two plays and two films have so far chronicled the short life and violent death of working-class youth Brandon Teena.  The latest attempt is the film ""Boys Don't Cry,"" directed by Kimberly Pierce. The film is a fictionalized account of Brandon's last few months on earth. The writers and director have taken some liberties with the facts of the case. In fact, one of the women whom Brandon Teena reportedly dated in real life has asked that her name be removed from this film. The ethical issues facing a filmmaker fictionalizing a story about real people--some of them still living--make this film a target of justifiable criticism. But the film also makes an important contribution. It reveals with an unflinching gaze to a mass audience the violence wielded by bigots against someone seen as ""other."" For transgender and transsexual people--and many others whose lives have been wounded as targets of such frenzied reactionary violence--the graphic portrayal of brutality may be extremely painful and difficult to watch.  The film begins in Lincoln, Neb., where Brandon Teena--whom this reviewer felt was played quite convincingly by Hilary Swank--runs from bigots who have discovered the ""secret"" of his birth sex.  Teena moves to Falls City, where he is initially accepted by a group of friends. There he begins a love relationship with a woman named Lana--played with warmth by Chlo Sevigny. But his life begins to unravel when Falls City Sheriff Charles Laux arrests Teena and publicly exposes the fact that he was born female-bodied. This exposure leads two of his former ""buddies"" to gang-rape Brandon Teena. And the forcible outing by the police eventually leads to his later murder at the home of Lisa Lambert. Lambert's friend in real life--Phillip DeVine--was also murdered at the house. But this was not depicted in the film. This omission unfortunately means that viewers don't know the part that racism played in this murderous attack. DeVine was an African American man who was visiting the virtually all-white town at the time of the attack. There are large issues that are not covered in this film. Brandon Teena's identity and murder are taken out of social context. Trans oppression as a whole is not explored, for example. Neither is the question of working-class oppression. In the beginning of the film Lotter and Nissen have recently been released from jail. The entire area is extremely economically depressed. There appear to be very few jobs for anyone--especially former prisoners--and poverty is commonplace. Drugs and alcohol that numb the mind and senses are used heavily by all characters throughout the film.  Lotter and Nissen are the kind of white straight men so marginalized in the working class that they can be seduced by right-wing ideology into blaming trans people and women for their problems. Ultimately Brandon Teena was killed for attempting to be himself in a world that has little tolerance for sex and gender variations. This intolerance isn't simply a symptom of living in a small town in Nebraska. A mountain of historical evidence reveals that transsexual and transgender and intersexual people lived in small cooperative communities for thousands of years before the division of society into haves and have-nots. And they enjoyed the respect of their communities. But these were societies based on sharing the fruits of communal labor in which each member's contributions were vital and therefore appreciated Brandon Teena is a victim of quite a different historical period. Under capitalism, a tiny handful of families claim to own the vast system of production that has been built through the collective labor of the working class. Ideology that whips up bigotry plays an important role in such an unjust and unequal economy. It disarms and weakens the potential unity of the giant laboring class. Had there been no 1969 Stonewall uprising--which subsequently unleashed the massive modern movement for lesbian, gay, bi and trans liberation--Brandon Teena's death might have passed unnoticed and this film would never have been made. And the progressive struggle to shed light on his murder is a part of the growing movement for trans liberation--a social movement that may end up shaking the current notions about sex and gender to their very foundations. But it will take a truly massive and united struggle against all forms of bigotry to put a stop once and for all to the kind of violence that claimed Brandon Teena's life--and the lives of so many other trans people.",954374400,42,4996,5.1113831089351285

I watched it again the other night and its just as brutal and shocking as I remembered. Teenas story changed our world. Its a important one to remember. Swank played a awesome role.",1525478400,,289,4.2727272727272725

7894649,5,6305800073,"Geesh!  This was a rough  movie.  1/2 way thru, I had to turn off the video and take mini-breaks.
Hilary Swank was awarded an Oscar for her performance, for obvious reasons.
To play this part in 1999, was pretty radical, IMHO.
This is not a movie you want to watch on a dark rainy day.
Frankly, it's depressing.
The film was a little too ""raw"" for me.
Extremely realistic.",1523750400,,372,4.36231884057971
