8148018,4,B000IZJQV6,"It's a 2001 Hindi movie and was written and directed by Goldie Behl. The film stars Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Sushmita Sen and Jackie Shroff. It was a Disaster at the box-office, but I still thought it was way better than many of even their own Blockbuster films that year.

The story goes: Suraj (Abhishek Bachchan), a simple village man who, comes to Mumbai from Benaras to earn a degree in college. He gets smitten by a light-eyed beauty Pooja (Rani Mukerji). After some dilly-dallying the duo express their love for each other.

Suraj has big dreams. He wants to emulate his mentor Naved Ali (Jackie Shroff) a shrewd media baron. Then, one day, in a heroic deed in which Suraj saves the life of a fatally wounded man, Suraj impresses Naved Ali. A flattered Naved sends his raunchy colleague Lara (Sushmita Sen) to rope in Suraj to start a new channel.

Slowly the callow youth becomes a clever businessman and Lara begins to take Poojas place. Pooja tries to convince Suraj of the futility of it all but only in vain. Suraj is determined to carve a place for himself in the higher echelons of the society. Soon he has everything he ever wanted and dreamed of  a swanky bungalow, sleek cars etc. But he has lost his innocence.

And one day Suraj realizes the dastardly motives of Naved Ali (who wants to become the PM of the country) and how he has been used as a pawn in his power game.",1468108800,,1397,4.5059288537549405

8148020,4,B000IZJQV6,"This movie, Bas Itnasa Kwab Hai, is an excellent addition to those who love foreign movies, especially Bollywood films and Rani at her best. The plot is fabulous and keeps you enthralled from beginning to end. Abhishek and Rani help each other to shine in this film, which reminds me so much of the ""Devil's Advocate"", a fine American film starring Keanu Reeves.",1237939200,3,362,4.761904761904762
8148021,1,B000IZJQV6,"Do not spend money on buying this DVD.

Do not spend time watching this movie.

I actually PURCHASED it from Amazon and sincerely regret such a thoughtless action on my part.  Abhishek Bachchan's movies tend to be good, but this was TERRIBLE.

Bad acting, bad story, bad music, bad clothing, just bad, bad, bad.

No redeeming value whatsoever.

Save yourself.",1233014400,,359,4.9
