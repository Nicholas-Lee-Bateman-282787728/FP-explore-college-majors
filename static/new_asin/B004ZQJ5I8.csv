4510615,4,B004ZQJ5I8,"This is a very low budget zombie film which features adult film star Alexis Texas in a slightly less than adult role. A bio-hazard lab has an oops which leads to infected zombies etc. All the action takes place within the building and we get to see much of the same rooms over and over again. The film is horribly acted with camp dialouge. Newcomer Lauren Todd was my favorite of the bad actors spouting out MF bombs with a librarian face. The blood was abundant and squirting. The gun fire was poor CG.

The respirators they use make it difficult for normal voice communication so they dubbed themselves.

4510618,2,B004ZQJ5I8,"Bloodlust Zombies (Dan Lantz, 2011)

I watched five movies yesterday. (Actually, five and a half, since I finished one I had started previously as well.) And I am willing to say right up front that the reason Bloodlust Zombies was, by a nose, my favorite of the bunch has to do with the exact combination of the movies I watched--because I am willing to grant this movie's vociferous, and scathing, critics pretty much every bad thing they say about it, but in every case--every single one--I watch a much more widely-praised movie that did it worse than this one did. So, yeah, in the canon of bad--and this is a movie I decided to watch because (thanks to the wonderful Google Chrome Netflix Queue Sorter plug-in, which is in and of itself worth switching to Chrome for your primary browser if you're a Netflix user) I sorted my queue on star + average rating and then chose something in the bottom five, which I do on occasion just for grins--this was listed as the third-lowest film in my queue. (I didn't have the stomach for The Dead Undead, which is #1, and I'm saving #2, Bloodlust!, for watching with my infant son, who seems to be more attracted to black and white movies than color when he's up all night.) And every one of those other movies that did something worse? They were higher up--in come cases, a lot higher up.

Plot: a high-security chemical research facility has just developed a hot new drug with military applications. There's a spill, of course, and the facility is locked down, trapping a handful of employees inside. This chemical, naturally, transforms those it comes into contact with into ravening, blood-hungry zombie-like creatures (this is a rage movie, not a zombie movie, but, you know, six of one...), setting up the usual survive-the-night scenario.

Yes, I will give you pretty much everything bad you say about this movie. Its script? Terrible--but Red State`s is far, far worse (and I was much more okay with the talky portions here, which at least featured snappy characters--like everyone else I will single out Lauren Todd as the movie's best character AND best actor). The acting is crap? True--but everyone in this movie gives an Oscar-worthy performance compared to those I was exposed to in Ao Bisiesto, which also covers the ""the lighting is terrible"", and ""the sound design is terrible"". Soundtrack woes? Man, you've gotta watch Baby Shower. I grant you, the soundtrack problems are only in one scene, but when you get there, you will laugh your cojones off. Trust me on this.

And, when it comes right down to it, let's face it--you're not watching a horror movie starring porn chanteuse Alexis Texas because you're actually expecting a quality horror film. And from that perspective, well, this movie is so chock-full of hotties that you'll think you're in a strip club. (And if you had any preconceptions about this movie being serious horror, and they don't go away in the scene where Darren [The Happening's Adam Danoff] is confronted by, in his words, ""okay... random naked chick walking towards me..."", then you, sir, are most definitely in the wrong place.) When the porn star who gets top billing is only the third-hottest woman in the movie, you have to at least give mad props to the casting director. Am I wrong?

Go into it expecting stupid fun, and that is exactly what you will find. **",1354233600,,3352,4.7624784853700515
4510619,3,B004ZQJ5I8,"So going into this film that was written and directed by Dan Lantz I noticed it was one of the first full length films he had done and first stabs at horror. That always means it's going to be hit or miss and when you mix in the fact that it's one of the debut films of Alexis Texas not making a porno flick that ends up being a zombie film.... all I could really think of was Zombie Strippers and how horrible the movie was when Jenna Jameson decided to do the same thing.

So how did the film stack up?

Well it was more enjoyable to watch than Zombie Strippers (which isn't saying much) but before you get your hopes up let me bring you back to reality and state that this is clearly a B movie plot with a slightly higher budget. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible and for those who are hoping for the nearly obligatory nude/sex scenes they clearly make sure to make use of Alexis's assets to pull them off in style.

Moving onto our B plot - Zlantoff Industries, a biological warfare warfare company, has developed the latest and greatest way to kill the enemies of whoever decides to buy from it. It looks like they are infecting felines with a new drug that turns them into a murderous rage that cannot be controlled. Clearly it's the perfect way to disrupt an enemy as the idea is to infect an enemy army with it and watch the soldiers tear each other apart.

Insert some B movie fantasies as the president of the company accidentally has the PA system on as he has his way with his secretary (Alexis) and in doing so distracts the research team that has perfected the virus. So surprisingly we are actually given a reason for a zombie outbreak to occur though I found it a bit hard to stomach the thought of how bad security precautions were in a biological warfare test lab. I think their premise for an outbreak was sound but they should have gone a bit further on making it look like there was actually precautions in place that the accident caused to screw up. Yes, I know - B movie. The problem is the production wasn't really low end B movie material so I felt with the plot being mediocre it really took away from what could have been a fun romp (and I'm not meaning with the porn star turned zombie killing heroine by the end of the film.) Part of that romp probably did come from all of the female zombies trying to seduce the men that they ended up turning or eating. Yes apparently female zombies have a high sex drive and for the ones without easily visible wounds, it really worked well for them.

While thee special effects weren't top notch and the zombies weren't the 'best' in the world they weren't bad and there wasn't going to be a lot of corpse rotting with how fresh they were. The wounds looked decent as did the gore factor and to be honest most of that just worked. I wouldn't get too attached to the characters because of a mixture of a high body count and a lack of depth to personalities but still the high body count keeps the deaths coming throughout the entire film.",1349049600,,3009,4.299823633156967
4510620,1,B004ZQJ5I8,"Wow horrible film with porn star acting and sets, I guess someone in the industry thought they might break into the mainstream. This is a waste if you want to watch T&A watch porn star Alexis Texas in one of her movies. This isn't funny nor is it even remotely scary.",1334016000,,267,4.254901960784314
4510621,3,B004ZQJ5I8,"As far as dumb horror- comedy zombie movies starring an adult porn star go, Bloodlust Zombies is actually a pretty good little film.  Alexis Texas will never get the role of Hester Prynne in a modern remake of The Scarlet Letter, but she can more than hold her own against her fellow cast members in a B--movie romp like Bloodlust Zombies.  She's really not that bad of an actress, truth be told, and she's certainly easy on the eyes, even when covered in blood.  I do feel compelled to point out, however, that there really aren't any zombies in this movie.  People start acting like zombies after being exposed to a new bloodlust-inspiring biological weapon and they need to be shot in the head like zombies - but they are not zombies, technically-speaking.  Now some people are going to pre-deduct points from this film just because it stars an adult film star, and they're probably going to tut and shake their heads when Alexis is called upon to take off her clothes and act all sexy - but I'm not one of those people.  Even if I were, there are a number of other enjoyable aspects to this film.  You've got some office satire, a lot of pretty satisfying gore (particularly in the arterial spray department), and all kinds of juvenile humor that will make you laugh (whether you want to admit it or not).

What looks like a regular office building is in fact a bioweapons facility working on a rage virus sort of pathogen that is designed to make the bad guys go crazy and kill each other.  It's the brainchild of a woman who watched her husband die at the hands of terrorists in Afghanistan.  The company has taken all sorts of precautions to avoid disaster - a security system that locks down the entire building in the case of an emergency, a security force of two low-paid Rent-a-Cops with four whole days of training, and, of course, a secure lab facility.  Unfortunately, no one foresaw the consequences of lab workers reacting rather raucously to the accidental intercom broadcast of the boss getting freaky with his secretary.  Before you can say ""Bruce Campbell,"" it's every man and woman for himself/herself as the infected start attacking their coworkers and spreading the bloodlust all over the building.

There are some pretty funny scenes to be enjoyed between the murderous attacks.  In one, the office pervert is torn between the sight of naked breasts and the knowledge that those breasts are attached to an infected woman trying to kill him.  Then there's the scene where the security guy is called upon by the potty-mouthed intern to defend his decision to stay locked up in the secure command center instead of getting out there and trying to save people's lives.  The whole comedy thing is helped by the fact that the worst actors and actresses are among the first to die.  If you're not the kind of person who might enjoy this type of film, you wouldn't still be reading this - so go ahead and just rent the thing.  You know you want to.",1319414400,10,2964,4.624045801526718

8450356,1,B004ZQJ5I8,"It seems that everytime someone decides to direct their first feature, it turns out to be a horror film. And for the past decade, most freshman directors decide to make those horror films depicting zombies; a good percentage of the films dealing with a bunch of infected people killing the unaffected in a locked-down facility, not for the sake of the story, but to keep costs down (the fewer the locations, the cheaper and faster you can shoot it). That describes BLOODLUST ZOMBIES to a tee, with the only different thing about it being that it stars bubble-butted adult actress Alexis Texas (who has made an amazing 329 adult films between 2007 and 2014 and made her share of TV and Film adult ""parodies"", a term the adult film business uses so the major studios can't sue them for copyright infringement). Let me say this about Alexis Texas: as an actress, she makes a fine naked female. In other words, she has no future in non-porn films unless she starts taking acting lessons (Fred Olen Ray used her once in BIKINI FRANKENSTEIN [2009] and hasn't worked with her since. Now that should tell you something.). The film starts with two lab rats performing experiments on cats with a new serum called ""BZ32"". After giving the cats shots of BZ32, one cat kills another. Their experiment turns into a success, so at a late-night board meeting, president and CEO Bobby Lee (Robert Heath) asks co-workers Judy Miller (Janice Marie), Darren (Adam Danoff, this film's Co-Producer and Editor), Catherine (Catherine White) and Executive Assistant Andrea (Alexis Texas) to stay late so they can Skype the good news to their sister company in another time zone. BZ32 is a hit. Well, it's a hit if you take into consideration that it causes humans to become zombified fighting machines (Bobby Lee plans on using this new serum/virus on enemy soldiers so that they will kill each other [There are so many holes in that logic to drive a train through. The first one being: Who are the zombies going to chow-down on next when they eat all their fellow soldiers? Wouldn't they go after us?]). We then see Andrea and Bobby Lee playing ""hiding the sausage"" (I guess when you can't act, you do what you know best), while Catherine is bringing champagne to the two lab rats for a job well done. One of the workers drops a test tube in the lab, but he says that it wasn't one containing the BZ32 virus, yet the entire building goes into lockdown just in case the threat is real. Catherine is attacked by one of the infected cats and she, in turn, attacks the two lab workers, turning them into the titled creatures. You guessed it: The unaffected employees must now run and hide from the zombies (It is impossible to leave or get into the building [Another huge hole in the plot. Wouldn't some outside agency like the CDC be notified if something like this happened? Or at least the local Police Department?]). The zombies bite everyone they come into contact with (We can imagine the special effects technician, just offscreen, pushing the rubber bulb containing the fake blood and it comes out in perfect streams. It seems every bite results in the same effect.), while everyone else does the most idiotic things at the most inopportune times. This is supposed to be a funny horror film, but their idea of ""funny"" is Darren imagining all the women in various states of undress when they ask him what he is thinking. There is not an original thought in this film's tiny little brain (they rip off ""The Girl From Ipanema"" elevator  scene from DEEP RISING [1998] for criminity's sake!). Darren even takes a camera photo of his penis to prove to ""Libby The Temp"" (Lauren Todd) that he is not a zombie, as they shoot guns at each other from a distance of about ten feet (a joke badly ripped-off from THE NAKED GUN - 1988). Alexis Texas proves to us that her greatest assets are her bubble butt and her breasts, as her acting reeks so bad, you can smell it coming out of your disc player. And why do directors and producers always think that they can act in the films they are making? Director/screenwriter/cinematographer/co-producer Dan Lantz (whose only other directorial effort is the gay-themed thriller INTO THE LION'S DEN - 2011) portrays a security guard that likes talking to himself and keeps a closet full of automatic weapons. I really can't decide which is worse: His direction or acting (In the DVD's blooper reel, Lantz tells us that he isn't even in the film, so either he has a short memory or is just trying to make us forget his bad acting). And co-producer/editor Adam Danoff, who supplies most of the film's ""comedy"", is just simply terrible and unfunny. The basic truth is that while there is plenty of violence, such as ears getting bitten off, skin being bitten and pulled like string cheese, gunshots to the head and axe attacks, Lantz and Danoff's screenplay is juvenile at best and misogynistic at worst (I guess when you have a adult film ""actress"" starring in your film, you must think you can get away with a lot more jokes at the expense of women). There really is not one thing to recommend in this film, not even Alexis Texas' nudity. If you want to see her nude and do much more, rent one of her TV and movie porn parodies. I guarantee you will be a lot more entertained than watching this poor excuse of a film. I have bits of things in my stool that are more entertaining than this.
