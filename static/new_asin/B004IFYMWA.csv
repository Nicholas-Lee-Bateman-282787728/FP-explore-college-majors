8430690,3,B004IFYMWA,"... and that's the case here. The story is told mainly in flashback as The Durango Kid (Charles Starrett) recounts the tale of a stolen stash of gold known only to blind outlaw Bill Donner and a child in which Donner confided, but is desired by outlaw Frank Fenton. The ""ghost town"" was once a thriving place, but Fenton ran everyone out of town by terrorizing the settlers, all so he could have the place to himself and eventually find the gold. There are lots of good action shots in this film mainly because about two thirds of the film is stock footage from past Durango Kid westerns. Only the ending shots and the scenes where Durango is recounting the tale are new footage. There are some macabre elements here you don't normally see in these westerns, such as outlaw Bill Donner locking his partners in the hidden vault with the gold and leaving them, now two of the richest men in the world, to die in a grave of gold. In another scene Donner is captured by Fenton's gang and then returns blinded. It is not clear whether Donner blinded himself so he could not be forced to divulge the location of the loot, or if Fenton did it out of meanness, and in this case, stupidity.

If you haven't seen the past Durango Kid westerns and therefore recognize all of the stock footage, and you like westerns in general, you should like this one.",1372723200,,1342,4.455284552845528
8430691,4,B004IFYMWA,"""Streets of Ghost Town"" is a Durango Kid B-Western made in 1950.

This is another well above average Durango Kid tale and like
""Snake River Desperadoes"", it has been selected by Sony for
digital restoration to pristine condition in both picture and
sound quality. To date, Sony have done a great job in selecting
the best tales for restoration and we hope that they continue
to do so.

The movie tells the story of Steve Woods (Charles Starrett),
Smiley (Smiley Burnette) and the Dusty Creek Sheriff (Stanley
Andrews) who go to a ghost town to search for missing gold.
The story which at times is told in flashback, tells the tale
of how a gang of crooks stole the gold and were later double-
crossed by one of the gang. The only one who knows the
whereabouts of the gold is a young boy named Tommy Donner
(Don ""Brown Jug"" Reynolds) who frequents the ghost town
and he is forced by members of the gang to lead them to the
location of the gold.

An interesting story and better than most. The ghost town
looks authentic and very non-inviting with its isolation,
rolling wind-swept tumbleweeds, old derelict buildings and
creaking doors and shutters.

This disc has other good features such as having only one
movie title on the disc making it a lot more convenient for
selection.

Again it is a welcomed departure from the many years of
routine productions. The numerous harmony songs by various
groups over the years, which were really unnecessary,
have been discontinued and Smiley Burnette supplies mainly
the comedy relief.

Good, above average entertainment.",1350604800,,1562,4.788104089219331
