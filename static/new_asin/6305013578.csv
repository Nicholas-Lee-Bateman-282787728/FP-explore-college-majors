I've seen the old VHS version of this, I've seen the later colorized version with modern music, I saw a restored version shown live at Royce Hall at UCLA with the Berlin Philharmonic playing live the original score for the movie.  But I couldn't get through the first five minutes of this score.  It feels like a bad Atari video game cartridge.

953899,2,6305013578,"This ""Loy Cook Score"" version is probably the worst attempt yet at replacing the (perfectly fine, really) original score of Metropolis with something more ""modern,"" which apparently means hiring some guy with a cheap synthesizer to knock out unlistenable Eurodisco tracks with practically no reference to what's happening on-screen whatsoever. Admittedly, it's not quite as bad as a score from a typical 70's adult movie - but at least the people making 70's adult movie music weren't murdering a classic of silent cinema. Perhaps someday, someone will record a modern score for this movie that's worthy of it, but in the meantime, just stick with the original.",1521244800,5,661,5.186915887850467

953964,5,6305013578,"Many silent films, although quite old, are still very enjoyable. Many critics consider the 1927 German anti-authoritarian expressionistic science fiction drama, directed by Fritz Lang, the best and most innovated film, whose ideas were copied in many subsequent even modern films. The film critic Roger Ebert wrote Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating,
Metropolis is a somewhat eerie, but arresting and thought-provoking film about a future society comprised of two classes, pampered elites living in luxuriate pleasure-filled surroundings, and an overworked workers class submersed in squalor. The country is ruled by a ruthless man devoid of feelings for the multitude of overtired workers, their wives and children.
His son, Freder, sees a beautiful woman, Maria, who brought children of workers from the catacombs where they live to see the elite. Before she and the children can be chased away, Freder is captivated by her beauty. He goes below to see her, is traumatized by the degradation of the workers, and decides to help them.
Maria has not only enchanted Freder, but the entire worker population. She prophesizes that a mediator will soon arise who will bring the classes together.
Meanwhile, Freders father approaches the mad scientist, the genius Rotwang, and orders him to create a robot that looks like Maria. He should use to replace Maria and lead the workers to do what he wants them to do and forget about the coming mediator.
The film is enthralling and can be understood as an allegory. It is filled with biblical images that add depth and meaning. Maria reminds viewers of the biblical prophets when she speaks about the mediator who can be understood as a messiah who will solve problems. She compares the current society to the Tower of Babel where people speak the same language but do not understand each other. The workers world is flooded in the film, as the world was flooded during the time of Noah. The Maria-robot who preaches to the people is reminiscent of the scriptural false prophets, and can be understood as true religion being usurped by evil or misguided people. Freders father kills some bad workers by forcing them into the mouth of a huge face called Moloch, which is mentioned in the Bible as an idol.
The director Fritz Lang was shocked when in 1934 the Nazi Joseph Goebbels called him into his office and told him that Adolf Hitler enjoyed the film so much that he was offered the position as the head of the German film studio UFA and he could be made an honorary Aryan even though his mother was Jewish before she converted to Catholicism. Goebbels said, Herr Lang, we decide who is Jewish and who is not. Lang ran from Germany that very night.",1499212800,5,2709,4.891304347826087

Be prepared to spend some time on this movie, as it is long, and you may want to break it into two sittings, rather than to rush the film ahead.  Unfortunately, you only get to see the 'golden girl', as I call her, in the mid-beginning and at the end, but the rest of the film is worth the wait.  Her name is Hel and, when she becomes real, she can be hell personified.  She is life and death, love and war, the Virgin Mary and Salome'.  The writers and producers thought of everything in this film and, it resonates today as well as it did when produced.  Watch - and enjoy.

Metropolis moves effortlessly across millennia, from whole to detail, from deeply personal to broad human experiences, with compelling scholarly interviews, excellent acting, and backed by remarkable computer animations. The viewer is quickly spellbound through the edifying journeys through these cities; how they emerged, grew, suffered, and flourished, seen from virtually every possible angle.

As a project, Metropolis is an undertaking of utmost complexity, riddled with challenges everywhere. Yet, the German-Canadian team conquered the obstacles to deliver a formidable account on these ancient cities. The mastery of focus and balance is flawless and deeply impressive. The viewer will be greatly enriched and spurred to continue his or her further studies. I warmly recommend you to spend your valuable time with Metropolis.",1467849600,,982,6.014285714285714

954299,4,6305013578,"Reading through some of the older reviews, it seems there have been several really bad versions of the Moroder Metropolis released over the years with various problems such as poor sound syncing, incorrect running time, degraded film quality, etc. Having just watched extended excerpts the Instant Video version here on Amazon I do believe it's very close to what I saw in the theater in the 80s. The scenes all seem to be here and the music is properly synchronized to the images the way I remember (I saw it at the movies several times when it was originally released and it left a lasting impression) and it seems to run at the proper spead.

That said, this version is somewhat darker and grainier that what I saw on the big screen. I'm sure of that because there were details in the sets and painted backdrops that I noticed back then that are no longer visible and facial expressions that were striking at the time are now less so or even in one instance, impossible to see. Finally, the frame is often shaky, which seems unnecessary in this day and age. None of this surprises me as Kino, while among the better companies for silents, can still be hit-or-miss. At least the sound quality is pretty good and that's of course important for the Moroder version.

Overall, I think it's worth the price. It's plenty good enough compared to some of the problems reported with earlier DVD releases. Though of course I wouldn't mind getting my hands on one of those 1980s laser discs people have mentioned that are apparently fully faithful to the original theater release!",1445644800,9,1572,4.671480144404332

Then, a few years ago, the full version was discovered  and now everyone can see what the censors removed, i.e. the sections showing what a sexy, immoral temptress the robot portrayed, thus making it clear that the forces at work were, inter alia, passionate, sexy irreligion vs. virginal selflessness. The movie now has so much more meaning than in the expurgated version. The soundtrack, of course, is gorgeous.  There is, on Youtube, a version of this movie with a replacement soundtrack, some rock 'n roll band's. This is just plain criminal.  Director Fritz Lang  worked with
composer Gottfried Huppertz to create the movie's soundtrack. Put in a substitute track and a significant portion of the immortal, brilliant Director's artistic vision is lost.

954392,5,6305013578,"I hate the fact that Amazon seems to put reviews for different versions of films under all versions of a particular film. In the case of Metropolis, there are at least three versions available as I write this: One of the versions that had been available for a number of years, but incomplete and often of poor quality; the ""Giorgio Moroder"" version; and what's now called ""The Complete Metropolis"". Note: At least nine versions have been out there at one time or another.

If you are a film buff, I probably don't have to suggest a version. But, if you have become interested in exploring older, sometimes silent films, go for ""The Complete Version"". It's about an hour longer than the Moroder version, thanks to found film, stills, script for additional inter-titles, AND it has the great original score(IMHO, Moroder's score wouldn't work with any version). Be aware, though, that some of the found film is of a different size and/or quality, so, if you are like a lot of the ""youngsters"" these days that hate black&white or subtitles or a picture that doesn't fill your TV screen, maybe avoid this.

Metropolis is a great film way ahead of it's time. The Complete Metropolis was released in 2010.",1436918400,,1199,4.759615384615385

954458,5,6305013578,"For just over ten years Thea von Harbou and her then husband Fritz Lang collaborated to produce what would become some of the most iconic movies of silent film history.

Included in this list were Destiny (the story of a very tired Death), Siegfried (from an old German tale), Woman in the Moon and of course this story Metropolis. For each of these stories von Harbou would ply her creative skills to write the story. Lang would apply his considerable cinematic skills to put that story on screen.

Because von Harbou's book version of this story so easily exists we can therefore compare von Harbou's vision with Lang's later finished product. As so often happens even between married collaborators there were some differences like how the book ended versus the movie.

In the case of the book while von Harbou's writing style isn't totally opaque the way some pre modern literature is, this book is still not an easy read. It's filled with many supporting characters whose stories often interfere with the main thread of the narrative. Also because von Harbou wanted to write in conscious imitation of other works like the Bible some of her verbiage and editorial choices can cause even sophisticated readers to take pause, not only to keep track of her story but also to indulge that other pursuit: determining the source for von Harbou's inspiriation for that particular point.

Though the book and movie differ they both tell a similar story.  In the main this is a father son story of sorts. Father runs a futuristic dystopian community. Son, like Siddartha who had been sheltered suddenly finds his eyes open to the inequities around him. As son ventures forth to combat those inequities he finds love and then unsuspected adversity. This later discovery happens when he encounters the work of the man who had vied for his mother's affections. This work is the famous android or robot of Metropolis so unforgettably played by Brigitte Helm. From there on the movie is a mad dash, arguably more a collision of characters than a story proper.

While von Harbou's book is now mostly remembered as a historical footnote, Lang's movie remains a cinematic masterpiece.  Even without a smoothly flowing plot Lang repeatedly showed himself more than able to create scene after iconic scene.",1433635200,2,2290,4.917098445595855

Given the problems of finding a full, useable copy, it's short of a miracle that so much has been assembled. The story and effects must have been groundbreaking in its day and, with the restoration, they can still be relished today as a unique moment of film history. However, in spite of Metropolis' persistent questioning of human relations in an mass production, industrial world, it pulls back at the end by leaving solutions to having good intentions. It vividly shows the inhumanity brought about by the forms of industrialization, yet relies on human compassion to solve its problems. Workers remain slaves to the machine, and the rich/powerful can remain rich/powerful as long as they have compassion.",1433376000,3,805,5.2

954672,5,6305013578,"People throw around the term ""this ________ is the Holy Grail of ________."" And when it comes to film, especially classic films, there are three that top the list of ""Holy Grails"": (1) Greed (1924, Erich Von Stroheim), (2) The Magnificent Ambersons (1942, Orson Welles), and (3) Metropolis (1926, Fritz Lang). But what makes a film reach the status of ""Holy Grail""? Typically, it is three things: (1) a legendary, notorious, and tyrannical director at the helm, (2) a very troubled shoot from start to finish with budgets ballooning and actors and crew often facing bodily harm, and (3) a total hatchet job (i.e. massive editing) from a pissed off film studio, distributors, and producers. Usually in the end, the film is only a shadow of its intended greatness, the director often is fired and exiled, while the actors and crew become world famous and better craftsmen in the process. Roger Ebert once wrote, ""...sometimes a lost film is more lamented than missed."" Lost films are like lost sheep because they sometimes get found. Metropolis (1926, Fritz Lang) is one of those lost and lamented then missed and (miraculously) found films that shapes the standards of contemporary film and sets the bar for artistic excellence very high.  The object of this review is not to give a skinny account of an epic film, as that would be criminally unfair to the potential audience and the ""spirit of the film"", rather the object is to introduce a legendary film that carries with it more baggage than a 747. Be forewarned, you will get frustrated with this film. It doesn't make sense at times; yet with its futuristic atmosphere and trippy storyline you cannot help but keep watching. Treat the screening of this film as a micro-event, for instance (1) definitely watch it at night with the lights few and obligations low, (2) don't Google or research the film ahead of time as it might spoil the initial impact of surprise, and (3) after the film, keep your phone or computer handy because you will have questions. If these steps are taken then the viewer is guaranteed to remember this film.  Remember Metropolis is not on the mainstream radar, most people don't come to Metropolis lightly, and they've developed a curiosity over time. A few final notes: (1) the film is German, but as a silent film it doesn't matter because the title cards are already translated, (2) view the 2011 Kino restored version, and (3) enjoy.",1420848000,4,2418,4.824096385542169
954673,5,6305013578,"This time a German silent film, very convoluted, very difficult to watch. Hard to follow, chopped up over and over by movie director's who had no idea of what they were doing. Long film, requires concentration and a quiet room. I can see some early historical Nazi references in the film, long before Nazi's were invented. It's a tough film, very hard to follow along in many areas. The costumes are great, the actors movements at times can seem comical and silly, but this only due to the age of the film and the (I think) due to the type of film and cameras used at the time?.

There is a lot of insight into Big Business and the workers acting like drones. Fruitlessly manning their positions only to be killed in horrible ways, slaves to uncaring management. This film has many references to our modern world, a young man whose father has built a corporate empire on the backs of his employees, the price of un-measureable success and wealth, a lost, lonely boy, the owner's son, employees who are not recognized for their efforts, long time devoted employees fired for a supposed cause. Employees, who stand by unaffected while their fellow employees are killed. This film requires more than (1) viewing, it also requires patience and a true love of silent films. I have only watched about 1/4 of the movie, it takes a lot to follow along and more to understand the message, but it is well worth watching.
It's a tough film to watch and absorb, but this in no way diminishes the fact that this film is a real masterpiece for its time and an intense undertaking by all the cast, costumers and its original production crew and director.",1420761600,,1639,4.593856655290103

954758,4,6305013578,"It is both ironic and unfortunate that Fritz Lang is best remembered for one of his worst films. When he had finished Metropolis in 1926 he declared himself dis-satisfied with the result as it flopped on initial release and was cut to bits by Paramount for its American distribution. When it was re-released in Germany, the American cut was used until its ban by Josef Goebbels. All old prints were thought to have been returned to Ufa and destroyed. Metropolis as Lang had originally meant it to be was lost for 80 years. How fortunate we are then at the finding of an almost complete print in Buenos Aires in 2008 and the resulting glorious Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung restoration found on this release of the film by Masters of Cinema. The inserted extra material amounts to some 30 minutes of footage which does change the film quite significantly. We see much more of 'The Thin Man' (Fritz Rasp) as he follows Worker 1181 (Erwin Biswanger) back to Freder's apartment via the risque Yoshiwara District while Freder (Gustav Frohlich) takes over his job at the clock machine cum crucifix. More importantly we see a monument built to Freder's mother, Hel by Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) and key scenes between Rotwang and Freder's father, Joh (Alfred Abel) where it is revealed that both had been in love with Hel before her death during childbirth. Freder's lack of (and consequent search for) a mother and this bad father/good father dialectic enhances the importance of the scene where Freder goes crazy after catching his father with his love Maria (Brigitte Helm) in that it encourages a more overt Freudian Oedipal reading of the whole film. The extra footage puts Maria firmly in the center of the narrative as the virgin/whore mother figure who drives Freder and ultimately causes the destruction of the city. Apart from odd frames (admirably pointed out by momentary black-outs in the MoC print) only two short scenes are still missing. The first concerns Freder's encounter with a religious sect in the cathedral and a lecture by the monk Desertus (also played by Fritz Rasp). We later see the character inter-cut into Freder's hallucination following his witnessing of his father being with Maria and can guess at the sinister nature of the earlier missing sermon. The second scene is more important in that it shows how Maria escapes Rotwang's house and the last meeting between Joh and Rotwang which must be important for the trajectory of the text. Maybe these scenes will turn up some day. For the moment we should feel grateful for what we have. The picture quality is little short of astounding. Even the recovered material is not as bad as some have said. Clearly a lot of care and attention has been lavished onto the restoration. I especially appreciate the re-recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score which drives the narrative forward with tremendous swagger. The accompanying booklet is a decent job featuring an interesting article by Jonathan Rosenbaum and notes by Luis Bunuel, Karen Naundorf, Fritz Lang himself and Martin Koerber on the restoration. The only complaint I have concerns the commentary by Rosenbaum and David Kalat which pointlessly regurgitates a lot of the information given in the accompanying documentary as well as the booklet. The best things they give are quotes from other critics, especially from Tom Gunning's excellent appreciation of the film contained in his book Fritz Lang: Allegories of Vision and Modernity. These are things we can read for ourselves. I would rather have a commentary given by someone who has something fresh to bring to the table. Having read most things about the film myself, I found what Rosenbaum and Kalat have to say, frankly, redundant. The restoration doesn't exactly reveal Metropolis to be a masterpiece. It is still dramatically ill-conceived and at base level confused beyond all redemption. But this MoC release still demands to be seen. Metropolis is an important film (Ufa's Heaven's Gate if you like) which if nothing else, is a wonderful spectacle to watch, even if Fritz Lang himself would have preferred to be remembered more for Die Nibelungen and Spione.

The legendary reputation of Metropolis rests almost totally on the way it looks - its fabulous mise-en-scene. As Tony Rayns has pointed out, rarely if ever has a director worked so closely with his cinematographers (Karl Freund and Gunther Rittau), production designers (Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut and Karl Vollbrecht) and even his sculptor (Walter Schultze-Mittendorf) to produce such stunning visual and spatial effects. From the opening machine visuals behind the credits, through the designs of the city buildings intersected by trains and cars (predicting the look of downtown Tokyo by almost a century), the colossal designs of Joh's office and Freder's apartment, the stadium where the elite run for fun overlooked by Albert Speer-like statues, the garden of earthly delights where the rich frolic with their nymphs, the descent into Nibelheim where the workers man the machines, through the visualization of the Moloch machine which chews up errant workers like some death camp torture chamber, the depiction of the parable of the Tower of Babel with the hordes rushing up the steps in a grand sweeping motion of architectural grandeur, the Gothic claustrophobia of Rotwang's strange out-of-place home housing a scientific laboratory mixing up Black Magick with Frankenstein regeneration, the design of the robot Maria, the famous transformation scene where machine turns into false Maria, the designs of the nightclub scenes where false Maria turns the men wild, and then finally to the actual breaking up and destruction of the city itself which sees explosions, floods, fires, superbly choreographed crowd sequences, the spectacular immolation of false Maria, and a cathedral-top finish which has poor Brigitte Helm doing all her stunts herself, hanging from a bell chain and then running along a 200 meter high roof top! The visual designs and the sheer breath-taking bravura of the direction here reaches heights which have rarely been equaled since. It's an extraordinary testament to this film's technological achievements that 80 years later top movie directors like Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, James Cameron and others still take their inspiration from the 1926 'Metropolis look'.

If only this splendid visual virtuosity could have been married to a coherent script worthy of it's support. Here, alas, is where the film falls apart. The sheer success of the visuals really expose the inadequacies of Thea von Harbou and Lang's silly and extremely pretentious melange of everything from Karl Marx to Siegmund Freud and from occult Black Magick through to Biblical sermonizing. I think at base Tom Gunning is right to see Metropolis as ""the allegory of the future as the triumph of the machine"". Lang paints the picture of a city divided in two. Above ground you have the idle rich who, having planned and had their city built, relax and play. Below ground you have the machines which run the city and which are manned by the working class who are seen as nothing more than extensions of the machines they run. Note the way they march to work, their rhythmic motions at their respective machines, the easy way they are molded into obeying whatever they are told by the powers that be. Indeed it is in the dehumanizing of the workers and the use of the false Maria (a robot) that Harbou/Lang most successfully illustrate their point that in the city in 2026 the machines will take over. Lang/Harbou see this situation as a fundamental injustice and posit a resistance movement (aka, the early Christians in Jerusalem or in Rome) fueled by Maria who is painted as a John the Baptist figure (or is it Theodora?) who, through the allegory of the Tower of Babel voices the moral of the film screamed out at the beginning and then reiterated with such crass naivety at the conclusion - ""The mediator between head and hands must be the heart"". The film is basically the story of how the heart (Freder) brings together the head (his father and chief architect of Metropolis, Joh) with the hands (the factory foreman Grot) to circumvent the power of the machines. Except that the only figure correctly represented in this triumvirate is Joh. Yes, he is the city's inventor and the 'head' responsible. But what about his son Freder? What has he done to qualify as the heart? Apart from having the hots for Maria, showing a modicum of sympathy for Josaphat (Theodor Loos) when Joh fires him, spending perhaps half a day at work on the factory floor and having a series of fainting fits he has really done nothing in the film. He is a very poor Messiah figure, having barely suffered at all for the masses Harbou and Lang expect us to believe him to feel empathy for. His desire is not to make Metropolis a fairer place for all - all he wants is to get into Maria's knickers. And who exactly is Grot? We first see him in Joh's office giving information about the factory floor. Then we see him manning the heart machine. He refuses to let the Luddite mob into the room until Joh gives him a direct order. He opens the door and gets carried away by the general euphoria to the point where he assumes leadership (!!) of the mob especially when everyone is worried about the kids who Maria and Freder have hidden in the cathedral. Grot is basically Joh's toady, a spy who informs on the workers for his own good. Are we really to take this union between Joh and his toady by Joh's ineffectual son seriously? Whatever happens it's a win-win for Joh who (it is obvious) will continue on in charge of the city. Despite his hair turning white, the power of the machines hasn't been circumvented at all. If the machines have been temporarily destroyed then it will only be a matter of time before they are fixed and the situation reverts back to usual - dreams for social change remain very much pie in the sky. Where is the sense in this silly, cartoon-like ending? 'That's all folks!' indeed.

The main problem with Metropolis is that the bald simplicity of the main moral (head, hands, heart, etc) contradicts the film's basic allegorical nature. Allegories are designed to be read in any number of different ways. Within the over-arching machine-triumph allegory Harbou/Lang throw in references to a number of big intellectual ideas which unfortunately are never really worked through. As Tom Gunning admits, it is impossible to come up with one allegorical interpretation which explains away everything in the film whilst staying with the film's all too obvious moral. For example, it is tempting to see the split of the city as a classic Freudian division between consciousness and unconsciousness. Freder lives a carefree ego-driven hedonistic life above in the garden of earthly delights, but his conscience is pricked when Maria pays a visit with a group of kids from the factory floor. This is where the character of Hel becomes important, for it is her absence which has sent Freder on a search for a mother figure and which has halted his psycho-sexual development to the point where he can't distinguish between mother-love and erotic love. Maria is the virgin/mother figure who tips Freder into a dive down into his own unconscious sexual libidinal desires - his id as symbolized by the factory underworld. He intuits the inequalities of city life with the suffering of the workers supporting the rich life style of the elite and realizes (albeit opaquely) that he has to over-throw the power of his father to get this virgin/mother for himself - the righting of a wrong perpetuated on society is simply a by-product of his erotic desire. This Oedipal conundrum is made explicit as I have said above in the scene where he flips having seen his father intimately involved with Maria. This amounts to a 'primal scene' which awakens Freder's castration anxiety and kick starts his super-ego. As impressive as this is visually (the imaging here is extraordinarily avant-garde even by today's standards right down to the scratching of the film negative itself), it doesn't really make much sense in the text where everything heads to complete destruction as per the 'furioso' marking for the final part of the film and the destruction of good father Joh (the other half of the Oedipal equation) remains elusive. Despite all the extraordinary phallic imagery (pistons pumping, steam blasting, machines exploding, water gushing, fires raging, liquids spurting, Freder rushing to save Maria on a monument which looks like a giant mother's teat - actually a copy of a monument erected to the memory of the 1920 Kapp-Luttwitz Putsch -, and Freder's climactic ascent up the phallic cathedral spire to do battle with bad father Rotwang), the destruction of the city has less to do with Oedipal workings out of Freder's psyche (his super-ego assuaging feelings of guilt) than it has to do with a return to the kind of 'sensation film' that had been popular in Germany since the first world war and which high-brows had disparaged as being too populist.

Then we could attempt a political reading of the film with the decadent Bourgeoisie above ground lording it over the Proletariat below. We must remember German society was very unstable in 1926 with economic hardship, hyper-inflation and political instability a routine part of everyday life for contemporary audiences up until recently. The final third of the film may appear to show off this economic unrest with workers throwing off their chains and uniting for a better future. No doubt this would have triggered memories in audiences about the recent 1923 Munich Putsch and the 1920 Kapp-Luttwitz Putsch, not to mention Freder and Maria gathering the workers around a monument commemorating that event and looking for all the world like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht who were murdered by the far right during the 1919 Spartacist revolt. No doubt Goebbels noticed these 'communist' connections and had Metropolis banned as a consequence. Actually though, the rebel workers don't have their own leaders. They are being led by good father Joh through the figure of the false Maria. He wants to agitate the workers to fight so that they can be put down. This is not made clear in the film - actually, why does Joh want his city destroyed? He only becomes concerned about the destruction when his son's life is endangered. When the mob realize they have been tricked by false Maria and rush to immolate her, their rioting is marked by a distinct lack of leadership. The only viable leader-figure would appear to be Joh's toady, Grot, hardly a good representative of the oppressed classes! In any case, a successful socio-political reading of the film would have to rest on our 'hero', Freder doing two things. First, discovering his conscience sympathizing with Josaphat - this is something strengthened by the new footage in which we see a new scene between the two where Freder's sympathy for Josaphat is clearly emphasized. Second, Freder has to spend time at the machines on the factory floor. However, he disappears for a long stretch of the film towards the end and when he does appear with Josaphat in the catacombs to tell the rebel workers that false Maria is not the real Maria he is simply brushed aside. He does succeed in helping Maria free the women and children from the flooded chamber, but in every other respect he fails completely as a political leader. Indeed it is not clear he even tries to be one in the first place. As in the Freudian reading of the film, at the end, Freder simply doesn't want to get around the power of his father.

Then there is Metropolis as an allegory of the future as a dialectic between modern science and Gothic medieval occultism (old science). This is an angle which Lang was originally going to feature more strongly. Metropolis is a palimpsest, the modern part of the city built by Joh on top of the old Gothic remains associated with Rotwang. This means that occult medieval science together with modern science were jointly responsible for the city's creation. It's made clear that Rotwang's house is older than the city erected around it, and in order to counter the threat posed by Maria Joh goes to Rotwang as only he knows what the map carried by rebel workers means. Rotwang tells him the map is of the old catacombs that lie beneath the city which are (significantly) accessed through the basement of Rotwang's house. Both go down to witness Maria's Tower of Babel sermon, and it is through Joh's command to Rotwang to create an artificial Maria that he can regain control over the workers. False Maria (re Metropolis itself) is thus the creation of a union between medieval Black Magick and new scientific technology - note Lang's careful mise-en-scene depicted in Rotwang's laboratory which blends the two sciences together into a seamless whole. It's also an amalgamation of two desires - Joh's desire to command the masses through a puppet and Rotwang's desire to recreate his beloved Hel in the image of Maria. The motivations run backwards as well as forwards. As the narrative progresses we discover all the Gothic Expressionistic imagery is associated with Rotwang's world. It's unfortunate that (like so much else in the film) things fall apart in the final third. Lang originally wanted the statues of Death and the Seven Deadly Sins to come out of the cathedral and wreak havoc on the city. This was toned down (by von Harbou?) to keeping them coming alive only in the cathedral, though there is one brief passage where the Seven Deadly Sins are envisioned (in Freder's delirium?) as holding up false Maria as she does her erotic dance in the nightclub. Not showing the figures more prominently in the apocalyptic final stages severely weakens this allegorical interpretation which seems to be continued only in the music (the repeated use of the medieval Dies Irie death chant) combined with the Totentanz (the Dance of Death) of the masses. A satisfying closing-out of this apocalyptic scenario demands a complete change in the order of things which Lang/Harbou refuse to give us. Instead we have some dopey conclusion about head, hands and heart which changes nothing.

Most obviously of all would appear to be some kind of biblical allegorical interpretation although this is hardly coherent. The biblical allusions which Harbou/Lang throw in are numerous - the Tower of Babel sequence, Freder on the crucifix of the clock machine, Freder the Messiah, the early Christians in the catacombs, the Book of Revelations imagery associated with the final apocalypse, the use of biblical-sounding names (Joh, Josaphat, Maria), the use of a Gothic cathedral where Freder hears a sermon and which serves as the location for the film's final scene, Maria as virgin mother/Maria as whore. Women in the film are either virgins or whores, in the case of Maria they are both! The trouble is again these images get confused. Is Maria Jesus's (Freder's) mother or is she John the Baptist simply predicting the arrival of the mediator (Freder/the Messiah)? If religious imagery is attached to Freder, Maria and 'the masses' why is Joh not shown as some evil Herod? His behavior is decidedly gentleman-like throughout. The worst thing he does is fire Josaphat from his office. Moreover, Lang's spectacular mise-en-scene makes the city look so impressive that one wonders if Lang isn't on Joh's side after all. Alfred Abel is allowed to give Joh a dignity which exists a million miles away from some ancient Roman despot. Contrast this with the condescending attitude Lang takes towards the workers. Supposedly victims waiting for some mediator/Messiah to come and deliver them, they are pictured as mere simpletons gullibly swallowing up every word both Marias say. Lang's condescension to crowds is also a feature of his later pictures, especially M and Fury.

Throwing in allusions to intellectual heavy-weights and alluding to grand ideas might lead us to believe we are watching something significant. Actually, when technique is divorced from coherent substance the result is a pretentious mess. One possible defense of the film may well lie in accepting this confusing melange of allegorical interpretations as being closer to reality than featuring any one fixed interpretation or explanation. This is where the debate about Metropolis and post-modernism begins. The various strands of the modernist movement all sought to make sense of the world around them, assuming there is some kind of underlying order to everything. Post-modernism starts off with the assumption that there is no underlying order at all. Acceptance of confusion and the fact that the world is simply too complicated to be explained away by any one master-theory is probably the one thing most people agree on when trying to define post-modernism. Metropolis's prominent place in key post-modern texts like Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow and Philip Glass's opera Einstein on the Beach would appear to confirm its reaching towards post-modernism, along with use of its imagery by pop artists like Madonna, Pink Floyd and the like. But this is a reading of the film very much after the event. I feel it's unlikely that Lang consciously strove to move beyond the modernism of the day (most obviously shown by Expressionistic touches in the imagery associated with Rotwang and in much of the over-wrought acting), though the clash between Expressionism and the Neue Sachlichkeit (the new objectivity) would provide fascinating influences on style in his last German films, especially Spione and M. It is interesting that Spione (his next film after Metropolis) seems to continue the post-modern connection with it's depiction of Haghi's abstract criminal power over reality. Watching Spione after reading Pynchon's V (works separated by over 40 years!) is a deeply instructive experience as both seem to be breathing the same paranoid air. Post-modernism aside, whatever we make of the various possible allegorical interpretations in Metropolis, everything still has to come back to the film's absurdly simplistic moral which will always remain indigestible. This is what finally sinks the film. And yet, Metropolis looks so damned wonderful! Perhaps the best defense of the film's quality starts and finishes right there!",1411430400,7,22409,5.012614063338701

954875,5,6305013578,"I have have had numerous versions of this film over the years. A terrible version by Good Times, a terrible one by Kino International, the Giorgio Morodor rock music version released by PSO (one of the shortest versions), a fine version by Aikman Archive, and now this new Kino International release on DVD. This time Kino International got it right by getting missing scenes restored. There are still missing scenes, but those are presumably permanently lost. The restored missing scenes (taking place mostly in a taxi cab) are green tinted, I have forgotten why. I have also read read the novel by Thea Von Harbou, what takes a quite different take to that of Fritz Lang's direction, and is much better than certain critics elsewhere who have condemned her writing. The script is a melodrama. perhaps too obvious to some, but still very effective, commenting on the trials and misunderstandings of a social stratified city of the future. Lang has been praised numerous times for his grand vision, his enormous cast of extras, and for the gigantic sets used. It should be pointed out that much that has been recycled in many science fiction films were first conceived of here, such as the creation of the Bad Maria through electricity--an idea stolen later by James Whale for his inferior Frankenstein films. Also the idea of two way telephones-televisors (now called Skype) was first used here. The great overpowering image of the city, with its enormous central tower was also new at the time, though much of the concept of a unified megalopolis comes from H.G. Wells' When the Sleeper Awakes (a.k.a. The The Sleeper Wakes). Indeed as far as ideas, Metropolis is a cruder form of the ideas and concepts that HG Wells wrote in his many novels, including the general strike by the workers that devastated the city. There had been robot stories long before Metropolis, but this is the one most people remember, and the robot Futura (as she is called in the novel), also known as Hel, has become archetypical image in science fiction, her image homaged in Star Wars's 3C-PO. Yet there is much of the Gothic in the film and even more so in the novel. Though science fiction, it is also German Gothic horror tale, with the ancient cathedral, the catacombs, the fevered delusions of the walking statues -- all Gothic. Also the idea of a rich, bored aristocrat falling for a poor, common servant girl is also a cliche taken from many Gothic novels. The mad scientist Rotwang is very much a medieval alchemist and sorcerer, living in a ruined, magical house, also quite Gothic. Yet it all works,and it is more thrilling than a lot of more clinical science fiction films.

955011,5,6305013578,"Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927)

What is there to say about the magical Metropolis that has not already been said? Not a damn thing, most likely, which is going to do something very rare: shut me up. I'm just going to point you to everything from Roger Ebert's Great Films entry on the 2010 restoration, which adds almost half an hour of footage long believed to be lost (it was found in Buenos Aires in 2008; it had been cut from the original by German censors, who found it objectionable--not terribly surprising in interbellum Germany), or Jonathan Rosenbaum's 2002 review from the Chicago Reader or Thomas Elsaesser's book-length deconstruction of the film and for my part, I'm going to simply implore you to watch the silly thing, in its full, restored glory, and if you are at all a fan of fantasy, science fiction, or horror film, marvel at how incredibly influential this movie has been--you will recognize the source of dozens, maybe even hundreds, of things you've seen in movies since then. [note: sorry to those not reading this at Popcorn for Breakfast, who aren't getting all the links above.]

Note when I say ""restored"" that I don't mean the new footage is as pristine as it was in 1927. Far from it--the footage recovered in Argentina was not handled all that well (in fact, there was over an hour cut from the film; half of it was not salvageable from the Argentinian print, and what happens in those bits is supplied to us via intertitles), and the difference between the bits included here from the 2001 remaster, which look very good indeed, and the bits from the 2010 restoration is palpable. And it doesn't matter one bloody bit, ghosts of hairs and scratches on the celluloid and dust motes abound and it's still riveting stuff, the kind of movie you can watch in the 2010s and still understand that when people went to the movies in the 1920s, some of them thought they were seeing actual honest-to-filmstock magic happening. And perhaps they were. One of the all-time greats. **** ",1369872000,3,2005,4.722857142857142

Since entire segments of the movie were missing, he edited the film to be as close to the original story as you could at the time. Now with the newly found and restored version the movie makes even more sense. But I hope Moroder may consider revamping his edition as he seemed to care so much about the movie and the movie's score and make his edition a companion, not a competition to the original movie with it's own artistic merits.

955016,5,6305013578,"Unfortunately, Amazon lumped together all the reviews of the digital versions of this movie, so that the release from 2003, which is 153 minutes long and was painstakingly restored with the most amazing digital clean-up ever seen, is lumped together with reviews of ""The Complete Metropolis"" which was released in 2010 and is only 147 minutes long by comparison. Now, both of these films have their strong points to highly recommend them, and both have a down side - only by comparison. To make matters worse, the Amazon reviewer whose same review appears for each of these versions, does not offer a review that ""makes any sense"". His comments are utterly shallow, if he thinks that all of what is going on in this movie can be reduced to a ""fortune cookie"", as if the slogan the film uses is all the film is about.

Film buffs who appreciate this movie, and understand the depths of this movie will certainly appreciate both versions. The 2003 version is a much better over-all resoration - it's like watching the film when it was new and pristine, and goes very far to present the formerly missing material (and some material still missing) in a logical way that does not detract from the movie, which is a feast for the eyes. The more modern, ""Complete"" version from 2010, is actually 6 minutes shorter. It does have some of the remnants thought ""long lost"" included, however, it does not appear that they even lifted one finger to bother trying to restore it to its former visual glory. Shame on them! They finally had the long-lost footage in their hands - something that has been searched for for so many decades, and they didn't bother cleaning it up in the least!

Both versions include the fabulous musical store. So, If you want the most striking and pristine visual version. which is actually near complete, than veiw the 2003 version. If you want the version that includes every snippet of long-lost footage, and is actually a decent restoration over-all, view the 2010 version.

There is another reviewer who claims that a quarter of the movie has been lost forever. Apparently, that reviewer didn't bother to watch these versions, or perhaps, due to Amazon lumping these all together, it's hard to tell which review fits which version. Both these versions went a long way to recover what was ""lost"" and the most recent version succeeded almost 100% - finally!

This is one of the most striking films ever made, prophetici sci-fi, amazing photography and special effects, and a story that has plenty of depth - something that escapes the Amazon reviewer entirely.",1361577600,2,2577,4.797297297297297

955065,5,6305013578,"""Metropolis"" is presented here with extra footage that was long considered forever lost; we also get the original Gottfried Huppertz musical score. The plot progresses at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The musical score enhances the film and although some of the acting is a bit overdone it doesn't lessen the quality of the movie. The casting was well done and I was impressed with the special effects some of which were rather advanced at the time.

Metropolis is a giant, highly sophisticated Utopian city in the far-off future (well, considering that it was made in 1927 the far-off future is the year 2026); the wealthy elite living there have access to education, theaters, beautiful gardens and stadiums so they can enjoy a splendid, privileged exisistance. However, there is a dark side to this--the city was built and is being maintained by nameless workers all wearing dark uniforms or just rags deep beneath the ground; most of them lack names, one of them is simply called ""11811"" (Erwin Biswanger) and few of the elite are even aware of this! The city's master and director is Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) who employs Josaphat (Theodor Loos) and ""The Thin Man"" (Fritz Rasp) who also spies for him. There is also the inventor Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) to whom Joh Fredersen goes whenever his ""experts fail him;"" and Joh has a son named Freder (Gustav Frhlich) who is not responsible for managing the Utopian city.

One day, Freder is in the special gardens of Metropolis when a mysterious, beautiful woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) appears with many children of the workers from deep down below. Freder instantly falls in love with her. Before Freder can speak with Maria, however, she and the children go away--but not before Maria tells the children (and, indirectly, the elite) that they should look upon their ""brothers."" Freder goes below the city to follow Maria and he is horrified to discover the terrible struggle of the workers who must toil in nonstop 10 hour shifts, their heads bent down in submission as they march to work and leave work. Freder changes places with worker number 11811 and he pursues Maria until he finds her preaching for peace and promising the workers that a mediator representing a ""heart"" will come to join the ""head"" and the ""hand""--management and worker--so that workers can have a better existence.

Add to this a rivalry between Joh and Rotwang for Joh's late wife Hel; Rotwang's drive for revenge against Joh for past wrongdoings and fights pitting Freder against both his father and Rotwang for the fate of the workers and Maria and you have a motion picture full of action, suspense and more! Look also for what happens when Rotwang uses Maria to make a robotic clone of her; and Heinrich George turns in a fine performance as Grot, Guardian of the Heart Machine. Of course, the extra footage adds to the cohesiveness of the plot.

There's more I could tell you but I don't want to spoil it all for you. Suffice it to say that it's all quite memorable.

As for the extra features, I particularly enjoyed the documentary on the making and restoration of the film.

""Metropolis"" is one of the best German silent films; it's also one of the best silent films ever. People who like foreign silent films; classic science fiction and silent film with dark, imaginative elements will appreciate ""Metropolis.""",1340668800,2,3374,4.838821490467938
955066,5,6305013578,"From early childhood, I heard references, often wistful if not awed, to Metropolis.  When I finally saw it, I was indeed dazzled, but also left with the feeling that I had not so much visited a wonderful city of the future as toured a collection of artifacts from its ruins.  Now I have been there.

I fully believe that this film remains a high point, possibly *the* high point, of film-making.  I question whether any later director and crew, with the benefit of sound and color and special effects and the simple advantage of decades of good films to watch and learn from, have ever surpassed it.",1340409600,,599,4.570093457943925

And I believe Giorgio Moroder put the perfect musical score into this updated version.  Have seen the original film, but somehow Moroder's version seems succinct and he has perfectly infused rock and roll music to the scenes and emotions of the film.

955068,4,6305013578,"Very Art Deco, very strange, but historically vital and also pretty interesting.

Metropolis takes place in 2026, but you have to remember that it is as imagined by 1927. I believe it was Robert Heinlein (or maybe Isaac Asimov?) who said every science fiction story has three times: the year it was written, the year in which it is set, and the year in which the reader/viewer experiences it. Especially when we are far closer to the year imagined than the year in which the imagining was done, the more slack we have to cut the writer/director.

Metropolis is divided into three areas. On the top, both physically and metaphorically, are the pleasure gardens and stately homes of the privileged class. The idle rich, for the most part, but also people like the Master of Metropolis and his immediate staff. In the middle, only a little underground, are the machines. This is where the workers work, but where they live is much further underground.

One day, the son of John Fredersen, the Master of Metropolis, was in a pleasure garden chasing a teasing girl when a lovely young woman appeared at the door surrounded by workers' children, dressed in rags and looking pitiful. She admonishes young Fredersen to see his brothers, meaning the children.

He follows them, and finds himself in the machine rooms, a part of Metropolis he had never seen. He is horrified to see how the workers sweat and slave, even though most of what they are doing is turning dials and pushing buttons and watching gauges. One worker falls behind, and the temperature gauge for which he is responsible starts to go up past the warning points. Since a hallucination scene is involved here, I can't be sure how much of it is really happening. But Fredersen perceives the workers as sweating bodies being fed into the maw of Moloch.

There are a great many allegorical references to both Christian and pagan images, and one which sounded a lot like the Jewish ""let my people go"" line, and their waiting for a messiah (Mediator, in their terms). It turns out the beautiful young lady who had befriended the children is named Maria, and meets with the workers in what seems to be a religious area of some kind, with crosses and candles related to an altar, but all in a rather surreal Deco style.

For the benefit of all of you who have seen the silver robot figure (it's on the cover of the DVD case), you will find Rotwang, the inventor, to seem a great deal like Dr. Frankenstein, but with a much more complicated laboratory.

I'm not going to spoil the fun for you. Enjoy finding all the symbols and allegories, including the pentagram on a door, the whore of Babylon riding a many-headed beast, and lots of others. I will leave you with the quote which forms the basic theme, and which is displayed at the beginning of the film:

""The mediator between brain and muscle must be the heart."" This is said in several variations by several characters, but is probably a quote from Fritz Lang himself.",1336780800,2,2975,4.653333333333333
955069,5,6305013578,"Unless the few snippets that are still missing can be found--and never say never--this is probably as ""complete"" a cut of this marvelous film as we are going to get.  Like many cut films, like ""Lost Horizon"", these  restored releases that bring back the lost scenes are proof how the Company Heads don't see things from the view-point of both the directors and the audience.
  Even as a cut film, ""Metropolis"" is a eye-catching opus that allows the viewer to enter a futuristic city built upon the toil of the workers, who live beneath the city, and the upper class (you can read that as the ""one percent"".) The two finally come together at the cost of the city's infrastructure and many lives.  And while the solution seems over-simplified and possibly to some too sentimental, the film's visual power overcomes these problems.
  In a way, this could be seen as the grandparent of films as ""Blade Runner"" and, of course, CPO in ""Star Wars"".  The sequence of city scapes--with elevated roads and airplanes flying through the city are marvelous to see.  If you view the film, notice the similarities of the LAPD building in ""Blade Runner"" and the New Tower of Babylon and the Mechanical Man to the androids of the George Lucas films.  The story-line is seen in too many stories and films to note.
  Finally, while some of the actors seem to express too much--something you have to accept when watching silent films--the acting of Alfred Abel is extraordinary--especially with his face communicating the emotions of control, sorrow, lust and fear.  This is silent acting at its best as his body/facial movements speak the meanings that his mouth never could.
  It should also be noted that this is a rather adult film with semi-nudity, bordellos, and other activities that are not for younger viewers.  I would also like to plug the German version of ""Titanic"" which was made under the Nazi government--a film so well made that snippets were borrowed for Britian's superior ""A Night to Remember""--if you can get by the propaganda, you will find an interesting film.",1331683200,,2063,4.834757834757835

955154,3,6305013578,"Let me say that I saw this when it first came out and it opened up Metropolis to me.  I enjoyed the film and the music did not distract for me.  Now having said that let me also say I have all 3 versions of Metropolis now, the older B/W scratchy version with generic music, the Moroder version and the new Fully Restored Blu-Ray version.  Which one is best?  NONE OF THEM...  They are all different experiences.

The original DVD version is not worth the money, scratchy and poorly made.

The Moroder version, from a technical perspective as presented here, DARK.  You will need to up your video settings to get enjoyable playback.  This was puzzling to me until I read the box and the note from Moroder inside the box.  The print here is from an archival 35mm version.  The problem?  Normally to get the best quality you would go back to the original negative of the film (which should be 70mm not 35mm), strike off a clean copy with new stock and digitize that.  Instead they took what was likely a projection print and digitized that.  Why they did not use an original source for the 1984 version suggests that it is locked up in a rights issue so they used the best copy they had, but projection prints (even ones that are ""archived"") age.  I wish they had used a better source.  If you have the original laserdisc version from the 1980s I would keep it or transfer it over, it is likely of better quality.

The Moroder version, I prefer some aspects, sub-titles are much better than intertitles that are used on the Resotored version.  Yes, intertitles were used in 1920, I got that, but you are faced with 2-3 min of actors interacting waving arms wildly, to get an inter-title of ""Josaphat, go to my home and wait"".  No, Moroder's choice of subtitles is definetly the correct one for a modern audience.  As for the tinting, I think it adds much to the film, otherwise it has a flat perspective, watch it with the tinting on then quickly change the video settings so that it goes to B/W and you will see a great difference.  The music, yep, 1984 all over again, but some of it is quite in keeping with the spirit of the movie, the soundtrack itself (incidental music) in the machine rooms is great-much better than the lavish orchestration in the restored edition, I again put this down to a modern view of movie music.  As for the songs, some are good ""Blood from a Sone"" ""Cage of Freedom""-both of which are as songs, are spot on for today!

The Restored version, the new footage does add alot to the story, BUT again, story telling in the movies has changed from then until now.  If Lang were alive and still active, I bet he would tighten up the scenes a bit.  Some go on too long, but they reflect the editing attitudes of their time period.  The music, did not appeal to me, the Huppertiz (sp?) score while vast and lavish is also overdone for a modern audience.  As I mentioned above the incidential music, such as when you see the opening scenes of the gears and machines running superimposed is just wrong (to a modern audience) it reminded me of the old Newsreels from WWII you see in museums ""....Modern industry girds up for increase war production...."" it fits an industrial newsreel but not a movie.  The Moroder soundtrack is better here.  I also miss the tinting.

So which version is best, hard to say.  I had the pleasure today of running both on my 22 inch monitor this morning side by side, more or less doing a direct comparison.  It is clear that the Restored version is much clearer and has more details that add to the movie experience, but the Moroder version, with a tighter story, the use of sub-titles, and tinting does have value and if one wants to have a full experience one should invest in both.

In conclusion, I would also want to encourage people to consider buying the British Film Institue Film Classics monograph on Metropolis by Thomas Elsaesser, it will help you to understand what this movie is all about, how it was made, and many details that help in the plot.  I hope they update it as well to include the new footage.",1323907200,10,4068,4.452702702702703
955155,4,6305013578,"Of all the great silent films, few approach the curiously hip appeal of director Fritz Lang's futuristic 1927 German classic. It was the ""Cleopatra"" or ""Heaven's Gate"" of its day, nearly bankrupting the studio--Ufa--that produced it. Yet its influence, principally in Lang's extraordinary visual design, has been monumental. More than 80 years after its release, ""Metropolis"" remains the ""Citizen Kane"" of the science-fiction film.

Despite its influence on such movies as disparate as ""Blade Runner,"" ""Dr. Strangelove"" and Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times,"" some present-day audiences may yet agree with the famed British author H.G. Wells, who called it a ""most foolish film."" Its campy, ponderous absurdities are no less apparent in a historic new edition, which adds 25 minutes to the extant two-hour version first released in 2002.

Like too many cinematic milestones, ""Metropolis"" has suffered a long and torturous post-production history. Originally 2 1/2 hours at its Berlin premiere, it was almost immediately hacked down by its American studio backers (principally Paramount) to 90 minutes for international release. But like any good Hollywood monster, the film refused to die. It's been resurrected several times, most notoriously in a 1984 pop version by music producer Giorgio Moroder. The latest reincarnation comes amazingly by way of Buenos Aires, where archivists in 2008 unearthed a scratchy 16mm print that's as close to Lang's original as exists. That print, digitally cleaned up and married to an existing 35mm master by Germany's Murnau Foundation, has produced a 147-minute ""Metropolis,"" which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2010....

It would make for good wall display at a retro club, but as a film or a version of Metropolis by Fritz Lang.....I don't know.

The music is a distraction, the subtitles change the pacing of the film and the tints are sometimes annoying. But it can be an interesting experience to see. I would almost classify this as a seperate unique work from Fritz Lang's film.

When the film came out, I hated it because I thought it was a butchery of Lang's work and because there was a danger then that this day-glow metropolis would be preserved for the future rather than the original. But the world has changed, we have a better version of Lang's film on Blu-Ray available now than I could have ever expected then and the MTV video world era that spawned this film is itself long gone. Ironically a film that set out to preserve Metropolis because of its importance now itself needs to be preserved as a representation of days gone by.

Still heavy handed with outrageous overacting but, since Lang sought to use minimal intertitles, the film is essentially a pantomime and some overacting is necessary and appropriate. This is especially true for Brigitte Helm who must play two identical and identically clothed characters and make them instantly recognizable as different characters without a voice. She accomplishes by imbuing both of her very strong characters with distinct physical vocabularies. Besides the sets and cinematography, the movie is worth a second viewing to appreciate Helm's performances, intense physicality and the surprising strength and independence of her characters which comes as quite a surprise given what we expect of womens' rolls in films of the Silent Era.",1322092800,3,891,5.706766917293233

Once the furor died down and the film became available on VHS, it developed quite a cult following but then the video disappeared. After over 20 years of waiting, it has finally appeared on Blu-Ray and DVD and it has been worth the wait. This version, while not Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, is still worthy of being seen because of how well it's been put together. The color tints used for the film are beautiful and effective (Lang's original has no tints) and the editing of the film, paring it down to 87 minutes from over 2 hours of material, is quite masterful (instead of title cards there are subtitles which eliminates a lot of time). Some of the performers that Giorgio Moroder selected as musical accompaniment are quite appropriate especially Cycle V, Jon Anderson, Freddie Mercury, and Loverboy. Pat Benatar's HERE'S MY HEART (reminiscent of TITANIC's MY HEART WILL GO ON although it predates it by more than a decade) is a bit much as are some of Moroder's synthesized realizations but they do not detract from the overall impact the film makes.

METROPOLIS' editing was always edgy to begin with which makes it an ideal candidate to be treated like a music video. Check out the famous robot creation scene or the son's hallucinations and you'll see what I mean. Adding contemporary music to silent films is nothing new these days and Moroder deserves credit for being a pioneer by helping to bring a celebrated silent film to the big screen and to the attention of younger viewers almost 30 years ago. Now METROPOLIS is back for a limited release in theaters thanks to Kino Classics complete with a Moroder supervised restoration of the soundtrack (which now has nostalgia value) in conjunction with its first release on home video in the digital medium. See it in a theater if you can but if not, then snap up this release as it too could disappear for another 25 years. Again it's not Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (which now exists in a complete original version also from Kino), it's Giorgio Moroder's METROPOLIS and it's beautiful to look at and to listen to. It clearly shows how silent cinema is an art form unto itself and how, like other great art forms, it can be reinterpreted for future generations. This release comes with a wonderful short documentary THE FADING IMAGE which illustrates how the film was restored and then scored by Moroder.",1321747200,4,2610,4.812917594654788
955222,5,6305013578,"This is a review of Kino's The Complete Metropolis (1927) which was released in November of 2010.

Briefly, Metropolis is one of the greatest silent movies ever made and everyone who loves movies will appreciate this version.  The influence that this 1927 film has had on the whole history of modern cinema is profound.

For those who don't know about the movie.  It is a great early science-fiction morality play/love story, complete with mad scientist and an iconic robot all wrapped around a modern retelling of the Biblical Tower of Babel story for the industrial age.  This movie was inexplicable edited down right after its premi&egrave;re and has suffered at the hands of various film butchers afterwards.  In the 1970's, what was left was very poor quality versions with most of the film cut out and thought lost to history.  Through several persons and institutions, an effort was made to search the world for every piece of existing footage.  Those efforts have resulted (as of 2010) in Kino's Complete Metropolis.

Half an hour of footage was discovered after Kino's earlier restoration of Fritz Lang's Metropolis and that footage has been incorporated into this new version.  The discovery of this new footage is a cause for celebration for every movie buff.  With this footage incorporated, whole plot elements have now been restored to this great silent film.

The result however is a vast difference in the quality of the footage:  The earlier restoration is pristine while the newly discovered half hour is very poor quality.  This is not the fault of Kino, it is simply the best (read: Only) copy available and Kino worked on that footage as best they could without further loss of picture.

Furthermore, although this is titled the Complete Metropolis, there are still at least two pieces missing from the movie.  First, the fight between the mad scientist and the master of the city is still missing.  Most believe that a motivation point was part of this scene (a reason why the Master orders the gates open later in the movie).  That scene is the last important part of the film left to be discovered.  The second part still missing from the film is the scene where we would have seen the Preacher behind the pulpit (later imitated by the thin man).  The fact that these two scenes are missing does not subtract at all from the enjoyment of watching The Complete Metropolis.  We can only hope that these scenes still exist somewhere and will be discovered someday.

This version also restores the Original music made for the 1927 release.

I highly recommend this movie.

NOTE: Those looking for the 1980's Moroder version of the film (the wildly colorized short version with the Rock n Roll soundtrack) will NOT find it in this release.  However, in 2011, the Moroder version has been re-released on DVD and Blue-ray and it can now be purchased elsewhere (A version I also love and recommend to anyone who loves 1980's rock music).",1321228800,6,2953,4.846307385229541
955223,5,6305013578,"This past Friday, our local ""art house"" theater presented Metropolis.  I mistakenly thought it was the extensively restored version that Kino bills as ""The Complete Metropolis,"" but it wasn't until I was seated that someone told me this was the Moroder version.

At first I was disappointed, until the film actually started.  As it played, my mouth fell open in amazement at how well Moroder's ""contemporary"" synthesized soundtrack undergirded the film's story and visuals.  I actually found myself really, really ""digging"" the psychological effect of watching an 84-year-old silent classic married to a contemporary soundtrack.

Of course, there are spots where some of the other contributors' work doesn't really mesh well with the film, and it's in these spots that the presentation gets ham-strung.  But the parts that Moroder composed for the film are spot-on and have to be experienced to be appreciated.  Especially in the opening sequences of the film, as the laborers are going through the shift change, the emotion conveyed in Moroder's score fits so well to the visuals that words fail me to describe its effect.

I don't often use the term ""genius"" when describing anything in this day and age, but in the case of Giorgio Moroder's vision of Metropolis, genius is the only fitting appellation that can be applied.",1318723200,4,1325,5.130232558139535
955224,5,6305013578,"This is the real deal.  Granted, the recovered footage is poorer quality than the previsouly restore parts, but it rounds out the story so well, it is possible to really see what a masterful film this is.  The subplots are restored to their importance and the film just generally has better coherence now than it ever had before.  Well worth it to have a copy.",1317340800,,360,4.507692307692308
955225,5,6305013578,"I suppose if you push me I will admit I prefer silent films to any other format. I mean, if that's the choice you give me. There are a lot of reasons for this. Mostly, I think, because so many silent films were incredibly groundbreaking in so many areas including writing, direction, artistic quality, and method of acting. You can watch the growth take place right before your eyes. Despite the intervening years since their creation and release, silent films continue to resonate even today.

Metropolis is one example of such a film.

I don't know how many times I have watched this movie. Every time I see it I notice something new. I am not a huge fan of German expressionism, although I do like it. But Metropolis appears as if it combines story and art on such a high level of genius it is no surprise that it's considered to be Fritz Lang's magnum opus.

One of the best parts about the film is how it looks so believable. I think the closest any modern day science fiction film has come to making me truly believe in the futuristic background and culture is Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. But Metropolis did it first. It may even be the best interpretation of a futuristic society bar none. I think this might be due in part to the temporal distance involved. We know the names and biographies of the actors in Metropolis, but they have no real connection to our lives in any tangible cultural sense. Whereas when I watch Blade Runner I can't help but think ""Hey, that's Harrison Ford up there.""

Of course, I know some of the names of the characters in Metropolis. But they aren't culturally tied to me, so I think that gives them a sort of freedom and makes the film itself a tabula rasa for anyone else who comes to it for the first time. When we watch any film, no matter what it is, we always bring our past experiences with us and draw upon them to help us understand what we are seeing, and process it. This is why going to movies, and reading, and attending operas and ballets and other forms of entertainment endure. They demand that we draw upon our past experience in order to interpret them. There is not only a social connection being made but a psychological one, too. I think as human beings we like that process. We understand it, or at the very least feel comfortable with it.

We know Harrison Ford, at least through his modern day work. Most of us like him. We don't know Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Gustav Frolich and others who appear in Metropolis. That distance lends itself to an even deeper commitment of our suspension of disbelief, I think. What I mean is, the characters themselves don't lurch us out of the film and back into reality because they are, for the most part, completely unknown to us. We come to them somewhat empty and unformed and let them help us fill in the tapestry of the film-going experience.

From the decimal clocks to the mechanistic and dehumanizing social stratification, Metropolis presents myriad and multi-layered facets. As a writer this fascinates me as well. Fritz Lang is juggling a lot of crystal balls with this movie, and he keeps them in the air and moving in an intricate pattern. It's an incredible artistic accomplishment given the breadth of the work.

The art direction for Metropolis set the bar. It is phenomenal. Even when you consider the sense-shattering impact of German expressionism, there are so many elements to Metropolis, so much packed into every scene without either the story or the look of the film becoming top heavy, that it just melds together as one entity. As for story, which as a writer I tend to concentrate on above all else, it works, too. Oh, the basic qualities of the story are a bit long in the tooth: a social and economic clash between two distinct classes, blah blah blah. But even old stories gain new life when they are peopled by actors who interpret their characters as three-dimensional beings. I find the actors did an admirable job of this in Metropolis. We've seen the basic story before. We have not seen this interpretation before, I don't think. At least, not played out like this.

Of course, of all the cast, it is Maria, played by Brigitte Helm, who stands head and shoulders above everyone else. From her transformation from Christ-like figure to robot, she is right on target and completely steals the movie. Her image continues to endure right down to today.

Watching the evil Maria Robot I also get the impression a lot of background work went into developing that character. Watch how Maria moves and interacts with the other actors. Watch her facial expressions, her gestures, the small moments she brings to the screen. It is like nothing I have ever seen in any other science fiction film -- ever.

Today, when we see robots on the silver screen, they either move in some mechanistic stop-and-go action, or like any other ordinary human being so they can hide among us. Think C-3PO from Star Wars to Number Six in the Battlestar Galactica remake as separate ends of the knowable spectrum. But Helm's interpretation of Maria is the only truly inhuman robot I think I have ever seen. She moves and acts and gestures like something completely and totally alien to our experience. It is an amazing feat, and it is downright creepy.

To be sure Metropolis is not a perfect film. The philosophy ""The mediation between head and hands must be the heart"" becomes repetitious and I can't help but wonder if we are not losing something in the translation from the original German which accounts for its awkwardness. There are also the usual filmatic standardizations and slogging character development that we have to suffer through upon occasion.

But for the most part this film rocks. One of the best parts is fans and collectors are always finding new snippets excised from the original film stock. So over the years they have built and patched the film into the original shape Lang meant it to be viewed in.

I like Metropolis. As someone who works in genre I can't deny the impact the film has had upon science fiction. As someone who loves film, I can't deny the impact it has had upon the industry as a whole. It's just amazing to me how a film can reach higher than itself and become almost atavistic to genre. As iff all that has passed since its release must by necessity narrow down to the nexus of its existence and draw creative sustenance from there.

I think Metropolis does that, at least on a small level, if not large. It reaches beyond itself and becomes something greater, not just in flim but as it relates to knowable human experience. In the process, we are swept along and bounced from crest to wave.

It is a fascinating ride through the fabric of imagination and culture. Anyway, that was, and continues to be, my experience when I watch this film.",1316736000,6,6797,4.615066225165563
955226,5,6305013578,"All those years I've been hanging on to my VHS copy of this version, now finally it's coming out in (hopefully) good quality. Many people hate this film, or rather this edition, but I liked it then and still do.
Metropolis would probably have sunk into total oblivion, had not Giorgio Moroder generated new interest in this classic by presenting it to a new audience.",1315353600,21,367,4.661538461538462
955227,5,6305013578,"I first watched Metropolis about a year ago on a VHS version. I thought it was a very good movie, but it was certainly no masterpiece. The visual effects and backgrounds were striking and unique, but the picture was not particularly clear. The story was interesting but didn't make a lot of logical sense. The editing was all over the place in a way that made it difficult to follow what was going on. And most annoyingly the music had absolutely no relationship to what was happening on screen. Recently I attempted to rewatch this film in the version contained in a public domain boxed set. Unfortunately the picture quality was so bad that I gave up after only five minutes.

Then I purchased Kino's Complete Metropolis, and it is almost like watching a whole new film. A reasonably good historical oddity of interest only to cineastes and sci-fi fans is now a masterpiece which can be fully appreciated by the general viewing public. Essentially four things were done to this edition: restoring nearly a half hour of lost footage, cleaning up the picture quality to pristine, re-editing the film for a more logical flow, and including the musical score which was originally composed for the theatrical premiere.

SCORE: The orchestral score is amazing. Never in my life have I seen a silent film where the music matched the picture so well. It changes with the mood of the story, and it even matches rhythmic action. When the workers operate the machines by moving their bodies in jerky, German rhythm, the orchestra keeps a perfect beat.

PICTURE: I cannot praise the picture quality of this DVD enough. It is obvious that some of the best digital restoration experts in the world worked on this project. You can see a tear run down a man's face. You can see a woman's nipples through her sheer dress. You can see automobiles and airplaines commuting around Upper Metropolis with perfect clarity. You can even read signs on buildings. Special effects from the 1920s stand up extremely well today. Flashes of electricity look every bit as good as Emperor Palpatine's lightning fingers in Return of the Jedi. The Isaac Asimov-esque robot, the massive flood, the large-scale destruction of the undercity, the masses of vehicles travelling outside, the huge interactive set-pieces - every visual element of this movie is absolutely stunning. Not a single thing looks cheesy or dated.

RESTORED FOOTAGE AND RE-EDITING: 25 minutes of lost footage has been restored throughout the film. It's source is an extremely damaged film reel that has a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film. You can tell the restored footage from the rest of the movie because there is a small black bar at the top of the screen to compensate for the aspect ratio differences, but it is done so well that you don't notice it unless you are looking for it. Also the restored footage, since it is so damaged, appears slightly faded and has numerous vertical bars running down the screen. Although the restored footage is not nearly as clean and pretty as the rest of the film is, it is still much better than the uncleaned public domain versions of this movie I had seen previously. These added scenes and shots taken from highly damaged film still look better than your average unrestored public domain schlock.

The cleaned up old footage was combined with the newly discovered footage, given new subtitles, and edited to be as close to the original as possible using a variety of sources. When a scene known to have originally existed is now lost the editors added title cards to explain what happens in the missing footage. I only remember this happening two times during the movie, and both times the explanation was not intrusive. Much of the restored footage consists of transitions, face shots, and various other short shots that help the editing to flow better. I'll give you an example. When young Fredersen is in his father's office, his father fires on of his employees. The man leaves the office sadly knowing that he will now have to work in the undercity. The two Fresersen's remain in the office and talk, and then the son leaves. In the unrestored version we then see the back of a man walking down a stairwell but cannot see his face. One may wonder who this man is, where he is going, and what is the relevence of this scene. In the restored version a face shot is inserted, and we can see that it is the man who has just been fired, dejectedly resigned to his fate and heading below. It's a little thing, but those little things add up. Those little additions contribute to plot understanding, character development, and narrative flow.

There are also entire subplots that have been restored. The elder Fredersen orders a character known as the Thin Man to spy on his son. In unrestored versions we don't see the Thin Man again until much later when he is back in Fredersen's office. In this newly restored version we see all of the previously excised scenes of the Thin Man spying, and he is quite creepy sitting behind a newspaper and wearing heavy eyeliner. The Thin Man also commits a murder, something that happens to be important to the plot but we never got to see before. Another subplot that has been newly restored involves young Freder becoming aware of his destiny when a pastor reads him a passage from the book of Revelation.

One of the biggest missing plot pieces of all has also been restored: why Rotwang the inventor makes his robot invention rebel against Joh Fredersen and incite complete chaos. It turns out that Rotwang is in love with Joh's dead wife. He believes that Joh has disrespected the memory of his wife. Also Rotwang is angry because he originally intended to create the robot in the likeness of the dead woman, but Joh ordered him to make it look like Maria. Now Rotwang is not just some mad scientist but actually has some motivation.

There are a few things about the plot that still don't make perfect sense. Why would Fredersen fan the fires of discontent to start an uprising against himself? Why would the mob destroy the machines that keep their own neighborhood above water? Although the plot is much much clearer, there are a few things that don't make perfect sense. But these are no fault of the movie but can rather be attributed to the illogical state of human nature. Sure Metropolis has plot holes, but they are no where near as big as the paradoxes in modern sci-fi classics like the Matrix and the Terminator.

I want to add one final thing about the actress who plays Maria (I don't have her name in front of me at the moment). She was an incredible actress. Yes her acting style was melodramatic (perhaps even vaudevillian), but it was necessary for this kind of film. She could communicate a character just through a facial expression and tell an entire story with her body language. You could tell just by one look whether she was playing Maria or the robot who looked like Maria. Had she been around a few decades later (at that age) she could have been a James Bond girl. There is one scene where Maria is running from Rotwang through the catecombs and she is frightened by seeing human skeletons in every corner. That scene is pure Indiana Jones. Great adventure stuff there.

It was found in South America but was a 16mm print from an original 35mm print, but they used the wrong gate that facilitates the optical track, and so some of the film (a small portion at the top of the screen) is cut off. The restored SA sections (about forty five minutes!) are sometimes startling in the imagery, but doesn't help the weak plot. But as is often said, it's more an historical issue than artistic. My biggest complaint about the Complete version is the rerecorded soundtrack music. Here ya are watching a restored (they really couldn't do that much with the 16mm print, it looks bad no matter what anyone says, esp when compared to the scenes where they used the 35mm restoration from the camera negative)... silent film with re-recorded soundtrack in pristine stereo, and the soundtrack music is maudlin, really. But, it's a silent picture, you can just turn it down. But having that score and finding the original German title cards (for the censors) in the order they were meant to go enabled them to put the film back together in exact sequence. I'm wondering what this ""authorized"" version is, it isn't complete. The complete version was only released last year. Stay away from the colorized cut with pop music for a soundtrack...

955293,4,6305013578,"Metropolis:
Freder Is A National Socialist Hero
Metropolis is ruled over by a She-Devil the ""Man Machine"". Mr. Frederson, the head of the industrial city which is probably Berlin, adores her and worships her. He can't see beyond her and at night sits passively in his chair and gazes out at the lights of the town that have a glittering surface allure.

The corruption of Weimar, Germany is everywhere in the 20's film. We have gaudily clad girls in flapper suits going up and down the elevators putting on makeup and looking at themselves in pocket mirrors. We have dancing girls who look like a cabaret show. We even have the Thin Man with a wicked grin and a slick suit. He positively reeks of moral decadence.

Meanwhile the ""good woman"", Maria, is down below with the workers underground. But she preaches long endurance and suffering, not action. She is looking for a mediator to come to them and finds him in Mr. Frederson's son, Freder.

In typical National Socialist style, Freder must aggressively assert himself and throw off the influence of decadent women to get anywhere. Though inspired by Maria, he does all the work himself. At the end of the film she can only point to Mr. Frederson trying to shake the hand of a worker. It takes Freder to make their hands meet. Men must be men, not womanish. That was what was wrong with Weimar, Germany. It allowed the women to take over. We are reminded that Goebbels liked this film.

955294,4,6305013578,"After watching the film Metropolis, I feel like the best part of the film was the striking visuals. Not only did they have a grand set, but the overall choreographed feel of the film made it seem bigger. Seeing a large group of people all doing the same thing at the same time is very powerful and this film uses that to its advantage. The scene of the factory workers that is very choreographed is, to me, one of the most powerful and interesting scenes in the movie. The scene with the group going up the stairs is also quite powerful as it is both grand and choreographed. One of my favorite parts of Metropolis is the original score by Gottfried Huppertz. Since Metropolis is a silent film, the score plays a vital role in conveying what can not be expressed through words. The score is bold when the scenes are large and it gets softer for the more tender moments in the film. Without the score, the film would be lacking. Of course, the film is wonderful and the shots are breathtaking at times, but without the sound to complete the experience, the audience would not be as emotionally involved. Besides the score, I really enjoyed the large scenes of the city because they seem to take you to a world so different from what you know. The city is huge and very technologically advanced, and though we have large cities with huge factories, Metropolis has a dream-like quality very different from what we know. The film is exciting and has a great storyline that keeps the audience interested. I would recommend this to any fans of film or to anyone who likes science fiction.

This film transcends time in that it resonates to this day and will so in the future. This is German Expressionism at its best. Lang explores society in a disturbing and alarming class-conscious outlook. The film comments heavily and criticizes capitalism. Set in a daunting and massive futuristic city, the viewer is allowed entry into the world of the workers and the privileged. The visual effects and propaganda-like design are incredibly impressive. Cubist artists must revel when watching this film. Exploring with music and effects this film is a spectacle. Considering that this film was made during the beginning of the Nazi regime, it is not in the least bit surprising that the Nazi Party fell in love with this film. This film speaks to the masses in its commentary on capitalism and the harrowing effects of a class-conscious society. Perhaps the most notable difference in the different releases of the film is the film's score. The jazz that plays in the background for one release is surprisingly ineffective... this would be my only critique against the film. Often in silent films this is a problem for modern audiences but I think had this film been made with a futuristic score, something sweepingly dark and moody, this film would be more powerful (if that is possible). I highly recommend this film to anyone that is interested in German film, design, expressionism, architecture, etc. I've seen this film four times now and I would still be glad to see it again.

Without ""Metropolis"", there would be no ""Forbidden Planet"", no ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", no ""Star Wars"", and no ""Avatar"". That this film was made over 80 years ago, with visual effects, scale, art direction and cinematography that are still mindblowing to this day, is a great testament to the trailblazing work Fritz Lang and his cast & crew achieved with this landmark film. Yes, the acting is a bit cheesy, and so is the allegorical tale about the heart mediating the hand and mind. But ya know, for this particular film, it really doesn't matter---""Metropolis"" IS a silent movie from 1927, and the over-the-top acting and screenwriting style used in this film was simply par for the course back then. It's just the way they made movies back in 1927, and I accept that. And any shortcomings in the acting and script for ""Metropolis"" are more than made up for by all of the film's splendid, groundbreaking visual treats, of which there is plenty.

Originally 153 minutes long when it premiered back in 1927, ""Metropolis"", sadly, has been horribly sliced and diced over the years, with some prints running as short as 90 minutes, as well as elements of the story being completely changed in the process. For many, many years, it seemed that a whole hour of the original ""Metropolis"" had been lost forever. But in 2002, a newly restored version of ""Metropolis"" was made with an additional 34 minutes of discovered footage, bringing the running time up to 124 minutes. (This version of ""Metropolis"" is still highly enjoyable, and is definitely worth having in your DVD collection.) And it appeared that the restored 2002 version would be the definitive version of ""Metropolis"" forevermore. But then, in 2008, a miracle happened: a nearly-complete, 148-minute 16mm print of ""Metropolis"" was discovered in a film vault in Buenos Aries, Argentina. It was badly scratched up, but nonetheless it contained nearly the entire original version of ""Metropolis"" as Fritz Lang originally created it (with only about 5 minutes of footage still missing, probably for good). The restoration team digitally cleaned up the missing 25 minutes of footage as much as humanly possible, and now, for the first time on DVD, we have ""The Complete Metropolis"" (well, nearly complete). And it's WONDERFUL!

What a treat it is to watch this new, nearly-complete ""Metropolis"" on DVD---it's a whole new movie now. Although it's disappointing that the newly-discovered footage is of lesser quality than the rest of the film, I'm just happy to be able to watch it at all---the revelation that Fredersens's ""butler"" was actually working for him as a spy; the mini-adventure with worker 11811; that amazing elevator in the apartment of Freder's friend (you've really gotta see it!); the revelation that the worker mob were initially chasing the *real* Maria through the streets and not the robot Maria; and that beautiful, eye-popping statue of ""Hel"" (aka Helen). Wow. And, of course, there's more to enjoy now of the performances of the cast, including Gustave Frohlich as Freder and the eternally-lovely Brigitte Helm as Maria. What a treat to finally see it all (nearly) at last.

I know Fritz Lang would be very pleased to have his ""Metropolis"" nearly restored to it's original length and glory at last, and he is smiling. And I am too! I thank The Big Guy upstairs that this miracle, nearly-complete print of ""Metropolis"" has survived for us to enjoy. With ""Metropolis"", Fritz Lang helped to shape the sci-fi film genre as we know it today. Thank you, Mr. Lang, for this classic, sci-fi masterpiece.",1300060800,4,3660,4.99672131147541
955329,3,6305013578,"This is one of those films where there was a supposedly ""perfect"" version at one time that was lost, For decades after, there was an endless search for the missing pieces that would recreate the original supposed masterpiece. This film is probably as close as anything will ever get to the original. And ultimately, for all the good things about the restoration that were accomplished, the film still is a mess with a plot that often makes no sense.

Those involved did great work in putting this together. And its definately the ""definitive"" version of the film. It looks far better than any previous release. The score very well done and is ultimately better than the material it is put to.

The film's plot fails because it presents multiple contradictory narratives. In one, Joh Fredersen, leader of the city, gets into conflict with the workers who maintain his city and he ultimately destroys the city himself. In another, mad scientist Rotwang wants revenge and destroys the city. There is also a sub-plot about Fredersen's deceased wife where the mad scientist wants to make a robot that looks like the wife and get revenge but it seems like that idea was abandoned fairly early. The film also presents a fourth theme which is a christian end-of-days religious theme. But that goes nowhere too. What difference does it make for the robot to corrupt the rich boys in the nightclubs if the main plot is about the robot stirring up a revolution? Then again, what was the ruler of the city's plan which required the city to be destroyed? (he ordered the gates to the heart machine opened). Its possible to contrive explainations for the mangled plot, but no matter how many explaintions are offered, it still looks like a mess.

There are transitions and breaks in the aciton which still make no sense even with all the added footage. What seemed in previous versions to be gaps or misorderings in the footage now seems clearly to be sloppy storytelling on the part of Fritz Lang.

If anything, this version illustrates the problems of the original film and why many of the American edits were made. The american edits didn't necessarly improve the clarity of the narrative, but they did eliminate many extranious elements in the film.

Lang himself didn't seem like the film much especially in later years. To him, any solution to the ""class struggle"" other than successful violent total marxist revolution was nonense.

The film is visually interesting but ultimately its visual style is rather empty. The modernism of endless concrete was original and rather futuristic when the film was released. But it creates the opposite impression now. The effects for the era are original, creative and outstanding. Its possible to see the influence the visuals of the film had on many later films.

For inexpliciable reasons, the title cards are in English rather than the original german with subtitles. If they were going to go all out for a restoration, they should have gone all the way.

In summary, this is outstanding restoration of an extremely flawed film. Now that we have what amounts to a full version, people need to take a look at the film objectively. And what I found when I did so was a mixed up story that appears to have changed several times during filming. The failure of Fritz Lang was in not building a stable narrative in editing the film.",1298851200,5,3361,4.802768166089965
955330,5,6305013578,"The 1927 silent film classic by Fritz Lang has been brought back to life.  Even in its previous truncated and confused condition, Metropolis was rightly considered one of the greatest films of all time.  Now, in this beatifully restored and virtually complete edition, its brilliance is even more in evidence.
With the 2008 discovery in Argentina of a 16mm print containing almost 30 minutes of additional footage, the film is closer to Lang's original vision than it's been since its Berlin premiere.
While it's true the restored footage still has its flaws, the restorers have done an excellent job considering what they had to work with.  A few of the transitions between the 'lost' and existing footage are jarring on first viewing, but that is a minor complaint.

955334,5,6305013578,"It's been many years since I last saw this film - and that was probably the ""colorized"" version with a pop score by Giorgio Moroder back in 1985 (just for curiosity sake, of course). When I heard that Kino was releasing this restored version I was really excited, as they are one of the top ""classic film"" reissuing companies. Upon watching this DVD (I don't have a blu-ray player and the contents on both the BD and the standard DVD are the same) I realized it was worth the wait. Pieces of the story that made no sense before were now brought into focus (no pun intended). And the score sounds great,

Other reviews posted here will tell you more of the technical details, and I see quite a few comments about how the footage restored from the recently discovered 16mm print, should have been ""cleaned up"" before this release was made. My opinion is that such a task will take years and I may not be here to see it. At least now we have the best, and as complete, print one could hope for.

The bonus materials are superb too. There is a full-length documentary on the making of and restoration of the film. Of course, I'd loved to have seen the actual lab work that was done. But I can't really gripe. The brief interview with the curator of the archive in Buenos Aires - where the missing footage was located - is like a detective story and certainly adds to understanding how this restoration came to be.

On most DVDs, I prefer to watch the bonus features ( the now-requisite ""Making of...."" Featurette, deleted scenes, etc) after watching the feature. In the case of this release, I recommend that you watch the Bonuses (which are on a separate second disc) before settling in to watch the film. I think you'll appreciate the restoration even more.

We all owe the folks at Kino a great deal of gratitude for making this film available so soon after the footage was located and putting together a class package at a price well below what Criterion would have listed it at.

But, based on some other reviews here, I thought there might be a complete dropoff in film quality for some of the restored footage.  Yes, some of the added footage is different in quality from the stock I remember from my older Kino version, but it actually fits well and the visual change is not as jarring as I had been led to believe from some reviews here.  In addition, though I had watched the film numerous times, the added footage definitely HELPS THE STORY make sense.  The two characters in the movie whose motivations and actions are finally clear, when they weren't before, are Rotwang and the Thin Man.  Those two characters are integral to the story, and they finally make sense.  And the role of the club Yoshiwara (sp) finally makes sense.  The restorers involved in this project do not need my blessing, since that has been rendered by film experts much more knowledgeable than me.

Current sci-fi's beware, this is a ground breaking first film, and as such suffers some the acting and staging conventions of the silent era and early film.  It's theme, as most sci fi movies do, focuses on current concerns in society expressed in futuristic terms.  This one deals with the very real conflict of labor, management, class warfare, and machine phobia of the immediate era preceeing it.
It is an excellent ground breaking movie of its time and its value is one of being first in many areas, including special effects.

955367,5,6305013578,"On 7 November 2010, Turner Classic Movies had a preview showing of the new 2010 restoration of the movie ""Metropolis,"" along with a showing of the documentary of the discovery of the Argentine print in 2008. I unfortunately missed the first 20 minutes, and came in around the scene at Joh Fredersen's office at the New Tower of Babel. Also, from owning the 2002 version, there did not appear to be any major lost footage there (and if there was, they did not place the text boxes describing it). From this point on, however...

WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE!

The film actually makes sense! There are little shots interspersed here and there that explain confusing scenes (for example, Josaphat's story in Part III actually has a proper resolution) and the editing is much easier to follow than the 2002 version since you don't have to stop and imagine what is happening, and especially an old Macaday Video release I have which makes no sense, and weird re-editing of scenes creates terrible juxtapositions and headache inducing plot holes, not to mention the fact that the manipulated newsreel footage from ""Citizen Kane,"" which infuriated everyone who saw the movie in 1942, looks much better than that transfer.

No real explanation of the plot of the film needs to be given, as it has been reiterated many times over on Amazon reviews, and assumptions made by historians about the pace and plot of the original 153 minute version of ""Metropolis"" are astoundingly correct, even down to the editing of lost scenes, which matches the 2002 text boxes almost exactly with the additional correction. Certain aspects are clarified a bit more. Examples of this clarification include the sermon scenes in the Cathedral and Freder's bed which show an illustration of the Whore of Babylon depicted as the Machine-Man is on the back of the dragon, and also we see exactly how the Seven Deadly Sins enter the nightclub,.

Among the major new scenes are the introduction of Hel at Rotwang's house, 11811 at Yoshiwara, the Thin Man tailing 11811 and kidnapping him, Freder and the Thin Man at Josaphat's apartment, the destruction of the M-Machine, Freder's delusion in its entirety, the destruction of the Workers' City, expanded chase sequences at the end, and a plethora of new establishing and motif shots.

At least two scenes are missing, due to degraded film quality from improper storage causing them to be destroyed; these are Rotwang and Joh Fredersen's fight leading to Maria's escape, and the sermon scene in the Cathedral in Part II, although a still of the Bible page explaining the Whore of Babylon is kept. The new version is about 147 minutes, meaning that even with these two small scenes gone, the film is essentially complete.

The quality of the film varies wildly, and while in the 2002 version you can somewhat tell if one section was transfered from a higher or lower quality stock, and all of this footage is kept as well, but the new footage is easily discernable. The quality, to say the least, is deplorable. A layer of scratches covers it so much that no restoration could possibly remove it. It also has a lower contrast and can appear a bit fuzzy. Also, since it was found on a 16mm reduction of the original 35mm negative, some of the edges are cropped off a bit, and this is easily noticeable as black boxes surround the footage since it is not the same area as the already restored footage. I greatly applaud the F.W. Murnau Stiftung for their attempts to restore this footage to a level that is viewable, and thankfully although you have to adjust to the lower quality, it is surprisingly clean if you compare it to the unrestored footage as seen in the documentary.

I wish to make a correction from my original review:

The documentary I originally discussed was a TCM exclusive, and NOT the one featured on the DVD release. I have not yet seen then DVD documentary (about the complete history of the movie up until this release), but I find it a crying shame that the documentary about its rediscovery was not included as it provides many insights into the entire process. An interview with the director of the Museo del Cine, Buenos Aires is included, and she discusses the details of the history of the Argentine print, which is is nice though.

As with the 2002 version, the original Gottfried Huppertz score is retained in its entirety, but astute viewers can tell that the orchestration is completely different as it was completed by someone other than Berndt Heller (the orchestrator and conductor for the 2002 version) and although I prefer his version, it is nice to hear the score with all the missing sections kept in. I personally consider this score to be the greatest of all silent film scores, even better than Carl Davis's restored scores, all of which I consider to be fantastic.

Any fan of Metropolis DEFINITELY HAS TO GET THIS VERSION, as it is the ONLY possible version of the film worth owning now (owners of the 2002 version should still keep it, as I do not know if its special features are retained here), and all can rest easily knowing that the original version can be seen in its (almost) entirety with little worry about how confusing it is.",1289952000,9,5190,4.756666666666667

The original versions were dull and confusing (although visually interesting) because of the merciless over-editing made after its first release.  The Moroder version was interesting in that, apart from the 1980s score, it was while viewing this version that I first learned about just how many scenes were lost to history;  these edited scenes were destroyed during WWII and were reincorporated into Moroder's version via ""stills"" and extensive sub-titles -- this was annoying and still confusing, and not totally convincing in some scenes.

The complete version incorporates the recently discovered 30 minutes of film found in Argentina!  So you can see this movie sooner, let me be brief.

If you like the original version - you will love this new complete version ten times more. But if, like me, you were disappointed and/or confused by the disjointed scenes and experienced head-scratching moments when you said to yourself things like: ""Why the hell does the Maria/Maschinenmensch become a burlesque dancer at Yoshiwara's?"" Well, this version finally explains it!  Also, I was never quite sure who was the biggest bad guy in the film:  Rotwang?  Fredersen? Der Maschinenmensch? Or someone else, like Fredersen's spy?  Who is to blame for the final destruction of Metropolis?  With this release, its now clear.  Even the minor characters are complete three dimensional characters, not silly caricatures as in edited versions.  Fully explored and realized is the recurring theme of the Maschinenmensch as the ""Whore of Babylon"", and how this is interwoven with the Seven Deadly Sins dream sequence.

One of the complaints with the 2003 release was that the newly recorded music score was complete but didn't cue up properly with the still incomplete film.
This film's score works marvelously! It is, again, newly recorded in 5.1 surround sound and matches perfectly with the film's action. In that regard, if it weren't a silent film, the audio track on the added 16mm restored footage would probably sound horrible. Because the film's sound exists only of the wonderfully recorded score, the really grainly film scenes suffer no audio compromise.

The newly discovered and restored scenes are, indeed, very grainy and noticable. By stark contrast, the scenes which are very clean are beautiful, especially for a film from 1927. Juxtoposing both are certainly noticable, but given the importance of this film and the opportunity to flesh this story out as completely as possible is a concession worth making.

955423,5,6305013578,"The film Metropolis has been a major obsession of mine since viewing a documentary on the old 1960's series The Twentieth Century hosted by Walter Cronkite that if memory serves me correctly was entitled ""Science Fact or Fiction"".  Only a clip of Metropolis was shown at the time but that clip of the hero Freder going below the city and seeing the machines and the humans tied to them that actually ran the city haunted me for years.  To me those machine had to lay at the bottom of the poles that ""The Jetsons"" twenty first century homes rested on.  In those pre video or dvd days there was no way for an elementary school kid to view a silent German film.  So instead I read everything I could on the film including the novelization.  It was not until the late 70's that I was able to view a print of Metropolis and that was through a PBS airing.  This was the standard abridged print that was in circulation at the time.  It was not until the release of the Giorgio Moroder reconstruction in the 1980's  did I feel I had actually seen the real Metropolis.  I purchased that version on VSH tape as soon as it became availible.  I later even bought a copy of the inferior earlier release on DVD so that I could compare the two.  In 2002 I dragged a friend to the theater to watch that latest reconstruction and was just below away by it.  Never had Metropolis made more sense (outside of the novelization).  As soon as that version became availible on DVD I purchased it.  My friend warned me that I had better wait before buying this release because he felt more missing footage might be found.  Knowing the history of the film as well as I did I couldn't believe a more complete cut of the film could ever be presented.  Now about eight years later I learned that a complete print of the film had been found.  I knew that as soon as this print became availible for home use I would be purchasing it for my collection.

Metropolis is the story of a city that allows complete luxury for the wealthy by enslaving the poor. The city founded Joh Fredersen exerts complete control; crossing him means being sent to the depths. His son Freder becomes curious about the men below and he spends time with the workers. He quickly discovers their horrible living conditions, and finds out about a peaceful revolutionary group that meets in the catacombs. Maria leads the meetings where she speaks about a mediator that will come and remedy the division between the wealthy and the poor. Joh finds out about her and encourages a mad scientist to copy her image into the form of a robot. He then uses the robot to control the masses and try to take away their power. Freder fights back.

The new footage adds a new dimension to the film. (It is obvious which pieces are new, because they are not restored with the digital restoration process used on the old footage.) We see 11811 galavanting around town to the nightclub where the robot seduces the men. The Thin Man gets more screen time, and he becomes a very memorable character. There is more development in the relationship between Joh and Rotwang too. The biggest difference is the pacing. Before, Metropolis felt like an art film that required a lot of imagination and interpretation. Now, it is a complete silent film experience. The message is clearly explained and the story is fully developed.

Horray for the new Metropolis!",1285200000,7,1561,4.731617647058823

The Cleveland Museum of Art showed it in high definition with a new recording of the original score.  It was marvelous!  The additional footage (which is rather grainy, making it evident which parts came from the 16 mm negative) included: the adventures of 11811,the worker who trades places with Freder; the Thin Man spying on Josephat; Maria's incarceration; Rotwang's gloating and Maria's subsequent escape; and scenes which establish the longstanding rivalry between Joh Fredersen and Rotwang.  The added sequences made a tremendous difference to the flow of the story!  I can't wait to add this to my collection.",1284768000,8,1019,4.976470588235294
955426,5,6305013578,"Have not seen this yet, but am eagerly anticipating it.  I do own the previous restored DVD of METROPOLIS put out by Kino, and that one was excellent (by what I read, I will probably hold on to that one for the excellent special features).

Now if only someone would give the same treatment (please, please, Kino...?) to the 1925 silent classic THE LOST WORLD, a film that has been similarly gutted of much of its original footage, and has only been seen as a shadow of its original running time. While the Image Entertainment DVD released in 2001&nbsp;] is an improvement over previously-available versions, much of the original footage is still missing. I understand there are several individuals who have been involved in a quest to gather fragments of unseen footage from that film for the last 15 or 20 years, and while the complete version may never be reconstructed, it seems for a landmark film that was so influential in the history of cinema, little attention has been given to presenting the public with a deluxe treatment of this important film. While it's true that you can't find what no longer exists, it seems to me greater efforts need to be made along these lines, and soon, as the self-destruction of film stock from this era is inevitable (it's like a ticking time-bomb).

Much effort has been devoted to seeking out better and more complete prints of the films of Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, Louis Feuillade, Georges Melies, and others, but I can't understand the seeming lack of interest towards THE LOST WORLD.",1284163200,,1531,4.7481203007518795

955468,5,6305013578,"Tonight I saw the presentation of Metropolis, Fritz Lang's 1927 masterpiece -- many scenes thought lost were re-discovered and put together by Kino Video, which is slated to be released in November 2010.

The scenes that were missing were black-streaked since these parts were originally badly damaged.  You can see the difference between these scenes and the cleaned-up, restored scenes.  English subtitles with some of the German language scenes and nice, bright white, easily read fonts graced the screen.

What an interesting story!  And so complex!

Lessons:  The Machine is All!  The machine must be tended to at all times.  When the workers change shifts they march into work, slow, heads down, laboring, laboring, laboring.  The whistle blows after a ten hour shift.  Then they go below to the underground workers' city deep in the earth.

The industrialist brain behind this shiny, bright city is Joh Fredersen.  His son Freder is a playboy who gets his pick of the women at The Club of the Sons.  He's checking out the girls and having a great time until a strange woman comes into the Club with a bunch of ragged children.  ""These are your brothers"", she intones.

Who was that girl?

Freder then explores the inner city and is shocked by the working conditions.  He imagines the machine is a god and that the workers are slaves, sacrificing their bodies and flesh to the maw that is The Machine.

Clearly the director is making a statement about where the Industrial Age is heading.

But then we get to the Inventor, his plan within a plan.  We discover Maria, a passionate woman who says that the workers (Hands) and the management (Brain) have no way to communicate.  They need a ""mediator"".  A Heart.  And she falls in love with that Heart.

Amazing tale, insightful, and at times  unintentionally funny -- the scenes with the humanoid made flesh to look like Maria dancing at a club with ""the upper ten thousand"" is very humorous -- the prancing, the staring and ogling -- just too much.

Highly recommended!  Do get the new release from Kino Video as soon as they release it!

Quotable Quotes from Metropolis!

*  Freder: It was their hands that built this city of ours, Father. But where do the hands belong in your scheme?
Joh Frederson: In their proper place, the depths.

*  Maria: There can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator.

*  Maria: ""We shall build a tower that will reach to the stars!"" Having conceived Babel, yet unable to build it themselves, they had thousands to build it for them. But those who toiled knew nothing of the dreams of those who planned. And the minds that planned the Tower of Babel cared nothing for the workers who built it. The hymns of praise of the few became the curses of the many - BABEL! BABEL! BABEL! - Between the mind that plans and the hands that build there must be a Mediator, and this must be the heart.

It's a very symbolic silent film that is so applicable to today - the ""haves"" and ""have nots,"" the working man, the corporate bosses, and so on.  I saw a version of Metropolis on cable (USA) and that version was supposed to have the original orchestral score with it.  It makes a world of difference in watching it.  I've looked long and hard to find this version because other versions had the wrong music - some about listening to ""happy, cheerful"" music and watching a serious scene just doesn't cut it - or was just a poor quality.  The Kino restoration has the original score.  The effects used were pretty good considering the time.  Sure it's not CGI, but I'm not sure CGI would have the same impact if it was used.  The latest restoration will not be available until later this year and, yes, I will be getting that version.  That version is being show around the country now.

One of the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time! Fritz Lang created a expressionist piece of cinema with this Silent Sci-fi/fantasy epic. The story is quite good if a bit weak and the performances are nice but what makes this special is that it gave us a visually stunning view of the future with it's brilliant stunning visuals and some great stop motion camera trickery all covered in this futuristic dystopian love story as it offers philisophical and religious ideas all presented well. The film has been cut and has been lost sometimes in the wake over the years until a so-called restored version in 2002 came all from the public domain shortened versions but now it's been announced the 154 minute version has been discovered in Argentina as it will be come back to the US on DVD/Blu-Ray and brief theatrical release as it's the final cut that fans have been waiting for a long time.

955474,4,6305013578,"One of the biggest announcements in cinema in 2008 was the discovering of a 16mm reduction of the original cut of Fritz Lang's 1927 classic/sci-fi silent film ""Metropolis"".  The 2001 restoration gave us the best representation of this classic film which has been shown in so many cuts and variations since its release back in 1927.

But the DVD release in 2002 featured the 124 minute cut of the film and was the best version out there for the film.  That was until July 2008 and the 16mm film found in Argentina was located which contained over 210 minutes.  Spearheaded by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, since Feb. 2010, the restored film is currently making its rounds around the world and being screened. For those not familiar with ""Metropolis"", the version that we have seen recently features missing footage but the footage is told by a black screen with text, to give us information of what has happened during parts of the film.

Granted, the explanations were enough to watch this fantastic silent film but one could imagine how much footage one had missed.  And now knowing that we have seen 124 minutes and the 16-mm found is over 210 minutes.  That is a substantial amount of footage missing.  With that being said, if I am able to catch a screening of this fantastic film, I needed to watch the previous 2001 restoration once more.

And after the film has made its run, KINO Video has announced that will be releasing a Blu-ray version of the film which I definitely look forward to.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Metropolis"" is a film that is available in so many formats especially in public domain.  But this 2001 authorized restored version was the best looking version of the film in the last decade until the new restored footage was found.  But a lot of time has gone into cleaning up the film and restoring it.

The film looks absolutely beautiful and one can't help but be in awe of the special effects and how futuristic ""Metropolis"" looked, how clear the picture quality this film looks considering it being a nearly 80+ year-old film.  From the special effects to the costume design especially during Freder's dream of the sacrificial deity to the dream of death and then seeing this metropolis with vehicles and planes circling around the city.  It's just an amazing sight of what was created during that time period before computers and CG.

The film is featured in 1:33:1 black and white and is the best version.

AUDIO, SUBTITLES & INTERTITLES:

""Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition"" features music composed by Gottfried Huppertz presented in 5.1 Surround Sound.  The music works great with this film.  Intertitles are in English, while subtitles for the audio commentary and special features are in English, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by film historian Enno Patalas. Subtitles are in English, French and Spanish.  Enno Patalas is very knowledgeable about Fritz Lang's work and gives us detail on the film.
  * The Metropolis Case - (43:49) A 2002  documentary on the making of ""Metropolis"" by Enno Patalas.  Patalas goes into the making of the film, the architecture, special effects, and what took place after ""Metropolis"".
  * The Digital Restoration of ""Metropolis"" - (8:48) Martin Koerber goes into depth of the restoration of the film and side-by-side comparisons of the film and what was done in the restoration.  In German feat. English, Spanish and French subtitles.
  * Facts & Dates - Text based information on production of Metropolis.
  * Photo Galleries - Using your remote, viewers can cycle through images such as production stills, missing scenes, architectural sketches, posters and artwork.
  * Cast and Crew Biographies - Featuring 13 cast and crew biographies (text based) .

EXTRAS:

Included is an 8-page insert booklet on the restoration of Metropolis written by Martin Koerber (supervisor of the 75th Anniversary Restoration on behalf of the F.W. Murnau Foundation/Transit Films)

JUDGMENT CALL:

Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is just incredible.  What is amazing is that this 83-year old film has literally caught the attention of cinema fans because throughout the decades, there is always something new to find with this film because of the new footage and restoration that has been done to the film.  With this 2001 restored version, one would imagine that this was the best there would be of this film but sure enough, a new and longer version has been found, restored and is currently being shown in theaters.

But still despite the missing footage that many people have seen for many decades, these incomplete films still manage to be quite entertaining and literally put any viewer in awe of how stylish the film was, how ambitious Fritz Lang was when it came to the overall production design and most of all, the science fiction elements which may have not been appreciated when it was first released but ""Metropolis"" was way ahead of its time.

The film is literally dreamy and dark and just something that is hard to believe was created in 1927.  Could you imagine the vast miniature and large sets that were built to create the look and feel of this huge city where the management live and then this underground worker's city that seems dark and dismal.  With over 25,000 extras and such elaborate setups way before CGI and green screen, one can only be in awe of German Expressionism and Lang and Harbou at their very best.

And this film has had its share of dangers as children were in the middle of rising cold water, while actress Brigitte Helm during her robot lady scenes was put near hot flames.  We get the sense of dire straits and sure enough, Fritz Lang knew how to get the talent to react as if something terrible has happened.

When this KINO Video release of ""Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition"" was released, this DVD was the definitive version to own.  But yet, not Fritz Lang's complete version.  Even with the new footage circulating at the film festivals, because of degradation, we are still a bit away from having a 100% complete copy of ""Metropolis"" but we are getting close.  Especially with this highly anticipated Blu-ray release coming at the end of the year from KINO Video.

But for now, with so many public domain copies of the film out there, the ""Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition"" is the definitive version of the film to own for now.  Even though we are missing major chunks of the film, we learn from narratives of what happened during the scenes not present in the film (you can view a lot of these photos via stills included on this DVD).

The restoration done on the film is absolutely amazing and picture quality looks great and I love the musical, symphonic score for the film.  And also you get a pretty detail and in-depth commentary and documentary by Enno Patalas.  If you haven't watched ""Metropolis"" before, I definitely recommend watching this film.  It's a precursor to today's sci-fi films and its a film that continues to surprise people by it's look, its story and the superb acting.

""Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition"" is definitely recommended but for those who have a Blu-ray player, be patient as there will be a Blu-ray release of ""Metropolis"" to be released later this year.",1269907200,6,7362,4.896607431340873
955475,5,6305013578,"This review specifically refers to the kino version. The kino version is as true to the original as anyone could ask. Anyone that is critizing it for altering/falling short of the original is asking something impossible or does not understand what this version accomplishes.

First of all, the film is not tinted (that reviewer is not even reffering to this version). The restoration makes this 1927 film look very good. It is well known that there is much of the original film that is lost. All of the original film that could be used is used in the edition and where film is missing there is text to fill the viewer in on the missing plot. Also, the original score is indeed in synch with the film, and this is only made possible by these segments where time is elapsed and the plot is summarized with text.

I watched the film originally on a disc that came with a fifty dvd 'horror' collection that cost $20. This single movie is more expensive, yet the film is so moving and original, it is well worth the money. Take for example the scene where Freder shouts: 'Molloch.' It has been cited as inspiration for the use of Molloch in Allen Ginsberg's Poem Howl.

And this film is not just amazing considering the time it was made. True, there was nothing like it before, but there has been nothing like it since, which is exactly why I place it at the top of my list amongst my very favorite films. And Fritz Lang in general was an absolutely amazing film-maker. I wouldn't compare more than 3 or 4 film-makers in the history of film to him.",1269648000,,1543,4.445229681978798
955476,4,6305013578,"For what it is and when it was made, this is a forward-looking film that gives a simplistic but appealing message about treating workers fairly and not building empires on the backs and on the blood, tears, and sweat of others.  Obviously, many parts of the world are still not that progressive and probably never will be, human nature being what it is.

The idea of blending a robot with a human is also  fascinating and is explored to some degree here, both literally and metaphorically.

955537,5,6305013578,"10-19-2010 Update: I add this information solely for those who might not be up-to-date. The expanded version with the added 28 minutes will be released on dvd on 11-16-2010, in both a 2 disc set, and a blu-ray version.  Both of the new sets seem to contain the same extras: one 50 minute documentary on the making and restoration of the new version, and the other an interview with the curator of The Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, who was instrumental in bringing the expanded version to the light of day.

The blu-ray version has a lenticular (3D-like) cover.

Whether blu-ray will improve the film remains to be seen. My own experience has sometimes been that  the blu-ray effect essentially produces a grainier image on old films, which I don't consider an improvement. So I'll wait for some reviews to come in before I buy. But in any event, this is a must-have in one version or the other. (The new version will be shown on TCM in November by the way).

05-2010 UPDATE: I saw the new expanded Kino version yesterday here in New York at Film Forum. It includes the 20+ minutes of ""lost"" film found in Argentina last year. It clocks in at about 2:30+. The new segment quality is very poor (its in 16mm), but it does allow the story to make sense (well almost), and the score is fully integrated. So all the talk of the original being ""lost forever""  were a bit premature. And I bet that somewhere there is a complete 35mm print waiting to be discovered. (The 16mm print was in the hands of a private collector in Buenos Aires, so anything's possible !).

In any event, a blu-ray version is being released soon. So keep an eye out. This is an amazing film on many levels (and I generally don't like science fiction at all).

ps:  Three Cheers For Kino !

--------------
The NY Times reports an additional 20+ minutes of the original film has been discovered. Its 16mm, and has been integrated into the 32mm version now most generally available...the new version actually synchronizes with the original score ! (Google the story in the NY Times, week of 02-13-10)

Its been shown little so far in 2010, but I have no doubt it will receive dvd release after a brief  theatrical run (how many people have even heard of this film in this, the age of Avatar?).

In the meantime, I'd avoid all these lousy copies of a copy of an ""enhanced"" copy (who's doing these enhancements by the way? I have software on my computer that is supposed to enhance videos, but I'm not rushing out to hype my version of old public domain films).",1266451200,8,2525,4.49890590809628

Kino is, without a doubt the best edition out there.  I've seen a few others and was extremely dissapointed.  The problem is that lots of scenes from the original print have been lost.  Many editions have not tried to keep the original complex storyline intact and so the entire beauty of the movie has been lost (to say nothing of the bad orchestral accompaniments and bad print qualities to go around!).

Kino has a great soundtrack, wonderful print quality and is faithful to the original storyline.  so much so that when there is a missing scene, Kino puts up an intertitle to explain what was happening int he missing scene so that the original storyline still makes sense.

955543,5,6305013578,"I had never seen ""Metropolis"" before although I have seen many silent films. I looked around for what looked like the best version, the Kino had the best reviews and I think they did an amazing job, the film is very clear and the speed looks fine, this is particularly important for this film where the visual impact is overwhelming from the opening credits when a series of lines create the word Metropolis, and the viewer is directly confronted with the machine world, powerful and frightening, yet beautifully depicted.

The musical score is an additional plus. This edition has the original music by Gottfried Huppertz, which is effective and interesting music, and as excellent complement to the film as one could want.
The viewer should be aware that since this copy was made there have been several original films re-discovered: One at the Museum of Cinema in Buenos Aires, another in Chile and a third in New Zeland, so a full length version with all the missing scenes is to be expected in the near future.

When we see the main ""Heart machine"" through the protagonist's eyes, we perceive its inherent evil by its transformation into the monstruous ancient god Moloch, devouring in its furnace-mouth the worker-slaves. This vision sequence is one of the best in the film and one of the best in the history of cinema. The extremely complex process required for the subtle transformation is explained in the extra section of the DVD where there are a lot of other useful details on the costume designs, biography of the artists involved, making of the film and interviews with the director himself, many years later, all of which I also recommend watching to fully comprehend the film within the context of the period.

The story line is a typical love story:  Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich) is the son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Able), who rules over the great megacity of Metropolis. Freder, like all happy aristocrats in many ages,  is surprised to discover his lifestyle has been built on the backbreaking exploitation of a largely invisible working class (thankfully for the visuals, very attractive men make up most of the groupings)  who constantly tend to the machines that make the city work. He discovers the subterranean levels of Metropolis in an effort to understand these lives, but is driven to it by the infatuation with a mysterious and radiantly beautiful woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm) who makes an unexpected apparition at his Club (actually aptly named Club of the Sons, Eternal Gardens) surrounded by a group of the worker's children  while she is showing them the garden of the club.
Though the scene is cut short by the Master of Ceremonies of the club and his attendants who clearly find such an intrusion inappropriate-The closeups between Freder and Maria at this point are extraordinary in their expressivity, a whole passion is growing in seconds and the poetry of her perfectly lit face, particularly her eyes in this scene is a highlight of the film and reminiscent of the visual impact of a Garbo closeup. Interestingly while reading the notes, I found out that this great actress of the silent cinema retired only a few years later when she married a German industrialist, and in Pre-Garbo fashion never again appeared or discussed her life in films or interviews to the end of her very long life.

When Freder rushes to see his father we catch a glimpse of that great city, still imposing and futuristic today after so many hundreds of skyscrapers have been built, everywhere in the world. And for us that have lived here in New York for so long that the skyscraper skyline is the most familiar urban landscape, it is obvious that the inspiration for his gargantuan city came to Lang when he visited here in 1924. It is hard to understand from today's perspective, but when the movie was completed, and certainly at the time of that voyage,  neither the Chrysler (which particularly resembles the central tower of Metropolis) or the Empire Estate existed, they came years later in 1930-31, the Woolworth building in downtown Manhattan, which was completed in 1913 was the world's tallest structure till 40 Wall street was constructed, ahead of the Chrysler,  also in 1930. But since 1908 all the tallest structures of the world were located here, as one replaced the other through the years,  and the massive construction, particularly around the financial district, had already given New York a 'Babylonian' look as the city of towers reaching for the stars. In his uniquely perceptive and prophetic way, Lang was already dreaming up the city that developed in the future, but that would already be realized to architectonic perfection in his great film.

The hero's father is a powerful and detached executive, whose every facial expression beams out elegant self agrandizement, as well as the peculiarl expression that comes with absolute power, is worried by both Freder's unnatural interests and Maria's potentially subversive activities among the workers. He makes this discovery through the intelligence of evil scientist: Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge a great actor who portrays this villain to perfection within the contrast of Maria's purity and Freder's innocence.

Rotwang shows him the entire scene of Maria haranguing the workers from a tunnel in his house that is conveniently connected to the catacombs where they meet. She is telling them the story of the Tower of Babel, another sequence of film that is absolutely riveting in its recreation and manipulation of the huge crowds in the construction, who resemble in their enslavement, the citizens of Metropolis and is actually an allegory for their  coming rebellion. More importantly, she is prophesying to them of a ""Mediator"" who will come to ""make things better"" . Rotwang actually hates Joh Fredersen because he took away his love, an idealized beauty named Hel that appears in the scene in the shape of a marble bust, uncanningly similar to Maria in looks. Fredersen married Hel, but she died giving birth to the young Fredersen. He  also has created a robot, an extraordinary creation that can be 'better than man' and he agrees to give it the likeness of Maria in order to destroy both Freder's love for the girl and her own revolutionary activities. But Rotwang has a hidden plan of his own: once the Maria-robot has been unleashed, he will use her to destroy Metropolis and thereby take revenge on Joh Fredersen, though things do not turn out quite as he expects, of course. The transformation sequence of the robot however,  is one of the most successful and visually fascinating parts in the movie, and marks it as one of the all time masterpieces of science fiction.

The movie is not only high art and entertaining, but it manages to retain a level of modernity and relevance to contemporary social issues that is still, today, almost a century after its creation, simply baffling. There is a lot here that reminds the viewer of an earlier masterpiece by an American genius of the cinema, Griffith's ""Intolerance"". It is certainly on the same level of importance and quality as one of the best films ever made.

The missing parts of the movie are explained with titles, and they basically relate to subplots, so I am relieved to think the most important and relevant part of the film is what has survived, though any cut it is to be regretted, given the high quality of the design, scenery and costumes of this movie, which are always perfect. However only last year(2008) a copy of the original film  was discovered at the Cinema Museum in Buenos Aires and is currently being restored by the rights holders of Metropolis, the F.W. Murnau Stiftung, which later confirmed that the newly discovered footage largely completes the missing footage, except for a single scene which was badly damaged due to being at a reel end. Although the new footage is reported to be in a ""deplorable"" condition they had begun restoration work on the rediscovered film this year and a new restored copy is to be expected in the near future, I for one  can not wait to see it, though I consider this existing version enough of a masterpiece to be viewed over and over again.",1246924800,4,8175,4.893063583815029

955603,5,6305013578,"As one of the earliest examples of cinematic science fiction and fantasy, ""Destiny"" director Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" ranks as an unparalleled achievement in its size, scope, and vision. Forty years would elapse before Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) would rival Lang's epic spectacle about a troubled, dystopian society fractured along the fault lines of the economic inequality that isolated the haves and the have-nots. Nevertheless, nothing could ever be said to surpass ""Metropolis"" as a film of scale, special effects, and surrealism. According to Frank Miller at the Turner Classic Movies Website in his Overview Article about ""Metropolis, ""Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou were influenced by several writers: ""They drew ideas from a variety of sources, including Karel Capek's play about a robot revolt, R.U.R.; the pioneering Soviet science fiction film Aelita (1924); and H.G. Wells' novels."" Miller describes ""Metropolis"" as ""the most influential science fiction film of all time."" Nevertheless, moviegoers should keep in mind that ""Metropolis"" was not the first science fiction film. George Melies short film ""A Trip to the Moon"" aka ""Le voyage dans la lune"" (1903) and the Soviet film ""Aelita"" (1924) preceded ""Metropolis.""

""Metropolis"" inspired generations of filmmakers with its use of state-of-the-art visual effects that transformed the science fiction film.  Thea Von Harbou's saga about an evil robot  designed by a vengeful inventor to impersonate a flesh & blood female Christ figure and incite anarchy can clearly be traced as a source of inspiration to many contemporary sci-fi films and television shows, such as the ""Terminator"" franchise, ""Robocop"" franchise, ""Blade Runner,"" ""Logan's Run,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" and Battlestar Galactica.""  The ""Metropolis"" robot was not the first robot, but it was unmistakably the seminal one that sired a long line of cinematic robots.  The famous transformation scene where the robot turns into a human foreshadows the ""Frankenstein"" franchise.
Many detractors of Lang's visionary work--primarily noted sci-fi author H.G. Wells--derided it as shallow and his criticisms are not without substance.  Indeed, the characters lack depth because they represent archetypes instead of individuals in a larger-than-life story.  The spectacle, this Marxist chronicle of humanity at odds with itself over machinery, and the anarchy that emerges from this division makes ""Metropolis"" a memorable meditation about our flawed society, part sci-fi, part horror and a statement about the incompatibility polarity that comes about between those who control and those who are controlled.  Again, von Harbou's theme re-echoes with greater intensity.  The virtuous Maria would say that the head and the hands would need a mediator and the mediator would be the heart.  You cannot understand and appreciate science fiction as a cinematic genre until you see that every sci-fi film owes a debt of gratitude to Lang's masterly work of genius.  Actually, while Lang would make many greatmovies in a long career, the legendary Austrian director never made another sci-fi film that surpassed this milestone.

A malevolent robot, messianic crusaders, a patriarchal titan of industry, a mad scientist with vengeance in his heart, and masses of mindless men and women enslaved by the patriarch constitute the array of characters in this famous work of German Expressionist cinema, and embraces Art-Deco in its architectural designs.  Scenarist Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang assembled these protagonists and antagonists for the clash of the century with visuals that were designed to  overwhelm 1920's audiences by their sheer beauty and grandeur.  In the annals of science fiction film, these special effects, involving the use of mirrors to supplement shots of live action, matte paintings for sprawling cityscapes, and miniatures of the city, were singular.  All the planes, trains, and automobiles in the long shots were done either with wires pulling them along or stop-action photography.  Reportedly, Lang got the idea for his cityscape from a trip to Manhattan, but there are too many undocumented stories about Lang and his inspiration; so you'd have to read the biographies available about his life to sort out the fiction from the fact.  One thing is certain Lang was more a film dictator than a director and he toiled endlessly and made his cast and collaborators toil to forge his vision.  Lang drove his actors, actresses, and technical crew like a slave driver and often exhibited a sense of perfectionism that defied civility and common sense.  He amounted to a cinematic Herod.

While ""Metropolis"" qualifies as sci-fi, the film also dabbles in the disaster film.  The villainous father of the hero, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), enlists the evil inventor, C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), to create a robot look-alike of the virginal heroine, Marie, who preaches a gospel of sorts to unit the workers.  Rotwang dresses in dark colors, has wind-blown hair, and wears a black glove on his right hand.  Fredersen wants Rotwang to forge a robot that can assume the identity of Marie (Brigitte Helm), mislead the masses, and get them to destroy themselves.  Joh has obtained secret plans for meetings among the workers and wants to thwart them.  Rotwang escorts Joh down into the 2000 year old catacombs to witness Marie preaching her gospel of unification and that is where Joh sees his son Freder (Gustav Frhlich) appear and embrace Marie.

Previously, Freder was smitten with Marie when he saw her first early in the film.  She entered the Club of Sons where Freder cavorted with various women.  Freder was so stricken by Marie that he descended to the depths where the workers operated the machines and witnessed a meltdown.  Joh is worried about his son's dalliance with the workers because it threatens to destroy everything that he has worked for for so many years.  In fact, Joh fires his secretary Josaphat (Theodor Loos) because Josaphat didn't inform him about the incident with the machines.  Joh replaces Josaphat with the Thin Man (Franz Rasp) and orders him to keep him constantly abreast of his son's whereabouts.  Eventually, the false Marie does mislead the workers into destroying the Heart Machine and the loss of power leads to a flood that wipes out their homes.  Grot, the foreman in charge of the machines, warns Joh, but he orders Grot to open the gates so that the workers can destroy the Heart Machine.  The evil Marie leads the men and women workers alike to the machine hall, but she slips out a back exit while they destroy the machines.  What the workers fail to realize is that the destruction of the Heart machine will destroy their own homes.

Meanwhile, Freder and the real Marie rescue the children below as the flood waters rise from an underground river that Joh had constructed.  They use the air shafts to escape from the depth and take the children to the Club of the Sons above the earth.  At the same time, Grot alerts the workers about the dangers of what they have done and how it will jeopardize their children.  The furious workers now want to kill Marie.  The evil Marie has gone to a nightclub where she is celebrating her masquerade over the workers.  The nightclub revelers leave the club with Marie on their shoulders and go out into the night air.  The virtuous Marie has gotten separated from Freder and the children and is now being pursued by the mob of angry workers.  She runs into the revelers and wicked Marie and the mob grabs the evil Marie.  They tie her to a stake and set fire to her.  Rotwang captures the real Marie and takes her to the top of the cathedral.  Freder spots Rotwang with Marie over his shoulder and sets off in rapid pursuit.  They fight on the roof-top and Rotwang plunges to his death below.  In the last scene, the virtuous Marie calls on Freder to serve as the mediator between his father and Grot, the worker's representative, to work together.

""Metropolis"" dealth with one of Lang's recurrent themes--mob violence.  Later, he explored this theme in ""M"" (1931) with Peter Lorre and ""Fury"" (1936) with Spencer Tracy.  Although ""Metropolis"" has been available as a cheap, inexpensive public domain film for over 40 years, Kino Video has released a splendid restored version that true movie lovers will genuinely appreciate for its clarity of picture.

  Yes, this is a silent movie, made in 1927, but this doesn't subtract from the mood or the message of the movie.  Also, the special effects for this movie was WAY before it's time.

When a mad scientist develops a way of building robots who could replace the workers, one of the world's controllers kidnaps the workers' leader, Maria, a kindly woman who preaches peace, and replaces her with a robot Maria, who incites the workers to violent acts which will justify their murder.

For a silent movie made in 1927, ""Metropolis"" is incredible. The plot is highly detailed (as detailed as a novel), and in the same vein as dystopian classics such as ""Brave New World"" and ""1984"". Anyone who liked either of these novels will certainly like ""Metropolis"". Although at times a bit slow moving, the film is nonetheless fascinating enough to hold your interest even through these scenes. For the time, the special effects are very impressive, and the film is not as severely plagued by over-acting as many other silent movies (such as ""Nosferatu"") are.

The best thing about this film is the aspects of the plot involving the robot Maria. Brigitte Helm who plays Maria is incredibly convincing in this dual role. She makes it believe that there exist two different people who look exactly the same - the robot and the human, although, Helm particularly excels when playing the robot. The character of robot Maria is so entertaining to watch and so different from anything I have ever seen that I am surprised that ""Metropolis"" has not been remade.

If ""Metropolis"" were made today, I am certain that it would be a runaway success among science-fiction fans. As it is, there has been no remake, but don't let the fact that this is a silent movie put you off. There are good reasons why ""Metropolis"" is considered a classic and it should still be enjoyable for modern audiences.",1231718400,2,1849,4.771875
955612,5,6305013578,"I have never seen Metropolis before but this genre of old classic films really intrigue me especially the silent films.  I saw all the reviews of Metropolis and figured it might be worth a see.  This company Kino always deliveries quality in their movies and as I watched this one I was happy to see a nice picture without a bunch of distortion or fuzz.  The audio is 5.1 surround sound and it sounds great.  The music is very good and it really captures the mood of whats going on.

I don't know what the original was like but I am very happy with what I saw and heard.  Like I said this is my 1st time seeing this so I don't know whats missing or what versions are available or whatever.  Most movies from the silent era never really grab me as much as this film did.  What is going on onscreen really captivated me and I was amazed at the time it came out and what it had accomplished.  For being such an old movie it was still enjoyable for me to watch today so I know it will be a classic favorite in my collection.  The subtitles when active give a somewhat glimpse of whats trying to be conveyed and some stuff I would never of thought of like seeing doors shut behind people as a relevance to something.  The subtitles are very helpful if you have no idea of what you are watching or even if you do the insights are still a very nice extra.

Though the special features are a little light it does give a little insight into the restoring process.  There is also a documentary that goes into the German film industry at that time and scenes that were left out.  These extra features though kind of short but still were interesting to watch.

Odds are if you don't like silent films or films that require a open mind to whats going on or even a respect for the time period you probably won't like it at all.  There is a lot of weird imagery going on so you kind of have to think sometimes about what is happening and if it has some other meaning.  I found the subtitles to help in this regard.  Overall I know some people would not have patience for a silent movie nor care for them but I have a great respect for older films and when I find one that I enjoy I know its worth my five star rating.

Hands down.  This restoration rendered the print so clean, and the movement so smooth, it looked almost as good as if it had been made yesterday.  It's as restored to its original construction as well as it can be accomplished at this time, with intertitles to explain the missing elements that have so far remained lost.  This is a finely produced disc, rewarding on a couple of levels.  For one, it satisfies the wish to see the film in as close to its pristine condition as possible.  I wasn't there for the premiere, of course, so I can't say how exact it is, but it seems remarkable to me, as I imagine it might have appeared when it was new.

For another, the extra features provide quite an education on the film itself.  The first is a documentary titled ""The Metropolis Case.""  Running just under 44 minutes, it traces the cultural and historical influences explicit in the film, the people involved and their relationships, the set design, the cost, and so on, and how it fell into the edited mess it eventually became.  A second much shorter documentary (about nine minutes) details the restoration process.  It's interesting and very informative, instilling an appreciation for people who dedicate themselves to such tasks.  To demonstrate the result, several scenes from the film are divided down the middle, for a left-right, before-and-after comparison, where the improvement is striking.  In an exemplary case of the dedication to the project, when a scene involving a special effect was irrecoverably ruined, the archivists located the preserved original elements of the effect, then further restored and reassembled them.  Jumps from splicing, caused from slipping in the copying machine, were corrected, so in at least that regard, it's improved over how it would have looked at the initial screening.  The end result of the restoration was so successful, it was admitted by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) into the Memory of the World Register.

This edition includes an audio commentary by film historian Enno Patalas.  Patalas approached the task like a film scholar, and therefore omits the casual tone present in most commentary tracks.  He draws attention to the themes, how Lang and his crew provided this or that to hit the mark.  For what you get out of this disc, it's worth every last penny, and then some.

The last example of German Expressionism, and the first in the style of New-Objectivity, the milestone sci-fi film ""Metropolis"" was not treated with much respect upon its initial release.  It was immediately edited to achieve a more commercially viable shorter length, and all that survives of the original 1927 film is an incomplete and partly damaged camera negative, and the shortened and re-edited release prints.  It's been in the public domain for years, and therein lies the problem in finding a good copy.  The public domain copies are all incomplete versions in which subplots were removed and motivations are sometimes left unclear.  A lot of times what you'll end up with is a copy of a copy, some from early video tapes, several generations removed for the original negative, and of course the further you get, the murkier the image gets.  Because anyone can download it from a place like Internet Archive and sell it, there are always several crude copies floating about.  In the past, I bought two of them, before I understood what was going on.  Fortunately neither of them cost nearly as much as this Triad edition.  Regardless of whatever process the claim ""enhanced"" includes, no real improvements can be made unless you can get your hands on an actual negative.  Triad does not have access to one, so what you'll get is just one more messy public domain copy.  And NO public domain copies are complete.  That's a fact.  So, from experience, I can pass along this information.

I bought this back in 2003, when it was newly released, and was very impressed by the exactness applied to the research and restoration. Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but it's worth every penny of it. The Murnau Foundation searched all over the world for all the best possible negatives, selected the best elements from each, went back to the original script and reassembled the elements accordingly, filled in the missing segments with title cards, and did an incredible frame-by-frame restoration. I learned all of this from the two very detailed documentaries, one exclusively on the painstaking restoration. Along with that you get a commentary track, production stills, on and on. It's chockfull of extras. The restoration was so successful, the film looked nearly like a modern release, and that's not just hyperbole. It's truly a remarkable accomplishment.

955659,4,6305013578,"This is a German-Canadian production, and I believe that the German subtitle means ""Power of the City"".  ""Metropolis"" is another series which combines computer graphics, live actors and sets, and interviews with historians and archeologists to give a picture of life in cities of the classical age.  Similar series are ""Engineering an Empire"", ""Secrets of Archeology"", and ""Ancient Discoveries"".  Each of these series takes a slightly different approach, and each has its strengths and weaknesses.

Compared to other series, ""Metropolis"" is focused on how these cities operated: what were the markets like, how were the streets laid out, how were basic services like sewer and water provided, how were they policed, etc.  While the approach is not exactly ""what was daily life like"", the series does try to show something about the culture, and sometimes the art and architecture, of the cities.  These episodes are very well written and do a good job of explaining what we know from archeology and history.  Sometimes this is a limitation, however.  For example, the section on Alexandria has a good deal about plumbing, which is what is left from classical Alexandria, everything else having been built over.  As the narration says, the city must have had magnificent buildings, but we have no idea what they looked like.  Personally, I would have much preferred that they showed their best guesses.

One of the strengths of ""Metropolis"" is its superior computer graphics.  However, there is usually no more than a few minutes of this in each hour long episode.  I would have preferred more, and accordingly lowered my rating of this series.

Disc 1 contains episodes on four classical Mediterraen cities: Athens, Rome, Carthage, and Alexandria.  For the cities of Athens and Rome, for which there is a great deal of information, in addition to the standard material you would expect, the series looks at some aspects which are not frequently covered (policing, unusal public building, etc.).  Not as much is known about Carthage and Alexandria and these episodes are more traditional.  As I mentioned above, I was disappointed in the Alexandria episode; even though it includes something about the famous library I do not feel this series did the library justice (the best treatment of the Alexandrian library I know of is in ""Ancient Discoveries"").

Disc 2 covers three medieval cities: Constantinople, Venice, and Paris.  The Constantiople and Venice episodes are excellent, and the Constantiople episode is by far the best that I have seen on that city.  One of the techniques of the series is to tell a story set in the time period covered for each city.  Of course this is to help us get a sense of what life and culture was like then.  The story included for medieval Paris was that of Francois Villon.  While this is a fascinating story, I felt that the episode spent too much time on it, so that the episode became more about Villon that Paris.",1216684800,9,2955,4.973523421588594
955660,4,6305013578,"Kino's Restored Authorized Edition of Metropolis is undoubtedly the most superb restoration of a film ever executed.  However, as of July 1st, 2008, this is no longer the most complete version of the film available.  Metropolis was originally a 130 minute film which was mercilessly chopped down to an overly simplified 80 minutes.  Archivists across Europe worked tirelessly to restore Metropolis to the best of their ability, producing this 124 minute version as a result -- the longest version of Metropolis to date, containing scenes and subplots that don't appear in any other version.

However, it's now been twice verified that a complete 130 minute version of the film (which wasn't supposed to exist) has been discovered in Buenos Aires and is the real thing.  This Holy Grail of classic film is in poor condition and will, no doubt, take time to restore, but you can bet that restoration will begin immediately.

955661,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang created a utopia in which he did not believe. He ended his masterpiece film with a message which he thought hopeless in real society. Over thirty years after the film's completion, he stated in an interview how he envisioned Metropolis: ""You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hands and the brain is the heart - I mean that's a fairy tale - definitely. But I was very interested in machines."" Deeper meaning must lie beneath the surface of this quote, influenced no doubt by the turbulent social, political, and economic climates present in Weimar Germany at the time the film was made. It is impossible to believe that Metropolis was simply a project made by a hobbyist, signifying nothing - which is what a face-value interpretation of this statement would conjure. Lang was making an idealistic statement film - a message to the squabbling masses of how they should act rather than how they are acting. The art, politics, and economic status of German society all played a roll in influencing Metropolis.

Art

World War I marked the end to the first phase of expressionism typified by art groups Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter, and heralded in the comparatively new medium of film as an art form. Major players in the world film scene were beginning to appear in the wartime years of 1914-1918, not the least of which was Hollywood in 1914. Until then, studios had relatively little control over the motion picture industry, films instead being produced by independent artists with limited funds. During wartime, the power of the studio system grew rapidly as film began to take a firm hold on the world as a legitimate form of entertainment. Out of these burgeoning enterprises, the German studio UFA, Universum Film AG, would rise to prominence after its inception in 1917. With the end of the war and the adoption of the Weimar Republic, German artists were once again able to focus attention to their trade. German expressionist painters who were interrupted by the war came back to a world changed by technology. They quickly embraced the medium of film for their own, employing UFA as their main base of operations. Expressionist painting was still fashionable, but the style was giving way to the newer trend of Dadaism, the so-called ""anti-art."" Film, however, was wide open. As an art form, film had not been explored by neither America nor Germany. Used mainly for escapist entertainment or newsreels, the moving image had hitherto not been used to express the deep emotions and subconscious layers of the human psyche as the canvas had. The Expressionists changed this. In 1919, Robert Wiene created Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari, which was more of a moving painting than anything that had come before. The Expressionists had created the world's first art film.
Lang's inspiration has roots in numerous historic events of the time period, as well as social changes and art forms - especially German Expressionism. Indeed, Metropolis is often considered the last silent German Expressionist film; ending a legacy which began with Caligari, and continued on through Nosferatu: Ein Symphonie Des Grauens, Der Mude Tod, Mabuse Der Spieler, Faust, Der Golem, The Hands of Orlac, and Die Strasse, among many others. The art form would continue into the sound era with films like M (1931) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933), both by Lang. Its influence would spread to present day American cinema as well, with clear examples in the stark contrast and expressive lighting of noir and neo-noir films like The Big Sleep (1946) and Sin City (2005), the surreal angles and set design of Night of the Hunter (1955), the dark and brooding plot of Blue Velvet (1986), or the expressive colors and sets of A Clockwork Orange (1971). Metropolis might have been the last great silent German Expressionist film, but it was certainly not the last expressionist film. The elements of Expressionism, which focus on heavy symbolism, abstraction, and the search for a deeper meaning to situations, played a role in Lang's choices as the director of Metropolis. Subtlety was difficult to convey on the silent screen, so to create an effective message film, the director would have to employ some very unsubtle tactics. As an art form, Expressionism is about as unsubtle as possible. Examples of this are the architecture of the city, with laser-like highways streaking across the screen, channeling the Rayonist movement which influenced Expressionist painting, the jagged crosses in the catacombs chapel, and Rotwang's house, which looks like a building straight out of Caligari. Babel reaches into the sky as the tallest object in sight. Even the name is expressive, referencing the biblical parable, and as a result being the embodiment of man's triumph over God. The biblical Babel was destroyed. Lang's is successfully completed - the tallest thing in the city. As far as the technical prowess of the film is concerned, Lang's passion for the project is indicated in the meticulous execution of his special effects and sets. Everything runs smoothly, and considering Metropolis was made in an era which predated most of the special effects techniques we know today, it is one of the most impressive films ever made; on par in terms of technical innovation with some of the greatest films in history, perhaps even Citizen Kane (a film also no-doubt influenced by Expressionism).
The story, too, is highly rooted in expressionist philosophy. The idea of utopia was a staple in the dialogue of Die Brucke, the pioneering art group headed by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and generally considered the beginning of German Expressionism proper. The expressionist philosophy which embraced war in order to bring mankind closer to this ideal utopia is also explored. Metropolis is plunged into chaos when the working class rebels and wreaks havoc on the city, and only then do the people realize the key to unity: a mediator between the two classes. From chaos came order. This is what the painters of Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter hoped would result from World War I, and this is the premise behind the conflict in Metropolis. When Lang professed his disbelief in the film's message in his 1960s interview, it was after the message of Metropolis had been completely disproven. Not only did World War I not create the utopia the expressionists had hoped for, it had made the world far worse. World Was II was the wake-up call for Lang. With over 50 million killed, the war sent as strong a counter message as possible. There could be no mediator; if two groups hate each other enough, there is no force in the world which can stop them from killing each other if that's what they decide they want. Naturally, after witnessing such destruction, Lang would pass the plot of Metropolis off as a fairy tale. Seen through modern eyes, the film does seem overly optimistic for the future of mankind, but professes a future that is highly unlikely. If Lang meant in his quote that he felt this way at the time he made Metropolis, he was lying. At the time, he was as firmly rooted in the fundaments of expressionist thought as Kirchner was.

History

 Glorious at the time, tragic in retrospect, the years of 1926 through 1928 saw a dramatic upturn in the German economy - although this resurgence would be short lived. After the crushing inflation of 1924, where a loaf of bread cost as much as one billion marks, the economy began to heal. Optimism was in the air and the dark, morbid atmosphere of Expressionist films of the early decade (Nosferatu, Der Mude Tod, Der Strasse, etc...) changed to decidedly lighter tones. Metropolis was one of several films that shared this feeling of hope. UFA switched focus from horror to epic films, of which Metropolis is more closely akin. Films like Niebelungen and Faust were adaptations of classic literature. It seemed that this new sense of idealism was the death of expressionism as the Germans knew it. Metropolis is a tale of idealism at its most dramatic. Although there is discontent within the working class, the concept of a mediator presents a solution so simple it seems absurd in the light of feasible socioeconomic reality. The middle classes seem content, although the film gives them little notice. The upper classes occupy the Tower of Babel, and are never portrayed, with the exception of the main character Freder, as being unhappy. The plot is an unrealistic account of the maintenance of a utopia. As Lang said, it is a fairy tale. But in the relieved haze of post-inflation Germany, Metropolis seemed like a celebration of ingenuity and German strength. After all, UFA could afford to make the film, reputed to be one of the most expensive silent films ever made. Little did the people know that 1929 would provide yet another disaster - one which would make the inflation of 1924 pale in comparison. The Great Depression ruined Weimar Germany and paved the way for the Nazi takeover. Metropolis, being made three years before the crash, seemed blissfully ignorant. There is no better evidence for this than the message plastered on the promotional posters for the film, which stated, ""Metropolis, the city of the future, is the city of eternal peace - the city of cities in which there is no animosity, no hatred, but only love and understanding.""
 Another strong influence on Metropolis was the contemporary political climate in Germany. The film portrays two social classes, upper and working, who coexist. Each is shown as necessary for the other's survival. The upper class (brain) controls the actions and organization of the working class (hands). Without the brain, the hands are unorganized and chaotic, as evidenced in their climactic riot. The working class in turn keeps the city from shutting down completely. This is evidenced when they destroy the Heart Machine and the power goes out. But these two groups also serve another purpose: they are both allegories for the various political parties in Germany. Near the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic had been overwhelmed with several political parties. The SPD (Socializimus Partei Deutschland), the KPD (Kommunizimus Partei Deutschland), and the NSDAP (Nationalsozializimus Deutscher Arbeiter Partei [Nazi Party]), were three among tens if not hundreds of parties warring for power over parliament. The communists are represented here by the working class, who live communally underground. The upper class were synonymous with the Weimar government: the socialist party. Left out was the middle class. In a case of life imitating art, this is what happened in Weimar society as well, at least with the petty bourgeois, who were the main constituents of the Nazi Party. Like in Metropolis, the dramatic polarities between the upper and lower classes provided enough of a distraction for the middle class to go relatively unnoticed. However, the situation in real life allowed the Nazis to come to power through gradual infiltration into the parliament. It would not be until the Great Depression, Hitler's dream come true, that the party would truly break through as the leader. But at the time Metropolis was made, the Nazis were going by relatively unnoticed. They were not nearly as strong as the ruling Socialist Party nor did they have the manpower of the communist party. In an ironic twist of fate the Nazi rule was consummated on the eve of an international disaster - something the early Expressionists philosophized as one of the instrumental steps toward utopia. Instead of a war, it was the great depression which launched Hitler's utopia - something drastically different from the one portrayed in Metropolis. The idea of a mediator is the only allegory for the middle class in Metropolis, and only appears at the end of the film. As was the case in real life, the mediator prevailed over both upper and lower, and took the form of national socialism. This is one reason why Lang believed that the moral behind the film was not realistic. A middle class was capable of keeping the upper and middle classes running synonymously, but this certainly did not produce utopia.

 Metropolis was an allegory for where Weimar Germany thought it could go. Envisioned as an idealistic portrait of future society, it turned out to be, as Lang called it thirty years later, a fairy tale. But while unrealistic, it remains one of the most important films in history for its technical prowess and its sheer scale. We remain hopeful even to this day that we may one day live in a city like the one portrayed in the film, but just as much as it was in 1927, this dream seems unreachable. There will always be conflict, whether a mediator is present or not. The ultimate proof of this is in our own minds. The id and superego cannot function without the ego, the mediator, but we as humans are still fundamentally flawed. We would never allow something as tranquil as a culture devoid of animosity. Our naturalistic instinct toward anger is the biggest reason why utopia would never work. We will not evolve into a race without anger because it is the aggressive who prevail in the world, and the process of natural selection will chose those who exude it. The world will keep getting worse, and there will never be a utopia.",1212624000,,13304,4.938811969629299

BEWARE SPOILERS

Fritz Lang's futuristic Metropolis is set in as it happens something like the current era.  Most of the population are workers who slave underground to keep the massive machine that is the city going while the privileged stay above ground and live hedonistic lives.  It is impossible not to see this in Marxian terms, the prols exploited by the capitalist class.  At the time of the film's production in Germany, there was indeed a specter haunting Europe and it was indeed the specter of communism.  Curiously Lang ends the film with a blatant political statement.  He has labor and capital reluctantly shake hands.  I find this curious because there is little doubt that for the previous two and a half hours the film depicts the capitalist class in the person of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) as seeing the workers as mere automations to be exploited.  I think Lang wanted to dodge the political implications of his film.  I think he was less interested in ideology than in showing striking visuals of man in the world of machines, of humans as machines themselves, and other humans more like brains without bodies, wet wear blind to anything but production and keeping the hive buzzing.

Metropolis is like a hive or an ant colony except that the workers never get to go out and forage.  Their world is dark and steamy; they are for the most part without hope as they come and go with their heads bowed in submission.

In another sense (and this metaphor is directly from the film) the workers are the hands of the body and the capitalists the mind.  Maria says, ""Between the mind that plans and the hands that build there must be a Mediator, and this must be the heart.""  Maria is a prophet who predicts the coming of this Mediator, who one might, in all innocence, believe to be a nice stand-in for, say, Jesus Christ.  Politically speaking, then, perhaps what Lang is saying is that the war between communism and capitalism will eventually be mediated by the Second Coming.  Expressing this commonplace idea with striking visuals rather than speaking it in so many words, exemplified the power of the relatively new medium of the ""picture show.""

This is the first silent film I've seen in many years.  It's a bit over the top in terms of acting, which of course was deliberate since facial expressions and body language were used to replace words that would have to be read.  Modern audiences may find this convention comical or just weird.  I found the scenes showing the characters running at something like one and a half times real human speed a bit amusing.  I don't know enough about silent films to know whether that was deliberate or something Lang thought effective.  Gustav Frohlich, who has the male lead, in particular is a frenzy of action and contorted facial expressions.  Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and her deadly clone (and the robot and the dancing woman as well) is even more over the top in her physical gyrations, but her performance stands out because there is nothing quite like it in filmdom, at least nothing that I have ever seen.  It is both the heavy makeup and her wild, demonic (and seductive) expressions that allow us to clearly see when she is the evil clone and not the demur, heroic Maria.  For me she was the most memorable part of the film.

There is quite a bit of trivia and film history associated with this landmark film.  The film seen today is a 2001 reconstruction of the original, part of which has been lost.  The missing action is explained in text before going on to the next scene.  Metropolis was said to be Hitler's favorite film, which doesn't surprise me, and it was the most expensive film made up until that time, and employed a huge cast.

It enjoys a special place among my silent collection, alongside ""Wings"" and ""Sunrise"" as well as ""Battleship Potemkin"" and the Garbo silent ""Flesh and the Devil"".

The film has been reviewed by so many here, that a blow-by-blow is unnecessary, in my opinion. Suffice to say that any restoration will inevitably improve upon the technology used in 1926. Purists will be pleased with the score, being fit for a film of this type, and the ""cuts"" made by American studios have been mostly restored. The uneven timing (caused by hand cranking of the camera) has been corrected, and the picture, itself is of a higher quality than the early VHS prints.

At this point, I would like to say that the Moroder version is still the standard for this film. Yes, it is shorter, as Moroder could not find every cut that was lost, and inserted stills to ""flesh out"" the missing segments. He also colorized it, and the score is unusual for a silent film, being made up of modern rock music. Strangely, IT WORKS, and very effectively, I might add!

The orchestral soundrack by the composer sizzles. There is a motif which is played for every character and mood of every imortant character. There is a theme music for the underground workers, one for the M machine, a theme for Joh Federson, for the heroine, one for the vamp etc. The story is about the the poor people who work in an underground city to keep all the machines running with their sweat and blood for wages so that the rich guys staying over the ground can have their systems working properly. It looks like the people underground keep the machines running which are necessary for electricity and other important characteristics of the rich people's world. There are some brilliant camera movies, some amazing collages of shots, great artwork, and some good old illusion tricks for providing some nice special effects. The movie represents the class struggle, and seeks for equality of rights between the poor and the rich.

'Tis true. This is a case where my mind and heart are at war much as the Metropolis ""planners"" are using their power to keep down the ""workers"".

Intellectually I'm drawn to this film by the innovative use of special effects (I still wonder how the ""face stealing machine"" lightning and light discs were done), its plot (Heavy with double entendre and symbolism with its classic ""David vs. Goliath"" allusion as well as Biblical allusions with its saviour and Virgin Mary figures). My mind even secretly feels a bit smug because it's a ""foreign film"". (Not that it matters that much since all the subtitles are in English and there's no dialogue)

Emotionally I never get swept away though. My heart never REALLY cares all that much about the workers' plight or feels shock at the callous disregard of them by the planners. You don't really find out WHY Frederson falls in love with Maria...he just DOES. They also don't seem to go into the motivations of Freder to be the king figure he strikes in the film.

955783,5,6305013578,"We all have many reasons for being interested in movies. Or in film. Or in cinema. Or today in video.  Most of us seek laughter, pathos, or sheer entertainment. Yet since the establishment of American Movie Classics & more particularly Turner Movie Classics, there has been some growth in what might be called aficianados of film -- those who are truly interested in how modern film developed. (There are also groups who have strong interest in one or more actors -- such as Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy -- or certain directors John Ford, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles, or Alfred Hitchcock.

To the true film student, a video copy of the original METROPOLIS is viewed more for its groundbreaking cinematic techniques than for its story alone.  There are many unique techniques & effects in METROPOLIS that have since been give further advancement.  Clearly, we would never have had the STAR WARS series had it not been for the earlier METROPOLIS. Yet METROPOLIS somewhat pales in comparison to any of the STAR WARS series (particularly the first).  Somehow the first of any series is normally the best. And many find  pioneering initial films too simplistic for true appecition.  It is much like watching Johnny Weismuller or Elmo Lincoln as TARZAN & trying to compare this shaky, fuzzy film with a more modern, slck color GREYSTOKE.

It may now be difficult to appreciate METROPOLIS or the CABINET of DR, CALIGARI or D. W. Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION in the same way these films were appreciated when issued. Bear in mind, usually we see these classics only on a tiny TV screen.  Consider how much more effective they might have been with sharp prints, on a huge theatre screen, & with majestic musical accompanyment of an organ or perhaps a full symphony orchestra.

Also there is no power like the power of an idea encountered the first time. So while I cannot recommand METROPOLIS or any classic silent film to the average film viewer of today complete with mounds of popcorn & gallons of soft drinks, it is a brilliant film. It is still brilliant, & still offers us a world of tomorrow that may yet prove closer to reality than we might wish.

Certainly no student of film as a medium should fail to see and to study METROPOLIS. It offers far more film vistas and futuristic life dilemmas than perhaps any other film of its time & type

955847,5,6305013578,"This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period. The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.

In fact the movie was immediatly cut almost as soon as it was first shown and especially when it came to the United States. The basic story was the same but we lose so much as far as getting to know the characters better among various differnt subplots going on along with the main story.

Unfortunatly for us all much of the original footage which was cut from the original screening is lost or beyond repair. However, a great deal of the scenes were in fact found, restored, and reintroduced into the flim for the first time since it's premiere in Berlin. Scenes which were either still missing or beyone repair were still used either by using stills or by text explaining the scene. Along with this beautifly restored picture we are given the orginal soundtrack used during it's premiere.

The making of special feature was a welcomed suprise as we are told of the painstaking efforts by the crew in Germany to bring this most influential of all the German impressionist films.

955850,5,6305013578,"I'd heard a bit about the 1927 film Metropolis from a couple of sci-fi documentaries. Apparently its potrayal of a futuristic city has been pretty influential in science-fiction films. They are some signficant shots of the city, I do agree, but there's plenty of other things about this German silent film to like too.

The city of Metropolis is a sophisticated place, full of traffic, skyscrapers and aeroplanes. The people above the ground have a pretty relaxed lifestyle, while the city of workers underground put in all the hard work maintaining the generators and the like. Freder Fredersen is one of the above ground citizens, son of the metropolis leader Joh Fredersen. He is drawn to the underground by a woman named Maria, who invites him to come see his ""brothers"". Maria is a teacher, who calms the workers frustrations and asks them to be patient, encouraging them to wait for the day when a mediator will come and heal the rift between the ""mind"" of Metropolis and the ""hands"". It is a visit that changes Freder's life and melts his heart, for he falls in love with Maria and finds compassion for the workers. Meanwhile, a scientist under Joh Fredersen's employ has created a robot in man's likeness, one that can realistically take on the form of a human being. They get the robot to take the form of Maria, and send it underground to stir up the workers, hoping this will bring them more into line. But things don't go as planned, and soon both worlds are stirred...

Being a lengthy silent film, there's a lot of time and space to soak up director Fritz Lang's world, which I really appreciated. Though it's a film from 1920s Germany (not a time known for its wealth), it feels surprisingly high budget, with a large cast of extras, big sets, and significant special effects. Even eighty years on, I think the robot, as well as the way it wears its human form, is pretty creepy. I love the lighting as well. There's actually a lot going on thematically in ""Metropolis"", and though some of the imagery and allusions here and there are curious choices, I do like the message of the film, that thoughts and actions, be they of an individual or of a society, work together best when mediated by a heart.

955852,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's imaginative, awe-inspiring and revolutionary epic is the stuff of legend. It is a film that has left a permanent imprint in the world of motion pictures and has been praised by many as one of the greatest films ever made. The production as a whole with its intricate sets, inventive costumes and state-of-the-art special effect (which were ahead of it's time) are still impressive today, 80 years later.

The story offers a bleak interpretation of the future, a society divided in to two groups; the ""thinkers"" (the wealthy) and the ""workers"" (the exploited lower class). The workers live in underground dwellings underneath the glittering, modern, upper city of Metropolis where the wealthy reside and they work countless hours in order to maintain it and keep it operating. The workers leader, Maria, is their beacon of light. She is constantly preaching peace; love and understanding hoping that one day a ""mediator"" will rise among them and unite the two rivaling classes. Secretly watching Maria during one of her meetings is Freder Fredersen, the young, handsome son of Johhan Fredersen, the mastor of Metropolis. Freder falls deeply in love with Maria so Joh Fredersen orders Rotwang, an inventor who has just created a ""man machine"", to give the robot Maria's likeness. Joh Fredersen's plan is to set it loose among the workers and have them turn on her. Rotwang, however has other plans and decides to use the robot ""Maria"" to destroy Joh and Metropolis.

Power, greed, corruption and slavery are the main focus here and are enhanced by the constant use of religious imagery throughout the film. Despite the films age, the complicated sets and backdrops are spectacular and beautiful to behold. From the sweeping views of the ultra-modern Metropolis with its imposing skyscrapers, endless stream of cars and airplanes which fly within city limits to the workers' smog-infested dwellings and the majestic work machines that run their lives to the thousands of extras who were carefully set and choreographed all contribute in giving ""Metropolis"" its trancelike quality.

After 80 years of mistreatment and mutilation, Fritz Lang's extraordinary, expressionist masterpiece can finally be seen in a restored authorized edition that is crisp, clear, visually stimulating and with very minimal impurities present. It is surprising that they were able to ""clean up"" the film so well considering it's tumultuous history and the pain-staking restoration process but fans of fantasy, sci-fi and movie buffs in general should be thankful that ""Metropolis"" can now be seen with no blurred images and unsightly scratches. We are able to experience the overwhelming beauty of the mythical sets, the costumes and the surreal, dreamlike images that adorn this marvelous film like no other in recent memory.

There are certain films that need to be viewed at least once and deserve to be in everyone's DVD collection no matter what one's personal taste in films is. ""Metropolis"" is one of those films. It's bizarre, splendid images of a futuristic society where half of the population is subjugated may be far-fetched (or is it?) but few can deny its utter impact, its grisly beauty, its haunting surrealism that has inspired countless of film makers to this very day and of course, Fritz Lang's undeniable creative genius. This film is a masterpiece of the highest order and one of the greatest silent expressionist motion pictures ever made. You will be doing yourself a disservice by denying its existence.

955853,5,6305013578,"This is the best verison of Lang's Metropolis that I've seen, and in several ways. The image quality stands out immediately, an amazing bit of film restoration. I'd believe that part of that very clean appearance came from the editors' access to multiple prints and editions of the film. Using digital techniques, they could pick the best of the bunch for each frame, but also (at least in theory) combine information from the multiple copies of each frame.

Another fine feature of this film took a bit longer to sink in. It had scenes that I'd never seen before. According to the editors' notes, the original had been edited down to a shorter film many times and in many different ways. By comparing the various abridged versions, the current editors were able to piece together a much more complete version of the film. In a few places, the recovered scenes really changed the way I understood the movie. Even so, they say that as much as a quarter of the original appears to be lost, filled in with intertitles to indicate the missing scenes.

Above all, Metropolis is an enduring statement of style. It captures the melodramatic excesses of the silent-film style perfectly. It also demonstrates the Art Deco style of the era in which it was made. The editors, in creating new title frames for this version, also used a bit of typographic style that was once common but now long out of use. Rather than using bold, italics, or underlining, they would s p a c e words to be emphasized - an economic use of type, back in the day when the additional cost for additional families of movable lead type would have been prohibitive. What is most striking is how the style of this movie lives on. ""Bladerunner,"" for example, mimics the pyramidal palace of commerce that appears in this movie's opening. It even copied minor scenes, like one where a blind is drawn over a wall-sized window. I do not think less of Bladerunner's director for invoking Metropolis's imagery, instead I think that much more of Lang's enduring vision.

The transfer presented on Kino is extremely crisp and is made from the best sources. There are wonderfully informative extras: one can tell Kino was trying to do its usually excellent best. However, the projection speed is absurdly fast: I must agree with others who have pointed this out. It is true that certain movements are intended to be ""jerky,"" but that is irrelevant to the actual *speed*. People just move much too quickly throughout; it is simply inaccurate and detracts strongly from the film's mood and pace. Kino's own running time is listed as 124 minutes, and it is only 118 including the restoration credits. It may be that something was lost in translation to NTSC from the European standard, but even if that is the case, a 6-minute difference would not account for a film sped up this much.

The Kino Metropolis is by far the most complete, most viewable version of the film. The film itself is by no means perfect, to modern viewers the ending may seem simplistic and unprobable. It has to be put in the context of the era it was filmed. Communist ideology had currency and philosophers like Spengler where debating the effects of machinery and science on humanity. Metropolis is a science fiction film but it's also a political statement favoring a christian and humanistic resolution to the raging conflicts between the capitalist magnates and the industrial workers in 1920's Germany.

So why I like this film so much? Same as most people, I find it groundbreaking, visually and esthetically beautiful, with great mob scenes ect... but let me just make a couple of points. First of all ... Brigitte Helm... has there ever been any bigger, bluer, crystalline, hypnotic eyes in film than the eyes of Brigitte Helm? I don't think so, even when she is doing that silly dance scene you cannot take your eyes off her. In short she is HOT. Second, the robot of Metropolis has become iconic. From the Ultraman series to C3P0 in Star Wars the design and beauty of the Metropolis robot is yet to be surpassed.

One final point about this version. The restored original score is surprisingly good. I particularly liked the machine room music leading to the Moloch scene. It truly enhances the film.

955901,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is a revolutionary work in the cinematic medium and is considered by many to be the first film of the science fiction genre.  When released in 1927, it stood in stark contrast with American standards of filmmaking, which were mostly shot in open outdoor areas.  Rather than imitate nature, ""Metropolis"" consciously rejected it, with some of the most elaborate and complicated structures ever designed for a motion picture.  In doing so, Lang embraced the modernism of his era, in which mass industry continued to widen the gap between classes.  The films construction of the `man-machine' was an appropriate reflection on the times as well.  As technology was becoming something which people were growing increasingly dependant upon, the worker was transforming into an extension of the machines in which he or she used.  This mechanization and overall feeling of loss in ones own humanity is exemplified by the film's opening shots where the workers switch shifts and operate machinery in a robotic and calculated manner.

""Metropolis"" is often criticized for being overly exaggerated.  People need to take into account when the film was made and the specific context it holds within that particular time period.  Obviously, certain aspects of a work made so long ago may seem awkward to many, when it is being judged according to recent expectations.  Perhaps one of Lang's most amazing achievements lies in how well so much of the material has withstood the test of time and how incredible of an achievement it was back in 1927.  I would further argue that the films expressionism is actually the glue that holds it together.  Whether from the larger-than-life sets constructed in the Babelsburg films studios, to the fictional technology used to construct the `man-machine', the films expressionistic techniques have ultimately heightened the work and helped in making it the artistic achievement and critical success which it has come to be regarded as.",1134950400,8,1984,5.20440251572327
955902,5,6305013578,"""Between the brain that plans and the hands that build there must be a mediator."" This famous quote by Thea von Harbou perfectly summarizes the main theme of the film.

The story takes place in 2026 in the city of Metropolis, where the society is divided into two groups: the elite ruling class (brain that plans) and the working class (the hands that build). The way the city of Metropolis is represented is expressionistic in the way that the two different layers, the underground and the above ground, reflect the emotions as well as the living conditions of the people living there. In the above ground, the elite class lives a luxurious, happy life; entertain themselves in the ""eternal gardens,"" the skyscrapers rising to the sky represent the rising of upper class in wealth and power. Whereas, the workers live in the gloomy labyrinths of the underground, which is the power center of the city; they are stuck in dim buildings that are surrounded by huge machinery. There is no mediator between these two groups until one person from the ruling class dares to go underground; he is terrified with what he sees.

The visual features used in the film are highly impressive especially when the technological conditions of the German film industry in the 1920s are considered. The symbolical usage of lights and shadows as well as the music contribute to the plot, and these features artistically enrich the film. The mechanical and cold atmosphere of the city is successfully represented through architecture. The gestures and mimics of the actors in Metropolis is one of the things that you cannot find in Hollywood films. This is absolutely a masterpiece of silent films.

Lang's film has many levels; one can approach it politically, in terms of class dynamics or in terms of gender and the representation of woman or its association with the evil, etc. The characters are brilliantly used for conveying the sub-themes in the film. You have to see this multidimensional master piece of science fiction; it is a feast for the eye, for the ear and the mind!",1134777600,4,2063,4.871794871794871

It took me a while to cozy to this film because the exaggerated acting style in silent films took me aback at first.  Once I overlooked that aspect I was hooked.  Yes this film is a visual stunner, however, the underlying theme is cooperation between the industrialists and working classes and director Fritz Lang does not lose sight of that.  The films tagline is ""The Head and the Hands Need the Heart to Perservere"".  This theme is delivered tactfully by Lang without being heavyhanded.  What I found interesting is there are any number of subtle and none too subtle Biblical references throughout the narrative of ""Metropolis"".  For that matter there's alot of food for thought on hand here.  Today's makers of fantasy films should use this film as an example.

The storyline has been thoroughly presented in these reviews: the segregated society of the haves and have-nots living in a mechanized world. The saintly Maria who wishes for a mediator between the Hands (the subterranean workers) and the Heads (the surface revelers but most specifically Mr Frederson senior, the 'Creator' of Metropolis). There is a significant and rather clumsy religious overtone to the story which in retrospect (it is a 1927 movie) should not have been a surprise. What also should not have been a surprise was the lusty frolicksome behavior on display (pre-code!!) considering that the movie was, again, filmed during the Weimar Republic. Think ""Cabaret"". Anyway, the visual are truly spectacular once your disbelief is fully suspended. The ""mad scientist"" scenes rival modern day attempts and are simply amazing.

955906,5,6305013578,"'Metropolis' is absolutely one of the greatest films ever made. Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.

The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.

What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams. It is however, ridiculous that the film was labelled as a flop on its release. It is even more outrageous that a good chunk of footage from the original print of the film is now irretrievably lost because the film was re-edited. Although it has been restored as much as possible, it is such a shame that it is incomplete.

'Metropolis' is a film that has made more sense and has become more understood as time has passed. It is now greatly praised and has rightly been given the honour as the greatest German film from the silent era.",1126483200,3,1586,4.5

955908,5,6305013578,"One of the most important things regarding a remastering of a film onto DVD is that 1) if it is a film, such as Metropolis, that has existed in scratchy and truncated prints for decades, that it becomes completely realized and cleaned up, and 2) the special features are adequate.  This film does both in an exemplary fashion.  I had seen Metropolis before this KINO DVD version, but the print was scratchy, the music wasn't totally appropriate (not the bad 80's rock score, but cheap classical stuff), and the story didn't make much sense.  This time, with the use of intertitles to fill in the story gaps (though, sadly, one wishes to have seen everything), and a finite transfer cleaning up every speck and sratch on the original film negative, it's like seeing a film of today's caliber.  Onlt the criterion DVD's have as high a standard as the Metropolis DVD does, and rightfully so- It's Lang's silent-film masterpiece, and hopefully this DVD will stick around for years and years to come, so future fantasy/sci-fi film fans can come to this and see where almost all of the influence for films in the modern genre came from.

955958,4,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis turned out to be overall very entertaining and successful. I started watching the movie without very high expectations because of the fact that there were no speaking roles. Despite this, Alfred Abel did an incredible job acting as Johhan Fredersen and Gustav Fr&ouml;hlich as Freder Fredersen. I learned that you don't need words in a movie to make it a good movie.

Metropolis starts off with a bunch of men working in an organized, ""mechanical"" form. We are soon introduced to Freder who's hanging around beautiful women. Soon he meets Maria, who is bringing children to the garden to work. Freder is attracted to Maria and soon descends to where the workers are. He witnesses an explosion when a worker collapses and takes his place. He then realizes that Maria is a lead worker. She tells him that there will be someone who will come and save them from the machines. Freder's father has other plans. With the help of the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) they plan to replace the workers with robots and decide to start with Maria.

Like every movie this one had its ups and downs. Overall in this film, I feel the ""ups"" outweighed the ""downs"". I thought the acting was superb even though there were no words. The quote ""actions speak louder than words"" could definitely describe Metropolis. The actors did a great job in their dramatic gestures and making their movements big so people could clearly grasp the concept and emotions they were trying to convey.

A weaker side of the movie was the scenes that seemed to drag on forever. I lost interest in some scenes and found it hard to focus/follow at times. That is basically the only down point I found in the film.

I absolutely recommend this film. I would recommend it more for the learning purposes rather than the entertaining purposes.

Long ago I've read ""Metropolis"" is in the

class with Animal Farm, 1984, Brave New World.

I had great expectation. Now I've seen it.

What was this? let see, what happens, and

what the message is.

1. Big city, skyscrapers, cars, trains, airplanes.

Air bridges. Futuristic.

2. Rich live in the suny paradise, workers

- down underground. Promissing. Suppressed

workers, black uniforms, heads down, marching

slow  to work, exhausted at the end of the

shift. Communist propaganda? Not surprising,

movie was made before 1927.

3. The Son of The Rich suddenly falls in love

with an unkown girl. Is this turning into a

love story? I thought, it is about totalitarizm,

big brother etc.

4. Son and Father: The Son had no clue, he had

poor children and workers, who live UNDERGROUND

""where they belong"", and work in Hell. Feeding

Moloch with their blood and flesh. (Did I mention

communism?)

5. Lonely Mad Evil Handicap Scientist.

I can swallow Mad Evil and Lonely, it was very

modern at the this time. Message: Handicap

is EVIL! Who said, Hitler loved this movie?

Still wonder why?

6. Maria is a devouted catholic preaching

bible to poor workers. How touching! Head

Heart, Hand: Let us all love each other!

You can forget about Suny paradise at the

beginning and the Hot Hell, workers spend

10 hours in, every day, 7 days a week!

7. Evil handicap hijacks Maria. EVIL HANDICAP!

8. Evil machine is created and let free.

Programmed to destroy the beautiful world of

the Rich, and the Beautiful Underground World

of the poor. The Eveil Communist machine

is preaching Revolution and destruction

of the machines. (Did I mention the Evil

handicap who programmed it?) In addition,

to make sure that everyone understands Evil

Machine is really Evil, the Machine is

dancing naked in the RedLantern District.

She showed her breast! Sex is Very Very bad.

And whose guilt? Don't forget Evil Handicap?

Yes, the mad, mad Evil Handicap scientist!

Science is just as bad as sex!

*So far, let see:

Bible, Maria and Son of the Rich = Good.

Machines, sex, science = bad.

(what happened to bigbrother and poor

workers and their children?)

But to make things even more illogical,

the Rich Fredersen Senior, does not

mind that workers use violence: Then,

he can use violence against them.

Communist propaganda again?

9. Flood. Destruction. Children i danger.

The Son of the Rich makes a heroic efforts

and saves the children. Is this an action?

And I thought, it was a love story? Or

communist propaganda? Or catholic

propaganda?

10. Finally, evil robot is burned to the

stake, like a witch, Evil Handicap is dead,

and true Maria makes the connection

Head, Heart, Hand and is united with her

true love, the Son of the Rich.

And all lived Happily Ever After!

(all except Evil Handicap Scientist

and his communist machine)

Do not recomend this movie.

Not a love story.

Not an action, not a scifi either.

Chaplin from the same period

lived, check out ""Germinal"" by Emile Zola.

Aside from a few scenes here and there (together with the caveat that entire sections of the film have been lost forever), the images are pristine. Sure, choosing to include the original German intertitles would have made for a nice feature, but their absence is more than compensated by the success of the restoration.

As for the film itself, ""Metropolis"" absolutely deserves to be watched. ""Metropolis"" is my least favorite of the Lang films I've seen -- and yet its brilliance makes it an important addition to the collection of any serious film buff. Its photography is beautiful, its actors are convincing, its sets are ornate, and its story is interesting -- particularly viewed within the proper historical context. The message behind ""Metropolis"" is decidedly social democratic / democratic socialist: the slave-workers are forced to toil beneath a nightmarish urban landscape to preserve the luxiorous existence of the opulent few who live in a utopic garden-community in the sky, utterly shielded from the misery their existence inflicts on others. Obviously, an indictment of capitalism, at least as it existed in the industrialized world (e.g., Germany) in the early part of the twentieth century. Along comes Maria, a beautiful peasant woman who inspires the workers with hope by arguing for nonviolent resistance and reconciliation with the capitalist class, and that a mediator is needed to bridge the divide. That mediator turns out to be young Freder, son of capitalist Fredersen, who sympathizes with the plight of the slave-workers and quickly falls in love with Maria. To subvert the nascent labor movement, Freder's father, who learns of the plan, convinces a talented inventor to create a Maria-like android, who incites the workers to violence -- providing the capitalists with a pretext for crushing the workers through force. Clearly, Lang is suggesting that advocates of anti-capitalist violence (e.g., the Communists) serve the interests of the capitalists.

Why is this expressionistic masterpiece my least favorite Lang film? The reasons are hard to pinpoint, but ""Metropolis"" has a vague ""Hollywood""-feel, which I regard as unfortunate. More importantly, the ending is overly sentimental. If a person could own only one Lang film, ""M"" or ""Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler"" would certainly be the better choice.

My review for the 2003 release is below. This one is for the 2010 release Kino version of the so called ""complete"" Metropolis. Well let us set the record straight right off the top by saying the 2010 release is NOT complete. It is between 6-9 minutes short of the original theatrical release,but it is the most complete as of now. An extra 25 or so minutes was found in an archive in Buenos Aires,but in a reduced frame of 16mm. It was in a terribly scratched condition and the archivists in Germany did their utmost to reduce the effects. With that extra footage added in,while it is not complete,it is,to date,the most complete and the movies plot now makes sense for the first time since its release back in the 20s. Like the 2003 Kino edition,this new 2010 edition is a marvel of restoration. It also boasts two discs. The second disc contains a documentary on the making of the film and its restoration,along with an interview with the curator of the museum in Buenos Aires where the footage was discovered. So for those that think that this 2010 release is just a re-release of the 2003 edition it is not. This is the definitive version right now and I highly recommend this new title for purchase. It is outstanding for its historic value and the restoration work accomplished on it. Kudos to all who were involved.

All major studios the world over take note!! This is THE film by which all your restoration and release work should be measured by.
As a movie this version,the most complete ever released,is one of the masterpieces of the cinema in any age.
As an end product of extensive and exhaustive restoration work,this is the new benchmark by which all studios should be releasing their products whether old or new!!
I won't bore the reader with details of the exact process by which this was done(the accompanying liner notes in this DVD are quite clear on the subject),but I will say I have never seen a movie that was originally in this terrible of a condition literally reborn through the efforts of two archival groups in Munich and Wiesbaden,Germany.
Fritz Lang,the former art student turned scenarist turned director had  become one of Germanys' Universum Film Aktien Gesellschafts'(UFA for short) brightest talents.
Lang who co wrote the story for Metropolis with his wife,always preferred his movies/sets on the grand scale and this one was no exception. When released world wide in 1927 it caused quite the sensation and Lang was courted by every major studio around the globe for his services.
Langs's story works on many levels from labour versus management,mechanization versus humanity,good versus evil,etc. But Lang's grand vision and scale brilliantly binds everything together,while his attention to small details and deft touches reinforces the tale. A prime example of this would be Langs' staging of the changing of the workers' shift. The workers leave their stations in precise rows and groups,walking in step,heads bent forward. They enter an elevator. They exit the elevator again in tandem,heads still down. This ""choreography"" reinforces wonderfully our empathy for these downtrodden and depleted people/slaves. The workers who enter the elevator to replace their spent brethren also walk in tandem but their heads are held upright. But you know that come the end of their shift it will be they who will walk with heads down once more, bent over with the pain of exhaustion and continuing the never ending cycle of hopelessness and despair.
Powerful scenes with much to say and Lang did it masterfully.
This movie deserves each star(and more!) I've given it.
Kudos to Transit Films in Germany for its phenomenal work in the restoration of this ""silent"" masterpiece and to Kino in the U.S. for obtaining the rights to release this on DVD here in North America.

Despite the film's hyper-drama and viciously precise arm movement, it is a riveting study that compellingly mirrors the French Revolution and yet eerily foretells the rise of Fascism. It invokes distinctly Germanic art styles as we see Freder become a black-uniformed living transistor, fully 20 years before transistors were invented.

No movement, no lighting change is extemporaneous; in legendary Teutonic vision, every frame is set exactly as it must be.

As an example of the film's relentless angst, the governor, Joh Fredersen, beholds his son breathtakingly idolizing a Joan of Arc character, Maria, to the revolutionary strains of La Marseillaise.  Maria's gaze is mesmerizing.

To regain his son and control a worker's revolt, the governor beseeches an old nemesis to turn the first robot into a Maria automaton, but a Lorelei-type emissary.  Joh's desperation is Freder's undoing and, later, his own.  As the great city begins to hemorrhage, a fight for the future of the republic ensues.

Unfortunately the film was birth-strangled - like Once Upon a Time in America and The Magnificent Ambersons - and it falls into the strange pantheon of movies that are as fragmentary as any ancient scroll.
This only added to the appeal, of course. Like the wine buff who sighs to drink one of THE French vintages from before 1860, cineastes have spculated and respeculated about this fragmentary masterpiece. Why doesn't the story make sense? What was the movie originally like - and can it be fixed?
It is a pity that this film will almost certainly NEVER be completely restored. Like The Magnificent Ambersons, this is a masterpiece that seems permanently damaged. But in 2002, the next best thing was done; and the most complete possible restoration was carried out.
The results are truly remarkable. You can see that silent films were NOT originally shown in a spotty, scratchy condition with hyperactive actors. When they first came out, silent movies looked just as good as any modern movie (well, maybe less screen-resolution). The original soundtrack was discovered and recorded - and it, too, is a revelation. Silent movies were NOT actually silent - they had live soundtracks (though only rich premieres had full orchestras). The soundtrack is as well-composed as any modern soundtrack. I initially thought I would not be able to get used to another soundtrack after hearing the Moroder version - but now I think I can't see the film any other way.
Most importantly, the film now actually makes sense! Every scrap of film possible was extracted from archives all over the world, to make the film as complete as is humanly possible. The scenes still missing (alas, comprising a quarter of the film even now) are signified by intertitles telling the audience what they ought to be seeing. This is not a perfect compromise, but it's probably the best solution.
Silent movies often look strangely modern, since they concentrate almost entirely on visuals at the expense of the actors (a feature that, incidentally, made movies easier to show overseas than any modern movie). Compare that to our movies, which are very heavy on visuals and contain the simplest and least amount of dialogue possible in order to cater to foreign markets. Also, the complete manipulation of the image, so favoured in Metropolis, is very much like modern computer graphics.",1088726400,4,2515,5.004773269689737
956018,5,6305013578,"In today's cinematic world, silent movies are often a difficult category to approach.  Silent movies are usually referred to almost like a separate genre, as if black and white movies were a single genre.  Even silent flick enthusiasts sometimes don't have the right attitude, because the modern appreciation of pre-talkie movies is sometims nothing more shallow than appreciation of a movie because it is a silent movie.  This attitude streams from the modern audience that views the silent era as embryonic of the talkies, as technologically handicapped, when in fact, the contemporary audiences of the 20's did not view their motion pictures the same way.
Metropolis is a great move that overcomes most of the barriers between moderns audiences and silent movies.  The genre is unmistakably sci-fi--the forerunner to nearly all modern sci-fi movies.  It was a fantastic movie that just happens to be a silent movie, and anybody who sees it will understand that silence is not a handicap.
The biggest barrier for silent movies is that there are usually variant DVD editions in circulation, and unlike pictures made in the last few decades, it really does matter which edition you see.  Kino's restored edition is (and shall be for a while if not forever) the definitive edition of Metropolis.  I had been viewing an incomplete, incoherent version of the film for years before i treated myself to Kino's delightfully exhaustive work, and it was then that i realized what i had been missing.  Watching this version was like watching a different movie.  In fact, the restoration is so immaculate, it was like watching a movie that was just filmed yesterday, or rather, like i was watching it in 1926.
Kino should be praised for the edition (which they have been), that vindicates fans of Metropolis, sci-fi, and silent movies.  Even the flaws are reasonable: some scenes are missing, but they are filled in with explanations and still photos, when available; there could have been enough extras to fill 2 more discs, although the extras included are sufficient and repeatable, as compared to the loads of extras fans normally demand but rarely ever watch.
All in all, this is an excellent restoration of an epic movie that deserves this treatment and attention.  Include the Kino version in your collection over all of the inferior versions circulating.",1086652800,,2352,5.051679586563307

956020,5,6305013578,"It's tough to argue that Fritz Lang's 1926 classic ""Metropolis"" is anything but a cinematic masterpiece. Lang, a master of what critics have since labeled German Expressionism, had an illustrious career in the movie making business in Germany as well as the United States. He came over here to escape the rise of the National Socialists in 1933. Once in Hollywood, he continued to make memorable films such as ""M,"" a movie about a killer based loosely on the monstrous German murderer Peter Kurten. Lang made films well into the 1960s, although none had quite the impact of this silent movie classic. For years, you couldn't see a decent version of ""Metropolis."" The film is so old that it has fallen into the realm of public domain property, which virtually assured that every fast buck artist on the fringes of the movie business would release a smudgy, hacked up version of the movie. Thanks to the Murnau Foundation, a film restoration project devoted to restoring early twentieth century films, we can now see ""Metropolis"" in a form closer to the original. It's not perfect, not by a long shot, since a significant portion of the movie has disappeared, but what we do get looks fantastic. I watched a restored version of ""Nosferatu"" recently and it couldn't compare to how ""Metropolis"" looked.
""Metropolis"" takes place in a bleak futuristic city of rigidly defined social classes. The haves, presided over by powerful industrialist Freder Fredersen and his son Joh, live in the highest buildings from which they run the bustling city. Unfortunate souls, which include just about everyone else, live underground in huge apartment type dwellings. This keeps the workers close to the huge machinery that runs the city's various industries and buildings. It also keeps the proletariats confined in easily controlled and policed areas. Life basically stinks for the workers in Metropolis, where their existence consists of endless and dreary work shifts with little time left over for amusement. Moreover, the work is extremely dangerous and demanding. It isn't unusual at all to see the machines chewing up laborers whose attention strays from their tasks for a few seconds. If this description makes you think of Marx, communism, socialism, or class struggle, you're on the right track. The movie was made during a time when these issues dominated the thoughts of millions of people around the world. ""Metropolis"" is the sort of movie Upton Sinclair or Jack London might have made had they been filmmakers instead of writers.
The social situation in Metropolis is about to change. As Joh Frederson basks in the luxurious surroundings of a massive club built for the city's affluent youngsters, he catches sight of a beautiful prole named Maria who accidentally leads a group of workers' children up to the top of the building. She quickly apologizes for straying from her assigned areas, and in the process calls Joh ""brother."" Intrigued, the rich youth begins to search for this lovely vision despite the strict oversight of his demanding father. Joh wanders into the byzantine depths of the city, switching his identity with a worker and even toiling away at a wearisome task. Meanwhile, up in the Fredersen control center, Joh's father meets with a scientist named Rotwang to discuss the turmoil going on down in the worker areas. This technician is responsible for most of the mechanical innovations of the city, and he's planning a special treat for the clueless workers. The leader of a movement to destroy the plutocracy just happens to be the beautiful young girl Joh is seeking out; so the crazed scientist builds a robot that looks just like her. He programs this machine to mislead the dissident workers, thus insuring the plutocrats will continue to rule. Things don't quite work out the way the oligarchy plans, however, when Joh uncovers the plot and attempts to bring the two groups of humans together.
There's more to the story than this description. A subplot about Joh's deceased mother factors into the activities of the scientist and his father, for example, but the theme of class warfare dominates every frame of the movie. You'll probably spend more time staring in wonder at the world Lang and his compatriots constructed than you will analyzing a plot that has the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the stomach. The city is an amazing triumph of model mock-ups and painted backgrounds. Planes soar between skyscrapers, cars and trains whiz along suspended tracks, and lights and giant neon screens twinkle and flash. Forget CGI effects; while this movie was made eighty plus years ago, the special effects work is so spectacular that you'll hardly believe they could convincingly pull this off. The great effects extend to the machines and underground scenes, especially in a scene where a huge piece of equipment turns into ""Moloch,"" a living, breathing beast capable of swallowing up whole ranks of hapless workers. ""Metropolis"" served as an early example, if not the only earliest example, of what cinema could really do. I see it as a precursor to the effects laden films of today. That it took sixty to seventy years to match the intensity of this work speaks well of Lang's visionary prowess as a filmmaker.
The DVD contains a plethora of exciting extras. You get a detailed biography of Lang's career, the obligatory commentary track by a film historian, stills, a facts and date feature, a short documentary outlining Lang's career, the film's history, and German Expressionism called ""The Metropolis Case,"" and a restoration featurette. The documentary is quite intriguing, showing how Lang and his crew constructed the special effects for the film. I usually avoid most DVD extras, but I made an exception in the case of ""Metropolis."" All fans of science fiction and effects heavy films owe a huge debt of gratitude to Fritz Lang. Watch ""Metropolis"" as soon as you can.",1086048000,4,5902,5.017329255861366
956021,2,6305013578,"I picked this DVD up at a local store, because I've been meaning to see the movie and it was quite cheap.  It's the original 1927 theater cut (I couldn't tell you if the tinting was added later or not), which means it's only a small part of Lang's masterpeice.  The plot is, as it was, choppy and hard to follow without reading up on the movie itself.  The scenes that were cut seem to have been important, in that you get the general gist of the story with this truncated version, but there are things you won't pick up on unless you watch it repeatedly.
It's a poor version of the classic, but the price is right.  If you want to see the masterpeice, buy the restored, authorized edition as was recommended above.  If you want to watch a mildly entertaining silent film that sounds like the soundtrack was put together by the Residents, this is for you.",1082419200,12,855,4.352201257861635

It's sad because anyone coming to this film new won't be inclined to check out other, far better Lang films: like his first sound film M, with Peter Lorre, or his silent films Spies, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, or Der Nibelungen.",1080777600,2,572,4.617647058823529
956023,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's 1927 cinematic masterpiece METROPOLIS is arguably one of the best and most influential films EVER made...or at least the best and most influential SILENT film ever made.  As a work of cinematic art or literature, it actually functions on two levels.  First, it is an expressionistic cautionary comment on the dehumanizing effects of a mechanized high-tech society, as well as a not-so-subtle jab at the imbalanced social stratification that results from unfettered capitalism.  And secondly, it is one of the first speculative science-fiction movies, offering interesting--and in some cases, prophetic--glimpses into a potential future that offers technological advances such as common commercial flight, video-telephones, mechanical prosthetics, electronic computers, robotics, and much more.
The groundbreaking special FX and film techniques created for and used in METROPOLIS have left an indelible imprint on the SF and horror genres, influencing filmmakers from James Whale to George Lucas and beyond.  Indeed, the special FX seen in the robot-creation scene in METROPOLIS are obviously updated and reinterpreted in the creation scene in Whale's 1931 classic FRANKENSTEIN, and George Lucas has publicly admitted that he was inspired to create his STAR WARS character C3P0 after being awed by the robot character in Lang's film.
As for the plot of METROPOLIS, it is set in the year 2026 and revolves around a slice from the life of young and handsome Freder Fredersen.  Freder is the only offspring of the wealthy politician and businessman who governs the city-state of Metropolis, and as such, he lives a fairly privileged and carefree existence.  But after a happenstance encounter with the beautiful peasant Maria--she a messiah of sorts who preaches a message of peace and hope to the lower classes--Freder follows her into the bowels of Metropolis and quickly learns firsthand the true plight of his city's enslaved working class.  With this newfound social awareness, he is ashamed of the selfish excesses his class obtains on the backs of others, and he resolves to help Maria free her people from a life of perpetual toil and make Metropolis a place where all can share in both the labor AND the fruits therefrom.
Some contemporary audiences eschew METROPOLIS with claims that it is dated and too naive in its worldview.  While the decades since the film's creation have certainly revealed its simple socialist philosophy be both naive AND impractical, it actually isn't all that different from the feel-good subtext of many of today's films.  And there is no cogent grounds for regarding METROPOLIS to be dated or pass, as the narrative is strong, the acting is good (relative to the silent cinema), and most--if not all--of the special FX remain aesthetically powerful and stand strong against even some of Hollywood's modern and lavish CGI FX.
The definitive version of METROPOLIS--at least for the English-speaking audience--is the Restored Authorized Edition from Kino International.  Not only is the image clear, sharp, and relatively clean, but at the points in the film where long-lost segments belong, intertitles are inserted that summarize those missing pieces.  So even though the full visual beauty of the work isn't restored, the logicality of the narrative is.  This is as close to the original as audiences are likely to get, and it is breathtakingly wonderful.  There are some bonus extras on the disc, too, but just having the ""complete"" masterpiece is worth the cost.
A must-see, nay, a MUST-OWN for both science-fiction fans and serious students of the cinema.",1078876800,6,3606,5.294220665499124
956083,5,6305013578,"Metropolis was directed by Fritz Lang and, as a black and white silent film from 1927, had HUGE impacts on filmmakers for decades to come. The tale was of a large city with two classes. There was the elite class that lived above ground, enjoying the fresh air and gardens. Then there was the working class that lived in tightly-packed apartment buildings below ground.  You can find this same theme in hundreds of movies afterwards that were influenced by Metropolis.
What's amazing is that the movie was lost for pretty much the entire time between its release and 2003. Viewers in those years had to make do with bits and pieces of the movie, often with giant gaps in the storyline. This re-release is the result of years of work, where film historians painstakingly went through all sources they could find and cobbled together a version complete with storyboards where gaps were large. For the first time in almost 80 years, viewers can get a sense of what the original story was all about.
The musical score is great, and the storyline is classic. The young man of the elite class falls in love with the young worker woman. There is great strife as the boy's family tries to keep them apart and keep the workers down. The workers believe in prophecies that say they will find a way out of their desolation. The elite believe that their 'golden rule' will last forever. In the middle, a mad scientist believes he has created a robotic woman to keep him happy without any need of human interaction.
There are some minor gripes even with this restored version - the motion is often speeded up, when all notes of the original story indicate that the director deliberately made scenes go slowly to give them importance. This is a German movie, but everything has been done in English so you can't really appreciate its true roots. But even so, this is a stellar achievement and one that can be built on going forward.

In either case, this is clearly the best version of Metropolis I've seen. Both firstime viewers and fans of the film are in  for a revelation.",1077840000,,454,4.973684210526316

See the fun-loving upper class, frolicking their days away, running through eternal gardens, complete with peacocks and babes in funny clothes! Then, travel deep below ground to where the workers toil their days away, slaving over titanic machines that suck the life right out of their bodies and putrify their souls! Sound like your job? Thankfully, Maria is there to comfort the workers and give them hope of future deliverance at the hands of a great ""mediator"". Freder, the son of METROPOLIS' top dog and despotic ruler, is mesmerized by Maria and falls in love with her. This leads to problems since she's such a trouble-maker! Frader's dad goes to his mad scientist, Rotwang to check on his latest creation, a robot with very feminine curves. The two evil minds decide to turn the robot into a Maria-double, a wicked doppelgangar, which will destroy her image in the minds of the workers. Unfortunately for dad, Rotwang has ideas of his own and sends his mecha-Maria on a mission to incite the working class to bring down the machines upon which their very lives depend. This will bring METROPOLIS to the ground and ruin Freder sr. (dad) in the process. METROPOLIS is amazing for 1927. The robot scenes are almost supernatural in their effect. The portrayal of the workers as plodding, hopeless drones is unforgettable. Brigitte Helm pulls off her dual role as good Maria / evil Maria with ease and believability. She is modest and virginal one minute, then wanton and sly the next! The city scape and lower levels of the workers' world are surreal. Fritz Lang made a true masterpiece. This is one of a handful of movies that everyone should see at least once before they die... P.S.- UPDATE- I just watched THE COMPLETE METROPOLIS (on 4-4-13), and I was astonished by its near perfection.

The restauration in this one is one of the most uncaring and unloving  works I have seen.  They did not care if the story in the movie was told smoothly or not, they just said ""hey we found this footage... lets stick it in!!"", and they did.
Some of the the chunks they put in made the story relly on the written letters and less in the image, and some others were just not calibrated at the right speed  (but oh, yeah, we managed to restore this ""lost marvels""... right).

956122,4,6305013578,"I won't repeat what others have already said about the historical significance of this film or its contents.  I do want to share my opinions about the Kino restoration vs the Moroder version.
I already owned the Moroder version when I purchased the Kino restoration on DVD.  Like many others, I was amazed at the incredible visual clarity of the Kino restoration when compared to the Moroder version, as others have said it looks like it was shot yesterday, not 70+ years ago.  Also, seeing it with a performance of the original score provided a different experience.
Some of the other differences are:
1. The Kino version contains some footage missing from the Moroder version, but not a lot more.  The scene that stands out most for me is the first scene in Frederson's office - we gain a better understanding of how hard he works and how much he expects from those below him, so the firing of Josephat and Josaphat's reaction makes more sense than it does in the Moroder version.  Another scene that is significantly different is the first meeting between Frederson and Rotwang - their rivalry is portrayed in greater depth in the Kino restoration, although it is also perfectly clear in the Moroder version.
2. Many `purists' have complained about the music in the Moroder version.  I disagree, I think that the music and the lyrics greatly enhance the emotional impact of the Moroder version.  Don't misunderstand, I think the original orchestral score as presented in the Kino version is great, but words and music together are far more powerful than either alone.
3. The story is a bit different.  Personally, I think that the story as presented in the Moroder version makes more sense, why would Frederson want his workers to revolt?  But this is his motivation for having Rotwang create the machine-man in the Kino restoration.
4. Many `purists' complain about the colorization in the Moroder version.  I admit, there were places where I found it a bit jarring, but overall I think it adds to the emotional tone of the film.  Still, I think the Kino restoration is valuable for what it is, a restoration.
The point I am trying to make is this.  The Kino restoration is an incredible piece of work that will be of great value to all who wish to experience as much of the original film as is possible today.  But, in my opinion the Moroder version, with its modern lyrical score is also of great value, maybe not as much in a historical context but as a separate film experience.  Think of the Moroder version as a new work based on an old work, not as a restoration.
My recommendation?  See them both, but see the Moroder version first, the Kino version second.  Otherwise, you'll be distracted by the degraded video quality in the Moroder version and you'll miss the incredible soundtrack.  Someday when home computers become more powerful and video production software is cheaper and easier to use I'll probably dub the Moroder soundtrack to the Kino video and have the best of both worlds.  Until then, the Moroder video isn't that bad, it is about what you would expect from a 70+ year old silent film, but the Kino video, in comparison, is incredible.
And, by the way, the Japanese animated film produced a couple of years ago bears only the most superficial resemblance to the original, I was seriously disappointed.",1069459200,43,3330,4.7417677642980935
956123,4,6305013578,"The saving grace of this version is that it attempts to restore the original vision of Fritz Lang. However, no version will ever be complete since so much of ""Metropolis"" ended up as scraps on the studio floor with numerous outtakes that will never see the light of day.  A good read is Thomas Elsaesser's book on the movie, published by BFI Film Classics.
What one marvels at is Lang's pyrotechnics, which were pretty amazing at the time.  The story itself is a rather poor one with over-the-top acting, which was the norm in the age of silent movies.  One had to try to connote as much as he could with facial expressions and body language.  It is really hard to figure out what all is going on in this movie.  But, it has been praised over the years for prophesizing the rise of Hitler.
The movie is ostensibly about a totalitarian state run by an industrialist, John Fredersen, who lives high atop a world built upon layers of society. His son, chasing after a lovely vixen, is made privy to this ""underworld"" and vows to destroy the great engine of this society, Moloch.  But, first he has to get past the evil scientist, Rothwang, who has made his love interest into a robot, which will supposedly placate the masses, which seem ready to revolt.  But, Lang didn't seem in control of his vision, as it spins violently out of control leaving as many questions as it does answers.
In its full-length version it is rather boring, and I found myself fast-forwarding through parts which seemed excrutiatingly long-winded.  Kind of like reading an Ayn Rand novel.  But, the cinematic vision of this futureworld is fantastic, drawing on some of the currents in Modern architecture at the time.  Lang's ideas seem to stem more from the rise of Socialism in Europe, than it did the rise of Fascism in Germany.  This seemed to be his greatest fear, although he knew to get out of town when Hitler came to power.  He politely refusing the Furer's offer to be the chief filmmaker of the Third Reich, and took the next ship to America, where he wasted away his remaining years in Hollywood.",1068595200,7,2082,4.597297297297297

The story of a priviledged young man who discovers his father's underground empire of mechanization and virtual slavery is complex and engrossing. You can watch this movie from a variety of different viewpoints (economic, political, sci-fi, entertainment) and continuously discover new ideas.
And of course, the allusion to the Italian superspectacle, Cabiria (Moloch), portrays the machines as demanding human sacrifice to provide the life of luxury for those oblivious souls in the city above
My only complaint with the script is the fact that the director overemphasises the moral of ""brain and hands must be united by the heart."" But this is a minor quibble compared to the gradeur of the movie. I did not have a chance to explore the special features.
I saw quite a few parallels between Metropolis and The Matrix. Not sure if the Wachowski brothers intended this, but it's certainly possible. Common threads: man living in underground cities, man subjugated by machines yet needing them to live, a savior who falls in love with his accomplice in liberating the people...the list goes on.
Truly the definition of a Classic film, right up there with Citizen Kane in its timelessness.",1065744000,7,1506,4.909803921568628
956127,4,6305013578,"Metropolis is a film which is famous for its images: the titanic city, the freaky robot, the columns of workers marching to their machines. It's no wonder, really--the picture cost a whopping 5.3 million marks, was produced by one of the most technically innovative film studios in the world (Germany's Ufa), and was filmed by one of the most influential directors in all of film history, namely Fritz Lang.
So Metropolis is a great film, right? Well, almost. Despite its action and eye-popping visuals, Metropolis is still a political fable which is so naive, so patronizing and shallow, that anyone attempting to take the plot seriously is either going to become apathetic or irritated. Moreover, the cutting of the film from 4,189 meters to 3,421--only those who were present for the first run in Berlin saw the entire film--has hobbled Lang's ordinarily impeccable storytelling.
Nevertheless, the film is a must-see for film students, and it can now even be recommended to the interested casual viewer. The reconstruction in Kino's edition resuscitates a story which was often downright confusing in its previous incarnations, and finally you can actually see what is going on. Anyone who has suffered through one of the many inferior versions of the movie will be ecstatic, and if you haven't seen Metropolis before, forget what you think you know about silent films!
Overall the Kino on Video edition is very well done, with a clean picture (taking into consideration that these images were made 77 years ago) and a great documentary; this should become the definitive edition. The only criticism is that the commentary--or at least the portion that I had the patience to sit through--is utterly devoid of content. Apparently all the good material was used in the documentary, and so the commentary limits itself to being observations about of what is happening on the screen.
The only other thing to mention here is that one reviewer complained that the film was not shown at the correct speed because it occasionally appeared as if it were still speeded up. He then went on to say that he happened to know that certain scenes were actually undercranked for emphasis, apparently thinking that this meant that they would go slower than normal in the finished film. Just the opposite: when film was undercranked (fewer film exposures per second) things appear to go FASTER than normal when screened. So the bits where a character seems to run at inhuman speed across the screen were done on purpose. No need to blame the restorers there.

There are a few title cards, but none are needed at all as these truly talented actors have the extraordinary ability to express intense emotion without words (and without being overdramatic either)!  In addition, the music score expresses all of the emotion you need to comfortably transport you back into this golden era.

The intense contrast in its visual design is so captivating, that you get pulled into the screen and will, no doubt, want to watch it several times to note the artistic details that you may have missed the first time around.

956193,5,6305013578,"When I saw 'Metropolis' at the rental store and its boasting of being newly restored, I couldn't resist finally taking the film home.  I'd read about it dozens of times and knew vaguely what to expect, and I had even seen the anime film 'Metropolis' which was obviously inspired in no small part by this wondrous achievement in filmmaking.
I'm not knowledgeable enough in cinema history and technique to give this film a just review, but I will mention a few things that touched me on a very personal, mental level.
The theme of mediation between hand and heart is genuinely touching, and it reminded me of Hegel's notion of synthesis as well as his master/slave dialectic.  Not literally, of course, since in the film, the workers don't actually come to the conclusion that the results of their labor belong to them, and mediation is touted as being more desireable than conflict, but overall, I couldn't ignore the Hegelian implications the film depicted.
While reading 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand, though she described (at length, I must lament) what her fictional world consisted of, I could never really visualize it in any meaningful way.  Well, 'Metropolis' has certainly shown me what Rand's ideal universe would be--a grand construct borne of a reigning ubermensch who lives on the backs, flesh, blood, and sweat of human cogs who are expected to gratefully ""contribute"" to the comfort and luxury of those more ""rational"" than they.  Fortunately, 'Metropolis' does not force us to choose sides in this tale, and it decidedly refrains from proselytizing to its audience.  We can completely sympathize with the workers and their plight, and their horrendous working conditions, their hapless melding with machine, is intolerable.  But at the same time we witness the efficiency and splendor of Metropolis, and Frederson doesn't seem to be an evil man.  It's obvious that he loves his son, and he can almost be seen as more of a workaholic and overachiever than anything else.
As others have mentioned, the film speed seems distorted in certain scenes, and I was unfortunately reminded of those humorous old ""cops and robbers"" chase scenes where everything is comically jerky and spastic.  Not the most dignified cinematic imagery to say the least, but I tried my best to overlook it.
The special effects, sets, costuming and score are wonderful, and I haven't seen many silent films, so I can't compare the acting in 'Metropolis' to the acting in other silents, but I thoroughly enjoyed the work of every actor in this film, especially that of the woman who played Maria.  Her Machine-Man was brilliantly creepy and diabolical, and I loved her facial expressions and body-language.  And in regards to the sets and art, I couldn't believe the complexity and vitality of Metropolis.  Countless incredible images can be found in this city, and even its macabre destruction was more the death of an organic entity than the mere crumbling of wire, steel, and asphalt.
There's no question in my mind why 'Metropolis' is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and it is such works of art as this that can so successfully evoke the tragedy of the human condition and then redeem it in one fell, glorious swoop.  There's no reason not to see this movie, period.",1058054400,6,3271,4.927272727272728
956194,5,6305013578,"It is sad that so many great works of art have been lost or butchered for various reasons over the centuries.  And even though it is often impossible to restore them to their original glory, it is a worthy effort to try to do so.  Recut and reworked after its original presentation in 1927, Metropolis will likely never again be seen in its original form due to lost footage; however, the creators of the cut shown on this DVD have given us a good sense of what that film was like.
Though my experience with silent films is minimal, a youth spent as a science fiction buff introduced me to this film.  I had seen bits and pieces of it growing up but had never sat down to watch the entire thing until I obtained this DVD.  What an amazing experience!  I am sorry I waited so long to see it.  This film intertwines a love story, revenge story and social commentary with amazing special effects to create a powerful movie experience.  Few movies today can achieve the kind of success that Lang was able to create over 70 years ago.
It is a bit sad to come across those moments in the film where text has to break in and explain what happens in footage that has been lost.  (The intriguing character of ""the thin man"" has been almost entirely lost.)  Still, the creators of this cut have done Lang yeoman's service.  You have not seen Metropolis until you have seen this cut.

Now for the first time you can see the film in all that was found and able to restore.  For this generation, you might recall seeing some scenes in the intro for the Fred Savage tv series ""Working"" (1997-1999).

956196,4,6305013578,"The original ""Metropolis"" as conceived by Fritz Lang in 1926 is, regrettably, lost. The wholesale gutting by Channing Pollock of the original in the US and the UFA (in Germany) hatchet job of 1927 have ensured that the most ambitious German film of the 1920s (and the most expensive) is lost. The Kino version is the most comprehensive reconstruction possible with existing resources, without resort to the use of stills as Giorgio Moroder did in his mid 1980s iteration. Kino is to be congratulated in reviving the original score and including a feature of rare stills and explanatory notes to the DVD.
A couple of observations first, the quality of the film is excellent thanks to an assiduous remastering. Sound is good for the score (it is a silent movie after all), titles are the originals as printed, and the whole effort has been to recreate authentically a truncated masterpiece. I've seen a number of different prints of the film over the last twenty years, but the quality of this presentation is unbeaten. The only negatives are the scanty biographies of the principals, which any devotee would dismiss as insubstantial, and the failure to use some of the stills Moroder used back in 1986. There is at least one tracking shot in the Moroder colourised version, of the Hel sculpture (and that is spelt ""Hel""), which has been left out of the Kino disk. It can be argued that using stills would only detract from the objective of re-creating as fully as possible the ""moving picture"" of Metropolis. A more fulsome extract of the original plot at the end would have been appreciated. There are a number of out of print books (by Ace SF and Lorrimer Classic Film Scripts) including the screenplay and the novelisation which could have been used for an explanatory synopsis.
These are minor misgivings, the disk recaptures the wonder of the original as much as possible. It is unlikely that any devotee could acquire a better record of this relic of the silent era. I can heartily recommend it, and hope all viewers experience the enjoyment I felt as a teenager going to a midnight showing in a seedy part of town of the renowned ""Metropolis""...",1055289600,5,2151,4.800539083557951

The second best part is the score!  What a great piece of music which was actually written for the film.  In fact, much of the success of the restoration is due to the score, since the detailed cues and scene descriptions in the score gave the restorers a perfect, original overview upon which to base their work.
Last, but not least, the picture quality is miraculous.  Watching the featurette concerning the restoration showed what meticulous care went into it.  And it shows!

Additionally, I appreciated the fact that title card interstitials stood alone, and weren't superimposed over the action.
As for my feelings about Metropolis itself, I love this film.  The heart mediation theme is touching and hopeful, and the characters of Freder and Maria are adorable.  Additionally, the visuals are stunningly relevant to our postmodern sensibilities - the robot is chillingly beautiful...Yoshiwara is mysteriously exquisite...and the new Tower of Babel is simply gorgeous in an overdone, overbuilt urban way.  The city visuals are very compelling, influencing our future-notions even today (remember Horizons at Walt Disney World?  The future home of the 1920s?  VERY Metropolis-looking!).

This is basically the dilemma that presents itself to anyone who attempts to re-create METROPOLIS.
The ""Restored Authorized Edition"" is the umteenth release of a ""version"" of Thea von Harbou's and Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS. And, again it's a not the ""original"" release. It's someone else's idea (in this case Enno Patalas's) of what METROPOLIS was supposed to look and sound like in 1926/7. Still, the Patalas' version-- in stark contrast to other famous re-releases such as the Giorgio Moroder version released in the 1980's-- actually shows a more faithful adherence to the von Harbou/Lang vision and offers the viewer a closer approximation to what they intended. In comparison to the Patalas release, Moroder's version is nothing more than historically anecdotal. The color tinting and the grotesque, ""modern"" soundtrack Moroder added were totally inappropriate. Thankfully, the Patalas release avoids such self-aggrandizing vanities. On the very big plus side, the Patalas version uses the original Huppertz soundtrack.
Did these restorers have the presence of mind and the personal integrity to re-create METROPOLIS without diluting it, adding their own personal ""stamp"" on the restored version? Sadly no. Perhaps, someday someone will. Until then this is an enjoyable alternative. The process of ""restoration"" and transfer to DVD are not without their flaws, but given the fact that the orginial is nearly 80 years old, the copy is clean, crisp, and worthy of kudos.",1054339200,2,1726,5.372693726937269
956242,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS was very successful with both critics and audiences when it debuted in 1927 Berlin--but it was thereafter edited for distribution by Channing Pollock, who disliked it and removed great chunks of the film and substantially altered the storyline.  The resulting film was admired for its visual style, but it proved a critical and box office disappointment.  Neglected in the wake of sound, surviving prints of the film were left to corrode and decay--and when it began to reach the home market via VHS and DVD the results were very hit or miss; Blackhawk released a fairly credible version of the truncated film to home video, but for the most part the quality of these releases varied from barely mediocre to downright unwatchable.

Until now.

A great chunk of METROPOLIS--perhaps as much a quarter of more--has been forever lost, but this Kino Video DVD release offers the single best version of the film available.  The previously cut footage that still exists has been restored; gaps in the film have been bridged by the occasional use of stills and explanatory title cards; the film itself has been painstakingly and digitally restored; and the soundtrack is the Gottfried Huppertz original created for the film's 1927 Berlin debut. In seeing this version of METROPOLIS, I was struck by how very differently it reads from the previously available truncated version.  The visual style and the story itself are much more exciting and cohesive, and in the wake of this restoration it becomes impossible to deny the film status as landmark of international cinema.

Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich) is the son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Able), who reigns over the great city of Metropolis.  Freder is surprised to discover his lifestyle has been built on the unseen but backbreaking labor of an entire class of unseen workers who tend the machines that make the city run--and he descends to the subterranean levels of Metropolis in an effort to understand their lives... and, not incidentally, to find the mysterious but beautiful woman Maria (Brigitta Helm) who has inspired his interest in the workers' plight.  But his father is concerned by both Freder's interest and Maria's activities among the workers, and he turns to scientist C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) for aid.  Rotwang has created a robot, and he agrees to give it the likeness of Maria in order to undermine both Freder's love for the girl and her own activities.  But Rotwang has a hidden agenda of his own: once the robot has been unleashed, he will use her to destroy Metropolis and thereby exact revenge on Joh Fredersen for past transgressions against him.

In many respects the story is simplistic, but the film's visual style and connotations are anything but.  Deeply influenced by such art movements as Expressionism, Objectivism, Art Deco, and Bauhaus, the film is visually fascinating--not only in its scenic designs, but in director Lang's famous skill at creating the powerful crowd scenes that dominate the film and building the pace and tension of the film as it moves toward an intense climax.  But while one can--and many do--admire the film purely at this level, there is quite a lot going on in terms of philosophical content as well: while it offers few viable solutions, the film raises such issues as the relationship between capital and labor, the place of religion in modern society, human reaction to overwhelming technology, and (perhaps most interestingly) the drift of government into a class-conscious corporate entity.  And religious motifs abound in the film: a largely deserted cathedral; Moloch; the Tower of Babel; and crosses--intriguingly juxtaposed with a repeating motif of the pentagram-like designs associated with the robot.  It is fascinating stuff.

There has been complaint that this restoration runs at incorrect speed and the performances are therefore unnecessarily jerky.  I did not find this to be the case.  In certain instances the movement is deliberately jerky and mechanical--the workers are a case in point--but beyond this there is nothing for which the difference between silent acting and modern acting techniques cannot account.  There has also been some complaint that the title cards should have been left in their original German and translated via subtitle.  There is a certain validity to this, but it seems a minor quibble; title cards were typically translated in the silent era itself.  The DVD includes a number of extras, including still photographs, biographies of the major figures involved in the film, and two interesting documentaries-one on the restoration process and one on the creation of the film itself.  Both are interesting; the audio commentary track by film historian Enno Patalas, however, is mildly disappointing.  But when all is said and done, it is the film that counts.  And this restoration is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, a project which brings a great landmark of world cinema back from the edge of the abyss.  Indispensible; a must-own.

Well, it wasn't just more complete, it was almost completely different!  My eyes popped out and my jaw droppped as I saw this release for the first time.

I always assumed that the older version was just an indication of the overall production quality of the theatrical release, compounded with the problems with long term storage and that there wouldn't be much of an improvement in quality.  All I expected were a few additional scenes and perhaps a slighly cleaner picture.  How wrong could I be!
The picture is extremely sharp.  It's hard to believe the earlier releases were from the same film.

Every scrap, fragment, and sliver of extant film was used in restoring this film-as best as humanly possible-back to Fritz Lang's original vision.  Due to the age and ""silent artillery of time,"" I imagine that this will be as bet as we will ever get.
As it stands, film rounds out the st5roy that was sonly seen in sketch and shadow with previous versions,. including Giorgio Moroder's ""colorful"" 1984 adaptation.  This version expands upon the rivalry between Rotwang and Joh Fredersen, which was obliterated during the American Editing phase of the film.  ""Slim"" is given a bigger role.  We are also introduced to a previously unknown (and still unseen) Cathedral monk who warned Freder about the coming Apocalypse.  In fact, the entire movie takes on a greater religious and biblical tone, especially as we see Futura sit upon the beast with  seven heads during her Yoshiwara's dance scene.  The greatest surprises were with Worker #11811 and Josaphat.  These men get more screen time and they actually become people and are not longer part of the scenery.  But this is the point of the film-to see it as Lang envisioned it.
This has a good transfer, especially if all you have seen were the ""Bargain Barrel"" versions that look like they were done by monkeys.  The picture is mostly clean, but there are scratches, hairs, and blurs here and there.  I have seen better restorations, such as Disney's Snow White, or Orson Welles's  Othello.  I realize that budgets are always limited, and so I would choose to see bad missing film over good film I already have seen.  There is no reason why we cannot have anther version that is an improvement over this one, and if we buy A LOT of copies of this film, they studios would be more inclined to spend the money to perfect the transfer and quality.
I was surprised to see how the dealt with the missing scenes.  They had summaries written and flashed on the screen like inter-titles or address cards.  I approve of this choice where there are no stills, but if there are stills or even sketches, I would have preferred seeing these, since you are looking at something.  This is a movie, and we want to SEE things, not read about them.
For example, in this film, we just read about Worker #11811 going to Yoshiwara's, but in  Giorgio Moroder's version, we saw a still of the scene pan across the scnee, then another still of the entrance to Yoshiwara's
Similarly, the sequence with the bust of Hel could have been improved  The film is forever gone, so they used stills and cards to fill in the sequence.  In Giorgio Moroder's version, they used a different picture which looked better than the one used in this restored version.  Later in the film, when Rotwang recovers from fighting with Maria and wanders out in a trance, he makes a stop before the bust of Hel, then thinks Maria is Hel.  They have this still of someone with outstretched arms in front of the bust (praying?), and this could have been integrated in the film.  Once again, this film is visual, so I would prefer to look at something-even if it is not moving-rather than reading about something.  Always use an image over words!
By the way, why hasn't Moroder's ""colorful"" version been released to DVD?  This is the version of Metropolis that I grew up on, and you cannot argue with the soundtrack.  Hopefully, this new version of the film will spur the rights-holders to release Moroder's version to compete with this version.  I'd own both.
I love this film.  I think is is the most important sci-fi film ever made.  It was the first big-budget sci-fi film made.  It had a mythic core that does not let you go.  It has incredible story telling.  Even the editorial butcher job could not destroy this film.  After 75 years we are still watching this film, and it's no surprise why.",1051574400,9,3844,4.654302670623146
956248,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis has been one of the most abused films of all time.  Immediately after its debut in 1927, about a quarter of the film's reels were removed (and lost).  Since then, the film has been re-edited multiple times, to the point that some earlier editions were more or less incoherent.
The story of Metropolis is a bit simple and  bit convoluted at the same time, but more or less it is about the battle of the individual against a monolithic, totalitarian technological future.  I suspect the original plot was meant as a metaphor for industrial labor and social unrest in the 1920's.  In this way, Metropolis is a battle of the individual against the excesses of the industrial revolution.
That said, the real reason the film has endured despite multiple mutilations is that incredibly innovative film making.  The film was state of the art, and indeed has been a foundation for many modern science fiction films since.  In this regard, it is perhaps the real triumph of 1920's German Expressionist cinema.
The Kino release dvd is a real treat.  The restoration is near perfect, much better than I expected.  The film looks like a retored film from the 1950's, not from the 1920's.  Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation, the people responsible for the restoration, went frame by frame and restored the film to as close to its original as possible.  Of course, many sequences are still missing, possibly forever.  To solve this problem, intertitles were inserted to describe the missing plot sequences.  Finally, the film is coherent.
There is some dispute as to the running time of the film.  Running time is listed as 124 minutes but is in fact 118.  The German release of the film IS 124 minutes, and most of the material I have read states that this is the correct running time.  The Kino disk has a frame rate slightly higher than it should be, and the result is that a few scenes do look like the motion is too fast.  As I said, there is some debate about this...  I have heard also that Kino has the correct frame rate.  That being said, most of the material disputes this.
In any case, the Kino editon is the best the film has looked in years, and certainly the most coherent edition any of us have probably seen.  Great care has been taken to restore both the physical condition of the picture and the plot line, and the result is spectacular.  Metropolis was state of the art film making at its best, and it still impresses.",1050451200,14,2446,4.641860465116279
956249,5,6305013578,"This is the only version of this movie I have seen, so I can't compare it to previous releases or discuss the comparative quality of the DVD, etc.  I can, however, share my impressions of the movie itself.  In fact, to even call this extraordinary work of art a movie is like calling the Mona Lisa a picture.
This was the first silent movie I had ever watched (certainly won't be the last), and I watched it after reading some very interesting reviews of the film's artistry and importance.  To say I was not disappointed is an understatement.
The ""feel"" of the movie is somewhat similar to that of Blade Runner, a dark, futuristic world.  However, I have seen Blade Runner twice, many years ago, and I can only remember a few vague things about it (unfortunately the plot is not one of them).  But there is no doubt in my mind that the story and the images of Metropolis are burned into my memory with almost eerie permanence.  It was very, very far ahead of its time, in both story and scope.  In fact, if someone had told me that it was a modern movie purporting to be a 1927 silent movie I would have believed it hook, line, and sinker.  But my response would have been - 1927?  Impossible!  It is no wonder that Metropolis is required viewing for film students.  There is no doubt in my mind that it has influenced or directly inspired every science fiction film ever made.
Plot: Fascinating, easy enough to follow even when it doesn't always make complete sense.  (But then with one quarter of the movie tragically lost forever, it's a wonder it makes sense at all.)
Acting: Truly a joy - the actors, since they had no dialogue to fall back on, had to convey the story and move along the plot through facial expressions and gestures, and they succeeded magnificently.  Acting has come a long way, but the over-the-top acting style of the era adds to the movie's incredible charm.
Score: Magnificent.  I have not seen the 80's version with the heavy metal score, so I apologize if I offend its fans, but I absolutely can't imagine this film with any other but the original score.  It is perfect.  To replace the score with anything else would be giving the viewers only half the experience.
Artistry: Simply unbelievable.  The details are immaculate.  Watching the workers on the M machine move in rhythm to the music like a choreographed dance was an impression I will never forget, and how the mob that approached the gothic church at the end was arranged in a perfectly symmetrical pyramid.  The extraordinary art deco beauty of the Machine Man, the towering city, the intricate machines, all of it was simply fantastic (in the literal sense).  I have never seen anything so utterly captivating to watch.
The DVD quality does seem extraordinary, but again I have nothing to compare it to.  The picture was as clear as if it had been filmed yesterday.  The only disappointment - and it is a grave and tragic one - is not being able to see the fourth that was lost.
Very, very highly recommended, especially for fans of science fiction, the arts, architecture, the art deco period, silent films, classic films, special effects, film history ... well, you get the idea.",1050278400,9,3174,4.600355239786857
956250,5,6305013578,"Fritz Lang's spectacular, gargantuan and visionary METROPOLIS has been seen for over 75 years but only in edited editions.
Now, digitally restored under the supervision of the Murnau Foundation, here is the most complete version ever. With the addition of the sometimes Wagneresque 1927 orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz, Metropolis can finally be enjoyed in its full  eye-popping glory.  The story takes place in 2026 (hey, not so far off), when the class differences of the human race are dramatically divided between poor laborers who live underground in dark warrens and labyrinths and the rich who live above in the light of towering, futuristic splendor.
The truly iconic images in this movie -- as famous as any in the 20th century -- have profoundly influenced the sets, ideas, props and themes in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner and even Star Wars.  A. O. Scott of the New York Times rightly called Metropolis ""A fever dream of the future.""  This version is over one third longer than any previous release and is by far the most complete since its Berlin premier
Worthwhile extras include a fine commentary by film historian Enno Patalas, great 5.1 surround sound of the  newly recorded orchestral score, ""The Metropolis Case"": a wonderful 43-minute documentary, Photo Galleries of production stills, fascinating missing scenes, striking architectural sketches, posters and more.

956251,3,6305013578,"Because others have already done so, I won't elaborate on the film's visual enhancements (I agree it was an excellent tranfer to DVD with the same caveats used by other reviewers).  However, I'm baffled by the fact no one apparently wants to go out on a limb and call this what it is - union propaganda.  Could ""Management"" be portrayed in a more sinister light?  Could the workers have been portrayed in a more drudgelike, hang-dog fashion (or did they seem like the Israelites were portrayed while enslaved in Egypt)? Essentially the workers were awaiting their Messiah - in this case the ""Mediator"" (make that union boss Freder) and finally got their Mediator after the boss's son was smitten by the ""Union Organizer"" Maria (or Mary much like Mary the Virgin gives birth to Jesus, so Maria essentially gives birth to the Messiah (i.e., union boss Freder).  And the fact that technology (i.e., the ""Evil Maria"" that is the robot changed physically by the mad scientist Rotwang to resemble Maria) leads/incites the union people to commit horrible and stupid acts (much like the character in the Ten Commandments movie that incites the Israelites that followed Moses to behave poorly while Moses was away getting the Ten Commandments) was equally appalling.  I could go on but you get the drift.",1049846400,2,1295,4.894977168949771
956300,3,6305013578,"Let me start by saying that a movie of this stature can't be praised highly enough. Having said that I beg to differ with all the five star rave reviews concerning the DVD transfer. I'm quite the Metropolis fan and my toes curled when I saw that the newest and latest official release has its intertitles translated into English up to the point of actually changing the original images as well.(The address card Freder shows Josaphas, the Hel memorial plaque, the tower of Babel sequence, a business card picked up by Freder, etc, are all English translations inserted by digital or other means into the film.) So, claiming that this version is original is dubious to say the least. Why not benefit from DVD's technology to leave it up to the viewer to choose between the (original) German or English intertitles? If it can be done with subtitles, I'm sure intertitles can't pose a problem. Imagine the frustration of the German movie buffs who have to watch one of their greatest movies of all time with English intertitles and German subtitles! What really made me frown is that in the scene selection section on the DVD you can make out the original German intertitles in some of the preview windows! The frustrating part about this is that even when using DVD's technological advantages to choose between intertitles, changes made onto the print by substituting English text over the images are permanent.
Furthermore I challenge any film technician or any of the members on the restauration team of the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation to tell me that this version of Metropolis is transfered at the correct speed. And by that I mean the speed at which any normal human being walks, runs and can gesticulate without looking like an episode from Comedy Capers. Have a look at the final scene where Rotwang chases Maria up the Cathedral. It is actually comical and embarassing to see, taking into account the enormous effort the F.W.M. Foundation took in restoring this monument. Trust me, you don't have to be an animation student or an expert in locomotion to see that the actor's movements are sped up. Even the big clock's second hand in Frederson's office races by at exaggerated speed. When Joh Frederson stands opposite of Rotwang (Hal statue sequence), Rotwang waves his hands frenetically in Fredersen's face to gesticulate refusal. For a moment his hands elude me because of motional blur. Eureka's 1999 release of Metropolis had much better and natural movement of the actors. What very few people know is that Fritz Lang under-crancked the camera for some of the shots in his movie to add drama and weight to some scenes. These little moments of genius gave Metropolis some of its extraordinary atmosphere and appeal and are now completely lost with this release.
In 1927 the German production company UFA ordered the film to be cut for the US release. The American editor charged with this operation also exchanged the German intertitles and scenes with German texts for English substitutes. It's an irony that this release has been labeled ""Restored Authorized Edition"" for it perpetuates the act of defacing the original print as the editor did in 1927. The claim Kino makes this being a restored edition is at least misleading. Apart from footage that must be considered permanently lost, the claim holds no truth. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines ""restore"" as: ""To put or bring back into a former or original state."" Metropolis is a German movie. It used German text and titles. So let's get over the five star rave and try to be at least a little critical. I mean we're talking about one of the most influential and monumental movies of all time. Too bad its fantastic restauration is marred by such obvious flaws.
My first copy of Metropolis was Eureka's 1999 release which runs at 139 minutes on region 2 equipment. Although the image suffers from a very bad transfer and even more missing footage in comparison with this release, it is so much more the viewing experience you want and ultimately can't forget. Speeding up a film destroys the director's artistical vision together with the movies ambience and atmosphere. Needless to say I immediately returned my recently acquired Restored Authorized Edition for a refund.",1049500800,264,4255,4.919332406119611
956301,5,6305013578,"I'll assume you've seen STAR WARS, or at least you're familiar with it. Suppose that STAR WARS was available only in a severly mutilated version shortened by a quarter, omitting key plot elements regarding the relationship of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Obi Wan Kenobi. Then for whatever reason portions of the dialog were rewritten, redubbed and the John Williams score was replaced with generic classical selections, or perhaps a contemporary rock score. To add insult to injury, let's suppose that even this mutilated version is only seen in blurry, faded and sometimes unwatchable prints. Well, that's precisely the treatment that Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS has received over the years. The new restoration gives fans of science fiction film, silent film, german expressionist film, classic film music and the magic of the cinema reason to rejoice! Though, sadly, the portions which were cut seem to be irretrievable, the remaining elements have been restored using state-of the art techniques and re-edited into their proper sequence with the original title cards. The results are accompanied by the stirring score prepared for the film's premiere in the 1920's and the final presentation is nothing short of breathtaking.

As others have noted the trasfer is terrible, the music is good but sound quality is terrible too. Having watched this version of Metropolis I was able to get some kind of plot out of it and even with the poor film transfer the imagry is at times stunning.
Here's my advice; if you just have to see Metropolis and do not want to pay the substantially high price of the Kino version buy this copy, but understand...and please take my word on this as I'm one of the people that made a similar decision, know that you are getting poor quality all around.
Whether this will ruin the film's experience for you has more to do with your aesthetics. Metropolis has major historical importance and watching it I could see where other favorite dystopian films liberally borrowed ideas. In the end it was acceptable for the price I paid. I would not buy this new and would cough up the extra money and get the Kino version if buying it new. I will be purchasing the latest DVD eventually just to be able to enjoy the superior quality.
5 stars for the film being wonderful 0 stars for the quality. The average would be 2.5 and although it's a great film Metropolis is gutted by this poor DVD. When reading reviews it is easy to take it personal, that a poor review of the DVD (a product) in some way says something negative towards the film on it. In this review the quality of the film is the only reason more than one star was given.
My last parting shot...
The reason I even bothered with the Mandacy product was because so many negative reviews on Amazon have been baseless or inane one line insults I have become numb to them. Take it from a usually easy to please reviewer. Stay away from this DVD.",1047859200,9,1918,4.390449438202247

956309,5,6305013578,"I've read over the reviews given here, after having viewed my own copy of this DVD, and must agree with all of you.  This version is really stunningly fine, and a must-buy for anyone at all interested in the history of film, and in quality cinema in general.

My first experience of Metropolis was seeing the usual truncated version in a little community cinema in San Francisco some 23 years ago.  The musical accompaniment was improvised brilliantly on the piano by an old friend of mine who had seen the original film in Germany as a teenager!  It was an unforgettable experience.  I especially remember as I greeted him at half-time him saying (probably about the actor who played Freder), ""oh, that one actor is a real Westphalian ham!  It's really hard to keep up with him!""

Anyway... this restored version is a great revelation for me.  As a composer myself, and one who has been studying silent film music lately, seeing this film restored with the music originally written for it is hugely rewarding.  The score is well-written, and perfectly carries across the film-maker's intentions, in a style in keeping with that of the film.  It is a model of good silent-film music, worthy of study.  It points up all the more how problematic it is when silents are released without proper music (e.g. the DVD of Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"", with a bunch of spliced-together extracts of Shostokovitch symphonies:  fine music, but often incongruous with the film;  a CD now exists of the original music by Edmund Meisel -- when will someone finally match this with the movie for a true restoration?).

Besides the music, the visual restoration is truly magnificent, often breathtaking in its beauty.  Would that all great silent films could get this treatment (but the cost would be astronomical)!

As to speed:  actually, there's reference in the DVD (or its booklet, I forget) to the original speed being 25 frames-per-second, which is pretty close to the modern 24 fps.  But the action does sometimes look a little frantic, so I wonder about the 20 fps theory...  If so, that's about the only flaw in this production.

956370,5,6305013578,"Ok, by now I assume you know what Metropolis is about, so let's go to the juicy parts: You want to know how it looks and how it rates to other versions.
First of all, the one thing you will notice inmediatelly is that the quality of this DVD is *OUTSTANDING* (when considering this is a 1927 movie). The digital wizards that restored the film not only got rid of the scratches, they actually went all the way and instead of using an automated process to restore the film they went BY HAND frame by frame and fixed all imperfections. They fixed the grainnes, the contrast, AND the shaking (common to old film). The film almost looks like if it was recently shot with a black and white camera, it is THAT good. They even went further and when they combined many reels from different sources into one scene they actually fixed the images on both reels so that you don't notice the difference between then (i.e.: the transitions occur seamlessly).
You can find out about all this in the included documentary on the restoration. They even mention that such a painstaking and expensive process is not used in most films, but due to the importance of Metropolis they went all the way.
I also recommend you read the small booklet included which has even more information.
As for the story, I have to admit that I was completely surprised. The movie now makes sense!!! For example, in previous ""mutilated"" versions of Metropolis, we were all told to believe that the robot was created to control the masses. Now we learn though that in the original film, the robot is really the creation of a scientist whose wife dies, and thus he tries to recreate her again.
Also note one quarter of the film is still missing (sadly, very likely forever), but thanks to deep research they restoration team actually found out what was missing, and for those missing scenes they include special ""title cards"" that explain in text what's missing when (when you watch the movie this does not distract you, since it feels that the titles are part of the movie, this being a silent film after all).
Also, you will find TONS of scenes you very likely never saw before in any previous version, and this also makes the film feel ""complete"". You will also be amazed at the grandeur of some of such scenes, giving any modern ""monumental"" movie a true run for their money. This also has to be said about the special effects, which in many cases hold up pretty fine even in today's age of digital wizzardly.
As for the soundtrack: WOW. Now finally the soundtrack follows the action on the screen!!! They actually went back and restored the original soundtrack and used the original written clues in the soundtrack notes to find out what went where. Now everything feels much more in place and the music sets the mood in many scenes, making the movie much more enjoyable.
Let me summarize this by saying that after watching this Kino Version of Metropolis, I went RIGHT AWAY and dispossed in the garbage of all my other Metropolis versions.
All I can say is that this is a true labor of love, and that my deepest humble thanks go to the team that did this restoration. If I were one of them, I'd be extremelly proud for acchieving something many thought impossible. It finally makes justice over 75 years later to an amazingly great film, very likely the film ""that started it all"" when it comes to science fiction and many other genres (I can see 2001-A Space Oddisey, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Terminator, and the Matrix all being directly and heavily influenced by this film).",1046476800,9,3541,4.6044303797468356

All I can say about the restoration is WOW! The visuals are incredible, and there is now enough original footage that the story makes sense.
For it's history and pioneering visual effects, this is an absolute must-have for any film buff.",1046217600,,493,4.428571428571429
956375,4,6305013578,"This DVD restored version is the best version of this classic movie that this reviewer has seen.  It does has its good and not so good points, but what doesn't?
Firstly the picture transfer and restoration can be considered a success.  I compared this version to the Laserdisc Moroder(spelling?) version.  My conclusions are that the reduction in the frame rate speed and the inclusion of additional footage make this DVD preferrable.  Whether or not the film was shown with color tints,  I definitely think that this film works better with the tinting, which adds to the the effect of having two separate worlds - that of the workers and that of the elite who inhabit the surface.
The frame speed as played back here has been controversal.  I tried several experiments using the variable playback speed.  At 20 frames per second the action is still not true to life.  One has to get to .65X to make it so.  This speed would be the most preferrable.  The audio, however, does suffer at these reduced speeds.
The audio is  a disappointment.  The score adds little value to this film.  I felt myself not being drawn in emotionally as much as with the Moroder version.  In this case - and I may be in the minority here - I think that a modern (read pop or rock)score, in particular the Moroder score works much better than the classical score, after all it is a futuristic vision we are being shown.  Also, Moroder's use of silence and sound effects are much more effective and at times stunning.
The most useless part of this new release is the commentary.  Granted I did not hear it all but what I heard was someone describing what they thought the religious symbolism was during a  scene.  This was, in my opinion, not appropriate.  This is only someone's impression or opinion.  Commentary on *how* the film was made or what happened during the shot is what should be the commentary subject.
I'm glad I bought this for the study but I'm keeping my Moroder version for the impact.",1046131200,3,1980,4.602857142857143

**2/24/03: REVIEW OF 2003 KINO ""METROPOLIS"" DVD (ASIN: B00007L4MJ)

I'm lumping my reviews together, just like what Amazon is doing!  The above 4 video editions of the German silent classic will be covered in this review.  Also, see my video clip on the left to see  disc covers, film clip comparisons, etc.  (Those who can't see my video clip, especially iOS users who can't see flash video, please go to Amazon's FULL site and look under my review for the comment section, where I posted an external link to the video.)

Released in 1927, amid the golden age of the silent film era, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is a stylistic tour-de-force that has remained influential for the rest of the century, inspiring films from ""Frankenstein"" in 1931, ""Bladerunner"" in 1982, to ""Dark City"" in 1997. With its imaginative set design, elaborate photography, bold editing, and its then groundbreaking special effects, this German sci-fi silent classic exemplifies the highly inventive period of German Expressionism, which also include such film masterworks as ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligaru"", ""Nosferatu"", ""The Last Laugh"", and Lang's ""Die Nibelungen"".

In 2011, Kino released the 1984 ""Giorgio Moroder"" version of the classic on Blu-ray and DVD.  This version controversially contains a rock score accompaniment which, to many people, myself included, is quite inappropriate for the film.  Moroder, a record producer and an Oscar-winning songwriter (""Take My Breath Away"", ""Flashdance... What a Feeling""), deserves credit for restoring the previously butchered film to a presentable 82-minute version, but he added a few butcherings of his own.  Intertitles were replaced with subtitles.  Additional special effects were added.  And instead of a traditional score, Moroder naturally used what he knew best: a pop rock score with pop rhythm and beats that don't really mesh with the images.  His score is not just intrumental, but it comprises of fully-written songs sung by Pat Benatar, Freddie Mercury, and others, essentially turning the film into one big music video.  What Moroder didn't understand was that in a music video, the song is the centerpiece; but in a film, the IMAGE has to be the center.  A piece of film has its own rhythm and beats too.  Every cut, motion, close-up, etc, gives the image its rhythm, which Moroder has to understand is not always four-quarter time.  There are a few instrumental passages in the score, and they fare better and are less detrimental to the flow of the images.  But most of the score are songs.  The chapter listing shows the song titles and artists' names, but no subtitles are offered for the lyrics.  The quality of the songs vary, with Benatar's ""Here's My Heart"" seemingly the most effective, showing that Moroder at least paid attention to the movie's theme about the heart being the mediator in any struggle.  The picture quality is presentable, but Kino makes it clear on the back cover that this is an unrestored, straight transfer from an old print.  The Blu-ray does not look as good as other Blu-ray editions.  There are a fair amount of print damages and the picture looks a bit dark at times.  But the details of the high-def 1080p picture does come through, making this Blu-ray the best-looking edition of Moroder's Metropolis.  The score is offered in lossless DTS 5.1 on the Blu-ray (Dolby 5.1 on the DVD) and it sounds fine.  The Blu-ray also offers a lossless LPCM stereo track for those with legacy equipments.  Bonus features include a 17-minute documentary (in English with no subtitles) that provides a cursory coverage of the German silent film history, the history of ""Metroplis"", and Moroder's restoration.  Two trailers and 11 high-quality scans of publicity stills are also included.

Currently, the ""go-to"" version of the Lang classic is the 2010 Kino Region-A Blu-ray edition and its corresponding Region-1 DVD edition.  They are titled ""The Complete Metropolis"" to avoid confusion with other editions.  They contain, to date, the most complete, two-and-a-half-hour cut of the film, combining the two-hour version from the monumental 2001 restoration effort by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation (previously released as the 2003 Kino DVD), and about half-hour of footage discovered at Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2008 that had been unseen for decades. This previously lost footage has been edited back into the film to create this new ""Complete Metropolis"" edition. The added scenes are sprinkled all over the film, improving continuity, clarifying storytelling, and thus heightening the impact and yielding a result that is greater than the sum of its parts, as they finally restore Lang's full vision to its near complete form.

The HD picture quality of the Blu-ray ranges from sparklingly clear in some footage, slightly softer in others (especially the special fx shots), to severely battered and damaged as in those newly-discovered shots.  All the ""good-looking"" footage came from the 2001 restoration.  With the upgrade to HD, the sharpness and the clarity over the DVD counterpart is readily apparent, and therefore this Blu-ray represents the best that the film has ever looked on home video.  Unfortunately, the half hour of new-found footage, originated from 16mm film, looks severely damaged and sometimes barely watchable, and it doesn't benefit much from the HD picture.  As the new footage is sprinkled all over the film, the picture quality oscillates between good and bad, normally an uncomfortable experience but a small price to pay for finally watching the most complete version yet of the classic.

The Blu-ray disc contains a lossless DTS 5.1 audio track of the original orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by Berlin's Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra.  Many people would have preferred the newly-composed score by the Alloy Orchestra, who have actually toured North America with their excellent live accompaniment of the complete ""Metropolis"".  I contacted Alloy Orchestra and they said the German distributors would not allow Kino to use their score on the new edition.  Thus, Alloy Orchestra is selling their score on a CD disc, albeit in lossy MP3 format with only a 192 kbps bit rate.  Google ""alloy metropolis order"" to order it.

The intertitles for the 2010 Kino edition, just like in the 2003 edition, are in English only.  Whenever there is on-screen German text, English subtitles are provided and not removable.

If you are a purist who wants to see original German intertitles, the same thing German audiences saw back in 1927, you need to get the British Region-B ""Masters of Cinema"" Blu-ray or its corresponding Region-2 DVD edition by Eureka, titled ""Metropolis"".  They can be ordered at Amazon UK.  North American viewers would need a multi-region player to play Region-B or 2 discs, however.  The intertitles on these discs are in German only and supported by optional English subtitles.

Supplements on Kino's 2010 edition do not contain any from the 2003 edition (so save that disc).  Instead, we have a pretty good 50-minute documentary titled ""Voyage to Metropolis"", shown in HD on the Blu-ray and narrated in German with optional English subtitles, about the dramatic history of ""Metropolis"" up to its re-discovery in Argentina.

The TCM channel has also broadcast another excellent, 50-min documentary on the same subject titled ""Metropolis Refound"", but it is not available on any home video.

The Eureka Region-B Blu-ray's HD picture quality is virtually identical to the Kino Blu-ray edition.  Both editions have the same Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra score in lossless DTS.  Both have the ""Voyage to Metropolis"" documentary (shown in HD on Blu-ray).  The Eureka disc also contains an excellent full-length audio commentary by David Kalat and Jonathan Rosenbaum, while the Kino disc has a 9-minute interview with Paula Felix-Didier, curator of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires.  The Eureka disc also comes with a 56-page booklet of essays, interviews, and restoration notes.

**BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE KINO 2003 DVD EDITION, originally posted Feb-24-2003**

This Kino Region 1-only DVD offers an almost pristine-looking video transfer of the film. The untinted, black-and-white image is clean and sharp throughout, the result of a mostly manual frame-by-frame restoration started in 1998 by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation. The included jacket essay gives a brief account of its efforts, as well as the work of other restorationists in the past, notably Munich Filmmuseum and film historian Enno Patalas. The DVD supplements also include an excellent mini-documentary that explains some of the technical details in the restoration.

The film's running time on this DVD is 118 minutes (not 124 as printed on the case). It is shown at the speed of 24 frames per second, an unusual frame rate for a silent film. But according to F.W. Murnau Foundation, this was the projection speed used at the film's premiere in 1927. Some viewers may find the motion a bit too fast at times due to the high frame rate. But some believe this was director Fritz Lang's way to intensify some of the action. (For those who want to watch METROPOLIS at a slower speed, there is a PC DVD player called WinDVD 4.0, which lets you extend or shorten a DVD's running time without affecting the pitch of the audio.)

This DVD only has English intertitles (supported by French and Spanish subtitles). The style, typeface, and the occasional animation in the intertitles were all re-created according to the original film. The original score by Gottfried Huppertz was also ""adapted"" from its 153-minute original length to the current, shorter length. This is the first time I have a chance to listen to Huppertz's elaborately orchestrated score, and it sounds terrific.

This latest restoration, unfortunately, did not recover a lot of film footage that had been missing over the years. Major sequences that were lost, such as Maria's escape from Rotwang, are still lost. To make up for this, and to make the film's plot more coherent, new intertitles were inserted to summarize the story lines of the missing footage. These intertitles are frequently seen in this restored version, a constant reminder of the large amount (a quarter of the film) of lost footage.

I did a brief side-by-side comparison between the Kino DVD and a few old video versions, and discovered the DVD actually has ""alternate scenes"" that were utilized for this restoration. In other words, Lang apparently shot some of the scenes *twice* (probably for domestic theaters and abroad), resulting in two versions of a scene looking slightly different. For instance, in the running competition early in the film, the winner wins by a bigger distance in all older video versions that I have seen than he does on the Kino DVD.

The DVD's audio commentary by Enno Patalas is mild disappointment. As in the Kino DVD of THE BLUE ANGEL, the comments are too sparse and not too in-depth. And long stretches of silence are frequent. The commentary is largely analytical, and it points out some of the key themes and visual motifs of the film.

The other DVD supplements include an involving 45-minute documentary that covers the making of the film, the German Expressionist period, the ""unmaking"" of METROPOLIS by censors and Hollywood, and a few interview segments of Lang. The still gallery contains about 90 production photos and design sketches, including about 27 photos taken from missing scenes.",1046044800,344,12194,5.313899010931807
956377,5,6305013578,"I might not have quite the same emotions about this as the folks at the Mernau Institute when they first realized that the Argentines had indeed come up with a genuinely complete version of this masterwork, but tonight I remain quite moved by both the grace of the complete film and the satisfaction of finally witnessing the culmination of an exhaustive decades long search.

The version that Kino distributed a few years ago did a great job suggesting the added complexity of the original work, and there are no ""new"" scenes presented that greatly change the thrust of the story.  But the power of the story, and the sophisticated interplay of all the characters as originally conceived is quite stunning.  Some of the new shots reinforce those we are familiar with.  Others give us hypnotizing glimpses into the darker aspects that the original american cut sought to negate.

I might caution that the first newly discovered footage doesn't start appearing until nearly a half hour into it, but from the point where the monument to a woman who was wife, mother, and assumedly lover, of the three male leads is revealed, the story surely inherits a primal underpinning that I never experienced in any prior viewing.  The new footage then continues to reveal and refine the intricacies that nudge this from broad parable to a more intimate connection with the viewer.

To those who have longed to experience the complete Metropolis, your time has come.",1046044800,5,1453,4.906122448979592
956378,5,6305013578,"At last, the ""Metropolis"" film restoration project is complete, and the results are brilliant. One of the greatest and most influential science fiction films in history has been rescued from oblivion, and now it can survive in digital glory to amaze and capture the imaginations of future generations.
The first time I purchased a DVD of this film, it was the ""Hollywood Classics"" version, and I was so terribly disappointed by the scratchy print that I could hardly get past the first 20 minutes, and ultimately I donated the disc to my local public library. Sure, I knew that surviving prints of ""Metropolis"" had deteriorated badly, but I had assumed in the age of the DVD that something watchable would be available. The ""Hollywood Classics"" version is NOT watchable.
But now the definitive version is out, and it's FANTASTIC. I suspect most people who purchase this disc are already familiar with the film and venerate it like I do. But there's much more to recommend this DVD than just the fact that the film has been digitally restored as closely to the version that originally premiered in Berlin in 1927. The extras on this disc are amazing. You'll want to pore over the extensive photo galleries. You'll also enjoy the ""Metropolis Case"" documentary about Fritz Lang and the place of the film in German Expressionist film history. The short feature about how the film was digitally cleaned up is also interesting, though a bit academic.
But when you finally decide to settle in and watch the film itself, I would highly suggest watching it with the excellent commentary by Enno Patalas ON. It's very well-scripted and provides the film with a great deal of extra meaning and resonance. You've already seen the film a number of times, right? You'll enjoy the commentary, trust me. It doesn't distract from the viewing experience, nor is it like commentary tracks today in which cast and crew watch the film and just throw in offhand observations and an occasional chuckle. Enno Patalas' commentary in contrast is well-paced and highly respectful of both the film and the viewer.",1045958400,16,2085,4.909348441926346
956379,5,6305013578,"There are many things that make this version great, but I will mention only 3.
1. The film is painstakingly restored to (probably) the cleanest graphics since 1927 in Berlin (if even then). Gone is the graininess, dirt, smudges, water spots, and scenes that are too light, or too dark. According to the restoration documentary, many of the scenes were restored frame by frame. WOW. What a labor of love. Keep in mind that 1/4 of the film is gone forever, so...
2. The original script is used. This film has probably been the most butchered, massacred, botched, and misrepresented script ever. The 45 minute documentary that comes with the DVD explains why. What Keno did is use the original script, scenes that were gone forever were told via a storyboard (which makes this version probably the most coherant Metropolis ever). Example: If you watch the cheap PD production of Metropolis, it makes Rotwang look like a faithful servant of Joh Fredersen, whereas the Kino version not only shows that Rotwang dispises Fredersen, but why (It seems that they shared the same woman, named Hel (another fact not mentioned in all other versions). She was originally Rotwang's girl, but was lured away by Fredersen. She dies giving birth to Freder). There are many other small scenes that make the film look like a different, better & more complete movie.
3. It has the original 1927 Orchestral Score. All the other versions of this film have background music (lets see... The Media version is the same music over and over again. The Platnum version is mood music from standard classical music which abruptly changes when the scene changes. The Georgio Moroder one (which would probably be the lowest rated for tackiness alone) plays Dat Ol' Time Rock 'n' Roll). It is so refreshing not only to hear the original score (of course, newly recorded), but to be able to hear it in dolby 5.1 surround.
The only thing left to ask yourself is this. What do I do with my old cheap version? The only answer I can come up with is that fortunately, the cheap disk is still round and therefore has the perfect shape for skeet shooting.
If you've never purchased Metropolis, this is the one to get. This one may cost more, but is proof (just like many Criterion releases) that you get what you pay for.
Kudos to Kino, and Transit Films.",1045872000,17,2313,4.713580246913581
956457,5,6305013578,"I had only seen inferior prints of this classic up til now. I am more than pleased with this edition. It looks and sounds fantastic. I was finally able to fully comprehend the story. When anything is done that requires great effort, there are always those who are never satisfied---as evidenced by some of the reviews. But everyone has their personal preference. I am amazed at the care and painstaking detail with which ""Metropolis"" has been handled here. It's worth every penny to invest in it as the collectors' item it is. Some missing scenes have been replaced with title cards to bridge the gaps but this is a small issue compared with the whole of what is there. The unforgettable images and scenes of the underground machine workers as well as the creation of the robot ""Maria"" are just beautiful and pristine in quality. The erotic dance scene with the robot Maria is nothing short of eye-popping---considering this was 1927. But it's the timeless message of the film that lingers also...""the mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart"". What a beautiful statement. The heart is there in this restoration and it shows. After the debacle of ""Day of the Triffids"", it's good to know that someone still cares about quality. To me, this version of ""Metropolis"" is all that and then some.",1045699200,6,1307,4.762114537444934
956458,5,6305013578,"I purchased this film in advance when I saw the preview on Kino's website.  It just came today, and I watched this version for the first time.  This is the film which made me fall in love with silent films.  My mother had an atrocious copy put out most likely by ""Goodtimes"" on vhs.  I saw it the first time in 1988, and it has enthralled me ever since.
The premise is basic; in the future, mankind is downtrodden by the brutal masters of industry.  Freder is the son of one such master, Joh Frederson, the master of Metropolis.  The sons of these masters are kept seperate from the workers, so they never see the devestation wrought by their fathers.  Freder, Joh's son, falls in love with a worker's daughter, Maria, who is a motivational speaker in secret meetings for the workers.  Freder, in his pursuit, discovers the brutal conditions the workers are subjected to, and sets against his father.  Joh goes to Rotwang, a mad scientist who creates a robot to look like Maria to foment revolution to help control the workers.
The story is actually very well done, but prior to this version nothing has been available at an adequate quality.  With this painstakingly preserved version, this beautiful film is seen once more as it was meant to be, or as close as possible given the available footage.  The restored film looks great, allowing a better print than many films half its age.  The restored music score is dazzling, and the production stills, 43 minute documentary, and many other relevant features are worth the admission fee.  If you like Sci Fi and/or silent films, this film is not only great, but necessary.",1045699200,4,1622,4.669014084507042
956459,5,6305013578,"I don't know what anyone else may claim, but personally, this is hands-down the cleanest, most brilliant transfer of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" that I have ever seen - indeed, it's the nicest 'print' of a silent film I have ever seen. This should set a new precedent in the industry of film restoration and the folks at Kino deserve my sincerest thanks. I never thought I'd ever see Metropolis look so good - (or sound so good).
The score is great! I love the soundtrack. In 5.1 Digital, you simply can't beat it. It's a wonderful piece of music too - goes with the immagery better than anything I've seen before. I've always liked the piano score by Robert E. Lee, but I think this ""new"" orchestral score works even better.
If you like Metropolis, you MUST get this DVD from Kino! If you like sci-fi, then you also MUST get this DVD.
Make sure you buy the version from Kino, and don't complain that it costs considerably more than the other versions on the market - it is WELL worth it, believe me! This 2002 restoration of Metropolis is a landmark in film history, and I am happy to be a part of it!",1045612800,19,1100,4.3707317073170735
956460,4,6305013578,"Per a lengthy review at DVD Talk, this DVD is at 24 fps because that apparently is how the movie was originally shown in the 1920s -- sometimes at 25 or 26 fps, likely because the movie was so long that the distributors feared they'd lose people, so they sped up the film to shorten the viewing time. The original score was made to go with the movie at 24 fps. So, this IS the original Metropolis -- at least as far as the first theatergoers saw it. But, as the DVD Talk reviewer notes, the movie definitely should be viewed at 20 fps. But this is the best we have for now, until someone spends the $$ to rescore it and re-DVD it at 20 fps.

956461,3,6305013578,"I saw the print this DVD is based on a few months ago at the Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis. Kino has done more than anyone before to restore this great film. However, there ARE problems. The original score, for instance, was not always in synch with the action on the screen. That is due, no doubt, to the fact that the film is still missing much of it's footage. Therefore, the placement of the soundtrack must have been guesswork. And, frankly, the music itself is a weak and dated element.

Why oh why did they do this? Speeding up the film. Kino toured the film at it's original 20 fps format at considerable inconvenience. Why they didn't just keep it faithful for the end product is beyond me. Keep it real!,1043884800,24,445,4.6455696202531644

956464,4,6305013578,"Despite what H.G. Wells, (a favorite author), writes about this film by Fritz Lang, (a favorite director), and understanding his disgruntled feelings, it is a masterwork. When one views Metropolis, one isn't looking at a sad-face clown portrait, but at a Renoir or Dali. This film is beautiful, with a poignant look at how society works. The robot Maria is indeed one of the most alluring robots ever to grace a film.
The story is well done, and the filming superb. The acting, as with most silent films, is very expressive. Keeping this in mind, the actors do an excellent job. In particular Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis is fantastic and plays his concern for his son against his despotic abuse of the workers. Thea Von Harbou, the author of the original book, unfortunately joined the Nazi party later on. In viewing Metropolis the film, it is obvious that Nazism was on the extreme opposite of its intention.
This DVD print is exceedingly disappointing, with many scenes washed out beyond recognition. Despite some fun extras and nice packaging, it just doesn't make up for the poor quality print. Fortunately, it has recently been restored and made available, which is a costlier version, but well worth the money.  If you'd prefer to not spend the money, this edition will serve you fine.  The film I give 5 stars, but this edition I give 1 star, which averages to a three overall, but I'll give the film another star, because it's great anyway, and that makes 4 stars.",1042156800,2,1485,4.77431906614786
956465,5,6305013578,"Arguably one of the most influential science-fiction movies of all time, the 2002 re-release of Fritz Lang's 1927 epic ""Metropolis"" was truly one of the miracles of modern times.  Not only had a generous amount of footage been re-integrated to the cut, but the entire film had been gloriously restored and the exisiting title cards re-translated from the original German.
""Metropolis"" tells the story of a massive city split in two: under the earth is the city of the workers, slaves to the 10-hour clock.  Their endless toil provides for the rulers of the upper world, a class of rich and indolent nobles.  In-between these worlds steps Maria, a beautiful worker that tells the workers that a mediator will come to join the city and that ""Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind.""  But her goal is not so easily reached, and a mad scientist, his villainous robot decoy, and a resistant upper class work against her.
Lang's vision is astounding, and the special effects are fantastically rendered for the time.  The film's production costs were so great, it almost bankrupt the studio.  The result is a fantastic blend of drama, allegory, romance, myth, and classic science-fiction.  The score is evocative like few others, and the newly restored film has a new recording of the original soundtrack.  While some of the footage is lost forever, title cards fill in the gaps, and this is the only thing the movie can be faulted for.
This is the ONLY version of the movie to own.  All others use an inferior print and some even tell an entirely different story.  Also, avoid the 1984 Georgio Moroder-scored version at all costs.

Currently there are a number of prints of this DVD out, but most of them utilize 16mm prints that are often grainy and blurry... which is NOT a good tribute to what is considered one of the greatest sci fi movies ever. The Kino video offers a beautiful soundtrack as well as a clear, near pristine 35mm print in its version.
The Kino version also contains a very thorough movie, which, once again, is absent in most prints. Weeks after METROPOLIS was shown, it was cut drastically. Kino has released the most- complete version to date, using footage that was from some of the cut to enhance and explain the story. Parts of the movie that have been lost, presumably forever, are explained through intertitles. The story makes much more sense and offers a great deal more depth now.

Unfortunately, I had never seen METROPOLIS until I bought this Madacy version of the movie. I bought the DVD for a whopping (Money). I knew that the quality was probably going to bad (I only paid (Money)), but I never expected it to be this bad. I wish I could have read some of the reviews here at Amazon first. Much of the printed narrative at the very beginning of the film is completely cut off the screen. The film is rather grainy and at points it is difficult to see anything on the screen. Also, there are several times throughout the movie that the film skips like a scratched record. My only positive comment about the film is that I did enjoy the musical score, it reminded me of sitting in a theatre and listening to an orchrestra perform while a silent picture was being projected onto a screen.
The movie METROPOLIS deserves five stars. This DVD, would have gotten only one star, but because I still came away enjoying the film and because I liked the score, I give it two stars.

It is being shown in cinemas now, and upon its release on DVD later this year, it will be the only version of this film to own. The version offered above is basically like an 8-track tape from 1975, and the editing and music makes the film look like a bad comedy.

Personally, I recommend the Kino version, which is now unfortunately out-of-print, and would never recommend the tinted 80's version as the soundtrack is just too distracting.

956639,5,6305013578,"Amazon is lumping reviews of every possible edition of Metropolis together. What a shame, since the truely unwatchable (Madacy, Koch, etc) are being lumped together with the divine (Kino).

So, let's make this simple. Get the most recent Kino release, ""The Complete Metropolis"", preferably on Blu-Ray. AVOID any other version, as they are simply too horrible for words, nearly unwatchable prints with terrible and unrelated soundtracks added on. (I';m completely ignoring the Morodor version here, by the way. I figure it is it's own piece of work, and does not matter here.)

The most recent restoration, done in 2010, is as profound a revelation as the 2001 restoration was. The addition of newly found (and terrible quality) material from Argentina has completed the story and tied together a fair number of loose ends that were evident in the film. It is amazing to see how a 5 second shot can completely change the context and meaning of a whole sequence, and how much more dramatic the escape of the children from the underground city is. The soundtrack is now perfectly matched to the action, and all but one important sequence are in place.

The picture quality is superb, and the transfer is very nicely done. The restoration team made some very good choices in presenting the material in a way that lets the film flow, but also shows the limits of restoration of some of the material.

The movie still has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and the acting still varies from good to awful, but the sum of the parts makes these problems seemingly wither away. It is now much easier to get swept away by this film.",1015200000,6,1630,4.7695035460992905
956640,2,6305013578,"Metropolis is essentially a story about rich families living off of the labors of the workers while knowing nothing about the lives of those workers. They don't even care about the workers. A son of a rich family falls for a woman who lives among the workers. The son decides to look into the lives of the working class.
Although this is regarded as a classic movie, it has been reported that Fritz Lang didn't like it.
Queen (the rock group) based the music video for ""Radio Ga Ga"" on Metropolis.
This is probably the worst DVD of a silent movie. It appears to have been made from a videotape of a 16mm print. The image is very grainy because of that. The master tape even has a dropout. (A dropout is caused by a tape particle falling from the tape after a recording has been made. This can result in white lines appearing in the image.) The titles do not fit onscreen - which used to be a problem with many of the cheap silent film tapes made over 10 years ago. I've had to deal with that before, but no one should be making editions like that now.
The music is simply thrown on the DVD. It doesn't seem to fit the movie at all. I had the same problem with my videotape from Murray Hill - very old edition from the late 1980s. It seems like no one is making a decent edition of this movie for American release. I wouldn't even mind seeing the rock version that was released in theaters sometime during the '80s. ('80s rock music was used instead of classical or organ music.) I hated the music on the tape so much I created my own audio tape  to play while watching the movie. The music on this DVD is a little better than that tape was.
The extras are a joke except for the trivia questions. I'm actually surprised I got them all correct even though I hadn't seen the movie for 6 years. (The videotape is in storage.)
The case's insert has instructions on how to remove the DVD from the case, and they are the wrong directions for the case they are currently using. It's still a Keep Case, but it's the case where you have to put one finger under the disc at the top. The instructions are for the style where you push on the tabs that hold onto the center hole of the disc.
I wouldn't blame the price for the lack of quality. I have some decent DVDs that cost less than this one with better image quality - Boris Karloff and Vincent Price double feature DVDs.",1015027200,,2363,4.239467849223947

Great care has been taken in improving the image quality (contrast, etc.), only the best material was used. This version was shown at the Berlin film festival 2001 with a new score by Bernd Schultheiss.
If you want Metropolis on DVD you should wait a few more months. The film is due for release this year and will probably contain the new Schultheiss score, as well as the original Huppertz score. You'll also have the opportunity to view Metropolis in an accurate projection speed with the best possible film-to-DVD transfer.

This movie definately conveys an industrial feeling. The opening scene of the horde of down-hearted workers slowly trudging into the elevator that will lower them into a hell-like machine, reminded me a lot of the first Apple commercial.

There are no issues with tinting/no tinting, new score/old score.  Here it's just that the transfer is downright painful to watch -- grainy, scratchy, at times out of focus, at times so dark you can barely see the action.  The gorgeous production design and innovative filmmaking is buried under layers of artifacts from a bad transfer.  It looks like someone videotaped it off of a TV (using a camcorder through a dirty window), then watched the tape about twenty times, then put it on the DVD.

Let's face it, you could do much worse than this edition.  If you are a hardcore fan of Fritz Lang, there are better to be had.  But for a guy like me who simply enjoys the film, the style, the story, this was an wonderful disc.
Turn it on, turn all the lights off, turn down the soundtrack, and enjoy the movie.",976665600,2,970,4.232432432432432
956825,2,6305013578,"This DVD does no justice for this Sci_Fi classic.  You would think if someone was to put Metropolis out on DVD, they would at least put out a quality print.  Sometimes the images on screen are so bright, you're just looking at a white screen.  The soundtrack sucks because for one it doesnt correspond to the screen action, and two, it sounds too ""clean"" for this terrible print.  My advice?  Save a few bucks and pick up the Giorgio Moroder version at an online auction house.  The print quality is much better, it includes a few missing scenes and still shots, and if you don't like the early 80's soundtrack, turn the volume down and play what you feel like.  I would have given it one star but it's such a great movie if you get the right version.",975628800,2,751,4.359712230215828

I don't mind the music 'misplaced' with the action, and I'm certainly glad that I didn't shell out ten bucks for Bonnie Tyler yammering away on the late 80's release of Metropolis, but this DVD felt like it skimmed on quality to get it out of the door.  Metropolis deserves better than this treatment, especially in a digital format.

956827,1,6305013578,"It's sad to think of the fact that approximately half of all the movies made before 1930 are irrecoverably lost, never to be seen again. The obvious conclusion one can draw from this is that we need to be extra vigilant about protecting the delicate prints we have of the films that are still here. And that's why it makes me angry to see the absolutely awful copy of Metropolis that is to date the only version of the film available on DVD. The film is framed poorly, played at the wrong speed and has awful music accompanying the film. That a company would put this classic film out in this fashion for people to pay money for is a scandal. There are better versions of the film available on VHS, especially the Kino Video release of the film which I was fortunate enough to see, so why should this be the only version of the movie available on DVD? For some reason, some classic films seems to have fallen through the cracks, and despite the heroic efforts of film restorers who are working hard to preserve as much of the early days of motion pictures as possible, it would be a crime if Metropolis ended up being one of the ones that disappears. Anyone who appreciates this film or indeed appreciates film in general should be crying out for Kino to release their version on DVD, or better yet, for Criterion to issue a restored version. THAT would be worth paying for!",971136000,6,1374,4.434782608695652
956889,2,6305013578,"I agree with Jim Gay's review. This is one of the great early films -- the  predecessor to Blade Runner in its imagery and its plot, but this DVD falls  far short of doing justice to the original. The sound track is an unrelated  series of pieces of impressionist classical chamber music, and the picture  is almost indecipherable much of the time.

I have only seen this film in cinemas. From what i gather, it is the East German version from about 1975 that is THE version  to get.

956894,5,6305013578,"This is not a review of any DVD version of Metropolis.  I am given to understand that most of them are of rather poor quality and not worth the purchase.  However, I thought I would just mention that I would love to see  the ""restored"" version of Metropolis, as released in the  mid-1980s with a rock-and-roll soundtrack, on DVD.  That version had a  pretty good image quality with colored hues on various reels to highlight  certain moods (and I don't mean colorized, as in the horrible Ted Turner  method, either).  The 1980s version was also fairly complete, although I've  seen a celluloid version with some extra scenes at the nightclub, which  surprised me.  As for the rock soundtrack, some people don't like it very  much, but it doesn't bother me.  And besides, that's what the volume  control is for.  But the bottom line is that the 1980s restored version is  probably better than any of the versions currently on DVD, and I would  certainly purchase it if it became available (I'm not sure it's even  available anymore on VHS, though).  Anyhow, the movie gets 5 stars from me  for being a silent classic.
The DVD gets a N/A rating from me, BUT...I  should say that Madacy, which makes the most current budget DVD, is  notorious for non-restored DVDs with horrible image/sound quality.  You  have been warned.",963446400,12,1320,4.734513274336283
956895,2,6305013578,"Metropolis is one of the all-time great films, that goes without saying. It is a well crafted story of opression of the working class when cold-hearted capitalism takes hold. What really impresses me about this  film though, is the wonderful sets, which are very advanced for its  day.
The DVD of Metropolis on the other hand, doesn't do the film  justice. The print is often so scratchy it is not exactly clear what is  going on. If you cannot find a copy of this film anywhere else go ahead and  get this. Only if a better copy can't be found though, because a clearer  print would be worth the money. By way of extra features, this DVD only has  one worth mentioning. This is the trivia game. At the end of the film there  is a multiple choice game that asks questions about the content of the  film.

956896,5,6305013578,"Metropolis is one of may all-time favourite movies. The plot concerns a man, Freder Fredersen, who is the son of the mastermind behind an ultramodern city. The city is completely mechanised but is supported by a  mass of workers who operate the machines that keep the city alive and who  live underground (a little improbable but literalism isn't always important  in expressionistic films). Freder is unaware of the underground workers  until a daughter of one of the slaves comes above ground and Freder sees  her. He is struck with compassion for these people and asks his father  about them, who, as the leader of the city, is happy for things to remain  as they are. The master of Metropolis consults with Rotwang, a mad  scientist of sorts (the allusion to the evil magician is only slightly  masked), who comes up with a robot that when mass produced, will ultimately  replace all of the humans below, making the city completely automated. The  robot is made in the likeness of the young woman and sows the seeds of  sedition, which casues the workers below to destroy all of the machines,  and thus ruining the city. A truce is reached at the end. The  cinematography of this move is stunning, the acting is beautiful and the  message is even more real today than it was when the movie was made in  1926. The idea of a fully automated society in which machines are more  important thatn human beings seems all to real today, whereas it was only a  distant fabtasy in the twenties. While the literal torture that the workers  lived in seems out of place now, the possibility of total mechanisation  still remains a fearful spectre.
