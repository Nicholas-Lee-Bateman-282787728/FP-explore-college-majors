6335646,5,B00J5LXQJC,"Sailor O'Connor (Dominic Purcell) is a retired boxer, working as a welder. His mom (Sheila McCarthy) claims he is ""used up and broken."" She is dying from cancer and bitter at God. She wants to see the ""old country"" one more time before she dies. Sailor wants to go into the ring to obtain a purse so she can go.

As the fight begins the film is consumed with flashbacks, at times getting only 30 seconds of fighting before we go back in time again. During these flashbacks we get to see the life of the other fighter King Solomon (Izaak Smith), newly married with a baby on the way. He has a mother issue also. We get to see behind the scenes of the promotion and the mystery of Diane (Famke Janssen) the woman who has done the ""unforgivable."" The film slowly builds levels of complexity around a single fight.

I enjoyed the opening of the reading of Percival, and the quick establishment of character. This is not a film about boxing, but that of a fighter. a man who refuses to lay down both in the ring and in life...in case you missed the symbolism.

The film was better than expected, and has that life drama that ""Lifetime"" fans can enjoy as well.

6335647,4,B00J5LXQJC,"""The best we can do is to forgive ourselves."" Sailor O'Connor (Purcell) is an aging fighter with a past that won't let him go. He is trying to move on when he is approached by a local promoter for one last fight. After agreeing for the biggest payday he's ever had he tells his mother and old trainer, neither of whom is happy about it. His opponent is an up and coming young kid with a past he is also trying to change. Together they fight not only each other but the past they can't forget. As many of you know I am a huge fan of sports movies. Being a lower budget one that not many people have heard of I wasn't expecting too much from this. I'm not sure if that had any effect on my feelings toward this but I really really enjoyed it. Every other boxing movie I have seen tells the story of the characters then ends with the fight. This one switches between the fighting and the story which I really enjoyed. You see some punches then part of the fighters life which segues beautifully into the break in between rounds. That gives extra meaning to the rest period. I could go on and on about this but I'll end by saying I highly recommend this. Overall, not sure if it was because I wasn't expecting something this good but I really enjoyed this. I actually liked it more then The Fighter. I give this an A-.",1402617600,4,1314,4.1976284584980235

6335669,5,B00J5LXQJC,"There is an underlying and powerful ""goodness"" to this film and the characters portrayed in it.  Loved it!",1410566400,,106,4.888888888888889
6335670,3,B00J5LXQJC,"It seems like the boxing movie has been around for quite a while now. I remember an early movie I saw as a child was SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME with Paul Newman. RAGING BULL found critics loving a boxing film. And then there's the whole series of ROCKY films. So when you hear about a new boxing film you have to wonder will it be good or just riding on the coattails of previous hits. I can tell you now that A FIGHTING MAN is indeed a good movie.

Sailor O'Connor (Dominic Purcell) is an aging boxer who has seen better days. Sailor has the distinction of never having been knocked down in his career. He may not have won all of his fights but he's never been knocked down. After a three year hiatus from boxing he decides to go back for one more fight. His motivation? His mother is dying and he wants to use the money he will earn to take her on one last trip to her homeland of Ireland.

His competitor is King (Izaak Smith), a young man who has seen bad times of his own. An ex-drug addict whose mother currently uses, King has met a woman he loves, cleaned up his act and is expecting a child with his soon to be wife. He needs this opportunity to move forward, to become the boxer that he always knew he could be. It was only his mistakes and not having a worthwhile goal that stopped him. With his new focus he could be a champion.

With this match up there is no good guy/bad guy face off coming here. You can't simply root for one without feeling for the other. That makes this movie something different than in most films. Where most have you rooting for the underdog here we have two underdogs, both with equally important reasons to want to win. That makes it different and makes the build up all the more powerful.

The movie doesn't follow a linear pattern here telling the tale from start to finish. It moves back and forth in time from the fight that's taking place to the motivations and development of that fight. First off Sailor has to convince his old trainer Brother Albright (James Caan) to be in his corner again. Brother doesn't want to because he's afraid another fight will be the last thing Sailor ever does. Only at the bequest of Sailor's mother does he take the job on.

King has almost the same problem. King needs Cubby (Louis Gossett Jr.) in his corner to help and train him. But Cubby remembers King for the boxer he was and could have been. He was so completely disappointed in what happened he doesn't want to take him back on. As King proves himself worth, Cubby changes his mind.

As both of these stories are unfolding there is there are two side stories, the first of Fast Eddie (Adam Beach), the boxing promoter who could care less about either boxer. What he sees is money in the bank. Putting the two boxers on the card to face one another he knows that Sailor and his reputation will draw in a crowd. It's the reason he capitulates to Sailor's demand for bigger prize money, win or lose. In King he sees a chance to steal an up and coming great boxer for himself from Cubby.

The second involves Diane (Famke Janssen), a woman from Sailor's past that we're not sure of until near the end of the film. How she is connected to Sailor is never quite clear until that time. How their lives intertwined and affected Sailor makes his story that much deeper than it seemed.

It is the combining of all of these stories that makes this a more exceptional movie than one would expect to find. The depth of character and story create a film that holds your interest from start to finish. When you include the acting caliber as well you have one dynamite movie. While all the actors you have here are amazing, Dominic Purcell finally gets a chance to shine. I've always felt he was an overlooked actor in the past relegated to made for SyFy films. He deserves better and this movie proves it.

If you're a fan of boxing films you'll love this one. If not, you'll still have a good time and a worthwhile rental from the local outlet. Either way this movie is a no lose film that deserves your attention and is worth checking out.",1409356800,,4064,4.329829172141919

6335673,5,B00J5LXQJC,"Excellent movie.
Heart warming and well done. I read the one star reviews after I saw the film and my jaw dropped.  Just goes to show you can't depend on the opinion of others.  (Mine excluded).
You won't like this movie if you're into special effects with a shallow story line.  Such individuals should gravitate towards the newer James Bond movies or Transformers.  OK, I can enjoy these too but if you have any depth, you will find this movie worth the purchase price.",1405814400,,471,4.571428571428571
6335674,1,B00J5LXQJC,I gave this movie a chance because of the excellent cast. This was a definite snooze fest. Very boring movie that tried to give background stories on every cast member but unfortunately did a horrible job in doing so. Even the entire boxing match was slow and drawn out. Don't even bother watching this,1404777600,,302,4.611111111111111
6335675,4,B00J5LXQJC,For some reason I wanted to watch a movie where I could watch guys beating the crap out of each other.  Since I am Stallone-intolerant I settled on this one.  Much to my surprise this is a really good drama about forgiveness and redemption.  Plus you get guys beating the crap out of each other.  Check rhymewriter's review; it's a an excellent thumbnail of this film,1403913600,,367,4.515151515151516
6335676,5,B00J5LXQJC,"Rocky it ain't. Fighting man is a film school A+ flick. The acting isn't great but it's very, very good. The directing is the bomb. The editing is a hell of a lot better than Rocky 1 - 48, and the story telling well the story telling was what made this a great movie. I'm scared to talk about it because I don't want to give anything away. I will simply say that this was a five bucks well spent, and I'm glad I watched it here, in my home instead of on the big screen. It was a kind of TV movie, but it was great television without the commercials. Check it out.",1403740800,3,563,3.9473684210526314
