I was out of town on business, and I stumbled into the ole Blockbuster, and I thought I would give this un-known movie a try, as Im a big Mary Steenburgen fan. I was so delighted by this funny, serious, and heart touching movie, that I couldn't understand, why I never heard of it? Did it come and go in the movies? Great acting all around, with a lot of unknown actors. My favorite was the car mechanic living out in the desert played by Arthur Senzy, who I saw again in (I also rented) ""A Few Good Men"".Ted Danson, the Kid, and  Eric Schweig were great as was Mary Steenburgen. All in all, a great cast, and a very delightful movie for this weary traveler.",980294400,17,740,4.2785714285714285
644413,5,6303416578,"This was a funny movie! It is about a father who is crazy, and tells his son to look at everything from another perspective. (The father admits to being in the nuthouse at one point in the movie. His wife does too.) His son is very moody, and his wife is deranged and is afraid to leave her house. The father takes his son on a trip to the grand canyon, to coincide with the astronaut's landing on the moon. Along the way, the father does some amazing things. He gets drunk, and hits on women in a bar, and he is almost shot when his son's pet snake escapes. (The bar customers paniced.) The father also beats the living s**t out of some ruffian in a diner. He also gets in trouble with the police. The father is a very cool character. (And I'm serious he REALLY is!) His wife also spends the movie driving around trying to find them. And the son also drives a car! (Well, kind of.) They also travel with an Indian. (Who does not believe in fighting, but the father sure does!) A lot of zany stuff happens in this classic fairy tale! It involves a pontiac. It is a fantastic movie, it deserved an academy award, and it MUST, under ANY circumstances be rereleased on DVD! A true classic, this is one not to miss!",977875200,10,1211,4.224137931034483

644485,1,6303416578,"I bought a copy of this movie at Big Lots in North Hollywood today, and I just finished watching it! .... and I must say, it is the first movie to overtake ""The Lonely Lady"" as the single worst movie I have ever seen! .... seriously! ... the worst! .... I found myself feeling sorry for the actors as they suffered their way through that script!

I want my 3 Bucks back!",1419638400,,370,4.138888888888889

644488,5,6303416578,"This movie is worth the money. It delivers a good message about facing your fears. Interesting characters. Good soundtrack. Although they do drop the GD word a lot, it's still a kid's movie and enjoyable for adults too.",1397779200,,219,4.7894736842105265
644489,5,6303416578,"I love this movie.  The story is about the 60's, my time, and gives me some good memories, and quite a few laughs.",1390953600,,114,3.9565217391304346

644492,4,6303416578,"It was nice to watch how this family managed to heal and renew their lives together.  One thing interesting, though, was to see how a Native American, (who fought in the Vietnam War, and whose people have been through genocide, assimilation processes, and abject poverty on reservations) is the one to offer Zen-like advice that is sorely needed for these white folks having trouble getting past a miscarriage brought on from a car accident.  Good acting, especially from Mary Steenburgen and the boy who played her son.",1367193600,,520,4.9655172413793105

644515,3,6303416578,Eric Schweig and the little boy gave the only professional performances in the entire movie.  The performances of Ted Danson and Mary Steamburgen were overdone and amateurish.,1353110400,,175,5.481481481481482
644516,5,6303416578,"Good family movie that ties family issues (father and son trying to cope with the boy's mother's mental illness) with current events - mainly the first moon landing.  The lead actors are very good (Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgh), but the child actor (Ryan Todd) steals the show.  He is outstanding in his struggles to accept his mother's illness but still try to get some enjoyment out of life.",1304985600,,395,4.7101449275362315
644517,3,6303416578,a great idea but with very unnecessary language. i would not recomend it for families or younger ones. they should have kept it clean for everyone.,1264982400,,147,4.6923076923076925

644519,5,6303416578,"As a movie collector for decades who considers himself very critical & picky about films, I can't help myself, I love this movie. Yeah, it's maybe a little far-fetched or sentimental sometimes but there isn't a second of it that's not enjoyable - it's just too charming and well directed with exactly that effect in mind, and with a beautiful musical score, superb cinematography and a tight script. I think Ted Danson possibly gives his best performance ever as Washington Bellamy, an enraptured-with-knowledge elementary school teacher who also collects beautifully oddball classic cars. The story line described above about trying to match the distance the Apollo crew travels by simultaneously driving over a large part of the country to the Spires of the Moon National Park is already a remarkably charming idea. This will be his ""one perfect act""

 Washington Bellamy is a Don Quixote character, an idealistic and highly enthusiastic lover of nature & science who throughout the film is fighting ignorance rather than windmills and is enamored of the idea of a ""perfect act"". But along with strengths he has his faults, like all heroes, which come out painfully at several points in the film - so sensitive about faults that even his insignificant mix up of Galileo and Issac Newton attributions of a natural law pains him. His impractical view of life is symbolized toward the end by the breaking of the glass Pontiac hood piece by his more realistic son. Washington's wife, played so well by Mary Steenburgen, is the extreme opposite of her adventurous & idealistic husband - she doesn't even want to leave her house - and completely frustrates him. She is forced to overcome even extreme paranoia to chase after her impractical man and son.

 Of course, interesting adventures and troubles occur during the journeys but it's Washington's never failing enthusiasm for life and its wonders that really make the film's ideas all work. I've watched this film a number of times and will watch it again into old age and when I'm no longer able to enjoy it I'll be ready to die.",1127088000,7,2080,4.917378917378917
644520,5,6303416578,"Embedding in a stirring and wonderful musical score is the story of a road trip that chronologically parallels the landing on the moon. Always interesting with comedic highlights, a superb piece of clean entertainment that is truly a rarity today. A must see for all families.",1111708800,5,276,5.021739130434782
644521,1,6303416578,"Pontiac Moon is a movie that you have to see...because it's so terrible! There are so many parts of the movie that don't need to be there...like when Washington (Ted Danson) visits his freak brother I mean whats the point. Anyway, you must rent this movie. It will always be on the shelf at the movie rental store...because this movie STINKS!",1083369600,11,342,4.622950819672131
644522,5,6303416578,"Sure, the movie's perfectly enjoyable on its own merits, but owners and admirers of the Amphicar, an amphibious ""boat-car"" manufactured in the '60s, will especially appreciate having this film in their collections.  For them it will be clear that while the Pontiac of the title actually craps out underway, the Amphicar is the truly transcendent vehicle, which in the end redeems all of them.  Perhaps they should have called it ""Amphicar Moon.""",1060992000,10,445,5.166666666666667
644523,5,6303416578,"PONTIAC MOON is a movie treat watching a simply good story unfold. I haven't had a movie catch my interest as much as this one for quite some time. It a film which relies on strong acting and strong script, with a few Greek-Navaho special effects tossed into the scenes now and then. It is a humorous quest with a story of Apollo moonwalk that is counterpoint genius on film; father and son in a 1949 Pontiac whose ignition starts a journey the moment America's Apollo first moon landing blasts off. From that point the counterpoint of Appollo and Pontiac continues until the quest is . . . well, I'll let you see the movie and find out if father and son reach their quest. To be a real quest, of course, the father and son must be detoured--in this case literally, then stranded under a desert starry sky, next stalled at a supper club which features an Americana singing contest--how I enjoyed  hearing the vocal of  ""Kansas City""--then the Pontiac is off the trail for the father to borrow money from a family sheep-rancher relative, they are once more stalled by a cracked engine block, followed by more tense scenes of delay; all this action in a quest to reach the Spires of the Moon, Idaho before the moment of moonwalk touchdown. Together with the emphasis on the quest Danson's wife, Mary Steenburgen, has developed a phobia--she doesn't dare leave her home having holed up there for seven years. She is hyper-careful with an attitude that has put her family into mental recession. Mary has to decide whether she has the courage to follow Danson and son. Her decision leads to some interesting and amusing scenes. Will she seek her husband and arrive as an ex machina to save the day? This movie will teach you the two rules of getting along in life. To repeat, I haven't seen a movie managed as well as PONTIAC MOON for a long time. Ryan Todd, the son, together with Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson gave excellent off-beat performances.",1001376000,15,1946,4.605187319884727
7846729,5,6303416578,Very good ending.  I am happy with it.  Good story line.  It was a suspense a little. The actors very good acting their parts.  Ted and Mary were wonderful.,1502841600,,156,4.275862068965517
7846730,3,6303416578,"It's a novelty storyline film, but it's not really that interesting.  Basically Ted Danson plays, Washington, a school teacher (who's kid is somehow in his class) who thinks he's a bit of a knowitall, quoting bits of trivia at anyone who disagrees with him or angers him. Sort of like a 60's version of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. But as will be revealed throughout the film, Washington's not as bright as he thinks, such as when a police man corrects him with the fact Newton said something Washington claimed Galileo did. Anyway he decides to defy his wife who is suffering from a phobia of setting foot outside her house, to let their son ride in an automobile for the first time (he owns nine).  She is terrified he will die, even if he sits in one that the engine isn't running.  Washington plans on paralleling the rocket's journey to the moon, finishing their drive at a crater created by a chunk of the moon impacting what is now the USA a long time ago.  They plan to arrive at the same time the Apollo crew lands on the moon.  Why someone so into science wouldn't actually want to watch this historic event occur is a bit difficult to believe.  When Katherine (Mary Steenburgen wearing a really bad wig) wakes up she reads the note Washington left, outlining their plans.  Although not plausible with her phobia, she gets in another of Washington's odd cars, and drives after them.

The film seemed to not have decided what its target market was supposed to be.  At times it's like a kids' film, at others it gives the okay to cheating on your wife (although he changes his mind), multiple acts of stealing with different victims, drinking to excess when you're responsible for a kid, violence, fleeing in a car from police, throwing objects through patrol car pursuing you windshields amongst many other things you wouldn't want a child watching to think is okay.

It's also obvious at times the background isn't real, especially when looking at the stars.  Not sure if this was supposed to emulate a theater play or something in that regard.  Spoilers for the end but is the Canadian government really not going to let American fugitives be arrested and sent back to the US to face charges?",1494979200,,2208,4.618925831202046
