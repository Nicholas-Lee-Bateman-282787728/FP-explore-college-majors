8752001,2,B01BZJO9FQ,"At least 3 movies about lawman Wyatt Earp were taken from Stuart N. Lakes book, Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal (1934).  The best I can say is that this is one of them.  Directed by Allan Dwan (The Three Musketeers), this telling barely viable with just a smidge of truthiness (thanks Stephen Colbert) as far as historical accuracy.

Randolph Scott plays Wyatt who arrives at the booming mining town of Tombstone, Arizona hoping to start a stage line.  Since there is already 2, both owned by the mayor, Wyatt accepts a job as the town marshal.  And if you're wondering, theres not an Earp brother in sight.  There is a Doc Halliday (not Holliday), played by Latin heartthrob Cesar Romero.  Doc is a retired medical doctor (not a dentist) who moves west to die alone from his tuberculosis.  Hopefully in a gunfight.

Sure the movie has a gunfight and its just outside the O.K. Corral but its just Wyatt as Doc has been shot dead (he actually died a couple years later).  Oh and there is no Clanton gang either.  The primary bad guy is Curley Bill (Joe Sawyer), Ben Carter (John Carradine, later would play Dracula) and Pringle (Lon Chaney Jr. who would become a Wolfman a few years later).  The female interests are played by Nancy Kelly as Sarah, Docs old girlfriend and Binnie Barnes as Jerry, Docs current girlfriend.  A lot of old west hokum.",1480723200,,1343,4.616033755274262
