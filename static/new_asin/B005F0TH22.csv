8469404,4,B005F0TH22,"I'm only partway through this set, but am really enjoying it so far.  It is interesting with good re-enactments, and it always amazes me the things people are able to survive.

Of course, this set doesn't quite compare with ""Your Worst Animal Nightmares,"" which is one of the most awesome animal attack shows I've ever seen (in my opinion, anyway).  Although I slightly prefer ""...Nightmares,"" this one is still definitely worth watching.",1403481600,,438,5.055555555555555

8469407,4,B005F0TH22,"The whole point of watching a reality/documentary series on people surviving in animal attack and survival situations is to imagine the circumstances. This series combines tasteful recreations with the first person accounts of the actual people involved in the incidents in a very effective manner.

Episodes each typically tell two stories, one about a big animal attack (some sort of large predator) and another on a small animal attack (poisonous snakes or something). For some reason I'm only interested in the big animal stories, and I suppose that's because there are more variables. Every snakebite story is kind of the same: guys steps on snake; guy hallucinates on the way to the hospital; guy gets anti-venom and hates life for a couple of weeks before he can go golfing again. Maybe it's that you can actively do something when you're being charged by a pile of bears, when the only thing you can do after a snakebite is try not to die while you're unconscious in the helicopter.

Personal bias notwithstanding, the series is well done and a good example of the genre.",1354320000,2,1079,4.890710382513661
8469408,4,B005F0TH22,"These are true stories of horrible attacks on people, by INSECTS, REPTILES, FISH, and ANIMALS. They tell the storys of their lucky escape from these creatures. But they haven't come out of it in perfect condition. Sometimes they have lost a limb after their terrible ordeal.  A family was attacked by a swarm of african killer bees, there were thousands of bees all over them, that it looked like they were wraped in a carpet. One man was lifted up by an elephants trunk, then put into its mouth, fortunately for him, the elephant spat him out. His injuries from this experince were...Broken Ribs, a Punctured Stomach, Collapsed Lungs a Bruised Heart, Broken Back and a Shattered Elbow. The episodes...JOURNEYS...BLOOD SURVIVORS...BATTLEGROUNDS...SAVED...GOLD...OUT OF THE BLUE...BROTHERHOOD...LAST MAN STANDING...A NEW DAY...LOST.",1347494400,2,831,5.4921875
