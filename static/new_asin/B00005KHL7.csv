1620246,5,B00005KHL7,I purchased this DVD for my Father who is a Veteran and ex POW of the Korean war. We both agree that this is one of the best documentaries on the subject yet. High quality narration and footage give the viewer a good understanding of how and why the war was fought.,1066694400,28,265,4.115384615384615
1620247,3,B00005KHL7,"And not so many things to watch.
But, I studied much about my country's desperate history.
This must be a good historical documentary on Korean war.
After having seen this, I strengthened my mind more to fight against the DPRK tyranny regime in North Korea, a component of AXIS OF EVIL.
Finally, I FEEL to thank you Americans for giving us priceless freedom now we Koreans enjoy.",1066608000,31,379,4.6716417910447765

7943393,4,B00005KHL7,"The narrative concentrates on the first year of the war when the battle lines changed the most, then tapers off during the final two years of negotiations and a see-saw battlefront.  The direct involvement of Russian advisors is not covered.  Still, this script clarifies the changing strategy of the UN forces throughout the conflict.  This is not a complete record, and favors the American perspective, but is still worth seeing.

Some of the bonus footage is not in color:  bonus timeline newsreels, Monroe visit, McCarthy TV interview at the start of his rise, and bios of Ike and Doug.",1380240000,,590,4.91919191919192
7943394,5,B00005KHL7,"As a Korean combat infantry veteran of the 1953 summer campaign, this CD does a good job of summarizing all the major war activities of the Korean 1950-1953 war, and in full color.  This same CD is sold in South Korea gift shops for veteran's purchase, as I made a return visit to South Korea, and saw it there on my re-visit tour.",1310342400,4,331,4.253968253968254
7943395,4,B00005KHL7,"The ""Korean War in Color"" is an excellent 90-minute run thorough of the Korean War with incredible footage of the ""forgotten war"".  The production is top-notch with a constant flow of newsreel, servicemembers' own camera footage, gun camera reels, and combat correspondent sound bites.  Speeches referenced are actual sound recordings (Truman, MacArthur, etc.) which many Korean War books refer, but hearing the President's own voice and MacArthur's scruffy gerneral-like proclamations are real electronic media treasures for historians.  With the exception of some of the b-movie quality background theme music, the quality of the presentation is very good.

I would recommend this film for classroom use with high school or older students (graphic, shows dead corpses, etc.), or for individuals reading about the war who want a quick review or to see the footage to support previously read text.

I did note one factual discrepancy in the film.  Towards the end, the film states the negotiations for peace began at the town of P'ammunjom.  This is incorrect.  The first armistice meeting occurred at Kaesong in Communist-held territory on 10 July 1951 and meetings continued at Kaesong through 23 August.  The talks then moved and resumed at the new location in P'anmmunjom, approximately 6 miles east of Kaesong (see Dvorchak, ""Battle for Korea"" p. 227, 234).  Other than this relatively minor flaw I noted no historical errors.",1261180800,3,1431,5.32

  chronorogical,Battles oriented Book.!
most shortcoming of this book  are many different scenes Which include Excuting  by fire squad
was not included in korean War was the incident of Shootinig Guerillas was excuted ROK MP before  the Korean War.
also the US Infantry's Training Scenes was braught from recent pictures(recent rifles and recnt uniforms)
Bonusincluduing  visiting Marilyn Monroe to Korean front and many Amature pictures especiaaly
 with Flying Jet Fighters gave me the big smile. During Korean War, Battles during Korean Winter was
 miserablle due to Freezing cold and frost bite and following necrosis evantually increased operation
 of Amputees in M.A.S.H.(Real M.A.S.H.!).

7943397,5,B00005KHL7,"I study history and the Korean War in Color gave me an insight of what the US & UN forces went through to stem the North Korean and Communist
Chinese onslaught. Excellent DVD and it should be a part of any military
history collection. I strongly recommend the DVD.",1211068800,,264,4.408163265306122
7943398,5,B00005KHL7,"The quality of the color footage is excellent & an order of magnitude better than any WW2 color doc you'll see.  Most of the content is from filmers attached to the Marines, but there is also some Army & air footage too.  The doc is loaded with Pershings in action, and you get a good feel for the period color 'Marine Corps Green', which is like a deep Bronze green. The coverage is mainly action, very little on politics.  Pershings blasting, Corsairs dropping napalm, grunts shooting flamethrowers...you get the idea.  A must have if you are a Korean War military historian, and for WW2 buffs who want to see the same equipment used in high quality color film.  Buy it & see how some very underappreciated warriors held back the Red Beast & won the second round of the Cold War (Berlin Airlift being the first).  Unfortunately the generation of the time, spoiled with the absolute crushing victories over the Axis Powers of WW2, cynically dubbed the war 'to die for a tie'.  Tell that to the generations of South Koreans who have been spared a life under the insane dictators to their north.  In absolute terms, the war was as much a victory for the US/UN as was the First Gulf War.  Limited objectives...keep South Korea & later Kuwait, free.",1163030400,10,1246,4.601809954751131
