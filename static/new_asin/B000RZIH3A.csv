He was great in Uncle Kent too. This is also one of Bewersdorf's best scores for a Swanberg film, and it's available for download at the official site. You should give it a try.

The Benten Films package is exquisite and I'm in love with those guys after purchasing this and Aaron Katz's Quiet City/Dance Party USA combo. They put so much attention to detail and they actually care about the films, the whole package is almost like a collectible item.",1356998400,,623,4.822429906542056
8203393,2,B000RZIH3A,"The problem with this movie is that it doesn't give you a good reason to care about the characters. I did like how some of the video work was done but you can tell this is low budget. That doesn't mean it is bad but it isn't ground breaking either. I did enjoy the main character's interesting music. He was also the best actor in this movie.
Definitely not your typical flick. I found the concept intriguing but a bit long for what it is. Still it is kind of an interesting film but I don't need to see it again. I found it to be somewhat of a depressing film yet I think that was the intention. It's quite a commentary on some people's addiction to technology.

This has adult situations and not for children.",1336003200,,711,4.227941176470588
8203394,1,B000RZIH3A,"I saw this at SXSW in 2006, as it was one of only a small handful of films that actually sounded interesting.  Being poorly shot and acted can sometimes be charming in an independent film, but this appeared to have no script and was simply about a bunch of morons wallowing around in a zombified state of non-existence.  Sure, sure, that's what most people are doing at all times, but who wants to watch that?  What could an audience member hope to gain from the experience?  If you're going to make a worthwhile film (perhaps an inexorable oxymoron, these days) about such awful people, try adding some insight.  Don't just get stoned and think that everything you commit to tape is genius.  Many sections of this interminably dull tripe reminded me of an old friend who took snippets of minutia that he captured from people and places in his life and then edited together into effervescent little music videos to amuse himself.  ""Aw, isn't that cute?"", we'd say during the first one.  Then he'd do the same thing again... and again... and again...  So if you don't mind praising a mindless twit whose only ambition in life appears to be making movies, despite not knowing one good reason why he should, watch this.  If you have anything better to do, I suggest you do that instead.",1253664000,5,1283,4.6371681415929205
8203395,3,B000RZIH3A,"I've seen a handful of movies from this group of people, but only one by this actual director. I think I preferred this one a bit to his other movie, Hannah Takes the Stairs.

It definitely brings to light an interesting and important topic, being too connected and plugged in via the phones and computers (which I suspect might be me right now). And this movie is a good example of maybe what not to do! It depicts strained relationships and ones left unexplored because of technology as a distraction and interference.

My favorite parts of the movie were the montages of mouth sounds that are cut together to make music (by one of the characters.) I couldn't get enough of it! I also liked the montages of camera phone pictures played to voice mails. Beautiful stuff.",1235260800,4,770,4.613138686131387
