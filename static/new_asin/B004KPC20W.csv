8433272,1,B004KPC20W,This ended up being an Italian film and instead of one they sent two which I was billed for and couldn't watch on American equipment.,1406678400,,133,4.36
8433273,4,B004KPC20W,"Alan Ladd's first film with his own company Jaguar Productions, it was written and directed by Delmar Daves who was well known for giving a sympathetic point of view to the Indians in many of his westerns, which may well have been due to his having lived for a while among the Navajo and Hopi Indians.

In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant sent for Indian fighter Johnny MacKay and appoints him peace commissioner of Modoc territory near the North Californian and South Oregon border country. On the way west  he must escort Nancy Meek (Audrey Dalton) to the home of her aunt and uncle. Friendly Indians Toby (Marisa Pavan) and Manok played by Anthony Caruso (who was a permanent fixture in most Ladd movies) help Johnny to set up peace talks with a renegade Modoc chief called Captain Jack (Charles Bronson). During the peace talks with General Canby Captain Jack pulls a revolver and open fire on the General and his aides. The renegades quickly disperse to their stronghold. Eventually they were all dispersed and tracked down. Finally Johnny Mackay following  a chase catches up with Captain Jack and after a shootout and hand-to-hand combat places him under arrest!

Filmed in CinemaScope on location in Cathedral Rock, Sedona, Arizona it boasts fine scenery and a good cast helped in large measure by one small-time player Charles Buchinsky or Buchinski who was billed for the first time as Charles Bronson in DRUM BEAT and he certainly made a strong impact as Captain Jack a 'real life' character who in April 1873 really did kill General Canby, another peace commissioner, and wounded others.

8433274,4,B004KPC20W,"This is a better-than-average western, supposedly based on 'true' events.  Even if it were only in Italian (which it is not), and even with Anglos, e.g., Charles Bronson, (mis)playing native americans, it would be worth a look. The current product description is apt.",1373155200,,267,5.209302325581396
8433275,1,B004KPC20W,"When you purchase a film be sure to see that it is in English if that is your preference. Silly me had no idea there were different formats with U.S. and European. If I did indeed speak Italian the format still would not work in U.S. format. Long story short, when I purchased this it was money down the drain.",1348617600,,310,4.183333333333334
