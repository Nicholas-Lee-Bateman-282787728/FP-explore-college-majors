1394453,5,B000054OU1,My mother was pleased as punch with this assortment of older westerns! It was a gift to her for Christmas!,1211673600,,106,4.35
1394454,2,B000054OU1,"I don't know why the other reviews rated this disc so highly.  The package may say it is digitally MASTERED but it is NOT digitally REmastered!  There was no restoration work done on this disc whatsoever, and it shows.  The quality is barely passable, and probably was dubbed off older vhs tapes.  I think the other reviewers were just so ecstatic that these episodes were even available on DVD that their judgement got the best of them.  In summary, if you can find this disc for a couple of bucks go for it, otherwise, you'd be better off getting the Rifleman and Wagon Train on other DVD editions.",1100649600,41,600,4.518518518518518

1394457,5,B000054OU1,"During the 1950's these three shows became a family must see. For a whole generation of us born in the 40's and 50's this is a nostalgic trip back to a more innocent time. The quality of these recordings is excellent, keeping them in black and white is true to their time. Anyone wishing to revisit Rowdy Yates, Chuck Conner or Ward Bond will find these invaluable. It is amazing too see how simple the plots and the parts were, relying instead on our connection to the actors character. You won't want to miss it.",1005004800,24,514,4.421052631578948
1394458,5,B000054OU1,"I must tell you I thought I was getting only one episode on ""The Wagon Train"" and another one on the ""Death Valley Days"". To my delightful surprise, that is a double sided DVD and brings you not only two of the best tv classic westerns ever made, but four tv classic westerns: ""Death Valley Days"" (""Dear Teacher"" & ""Sego Lillies""); ""Wagon Train"" (""The Dr. Denker Story""); ""Bat Masterson"" (""The Fighter"" & ""Stampede at Tent City"") and ""The Rifleman"" (""Outlaw's Inheritance"" & ""Mail Order Groom""). Without a doubt, that is one of the best DVDs in my modest, but selected collection. It comes in a very nice case with short, but great information on the shows. It has an interactive menu, scene selector, dolby digital, trivia quiz and biography of the famous stars of the classic western shows in it. It was digitally mastered and was made in Canada. The 7 (seven) episodes on the DVD were nicely and competently chosen among the various good episodes on the shows. If you are a tv western classic fanatic like me or even if you want to have a really good DVD just added to your collection, that is a must!",992995200,89,1104,4.552763819095477

1394464,4,B000054OU1,TV Classic Westerns: Bat Masterson/Death Valley Days/The Rifleman/Wagon (1999) was very entertaining.  I would like to have seen more Death Valley Days and Bat Masterson since they are not available on television in the Atlanta area.  I recommend this item.,1358467200,,257,5.4

1394467,2,B000054OU1,"These 3 DVD were put together without much appreciation for the content,
I suppose they are better than nothing if you want to see one episode of Sugarfoot.
However poor old Rifleman does not seem to have a beginning middle or an end....
unless you like playing with your remote control a lot.",1281657600,2,293,4.547169811320755
1394468,3,B000054OU1,"Never forget the movie series that I grew up watching, and how much I enjoyed them. It would be nice for the generations now to take a comparison look at what was then to now; only now we are bombarded with so much unnecessary commercials to buy this product and they keep repeating the same things over and over as if we have a mental disability. These series remind me of the simplicity of life.",1270425600,,397,4.306666666666667

1394470,4,B000054OU1,"Boy, do these westerns bring back wonderful childhood memories of watching these on a Saturday morning.  I even found myself remembering the theme music and words for some.  Only drawback is that these are the originals, which is a good thing except they are quite grainy and not clear by today's standards.  Wish they had been digitally remastered. I would have enjoyed them more if they were clearer.  Still all in all they are still worth watching over and over again.  I sure do miss those Saturday mornings.",1238803200,,512,4.7727272727272725
