2996430,4,B000X1NDNW,"I have used both these programs on VHS and they work great!  This workout gave me visible results without making me sore or stiff - a rarety for me as I have back problems.  Tony does babble his way through the tape so once you get used to the routine you may want your own music playing in the background.  Overall I thought this was a great workout and is VERY do-able for people like me who are in no shape to get into shape.  Although I highly recommend this DVD set, it will likely be too low key for those who are already very physically fit.  These DVD's are great for slimming your tummy and just getting moving, but they are not going to thrill those who hit the gym 4 nights a week.",1197936000,3,692,4.0962962962962965

8226526,5,B000X1NDNW,Super fast shipping to the US and great product!!!,1458086400,,50,4.666666666666667
8226527,5,B000X1NDNW,It was a good movie. I don't understand why people are saying they don't talk very much in this movie they actually talk a lot in this movie. They just don't really talk while they are fighting. The English subtitles are a little strange at the introduction but after that it is easy to follow.,1455235200,,294,4.363636363636363
8226528,5,B000X1NDNW,honestly i really enjoyed this film a lot sad the only way to see it is to import a dvd or blu-ray from another country i don't understand why would they think we would find the religous convections in this film offensive,1452297600,,221,4.285714285714286
8226529,1,B000X1NDNW,"Horrible. This movie is so badly written, badly acted, and poorly conceived. It was a weird mix of ripped off concepts and effects from Avatar, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars: The Ohantom Menance and many other big effects movies. Don't waste your time or money.",1441756800,2,260,4.673913043478261
8226530,1,B000X1NDNW,a hot mess. not true to the original story and the changes make the ending illogical. special effects laughable.  English sub-titles a study in bad translation.  Acting was terrible.  should be zero stars.  don't waste your money.,1435536000,3,230,5.135135135135135
8226531,3,B000X1NDNW,"Wow! What can I say? Two iconic stars Donnie Yen and Yun-Fat Chow are in one movie, as well as Aaron Kwok and Kelly Chen. In fact, the star of the Chinese fantasy adventure film Monkey Magic is Donnie Yen as Sun Wukong (also known as The Monkey King), and the role of Yun-Fat Chow here is just an extended cameo.

Now, Monkey Magic features Donnie Yen, but don't expect something like intense martial arts combats. Donnie Yen, best known for his charismatic turn as martial artist Ip Man, has turned into The Monkey King with a help of special makeups. Born with formidable supernatural powers, Yens super-monkey yearns for more power and skills, but lacking in worldly wisdom, he is manipulated by Bull Demon King (Kwok) bent on revenge.

Donnie Yen delivers a very effective performance as good-natured but simple-minded Sun Wukong, but because of the underdeveloped story and the overuse of special effects (the film was shot in 3D), Monkey Magic lacks emotional impacts. Watching the talented stars in gorgeous costumes flying in the air is not boring, I admit, but for the film to be more engaging, we need something substantial, like a better story or fleshed-out characters.

As you know, Sun Wukong is the protagonist of a Chinese classic novel Journey to the West, which has spawned a lot of films and TV shows in Asia (including Stephen Chows recent Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons). Retelling a classic story everyone knows is not a bad idea, and it is fun to watch Donnie Yen as a gravity-defying monkey (and he has a romantic interest), but filmmakers need a better script for the planned sequel.",1433808000,3,1620,4.7785714285714285
8226532,3,B000X1NDNW,"A good time.  Very light on the acting, very heavy on the special effects.  The English subtitles are terrible.  It's very, very poorly translated, distractingly so.  But, since there's so little acting and dialogue, it's not a detriment to what is otherwise a lush and vivid CGI spectacular.  (And even with terrible translation, the dialogue is still better than anything in Avatar.)",1426464000,5,385,5.145161290322581
8226533,4,B000X1NDNW,Well done. This is how the story starts. Long time cominf.,1424563200,2,58,4.363636363636363
8226534,5,B000X1NDNW,These are great!  Bought them to replace my VHS.,1421798400,,48,4.333333333333333
