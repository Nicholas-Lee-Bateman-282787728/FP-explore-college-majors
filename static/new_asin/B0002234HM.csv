8020116,5,B0002234HM,I've been a big Yankee fan all my life and Yogi Berra was a hero of mine growing up in the 50's.  This is a great story of his life and how he became a great Yankee player.  I would recommend to any great Yankee fan or even a baseball fan!  Great job!,1278892800,2,251,3.69811320754717
8020117,4,B0002234HM,"Since there are no reviews here I felt I should say a few words.  This was given to me as a gift, I would have never bought it myself, as I've never been a Yankee fan.  But I am a fan of the history of the game, and this 1-hour documentary from 1999 celebrating Lawrence ""Yogi"" Berra reeled me in.  Yogi takes Bob Costas to the neighborhood in St. Louis where he grew up across the street from Joe Garagiola (you meet Yogi's childhood friends but not Joe... why?), you get interviews with the likes of Ted Williams, Phil Rizutto, Jim Bouton, Joe Torre, Yogi's 3 sons, and cameos from many others, you get vintage baseball footage (in slo-mo, Jackie Robinson looks out on 2 separate steals where he was called safe!), you get a slew of malaprops (my favorite I don't remember hearing before is when Yogi steps up to the plate to hit, the opposing catcher tells him he's the ugliest guy he's ever seen, and Yogi says ""So what? You don't hit the ball with your face!""), and you find out how he got his nickname.  You feel Yogi's pain when he talks about getting fired from his manager position(s), and you see Steinbrenner apologize to him on camera.  Bonus features include longer interviews with Williams and Rizutto.

This is a MUST-SEE for Yankee fans, and fans of Yogi Berra, and for fans of baseball from its ""classic"" days, the '40s-'60s.  I'm glad I saw it and you will be too.  And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",1271203200,6,1421,4.376425855513308
