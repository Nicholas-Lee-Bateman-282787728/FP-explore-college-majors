But I like movies Hollywood style.  If you are like me, you won't like this at all.  If you are more the intellectual movie type, you probably will like it.",1048204800,8,333,4.39344262295082
1652703,5,B00005R247,"There is only one word to describe this movie: Uncanny. The director has hypnotized the actors.  They meander through the movie,lost and not quite at home, their blank stares leaving imprints on the consciousness of the viewer.  Not a gimmick. Much too complex to be a gimmick. The intense visual imagery, characteristic of all herzog movies, is in this movie the most haunting and unnerving.  It may not be as sound in plot, or as epic as Fitzcarraldo or Kaspar Hauser, but for people who don't need something substantial to happen every 5 seconds in a film (and so those who don't suffer from television or hollywood induced Attention Deficit Disorder)Heart of Glass no doubt will be a force of visual fury, done subtly but surely, evoking the uncanny upon each viewing.",1047945600,10,772,4.833333333333333
1652704,5,B00005R247,"An excellent commentary with Werner Herzog is included in this DVD, and unravels the mysteries of the film to some degree.  On initial viewing the acting style appears stylised to the point of bafflement, but then Herzog explains that most of the cast were hypnotised prior to their scenes.  Why do this, one might ask, and here Herzog demurs, simply offering the obscure comment that 'the story' suggested that this would be an effective idea; he also admits to knowing little about hypnotism prior to shooting, and that once the idea occurred to him then he researched the topic!  For all his intellect, this is one instinctual film-maker.
*
Herzog also gives some autobiographical information that is fascinating:  he was raised in the Bavarian countryside, near the Austrian border, and lived in a house with no modern facilities whatsoever - it was unheated, there was no television, and not even a telephone - in fact he made his first telephone call at the age of seventeen - even today he says he has 'trouble' communicating over the phone.  He saw his first movie around this age, and not long after started to make his own.  He praises the circumstances of his childhood as conducive to the development of an imagination - the children had to invent their own stories and their own games.  I'm not sure how 'explanatory' this is, after all he was the only one of his community to become a reknowned film-maker as far as I'm aware.
*
The story is simple and timeless.  A secret is lost, in this case the process by which glass is made ruby red, and grave consequences follow.  Herzog would not be drawn on the question of what else this could represent, but clearly was sympathetic to it being allegorical - what was lost could also be faith, or innocence, or purpose.
*
He travelled far and wide to obtain the particular landscapes featured, and he hopes these will evoke deep, archetypal, feelings in viewers.  His journeys ranged to Alaska, Yellowstone Park, and Ireland, and yet he considers all these landscapes as 'Bavarian' in terms of their abstract spirit.  He also, rather casually, mentions spending hours waiting for the right light to film certain scenes, and days capturing the stop-motion photography of clouds.  No effort appeared too great to fulfill his vision (hardly a surprise if you've seen his South American films, 'Aguirre' and 'Fitzcarraldo').
*
For mine, one element of discord is the music, by Popul Vuh - Herzog obviously has a soft spot for this but it does sound terribly dated and is incongruous with the eighteenth century setting (think very bad imitation of Mahavishnu Orchestra).
*
The pacing of the film is slow, in keeping with the trance-affected acting.  Unsurprisingly, the film did well in Scandanavia, while in America audiences reportedly found it difficult.  Herzog himself seems intrigued by how time flows, or fails to, upon the screen.  The cast features enough misshapen physiognomies to warm the cockles of Fellini or David Lynch.  The lighting and cinematography are superb, as is the DVD transfer.
*
Herzog considers himself primarily a story-teller.  He wants to tell his stories in ways previously untried.  He is an adventurer in life and on film.  He is a visionary, in many senses of the term.  Personally, this is not my favourite of his films, and I think the experiment with hypnotism is something of a failure dramatically, but nevertheless he has created a work of art that is unique and endlessly open to interpretation.  Five stars in the context of the world of film as a whole, but if you have not seen one of his films before then I think 'Stroszek', 'The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser', or 'Aguirre, Wrath of God' are more representative of his work.",1019347200,7,3721,4.8283464566929135
1652705,5,B00005R247,"I bought this DVD because I was intrigued by the description of a small village gripped by insanity following the death of a glassmaker.  But when I watched it I immediately dubbed it horrible.  I felt as though it had killed me.
After that night, though, I couldn't get the pictures out of my head.  I could vividly recall scenes from the film, and as they  played out in my mind they seemed so beautiful.  The more I thought, the more I realized that I had merely watched the movie with the wrong idea, expecting something that it was not.  The attitude of the movie became clear to me.  When I watched it the second time I was stunned by how amazingly well the stupor and dazed madness of the town was portrayed.  The events and actions of the characters engulfed me and drew me into the story.  The hypnotic trance of the actors provides an effect I have never seen before.  This truly is a great film if you are prepared for it.",1017187200,26,933,4.310344827586207
1652748,4,B00005R247,"German filmmaker Werner Herzog is not an artist to be underestimated, even in his lesser films, like 1976's Heart Of Glass (Herz Aus Glaus) because his films tend to have a cumulative power, in that they get better with each successive viewing. Ok, technically, the films are the same, but because they are so dense, layered, and multifarious, an appreciation and understanding of them is almost inevitable with a second or third viewing- one of the benefits that foreign films, and films with DVD commentaries afford and reward viewers with. The film in the Herzog canon this most reminds me of is his Even Dwarfs Started Small, another film that is so `out there' it holds a fascination over the viewer, even if it fails to achieve greatness, or even coherence.
  Heart Of Glass combines the quirkiness of Even Dwarfs Started Small with the somnambulism of Night Of The Living Dead, the landscapes of the fictive Lord Of The Rings trilogy (albeit without the benefit of any special effects), and the period eye level realism of Herzog's own The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser. The oft-repeated legend behind the film, propagated relentlessly by the notoriously tall tale telling Herzog, is that he personally hypnotized the whole cast, and one can almost believe it, given the leaden, faraway way the actors recite their lines. Yet, the film veers between this living cross between a marionette show and Noh theater and stunning musical interludes featuring the gorgeous landscapes (mountains, clouds, and waterfalls) of Bavaria and Alaska, often shot through gauzey filters that render the natural imagery as almost moving paintings upon a canvas; one designed to likewise lull the viewer into a mesmerized state. It is also like crossing mime with MTV music videos, only without having to laugh.... As usual, the music in the film, from the opening yodeling, to what seems to be monastic chanting, to the playing of a hurdy-gurdy, is excellent, and arranged by Popol Vuh's Florian Fricke. The cinematography, by Jrg Schmidt-Reitwein, as mentioned, is stunning, and many aspects of this film- from that cinematography, to certain odd sequences, such as a `bar fight' between Wudy and Ascherl, where they break glass steins and pour beer over one another, or a later scene where Wudy dances with Ascherl's corpse, just lodge jaggedly in one's psyche, which show that the hypnotizing of the cast was something more than a mere `gimmick' to sell the film. Also of note, in the cast, is an early Herzog cast regular, the dwarfish Clemens Scheitz, as the Master's man-servant, Adalbert. Thus, the film falls into that class of art beyond a good or bad axis, and onto one that is simply `interesting' or `worthwhile,' for it is not a masterpiece- as it is too unstructured and narratively anomic, nor is it a bad film- as it is too laden with great images and jaggedly lodged moments.
  Heart Of Glass is a film that seems to call out for critical dissection, even as such a task would rob the film of its ineffable power, such as poetic scenes of glassblowers attempting to replicate the Ruby Glass formula, or a scene of an ugly and retarded girl named Paulin dancing topless on a table with a duck that seems to have the beak wattle of a chicken or turkey. there is nothing that prepares one for such an image, but once it has been unreeled, there is no putting the proverbial genies back in the glass. That Heart Of Glass is only 94 minutes long is both a good and bad thing: good, for the tedium of some of the somnambulism bores, and bad, for the images could hold one's fascination for hours- sort of like Godfrey Reggio's -Quatsi films do, only even more powerful. Werner Herzog shows, in this film, that a great artist can still touch greatness in works that are not his best, but it is the fact that a film like this, clearly in the lower half of the Herzog canon, is still leagues better than all but the top ten or twelve films put out by the American film marketing machine which proves that Herzog's work will live as long as, or longer than, the many legends his masterful films retell.",1221091200,,4091,4.749648382559775
1652749,5,B00005R247,"This is amongst the most poetic, mysterious, and mystical films Werner Herzog has ever given us (and for him, that's saying something).  Many have recounted the story behind the production that all of the cast (except the lead actor) were hypnotized before shooting.  It gives the actors another worldly appearance.  I really love the soundtrack by Popol Vuh.  The opening scenes from this film are amongst the most beautiful I've ever seen in a film, with Popol Vuh's music giving such a deep, majestic feel to the film.  The film was based on a Bavarian legend about a glass maker who died without leaving his secrets, and the townspeople went insane aftewards.  The film is really told mostly through imagery and sound.  Dialogue here seems incidental.  Herzog was on a tear in the 1970's, making brilliant film after brilliant film.  He lost a little bit of his ""mojo"" after Fitzcarraldo, but since has gained it back with some amazing documentaries.  This is Herzog's most underrated film, one that grows stranger and mysterious with each consecutive viewing.",1175558400,2,1064,4.994318181818182
1652750,5,B00005R247,"All of us are aware about the powerful imagination and fascinating spell of this unique filmmaker. In this movie Herzog displays his portentous creativity to engage us with a new world, sort of dreamy landscapes, arresting images and steady dialogue.

 The humble people of a small village attempt for all their means to find and learn the formula to make a special glass; we have a wandering herdsman, who represents a shaman in the darkness of the vulgarity and ordinariness; take all your time for watch and delight this peerless movie, that constitutes at least to my mind (I have seen almost Herzog's works) one of the most the most poetic, captiavating and mesmerizing films in years.

You won't believe what you will see in the epilogue, with those unforgettable images.

Hypnotic all the way through!",1170806400,2,808,4.919117647058823
1652751,4,B00005R247,"Famous as the film where all but one cast member was hypnotized by its director, Heart of Glass is another of Werner Herzog's almost ethereal looks at damaged, alienated (indeed, almost alien) protagonists completely unsuited for the world around them. In this case it's an entire pre-industrial town where the secret of making the ruby glass that the local economy depends on has been lost, and with it the townspeople have lost all will to live and wander around in a somnambulist daze reminiscent of an entire community of Clive Owens: well, a slightly livelier Clive Owen at least, if such a thing can be possibly imagined. Only the local shepherd-cum-prophet is immune from the spell, his real prophecies a mixture of the strikingly pertinent and the truly nonsensical. Naturally, this being Herzog, a chicken does feature briefly, although whether it also is hypnotised is open to debate. It should be horribly and unwatchably self-indulgent, but the strikingly beautifully photographed tableaux and the weird poetry in its soul turns it into a dreamlike experience you drift through almost benignly despite the darkness, madness, violence and hopeless stupidity on display.

Aside from trailer, production notes and stills gallery, the main extra is another one of Herzog's excellent audio commentaries.",1159747200,2,1310,5.298076923076923
1652752,5,B00005R247,"The essential metaphor which beats at the heart of glass, is the terrible and frightening fragility of existence.  Hias the prophet,  sees a future in which not only the village is engulfed in flames, but the world itself, he foresees the raise of nazism and like a good many Herzog productions the echoes of fascism reverberate. This is a village in which the capitalist dictator who owns the glass factory, can enter peoples houses on a whim and take their property, and can almost get away with murder. That murder, insanity and death should hang palpably over this film is no accident; the glass is red for a reason as it represents the very life essence of the village, with the demise of its vital ingredient, so the village slowly dies. Herzog's articulation of this mass breakdown is rendered beautifully, in a way which is quite simply painterly. Whether one considers the hypnotism of many cast members a gimmick or not, the result is perhaps the most accurately displayed example of mass hysteria committed to celluloid. There is an abyss at the centre of the film, which the audience itself finds itself walking into. A sense of somnambulism which emerges out of the screen. Structurally this is a confusing film, jumping all over the place, no regard for time or space - which gives it a dream logic perfect to the content of the film. The forces of creation and destruction are at work in this film and in many ways it is reminiscent of FATA MORGANA. Like  the earlier film HEART OF GLASS is challenging and disturbing and in my opinion has the greatest opening 10 minutes in cinema. Wonderfully obtuse, wonderfully mythical - Herzog's finest moment.",1152662400,2,1664,4.770833333333333
1652753,2,B00005R247,"'Heart of Glass' was quite the daring experiment from the extraordinary German filmmaker Werner Herzog.  He hypnotized all the actors except one man; a mystic who is trying to save a village from destroying itself.  The scenery is stunning and so is the music.  The yodeling at the begging of the film is hair-raising and unforgettable.  Other than that, 'Heart of Glass' does not make any sense, espicially the last scene.  The final scene has nothing to do with the main story.  The final scene has nothing to do with anything in general.  Also, the hypnotized actors look goofy and silly most of the time rather than being in a trance-like state.  It is a good thing when artists try to experiment like this, but in this case, I would consider the experiment a failure.  Watch some other Herzog films, especially the ones with Klaus Kinski.",1140307200,,843,4.719178082191781
1652754,5,B00005R247,"It's not a veiled secret that the actors in this movie were hypnotized before the camera started rolling.  If  you didn't know that already then you'd catch it in the commentary.  Similarly, the viewer feels hypnotized as well.  There is a sense of impending doom that clouds over this film and the audience can feel it.  Yet, like the actors the audience can't bear to look away from what is transpiring on the screen.  Somehow, Herzog is a master at including beautiful landscape shots in his films and this film is no exception starting out with a great sequence full of nature shots.  What comes after that is much more interesting and natural, to me anyway.  Herzog also has a way of capturing a fiction that feels documentary to the way the undercurrent of life can sometimes go.  His ablility to expose this is one thing that makes him great.  This film may seem less essential to the person who loves his commonly held classics like ""Aguirre: the wrath of God"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Woyzek,""  but it still carries the Herzog standard of quality and I find it more interesting than the other films simply because I feel it skims across a more interesting terrain that otherwise wouldn't be exposed.",1112313600,11,1203,4.708133971291866
1652755,3,B00005R247,"I've seen and read Werner Herzog in interviews, like in his own film ""My Best Fiend"" (about his relationship with Klaus Kinski) and in interviews conducted by Roger Ebert. Both times Herzog comes off as a likeable guy. Someone full of interesting stories and jokes. He seems to be a very amusing fellow, and then you watch one of his films expecting that personality you just saw to be evident in his films, but it's not. That, for me, is one of the werid things about watching a Werner Herzog film. I find I am incapble of caring too much about his characters. I'm always left feeling slightly cheated, disappointed. I don't feel so strong about it that I would give one of his movies 1 or 2 stars, but it prevents me from giving them 4 or 5. Of the films I have seen I enjoy ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Nosferatu"" the most. Those would be 4 star movies. But the rest of his films are middle of the road to me. They start off promising and then never quite deliver.

 What it all comes down to is this. If you examining the collection of films Herzog has made it is quite impressive. ""Aguirre:Wrath of God"", ""Woyzeck"", and this film, he seems to have made quite different films than you would get from the mainstream. And that's a good thing. But when you examine the films on their own, Herzog's film world doesn't seem as powerful. His films have strenght in number so to speak.

 All of Herzog movies are about obsession. They usually revolve around men battling nature. You could say his movies are about male dominance. What I find off puting about his films is the fact I can never relate to their obsessions. I never feel as if I'm going along on their journey.

 ""Heart of Glass"" tells the story of a town known for making ruby glass, but when the man who made the glass dies, he never revealed his secret how to do with it, the town begins to go a bit over the top. One man, known as ""The Master"", how's that for male dominance, becomes obsessed trying to find the secret.

 The movie's highpoints lie in the cinematography which captures some truly beautiful shots. The movie's tone tries to create a peaceful scenery and have that clash with the violence of the characters.

 If you've seen Werner Herzog's films before, you know what to expect. And you will probably enjoy this film. If however, you are not familiar with his work, be prepared to see something truly different. A Herzog film can not be compared to anything else but another Herzog film. No director does what he does.

 Bottom-line: Typical Werner Herzog film dealing with his usual wacky group of characters that makes it hard for us to relate to, mixed up with some beautiful cinematography.",1111104000,2,2665,4.5062240663900415
1652756,5,B00005R247,"Herzog is a master of the off-beat (though I cannot recommend some of his recent films like 'Cobra Verde and 'Invincible'). His approach in 'Heart of Glass' is experimental and strangely beautiful. It has a sort of contemplative, mystical feel - with some of the greatest imagery put to film since the silent era. Along with Tarkovsky, Herzog is one of the greatest directors at capturing atmosphere and completely absorbing his audience with it - whether or not they are prepared for such a journey. I am not at all surprized by some of the negative reviews of this film - as it is out of the ordinary - but for me it is out of the ordinary in a transcendental way - like all great works of art.",1099008000,4,696,4.403100775193798
1652757,3,B00005R247,"For once I am (almost) speechless. I just don't know how I feel about this film yet. I am a fan of Herzog, but this exists in its own universe and aside from pacing seems unlike other films of his I have seen. Bear in mind that I only saw this last night and have not viewed it with the commentary yet.
I must say that at first I found it almost laughable-- a sort of stereotypical excersize in Germanic avant-garde, cynical, impenetrable arthouse schtick. I thought it would make excellent fodder for a spoof ala Saturday Night Live's ""Schprockets"" skits. However, I could never once take my eyes from the screen and as it progressed I felt surrounded by the images and characters. As another reviewer said, they disliked the film at first but found later that they were haunted my scenes from the film. It is a lot like that. It is a lot like being hypnotized, which appears to have been an aim of Herzog's. Upon reflection, the only thing that really bothered me about the film is that the Popol Vuh music during some segments seemed out of place. I tend to like it when period pieces retain period music.
This is not a movie that many in America would find enjoyable, where there must be explicit sex or a shootout or car chase within the first five minutes for it to be acceptable to the popular palette. But for those oh-so-pretentious ""aht"" types, this is drool fuel, and for those more reasoned and critical lovers of film and admirers of Herzog, this simply must be seen. Perhaps the most enigmatic film I have ever watched. It is beyond loving it or hating it, thus the 3 stars. The film is here. It exists, and now is lodged in my subconscious forever. I don't know how to feel about that.",1048809600,14,1700,4.417197452229299

You have to make do with an ugly duckling of a duck, a ugly duckling of a woman who does a kind of medieval striptease, Nostradamus (or his Germanic ex-soldier and herdsman equivalent), Lawrence Llewelyn-Bowen, the cast of Last of the Summer Wine seen through a distorting mirror, a very large craggy island and four men in a boat (there is a dog ealier on and a particularly vicious ugly looking terrier) representing the pointlessness of hoping for some kind of deliverence. The seer seems to be warning about the horrors of the twentieth century coming about through the abandonment of tradition or the lack of trust we have for one another. You can't really put it in to words without study and a Phd, so for the average viewer you have to see it as some kind of 'automatic' film-making which is akin to poetry produced by a drug-induced or trance-induced plumbing of a collective subconscious.

7951639,2,B00005R247,"Well, I'm a Herzog completist, so I am nearly done with my quest of collecting and watching all his movies.  There's only a couple of I haven't seen, and those are shorts.

This one is from Herzog's early phase.  Its plot concerns a small town in Bavaria whose economy is based on a unique method of glass-blowing.  When the last one to possess this secret dies, the economy collapses and the town descends into madness.  It's not a documentary.

The movie is famous for the following unusual directing technique:  nearly all of the principal actors were hypnotized before delivering their lines in nearly all of the scenes.

This is one of those ideas that must have worked better on paper than it did once it was in the can.  I'm sure, while filming, Herzog was quite taken with himself and how art critics would swoon over this approach, but for me, what matters is the final result, not so much the story behind the final result.

Hence what we really have is a bunch of actors delivering their lines in dopey monotones.  The whole thing would have been a lot better, I imagine, if Herzog had merely told those actors to act like they were hypnotized:  this would have created the same eerie effect, but been more watchable.",1264723200,,1228,4.58256880733945

Such self-indulgence hurts Hrzzog's reputation and his credibility.  The garbage he spews in the commentary is even worse.  If you bought the Herzog collection, throw out this disk and enjoy the others. The film is a mess with no redeeming value.  The nonsense spewed in the favorable reviews is beyond belief.",1234656000,,445,4.88
7951641,3,B00005R247,"I was interested to read that the actors in this film were ""hypnotized."" I don't think that's technically true--but there IS a cataleptic feel to the staging & the acting. There was also a ""freakish"" quality to the actors physical appearance & their bizarre characterization.

Certainly it is a very ""different"" kind of horror flick.

Half way through, however, I started noticing just how many styles the director was ""borrowing"" from. There was obvious Bergman, Fellini; there was expressionism, existentialism & surrealism. These are all very interesting influences to be sure, but there was just TOO MUCH, too much stylization & too much indebtedness to other directors, writers & scripts.

This mish-mash of styles wasn't so irksome that it wasn't interesting to watch, but it all leads to a totally illogical & unsatisfying conclusion that just doesn't fit.

I think this would be a good film for students of Film Making 101.

People who like quirky films should check it out.

I gave it 3 stars because it is so strange & there are certain scenes I would like to view again--but not the whole thing",1231459200,,1105,4.913978494623656
7951642,3,B00005R247,"Upon reading the plot synopsis of Werner Herzog's ""Heart of Glass"", one might be fooled into expecting a rather straightforward narrative, albeit with Herzog's characteristic lingering and glacial pacing, and his fascination with staggering footage of the natural world.  One would be fooled indeed with this film, as it is anything but straightforward, and can barely be called a narrative at all.  Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but forewarned is forearmed, so they say.

I do not believe there is much point in a reductionist critique of this film, no reason to point to a particular scene and attempt to divine Herzog's intention.  A film like this works as a whole, or fails.  This one fails, much like the man who has an extremely vivid dream fails when he tries to describe it the next day.  Frankly, I had a difficult time making it through the entire movie, though I was able, as if sleepwalking, to finish.

I don't know what Herzog was trying to accomplish with this film, and he didn't engage me enough to spend any more time trying to figure it out.  His efforts such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stroszek/dp/B000059PPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stroszek</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre-the-Wrath-of-God/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>&nbsp;are far more captivating and thought provoking because he gives the viewer something to work with instead of the mish-mash that is ""Heart of Glass"".

There are three reasons I gave this film the middle of the road ranking of three stars.  The first has to do with an extraordinary scene in the middle of the story - very closely resembling documentary footage - of a circle of glass blowers working around a single, mammoth furnace.  This scene, relative to the story but in no way advancing it, went on for at least five minutes, but was some of the most entrancing screen time of the entire movie.  The second was the ending, which some reviewers called an epilogue.  I suppose that is technically true, since it had nothing to do with the rest of the story, but since so many of the scenes seemed to have little to do with one another, this last was scarcely out of place.  I won't go into detail, but I thought it perhaps entailed all of the elements Herzog was attempting throughout the movie, except done in a way that was engaging to me personally.  I began to think that all of his diversions, all of the seeming random bits thrown in were his way of saying that everything is connected - nothing can be considered without examining each thread, each tangent, even if the limits of filmmaking allow this only for one brief lingering moment.

Lastly, though this film fails, I think it's important that there are directors who risk failure, and who, even in their failure, still produce efforts that challenge viewers to see the world through their lens.  In Herzog's case, and in ""Heart of Glass"" particularly, there are no visual cues as to what the viewer should be feeling or experienceing - we're asked to come up with that all on our own.  That isn't the type of entertainment most of the world expects or wants.  There will always be only a dedicated minority for a film like this.
