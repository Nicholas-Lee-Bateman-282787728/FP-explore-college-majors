BUT it did NOT  play on any of my DVD players (standard) in my House ..It played on my computer , which suggests it is NOT region free .. great stuff tho;  raw and live UK style  Ska ..i'm a big Fan of the 'Godfather of Ska' The Late Great ..Laurel Aitken.  I wish I could play this on my big stereo system .. buyer be aware .",1144281600,,402,3.75
