7970907,5,B00006K04R,"These excerpts are from Red's final year (1970-71) on network television with NBC.  They are from the master tapes, so the video and sound quality are excellent.  They are released from the Skelton family trust.
Some might argue that Red's NBC show was not up to the former years on CBS, and I guess I would agree.  The skits were not as good, perhaps because the half hour format did not allow for a plot to develop.  So, often, instead of a story line you had a skit.  However, some of the segments are very good, and some of the Silent Spots are superb.  I would have preferred a bit more of the monologues, but there are some nice representations.
This is the best quality to come out from Red's television series, so if you're a fan this is a must.  In fact, even if you just love comedy but don't know much about Red Skelton, this is a must.  I gaurantee you'll become a fan.
Goodnight, and may God bless.",1035849600,31,911,4.286549707602339
