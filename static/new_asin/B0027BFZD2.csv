8354391,5,B0027BFZD2,A brilliant and diffificult tour the force. Except by the weak and predictable endind (both of them) it could be classified as a gay Antonioni.,1359331200,,143,4.76
8354392,2,B0027BFZD2,"""Daybreak"" is a lovestory between a closet case, married guy and another gay, who is not afraid of his feelings.
They meet once in a while in a beach house that belongs to the parents of the married one.
Not only different approach to own sexuality creates gap between them, but also their material status.
It could have been quite good film, if only some scenes weren't that slow. Even if the director intended to create ""a special atmosphere"", the result seems to disappoint.
Poor quality of subtitles (the moment actors speak ""broken english"", the translation is gone) makes it more difficult to understand it.

8354393,3,B0027BFZD2,"After having seen the DVD from Waterbearer like the previous reviewer I feel that something is missing from the film. It does not portray the relationship as if it is the final night and certainly it does not indicate that these two people have had an on and off relationship as some reviewers have suggested. I think it is due to the DVD having only a 66 mins running time when the box quotes the running time as 75 mins. Secondly some scenes seen on the trailer are not included in the film. I do not think we are seeing the film as it should be. There must be cuts somewhere. I have written to Waterbearer, but have not obtained a satisfactory answer. Any ideas from those who have seen both the theatrical release and the DVD. Are there any discrepancies?",1268265600,4,759,4.390070921985815
8354394,3,B0027BFZD2,"***  NO ENGLISH SUBTITLING ***
NO matter how beautifully filmed. NO matter how beautiful you actors are.
NO matter how good the story is,  IF YOUR ENGLISH SPEAKING CUSTOMERS can't
understand a word you actors are saying,  WE LOSE 90% OF THE STORY.
  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 5 STARS FOR CINEMATIC BEAUTY ALONE, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ANYONE SAID.
 PLEASE RESTORE ** SUBTITLING ** TO YOU CINEMATIC OFFERINGS.",1250553600,3,405,4.714285714285714
