2314782,5,B0009S2T0W,"I went to see OLDBOY last night, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best movie I've seen all year.

I went in expecting some Asian-style actioner. Instead, it was dark, twisted, visually interesting, violent and pretty much genius.

The plot, which I won't divulge much of here since the joy is in discovering what the movie is about, is excellent. The movie's graphic and intense.

OLDBOY is based on this manga, so Edmondson and I were expecting some sort of light, funny, hero-driven, martial arts actioner when we headed to it last night. It's nothing like that. Edmondson kept pointing out that he thought it was funny how I wanted to see a ""gritty, Asian revenge thriller"" about a guy who is imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years for unknown reasons by unknown people - and then, upon getting out of his prison, tracks down his captors for answers.

There were moments of violence where I just kept saying to myself, ""Dude ... Dude ...,"" gripping on to the armrest, for it was intense and incredibly clever. And I don't even say ""Dude."" It was wicked. It was sick. It was fantastic.

Highly, highly recommended.",1116979200,7,1120,4.636363636363637
2314783,5,B0009S2T0W,"This film blew me away,its the most original idea i've seen in years. I found nothing wrong with this film the cast the acting, the whole idea was truly astonishing. I loved every second of this mind puzzling suspense thriller, it keeps you wondering from the very start til the final climax. A man taken without reason, imprisoned for 15 years. Released without reason, five days to seek the turth. I feel that any movie go-er will love this movie to bits.",1116374400,7,457,4.585365853658536
2314784,5,B0009S2T0W,"Old boy by Chan-wook Park is the only evidence of God I have ever seen in cinema. This film is perfect. Period. Every single element of this film is flawless. It is raw, chiseled, perfection. The PLOT. The cast. The directing. The music. The set design. The cinematography. The acting. The Foley artists. The choreography. This film is a masterpiece. It is pristine. It is the very paragon of cinema as we know it. This film should be cherished. Revered. Adored..., perhaps even worshiped.

Chan-wook Park has created something that simply can not be glorified enough by mere words. Please see this wonder of cinema before Hollywood gets its bloody, thieving, insipid, ruinous, GREEDY hands on it. There is talk of a remake, which I must say, makes me physically ill! Was it not enough that there were American remakes of Juon and Ringu and Dark Water? Now they have to think of corrupting the BEST FILM EVER MADE? Please God NO! I am begging all the powers that be, to please crush the infidels who dare trespass upon the sanctified celluloid of Old Boy.

And to all you movie fans who read this, please, see Chan-wook Parks ORIGINAL MASTERPIECE in all it's horrific, malevolent, stark, beautiful, glory, before Hollywood gets it's miserable, putrid, pathetic little hands on it. LONG LIVE CHAN-WOOK PARK'S OLD BOY! May it reign forever in it's sublime, unparalleled excellence.",1115337600,20,1379,4.888888888888889
2314785,3,B0009S2T0W,"My threshold for violence on screen is pretty high. In fact I would say that American cinema would do better if it had more of it. That said I still had to draw the line with this movie at the point when the main character cut his own tongue off with scissors. It wasn't that my face was cramped from the disgusted look I had on my face (which I did have), it was that the scene was not necessary.  Nothing leading up to that would make me believe that his only option would be to cut his tongue off. It was tongue cutting for the sake of tongue cutting.  I can believe the scene involving the live squid, but not the tongue. I have been on a bit of a mission lately to figure out what is going on in Asian cinema lately and I really don't think I've gotten that close. The best I can tell they are either beating themselves to a bloody pulp (""Ichi the Killer"") or they are doing nothing at all (""What Time is it There""). And along the way they refuse to give into narrative structure. Again something Hollywood could learn from, but showing us why Hollywood has the conventions they do have. In ""Oldboy"" Dae-su Oh is captured and held prisoner for 15 years. Why? Well when they do tell you it is a let down. So he decides to get him some revenge. . .makes sense to me.  But this film is not content to be an average revenge flick. So they throw in sub-plots involving mind control and high school and ticking clocks of doom. That's all fine if you know how to execute it, but I'm sorry to say in this film Chan-wook Park fails.  It's not often that I see a foreign film and think that it was pandering to 13 year old boys, but the violence and sex in this film really makes me wonder. The only part of the love story between Dae-su Oh and his girlfriend that was fleshed out was the sex scene. The rest of the time he can't decide whether to save her from the evil villains or kill her himself. I liked his visual imagery, I was especially fond of the ways he showed the passing of time while Dae-su Oh was locked up, but the storytelling was not up to par. Thus by the time we get to the part where the tongue is removed I was bored and disgusted, not a good combination. **3/4",1114992000,2,2179,4.12
2314786,5,B0009S2T0W,"I wasn't expecting much before i saw but once i did, i realized that i really enjoyed this film. The plot is done really nicely and the acting is superb. I've had the experience of watching an east-european copy with voiceovers and perhaps something was lost in translation. I recommened searching for the region-free DVD on ebay.com as i am not sure when this movie will be released in theaters.",1113955200,2,396,4.671428571428572
2314787,4,B0009S2T0W,"Taken from a Korean comic book, Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su who is kidnapped by persons unknown in front of a phone booth and imprisoned for 15 years.  During the ensuing years, he tries in vain to learn why he was kidnapped, learns that his wife is brutally murdered and that he's the main suspect, and builds up such hatred for those who have imprisoned him that once he's out, he is determined to seek revenge.  Finally, after 15 years, he wakes up stuffed inside a trunk on a rooftop.  He frees himself and staggers about the town, stopping in front of a restaurant window to look at the fresh fish.  A bum walks up to him, hands him a wallet full of cash and a cell phone, then walks away.  From that point begins a twisted tale of secrets and revenge as Dae-su tries to piece together in five days who kidnapped him and why.  Choi Min-sik gives a fantastic performance as Dae-su; he just exudes restrained anger and confusion in his desparation to discover the truth.  Yoo Ji-tae is equally villainous and calculating with his performance.  Park's direction gives the entire film a gritty, film-noir feel that stays with you as he delves into just how far a human being will go to exact revenge and its consequences.  A very dark and violent roller coaster of a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.",1113609600,7,1307,4.504237288135593
2314788,5,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy has a Shakespearian tone as it depicts the tale of Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), whose name means ""he who can get along with people"".  Oh Dae-su is on his way home after having been arrested for public drunkenness to celebrate his daughters birthday.  However, Oh Dae-su never arrives to his home as he is kidnapped and imprisoned in a small room where his only contact with the human world is a television.  During the time Oh Dae-su is caged someone murders his wife and he becomes the prime suspect for the murder.  The questions that Oh Dae-su unsuccessfully attempts to answer while locked up is why revenge is being taken on him and who is seeking this cruel revenge.  After 15 years Oh Dae-su is released from his torturous imprisonment, which leaves him confused and ragingly vengeful.

Chan-wook Park directs a brilliant cinematic experience that is full of well-written conspiring intrigues that will keep the audience in suspense.  The suspense is initiated in the opening shot where a man is hanging over the edge of a roof top causing the audience to asks themselves--why is this happening?  The suspense continues as new and mysterious clues appears, but apprehension does not leave the audience even after the end of the film as the final line echos in the minds of the audience.  Park's vision of revenge in Oldboy often depicts exaggerated violence that is well balanced with story as it is related to the themes of the film.  However, this should serve as a warning to squeamish folks as the film is occasionally brutal and bizarre.  Furthermore, the cinematography used in Oldboy vividly projects the emotional tone of the cinematic themes and characters.  The characters are also superbly performed by an excellent cast, which will help the audience to experience a first class cinematic event.",1113091200,173,1817,4.921311475409836
2314789,3,B0009S2T0W,"At first, there was no way that I was going to see this film.  But when Roger Ebert gave it four stars, I became curious.  I do wonder how does Korean film differentiate itself, or copy, cinema from Hong Kong or Japan.  I am not sure how well this film answered this for me.

In ""Crouching Tiger, "" ""Hero,"" and other Asian films that Americans have embraced, fight scenes are the focus of the film and they are done beautifully, in an almost balletic fashion.  Here, there was only one fight scene.  It was incidental to the film and it was not visually- or physically-pleasing in the slightest.  Perhaps this is one way my aforementioned question is answered.

Great Expectations

I think Americans get the chance to see many views of Japan and China (or at least the Red Square).  Though South Korea is a developed nation, you rarely see it in the news.  It was fascinating to see Korean skyscrapers, highways, and even dirty neighborhoods.  Equally fascinating was seeing Koreans using cellphones and instant messaging as much as Americans do.  There's franglais, Spanglish, Polglish, Singlish, and much more.  I don't know what a mix of Korean and English would be called, but the characters do a lot of code-switching here.

This is a complicated work.  Its non-linear sequences, rough sex, and painful subject matter make it a difficult viewing.  The subtitles became blurry at times.  I don't know if the theater just had a bad copy of the film or if the Korean producers wanted to make Anglophone viewers suffer.  Some viewers may be let down that the film is not that suspenseful or a thriller.  The protagonist finds evidence in his quest easily and with few surprises.  This movie shows self-mutilation, masochism, suicide, sexual harassment, dismemberment, and a whole host of outr'e matters.  Just as ""Amores Perros"" proves that Mexico is not as conservative and easily-read as some pose, this film asserts the same about South Korea.

Lone Star

I thought the female lead fell in love to easily, but I was glad that she was not depicted in the infantilizing, sexist manner that often happens in Japanese film and anime.  The main character has big, bushy hair like Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, minus the grays.  Actually, many things for which I could not turn off my disbelief were explained or intimated by the end of the film.  I predicted the twist in the film, but I imagine that many others will not.  In fact, the film's ultimate conclusion may really disturb viewers.  I highly doubt this film could ever have been made in the United States (though I am sure it could have been made in Europe).

There is a new book called ""The Remasculinization of Korean Film"" by Kyung Hyun Kim.  I tried to ask myself what this film said about Korean manhood.  However, I think the film was not interested in manhood; instead it is concerned with solitude, punishment, and malaise for all individuals, irrespective of gender.  The movie explains the title, but I was still surprised that all the main events happened in the protagonist's adult years, yet this is called ""Old Boy.""

The main character's imprisonment in a strange building (that isn't a prison at all) twists his reality and mental state. Upon breaking out, he is bent on revenge - but again, he is being led on his path by that shady character from his past.
*SPOILER*
The film is exciting, at times funny and always intriguing, until its plot twists go one GIGANTIC step too far: the introduction of incest. This was so unnecessary and gratuitous that I literally turned the film off when it was revealed. When I came here to review this film, I saw that other reviewers commented that hollywood's Sexual Deviant In-Chief Quentin Tarantino loved this film.

2314894,5,B0009S2T0W,"A great Asian classic and one of the greatest Asian films ever and as a matter of fact, one of the greatest films of all time! On my list, it's right up there with some of my other favorite action-packed films like Almost Human (the 1970s Italian classic, not the 2013 film), Scarface, The Godfather Series, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, etc! This movie's so much of a classic to the point where it got an American remake in 2013, only 10 years after the original!

  The film's about a normal everyday business man named Oh Dae-Su (Min-sik Choi, ""I Saw The Devil"", ""Lucy"") who's one day, on his daughter's birthday, kidnapped by a man for the next 15 years. During the the 15 years, Oh Dae-Su's doing nothing but getting all riled up and trying to find a way to escape. He gets released and has only 5 days to get revenge and find out who kidnapped him and why. A girl named Mi-do takes him to her house and unlike other movies similar to this where a girl comes into the storyline, she's no distraction to Oh Dae-Su.

  The ending's quite a surprise and very shocking and of course, I'll not reveal it! Just to warn you, the ending took the shock-level EXTREMELY far just like how ""Sleepaway Camp"" did! This is a Korean film, meaning there are subtitles, but there'a an English dub which sounds extremely goofy! The DVD itself's not the greatest, but it comes with a slipcover, a ""Chapter Selection"" booklet, another booklet about other movies put onto DVD by Tartan who also released a DVD of one of my other favorite films ""Funny Games (1997)""!

I've never laughed so hard watching over two hours of the Video Diary because this cast liked to have fun between takes.  It's all English subtitled.  You get not one, not two, but three commentaries for the movie.  One deleted scene shows one of the greatest movie kisses, meant to be used in lieu of the sex scene when needed.  The deleted scenes and the featurettes are subtitled in English too.  The footage at Cannes when Oldboy was introduced to the world and won the Grand Prix prize is still thrilling.

The trailers and reviews made it seem like a dark and stylish revenge flick. It was very boring and convoluted. Not to mention the outcome is very disturbing in a gross way. I was hoping for an actual dark kind of drama/thriller but instead it turned almost comical at the end. I hated that the guy who should've been the hero of the movie was on his hands and knees literally barking like a dog. In a revenge flick? Not for me. I thought it started it off well but it just got really weird after he gets out and it only got weirder from there. I understand every story with this premise can't all be the same but this was way overboard and yet also underwhelming in terms of character and action. Not once was I scared of a bad guy or felt dirty when these terrible people were on screen. Not once.

The violence is also brutal but well done. Its one of those rare films that after you watch stays stuck in your head for awhile. Also, I saw this version much later after I had watched the American remake & even though it gets hate I liked both almost the same.

But one day,he was released unexpectedly. Unfortunately,events that happen outside lead to some unexplained events which still makes him trap in a web of conspiracy and violence. This makes him lead to a quest for revenge but it results into a bitter end particularly when he falls for an attractive sushi chef.

This is one great film that is characterized by surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion. The theme is about seeking revenge and how it destroys one person was definitely thought provoking especially for people who are used to seeing those actions become a successful in films. The characters are given emotional depth that one could sympathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. Finally,the cast did a great job and the soundtrack was mesmerizing. It is one film the one must see.",1404691200,2,1050,4.898876404494382

2315049,5,B0009S2T0W,"The revenge genre usually spawns very simple, straight-forward movies. Someone is wronged and seeks vengeance. A lot of time, the genre is just used as an excuse to convey bloody violence on the screen. The motive is present, therefore it can't be pointless brutality. Oldboy is the definitive revenge film, in that it transcends the sadism and becomes more like an existential look into how revenge takes over a person and how damage can never be undone no matter how much blood is shed. The multi-layered revenge story unfolds much like a film noir, in limited strokes that only cover certain aspects of the much larger story, leaving the rest up to the audiences imagination. The story we are told is one that is too ridiculous to be true, but it carries out in such a realistic way that gives it a kind of awe-inspiring quality. When insanity in the form of obsessive vengeance is shown in such a logical and methodical light, it's a natural reaction on the audiences side to have an uneasy understanding for the actions being shown. Although the story doesn't lack intellect, it is clear that the screenwriters were aiming for a more visceral form of storytelling that paid off in a huge way. If they're job was to make us feel the pain of those who have been wronged, mission accomplished. The substance of the film is dense and mysterious, but the talented cast and crew go out of their way to show off their talent. Most obviously is the director, Park Chan-wook. His visual style and attention to detail is almost other-wordly. The shot transitions, the gorgeous framing, the incredible corridor fight sequence, his overall control of the visuals, is outstanding. Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon obviously played a large part in Oldboy's style as well. The actors, primarily Choi Min-sik, Kang Hye-jung, and Yoo Ji-tae, the film's main three characters, are phenomenal. Choi Min-sik especially showed his dedication to the film by shifting his weight, eating a live octopus, and performing most of his own wild stunts. The soundtrack is another one of the film's praiseworthy aspects. Consisting of mostly noir-inspired classical compositions by Jo Yeong-wook, and one piece by Vivaldi, Oldboy's music adds greatly to the film's mysterious atmosphere and emotional resonance. All over the board, Oldboy is a contemporary masterpiece spawned from some of the most creative minds working in cinema today.",1402358400,,2412,5.0325

2315110,1,B0009S2T0W,"The film ""Oldboy"" itself is an absolute masterpiece, quite literally probably in my Top Ten favorite films of all time, of which I own over 4,000. I've purchased multiple editions of ""Oldboy"" over the years from Palisades Tartan, including the standalone DVD and BD's, the Ultimate Edition and also the Vengeance Trilogy Limited Tin Edition. The reason I'm giving this particular edition a review of only one star is that Palisades Tartan falsely advertised details of it's release. While this edition includes a good deal of extras that I'd highly recommend to anyone who's never bought the film before, they falsely advertised that it would include a lossless audio track, specifically a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Korean track, and sadly it only contains the lossy 2.0 Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital-EX 5.1 audio tracks from previous releases, and this is not the first time they've pulled this crap either. Considering how many different editions Palisades has released of ""Oldboy"", you'd think they'd for once deliver on their promises. Needless to say I'll be returning the copy I just bought, and hope they make good on their promises in the future. Considering the fact that Chan-Wook Park just recently screened a newly remastered 10th Anniversary Edition in theaters, I'm sure we'll see another double dip of ""Oldboy"" in the future, I just hope they get it right next (and for the first) time.",1388016000,6,1401,5.043103448275862

2315137,5,B0009S2T0W,"Watching this with the subtitles creates an extra layer of mystery and surreal distance.

To find out the truth about what happened and why it happened is sick enough, but to be left not knowing if he did the unthinkable or if he did the UNTHINKABLE. It was a lot to take in, for sure. I give the film 5 stars simply because the craftsmanship was undeniably high caliber in every aspect. But in America, films are in a mode of having rape scenes just to fulfill a sort of shock quota. This film goes to another level of depravity altogether.

The idea that Spike Lee is directing the new American version of this feels like it should be a rumor and not a fact. I can only assume he took it on out of sheer spite towards Quintin Tarantino (if you don't know, he has been very vocal about apposing Tarantino's representation of African-Americans and use of the N word excessively in his films). I expect Spike to ruin it; I can't imagine why else he would accept the gig, unless they let him change the ending to be less sadistic and twisted.

2315143,3,B0009S2T0W,"It's rather difficult to review this movie without revealing smoething significant about the plot. Here's the best I could do without containing spoilers:

Oldboy has good pacing great acting and excellent cinematography. Unfortunately these upsides only end up magnifying the great downside - Oldboy is a sick film. As the film unravels you get a good feel for the characters. Normally this is a major plus, but when something startling/disturbing happens it's twice as shocking because you've developed a rooting interest for the people involved. I'm all for suspense and shock value as much as the next person but I feel there should always be boundaries - trust me when I say Oldboy intentionally runs right over them. As engaging as the film is there are certain parts that ruin an otherwise great movie by trying too hard to be provocative.

I can honestly say it's impossible for a normal person to walk away without feeling seriously disturbed. Some may argue that's the entire point of the film. While I certainly agree, I counter with this question: At what cost? Should directors be allow to put anything and everything in a film for shock value? Are you willing to watch anything for suspense? Where is the line drawn? It's a slippery slope, and I feel this movie slide right off the cliff.",1379289600,3,1302,4.86036036036036
2315163,5,B0009S2T0W,"This is my favorite movie of all time. ""When I hear the music, that's when the gas comes out. The same Valium gas the Russian soldiers used against Chechen terrorists."" Actually, I believe it was Fentanyl vapor that the Russians used, but it's mysteries like this that add to the hauntingly poetic nature of this film. To fully submit to the hypnotic spell of Oldboy, it helps to know the story originated as Manga, a hybrid comic book/literary art form. (You can read the Manga Oldboy free online--just search for ""oldboy manga."" The Manga is a must for anyone who enjoyed the film.) We'll soon see how Spike Lee's new Oldboy holds up against the original.

This is one case where ""the movie is so much better than the book."" The plot of the film is much more intricate and compelling, yet it maintains a fantasy/dream feeling throughout, even as it rips out your teeth and shoves a knife into your back. There are holes in the way the story unfolds, and some scenes that may make little sense the first time around--like the flashback with the central character, Oh dae Su, as a youngster when he tells his friend what he saw through the schoolroom window that fateful day, which began the whole mess that left him--er, speechless. Or his deciphering of a code containing a biblical reference that enabled him to find his nemesis's home in a high tower. Oldboy contains numerous threads and some loose ends, and it's marvelous to watch them unravel. Oh dae Su is a tragic Manga superhero, more enthralling than Batman or any member of the rogues' gallery. ""Even though I'm a beast,"" asks Oh dae Su, ""don't I deserve to live?"" He's no beast, but can he exorcise his demons?

Through all its decades of tragedy and outrage, the story has moments of hilarity, like the 'dinging' of the bell when the dotted line is drawn from the claw hammer to the jailer's head. Few scenes can compare to seeing Oh dae Su emerge on a grass-covered rooftop in blinding daylight after 15 years in solitary ... or chasing down that one pot sticker with the unmistakable taste that he was forced to eat every day in his confinement. The film is a riddle that bears up well under multiple viewings. ""A grain of sand or a rock, they both sink."" Like Li Woo Jin's sister ... but oh what an unforgettable fall it is.

After watching Oldboy dubbed in English on a major video streaming service, I was surprised to find recently that the same service now offers a subtitled version only. Although I've never had a problem watching movies with subtitles, I recommend the dubbed version for English speakers over the subtitled version.

2315165,4,B0009S2T0W,"I have found that real life oftentimes is more bizarre than what the movies can deliver, sad but true, so who is to say this could not happen. What is good about this movie is the use of the camera at times. The scene where the antagonist is piecing together his memory of what may have led to his situation is well done. We watched the entire movie. It engaged us immediately and kept us interested despite some very uncomfortable scenes. A few twists in the story as well kept us interested. We watch a wide variety of things, including anime, so we are used to some of the extreme things in some Asian films.
 The stereotype of the trained fighter/martial arts guy with Right-on-his-side coupled with his anger and determination allowing him to take out a group of large men and leave them on the ground as he exits is perhaps used a few too many times. But hey, I sit through James Bond causing all women to swoon and that is just part of watching movies- suspending disbelief.
  There is much violence, sex, foul language and the story line and premise are a bit unbelievable. The sex and violence also serve the story line but still, it is uncomfortable.
 As an aside, I feel very sorry for South Korea because nowhere have I seen worse wall paper. Yeah, I know American movies don't show the grit of life as much as they should but the grit of South Korea in this movie means I will never put it on my ""want to visit"" list.

2315171,5,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy is definitely one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, but it is also one of the best. It has plot twists (although they aren't totally impossible to guess for astute viewers), weird and morbidly interesting characters, and scenes that are shocking and emotional... moreso than any other movie I have seen so far in my life.

The first thing to address is the disturbing part. It is a recurring theme in the 1-star ratings of this movie. Before you watch any movie, it's best to read the synopsis and some of the reviews that don't contain spoilers. Obviously, you should know some things about the movie (whether it has violence, gore, sexual scenes, drugs, scientific or psychological themes) before you even decide to watch it. If you can't handle blood or violence, this movie is not for you. If you can't handle sex scenes, this movie is not for you. If you can't handle disturbing subject matter, this movie is not for you. Basically, if you watch movies under a similar genre to psychological thrillers, it will most likely appeal to you. If it's your first time into psychological thrillers (especially Korean ones), there are milder ones you can watch first. People shouldn't be bashing a movie just because they feel uncomfortable with the themes in it. Lastly, I thought the ending was fairly straightforward though it seems some people think otherwise.

Another thing I admired about the movie was its characters. They stuck to their character throughout the movie. There was never a moment of uncharacteristic behavior. Oh Dae-su is supposed to be kind of dumb. That is obvious at the very beginning by the fact that he got drunk and acted like a moron on his daughter's birthday and subsequently, his actions adhere to his personality. It explains some of his more foolish decisions in the movie, such as who he trusts and his reasons for doing so. The villain is supposed to be hypocritical. It could be that he wants to blame and punish someone else for what happened to him. It's a pretty normal response for people when they don't want to admit they were wrong. His actions could also have something to do with losing face in a big way. It doesn't matter that what happened to him was a product of his conscious actions. Ultimately, it was someone else that caused him to lose face.

Finally, the scenes in this movie were amazing. This is one of the first movies I've seen that doesn't use martial arts or especially fancy fighting styles to make a fight scene. It uses raw power and endurance. Another cool thing about the fighting is that you can see everyone involved getting tired. It seems like a small detail, but when you think about it, most other movies don't accurately portray the limits to a normal person's endurance. The people fighting the protagonist in most fight scenes are either nobodies swept aside like nothing by the hero or the hero is shown with just a sheen of sweat on his body and a little heavy breathing... really? Oldboy's fight scenes are much more realistic. Another thing I found interesting about this movie was the consistent references to the time elapsed during Oh Dae-su's imprisonment. There are tons of things that pass people by if they are outside of society for 15 years. This movie is consistent about his ignorance to the world around him after he is released. But more than anything else, the dramatic scenes in this movie are strangely fascinating. He does crazy and unbelievable things that some people said were ""cheesy"" or ""soap opera like"", but I have to disagree. They are weird and kind of awkward sometimes, but also very disturbing and heart-wrenching. Seeing someone eat a live octopus, for example, is not ""soap opera like"".

2315178,5,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy is about the idea that love conquers vengeance. It takes both of these concepts to their Shakespearean extremes and leaves them to duke it out in a fist fight to see which comes on top. Love does. Thus, love conquers vengeance. Signed, sealed, proven. Q.E.D.

To hide the big twist of the movie, Oldboy starts out by pretending to be a revenge flick. The main revenge plot is that of Oh Daesu's quest to find the person who imprisoned him for 15 years and give him a piece of his mind. This revenge plot is supported by another revenge plot of Lee Woojin seeking revenge on Oh Daesu for having caused his sister's suicide.

The love plot is the relationship between Oh Daesu and Mido. Which develops over the course of the story. In the end, Lee Woojin reveals that Oh Daesu had caused his sister's suicide by spreading a rumor about her love with Lee Woojin, and that he had sought revenge by imprisoning Oh Daesu for 15 years and setting him up to fall in love with Mido, who is actually his own daughter. So Oh Daesu is faced with a choice. He can kill Lee Woojin and win his revenge. Or he can apologize and try to preserve his love with Mido. In no uncertain terms, he apologizes. Love wins.

The idea that love conquers vengeance is setup for a climactic clash clearly and dramatically. Then the idea is camouflaged with crazy high stakes, innovative directing and editing, a symphony orchestral sound track, and, of course, very graphic violence that actually supports the story.

Oldboy is an epic classic and it's a shame it is being remade in English.

I am not very familiar with Korean culture and movies.  No doubt they influence the style of acting etc.  The acting at times seemed very hammy - somewhat like the old mustache pulling villains in a silent movie but with sound and cursing.  At other times it was moving.  I hear Spike Lee will do a remake of this story for release in America in 2013 with Josh Brolin in the lead.  I will have to see it out of irresistable curiousity if nothing else.

While I enjoyed the film very much I don't think it lived up to the lofty expectations bestowed upon it.  The acting and directing are top notch and you do feel for the films main protagonist but the ending reveal fell a little short for me.  That being said Oldboy takes you on a an interesting and mysterious journey.  The film is really original and left me guessing until the end.  Some great shots and some of the fighting scenes were just brilliant.  I heard Spike Lee is doing an American remake and I will be interested in seeing that knowing that it probably will not live up to the original.

His prison is basically like a rundown apartment complete with bathroom, a bed and a TV as one of his only link to the outside world besides talking to the jailer, he gets fed 3 times a day including with water and would sometimes get a haircut but during those years he builds up so when the time comes he can take care of someone his own way. Now in 2003 after 15 years he is finally free out on the streets of Seoul as he is given new clothes, cash and a cellphone. He sees the city has changed over the years, he finds romance with a Japanese chef named Mido and now must find the crooks who tormented him and imprisoned him for those years.

A most excellent crime thriller and one of the best comic based movies ever. From Korean director Park Chanwook, this movie is loosely based on a popular Japanese manga or Japanese comic book, this movie is a poetic and very violent revenge movie about what it feels to be aged and being away from the world for a long time. There's a Taratino-esque quality to it that he even approve of this movie as being one of his favorite movies ever and now it has became a cult classic that even thrilled critics. This movie is brutally violent at times with a couple of torture scenes like the cringe inducing dental job with a hammer-back scene to good acting. This complex work of art is one that entertains and thrills the viewer to the edge of their seats to the mind blowing ending.

The blu-ray has a nice transfer with good sound with great extras like 3 commentaries in subtitles with your choice of Korean with english subs or English dubbing. Trailers, deleted scenes with optional commentary and a second disc with 5 documentaries, interviews and featurettes.

It has immersive dialogue and amazing fist fights. The dark story leads to a jaw-dropping conclusion filled with twists and turns; some may not be psychologically prepared for the epicly twisted ending. No other ending has affected me the way Oldboy's did. The music is amazing from beginning to end, and the acting was superb. Oldboy is a truly flawless film and a must-see for fans of film in general, not just fans of South Korean films.

Oldboy has vivid violence, strong sexual themes, nudity, a sex scene, and some language. I HIGHLY recommend it.",1340409600,,721,4.814516129032258

In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture.",1339459200,,1128,5.102702702702703

2315280,5,B0009S2T0W,"No spoilers here!  But you know that if Tarantino gave it his stamp of approval, then it's gotta be twisted!

I am a fan of Chan Wook Park's films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-a-Cyborg-but-That-s-OK/dp/B005B0ZF3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sympathy-for-Mr-Vengeance/dp/B000BGH2A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Vengeance/dp/B000GBEWNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Vengeance</a>).  I have yet to see others, but with just these four I am happy as pie!

Like his other films, the attention to detail is astonishing.  The camerawork, the angles, the shots, the cuts, the pans, the dialogue... everything is so well placed that we the viewer feel like we are in a 'motion picture novel' of sorts.

Starting out we get the sense of a Kafka-esque imprisonment story.  But things quickly become stranger with each passing minute.  Things seem to be more normal once our protagonist leaves his 'prison' but we find that he is merely trapped in a different kind of prison without walls.

There is a lot of violence, but it's not overly bloody or gory, which is nice.  It's one of the things I like about Park's films.  We see in one scene, for instance, a hammer poised over a man's tooth (close up), then the tooth starts being pulled and we see some blood trickling out, then the camera changes to the wielder of the hammer and he pulls his arm down and we hear, not see, the resulting tooth-ectomy, then we see a bloody tooth being dropped on a computer keyboard.  But we never see the tooth being ripped out since it cuts away.  Still, I feel that this only heightens the sense of horror and gritty drama.  It keeps the film from being a 'gore-fest' and keeps it rooted in the true sense of Art House film.

I thought Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance was a better film, though it was much more straightforward and less complex.  In this film we really have a sense of mystery that we focus on, rather than focusing on the actual motive for revenge and the emotions of the characters solely.  In the end, revenge is the theme, and it follows the grouping of his other films in his 'Revenge Trilogy' if you will.

This is an excellent film and I highly recommend it, just keep an open mind and be prepared to be shocked!  A well directed, wonderfully acted, and beautifully told story of horrific proportions.",1332288000,2,2563,5.410579345088161
2315281,5,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy is considered the second movie in the ""revenge trilogy"", and is also generally considered to be the best film in it. I would have to agree. This movie explores the psychology of revenge on a level I have never seen in a film before. The acting is far above what I expected and the story twists and turns in ways that even the performers at cirque du soleil cannot. If you want to test your boundaries of revenge, and have any interest in the human mind then this movie is for you. It strips you bere down to your heart and then beats on it with two fists. When they put Tartan Asia Extreme at the top they aren't kidding. This is the mental equivelent to raw violence of I Saw the Devil. If you want a movie that will make you think, you can't regret buying this film.",1330214400,3,775,4.173333333333333
2315282,5,B0009S2T0W,"Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is a tale of revenge. But to simplify the movie in one word would be to do it injustice. Raising questions right from the opening sequence till the very last frame as the credits begin to roll, the story is as engaging as it is thought-provoking. The characters are resolved wonderfully, especially Min-sik Choi's 'Oh Dae-su'. The cinematography and soundtrack lend to the drama, often becoming characters by themselves.

The Tartan Asia Extreme Edition Blu-ray is the best way to see the film as of today. Video quality boasts of excellent preservation of grain structure and some impressive black levels. Close-ups reveal a lot of detail like wrinkles, pores and cloth textures. It easily one-ups any previous editions of the film as one can now appreciate the already stunning cinematography on a completely new level.

Audio is presented in the form of a DTS 7.1 HD Master Korean track along with a couple of lossy options for the native language. There are two lossy English tracks on the disc, but the movie is best seen in its native language for maximum impact of the acting. I saw the movie in the lossless audio format, and the experience was terrific. The soundtrack is clearer than ever, there is much more ambiance than one might have expected and the dialogue is crisp. Gore-lovers will appreciate the audio detail in sounds that compliment the visual cues of torture and violence. Of course, it might also turn out to be a bit too much for the squeamish.

Anyone who appreciates this movie deserves to treat him/herself with this edition. If you haven't seen the movie yet, get this disc anyway. Just be prepared for a ride you might never forget.",1328140800,2,1688,4.833910034602076

Sound quality is however better and worth the upgrade. Extras are good but in standard def.

Yet this whole psychological experiment is really one of revenge from something tragic that happened back in his high school days.

Weirdly loopy logic throughout. Incredibly dark sets. Gratuitous nudity. Hilarious English dubbing. It works on a B movie level but to think this is great ""art"" is taking it a bit far. It's basically a typical story found in Japanese manga that J-salarymen get off on (high school sex and suicide) redone in a South Korean setting.

They make a movie how they envision it and if you don't like it... then don't watch it. This is one of those movies that just doesnt stop shocking you. The story is presented in such a way that you are just as confused as the main character and are on edge trying to figure out what is next.

All the genre hallmarks are in place, but this is much more than Kill Bill Korea or a Seoul version of a Charles Bronson blast fest, believe it or not, there's some real heart at work here.  Director Park Chan-wook takes obvious western influences and crafts a completely unique odyssey of death and even redemption.  Choi Min-sik is a miracle worker in his portrayal of the avenging angel Oh Dae-su.  His performance is probably one of the best to come out of any film in the last 20 or 30 years.

The serpentine manga story of Oldboy is judiciously revealing and though oweing nods to Tarantino, de Palma and even Robert Towne, as I said before, it feels original at every turn.  The action is similar. The hallway hammer fight is a brilliant example of where western action seems to always get it wrong.  Clearly Asian in style, Park's uncutting wide angle camera gives us everything without bumpy cameras and non-stop edits to break the dance of carnage or the tension.  There are no cheats here, we get it all in mass quantity.  And that goes for everything else in the film, like it or not.  Oldboy is a poster child for the eruption of excellent South Korean films in the last ten years and the pinnacle of the masochistic gangster genre that has become so popular on the south end of the peninsula.  Oldboy is an incredibly violent film.  It's not really Goodfellas violent, it's more Peckinpah or Marathon Man to me.  Yet for all the torture and brutality, Park Chan-wook  has a made a film that feels as violent as it needs to be to tell its story.  This one is not for the kids and also not very everybody.  It is a genuinely adult odyssey, and even then perhaps only for a few.

I feel there is a real kinship between Oldboy and Beat Takeshi's Violent Cop. But this one has real depth of story and character where Violent Cop was exercise.  The journey we go on is a long one and though the ending is needlessly ""artsy"" it is a satisfying trip and easily the finest, deepest and most polished of Park's vengeance trilogy.  I'm sure some greedy American producers are working on a remake but let's hope it never sees the light of day.  Even in South Korea many psuedo clones and even competent riffs like The Man from Nowhere miss the point.  Sight unseen, if a true remake ever comes, I'll skip the new one and take the old boy every time.",1312070400,,2606,4.412997903563942

the Old Boy name. If you want a story that is cheap thrills, shock and awe,
stupid plot twists, one dimensional characters and pseudo artistic style

2315317,5,B0009S2T0W,"This is the sort of film that reminds me why I love Korean cinema so much. I had meant to see it for years and am so glad I saved it up. This is the fascinating story of Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) who gets abducted one night after a drinking binge and is locked up in a sort of private prison for fifteen years. During that time no-one will speak to him, tell him what he has supposedly done or how long he must remain confined. It is based on a Japanese Mange written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. It is the second part of the trilogy preceding Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - and they are excellent too.

He is finally released and given a mobile phone and some serious cash. He sets out for vengeance on those that had wronged him and on his travels he meets and falls for a young and attractive sushi chef who he moves in with right away. He soon finds he is being watched and followed but the years of being locked up have made him resilient and fit as he had little else to do whilst being alone, other than build himself up. I do not want to spoil the plot but the more he finds out the more complex his situation becomes, with violent consequences.

The acting is superb, no-one is a passenger and director Park Chan-Wook does a brilliant job. This is violent, visceral and yet stylish. It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film and it is nearly two hours long, so that is some achievement. It is full of great lines that are heavy with poignancy, like - ""whether a rock or a grain of sand; in water they both sink alike. And that is the whole point of this film; we are all equal when faced with the unspeakable truth of our own depravity. This is a must see for anyone even slightly interested in Asian/World cinema, I strongly suggest watching them all in order as you will get so much more from the experience . It is an 18 certificate and contains violent scenes and adult themes, but it will stay with as a stunning piece of cinema.",1306800000,,2007,4.196891191709844

What I can tell you, however, is that I was completely speechless for about 20 minutes after the final credit rolled off the TV screen. Usually, I hit the stop button even before the first credit comes up when I am done with a movie but... oh no.. not this movie. I was so enervated by the sheer choking death grip of this unapologetic cinema that I couldn't careless about turning off the TV or DVD. I just sat there... dumbfounded.. totally, utterly disturbed and entertained at the same time.

I am sure my mouth was open for the entire time and no sound came out other than occasional f** and s** and several crude English vocabularies deemed unfit for public use by the FCC.

Those of you who have seen it... will agree with me, or at least understand what I mean when I saw the final twist that shook Daesoo Oh to his core and sent him to unmerciful eternal damnation fit for a page out of Dante's Inferno, I unknowingly stood up and yelled at the top of my lungs at the TV screen cussing up a storm. It was a scream for personal salvation as much as highest praise I can bestow on actors and the director of Oldboy.

What did I just see? Can I unsee it? If I close my eyes and pretend that I didn't just see what I saw.. will it go away? Then... a sudden realization hits me... my gosh.. as sick and twisted as it is... this is cinema at its best.

Watch this for cinematic beauty, gripping story telling, flawless or incredibly flawed personalities acted out by gifted actors. Most of all, watch this film because this is a movie Hollywood can only wish it can make.",1305763200,,1785,4.269230769230769

If you're lucky enough to be free from any spoilers as I was: Old Boy is completely original (how many times can you honestly say that about a film?), independently creative, performed meticulously and is deliciously twisted.

Top marks in every category that I can think of - and well worth the full purchase price. Don't even blink if a clean used copy is available - buy it.

Visually this film is very stunning. Each shot is very well composed and the actors all present their characters in a very convincing manner.

I will say as native speaker of the Korean language that the subtitles are not correct in all of the scene. It appears as if the company that did the subtitling may have attempted to censor some of the language and actual intent of some of the scene.

The most important thing about this movie is that it pushes Korean cinema into a new direction. Most Korean films over the past decades and even into the 21st century have followed a traditional pattern.  They have been very dominated by Korean society and the expectation of the Korean audience. This film steps outside of the established tradition and has moved Korean filmmaking into the next generation.",1300147200,,1080,4.546391752577319
2315335,4,B0009S2T0W,"Loosely based on a Japanese Manga of the same name, Old Boy is the second film in Park Chan Wook's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and the recipient of the coveted Grand Prix award from the Cannes film festival.

The story focuses on a middle-aged wage slave called Oh-Dae-Su who gets detained at the police station after a night of drinking and bad behavior on the night of his daughter's birthday. His best friend bails him out and when he turns his back for a moment, Oh-Dae-Su vanishes without a trace on the rainy streets.

Oh-Dae-Su spends the next 15 years mysteriously imprisoned in an apartment. A small television set and 3 square meals of Gyoza a day are all the luxuries he is afforded. He experiences important events and watches the outside world change only through his television set.

He shadow-boxes and trains every day in the hopes that one day he can exact bloody revenge on his mysterious captor. He scars and inserts wire filaments in the flesh of his arms to mark the years that pass him by. He imagines fire ants crawling all over his body and under his skin. He attempts suicide. Several times. His bewilderment turns to rage, his rage turns to grief and his grief gives way to gradual acceptance. But his thirst for vengeance remains unsatiated.

Then one day, after 15 years of imprisonment, he is knocked out by gas emitted into his room and he awakens instead in a briefcase on the roof of a building. Oh-Dae-Su sees the sun and breathes in fresh air for the first time in 15 years.

The world has passed him by; his wife was murdered years ago and his daughter was subsequently adopted by foreigners and migrated to Europe. Thus begins Oh-Dae-Su's odyssey of vengeance to uncover the identity of his captor and unravel the mystery behind his abduction.

Old Boy is a film that pushes the envelope, not in terms of violence (violence is not used excessively in the film but always in the most potent and effective manner when employed) but rather in terms of the themes the film explores; loss, vengeance, guilt, hatred, isolation, love and even incest.

Park Chan Wook has crafted a thought-provoking, unsettling and at times touching movie, one that actually transcends its source material.",1298851200,,2210,4.739583333333333

It tells the story of a drunken man who is all of a sudden kidnapped for no reason he can imagine and is held captive for a very long time, on a Monte Cristo timescale. The movie is very brutal and full of dark humour. The begining scene where our hero is a drunken nuisance is the most believable and amusing drunk I have seen in a movie and I should know, since I am a police officer myself. Then there are scenes where he confronts a man who is about to commit suicide by jumping off a tall building and a brutal fight where he takes on a large group of criminals. All are well thought out and realistic. All of this goes on while the main plot unfolds, why was he held captive, for what reason and by who. And those aren't even the right questions. There are bigger surprises in store.

To fully appreciate the movie you will need a dark sense of humour and a desire for mystery. But should you fulfill this criteria - Oldboy will leave you mightly pleased.",1286323200,,1199,4.254385964912281
2315342,4,B0009S2T0W,"I watch sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and learned about Oldboy. I really like Sympathy and thought I'd check this film out. All I ever heard were positive remarks about the film all of which I disregarded. As soon as I start checking out reviews and hearing the majority talking about the same thing I know I'm getting jipped. One person says they like this and another says the same thing and another then another and soon no one has an opinion of their own because they do want to say something different. They just end up jumping on the same horse that the last man got off of.

 When I checked up on this film I kept hearing about how Quintin Tarantino loved it. That right there was my first sign that I'd hate it. I hate Quintin Tarantino's films and I don't think these anyone out there than can be as successful as him when it comes to making the same movie over and over again and being praised for it. All of his movies have the same vibe, heavy language, goofy story and oddball characters, pretentious philosophies, and of course the cameo where Quintin polishes his own knob. It's this mixture that always made me dislike his films. It's like his movies just don't take themselves seriously no matter what it's about.

Understanding that Quintin Tortito loved this film I knew I was in for a film I probably wouldn't like. So I sat down and decided to give the film an open minded shot. It took me some time to really get into the film. I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped when our hero started masturbating himself. Already the style reminded me of a Tarintino film and I shut it off and shelved it. Only after hearing the movie pop up again some time later I decided to give it another try. What I found was a movie that progressed from ""quirky"" to dark to serious to dark to serious to ""light comedy"" to serious and then it ended. The film was able to make up it mind and settled on the fact that this film is an actual drama. This isn't a Tarintino film! This film knows what it wants to be and thank goodness!

 Oldboy deserves all the praise it gets for making you laugh but cry knowing that the main character only smiles because he really wants to cry. He starts out as raving drunk,then becomes hostile,then becomes vengeful, then he becomes merciless and pathetic. You don't realize until the end that the man character is as vulnerable as anyone else. That was the real twist of this movie. It's not about a revenge seeker that ends with him standing over his enemies in triumph. It's about a hollow victory and never being able to achieve that satisfaction.

With spoiling any of the movie it's hard to talk about any of the scenes or the amazing character development. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time where I couldn't guess what was going to happen next AND I KNEW WHAT THE TABOO SECRET WAS! and I still was caught off guard. I'm very glad that I did stick around to complete watching this film because it is a great movie that deserves all credit given to it.

So from Sweden to South Korea I went this weekend, and my friend was right, Old Boy was quite good. (But I think that I've filled my quota for subtitled movies for the year.)

While a little over the top and bizarre at times, Old Boy is one of the more original and diabolical stories that I've seen in a while. Your name is Dae-su and you've been kidnapped off the streets one day to find yourself locked in a room with no explanation for why you're being held captive. No one communicates with you other than a TV set that has been placed in the room and your only contact with anyone is a daily serving of dumplings pushed through a small opening in the locked door. Now imagine that several years of this pass and there's still no explanation for your captivity.

Would you go nuts? Or would you spend every day wishing and preparing for release so that you could exact revenge on your captors? Be careful what you wish for, because being locked in a room for the rest of your life could turn out to be a better option if your captor releases you and your imprisonment was only the beginning of your torment. ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone."" Baloney! Ask Dae-su how he feels about that inspirational poster.

Old Boy is darkly amusing at times, but mostly genuinely disturbing. Importantly, it was thoroughly entertaining. It had enough action and the twists and turns came frequently enough to prevent any boredom. Definitely worth reading 2 hours of subtitles.",1284854400,,1853,4.9326923076923075

2315367,5,B0009S2T0W,"`Oldeuboi' tells the twisted tale of a man named Dae-su Oh who is imprisoned for fifteen years with no understanding as to why only to be released suddenly, left to ponder the realities of his situation while seeking unlawful revenge on the man who stole such a large chunk of his life from him.

I don't even want to begin to hint at the films final revelations, for they are best served as a complete surprise.

Oh, but how delicious is heated debate, so I'm going to do my best to elaborate as ambiguously as possible here.

The film is a total morality tale, but it is, in the end, something completely devoid of all morals.  The character of Dae-su Oh is a drunk and a disorderly man (as witnessed by the opening scene as well as by news reports overheard shortly thereafter).  He has left a long trail of enemies (he himself finds it most difficult to narrow down the list of suspects in his search for his captor) and has cataloged a long list of personal failings on his part.  He is, as he put it himself, nothing more than a beast.  The thing is, when all is said and done, Dae-su Oh seems very human to the audience.  When you take someone who is reportedly undesirable and then do awful things to them they become somewhat sympathetic, don't they?  If you doubt my words then ask yourself why you don't hate him when the credits begin to roll, because you know why he did what he did and it should repulse you.  Another thing I find simply remarkable is the `reason' for which all of these things take place is not anything that Dae-su Oh even recalls.  As his aggressor puts it, it wasn't important to him and so he simply forgot; end of discussion.  The fact that it wasn't of any importance to Dae-su Oh is something of grave importance for it outlines the very fact that our actions, no matter how innocent in texture, have lasting and at times devastating outcomes.

But then again, it's not like Dae-su Oh is completely to blame for that tragedy.

If you are reading this and have as of yet to see this remarkable film, watch it tonight.

The film could be (ignorantly) labeled an action film.  Well, it is one to a certain extent, but Chan-wook Park really proves that there is no bounds to the amount of emotional depth one can heap upon a certain genre.  Not many action films contain this much poignancy and remain this harrowing.  The action scenes (which can get ridiculously brutal) are perfectly balanced in tone to never once convey a sense of surrealism.  This film is very real.  The violence is handled with care to remain something feasible.  The film never dips into CGI mode (thank the heavens).  The acting is also a standout.  The lead performance, delivered by Min-sik Choi, is so layered it is unforgettable (especially that breakdown sequence with the whole `dog' transformation).  Yes, he is angry and vengeful, but he is never one-note.  The amount of emotional transference noted in a single facial expression is bountiful.

The final reveal in `Oldeuboi' is heart stopping and it may leave a sour taste in your mouth, but it is all par for the course and serves as an unforgettable way to make a lasting impression, and raise very complex question:

""And now... now, what joy will I have left to live for?""",1278979200,,3248,4.526586620926244
2315368,5,B0009S2T0W,"A movie driven by madness is the shortest and best way I can sum up this film as it seems to be a plot focusing around which man can be the most insane; the one seeking revenge against his captor or the one who has done the capturing. I will need to be careful as the way the film's structured, in order to really tell anything of the story, I may have to spoil a few important moments of the movie so you have been warned.

The story focuses around a man known as Dea-Su who, at the start of the film is seen drunk, being held at a police station waiting for his friend to pick him up and take him home. Suddenly Dae-Su goes missing and wakes up a few days later locked in a room with no knowledge or where he is or why he's there. He is locked in captivity for 15 years and is released without warning. Driven mad by his own solitary confinement, upon release he immediately sets upon a mission to find his captor and discover the reason for his imprisonment.

While out he encounters a young girl named Mi-do, a sushi chef who takes pity on him and brings him into her home as he has nowhere else to go. Dae-Su, discovers that his captor is an old school friend by the name Lee Woo-Jin and the reason behind the imprisonment is that Dae-Su never kept his mouth shut and spread a rumour that destroyed Woo-Jin's family. Driven by the passion for revenge against Dae-Su, he looks to destroy Dae-Su in the same way that the rumours destroyed him.

The film itself takes on a comic book style of storytelling, darting from one scene to the next whilst consistently narrating the story to explain exactly what's going on. The character of Dae-Su is a fairly complicated one, but turns into a sort of anti-hero movie as he moves from one depraved and sadistic act to the next in order to find the answer to the question of why. Park Chan-wook does a splendid job of directing this and it's something you can really get into, once you have become used to following the subtitles and the on-screen action simultaneously.

The acting is superb, especially that of Choi Min-Sik (Dae-Su) as he portrays a man driven mad by his captivity and his own passion for revenge superbly. The main antagonist, Lee Woo-Jin, played by Yu Ji-Tae is played so well, the character itself is as disturbing as I'm sure he was intended to appear. Almost too cool and calm to be the villain of the piece, I found myself expecting something more behind the whole scheme as he certainly did not initially appear to be the man who would be behind this torture of Dae-Su.

Overall, this is simply a masterpiece of Asian Cinema and it is unfortunate, in a way, that the only real way we would get movies this masterful in the west, is if they were independent films that would ultimately not get the exposure they would deserve because the premise and outcome of the film aren't commercial. The worst news possible, relating to this film, is that there was a planned American remake and would undoubtedly poison the brilliance of this absolute masterpiece by putting a pointlessly optimistic spin on the story. Thankfully, it doesn't look like this will be happening, so I would strongly recommend this for the purposes of witnessing brilliant storytelling very rarely seen.",1274832000,2,3242,4.506802721088436

There is graphic violence and a fairly gruesome scene where the main character cuts off his own tongue. That little detail doesn't give away anything in the main plot, but it should provide our gentle viewers with fair and sufficient warning. Take the R rating seriously. This movie is not for kids or teenagers. It's for mature adults who occasionally like to explore cinema's darker realm. The ending has a clever, but disturbing, twist.

You'll know exactly what has happened and why. The English dubbing is well done. You don't need to read subtitles.

Personally, I do not want to see this again and would not recommend it to friends.  However, I can't deny the brilliance of the plot.  It's a movie about revenge and revenge it shows in the most gruesome way and definitely in an unforgettable way (although, I would like to forget some of the scenes).  The filmmaker has chosen the most personal, psychotic motive possible and the most disturbing and haunting revenge ever seen on film.  The mystery thriller element is also quite brilliantly done.  The movie definitely will provoke you to the extreme.  I can't bring myself to recommend it but I will say that on the theme of revenge there is no other film like it.

However it is mine and this movie is outstanding.  I'm going to try to do this without spoilers.  If I notice any I'll put some warnings in there.  The story is about a man who is kidnapped on his daughter's 3rd birthday and is held captive for 15 years in what appears to be a small studio apartment.  He is never permitted to leave this one room and his only connection with the outside world is a small telivision set.  He is fed the same meal 3 times a day every day.  One day he is drugged and unconscious and wakes up on the roof of a building.  This is where he sets off to find out what happened to him and why.

It all builds and builds and builds to an intense confrontation at the end that has the most shocking, jaw dropping, can't believe what I was seeing/hearing twist endings I have ever seen.  I literally gasped for breath covered my mouth and had to remind myself to both breath and blink again.

Yes throughout the plot there are some pretty silly scenarios like the main character surviving several injuries that in the real world would kill a person without prompt medical attention, or him beating back a whole hoard of armed gangsters with nothing more than a hammer (AWESOME SCENE THOUGH).  The good far outweighs the slight missteps.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodgiguez or any other violent revenge films.  If you don't think you can stomach the violence or subject matter then by all means skip it.  You're missing out though.",1260921600,2,1770,4.419753086419753

2315406,1,B0009S2T0W,"I had heard about Oldboy before.  IMDB has a very high rating for it, as does RottenTomatoes.  It's got revenge.  It's got violence.  It received a thumbs-up from Quentin Tarantino.  Everything seemed to be pointing in a positive direction for Oldboy ... until I actually saw it.  This was one of those rare movies that started out at 5 stars - I really liked the premise of the 15 year imprisonment and subsequent release - but then everything derailed about 20 minutes into the movie.  It's a repulsive film, about repulsive topics, populated by repulsive characters.  There's just not much to like.  Here's a quick tip for budding omniscient billionaires who are out for revenge:  If your evil plot is so convoluted and so drawn-out that the person you're targeting has to be hypnotized into REMEMBERING WHAT THEY DID TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE, then maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board.

** SPOILERS BELOW **

On one side of the equation you have Omniscient Billionaire who:

- murdered wife
- framed husband for that murder
- imprisoned husband for 15 years
- used Evil Hypnotist (tm) to re-program father and daughter
- forced father and daughter into having sex

On the other side you have:

- guy who started a rumor that brother and sister were having sex.  Which wasn't so much a rumor as it was the truth.

I'm not sure what lesson Oldboy is trying to teach us, but it was lost on me.  There were just so many stupid parts to this movie.  My personal favorite is when Oldboy leaves Mi-do in the care of a gangster that had his hand chopped off by Omniscient Billionaire.  In the culminating 'This is why I've been torturing you for 15 years' scene, Mr. Billionaire smugly tells us, ""Did you really think (gangster) would betray me?  You stupid fool!  I gave him an apartment so he would let me cut off his hand!  Bwa-ha-ha-ha!!""

Yeah.  Right.  Like anyone in their right mind would see that coming.  I will give the movie this, however.  It's not the type of film that you will watch and then forget.  Sadly, some of those scenes will be burned into my brain for quite some time.  Thanks a lot, Oldboy.",1258502400,27,2125,4.515789473684211
2315407,3,B0009S2T0W,"15 years' imprisonment, followed by five days of vengeance. But there's a twist: Oh Dae-su has not escaped from prison, he was released. The reason is the film's mystery, and as he attempts to solve it, it becomes clearer that someone is one step ahead of him.

Something of a spoiler follows, so stop now if you want to avoid it. It's not easy for me to figure out why I felt this film was a letdown. A lot of it I think has to do with the resolution. The tragedy seems neither justified in light of the characters and their actions nor adequately prepared in view of the what's on screen leading up to it. For three-quarters of the film we have something the look (apart from rough dentistry) and pace of which might fit Jason Statham (and I don't mean that as an insult). Then the last 20 minutes are supposed to hit us with the force of Greek tragedy -- all engineered, moreover, by the bad guy, and implausibly so. On the whole it is unconvincing.

Not something I regret seeing, because it's different from what's made available at the multiplex. But it won't be going on any list of favorites either.",1257897600,6,1107,4.3951219512195125

2315410,5,B0009S2T0W,"Straight to the point:

I loved this movie. I recommend it to everyone. It has an English language track for the film and English subtitles for all the special features including director commentary.

People should not expect elaborate improbable martial arts scenes, choreographed gun fights, excessive gore, explosions, car chases, and an expected ending.

Do expect plot twists, character development, great visuals, brutality, violence, moral dilemmas, great acting, and psychological drama.

This is a violent revenge movie, but doesn't follow the main stream revenge movie plot.
The message of the movie is that revenge never satisfies anyone. This seems to be the message of all the few Asian revenge themed movies I've seen. So, don't watch it if you are not a fan of these type of Asian movies.

What made me want to see Oldboy:

I first bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sympathy-for-Mr-Vengeance/dp/B000BGH2A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</a>. I then discovered that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sympathy-for-Mr-Vengeance/dp/B000BGH2A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</a>&nbsp;was the first in vengeance trilogy movies by director Park Chanwook. With Oldboy being the second and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Vengeance/dp/B000GBEWNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Vengeance</a>&nbsp;being the third.

I loved Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. It was the first Asian drama movie I saw that wasn't about martial arts experts, renegade cops, rival gangs, crime drama, or not starring your typical action anti-hero that goes around crashing cars into helicopters. Like Oldboy, that movie had violence committed by real people in realistic ways.

In the preview trailer for Oldboy, I saw that it had more stylized violence, but not the over the top unrealistic fights or over kill gun fights of other Asian action movies.

I won't give away the movie, but I will tell you what about the Oldboy trailer made me watch it.

Basic plot as told by Oldboy trailer: A man is for apparently no reason, kidnapped, locked up for 15 years in isolation, and then released. The man then has 5 days to find out why this happened to him and who did it.

To me and most people Oldboy would seem like the movie is only about the locked up man's quest for revenge.

This might be considered a spoilers:

The truth is that the kidnapping, locking up for 15 years, and then releasing of seemingly normal man is actually part of another man's own masterminded revenge plot against the man seeking revenge on him.

Bad plot point in Oldboy:

Half way through the movie some viewers, like myself, after finding out why the 'bad guy' wants revenge on the 'good guy' he locked up, might figure out what the  villain's revenge on the hero is going be. But, knowing this didn't prepare me for how the true revenge was handled at the end.

DVD Extras:

All deleted scenes were great with great subtitled commentary from the director.
The director interview gave informative insight on the director's view on his movies.

The film's subtitled audio commentary from the film's director and cinematographer is very disappointing.
I could only tolerate watching about 20 minutes of the commentary.
The two mostly spoke about the lighting, camera work, locations, and the entire production side of the movie. They didn't speak at all about the creative side of the movie. They spoke very little about the acting. The director didn't give any insight on his message or the meaning behind the scenes being shown. For example, a scene has a man freaking out because he thinks he's covered in ants, they comment on what it took to film the scene. I stopped watching after 20 minutes of them talking about green lighting and film bleaching.",1250553600,2,3894,5.525252525252525
2315411,4,B0009S2T0W,"In OLDBOY director Chan Wook Park creates a tale of a decades long revenge that chews up everyone involved even the one seeking vengeance.  This Korean movie won numerous awards for its bitter view of humanity that demands harsh judgment on the eye for an eye theme.  OLDBOY follows a byzantine path that drops in and out of flashbacks and flashforwards as it recounts a bewildering plot that begins with a slighty chubby foul-mouthed drunk Oh Dae Su (Min Sik Choi) who winds up in a police station arrested for public intoxication. He is bailed out by a friend who takes him to a phone booth to talk to his wife.  At this point the plot takes on surreal turn as the drunk is kidnapped and imprisoned in a well-kept but barricaded hotel room for fifteen years. His captor, whose face remains unseen, ignores his request for the reason. Time passes slowly. Oh Dae Su learns from his television that his wife was murdered and the police believe him the culprit. His daughter was put up for adoption. He is unmercifully tormented until for no apparent reason he is released whereupon he seeks revenge.  The second half gradually shows how Oh Dae Su discovers the identity of his abductor who tells him that knowing WHO is responsible is much less important than finding out WHY.  The WHY is a multi-faceted prong of self-acknowledgment of guilt and expiation for sins past.  It is painful to watch events unfold. We do not want a hero protagonist to be less than the stern but upright heroes of most action films.  Oh Dae Su is deeply flawed, possibly in a Shakesperean sense that requires every Lear to be a mix of integrity and hubris.  The villain evokes some sympathy as we can almost hear him say from King Lear as Edmund: ""Now gods. Speak up for bastards."" He sins mightily but we see that his sins tear him up.  There are no heros only victims here.  The ending is deliberately vague as we wonder how and to what extent Oh Dae Su can handle the truth of his most shattering of revelations.  We can only guess at that and this is why OLDBOY emerges as a tormented but brilliant import from Korea.",1249689600,2,2099,4.526455026455026
2315412,4,B0009S2T0W,"To describe any part of this film would be to ruin it, so I will only say that it is not something that you see every day. This is not your average and straightforward tale of revenge. It is brutal, shocking and so twisted, that it would certainly turn some people off if they knew what they were getting in to.

I suppose what I can say is it revolves around a man, who without warning or explanation, is held prisoner for 12 years and just as suddenly-he is let go. From then he has 5 days to find out why this happened to him. That is all you need to know.

Visually, the film looks very cool. It is bold in color, sometimes grainy and always interesting. I found the subtitles easy to follow, which I was glad of as some films, it just goes by way too quickly. The plot was easy enough to follow, even though you really don't know much of what is going on. Only in those last tense minutes do you get the sense of what you are witnessing.

Though I liked this film very much, looking back, I have to say that the plot is almost too elaborate for the big reveal ending. I can't go into depth here since I don't wish to spoil anything, but after I finished viewing it, I just thought that it just seemed a bit over the top. Also, I have no idea why this is sometimes labeled as a horror film- it is not. It is very adult however, with plently of violence and sexual content. I found this to be more of a drama than anything, especially after the end. People will have varying opinions regarding this film, though if you have an open mind and like a great mystery, you may enjoy Oldboy.",1249516800,2,1587,4.1294498381877025

This being said, early on the film's protagonist is kidnapped and locked away in a room for reasons which are unknown to him.  Beyond being fed, cleaned, and treated medically, his captors completely refuse to communicate with him who they are or why he is being held (however, his ""cell"" does come furnished with a TV - his only means of receiving communication from the outside world!).

Generally this Korean-made suspense/thriller (with English subtitles) was received well by critics.  Part of the enjoyment unquestionably is the twists and turns of the plot throughout.  Overall, very fine acting and a plot that (near as I can tell) holds up; whether one truly buys the bizarre storyline may depend on the particular viewer.

I give it a thumbs up - it's definitely memorable, stylistic, and entertaining, though it seems to fall under the trend of thrillers world-wide that seem to be competing for ""one-ups-manship"" in the areas of extreme plot, violence, mutilation, and perversity.  I would give it around 7 out of a scale of ten.  I would add that it is one that seems worth a second viewing based on a lot of subtle plot details the viewer may not pick up on the first time around.

Let me get that out of the way to show my bias. I love Oldboy. I think it's brilliant, I think the story is fantastic, I think the cinematography is phenomenal, and the acting is amazing. I can go on, but alas, I've run out of adjectives.

This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to get just a piece of the puzzle throughout the movie until the shocking (and it is extremely shocking) ending. You will find the grand reveal disturbing. There is no way around that. Once you get past the initial shock though, you will find yourself asking new questions about true love. The action is great but, contrary to what some reviews you may read have said, shockingly restrained (at least in comparison to other Asian films along the same genres (J-Horror for example)). Most of the most brutal parts are psychological or implied (the root canal scene comes to mind). As for the controversial octopus scene, eating an octopus while still alive isn't completely unheard of in Japan. It's just a cultural difference really. If it's any consolation, Min-sik Choi (who plays the main character) is a devout Buddhist who said a prayer for the octopi before every take. If you enjoy action or appreciate cinematography, this film is a must buy simply based upon the hallway fight scene.

""Oldboy"" is such a film, and to deny the fact that it captures raw and brutal emotion within it would be a disservice.  Whether you love the movie or despise it, you cannot argue with the fact that it will at some point hit a nerve.

""Oldboy"" tells the tale of Oh Dae-su, who at first sight is just a drunken babbling mess who gives no one any ounce of respect, not even the cops who have arrested him for his drunken and disorderly conduct.  He sings, calls them hideous swear words and sees no wrongdoing on his part.  After he leaves the station, he is abducted by unknown captors.  He is imprisoned in a strange and isolated room... for 15 years.  For those 15 years, he nearly loses his mind and wonders what misdeeds of his past has brought him to this horror.  After 15 years, he is released without any explanation or answers.  Oh Dae-su vows that he will find the truth and get revenge on anyone responsible for his imprisonment.  In fact, the whole point is that the captor is planning on Oh finding out the truth, as that is the whole point of his game.  Blood will be shed and devastating revelations will make their presence felt.

""Oldboy"" is a film unlike any I have ever seen.  Rarely have I ever seen a movie so dark, brutal and unrelenting--and yet be so beautiful at the same time.  You really do feel emotionally invested.  This is not a simple shoot-em-up revenge thriller.  It is something beyond that.  It poses questions and investigates the darker side of being human.  Not once did I feel myself losing interest.  The movie is superbly directed and acted.  There is a phenomenal fight scene where it's done in one complete shot, and without it being loud or flashy.  I also have to add that this film has one of the best and most haunting music scores since ""Requiem for a Dream.""

Be warned, this isn't for everybody.  It is a dark movie and it does not let you off easy.  While it's not non-stop action and the movie focuses more on story and character, the violent scenes are really brutal.  You can watch it with an English dubbed track, but I encourage you to watch it with subtitles and see it in its original language.  Nowadays the English dubs do not do the films justice, as they change words and phrases around to make it seem more in sync with lip movement from the actors.  The Blu-Ray version of the film includes 2 disks.  There are some nice behind-the-scenes featurettes.

""Oldboy"" is a film that will leave its mark on you, no matter what your final judgment on the movie may be.  It takes ""revenge"" to a whole new and unexpected level and you'll have no idea where it's all leading to until the very end.  It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for something that's dark, intense, challenging and beautiful, give it a try.  You'll never look at revenge thrillers in the same way ever again.

This movie could easily be sliced and diced into three or four genres and be in the upper echelon of any of them.  In fact, even writing a review of this movie is a challenge.  Basic plot synopses will not give you a sense of how original and well made this movie is.  This is the rare gem; you can either watch it simply for enjoyment, or peel back the layers like an onion and study each one.

There are a few warnings however.  This film is not for the squeamish.  After lulling you in with some slow segments, the movie can turn very violent and gruesome in an instant.  The film also touches upon some controversial topics, so it is not for the judgmental or the easily offended.  An important aspect to remember when watching this movie is that many of the social norms of Korean culture, and Asian culture in general, are so different from our own that it may be hard for some people to understand why characters make the choices they do.  If you are open-minded and study the film carefully, there is a lot of depth and meaning in that too.

The movie really occurs in several unique sections that are tied together at the end.  The basic formula has been described as a ""revenge thriller"" but the story changes in such a way to make that category inadequate.

Dae-Su (Min-Sik Choi) is an unfortunate man who gets drunk and kidnapped.  He is held captive in a cheap motel room for a very long time, with no real understanding of who is holding him or why.  All attempts to escape or find out why he is there result in nothing.

The story then takes a turn as Dae su is released under mysterious circumstances.  He vows revenge against his captors.

Dae Su seems to have a loose grip on reality after years of captivity and we see him slip further into madness as he seeks his tormentors.  As we follow his search for his captors and his difficult integration back into society, small clues start to emerge about Dae Su's past and who might have been behind his imprisonment.  There is more than just one twist to the story, and each plot element adds a new layer.

He befriends a woman in a sushi bar and they develop a quick relationship.  As all the plot elements collide, we see that nobody in the story is exactly who we think they are.

The end results in a very thought-provoking dilemma which questions the fundamental nature of many of life's basic human relationships.  Love, hate, revenge; they are all put under the microscope in this movie.

The film is shot beautifully and has many beautiful scenes.  Colors and shadows are used to create and foreshadow emotion.

The DVD extras include standard fare, such as interviews, deleted scenes, trailers and a commentary track.

Conclusion

This movie is a must-see if you enjoy psychological horror, as long as you can set aside your squeamishness.  If you like psychological drama, horror, or thrillers this may be the best movie you've seen recently in any of those categories.  Watch it with an open mind and avoid plot spoilers.  Once you've seen it, you'll probably want to see it again.

""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""

After getting busted for being drunk and extremely disorderly, rumpled businessman Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) gets angrier and angrier as he sits at a station waiting for the police to release him because he has to go home--it's his little girl's birthday. Getting nowhere with the standard inebriated outbursts and tantrums, he tries to flip on the charm and show the police he's a nice guy (in a fantastic set of hysterical cut shots): a proud papa--shoving pictures of his daughter at the cops; an entertainer -- dancing and singing while wearing a small set of angel wings he bought as a birthday present for his little angel; and finally as a regular Joe--by flirting with a younger girl (who also happens to be sitting right next to her boyfriend). It's still a no-go with the cops however, until Dae-su's best friend, Joo-Hwan, comes to bail him out. While his friend apologizes profusely to the police, Oh Dae-su waits (quietly--to everyone's surprise I'm sure), until he does the regional equivalent of giving the cops the middle finger and scrambles from the station.

We find him in a phone booth calling his daughter to apologize for being late, and he suddenly puts his friend on the phone (looking to avoid a screaming wife who's bound to jump on any second--well maybe in Asia it's considered `concerned nagging') and steps out of the phone booth.

It becomes the biggest mistake of Dae-su's life.

THE BOTTOM LINE

Oldboy is a true rarity. While it's the second film that ever made me restart the DVD immediately after the final credits (Usual Suspects being the first), it's the first to make me do it four times in a row.(When it's that good, I tend to get ""a tad"" obsessive-compulsive.)

This three act thriller is a total descent into the power of human will, that while full of raging action is even more horrific than any giant deity flailing a chainsaw through ridiculous sequels or CGI boogeyman (or woman or child) because this is the ultimate psychological game, and for all of it's intricate details, Oldboy is actually plausible...with the right kind of connections and patience.

The screenplay is brilliant, with dialogue that's actually practical and informative---no weak red herrings or filler chat-chat here; the direction and cinematography are phenomenal, smooth and (here's another rare part) ultimately and intimately involving---Park brings the audience Dae-su's ordeal with moments of claustrophobia and even the relief of space (I actually caught myself inhaling deeply once he was released) that can't help but bring us right into his head, and naturally sympathize completely with his plans of revenge.

The extent of his captor's cruelty and the purity of Dae-su's determination for absolution are truly astounding. I also definitely recommend watching it in it's native language (Korean) with subtitles, even though it has the option of English audio; Choi's tone and passion put the final stamp of perfection on the entire film. If you aren't emotionally exhausted by Choi's magnificent performance, then check your pulse, cuz the man has got serious game.

Sir Anthony Hopkins. Robert De Niro. Al Pacino. Choi Min-sik.

Oh yeah people, he's easily sits among the greatest in the world.

Oldboy is an absolute masterpiece: psychologically brutal, darkly hilarious, beautifully presented and completely disturbing---results only possible by those who understand true human frailty and drive.

I became a fan of Choi Min-sik and Park Chan-wook after the first run--they totally broke my mind and I absolutely love them for it.",1213747200,3,3702,5.079077429983526

Some may be offended by its over-the-top violence but they can't really appreciate the film for what it is: a masterpiece.  Everything about this movie is exceptionally well done, and it is now being picked up by Spielberg who is remaking it with Will Smith to star.  If you don't like reading subtitles you can still enjoy this movie, because the english dub is one of the best I have ever heard.

2315501,1,B0009S2T0W,"The great composer Gustav Mahler reportedly once said, in reference to his contemporary Puccini, ""These days any idiot can orchestrate to perfection."" I happen to love Puccini, but I think I understand the point Mahler was trying to make, that an artist can be technically proficient, a master craftsman in fact, and still create art that is slick, soulless and pedantic. This idea applies as much to film as it does to music. To paraphrase Mahler, ""These days any idiot can edit to perfection."" He can cut, paste, slice and dice, pan and scan with the best of them, he can rearrange his narrative so that it becomes a complicated jigsaw that the viewer has to invest some mental effort in putting back together, but that doesn't necessarily make him a great director. Oldboy is proof positive. Now, I don't mean to suggest that Chan-Wook Park is an idiot, I just think he's the kind of artist Mahler was talking about, a master craftsman whose film is slick, soulless and pedantic.

Past masters such as Ingmar Bergman and Luis Bunuel made obligue, complex pictures as well, cinematic puzzles so to speak, the kind a viewer has to think about before he can reach understanding, but the puzzle isn't so much about what happens onscreen, it involves piecing together what the film is ABOUT. Take Bergman's Through A Glass Darkly for example. The narrative part of the film is linear and straightforward, any ten-year-old watching the film could tell you what happens, the sequence of events, but could he tell you what it all means? The beauty of Through A Glass Darkly is its ability to make the viewer grow while watching it, make him contemplate his own feelings about God, family, relationships, spirituality, madness and art, and in effect he has the opportunity of becoming a more thoughtful and self-aware person via the experience. Does anybody really think that the decadent-for-its-own-sake Oldboy could have that kind of an impact on its viewership? Park's film is all about confusing the audience in a far less meaningful way, making the viewer work to reconstruct its fractured storyline, which to me is a more shallow form of complexity. That might sound like an oxymoron but it certainly applies. I'm not denying there's a message to the film, that obsessing over vengeance can turn a civilized person into a beast, into his own worst enemy, but that concept alone is hardly new or earth-shattering considering that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet centuries ago. A film that wants to pass itself off as great art needs more than that to qualify as substantive, instead, Oldboy uses its thematic pretensions, as well as its edgy, hyperkinetic editing, its swallowing orchestral motifs, its off-putting violence and depravity, in short its self-conscious artiness to distract the viewer from its nonsensical plot.

Be warned, the following paragraph contains spoilers, but since the purpose of this review is to dissuade potential viewers, the spoilers don't really matter. The story of Oldboy is basically a comic book plot blown up to pseudo-artistic proportions. It involves an absurd villain who blames the death of his sister on a fellow student from their high school years, but instead of confronting the guy years later, maybe punching him out, or holding a gun to his head and saying, ""You ruined my life, you scumbag!,"" he comes up with an elaborate plan to carry out his vengeance that involves kidnapping the man, holding him prisoner in an apartment for fifteen years, hypnotizing him, murdering the man's wife and framing his victim for the crime, hypnotizing the man's daughter while financing a cover-up that leads the man to believe that the young woman is living in Switzerland, all this so that by the time the man escapes the daughter will be old enough, and unfamiliar, for him to unknowingly sleep with her!(Of course she also happens to be beautiful and sensual, a plain, sexless daughter would have very little use in the film, although I suppose the villain could have anonymously financed her plastic surgery, he manages to do everything else!) The reason for all this? While in high school, the man inadvertently started a rumor(which by the way is true) that the villain and his sister had sex. His crime was talking too much around the wrong people, as high school boys are won't to do. Anyone who thinks that the folks who appear on the Maury Show to confront bullies from their past need to get a life should take a serious look at this guy! He makes No Country For Old Men's Anton Chigurh seem like a subtle, realistic, and down-to-earth baddie by comparison. Of course our dastardly fiend has unlimited resources at his disposal, as all comic book villains do, he has wealth, a bodyguard, an army of thugs, access to hypnotists, hallucinatory gases, numerous penthouse apartments, revolutionary surveillance devices and other convenient technology, everything he needs to carry out his mad scheme, plus a heartlessness that allows him to exploit and maim and destroy(in some very gruesome sequences I might add, gruesome to the point of being almost unwatchable) until his vengeance is complete. All of this is presented in a style that is very garish and over-the-top, which is necessary, otherwise the viewer might think too much and recognize the preposterousness of it all. The prisoner becomes just as hungry for revenge, blurring the lines between good and evil but not in any way that is convincing, because Chan-Wook Park isn't interested in presenting us with a serious examination of violence and its causes, he's more interested in indulging his deranged imagination.

Modern film, television as well, has fallen in love with this in-your-face style of filmmaking, with circuitous storylines(here a twist, there a twist, everywhere a twist twist), graphic yet stylized gore, frenetic pacing and hallucinatory editing, but with little if any substance, and this is what passes for ""smart.""

2315504,4,B0009S2T0W,"""Oldboy"" is a fascinating mix of Western and Asian cinema, with equal bits Hitchcock, Kubrick and 21st century Asian horror.  On one level, ""Oldboy"" is a classic man-wrongly-accused story of the type Hitchcock did so well - but neither we nor Dae-Su know what he is accused of.  Indeed, ""Oldboy"" starts off as man-wrongly-punished - or is he?  Park sets up the camera and lets it remain stationary a la Kubrick for much of the movie, adding to the tension by making us unsure of when he will cut away.  And us Western viewers will wish he had cut away from some of the more gonzo horror scenes.  Asian horror is far more transgressive than American horror, and while this film does not descend to the same depths that a Takashi Miike film would, several scenes go beyond what we Americans are used to, even in a post-""Hostel"" world.  Even the subject matter, which is revealed at the end, is much more transgressive than what we would expect from an American movie.

Having said that, ""Oldboy"" has no shortage of humor, interesting characters, and artistic choices - shades of ""Pulp Fiction"" and Tarantino's other films.  As such, ""Oldboy"" may be one of the more accessible films to those new to Asian cinema.  And it includes a psychopathic Stanford grad, to boot.

I knocked off a star due to some pacing issues, and an ending that didn't quite fit with the rest of the film.  Without ruining the ending, it lasts too long, and where we should be racing for the curtain, there is overwrought melodrama and general wasting of time.  I thought this was over 10 minutes before it was.

Nevertheless, fans of suspense, action and horror will enjoy this, as will fans of Asian cinema and people who are interested in Asian cinema.  ""Oldboy"" is worth at least a rent.",1203465600,,1763,4.627009646302251

I loved this movie, it had all the elements to be a 5 star movie, great script, great acting, and lots of unexpected twists & turns that keep you guessing til the very end! However, (and maybe this is just me...) once I got to the end of the movie, (despite the fact that it left me in awe) I almost wished that I hadn't...
Oldboy, in essence, is pure genius. But the utterly revolting incestuous sex scenes took off a star for me. It may be unfair, because those scenes did have a point, and because they added to the overall shock value once Oh Dae Su found out that Mi-do (his lover) was actually his daughter and that his captor had orchestrated the whole thing, their meeting, their friendship, and them falling in love. It was pure brilliance...
So why did I take off a star? Because of Dae Su's decission to forget the awful truth about Mi-do, the woman that he loved so much, being his daughter through way of hypnosis. It was tragic, it was brilliant, but it's simply not the sort of thing I would've done if I were in his shoes...
The verdict? 4 out of 5 Stars. It was a great movie with a tragic yet brilliant ending. However, incest is just gross... And Dae Su's decission to forget the truth in order to stay with the woman he loved is what stopped me from giving it 5 Stars.",1199404800,2,1408,4.180147058823529

2315529,4,B0009S2T0W,"In America, movies are a commodity, driven by the almighty dollar.  Outside of the US, however, movies tend to be viewed with a more artistic mind.  This film is a perfect example of what happens when a director doesn't have to answer to a board of directors, and is allowed to follow his vision...and what a vision it is!

Oh Dae Su is a Korean businessman, who is mysteriously abducted after a drunken night on the town (and at the police station).  He awakens in a tiny apartment, completely alone.  His only human contact comes when he is unconscious, and the television is his only contact with the outside world.  On the 15th anniversary of his imprisonment he is released; given only a cell-phone, wallet, and 5 days to discover why he was abducted in the first place.

The core theme of this movie is revenge, but its so much more than that.  We are shown glimpses of one man's slide into madness (and brutality), an extremely tight mystery, a touch of romance, and (in it's own bizarre way) redemption.  Nothing is quite as it seems, in this film.

The acting, direction, and story-telling are top notch (M. Night Shamalan would do well to take notes from Park on the use of plot-twists).  The visuals are both brutal and beautiful.  Given the graphic nature of some scenes, this movie is most definitely not for everyone.

why the main charachter got imprisoned. This question is hammered
exuberantly upon us. If this is all the movie is about, is that
question at all interesting? Throughout the movie there are boring
meaningless unoriginal scenes of violence. And after all this
we are presented with an explanation why it all happened. I think at this point the makers of the movie wants us to think ""oh, i could never have guessed that... completely brilliant"". Well, there are myriads of endings
we would never have guessed. That doesnt make them interesting.
This is just an ad-hoc excuse for the prior scenes of violence.
""Now we have shoved meaningless scenes in your faces for one and a half hour, so we owe you an explanation.""
This is actally a very common model for making a poor movie for the masses: First leave the viewers in confusion for no reason. Then in the
end reveal everything so it becomes completely obvious. The ones who haven't already forseen the ending might be fooled that the movie is
very coherent and original. ""oh it was like that all along... wow... who would have guessed"". Really, it is incoherent because the first (and majority) part of the movie has
really nothing to do with anything... it is empty. To insert

2315555,5,B0009S2T0W,"OLDBOY is the 2nd installment of Park Chan-Wook's vengeance trilogy that is loosely based on the Japanese comic by Tsuchiya Garon and Minegishi Nobuaki. I use the term ""loosely"" because the plot, characters and almost everything else is completely re-worked for the big screen. I've read that Park saw his film; ""Sympathy with Mr. Vengeance"" a sort of commercial failure, so he comes back with an effective counter-attack. Oldboy made me re-think the old adage: revenge is best served cold, because this film emits SCORCHING FIRE.

Oh Daesu (Choi Min-Sik) is a man with a wife and child. He is kidnapped and kept in captivity in a small room, fed with dumplings mostly as his main dish, with only a television to keep him company for 15 years. Someone paid an obscene amount of money to incarcerate him indefinitely. Mentally tortured and overcome with a desire for revenge, he plots for escape. One day, he is set free and dumped in the streets, with a suit to wear and left with some money. Daesu meets and hooks up with a young sushi chef; Mido (Hye-Jeong Kang) to look for the man responsible for his incarceration.

""Oldboy"" has a lot of visual wallop and visceral punch. Park's stylish direction and the VERY intriguing premise are truly awesome. There are quite a few films that really stayed with me; this film is one of them. I can still clearly remember the great soundtrack, the visually original hallway fight, the tooth-pulling, the live octopus devouring and others. The ingenious style of its direction and the balanced intensity of its execution keep the proceedings grounded. The plot is a bit over-the-top but to the director's credit, it remains balanced and believable.

This film may be considered an ultra-violent dark film by most people but it is actually very tame when it comes to blood and gore. The proceedings are so well executed that the atmosphere emulates violence and darkness. The very set up and sequences of what happens in each shot creates a lot of tension that people will remember it as a very dark and violent film, that it is in fact gorier and bloodier than it actually is. Park has the hand of an artist and is a true visionary to be able to pull off this sensory manipulation. ""Oldboy"" has a lot of uncompromising twists and turns.  You will have to keep in mind that Park's films are usually a character study of its main characters.

Aside from Park's stellar direction and premise, the film draws its strength from its excellent cast. Choi Min-Sik gives a near-stellar performance as the main character. I remember his haircut that looks almost like a mangled lion with a chopped black mane. His portrayal of a BROKEN everyday man is one of the reasons why ""Oldboy"" has been elevated to ""cult status"". The film's final image; Choi's joyful but at the same time, infinitely sorrowful SMILE will forever be remembered by its audiences.  Ji-Tae Yu plays the villain; Woo-Jin, suave and handsome; with his Bond-like physical attributes and a very elegant charisma. Despite his good looks, Ji-Tae Yu has a very menacing presence and does command attention like a deity, with a ""mere"" mortal as his plaything.

One VERY minor (so minor) fault the film may have is that the method of which the actual revenge is executed. The hint of hypnotism may require a tiny suspension of disbelief. Everything plays out so well for the antagonist; we are all expected to believe that he is a genius, with an intellect dedicated to the torture and punishment of one man. He has dedicated 2 decades of his life to his vengeance which may be one of the coldest, if not, certainly the most perverse. However, this very minor flaw is forgivable, because the film is so focused and succeeds in immersing us in its sequences that all we consider are the things that it has done PERFECT.
Oldboy explores a moral issue about vengeance; what happens next after you do exact your revenge? If revenge becomes a main focus of your life, what else is there to live for? With Daesu and Lee Woo-Jin, the answer is very different.

OLDBOY is PURE contrasting cinematic genius; it is repulsively ugly but at the same time, it is breathtakingly beautiful. It is gut-wrenching but at the same time it is very delicate. It is cold but indeed emotional. It is mind-bending at times and certainly artistic in its execution. With its flair and style, it is a bunch of contradictions that adheres to coherency.
Park will not only entertain but make you uncomfortable. It does no other film has done: to entertain at the same time analyzes pure emotional pain. It is TERRIFIC!
Highest Possible Recommendation! [ 5- Stars]

2315613,5,B0009S2T0W,"Based on Garon Tsuchiya's manga, Oldboy is about Oh Dae-su, an ordinary salaryman type, who is held at a police station for being drunk.  Afterwards, he is kidnapped, locked up in a hotel-like room without windows, gassed repeatedly so the room is cleaned and so  he can get a haircut and clean clothes, and kept there for 15 years.  ""If they had told me then that it would be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure....or harder?""  His only contact to the outside world is the TV.  ""It's both a clock and a calendar. It's your school, your home, your church, your friend... and your lover

It's after being let out and into ""life in a bigger prison"" that Oh Dae-su's quest really begins.  Who imprisoned him and why?  He is given a cell-phone and a wallet full of money by a scraggly bum, then goes to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mido, a beautiful young woman who takes pity on him and takes him back to her place when he collapses.  It also appears he has been hypnotized during his imprisonment--but why?  His nemesis, a man later identified as Lee Woo-Jin, is quite the mastermind.  When they first confront each other, Lee gives him five days to find out the truth, or he will kill Mido.  If Oh Dae-su wins, Lee promises to kill himself.

Through clues of finding out which Chinese restaurant provided him with the same potstickers he ate for 15 years, he finds Mr. Park, the owner of the hotel where he was imprisoned.  It is here that two memorable scenes occur, one a tooth torture scene where he extracts Mr. Park's teeth out with a hammer, all set to Vivaldi's ""Winter"" section of the Four Seasons.  Using such music in such a scene adds a bit of humor in it.  He then takes on a handful of Park's thugs armed only with a hammer, his fists, and keeps on fighting even though a knife is plunged into his back.  The sardonic smile on his face when he encounters an elevator full of thugs is priceless.  Guess what happens to them?

The theme of revenge and Lee Woo-jin's attitude, ""Whether it is a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike"" implies that no sin is too small for revenge.  He later tells Oh Dae-su, ""Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt.  Try it. ... Once again, revenge is good for your health.""  But to quote Hamlet, aye, there's the rub.  ""But what happens after you've had your revenge?  I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again.""  The whole point is that this isn't about Oh Dae-Su's revenge on Lee Woo-Jin, but vice-versa.  As someone who holds grudges easily, I can easily relate to what Lee says.

Oh Dae-Su's introspection in seeing who it was he had offended reveals that every life is far from perfect.  ""Study your whole lifetime,"" he is told by Lee.  But he also realizes that his imprisonment has changed him, as he figures Mido wouldn't like him the way he was before imprisonment.  But there is hope for redemption, as seen in the scene with snow, symbolizing a clean new start.

This was actually the second film I'd seen with Choi Min-sik, the first being Shiri, but so far, this is his master performance, a creditable and credible performance as Oh Dae-Su.  He later appears as the villainous Mr. Baek in Lady Vengeance.  Yu Ji-Tae scores well as the devilish but weak Lee Woo-Jin, and has a cameo in LV.  Ditto for Kang Hye-jeong as the cute-as-a-button Mido.  She is a TV reporter in LV.  And Oh Dal-Su (Mr. Park) plays the bakery owner Mr. Chang in LV.

The movie's score is another triumph.  Whether it is the upbeat techno beat of the opening shot of Oh Dae-su grabbing onto the suicidal man's tie, the haunting quiet ambience during Oh's fight with Han in Lee Wu-Jin's penthouse, the Godfather-like waltz that is Lee Woo-Jin's theme, and Mido's sad theme with clarinet and strings, the music team scored a big triumph.

This is hailed as the best in Park Chan-Wook's trilogy in story-telling, film-making, acting, and techniques.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.",1180051200,5,3983,4.5083798882681565

Pretty much every other review and the film synopsis will tell you the plot so I don't need to rehash that but I will say that the acting was fantastic and the plot twist was unexpected and disturbing.

2315616,5,B0009S2T0W,"This film, in spite of its sulfuric reputation, and the direct connection established by the media in the recent Virginia Tech massacre case, is a masterpiece. A boy has been privately imprisoned for fifteen years with no explanation at all, and of course no trial. It was a private initiative taken by some kind of criminal organization controlled by some kind of mafia itself organized by the entrepreneurial rich. When he is freed he tries to find out why he had been imprisoned like that and to get even with those responsible for it, hence to get his vengeance. The film is a lot more powerful than that in fact, than a simple vengeance case. He will understand that he had known something he shouldn't have known, and he had used it against a schoolmate of his though he should have known he should have kept it for himself, he should have kept his trap shut. And his talking, even if very little, was enough to cause the suicide of a person, and it is the schoolmate of his and lover of the suicidee that went through with his own justice. The film becomes great when the victim of this imprisonment understand his mistake, his crime, his responsibility in the death of the other person and mutilates his speaking for him never to speak anymore. But then the schoolmate, quite older of course understand that he caused a lot of suffering, the death of his victim's wife for instance and the disappearance of his daughter. He then brings justice back onto himself. And the Old Boy, meaning the boy who got old in this private prison, can finally tell the story, in writ, to a woman friend of his and he finally rediscovers love, even if mute love. And this time the film becomes a rewriting of Oedipus' myth: the criminal, unaware of his crime, blinds himself when he discovers the amplitude of his criminal attitude and will die slowly in poverty, rejection and begging. Here the responsibility is definitely shared, silence is imposed onto the criminal tongue, but death comes to the avenging initial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story. Guilt is always a shared human dimension and punishment must also be shared though some innocent people will pay for the crimes of others and the initial criminal will have to pay more than the subsequent ones. The human species is a very barbaric animal race and yet it is haunted by justice.

2315617,5,B0009S2T0W,"Having seen all of Park Chan-Wook's Revenge Trilogy, I can honestly say that Oldboy is the best of the three.  I was luke-warm towards Mr. Vengeance, but I loved Lady Vengeance.  It seemed to take what was done in Mr. Vengeance and add so much more depth of plot and image to it.  But Oldboy stands alone.  It is a masterpiece.

Why?  First, you will rarely experience a movie so violent, and yet so full of true beauty.  The shots in this film are just phenomenal.  The movement, and the framing of each character, the motifs that recur and deal an emotional sting whenever they arrive, the graceful ballet of Oh Dae-su's battles, it is all magnificent.  Forget Tarantino; this film reaches to the heights of Welles, Fellini, Coppola, etc.  I am not kidding in the least.  It is that good.

This film is worth anything you pay for it, but the boxset is remarkable.  There are excellent documentaries taking you through the process of filming, as well as the first volume of the Oldboy comic (similar to Sin City's special edition...and this box won't fall apart on you).

Lady Vengeance was a brilliant follow-up to Oldboy, but I can only hope Park Chan-Wook is able to again reach the cinematic brilliance - the interplay between the cinematography, the movement of the camera, the absolutely superb acting and imagery, the saliency of the colors, etc. - that is Oldboy.

2315619,5,B0009S2T0W,"""Oldboy"" is an excellent film.  Its violence is startling.  Korea has two major film festivals, one is government-sponsored while the Blue Dragon festival has been controversial because it is sponsored by a conservative newspaper -- like the Fox news of Korea -- and has had scandals about vote buying.  Despite that controversy, from what I've read, it is highly influential in Korea.  This film won three major Blue Dragon creative awards.  Park Chan-Wook won as Best Director; Choi Min-Sik won as Best Actor; and Gang Hye-jeong (or Hye-jeong Kang) won as Best Actress.  The film also won the Grand Prix Award @ Cannes in 2004.

The story grabs you from the start.  We watched the DVD in Korean with English subtitles to hear the powerful original voices of the actors.  As Oh Dae-su, Choi Min-sik does a masterful leading performance.  His character goes from obnoxious drunk to the driven haggard man who seeks revenge.  Both he and Yu Ji-tae again work with director Park Chan-Wook on ""Lady Vengeance,"" with a similar theme, this time with a woman falsely imprisoned.  Yu Ji-tae as Lee Woo-Jin is a smooth corporate success.  The set designer creates a cold austere penthouse where Lee Woo-Jin showers in a glass stall in his office and has waterways built into the floor.  The subplot of his illicit relationship with his sister and his murder of her is chilling.  Gang Hye-jeong as Mi-do does a good job of being the unstable caregiver that adopts Oh Dae-su upon his release and falls in love with him.  Oh Dae-su's best friend No joo-hwan is played by the paunchy Dae-han Ji and fills the role with believable friendly support.

The images in this film are startling.  Oh Dae-su eats an Octopus.  (Apparently, Choi Min-sik is a Buddhist and had to do prayers after this scene.)  The tongue scene was gruesome & hard to watch.  The actor who plays the blond assistant to Lee Woo-Jin also did an excellent job throughout the movie.  The cinematography is top rate.  From the prison set that looks like an Asian Motel 6 to the penthouse to the outdoor images, ""Oldboy"" visually impresses the viewer.

2315621,5,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy is, in my opinion, one of the well-made films I've ever seen.  Park Chan-wook has developed a magnificent way of storytelling, filled with visceral and disturbing images that work effectively toward the overall.  The idea of an ordinary man abducted and torn from his family only to be locked in a cheap hotel room for 15 years FOR NO APPARENT REASON is genius.  He has five days to figure out why this was done to him and exact his revenge.  I'd say that any smart Hollywood scriptwriter is probably mashing his brains on how to spin this into a US blockbuster (I don't blame them: the Indian film Zinda already ripped it off).

The acting was top-notch, especially Choi Min-sik's Oh Dae-su character.  I think he totally killed in this role (betcha didn't know that octupus he ate was actually REAL?!), and the supporting roles of his tormentor and his lover were also very good.  Park knows how to pick his actors and evidently can motivate them to do any role, no matter how disturbing the matrerial.

Obviously, I don't want to divulge the secret that this tale has to tell.  After all, it is the secret that drives this entire story and will bring audiences to a nerve-shattering but satisfying climax.  The DVD is filled with special features, but I suspect that the special metal box edition is certainly the must-have for any fan of this film.

I just finished 'experiencing' Old Boy (it somehow felt more like an experience as opposed to merely watching the film) and was quite happy to find it wasn't a ""horror"" movie, as it had been advertised. Rather, I would characterize it as a psychological thriller or revenge thriller.

The film was purposely frustrating for the first forty minutes or so - neither the audience nor the protagonist knew why he was imprisoned for fifteen years. However, once he is ""freed,"" the film really picks up,  the surprises are plentiful, and the ultimate realizations really push the envelope. While some may find it slightly ""twisted"" (American viewers like myself who aren't used to seeing some of the topics depcited in our Hollywood films), it is shocking in a good way - very thought-provoking and a great discussion piece.

While I recommend this film for those who aren't queasy, are interested in psychological thrillers and the concept of revenge, I do not recommend it for anyone under 15 years old (or thereabouts).",1172275200,3,1160,4.873096446700508

Be careful of what you say about anyone - you never know how your words can (and will) affect their (and what is most important your) life. And the last but not the least, revenge is the dish better served cold, 15 years cold. Without spoiling anything, no matter how far and how fast we try to get away from our destiny, each step would bring us closer to it until the inevitable and shocking ""Appointment in Samarra"".

I have mixed feelings for the movie. It is very impressive, and trying to take the story in its second hour to Sophocles's realm was a clever twist but something stops me from pronouncing it great. The more I think the less I like it and the reasons are incoherent plotting, very ambiguous moral equation, and technical sloppiness that insult my intelligence.

Threre are two things that impressed me the most - fascinating performance by an octopus (sadly, it was its one and only performance) and the story of a guy with a little dog that we never heard. I'd love to hear his story.

I won't rehash the entire plot, since that's been done in other reviews, but suffice to say that our protagonist has been kidnapped for no apparent reason and imprisoned in what amounts to a motel room for 15 years.

There's great character building here, with none of the main players being simple one-dimensional cutouts.  The fight scenes are blissfully free of cliche's like whip-crack punching sound effects and the like, are very nicely framed, and show a hero who, for once, emerges as battered and tired as you'd expect in reality.

The entire film is beautifully shot, and you find yourself really sucked into the story.  This is, by the way, a story-driven thriller with a touch of film noir in the voiceover, but never ever drags because it's just so darned interesting.  I was hooked to the very last frame wondering what was behind it all and how it would all turn out.

As for the disturbing voilent elements that many mention, I didn't see anything over the top, certainly nothing worse than we've seen before.  And it's never gratuitous - there's a reason, either plot-wise or to invoke the viewer's emotion, for those mild shock/cringe moments.  The imfamous octopus scene will have you squirming, though, but in a giddy ""I can't believe they did that"" way.

The ending is the only reason I don't give this 5 stars.  Without giving away any spoilers, I think the protagonist's final confrontation with his nemesis was overdone - even considering the fact that he is toeing the line of desperation.  This is a small thing, though, not a deal-breaker, and the film resolves itself nicely and completely.

Definetely buy.  We need more great drama, great characters, great cinematography, and great story like this in movies.",1166400000,5,1958,4.820359281437126

yeah, just like how he directed hero & hostel, right?

alright rant aside. this film is one of the best films to currently be coming out of the east. i believe it is one of the best(and one of the more original) revenge thrillers out there. the story is amazingly sinister, the settings are both beautiful & grim, and the acting is top quality, especially the lead of Dae Su, i cant recall the actor's name at the moment, but he created a truly colorful, yet cursed character who really grows onto you through the film's progression, all the way to it's disturbing finale.

one thing i'll give tarantino credit for is his appreciation of films like these as well as the tons of others you probably won't ever see. i just don't understand why people must emulate ""his"" movie interest, oh well i guess that just makes people feel more ""original"" *rolls eyes*

i also recommend checking out takashi miike's black society trilogy or the infamous ichi the killer if your into the gritty underworld of asian cinema.",1165104000,8,1225,4.631336405529954
2315660,5,B0009S2T0W,"South Korea has been making some outstanding movies these last couple of years, but unfortunately not many people have given enough credit to these remarkable movies.

The director Chan-wook Park showed what he was capable of doing in South Korea with his first smash hit movie Joint Security Area.

After that he went into a complete different territory with the very dark, but excellent thriller Sympathy for Mr Vengeance.

Due to it's dark theme Sympathy failed to attract the repeated success of Joint Security Area.

Did that stop Chan-wook Park from making more movies?

Absolutely not!

Chan-Wook Park is back with a Vengeance himself giving us the Ultimate Revenge Masterpiece Oldboy!

I wish I can comment more on this movie, but doing that could be a threat in spoiling this amazing experience in cinematic history!

Instead I will focus my review on the acting and direction of the movie. As many are aware now, the movie revolves around a man imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years. The motive of the movie is revenge. But the most important answer to all this revenge is WHY????

This movie will litterly have you nailed to your seat. Yes, it's very violent, I would say graphic as in the likes of Last house on the left, though NEVER exploited in that sense. This movie is all brains!

The direction is the first thing that will have you in awe. From the first 15mins of the movie, you will see how masterfully this movie is shot. In a split screen scene you will actually feel what this man has missed in those 15 years imprisoned in this apartment. His anger for his imprisonment, the complete mess in his look and clothes are all truly convincing by Choi Min-shik who has appeared in two other big Korean movies which are Failan and the award winning movie at Cannes last year Chihwaseon.

As I have already mentioned the violence is very graphic and will probably be rated in the USA NC17. Which is understandable. But do not let that cursed rating put you off. This movie is bound to have you talking and discussing for days if not for months. Just be very well prepared for the final shocking twist!

Well done Chan-wook Park you have showed the world what a truly excellent film director you are. Oldboy gets a well deserved 10/10",1164499200,13,2252,4.644836272040302
2315661,5,B0009S2T0W,"I'm surprised to see that no one else has written about this collector's edition DVD package because it's so cool that it needs to be spoken about in some form or other. It comes in a metal box which is exactly the same dimensions as the box that the HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" came in. There's that which is already pretty nice but inside is where you find the real treasure. The film comes in a three disc set, each one in an individual slipcase with one of the three main characters in the film on the cover. The presentationof the film is on par with, if not above the quality of the previous Tartan video release in terms of picture and sound. This set has a 6.1 DTS mix which is nice, clear and loud. The picture is very nice as it should be, since this film is beautifully shot. There are plenty of bonus features like commentary and featurettes but the third disc has the best supplementary feature which is a production diary from the entire shoot. I think this is one of the shining examples of a behind the scenes documentary done right as it really shows you what goes in to making a film and how much hard work it can be. It's lengthy, it's detailed and thankfully, it has English subtitles because I don't speak a lick of Korean. Just for this documentary alone, this set is worth picking up.

Finally, you get not only a 35mm film strip encased in a nice cardboard sleeve, you get a miniaturized graphic novel of the original similarly titled Japanese Manga that the film was based off of. If you've seen the special edition of Sin City that came with the Hard Goodbye graphic novel, it's just like that except its printed in reverse and you have to read it from back cover to front like you would with an actual Japanese book! (Don't worry, the language is in English so you can still read it)

This is easily one of the best recommendations I can make. If you love the movie, this is a no-brainer. If you know someone else who loves this movie, this would make a great gift. Either way, this is one of the coolest all around DVD packages I've ever picked up and believe me, I've picked up plenty.",1164240000,50,2116,4.327455919395466

Upon his release he sets out to revenge his captors and understand why it all happened. What ensues is a hardcore psychological thriller with plot twists, cool fight scenes, a superb narrative style, and sweet cinematography. This film went gangbusters on the festival circuit pulling down some prestigious awards, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's mainstream. Bring this film to any conservative mother and you will see one of two things: a forceful backlash or a permanent nervous twitch from trauma. The film is stunning, but I recommend it only to people with their mind wide open.",1161907200,11,751,4.921259842519685
2315673,4,B0009S2T0W,"Old Boy is the second film in the Revenge Trilogy by Park. The first is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the final being Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.

After being imprisoned for 15 years, Ho Dae-su (whose name means ""getting along with everybody"") is released and finds he only has 5 days to find his captor and seek his revenge. Once the captor is found, Dae-su will learn about a past he conveniently forgot and find he is in for an even bigger surprise during the final confrontation.

The film is mesmerizing, hypnotic, and well edited with flashbacks and jump cuts. Park makes an elevator ride feel like a roller coaster. There is a notable fight sequence referred to as the ""one-take corrider scene"" where Dae-su takes several men in mostly hand-to-hand and hammer-to-head combat.

This is a powerful film. It is a meditation on our addiction to TV, the bloody thirst for revenge, and the tomfoolery your mind resorts to when it is forced to relive your memories. The film will make you question the importance of forgetting, forgiving, and the satisfaction, or lack there of, in seeking revenge.

The movie has an incredible build leading up to the finale. The end scene is full of twists. You will be amazed and you watch the truth slowly unravel. You learn that one memory is not as it appears and that another more important memory holding the key to the puzzle was completely forgotten. You will learn that getting the revenge is not the most important thing, but instead be able to live with yourself is. You will find that neither man will be able to do so, which leads to an explosive ending. There is also a bizarre, if not disgusting, love story at the center of this.

Favorite Quote: Too many good ones to mention. It is a tie between ""Be it a grain of sand or a rock - They both sink"" and ""Revenge is good for your health, but Pain will find you again.""

DVD Extras: Commentary, Multiple Deleted Scenes, Interview with director, Still Gallery, and Trailers from Tartan Asia Extreme.

Bottom Line: You will be entranced while following the plot and pleasantly shocked the surprise ending. I will be seeking out Park's other work as well and I suggest you do the same.

Rating: 8.5/10

I tend to be a little squemish, and nothing here bothered me that much (but to be fair, I closed my eyes during the tooth pulling scene).  The whole octopus thing, was unpleasant but nothing here made this a horror movie.  It reminded me of a less stylized Kill Bill.

The ""big reveal"" is a twist I didn't see coming, but it left a sour taste in my mouth and a few questions...

2315676,4,B0009S2T0W,"""Oldboy"" could have been a terrible, terrible movie, bordering on pornography.  The story is an unsettling tale of vengeance, murder, suicide, mutilation, sex, more mutilation, and incest.  The movie seems to focus on what human beings will do in the name of justice, and then twists darkly into an exploration of the ugly aspects of truth.

The plot seems to be simple enough at the outset.  A drunken man is making a fool of himself at the police station, babbling incoherently about missing his daughter's birthday party.  Finally bailed out by his friend, the drunk is swiftly kidnapped off the street by forces unknown.

And he is kept in prison for fifteen years.  15 years of one room, one TV, and a whole bunch of fried pot stickers.

And then, he is freed.  He does not know why.  He does not know who did this to him.  He just knows that he must find seek vengeance.

Virtuoso filmmaking elevates this story - one that has a pretty high body count but gets a lot more ""mileage"" out of its torture scenes (and there are quite a few) than the killings.  Indeed, the most disturbing death scene involves the live octopus famously consumed at dinner.  This is movie where several body parts are sliced off, penetrated, or pried out of their natural locations, and ""Oldboy"" shows none of Quentin Tarantino's restraint - remember when Mr. Blonde cuts off the cop's ear off-screen in ""Reservoir Dogs""?  Very little happens off-screen in ""Oldboy.""

""Oldboy"" is one of those dark, ultraviolent films that has a lot to say and doesn't really leave you feeling all that good at the end.  But like other ultraviolent films like ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or ""Menace 2 Society,"" or even (in its own way) ""Natural Born Killers,""  that uses its extreme violence and subject matter in an intelligent, entertaining way.  Just be warned - this is far from the feel-good movie of the year.  But if you can stomach it, it's a pretty darn good flick.",1158883200,6,1934,4.682492581602374

2315679,4,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy's beginning had me excited for the rest of the film.  I mean it is a great beginning.  Oh Dae-su is kidnapped from the middle of the street one night, and we then learn through his narration that he will be in his cell for the next 15 years.  We go through the journey with him, seeing the time pass by as he finds ways to get himself through each day.  Then, miraculously, he is released one day for what appears to be no reason whatsoever.  Once he is released, he sets out to find his captors.  The only clue he has is the food that he ate on every single day for the past 15 years, so he goes to every restaurant named Blue Dragon until he tastes the food he knows so well.  Once he finds out where he was kept, he has to find out who and why, and that is where the film goes crazy.

The twists at the end of this film are some of the best I can think of from recent film history.  Not only is the subject matter hard to handle, but the film also features some horrible scenes of violence, and one scene where a live octopus was definitely harmed in the making of the film.

2315680,4,B0009S2T0W,"The consensus of critical opinion is that Chan-wook Park's  ""Oldboy"" is one of the true cinematic masterpieces of the past decade. In both plot and technique, it is, indeed, incredibly brilliant; on those points alone it deserves four stars out of five. I understand why ""Oldboy"" has so many ardent admirers (chief among them Quentin Tarantino, for whom Park could be suspected of tailoring this film). Yet, though I have a reasonably strong stomach for cinematic gore, I found ""Oldboy"" to be a little TOO sadistic. When you compare ""Oldboy"" with Tarantino's own work--""Pulp Fiction"" and the ""Kill Bill"" movies--you realize that Tarantino's movies have a cartoonishness about them, a hip and ironic remove, that reminds audiences they're just watching a movie after all. There is no such remove in ""Oldboy."" I have nothing but praise for the performance of Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae-su, the heedless, obnoxious but not really so bad guy who is imprisoned, tortured and toyed with for 15 years. I have never seen such a realistic, heartrending cinematic portrayal of abject grief as Choi's at the end of this film, when Oh Dae-su discovers both his torturer's identity and the full extent of his treachery. And this is precisely my problem: the film's emotions are too real. Obviously I'm in a tiny minority about this, but I simply felt too sorry for Oh Dae-su to get the requisite thrills from this thriller. Vincent Vega and Beatrix Kiddo are, as Tarantino intended, pulp fiction; Oh Dae-su is flesh and blood--and BOY, do we get to see that demonstrated, very graphically indeed. Reviewers have equally high praise for the other films in Park's trilogy, ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" and ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance."" I think I'm going to wait a while before I check them out, however. The DVD transfer of ""Oldboy"" is sharp and excellent, but the film has been dubbed rather than subtitled (not really a problem, except for the annoyingly chirpy voice of the actress who dubs the character of Miko).

I saw this film before I viewed any of the other ones in the trilogy. ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"" was my favorite, but this middle film in the trilogy comes in a close second. It is a very deeply disturbing film, and I would not let young minds watch it. The character Oh-Dae-su, (Min-sik Choi) gives an outstanding and riveting performance in this film. As the films narrative begins, the protagonist, Oh-Dae-su, is kidnapped while making a phone call to his wife and daughter. The film then veers to what appears to be a run-down hotel. Only this is not like any hotel you would want spend the night in. He is kept in isolation, and is given a diet of dumplings. As the days turn to weeks, the weeks to months, and the months to years, we witness Oh-Dae-su age. But why is he here? Why is he being held captive?

Oh-Dae-Su does not know why this is happening to him. Who could do such a terrible thing? And more importantly, why? This bothers Oh-Dae-Su as well, and he begins to write down ALL of the names of people he feels he has wronged in the past. No matter how trivial the transgression may seem. In the meanwhile, he attempts the insurmountably long and arduous task of trying to escape, by chiseling his way through the wall of his room with an extra eating utensil that he was accidentally given on his eating tray. But this will take many years. With a TV set to keep him company and the always constant meal of dumplings, he finally awakens one day in a suitcase on the top of a building. He has been kept in isolation for 15 years.

Moreover, when he is released into the world there have been many changes in not only the world around him, but in his personal life as well. But, these changes in his personal life are intentional. The antagonist Woo-Jin Lee (Ji-tae Yu) who was responsible for having locked up Oh-Dae-su has a purpose. There was a reason for the number of years why he was imprisoned. And this is where the film takes on a revenge that will shock you. Oh-Dae-su is given a cell phone and a wallet with money. The antagonist Lee tells Oh-Dae-su that he has 5 days to discover why he was locked up. And thus begins a search by Oh-Dae-su to discover not only the identity of his captor, but why he was locked up. I do not wish to spoil this great film for you, therefore, I will not write further.

""Oldboy"" is an imaginative, high-energy film that keeps the viewer guessing right up to its final moments.  Shot through with dark humor, stylish directorial touches, and cartoon-style (albeit fairly graphic) violence, the film is deliberately disorienting in the beginning, the better to approximate the confused psychological state of its protagonist.

2315711,5,B0009S2T0W,"2003 would go down as the year a master filmmaker emerged from the ranks of the independent circles to the forefront of elite directors. Chan-wook Park was already well-known amongst the indie circuit as an innovative director coming out of South Korea's burgeoning film industry. He'd already released such well-received films as Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In fact, the film in question that's propelled Mr. Park to the forefront would be the second part of a film trilogy dealing with the existential nature of vengeance and its effect on all involved. Oldboy follow's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance like a sonic boom and inproves on the first leg of the trilogy in every way.

Oldboy at its most basic is a revenge film. It is a film about a man wrongly and mysteriously imprisoned for reasons unknown to him and to the audience. We see Dae-su Oh --- the man in question --- through his 15 years of mysterious imprisonment and we see him change from the Average Joe from before his kidnapping to a taut, volatile and somewhat insane individual whose only goal in life is to find whoever did this to him and make him pay. Dae-su Oh's imprisonment takes a good part in the telling and makes up the first third of the film's tale. As the years go by we see him spiral down to the lowest depths a man can get to before sanity leaves him. There's no evidence that he didn't go insane during his imprisonment, but Park sure does show us scenes that Dae-su Oh's singular focus to find out why he was imprisoned and to exact revenge on this involved might have just unhinged the poor man in the process.

The second part of the tale being told occurs the moment Dae-su Oh is suddenly --- as mysteriously as his imprisonment --- released. One moment he's still in his prison where his only contact with the outside world is the TV in his room and then he's on the rooftop of a building with new clothes on and a suitcase with more clothes and his notebooks where he's listed all the names he thinks may have caused him this wrong. From here Dae-su goes on a whirlwind search to find clues and information on who may have imprisoned him. Along the way he meets the young sushi chef Mi-do who seem to have taken some interest in Dae-su Oh's well-being and who slowly falls in love with him. It is their journey through the maze and labyrinth of false leads and trails that dominate the second third of this tale. It is also the part of the film where Dae-su Oh's monster persona takes precedence as he wreaks havoc on anyone and everyone who may have the information he needs to solving the mystery of his imprisonment.

Many have already mentioned the wince inducing pliers scenes and the single-take corridor fight scene. But it is the lovemaking scene between Dae-su Oh and Mi-do that I consider the most pivotal scene of this part of the tale. With the two characters finally consummating their mutual attraction to each other we see the two as not separate entities but a singular one where both will reap whatever their search will sow in the end. Mi-do becomes less of a sidekick and more of an equal partner in Dae-su Oh's search. She knows that the only way she and Dae-su would find true happiness together is if she helps him finish his quest even if it means finding the truth that may not be to their liking.

The third and final part of this tale finally puts to light just who exactly is the mastermind of all that has transpired. The clues picked up by Dae-su Oh starts to fall into place and the puzzle that opens up for him and the audience is nothing less than tragic and Shakespearean. This third part really hits the audience between the eyes about the nature of vengeance and how all-consumming it can be if allowed to simmer, grow and take root. We see how it has already driven Dae-su Oh to the brink of madness and how he teeters just beyond the point of no return. Then on the mastermind of the whole thing we see how one slip of the tongue in the distant past of all involved has consumed this individual to exacting a complex and appropriate plan of revenge on Dae-su Oh. As the tragic and heartwrenching final part of the tale weaves and continues to the end no one ends up being the victor and all become just the victim of the cycle of violence and vengeance thats taken hold of everyone.

Chan-wook Park's direction was flawless and there's not a wasted scene from beginning to end. Every scene was shot and edited with a sense of purpose to convey the mood and feel of the situation. It didn't matter whether it was a a slower-paced scene where the actors conversed in intelligent dialogue or a scene full of frantic energy where burst of violence seemed both randomly shot but choreographed at the same time. The composition of the scenes and his judicious use of wide-angle and static shots with little editing helps convey the the single-minded focus of Dae-su Oh and his main antagonist. Some of the scenes even show hints and clues to the audience that --- as unlikely as it might seem --- the whole film might be a figment of Dae-su Oh's fractured mind as a consequence of his imprisonment. Chan-wook Park doesn't answer whether it is a figment of Dae-su's imagination, but the theory is there for people to ponder.

The screenplay as Park has written from the original Japanese manga is excellent and doesn't waste unnecessary exposition to distract the audience from the main tale being told. Everything said and acted on the screen ultimately leads to the shocking climax in the end. In fact, I would say that the climax of the film doesn't happen until the very last second of the film before everything fades to black and the credits roll. That's how tightly written and focused the screenplay was.

Then there's the three main characters as played by Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, and Hye-jeong Kang. These three actors play their parts to perfection. Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh was a picture of focused madness. We invest in his quest for vengeance and as the final secret was unveiled we truly feel his shock, horror and anguish. Ji-tae Yu plays the mastermind of the whole thing with icy calculation. This was a man who had spent half his life working on, preparing and letting loose the events that would lead to him finally getting his revenge on Dae-su Oh. The two, though after the same goal of vengeance, are diametrically opposed in terms of look and personality. Then we have Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do, the young sushi chef caught in the middle of this duelling vengeance tale. She was both endearing, innocent and the pure soul that keeps Dae-su Oh from spiralling into final madness. It truly becomes tragic that the final consequences of the vengeance wrought by both male principals impacts the female in the middle and in the end she remains oblivious to the truth and Hye-jeong Kang conveys this sincere, innocent naivete to sweet perfection.

There's much more to say about Oldboy, but its really just more accolades to be heaped upon a near-perfect film. A film exploring the darker side of man's inhumanity towards one another to satiate their self-righteous quest for so-called ""justice"" and retribution. Like Cronenberg's A History of Violence, Park's Oldboy also shows the unending cycle of vengeance heaped upon vengeance in addition to the violence it inherently breeds. Like Cronenberg's 2005 film, Oldboy doesn't fully answer this existential question but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. Chan-wook Park's Oldboy is a film that comes but once in an era and helps redefine an era of its place in film history. Oldboy also continues the vengeance trilogy Park has confirmed will be finished with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (shortened to just Lady Vengeance here in North America). Oldboy makrs the true arrival of one of the new masters of film and he joins the fine company of such people as Spielberg, Coppola, Scorcese, Cronenberg, Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa and Lean. A near-perfect film all-around. 10/10",1151884800,12,8006,4.657001414427157
2315712,5,B0009S2T0W,"If you've never got into the whole 'world cinema' thing, then you're missing out on what cinema's best and most unique filmakers have to offer, like South Korean director Park Chan-wook.

Oldboy is the director's second film in his revenge trilogy that started off with Sympathy For Mr Vengeance in 2002.

Oldboy starts off with the main character Dae Su Oh drunk and being held in a police station, but is soon bailed by his friend. The credits kick off when he is talking to his daughter in aphone booth telling her he got her a birthday preasent, his friend then talks to his wife on the phone, he calls Dae Su to the phone but is nowhere to be seen, the only thing that is left behind is the bag that he was carrying his daughter's birthday preasent in. This is when we find out he's been kidnapped, and he has no idea why he is being locked up, but while locked up he has a TV in his room that he says is your only friend, clock , and lover, on this TV he finds out that he is a wanted fugitive for killing his wife. He then builds a plan of getting out and get his revenge on the person who did this to him. 15 years later he is free and is given new clothes and a cell phone, the man who did this to him is giving him five days to find out why he was imprisoned for 15 years, so 15 years of being curious wouldn't go to waste.

That is what I can tell you about the plot but don't want to spoil a brilliant twist that will force you to watch it a second time. This film has the energetic directing and storyline of a Quentin Tarrentino film, and has one of the best and possibly the best fight scene of all time. This film might not appeal to everyone but it certainly is a film you must watch before you die. This film is followed by Lady Vengance and is the final film in this revenge trilogy.

A must-have.",1151366400,29,1816,4.064245810055866

I was very wrong! The film is a terrific adventure, full of surprises, with an excellent story and superb acting! The Korean cinema has definitely some new tricks to show and the story itself is an acrobatics on the edge of human feelings. Love, hate, thirst for revenge, are taking turns under a fine directing touch and a trully marvellous music. This is the best and most enigmatic thriller I have seen in the last few years!

2315715,5,B0009S2T0W,"This is the best and most accurate remake of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" ever made, bar none.  The 1998 French miniseries starring G?rard Depardieu came the closest, especially in terms of strictly following the full plot, but is ruined by the inaccurate ending in the very last few minutes. If you read the full 1300+ version of the Dumas classic, it does not have a happy ending. Dantes does not end up with Mercedes, and even though he learns some redemption and can forgive, he is still torn by what revenge has done to him.  In the real version he goes off with his young mistress and is never heard from again, which is actually similar to Oldboy's ending.

Oldboy captures the psychological despair of revenge in a unique and startling way.  Two characters play Dumas' protagonist, both Dae-su as Dantes, and Woo-jin as the Count, and the revenge they seek on each other is the war within Dantes/The Count himself.

In the original the Count gets revenge on several of his enemies.  This is only implied in the movie.  We see other jails maintained by Woo-jin Lee's cohorts, but we never see who is in them.  Instead we see only Dae-su, who instead of having the Abbe Faria to teach him, learns from an all-knowing TV, and instead of escaping on his own he is released by...himself of course, Woo-jin Lee.

Park now blends Dae-su's search for those who imprisoned him with a horrific look at the cost of revenge both on himself, and his more elegant version, the Count, the billionare, Woo-jin.

There are several clues throughout the movie that both characters are indeed the Count.  In the most overt scene,the girl Mi-do is chatting with Woo-jin, who asks her, ""Is the Count of Monte Cristo there?,"" even though it's clear the Woo-jin is the Count, since he is controlling the whole revenge plot and he is the megarich tycoon. Dae-su immediately recognizes that Woo-jin is the one he is looking for.

Later, Dae-su almost kills Woo-jin, who is protected by a character similar to the Count's mute Nubian slave, Ali.  Woo-jin tells Dae-su, ""You are the monster I have created.""  Dae-su is the pure rage of revenge, the wounded and unrefined soul of Edmund Dantes, the evil angel on the Count's shoulder who has consumed his entire being, shown through the extreme violence he inflicts on others, including the ability to kick ass on hordes of attackers and torture them if need be.

In one telling scene Woo-jin explains how he has hypnotized Dae-su and controlled his life.  Park splits the screen and blends Dae-su's and Woo-jin's faces together to show they are one and the same person.

In the end Woo-jin comes to terms with Dae-su and having nothing to live for, having spent his revenge, almost kills both himself and Dae-su with a single bullet.  Instead he lets Dae-su/Dantes live and the Count is killed off, in the same way that the Count disappears from Europe in the original story.

There is an Oedipal modification to the story with the dual incests of both Dae-su and Woo-jin, which again shows both characters are the same person.  Both have lost someone they love.  This is Park's wonderful updating of the near killing of Mercedes son, Albert, who could have been Dantes' son if his life had been different.  Park's modern update keeps the psychosis of the revenge deep with the characters, as opposed to Dumas' revenge secret, the transferred letter that starts Dantes' imprisonment in motion.

Park's realization of this classic novel is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It is a stunning post-modern realization of the novel, and is more tightly bound to the original story than you might think.  Read the story and watch the movie twice or as many times as you can.  The links will become apparent each time you view it.

From a psychological point of view, this is unquestionably the best remake of the novel both as a story and a movie.",1145491200,8,3875,4.710682492581602
2315716,5,B0009S2T0W,"This is one of the most unusual films I've ever seen. Combining Kafka, David Lynch, and Tarantino, the film pits a sociopathic sadist against an innocent man as it explores what happens when one becomes a victim of one's own wrath and hunger for revenge. Because so much of the film relies on plot surprises, I will only say that a man tries to avenge his enemy and in the process he encounters his own inner demons.

Perhaps more than any film I've seen, this movie is relentless in its intensity, both inwardly and outwardly. It is one of the most painful films I have ever witnessed but the suffering is not forced or gratituous. It is the result of a deeply thought theme--the tragedy of not knowing the difference between defending one's honor and exacting revenge.

2315739,5,B0009S2T0W,"I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason. Well, I'm glad I just decided to go 'what the hell' because it IS actually really, really good.

Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews, I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets, imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for 15 years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone. He has 5 days to find the man who imprisoned him and why.

An absorbing set-up and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a wicked dark sense of humor. The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns, always keeping us on the edge of our seats.

There are some brilliant fight scenes and some truly bizarre moments, such as a live octopus being eaten whole. But what really floored me was the ending. I won't tell you a tiny little bit of it. But...wow! As is the case with EVERY SINGLE Asian MOVIE, Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood. Because anything that the Asians can do, Hollywood can apparently do better. In my opinion this film really doesn't need a remake as this version is strong enough to appeal to the whole world.

Too bad most of the planet are philistines who would rather 'watch' a film than 'read' it. A complaint I hear often enough. If your impression of Asian films is they are all shoddy and not very modern looking then, in the case of Oldboy, you are very much mistaken.

Among the many strong points of the movie are the faultless editing and stunning photography. Oldboy is the slickest movie I have seen in a good while and can easily out-gloss anything by Michael Bay.

Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. If you don't love it then you truly have no business watching films at all. I'll save you time and tell you outright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious ass, leave the more important films to the brainiacs.

2315740,4,B0009S2T0W,"*

As mentioned numerous times already, ""Oldboy"" is based on a Japanese ""manga"" story. Being otherwise unfamiliar with that original story, my own personal observations and interpretations about this movie may in fact be way off. Then again, it just may very well be possible that there were indeed some very significant and deliberate departures from the original source material which just might validate my interpretations and observations -- like, for example, the different variations of the (essentially) same story between the book and movie versions of Orwell's ""1984."" Several sources have in fact already stated that the movie adaptation is ""loosely"" based on the original manga story and deviates from it to a large extent. Even if this so, by my being limited with only the film version of ""Oldboy"" as my guide, I can only address the deeper aspects of this story based solely on what seems apparent to me from that perspective.

When an obnoxious, boozing, womanizing salaryman is kidnapped off the street right outside of the police station where he was being detained for drunken & disorderly conduct (on his little daughter's birthday, no less), he finds himself imprisoned in a ""hotel room"" where he is fed, monitored, drugged, and mentally conditioned. Once he realizes he is in ""for the long haul,"" as it were, he begins to reflect on who just might have hated him enough to torment him in this way and for such a long time -- it just so happens that he has a very long list to work from, as he has stepped on many toes throughout his life. With only a television as his companion, he uses it not just to keep track of time and watch the march of world events but also to educate himself on things both educational and news related -- one of the things he learns is that he is now considered a dangerous fugitive, accused of having murdered his wife.

Just when he is beginning to get the sense that his efforts in planning his escape are about to pay off, he finds himself mysteriously released on the rooftop of a building near where he was snatched off the street fifteen years earlier. His only motivation now is to find out who did these things to him and to his family, find out why they were done, then to exact revenge.

Discovering the ""who"" part of the mystery is not too difficult, as the ""who"" in question leaves very deliberate clues on how & where to be found, even by way of making personal audio/visual and physical contact at unexpected times & places. The ""why,"" on the other hand, requires a bit more digging. When we finally do learn ""why"" at the climax, it turns out that it was all part of an extremely elaborate-- and extremely demented --revenge plot the kidnapper had actually devised and carried out. The kidnapper's excuse for ""revenge,"" however, had little to do with what his ""victim"" was allegedly guilty of having done to him -- the sadistic ""cat-&-mouse"" game he had set into motion was far less about getting ""payback"" for an egregious trespass as it was much more about trying to asuage himself of his own guilt.

=&nbsp;&nbsp;=

. . . what is about to follow borders on

~ ''spoiler territory'' ~

(proceed with extreme caution)

Regarding the big (and very disturbing) ""reveal"" at the movie's climax, again, I have no way of knowing whether the original ""manga"" story went in this direction or not, so this interpretation could be all wrong. But as I view it (at least from the standpoint of the ""film"" version), I have very strong reasons to believe that that the main character's (Oh Dae-soo's) ""girlfriend"" (""Mido"") is *NOT* whom we are made to believe (read: ""suspect"") she is! I base this interpretation on several very blatant (but oh so subtle) observations:

First (during one of the earlier scenes) is when Mido impersonates a newspaper reporter asking about the surviving member of Dae-soo's family, gets the address, and is told that conversation was maintained with the individual over the years, but that it was becoming more and more difficult to converse, since the person had been so long gone from Korea and that after having been totally immersed in a new language and new culture the command of the 'mother tongue' was slipping (which would be very consistant with the type of situation being described).

Another observation concerns the contents of the ""box."" When Dae-soo rifles through the pages of the ""book"" he sees a ""very select"" collection of what his adversary had intended for him to see. Under the stresses and pressures Dae-soo was already under as a result of his hunting for the truth and fighting any/everyone connected with it, would it not be a safe bet to assume that his mind would not have been focused and rational enough to question, examine and ""scrutinize"" what he was being manipulated into viewing? If he had clearer faculties at the time, where he could analyze not only the ""visual"" cues but also what was being told to him, Dae-soo might have noticed that what he was looking at revealed large gaps with very little ""transition period"" space between ""past and present,"" and he might have realized that he was merely being ""effed"" with in an attempt to get him to reach the ""conclusion"" he did without examining the ""evidence."" Think about it -- what was happening to him in this scene is similar to what happens to each and every one of us day after day in the ""15-second sound bite"" world we live in (for example, recall that ""no emphatic statement"" was ever made that there was any connection between the ""September 11, 2001"" attacks and Saddam Hussein, yet close to half of the U.S. population still believes that there was some sort of a connection, with people who rely on ""TV News"" [soundbite-based media] as their primary news source being most susceptible to the mistaken belief, while those who rely most heavily on ""Newspapers/Magazines"" and the ""Internet"" [scrutinizing & analysis-based media] are shown to be the least susceptible to the misinformation).

Another giveaway relates to the person who ""kills"" Dae-soo's knowledge of what his adversary had implanted into his brain. Note, first of all, that when Dae-soo is being ""released"" the ""first"" time (""physically""), it is the same exact person he calls upon in the end to ""release"" him for the last time (""psychologically""). Why? Obviously it is because Dae-soo knows that this is the same person who was responsible for ""mentally conditioning"" him in the first place to keep him ""trapped"" at the orders of his adversary; and knowing this, Dae-soo calls upon this person himself (knowing this person's effectiveness at ""mental conditioning""), but this time in a desperate plea to be ""set free."" Apparently moved with pity and compassion at Dae-soo's repentance at his realization that his actions throughout his life have done much to hurt and disrupt the lives of so many people, the ""programmer"" decides to ""kill"" the ""memory"" of the ""truth"" that Dae-soo was confronted with in his adversary's penthouse suite. Why was this done (and why was this particular memory-- and not any of the others --selected to be expunged), rather than going to work on Mido and instead making her forget her feelings for Dae-soo? It defies logic -- UNLESS it is a clear indication that Mido is not truly whom Dae-soo was ""made to believe"" that she was!

So who was Mido, really? Some girl who got selected at random? Someone else (or a relative of someone else) who p! ssed Dae-soo's captor off? Or someone some other person had an issue with and wanted to have tormented in their own twisted act of revenge who's case got ""transferred"" to-- or ""bought out"" by --Dae-soo's tormenter? Who knows. But it seems obvious to me, after some careful examination, who she is NOT!

Keep in mind, Dae-soo's captor did not necessarily have to link the two actual people that he claimed they were together -- if he could get away with it by ""faking"" it, all the better! Think about it: a THREE-FOLD way to torment his victim -- (1) by making Dae-soo suffer for the rest of his life by having him believe that he had done something socially reprehensible to somebody he loved; (2) by making Dae-soo suffer for the rest of his life by placing him in a situation where he must continually hurt the woman who ""loves"" him by constantly avoiding her and rejecting her love for him; and (3) by placing Dae-soo in the extremely uncomfortable (to say the least) ""Catch 22"" situation where either his silence on the issue or his revelation of the ""truth"" causes nothing but internal conflict and has the potential to do irreparable damage to Mido. Then there is the ""fourth"" torment -- after having suffering through this new wave of guilt, Dae-soo could always find out later the truth that Mido really was not whom he had believed she was, which would cause him even more guilt and pain because of how he would have treated & behaved around Mido prior to his finally having learned the ""real"" truth, which would also would have resulted in even further torment to himself for having so blindly rejected the love she would have tried to give to him and upon which he could have sought genuine comfort.

Dae-soo's captor had already proven time and again that he was a master manipulator who knew how to use psychology and a person's deepest fears and taboos against them -- so why would it be so difficult to accept that what Dae-soo was being put through was actually one very well crafted and highly elaborate ""mindphuk""? What was ""really"" in Mido's ""box"" which she (and we) never got a chance to see? Could it have been empty all along? What about the thug's ""hand""? Sure, it was his ring, but whose ""hand"" was it? (could it have come from a cadaver via a nicely bribed coroner?) -- and was the prosthetic the thug was ""wearing"" quite possibly a ""phony""? Was Dae-soo's ""internet cafe"" owner friend ""really"" murdered as he was told over the phone? See my point?

Of course, like I said, I could indeed be all wrong, and the original ""manga"" story could emphatically tell me that I am merely grasping at straws in order to envision a more palatable outcome to this story, and to a certain point I will confess that these explanations as I've laid them out would certainly sit better with my conscience. But even if the original manga does indeed go the ""more taboo"" route, I still express a great deal of confidence that my observations-- based on the ""film"" version --are valid.",1144281600,5,10411,4.734142305570877

True, the theme of incest may be a little too heavy for some viewers, and I couldn't help but notice that the few people on Amazon who rated this movie low did it only for that reason. These people actually let a 'taboo topic' jade their views to the point where it overshadowed all the great points of this movie. Such a shame. This is not a movie that promotes or glorifies incest; it simply uses it as a backdrop for the story, and that's it.

2315784,4,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy (Chanwook Park, 2003)

I'm not sure why, but I was expecting Oldboy to be a far more violent movie than it actually is; those of you who got the same impression and haven't yet seen it, be aware that while it's a very odd film-- very odd indeed-- if you go in expecting Ichi the Killer, you're going to be disappointed on some level.

We open seeing Oh Dae-Su (Sympathy for Lady Vengeance's Min-Sik Choi) drunk in a police station. (Watching the DVD's sole deleted scene, an extended version of this opening scene, will both help it make a lot more sense and give you a strong appreciation for the editor's job.) His best friend, Cheol-woon (Dal-su Oh, also in Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) comes to get him, and they stop at a pay phone on the way so Oh Dae-Su can call his wife and daughter (whose birthday it is) to let them know he's on his way home; as his friend wishes Oh Dae-Su's daughter a happy birthday, Oh Dae-Su vanishes. (I'm being a bit more expository here than usual, because it took me about thirty minutes to understand how the opening scenes connected to the rest of the film.) Oh Dae-Su wakes up in a prison-- though it's not by any means a normal prison-- and there's an extended scene about his day-to-day life there, during which he slowly goes insane. Fifteen years after he is first imprisoned, he gets out, vowing revenge on those who imprisoned him-- as soon as he can figure out why they did it. Think Kafka, but with more claw hammers and less existentialism.

The best thing about Asian mysteries, aside from the obvious fact (obvious, anyway, to those who watch them) that unlike Hollywood, the Asians assume their audiences have a modicum of intelligence, is that Asian mysteries are usually surprising when the big reveal comes about. I don't know whether this is a function of me being an American watching them; perhaps, if I'd grown up in the culture, I'd watch Oxide Pang, Chanwook Park, and Kyoshi Kurosawa films and be as depressed as I am attempting to watch J. S. Cardone films as an American. I don't think so, though; the simple fact is that Park, who also wrote the screenplay, has come up with a truly twisted mystery, with layer upon layer of surprises just waiting to jump up and punch the viewer in the face. It's not handled in amateur fashion, either; it's one of those situations where you never quite get used to the punches, because each one is just that much harder than the last. And Park varies the delivery methods, as well (the infamous clawhammer scene is so out of place in the early stages of the film that it comes as a shock, but still doesn't feel as if it's actually out of place thanks to Oh Dae-Su's internal monologues. That's good filmmaking right there), so the movie is, while not a continual revelation, a constant guessing-game. It's not only the plot that will keep you watching.

I should probably warn you that if you've got a weak stomach for things that normally gross people out, the big reveal in this flick (and Oh Dae-Su's wonderful reaction to it in the film's final scenes) is probably going to give you the weirds. But then I get the feeling that was Park's intention. Me, I was just impressed that Park had done such a great job of setting it up, and I'd completely missed it.

2315787,5,B0009S2T0W,"I came across Old Boy at my video store when I was running out of movies to rent and decided to try a different genre. Right from the beginning this movie intrigued me (I watched the dubbed version first) by the voice of the narrated dialogue of this frustrated Dae-Sue who wakes up captive in an apartment after an obnoxious drunken night at the police station. He doesn't know why he has been kidnapped, but never gives up and only becomes angrier and set on revenge. He ended-up a total of 15 years in this apartment eating fried dumplings and fairly well taken care of.
The movie has surreal undertones and has striking cinematography as well as beautiful western classical music playing in the background. There are also some pretty decent action fights when Dae-sue becomes free and while seeking revenge takes on several men at a time with a hammer while he has a knife sticking from his back.
He meets a young girl named Mido, and eventually meets and finds the man responsible for his 15 year kidnapping (after tasting all the fried dumplings in town, since that's all he ate for 15 years, and that's how he makes the connection). Woo-Jin, who also performs excellently, gives Dae-su 5 days to figure out the puzzle or Mido will die, but I'm not going any further.
This movie is brilliant because it has humor, action, a love story (not too much unnecessary sex), great music, a brutal, and haunting twist at the very end. The plot is unusual since it begins in a way that is somewhat predictable, then goes a different way that is somewhat perplexing, but if you sit it out all comes together marvelously at the end. The second time I watched this movie with subtitles, and agree that it had a better effect.
When you watch this movie pay attention to when Woo-Jin says ""When you live for revenge and once you get it, you still have to live with the pain"".",1137801600,7,1866,4.540059347181009
2315788,5,B0009S2T0W,"Well, that title is perhaps a cheat, as I believe it was actually released in most of the world in 2004 and South Korea in 2003, but I've noticed that some real critics like to go by the year the film came out in their country, so I'll let it slide.

Though 'Oldboy' certainly isn't popular, it has gotten quite a lot of underground buzz, and it seems like it always gets compared to the work of some better known director, either Fincher or Nolan or Tarantino or Miike or whoever.  Comparisons can be useful, but they tend to suggest that the film or director is clone or knockoff, and thinking this would be a grave disservice to Chan-wook Park and 'Oldboy'.  This is a strikingly modern film, slick and beautiful in its hyper-technological, urban setting, with an occasionally fractured narrative filled with both dark humor and gruesome violence .  So the comparisons are fairly accurate, actually,  but Park has a knack for putting it all together that it's clear that he isn't imitating anyone else.  It all holds together underneath, with strong storytelling and genuine human interest beneath the attractive surface.

You've probably already heard to premise: A drunken and surly, but still seemingly good-natured man named Dae-su spends a night at the police station just before he is abducted by a mysterious stranger.  He's placed in a small apartment devoid of any human contact for 15 years, until he is suddenly released one day.  Dae-su wants revenge, but he perhaps even more than that, he wants to know why this happened to him.  During this he meets a young lady, Mi-do and quickly finds the man responsible for his imprisonment, Woo-jin.  Woo-jin makes a sort of deal with him: If, in the next 5 days, Dae-su can find out why all this happened, Woo-jin will kill himself.  If not, he will kill Mi-do, along with every other woman that Dae-su ever loves.  This may make the film sound rather plot-intensive, but it actually isn't.  Dae-su actually solves the bulk of the mystery fairly easily, the plot generally moves quickly in leaps and bounds between the moody, surreal scenes and various setpieces.

`Oldboy' is perhaps the best looking film of last year.  Park composes his shots with great care and it's all sleek, fashionable and modern.  And though it isn't an action movie is still has some cool fighting.  There is one very rough, extended single-shot fight that is becoming quite famous, and rightfully so.  The use of music is also fantastic, with various repeating themes manipulating the mood nicely.  You need great music in order to build up a sorta operatic grandiosity and intensity which this film has in its best scenes.

The performances are all great, particularly Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu as Dae-su and Woo-jin, respectively.  Most notably, though they are hero and villain, both of these characters prove to be exceedingly likable and sympathetic once you find out all there is to know.  Dae-su is definitely one of the best protagonists in recent film history, combining an undeniable bada**ness with inner turmoil and self-doubt.  Woo-jin is interesting in that he is rather non-threatening looking and has a fairly playful demeanor that he rarely drops.

There are plenty of movies out there that I really like simply because they have so many neat ideas and look so good.  `Oldboy' works on this level, but it also has some real human interest and emotional impact that most films are lacking.  You can really feel the pain of being locked away for so long with no contact, and the scene where Dae-su and Mi-do say goodbye before he heads of to confront Woo-jin is really quite powerful, as are a number of things which happen during the climax of the film, though I can't go into specifics.

 I've heard some complain that the ending is slightly drawn-out, and while this is something of a problem it's pretty much the only real concern I have with the film, and it barely matters.  I must note that the denouement will likely put some people off, and not without good reason, as it is rather strange and perverse.  I was sufficiently into the film that I went with it despite the disturbing implications, but others doubtless will not. (Judging by the critical response, however, I believe that most people will go along with it.)  Also, the film does have a significant twist in it, but it's not totally the heart of the film. Well, I should say, it's crucial to the plot, but the whole point of the movie isn't simply to have the rug pulled out from underneath you at the end.  I'm interested to see how they'll deal with this twist in the American remake, as I'm sure execs will assume that such a twist will be upsetting to many viewers, but if you change it you pretty much have to come up with a whole new plot.

I guess I'm tired of writing.  Check it out, and whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!! I repeat, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!!!

2315819,5,B0009S2T0W,"I popped Oldboy into my DVD player expecting to see a pretty decent movie but I got something way past that. First do not buy this film expecting to see a martial arts or action packed film because this is not packed it's just the right amount to keep you interested. There's more torture than fighting as you see Oh dae-su seek the ultimate revenge after being kidnapped and held for 15 years and then for some crazy reason he's let go.

 By this time your probably thinking Oh dae-su has some bit of control over his life after being released but his napper tells him different. Whenever Oh dae-su thinks he's getting some control he is pulled back like a dog on a leash. He figures out he has not really been released just let out for some air. The napper tells Oh dae-su he released him because he wanted him to know why this was done to him and who did it and he only had 5 days to do so. You think you know who's getting the revenge but you don't really know.

This film surpasses anything your thinking about it and the twist makes it worth every penny. I actually jokingly guessed the twist before it came and had the biggest jaw drop ever when I found out I was right, that's how unbelievable the twist is.
This film is so unique that you have to see it because there is no way you can find a twist in a movie in America like the one in Oldboy so get ready to be surprised.

2315822,5,B0009S2T0W,"I was drawn to Oldboy because I had heard that the twist at the very end of this movie was one that couldn't be beaten. I had heard that before, though, so I was skeptical when I bought it. I figured, yeah, the twist may not be as exciting or surprising as some say it will be, but I know that at least I'm getting a good movie. That was true for Oldboy--it is an excellent all-around movie--and the twist itself paid off big time. I've never been floored like that in my life.

Oldboy follows the fifteen year journey of a man named Oh Dae-su who is married, has a child, and an obvious penchant for creating problems for those around him. He is suddenly taken from the streets of Seoul, and imprisoned inside a room for fifteen years, given food, TV, writing materials, a shower, everything a person can live off of, except simple freedom and the answers to his questions. During his time here, he trains himself to fight, records everything he did up to his current days of imprisonment, and attempts suicide twice, both failures. But then he's suddenly drugged and hypnotized, and wakes up outdoors, on the roof of a building, dressed in a nice suit with all of the few possessions he had had inside of the room. He soon learns that he's been framed for his wife's murder, and his daughter has been adopted by Swedes. And he has one thing on his mind: find out who imprisoned him and kill them.

I won't go on from there, because I may spoil the twist for some people. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are great; it's as if the actors were placed in a room and told to fight for their lives. It looks real. The actor who plays Oh Dae-su plays this role brilliantly. He's funny and dramatic, and carries with him in his appearance all those years of imprisonment. The story itself plays out slowly, releasing tidbits of information, enough to keep you interested long until the next small lump of info. While not an actual mystery, you still feel as if you're trying to solve Oh Dae-su's problem along with him, as he makes it easy to get inside of his head.

I can't recommend this movie enough. I wonder why films like this get ignored so easily. Oldboy is smarter than anything Hollywood has made in ages, with superior acting, a great soundtrack, and an intense well-plotted story.

2315826,5,B0009S2T0W,"Best Foreign movie EVER!

Oldboy is a Korean film, obviously made on a very short budget that is nothing short of brilliant. It has been compared to Tarantino movies and may I ask: what's up with that? Sure I enjoy some Tarantino flicks but this has nothing to do with them. The pervasive language label on the back is in all fairness a bunch of b.s. Mr. F is barely used.

There isn't that much violence in the movie but when there is, it's intense. The violence is there for a purpose: for example, one scene is a sacrifice and another is vengeance. The one brawl the movie has is great! The protagonist (don't know his name) and his hammer makes these 15 men's lives a living hell.

Yet there were very few fights which surprised me. But the ones there are..are great!

On the other hand this movie lives off of the ingeniously woven plot. The violence is only a product of that, only used with a purpose. A man, preparing for his daughter's birthday is abducted and thrown in a room. He is framed for the murder of his wife and spends 15 years of his life there. Who did it? Why? This will all be found out in due time. When he is released, he's given a suit and a cell phone where his abductor calls him. He meets a young woman and falls for her. She helps him, shows him love, and helps him get revenge. But things are more complicated than that. And if you want to see a twist, the huge one at the end will knock you flat. It will haunt you and maybe bring tears to your eyes. The ""sacrifice"" is the true meaning of love, and it shows the good nature of our hero. This hero isn't only a but kicking bad a#$ like Tarantino would have made him out as, no...He is someone who really knows about love and is such a courageous person that he will do anything for that person. And this is what American films lack, a moral. And this twist isn't like the dark crazy ones in Amercan cinema, it is an unusual one, an unexpected one. It's a touching tale, a haunting tale, a sad tale. It will make you think a lot and behind all of this violence and revenge is love and that love is the true meaning behind this ingenious tale.

He immediately starts to seek out his kidnapper, a quest for vengeance which leads him to the unspeakable reason for his imprisonment.

It's hard to say anything meaningful about this movie. It is by turns brutal, tender, violent, heartbreaking, baffling, disgusting, and hilarious, but these are mere adjectives. Its impact is so direct and visceral as to render further discussion superfluous; each image will sear itself into the memory for a long time. It is one of a very few movies that attain the depth and mythic power of Greek tragedy (Vertigo being the only other example I can think of), yet it's totally pulpy and modern. By the final shot of Oh Dae-su's vacant, hapless smile, I felt almost as if I had been physically violated, yet I was utterly spellbound.

I think it's already a good sign when a film doesn't leave everybody indifferent. Actually I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand I liked ""Oldboy"" for being rather unusual, on the other - there were many complex things difficult for comprehension. Partly because the storyline is intricate, and partly because of asian mentality which is sometimes rather sophisticated (at least for me).

The plot is flawless and that's a very good thing, because you don't have to say to yourself all the time: ""That's not possible, I'm not buying it"". There were some things and characters' actions that seemed unmotivated, but again I tend to explain it with mentalities distinctions, I don't think those were the plot holes.

Anyway even if you are not going to like ""Oldboy"" you'll have to admit the film is different. Some say it reminds ""Ichi the Killer"" (which I haven't seen), to me it seemed reminiscent of ""Memento"", they share the same mood of despair and gloominess.

""Oldboy"" is very stylish and well-crafted, every scene and every shot look like they're on their place, it's very elaborate and beautiful (although there are many violent moments). Many scenes became instantly famous among cinephiles, like the corridor fight scene, that lasts several minutes and is done with one take. Especially I'd like to mention brilliant music which is the third part (or even the half) of film's success.

I'm sure I'm going to watch ""Oldboy"" for the second time to clear certain things out, but after the first viewing I was left with the impression of something fresh and innovative, which appeares rather often lately when watching asian (and Korean in particular) movies.

After a while trying to readjust to society and figure out what's happened, he is given 5 days to wreak vengeance upon whoever took his life away from him.  Unfortunately, the progress is being watched by a less than benevolent spectator.

What's interesting about this film is it's influences.  It's based loosely around The Count of Monte Cristo, takes a lot of Shakespearian and Biblical elements, throws in typical Asian kung fu, and then puts it into a very modern stylistic context in terms of cinema.  The best part about this movie's style is that it never actually feels overdone and it actually seems to make sense...  a shot isn't canted just to be weird, it's more subtle than that, even if the tone itself bleeds the idea of style.

Honestly, I was taken simply by a single shot, a long take where the camera tracks along a hallway as the main character fights off a large group of people.  It straddles the line between realism and romance and creates a distructive ballet of choreography and motion that is downright beautiful in a somewhat horrible way.  Then setting it into the context it has to a rather well done and structured story really helps this movie have a profound effect on the viewer.  Just don't expect to be coming out of this feeling very happy, as it gets a bit disturbing at the end.

It may have overdone the ending, but I don't care.  The weird mix of hypnosis and not-hypnosis kind of constricted the story.  It is interesting to note that this film is of a new group of films out there that a few people call Asian Extreme Cinema, and I've seen two other films from this neo-genre that involve heavy use of violence and hypnosis themes (and men cutting their own tongues out).  Why do these images seem to tie this genre together?  What is it about hypnosis, specifically, that creates an anxious desire in these filmmakers for broken vigilantes?

Such is the fate of our hero Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi, in the role of a lifetime): a buffoon, a drunken Korean businessman loaded up on too much booze and a night of excess, busted by the police, booked into jail, urinating in a corner of the police station, barely bailed to freedom by his old friend Joo-hwan---and who, seconds later, on a busy Seoul thoroughfare, outside a phone booth, minutes away from his wife and infant daughter---disappears.

Without a trace.

Without a trace to his family and friends, perhaps---but certainly not to his tormentors. For Oh Dae-Su awakes in confinement, in what appears to be a seedy flat in a seedier tenement, confined, imprisoned, given no answers, provided food and water, and gassed each night for the Cleaners to make---ahem---'adjustments'.

It's enough to drive a sober man stark-raving mad, don't you think?

It's even worse that Dae-su, entombed as he is in the guts of the City, cut off from any explanation---why is he here? when can he get out? who has done this? My God, jailer, won't you talk to me?---panicked, hopeless, desolate---is nonetheless in contact with the outside world: through television.

Call it his book of days. He sees the days stretch into months, the months stretch into years. He hears the news report of the atrocious, brutal murder of his wife, her throat slashed at the hands of a shadowy brute, his infant daughter whisked away into the protective clutches of anonymous Officialdom.

A happy man, one instant: a Prisoner, the next.

Years pass, and then the greatest trick of all: Dae-Su is released. Sprung. Baptized atop an office tower, sprung from the womb of an oversized suitcase, left to find his own way, bereft of family, life, place: suspected as the murderer of his wife, years ago. A Man without a face, without a name, without a country. With one thing, and one thing only: Revenge.

Oh, and a cell phone, and a wallet full of money, passed to him by a nameless beggar who claims to know nothing: hungry, tired, dispirited, Dae-Su tears through a pack of thugs---all that karate +-practice in his lounge-lizard-prison having paid off handsomely, evidently---checks into a juke-jive, bites the head off a squirming, hapless octopus, and meets a sweet young thing---Mi-Do---who is instantly horrified, and compelled.

And then the real fun begins.

Now: it would be unfair to say much more about ""Oldboy"". It is a stark, searing little testament to the power of guerilla filmmaking, a laurel wrapped about the head of its creator, Chun-Wook Park, who has managed to graft high style with a weird kind of cinematic poetry, an elegiac cinematographic high style, married to a sere, haunting, neo-classical soundtrack (with snippets of Vivaldi): all of it builds up to a crescendo that is nothing short of catharsis. It's an exhausting film: it makes demands.

The cinematography is its own character here, as is the direction: there is a kind of wild elegance, in the rain-swept streets of Seoul, of the spare interiors, of the weary, craggy, hell-beaten topography of its hero's face, seamed with bewilderment and agony. The battle sequences---there are a number---are kinetic, yes, but for all the high style, feel real: you can feel the skin buckling, the bruises forming up purple-yellow, the sullen exhaustion of the combatants.

And beyond and above it all is the central question: what is Vengeance? Who is the Avenger, and what is avenged? The acting---from Choi to Hye-Jeon Kang (Mi-Do), and all the supports---is supple, and completely compelling, adding to the grandeur of this shivery little tale of grue and moral kurare: ultimately the big reveal is more devastating for its precision---its preciseness, its measured planning---than anything you might have expected.

Brace yourself.

2315847,5,B0009S2T0W,"This was an extremely difficult film to watch.  It starts off Kafkaesque, and even from the beginning it is very hard, if not impossible, to know what is fantasy and what is real.

Oh Dae-su has been inmprisoned for 15 years and he has no idea why, or who has done this to him.  Upon his release, he finds a young woman, Mi-do, who is extemely attentive to him.  The rest of the movie centers around these two people and uncovering the secrets which led them to each other, and in identifying and dealing with his nemesis.

In particular, the relationip betweeen the young woman, Mi-do, and the protagonist, Oh Dae-su, does not appear credible, but this and other happenings which appear to be unexplainable come together at the end.

The musical score is beautiful, and forms a counter-point of sorts with the violence of the film.

There is a lot of violence, and some of it is so extreme that I did not know if the violence was meant to be real, or was it a fantasy, a dream in the mind of Oh Dae-su.

While the ending ties most of the movie together, you have to have a strong stomach to get there.

This has to be one of the strangest films that I have recently seen, and although I finally came away with a sense of satisfaction with it, it is too intense, too difficult a film for me to recommend to anyone I know.",1131840000,4,1321,4.294354838709677

But I want to say that ""Oldboy"" is one of the best shocking films I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of movies. Trust me when everyone writes about 'what a great ending' one must be curious of the ending and maybe for that reason one should buy or rent this movie to atleast experience the buzz. This movie could be watched many times and each time the viewer will discover new clues and messages and foreshadowing.  This isn't the type of movie an American viewer should wait for the Hollywood to remake, because this isn't the type of movie hollywood will ever have the guts to make or remake. So watch this Asian movie (Asian movies are good people and subtitles aren't a taboo) and the dvd also have english language dubbed. I really don't see the fuss about the movie being short for American release because it did read 120 minutes as the original is supposed to run, so don't buy into those comments that this is a cut version (because I'm surprised they even got a R-rating and they haven't cut anything or I wouldn't be surprised, right).",1131062400,4,1244,4.427947598253275
2315859,5,B0009S2T0W,"Chan-wook Park's amazing flick ""Oldboy"" is a modern day Shakespearean type saga of deceit, vengeance and reprisal played out against a current South Korean setting.

Oh Dae-su, played amazingly by Min-sik Choi, is a womanizing Seoul businessman, husband and father of a young daughter who is inexplicably confined in a private prison cell for 15 years.  In his solitude his only attachment to the outside world is a TV.  While watching he learns of the brutal murder of his wife, orphaning his child.  From that point he musters all his power to sharpen himself both physically and mentally for revenge against those who immersed him in this predicament.

After being released he embarks on a blood thirsty campaign of vindication.  While doing so he becomes befriended to a young female sushi chef Mi-do played by an innocent Hye-jeong Kang.  They eventually fall in love and she supports him in his quest.  Soon after his released he is outfitted with a cell phone and wads of cash by his tormentor.  It is established that he is to be given 5 days to ascertain the reason for his incarceration by his captor or the life of Mi-do will be forfeited.

This last part of the flick chronicles Oh dae-su's voyage of discovery as to the genesis of the deeds that caused his plight.  What is revealed is a stunning sequence of events leading to an unpredictable and ironic conclusion to an extremely well crafted and written plot that is superbly directed by Park.",1130976000,2,1459,4.772908366533865
2315860,5,B0009S2T0W,"Imagine a Hitchcock thriller crossed with Raymond Chandler's ""Farewell My Lovely"" with a twist of David Lynch thrown in for good measure and you'll get an idea about how inventive, startling and powerful ""Old Boy"" is. Chan-wook Park's film dazzles with stunning imagery but more importantly with a brilliantly supversive mystery at its core. Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped after a celebratory night. He was headed home for his young daughter's birthday when he disappears. When he wakes up he finds he's a prisoner in a cutrate hotel without windows and a metal door. His meals are slid under the door to him, his only companionship is a TV and his grip on sanity begins to slip away after 15 years of confinement. Suddenly, he's released without explanation. He's given a cellphone, a wallet full of money and 5 days to discover who imprisoned him and why. Filled with rage when he discovers that his wife was murdered and he was framed for it, Oh Dae-Su tries to try down his young daughter with the help of a sushi chef he meets and gradually falls in love with. This twisted, dark tale has more twists and turns than a mountain road. Oh Dae-Su gradually unravels the mystery which stands at the heart of his existence but with each bit he unravels he discovers more unanswered questions.

The image quality on this disc is extremely good as is the sound. The film can be viewed in the original Korean (although English is the default language for the film)and there are subtitles which, amusingly, don't always match what the English dubbed track has. Featuring a director's commentary as well as deleted scenes(with optional commentary) and theatrical trailers for this film and others in the Tartan Asia Extreme Cinema DVD releases, ""Old Boy"" like ""Momento"", will keep you guessing all the way to the conclusion. If this was an ordinary mystery, I'd say it would be worth viewing one time but the dazzling directorial skill of Park and the strong performances by the actors (as well as the well written script)make this graphic, violent suspense thriller worthwhile.

You'll be glued to your seat as you try and put together the pieces of the puzzle about why this ordinary man's life is taken apart and, more importantly, why he has to put together the pieces of the mystery to regain his life again. Highly recommended.",1130630400,,2319,4.795

Oldboy is probably the best foreign movie I've ever seen as well. The story is woven so expertly throughout and it would've been easy for another director to have finished the movie with loose ends or plot holes. After seeing Oldboy, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded. The movie is pretty powerful in certain spots and has scenes you'll be thinking about for weeks. Do yourself a big favor and see this movie knowing as little about it as possible. You'll be in for quite an emotional expierence.

2315864,2,B0009S2T0W,"The whole movie centralizes one theme: Revenge. Dae-su is imprisoned for 15 years not knowing why, and subjected to gas and mind control. Then released. You will understand why he was imprisoned in the end.

It's a two hour movie, but I found myself bored with the majority of it. Sometimes fragmented going from one scene to another with no apparent order, but it all comes together in the end. I gave this a two stars because the movie could have been done in ONE hour.

It also has a very very long sex scene which grossed me out. I really did not want to watch so much sex (something reminding me of porno), and it was entirely too long. You understand why the sex scene was shown in the end, but I thought it was WAY too long. The message could have been put across with just 1/4th the amount of sex scene. I considered it a ""filler"" to use up time. made the movie even more boring.

I felt like during the watching of this movie..waiting..waiting..waiting for something to happen. I was mostly bored.

The last 20 minutes is exceptional. Everything comes together. But I was thinking why do I have to sit through 1-1/2 hours which only led up to this point? In short a lot of the movie dragged and dragged and only 20 minutes of it was really good.

It earned five stars among critics, but I honestly wondered how. Just the last 20 minutes...but I felt bored watching this before this point. If you can get this movie rented, by all means get it.

2315865,4,B0009S2T0W,"After hearing everyone talk about Oldboy in my East Asian Cinema class, I decided take the plunge and see it at the Nuart. I didn't know what to expect, which is probably a blessing; expectations can go a long way towards ruining a film.

Dae-su, the protagonist, starts out as a useless drunk. Then, seemingly for no reason, he is held in a room for fifteen long years, left with only a television to entertain him. His meals come from a slot under his door, and every once and while he's knocked out with sleeping gas. When he wakes up, his hair has been cut and he's been given a shave. Through his TV, he learns that he is being charged with the murder of his wife. Someone clearly has revenge on his mind, but who? And for what purpose?

Since the plot hinges on a central revelation, I won't say anything else about it. Instead, I'll talk about some standout scenes. In a cinematic moment that has become infamous already, Dae-su (who looks just beastly with hair teased within an inch of it's life) walks into a sushi bar after being released and asks to eat something ""alive."" He chomps into a live octopus, but before he can finish, he faints, one tentacle still squirming. On a visceral level, I was repulsed. But then I remembered that this guy just missed out on more than a decade of living and just wanted to feel vital again. In some strange way, my heart went out to him.

Eventually, Dae-su figures out where he was incarcerated. So great is his fury that he storms in without any forethought, armed only with a small hammer that he picks up along the way. In a long shot of a hallway, he does battle with his former jailers, displaying an emotion I can only categorize as ""primal rage."" Even a knife in his back can't do much more than slow him down. What made the scene captivating was the fact that violence was used to highlight an emotion, rather than for mere shock value.

If you have a strong stomach and a taste for black humor, you'd do well to see this movie.",1128297600,5,1987,4.376693766937669
2315866,4,B0009S2T0W,"Park Chanwook's OLDBOY is a powerful movie, but I can't recommend it without some qualifications.

OLDBOY is ostensibly a revenge tale, but, as our main character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), closes in on the man who imprisoned him for 15 straight years, it turns into something a little deeper than its flashy Tarantino-esque style in its first hour may indicate: it turns into an almost poetic drama about the human cost of revenge. When you see our hero humiliated at the end, you won't think that revenge is sweet any longer. (Tarantino made an attempt at this at the end of KILL BILL, VOL. 2, but then Tarantino is perhaps too infatuated with obscure old movies to really be able to convincingly pull off such a humanistic gesture with the conviction Park shows in OLDBOY.)

Revenge movies have always been somewhat morally problematic, especially in modern movies. It's become an action cliche that when someone close to a hero dies, the hero may show a flash of pain on his face, but then he'll collect himself, stand up, and go after his nemesis with even greater force. Obviously, it's an understandable impulse, revenge---but, as even Shakespeare tried to show in HAMLET, it's rarely as simple as that. My memory of HAMLET is a bit faulty, to be honest, but I remember that none of the characters were painted in broad strokes of black or white, and that Hamlet's quest for revenge had an effect on the people around him (especially his sister Ophelia). And of course there's Hamlet himself: thirsty for revenge, but always over-thinking his every move, perhaps too passive a character to ever carry out such a thing.

OLDBOY is far from HAMLET, of course. But, in its own gritty way, its view of revenge---as an inhumanly vicious cycle---is similar. It may not have the nuances of Shakespeare, but it has a poetic intensity at the end of it that can only be described as ""powerful.""

This could have been a great film, though, if Park didn't at times seem so eager to shock for the sake of shock. I mean, seriously (and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler): did we really need the whole incest thing thrown in? And, of course, the violence is occasionally graphic, and filmed in a way that may lead some people to dismiss Park as un-serious in his mostly-pessimistic view of vengeance. There is one scene that is problematic in this regard: one in which Oh takes on a whole bunch of cronies wielding a hammer. Most of the fight is filmed in one long take, and it is probably a scene that wouldn't feel too much out of place in Tarantino's KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (you know, the more violent installment, heh). For a director who makes a big show of decrying the inhumanity of revenge, he does make some of the violence look awfully cool.

But that's not being totally fair to Park, I don't think. Yeah, there are problems in OLDBOY, aspects in which Park's shock tactics go a little too far. Overall, though, I think this is one violent film that doesn't take the pain out of violence, both physical and emotional. You're not hyped up to cheer the revenger here; Oh Dae-su is a sympathetic but not necessarily likable hero (and the actor, Choi Min-sik, doesn't really attempt to make him likable, either). I mean, does he really have to rip the teeth out of a bad guy, like he does in one particularly gory scene? Park's point is that revenge has taken over Oh's life in such a way that it has made him less of a human being. Better this than the stupid (if technically well-made) action revenge sagas that Hollywood has occasionally produced in recent years.

2315889,5,B0009S2T0W,"What a ride!  ""Oldboy,"" has been labeled a revenge flick - which it certainly is.  It also has all the classic trappings of Noir, which may elevate things a bit, since such careful attention to noir elements reflects a careful construction behind the carnage.  Of course, you couldn't tell that from watching the first twenty minutes or so - which is humorous and completely different in tone when contrasted with what follows.  Still, if you watch carefully, the seeds of the story, and the fate of Oh Dae-Su (the movie's anti-hero), are all there.  The movie's ""secret"" or mystery really isn't that big of a secret, and if you've watched noir flicks at all or have read your Jim Thompson, the characters' fates are not such a surprise. Shocking -- always, no matter how many times you've seen or read it, but not a surprise.  But I'm not revealing anything more here.

The movie has loads of style (which is probably what attracted Tarantino's interest), and the story unfolds nicely - in a very pulpish way, while Oh Dae-Su, the whole time offers up pithy existential nuggets of hard won wisdom.  The movie starts out almost as a comedy, turns surreal (Salvador Dali weird) as Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously imprisoned for fifteen years.  Then it shifts gears into grindhouse action, and closes with a Sergio Leone like flourish - operatic, over the top and totally cool.  Probably the only movie I've seen that believably shows a man fighting 15 others - with a hammer.  It was like the Thriller from Manilla - kung fu version. Grueling. Brutal.

2315890,3,B0009S2T0W,"Oldboy probably does rate five stars when it comes to the traditional categories.  This is an intriguing story with passionate, yet not overdone, acting.  The scenery is so intelligent I'd call it landscaping.  However, there is a Korean word that describes my difficulty with this film--JONGSEO.  My clumsy translation of the word is ""intuitive moral spirit.""  Director Park embraces a postmodern ""whatever works"" ethic in this revenge film about an obnoxious drunkard who finds himself imprisoned for fifteen years, and then embarks on a quest for revenge and answers.  He does not know why he was taken captive.  During the journey the victim grapples with revenge, love, and ultimately right and wrong.

My reason for downgrading the rating is the conclusions this film draws.  ""Even though I am a beast, don't I have a right to live?""  This is the key line of the film.  However compelling this plea may seem to be, the bottom-line for Oldboy is that traditional mores, be they about family, love, and even compassion for humanity, are meaningless.  Whatever passions may captivate us, proclaims the story, we have the right to act on them...because even beasts deserve to live.

Bottom-line:  5 stars for cinematic qualities, but one star for degenerate social commentary.  Those viewers with religious convictions are especially encouraged to avoid this movie--it will leave you feeling unclean and despondent.",1127520000,7,1417,5.207964601769912

2315892,4,B0009S2T0W,"It's a rarity nowadays to find a movie that would captivate you from beginning till the end.  This movie did exactly just that.  The setting was mostly grim, on a rainy day, in a cell, in a room with fluoro-green colour, on the top floor of an office building, and so forth.  It truly excelled in putting the audience on the edge and enabling the audience to feel the pain and grosteque that the people were going through.  The movie didn't intend to have the audience empathise or feeling sorry for the main character who was imprisoned for fifteen years.  Rather, we were more intrigued to find the cause of imprisonment.  Naturally, the ending was as disturbing as the movie was and it didn't disappoint.  If you  think that the ending would be the imprisoned main character gotten his final revenge from his captor, you would be hugely disappointed because the theme of this movie would be running off the tangent in every sense of the way.  When classical music was playing whilst the torture was going on, it gave this movie a haunting but lasting beauty that would imprint in audience's mind for many years to come.

I know I will never watch a film like Old Boy again but I do know it will reflect in my future conversations. I am not even ashamed of downloading this film. Atleast I watched it.

This film is about revenge and has more suspense filled raw staggering control over the viewer than I can possibly comprehend in my little review. The story is about as unique as the design of the wonders of the world. The movie covers a lot of aspects of a man's life. What value does time have? Do we really forget everything we know? Do elevators actually have passwords for the penthouse right on top? Do men actually have a remote control controlling their life support?

Now now, I know how vague and random I might sound but Old Boy actually did this to me. It is the most potent display of human thought I have seen in a long time. I remember watching ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" and being disappointed not by the story but by the frail enactment. ""Old Boy"" contains more thought and hardcore action than quite a few movies put together. It leaves most behind in terms of quantity of mind.

I don't want to start with the actors and storylines because I do not want to ruin it for you. My favourite character in the film was the villain. The movie seems way ahead of it's time. At first, the subtitles didn't really help but soon I got used to it and by the end, they only helped more and more.

Old Boy keeps becoming more interesting as it grows. When it ended, I had my hand on my mouth and my eyes just about as wide as to make me look uglier.

Oldboy is completely sick, twisted, taboo yet beautiful at the same time. Your emotions just go on a rollercoaster throughout the movie. From the minute the movie starts it just grabs you, never a dull moment in this one. The story is so gut wrenching you won't be able to get it out of your head...when the movie ended I just sat on my couch stunned thinking I can't believe what I just saw.

2315902,5,B0009S2T0W,"For years I shied away from foreign films, Asian films in particular. I'm not a martial arts fan and I didn't want to bother with subtitles. Someone recommended a Korean film to me several months ago and I decided to give it a try. I've since rented several Korean and Japanese films and I'm hooked on Asian cinema. At a time when Hollywood is rehashing the same pointless drivel, finally I find films with heart!

A perfect example is Oldboy. Min-sik Choi plays a scoundrel, a man who gets drunk on his daughter's birthday and is arrested by the police for lewd conduct. The next thing he knows, he is locked into a hotel room where his only human contact is his television and the feet of his guard. He is periodically gassed into unconsciousness when his captors need to enter his room. He stays this way for fifteen years, unaware of who is holding him or why, until he is released one day unexpectedly. This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film. The rest of the film is his search for vengeance on the person or people who stole his life from him.

This is the kind of film you feel in your guts. It's like the first time you watch Charles Bronson in Death Wish. You can't approve of what he's doing but you can't help cheering him on while he does it. Far from the staged acrobatics of a martial arts film, the violence in this film is as gritty and brutal as the best of Scorsese or De Palma. But it makes sense for the film and serves to underscore the theme, as opposed to the gratuitous violence you find in many American films. Far from a mindless action movie, this film has a poignancy that will stay with you for a long time. This is the way movies are supposed to be.",1125187200,6,1694,4.290625

Evidently, I'm not the only one singing its praises. Cannes Film Festival gave it the Grand Prix award (2nd place) and Universal Pictures have bought the rights to the movie for a U.S. remake perhaps staring Russell Crowe.  This film is completely original, with suprises, twists and turns, but the well done visuals don't exhaust the viewer. It also does a unexpected mind job on the viewer and it's often impossible to predict what will happen next. Without spoiling anything for anyone, imagine Kill Bill without the wires and samurai sword (but leave the violence and revenge theme) throw in a dash of Hitchcock (suspense, morality and social corruption) and an ounce of Kubrick (tight, precise film making and wierdness blending with the sublime) and you have Old Boy.

2315906,5,B0009S2T0W,"For those of you worrying that this is an edited version due to the difference in running time, STOP WORRYING.

This is indeed the original, uncut version of the film.  The difference in total running time comes from the conversion from PAL to the U.S. NTSC format.  The Oldboy DVD here is a PAL version because PAL runs at 25 frames/second while NTSC is at 29.  Hence you lose 4 frames/second leaving you with the total time difference.

Also if that is not enough for you, I know people who have viewed this DVD and said nothing was cut so rest assure you are getting the complete film.

Now for the DVD: The movie is easily 5 stars.  The DVD I would give 4 stars.  In Korea, they have two editions, a regular 2 disc one and a mega 4 disc set.  You can imagine the features we are missing out on.  I have the Korean 2 disc set (not Region 1), and I'm getting this so I can play it on my region 1 DVD player.  There could be more features and Tartan has been known to issue two different sets (one regular, the other deluxe).  Regardless, if you're not a stickler about features get this version.  It is uncut, has a few good features, and is in 5.1 DTS sound.  The film is easily one of the best I've seen in the last five years.  Get it.",1124323200,14,1240,4.129707112970712

While imprisoned, Dae-su hears on the TV news that his wife was murdered.  Dae-su swears to take revenge on the person who destroyed his happy life.  Fifteen years later, he is released with a wallet filled with money and a mobile phone. An unknown man calls Dae-su and asks him to figure out why he was imprisoned.

2315908,4,B0009S2T0W,"Imagine the horror:  One day you're walking on a downtown street on your way back from work.  Everything appears normal, until you're suddenly abducted and thrown into a room and locked up in there all by yourself.  You have no idea why, and as each day in your solitary confinement becomes more and more unbearable, the days turn into weeks, the weeks into months, the months into years.  When all is said and done, you've been locked up for 15 years now and you still have no idea why.  Now you're out, and it's payback time...

The premise in Oldboy is fascinating and rarely have I seen a movie that made me sympathize so much with its central character.  We as viewers desperately want Oldboy to find out answers and get back at the people who wronged him.  Even if it means watching him commit cringe-inducing acts of violence such as pulling out someone's teeth with a claw hammer.  Yeech!!  Really, it hits home, Oldboy was a previously mild-mannered gent but after being locked up for supposedly no good reason he's out for blood.  Wouldn't you be?

Oldboy will no doubt appeal to people seeking graphic violence.  Although there aren't a very high number of such scenes, one stands out as being one of the most entertaining in vigilante-dom history, in which Oldboy is able to take on a group of twenty-or-so thugs all armed with knives and baseball bats and come out victorious.  All by himself.  With his bare hands.  This scene was one of the most ludicrously over-the-top things I've seen since Charles Bronson's antics in the all-time vigilante trash classic ""Death Wish 3"".  And the final revelatory scene is shocking beyond belief...

But be careful about going into Oldboy thinking it will be one of the best films ever, which is the mistake I did.  Look, I've seen lots of Asian action movies and this one is surely admirable but why is everyone passing this off as the best thing since sliced bread?  It seems downright trendy these days to jump on the Asian film bandwagon and proclaim any good film that comes out of the Orient as being ""Ultra-Hip"" and ""an instant classic"".  I'm thinking the same people who bestow such overblown praise are the same ones who would tell you that Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" is also a can't miss classic.  If you ask me, Oldboy is plagued by a lot of the same problems as Ichi, namely a sometimes glacial pace, peppered in with overly gratuitous scenes of torture, a story that lacks cohesion and a run time that far oustretches its concept. So do watch Oldboy because it is a fine film, just don't go into it with overblown expectations after reading the many exaggerated reviews on this website.",1123977600,2,2658,4.646680942184155

Living in Korea for a few years has given me a small view into the Psyche here and you can expect many other great films to follw those that you already know about from the Land of the Morning Calm.

Oh Daesu, a sloppy businessman with a penchant for booze, is mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years, during which he loses his mind and gets the best education TV can offer, emerging an embittered and mop-haired avenger. He kicks the crap out of a gang of street punks, eats a live squid, and charms the pants off a mysterious sushi restaurant worker. But why was he banged-up in the first place?

Oh Daesu's quest for answers - and, ideally, justice - is never an easy watch. Shockingly violent at times, downright disturbing at others, ""Oldboy"" is nevertheless shot throw with pitch-black humour and, more importantly, a sense of humanity that raises it above, say, the uber-pukefests peddled by Takeshi Miike.

For mankind's sake, this scene alone will drain your heart and your body strenght so much you'll end up tired and beaten, a lot like the main character.

The movie is really violent, but not in a gory way -there is some gore, indeed- but in a human perspective, the kind that makes you wonder about how low you would get if you were to suffer through the most terrible nightmare. A moment so long and so horrible that once you wake up to reality you've become a terrible monster. Something so powerful pain is nothing but a four letter word to you.

2315947,5,B0009S2T0W,"Amongst actual bloody asian movies such as Battle Royale, Audition, Ichi etc. there came Oldboy and it was hailed to be a Tarantino-like work of violant art. ""If you like Tarantino, you're gonna adore Oldboy"" is what I was told, but then I had already seen it and was really asking myself if these people use their eyes and brains whilst watching a movie. Oldboy is no Tarantino movie by no chance as the main difference between those two directors is that the violence is being represented in a totally different context. In Quentin's movie it serves as a fun factor, but in Oldboy it is exactly what it really is: a destructive, bad kind of power.

To me, there's a LOT more to this movie than meets the eye. Some people had complaints about the idea of a private prison, others found the suffering of 15 years total isolation not believable enough. The answers at the end seemed too bizarre, culprit and victim don't look the same age but should. etc.

In my opinion, they're kind of looking at the wrong stuff as this movie is succesfully creating a very special situation that could not be created by an all too realistic backstory: that of a man on his personal quest for salvation in a world he only knows from television. From the moment of his isolation on, it's all TV. His life becomes a desperate monolog with a TV, he doesn't see his dead wife with his own living eyes, it also is part of the TV reality. The tv is showing the pictures, the tv is informing him about him being a murder suspect.

So this man was made to be a monster. His insanity after 15 years of isolation is desperatly seeking for answers to the question: ""By whom was I made the person I am now? And why?"" And a monster is what he turned out to be then, a monster that is about to fight (with the help of a hammer) against a huge group of brawling prison guards, there's no holding back, whatever it costs - the answers to his quest has to be his salvation.

But then what we see during his revenging quest is a man falling deeper and deeper while in Kill Bill every act of revenge is another positive step to fulfilment and joy.

Not with Oldboy. It's a drama with a few uncomfortable acts of violence. In the end, that's how violence is: uncomfortable.",1118016000,8,2238,4.3701923076923075
2315948,5,B0009S2T0W,"Gripping, intense, powerful do not define Oldboy, but on the contrary, Oldboy defines those words since the powerful start of the movie until the very end.

Perhaps this is one of the best movies/concepts ever made, it will cause a stir between those normal folks who love their movies full of explosion, chases and cliches; since the story doesnt fall into anything predictable and never gives us mercy, not even to catch a small breath.

It is incredibly pointless to talk about the remake that we are going to see pretty soon, since i think that the role of Oh Daesu is way toooooo BIG for any self respecting actor; Russel Crowe cant do it, Thomas jane cant, Benicio del toro being the only good option, but still the role is too big. And what about the magnificient ending? Of course they are going to change it, of course they are going to make it weaker since the majority of the movie going audiencies are not going to accept the original shocking ending.

As a side note: lets all go to see the remake and laugh of one of the biggest cinematic mistakes ever done.

Ps: i don't know about you but Park chan wuk is my hero, for having the real guts for making a movie like this.
