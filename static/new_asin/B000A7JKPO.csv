8075606,2,B000A7JKPO,Disappointing. Maybe I didn't read the reviews closely enough.,1458000000,,62,6.0
8075607,1,B000A7JKPO,Video was very poorly done.  Not enough coverage of dachshunds.  Dachshund owners are very passionate about the breed and would rather see the dogs than the owners.  Waste of money.,1453507200,,181,4.966666666666667
8075608,5,B000A7JKPO,"Lord of the Wiens is the name given to a dachshund racing meet held over the last weekend of April in 2006.  Along with several Extras, this DVD covers that meet.  It includes interviews with race hopefuls and lots of the cutest little dachsies you can imagine.  The main production is rather short, under an hour, but it is worth watching if you like to see real life dachshund behavior.",1453161600,,388,4.514285714285714
8075609,5,B000A7JKPO,"it was nice to see how Buda, TX celebrates it's Low Bellies.  The dogs were all adorable, and their owners were humorous.
Our dog was quite jealous.  I recommend to anyone with Doxies",1387843200,,183,4.515151515151516
8075610,2,B000A7JKPO,I expected something more than just a little documentary about a weiner dog race in Texas.,1258761600,2,90,4.6875
8075611,5,B000A7JKPO,Look it!! I will show this to our dachshund group. We have races and other activities too!!,1246147200,2,91,4.411764705882353
8075612,5,B000A7JKPO,"This is a DVD about the Wiener Dog Races in Buda, Texas. It's not a ""story"" about Wiener dogs unless you count the dozens of stories that unfold naturally in the course of the filming. It's a charming slice of American life with killer soundtrack written by Asleep at the Wheel's Danny Levin.
I think its whimsey and spirit is wonderful. I loved the couple who rescued a Wiener dog on the highway and went on to race him. There are so many amusing things about this movie that it's hard to recount them all without leaving something out.
I have given this as a gift to many people and they all loved it. (I had to give them as gifts because they'd see it at my house and threaten to steal it.)
This film will not enlighten you about the breeds of Wiener dogs but it will certainly shed some light on humans, dogs and America.",1235347200,5,825,4.261146496815287
8075613,1,B000A7JKPO,"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD.  Having three Dachshunds, my family and I thought this would be a cute movie or short story, not Dachshund races (not even good ones at that); it was the same thing over and over and over again. . . very boring and a waste of 16.95!  Needles to say, I would NEVER buy a DVD from this company again.",1231632000,4,340,4.136363636363637
8075614,5,B000A7JKPO,"My Mom and I got even more enjoyment out of this video than we'd anticipated (we're both HUGE Doxie fans).

Almost 2 hours of smiling and laughing til our cheeks and sides hurt.

The best $ I've ever spent. Thank you

8075615,4,B000A7JKPO,"Racing wiener dogs and costumed wiener dogs! For those with a soft spot in their hearts for dachshunds, this is an endearing and amusing video account of the dachshund races and costume contest held annually in Buda, Texas. Kids will like it too.",1162598400,7,246,4.744186046511628
