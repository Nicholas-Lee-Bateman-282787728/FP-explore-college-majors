8308547,5,B001HBVE8I,"This superb documentary is narrated by the late Julian Bond, a life-long Civil Rights activist.  It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the USA, New York and Harlem. The documentary shows Congress' manipulative strategies to prevent changes in segregation laws and Powell's, able and sometimes comical, outmaneuvering of them. Unfortunately, this is all too familiar to those who observe the activities of Congress in 2015.",1450051200,2,470,5.351351351351352
8308548,5,B001HBVE8I,"I really enjoyed watching footage of the actual man, it gave some real insight on who this man was, as I was not aware of him. I only wish there had been more!!!",1409097600,,161,3.909090909090909
8308549,4,B001HBVE8I,"Another excellent film in the American Experience series on PBS. An important film because Adam Clayton Powell paved the way for Martin Luther King, Jr, Malcolm X, and other better known civil rights leaders. A child of privilege Powell quickly learned how to use the power of his church and his pulpit to bring change to the people of Harlem. While he was a powerful force for change, he was also a womanizer, a big spender, and very vindictive if he thought his personal power/influence was challenged.

I recommend this film for anyone wanting to know more about the time period between reconstruction and the civil rights movement of the 1960's.",1400544000,,649,4.846846846846847
8308550,5,B001HBVE8I,Must see. Can't wait to see it again and again and again. I only wish it showed more of his accomplishments. Such as him being instrumental in. Exporting Jazz over seas!,1376956800,2,169,4.483870967741935
8308551,5,B001HBVE8I,This story is one that should be a part of the curriculum in the public school system.  Mr. Powell was a very colorful character and used his knowledge and tenacity to help his people.,1374624000,2,184,4.411764705882353
8308552,5,B001HBVE8I,"If you talk to people who were around during the days of ACP (and having often visited relatives in Harlem as a child, I did), they will tell you that Powell was either a pimp or a prophet. This DVD does an excellent job at examining both sides.

It uses interviews and generous newsreel footage to tell the tale of Powell, who used his good looks and articulation to his advantage to fight for the dispossesed and for his own place in the world. He dazzled the Black poor with stirring speeches that articulated his anger and used his influence as one of the first Black post-reconstruction Congressmen to advance education and civil rights legislation. However, this good side was overshadowed by his love of wine, women, and song (one clip actually shows a drunk Powell ranting at critics) as well as his tendency to skip congressional sessions whenever he felt like it and naked ruthlessness (at one point, the film shows his envy over the younger MLK leading him to start unfounded gay rumors about King and Bayard Rustin). This led his obvious enemies to expoit his weaknesses and partially self-destruct.

Before you note the similarities between this and another arrogant modern civil rights leader, it's an interesting sidenote to consider that in Powell's book ""Adam by Adam,"" he denigrates King but speaks well of Jesse Jackson. Powell was also a mentor to the far cruder Al Sharpton (the one occasion that I met Sharpton, he shared some anecdotes about Powell).

Powell himself is fascinating to watch and hear. I'm glad they used a lot of actual film of him because it helpes viewers to understand why so many people admired him at his best, but the interviews (James Farmer's tale about Powell's donation to a civil rights group bouncing at the bank is priceless) are very enjoyable and Shirley Chisolm's final comments that end the film are quite moving, and put everything in perspective.

The generation of Powell's admirers are advancing in age, and while MLK's role in history is safe, Powell is largely forgotten by current generations aside from the street named after him in Harlem. Love him or loathe him, this film needs to be seen and he should be remembered.",1268784000,13,2184,4.816
8308553,5,B001HBVE8I,"What a remarkable story on this country's most effective legislators in all of history, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.

This film will bring light into the minds of the young people today of this strong tower and pillar of strength and power that many weren't aware. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr is truly as Good as it Gets!",1264464000,8,313,4.589285714285714
