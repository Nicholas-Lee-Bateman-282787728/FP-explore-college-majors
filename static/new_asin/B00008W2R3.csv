1863317,5,B00008W2R3,"Not very many movies make me fall out of my chair laughing but this one does. This movie has a good story to it and great actors. I love Ed Asner and Jody Foster especially. Now some may not think its so funny but anything that uses stick acting, i think thats what its called gets me. For example where a supposed ghost is making you move your arms against your will and the other person sitting with you has no idea why your are doing it. That is what makes me laugh. If that is not your cup of tea, its still a great story. I had to add this to the few dvd's that i must own and not just rent.",1295568000,2,596,3.8536585365853657

1863320,1,B00008W2R3,"I love this movie - it is one of my favorite, but the DVD that I received was so bad, that I can't stand to watch it.  The music and pictures are so muffled and distorted that it ruins the whole movie.  It looks like it was copied off of a very worn out VHS.  I ordered one for my sister at the same time and hers is just as bad, so it isn't just a faulty DVD.",1156032000,11,360,3.58974358974359
