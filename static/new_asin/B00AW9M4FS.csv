5510834,5,B00AW9M4FS,Before I saw this movie I heard bad reviews for it. I thought the trailer was funny so I decided to see it. I'm glad I did! This movie is so funny!,1360540800,10,147,3.625
5510835,5,B00AW9M4FS,"Dont trust the bad reviews. The movie is so funny, my friends went to see it since it got worst movie of this year and at the end they love it. The movie is like someone says i am going to punch you, and you say okay. Then it hurts, and then you say, why did you punch me?",1360368000,14,272,3.6271186440677967
5510836,2,B00AW9M4FS,"Okay, this film is definitely R-rated and ABSOLUTELY NOT ""a family movie"" or ""for the little ones"" in _any_ conceivable way.  But at times, this film composed of a series of shorts strung together by an appropriately flimsy master narrative is honestly very funny ;-)",1359936000,9,267,4.933333333333334
5510837,5,B00AW9M4FS,"A lot of people don't get it.  This movie is meant to be sick, it's meant to be offensive, it's meant to be in bad taste.  The novelty here is that there are big stars in all the roles.  I won't give away any of it, only to say that if you like sketch comedies in the tradition of The Groove Tube, Kentucky Fried Movie and Amazon Women On The Moon, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  And for those of you who think yourself ""above"" the material, get over yourselves already.",1359849600,18,486,4.03125
5510838,1,B00AW9M4FS,"I hear about this movie & that it was getting a lot of negative feedback. I became very curious to see how bad it was......and boy oh boy I wish I never saw this movie at all. This movie is horrible & I really don't know where to start. Okay, the movie is a series of short films with a wraparound starting Dennis Quaid (Dress up like Justin Bieber) playing a screenwriter trying to pitch these ideas to a film executive, played by Greg Kinnear. Each short is really NOT that funny. I did chuckled a few times, but never laugh out loud. I feel unclean after watching it & I know it's a comedy. I know it's supposed be crude, shocking, gross, disgusting, tasteless & offensive. But it didn't work for me. If you liked it than good for you, because I sure didn't. I'm gonna said this right now to you: DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is the lowest forms of humor. This is the bottom of the barrel of comedy. The whole cast & crew who made this terrible movie needs to be ashamed of themselves. All of the actors in this film look like they collect their checks before even reading the script or not at all. You know what this reminds me of. A comedy called, ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"". A really funny & enjoyable film. It's has all the elements like this one, but it's done better. Go see that movie instead of this turkey.",1359676800,12,1317,4.23015873015873

5510872,2,B00AW9M4FS,"Outside Magnolia, this has to be the most bizarre thing Ive ever seen.  Everybody and everything - including the Holocaust - is fair game here, and some of it is uproariously funny.  Unfortunately, though, most of it is just plain weird.  I spent most of the movie marveling at how the producers were able to convince so many a-list stars to appear in this.  I think the movie is supposed to be stupid, but whats the point of making a movie thats supposed to be stupid?  If you're looking for reasons to be offended, you won't have to look far here.  I wasn't offended by any of it, but I would never be tempted to watch it again.",1521417600,2,630,4.296610169491525

5510915,5,B00AW9M4FS,"If you are European, and didn't grow up in a religiously puritan society, you'll love this comedy. It flatly lays out what the earth is spinning around these days, and it makes a mockery of our current, deviated perception of relationships. There are several subtle layers to this comedy, some are more obvious, but the fundamental layer touches down into the problems of our society.

5510971,5,B00AW9M4FS,"To be honest, I would rate it at 4 stars but I have to try to offset all of the single stars so that this gem (in the rough, to be sure) does not go unnoticed. I rarely write reviews but, since their purpose is to provide descriptive commentary of a product (as well as personal opinions), I felt the need to do so here because I think that the description provided is not sufficient and will cause some viewers to be offended. That is to say, this movie is not for everyone. And, while the meager description may add to the shock value of the movie, it will likely only serve to decrease the movie's rating in an unfair (or undesired, at least) manner.

I think that the content this movie was created (or inspired) by some collection of actors who were losing their minds with the spoon-fed crapola that permeates the mainstream film industry and just wanted to loosen their collars a bit. It could (and maybe should, to be honest) be legitimately described as offensive, but not in an offending manner. This movie is obviously not for young ones.

This is a collection of short stories (sort of). Funny short stories. Funny short stories with uncommon subject matter. Thats all I have to say about that. I certainly wouldnt want to ruin it for you. To say that this movie is pointless and has only comedic value is an insult, regardless of the judge. Its message is not subtle but still might be hard to hear over the deafening roar of the material.

This isn't a movie for sissies. It is definitely a comedy and is awesomely funny.

However, if you consider yourself a spiritual person, you will hate it. If you consider yourself a mature person, you will hate it. If you consider yourself a person with sophistication, you will hate it. If you . . Well, you get the idea. If not, let me put it this way: if you take comfort by living in a secure and proper fashion, it is likely that this movie will reach down, bite you in the ass and use your face to smash down the boundaries of your sensibilities and it won't be pretty.

If you are the type of person I described above, please do yourself and others a favor and give this movie a pass (just look at all of the 1-star ratings). There is nothing wrong in you being who you are, but if you are as such and you watch this then you will likely feel the need to waste your (and others) time by writing a hateful rail against the villainous content of this film and your wasted money and your wasted two hours, etc. Dont go away mad, just go away. Youve been warned.

If you decide to take the plunge, just relax and let it do its thing. If you are uptight in the least then this film will own you.",1506643200,4,2651,4.292

5511020,5,B00AW9M4FS,"Honestly I have no idea why this movie gets such bad reviews from so many people.  Yes, it's stupid, stupid comedy but you know that going in - especially if you buy the DVD.  The skits are hilarious and a big part of the humor is the fact that they got this huge actors to do such crazy skits.  We've laughed so hard at this movie several times and I'm glad we own it because we've got a lot more laughs watching in the future coming our way.",1493596800,7,443,4.011363636363637
5511021,3,B00AW9M4FS,"Movie 43 is basically a skit show as a movie based around the fact that Denis Quaid's character is trying to sell his movie to a studio and coming up with each storyline, mostly at gunpoint since it's obvious no one would actually make this thing.  A lot of the skits are heavy on the crude humour, most you'll get a few laughs from, some aren't funny at all (the basketball room, the homeschooled one)  and some them you got over the joke before they moved onto something else (Hugh Jackman something hanging from his chin scene).  None are so brilliant that you'll be telling anyone you have to see this to see this scene, and reviewing this the next day I struggle to even remember some of them.  But some of the highlights for me was Justin Long as Robin (from 1966 TV era Batman and Robin) on a speed dating night when Batman (Jason Sudeikis) turns up and becomes an annoying third wheel ruining his chances with the ladies (also has Kristen Bell in it as Supergirl).  Chloe Moretz on a young teen come over to her boyfriend's house and make out for the first time who gets her period while sitting on the couch and the date and his older brother freak out and dial 911 where the operator laughs at them.  The Tampax commercial after this was so ridiculous it was hysterical.  As were some of the other commercials like raising awareness of kids in the machines, and the iBabe hazard.

But there's plenty of big stars in this one, besides those already mentioned there's Anna Farris, Emma Stone, Kate Bosworth,  Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Elizabeth Banks, Josh Duhamel, Richard Gere, amongst many others. It's worth watching once and it if it didn't have the big names it probably wouldn't have worked but it's not something you're likely to watch a second time.  Three and half stars.",1491782400,,1791,4.5514018691588785

It is a collection of set piece, unrelated, episodes of the most insanely funny stuff I have ever seen.  It has loads of very well known stars in comic bits of the hardest R rating.  The movie should be rated F for funny.  You will see stuff you would never imagine and laugh your butt off.
  If R rated humor puts you off, avoid watching this.  All of the bits involve situations and themes that will offend many people.  The rest of us are still laughing.",1475452800,2,611,3.9834710743801653

I didn't watch it on Amazon - I had rented it from Redbox and it was the worst piece of crap I ever had watched.  What does Amazon do when deciding to recommend movies?  See if you've watched a similar genre and then put movies of the genre with big names in it into a hat and pull them out randomly?  The recommendation was on my page only briefly, when I looked again, it was gone.
It's a wonder as to why they would have even dared to recommend a movie that many have described as the worst movie ever made.  Ratings from IMDb (2 of 5 stars),  Rotten Tomatoes (4%), and Metacritic (18%) are all very low.  Audience score for Rotten Tomatoes was only 24% of people who liked it.  This movie should never pop up on a 'recommended"" list for anyone, it is just that bad.  I am sure there are a few who liked it,  but the amount of people who did not is astronomical.  So why would Amazon take the chance?  I've started to watch a few bad movies on it,  but never finished them and none have even come near to being as much of a failure as Movie 43.",1469318400,,1139,4.058295964125561

I will admit that when I first saw it, the level of depravity on display distracted from the actually very funny stuff here. But after thinking of it later, I realized I wanted to watch it again, and then I really enjoyed it.
I was in a class for Broadcast TV Filming techniques, when the instructor showed us a commercial from Russia, to show the difference between what they could show on TV and what we Americans are allowed to see.  I laughed out loud, as the ""commercial"" he showed was actually a bit from this movie.

A mind-boggling list of Hollywood actors star in a series of loosely connected shorts joined together by The Pitch, in which Dennis Quaid plays an unpredictable lunatic aggressively trying to sell his awful script to embattled studio exec Greg Kinnear (easily the most relatable character in the film).

What did I think?

A class of illiterate orphans with four broken pencils, three sheets of paper and a reference copy of Das Kapital could write a funnier movie than this, and there would probably be fewer dick jokes. If you ever feel like your life has no purpose, now you know it does: to go and punch Peter Farrelly right in his stupid face.

 The one with Emma Stone at the checkout was hilarious. The guy who plays truth or dare with Halle Berry and the skit with Beezel the cat is the best. The whole bit where the guy pulls a gun and forces the guy to service the security guard twice. It's a mashup of mini shorts that are all funny as the last of not funnier. Great movie to make people watch to get laughs at a party smokeout or smoke with your girl or boyfriend and have a few good laughs. Heck of alot of excellent actors and actresses & comedians. The skit with Huge Jackman and Kate Winslet at the restaurant will have you in tears and that is just the first of like 10 short skits.

How could a movie like this see the light of day? I watched this on Netflix and I just couldn't handle it and stopped it 30 minutes early. Is this how Hollywood sees us? Do they not know that there are passionate film watchers like me out there? It just hurts me. The worst part is that I love comedies, but this, this is a dysfunctional movie. This did come out during the month of January though, so it makes sense why it's so terrible. Did you know that the promotional tag line ""What is Movie 43?""

5512794,3,B00AW9M4FS,"I'm a cranky 48-year-old who doesn't dig most recent attempts at absurd comedy. {For the record, I absolutely love ""Monty Python,"" SNL, and ""South Park,"" especially the early seasons.} I was in a particularly crabby mood when I started watching MOVIE 43 and almost stopped it after the early ""ballsy blind date"" skit, but something bade me to stay with it, and even though I wasn't all that satisfied, it cheered me up and even made me lol, something I don't often do, in a couple of spots.

There is some nice satire and parody here on a bunch of miscellaneous subjects: home schooling, computer dating sites, breast enlargement surgery, superheroes, after-school specials, you name it. The fact that there are so many Hollywood big-shots in parodies of their typical roles adds a great deal to this little batch of spoofs. There's a lot of gross humor, of course: Scat, mutilation, body parts, etc, but to my pleasant surprise, MOVIE 43 doesn't feel the need to just rub its audience's face in these elements, making its point without showing TOO much nauseating stuff. {Fans of nauseating stuff will definitely find some here, but they may be disappointed that it doesn't go farther.}

The biggest problem is that it's nowhere near as developed and focused as it could be, and virtually all the scenes, many of which would be worth entire films unto themselves, end just as they start to get interesting. But maybe that's the point because, as the young aspiring filmmakers in the central story attest, the biggest thing this film seems to be parodying is today's lazily produced low budget films (premature credits rolling at 76 minutes, etc).

Though it's far from great, there are definitely some things to appreciate here. MOVIE 43 is disorganized and underdone, but even in those respects, it still works (kind of). I think that 25 or so years ago, when I was more into humor for its own sake and less inclined to analyze everything to death, my verdict would have been the same.",1400198400,,1987,4.804093567251462

The Room is a bizarre film that is like a train wreck that makes it hard to look away... When Adult Swim shows it on April 1rst, it's hilarious due to the black bars that keep increasing in size.

While I tend to watch art-house, Indy & international films, I do enjoy the occasional goofy irreverent movie. Considering the premise of Movie43 & the cast, I assumed that it would be like Kentucky Fried Movie.

It isn't. It's more along the lines of a Seth McFarlane movie that is even worse, tasteless & disjointed even for the McFarlane franchise. Unfortunately, it's not funny, just boring & obnoxious. I rented it free from the library & stopped watching Movie43 after 20 minutes.  20 minutes I'll never get back.

5512799,5,B00AW9M4FS,"Maybe it's a generational thing, but at my age I still have a fondness for slapstick comedy. This film feeds that with the addition of wildly ""shocking"" story lines with the crudest of crude themes. That's what it's designed to do! Obviously, the producers never expected to win at Cannes or have the Academy envelope opened in their favor, but they do successfully target an audience willing and desirous of cutting the apron strings of convention, but not in the direction of zombie and action hero movies that swamp the circuit these days.

That said, ""Movie 43"" isn't funny throughout, like that other slapstick jewel, ""Airplane!"". But its few low spots have nothing to do with backing away from its reliance on grotesque themes, but rather some plotting and acting deficiencies. Those are few and far between, however, and overall I give this film three thumbs up! (How three, you ask? Well, if Hugh Jackman can have his balls hanging from his neck, what's so odd about having three thumbs?)",1398643200,,996,4.858823529411764

5512802,4,B00AW9M4FS,"First thing, I am NOT a fan of potty and profanity type humour. That's why this movie really suprised me. It's got a great cast and is suprisingly well directed. Yes, it's crude, very crude, with themes of the afore mentioned potty humour and profanity, as well as sex, violence, periods, and a whole bunch of other stuff. However, behind all that, it is actually well written in parts. My favourites being the sketch where the girl from Kick Ass (the main one) is around her boyfriends house and she tries to get away or at least hide the fact that she just had her first period. She then gets surrounded by various male characters (her boyfriend, boyfriend's older brother, boyfriend's dad and her dad) who haven't a clue what to do and try to help her in a sterotypically male way, which makes for some good laughs and highlights the sterotype of how males don't have a clue about periods. Another good one is the last one with Elizabeth Banks and the rivalry she has with her boyfriend's male cat, for the boyfriend's affections. The cat itself is a cartoon, quite literally. Sick and strange but still funny with a deliciously dark ending. The blind date one with Halle Berry and the co-writer of the British version of the Office (not Ricky Gervais) gets pretty crazy but still amusing as they get each other to do outlandish dares.

Overall, yes it's extreme and the gags and themes are crudely out there. If you get easily offended by anything I have mentioned, avoid this. If you like Jackass, Seth Mcfarlane stuff, Farrely Brothers (Peter Farrely- Something about Mary, co-made this), crude stand up comics and dark humour (like in Kick Ass), with a bit of Kevin Smith thrown in, think you'll like it. Yes, there are some bad sketches amongst the better ones and it would have been a better movie if it was a little less Seth Mcfarlane and more Kevin Smith, but it isn't. Still, it's good for a few laughs, and if like me, you generally don't like potty humour but enjoy gags that sterotype people, dark humour, satire, observational comedy and don't mind swearing, then give it a go, because some of the writing is defintitely clever. I think the level of grossness in this, clouds the fact that it does contain some clever writing, at least for the better sketches. I guess it is possible to be clever and disgusting. Just don't watch it with kids or easily offended people. Also, it's definitely a 'guys' type of movie and does sexualize women too much.",1397865600,,2466,4.617312072892939

Dennis Quaid is a crazed author of a series of skits (and commercials for some reason) he is pushing (forcefully) to Greg Kinnear, a film mogul. This is the thread that runs throughout the entire film as a base theme. I was bowled-over by the cast of this film. I didn't know much about it until I saw it, but I enjoyed much of it. There are definitely parts that fall flat or even a bit lower, but more than 1/2 the film is so outrageous and over-the-top that it's damn funny. The writers definitely went for the sicko concepts, most of which they couldn't get on TV today, despite Seth MacFarlane, the king of bizarre/offensive humor being in the film as himself.

Hugh Jackman on a blind date with a beautiful woman in a fancy restaurant has a normal-sized scrotum growing under his chin. The poor woman tries to be cool, but it's pretty hard. That was a funny sketch.

There's a sketch about what could happen if home schooling were taken to the extreme that's pretty funny.

The skit with Hali Berri is weird funny. She and her date do some unthinkable things to themselves when they engage in a serious game of Truth or Dare.

These three sketches along with some of the segments that return to Quaid's increasingly forceful (guns and gernade anyone?) attempts to sell his script are the highlights of the film for me.

The late ""Tony Soprano"" makes a cameo as a security guard Dennis Quaid had to ""blow"" (against the guard's will no less) to get on the movie lot in the first place.

The fake commercials and final sketch about a black basketball team afraid to play their first white opponents have a few chuckles but don't really work very well.

This film has been compared to ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" a disconnected string of comedy sketches done in, I believe, the early 1980s, but this film is MUCH more amusing than ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" which contains only about 10 minutes of really funny material.

If you have a really twisted sense of humor like I do, you'll enjoy this movie despite its shortcomings. It's crass, gross and is rarely ""tasteful"" in the least.

Instead of my usual listing of who is directing, writing and staring in it, I realize that it would take too much space and time to do so. I actually attempted to write a review of this.....thing I am supposed to call a film, but I thought it would be take too much time from actually writing my opinion on the film. So, to those who wish to know who had their involvement in this film, go to Wikipedia, IMDB or any similar website that provides film information. As for the film itself.....where, oh where to begin?

Movie 43 began its small, pitiful life as an idea from one of its producers, Charles B. Wessler. Wessler's work is more well known as a right hand man of sorts to the Farrelly Brothers, the one-hit wonders behind such works such as There's Something About Marry and Kingpin. It was to be an all ensemble cast of the funniest minds in Hollywood of writers, directors, actors and actresses, all being incredibly silly and funny. The project kept on going through all sorts of development troubles, with it being constantly started up, then stopped and so on and so forth. Eventually, the film was able to finally see the light of day in early 2013, released during a time when pretty much nothing is coming out (e.g. January) and how did the film do? Well, it made money (29 million world wide on a 6 million dollar budget), but as evidenced by films like Transformers Revenge of The Fallen and The Devil Inside, just because it made money doesn't mean its good.

Thanks to Movie 43, we can now say that films with all star casts are no long a surefire thing that the film is of any excellent quality. Now, to summarize the plot of Movie 43 can be somewhat of an exercise in futility, but I shall do the best I can. There are two different versions of the film that exist, with a different segment that ties all of these together, so I shall go with the one I had seen. Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid) is attempting to greenlight multiple script ideas to film producer Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinneer). Wessler even resorts to threatening others at gun point to get his ideas off the ground. The film shows us Wessler's harebrained ideas on screen which include the following:

- A segment in which Kate Winslet goes a on a blind date with Hugh Jackman who has a pair of testicles on his neck.

- Two parents, played by actual couple Liev Screiber and Naomi Watts, decide to homeschool their son, played by Jeremy Allen White, while also putting him through all the humiliating things a kid might experience during high school.

- Johnny Knoxville decides to get his best friend, played by Sean William Scott, a Leprechaun played by Gerard Butler for his birthday in an attempt to get his gold. Gratuitous violence and swearing ensues.

- Justin Long plays Robin from the DC Comics, who goes on speed dating with the help of Batman, played by Jason Sudeikis.

- Anna Faris is going on a date with Chris Pratt and to celebrate their relationship, she wants Pratt to s***
 on her. Pratt's character then eats a grotesque amount of stomach rupturing food to do so.

And so on and so forth.

Now, I have seen some utterly revolting works in my time, both in the positive sense and negative. Stuff that most mainstream audiences would shun away from that select audiences and I would get massive enjoyment from. On the positive sense, I've sat through the works of directors like Lars von Trier, Takashi Miike, Park Chain Wook, Darren Aronofsky - Directors who push the boundaries of filmmaking that can both make the audience cringe to hell and back while challenging the way think and see film. On the negative sense, I've sat through the bottom of the barrel when it comes to filmmaking such as the works of Jason Friedberg And Aaron Seltzer, some of the works from Michael Bay and Uwe Boll. But even all of those filmmakers I just listed, even the bad ones, would be possibly terrified by what has been put on display here.

The film apparently runs 94 minutes over here in the States, but what  should have felt like a quick and painless routine became more or less an eternity, like being thrown into a black hole that traveled at an incredibly slow rate whilst taking a lot of psychoactive drugs. Every single segment that would constantly be thrown at me wasn't in singular sense funny, amusing, creative or even off the track. Instead, they were lazy, stupid, unfunny, poorly paced, insulting and any and every single word from any kind of dictionary, whether it'd be in English or whatever kind of foreign language out there.

 All of the film's participants make absolute fools of themselves in this film and not in a funny way. For example, the aforementioned part when Wolverine has balls on his neck? The entire gag comes off as someone going like ""TEE HEE HEE HEE! LOOK! HE'S GOT BALLS ON HIS NECK! NO ONE ISN'T NOTICING IT EXCEPT FOR HIS DATE! HIS PUBES JUST DROPPED INTO HIS SOUP! ISN'T THAT FUNNY?"" Yeah, it'd be funny if there was more jokes surrounding it outside of an insipid gag that goes on for far too long. There's also the ""Poop"" segment I mentioned, in which when it hits its gastric crescendo, has this utterly ugly and mean spirited vibe to it. You feel absolutely dirty watching the damn thing.

Hell, even from the stills or watching a trailer, you can tell that this film was cheap to make. Everything has this slightly icky feel to them when watching, like the camera they were using was something you'd get at a cheap ass garage sale than a Hollywood production. I have seen films that cost less that what Movie 43 did that look much more polished and have more effort in them than what this Hollywood infested pierce of garbage looks like. A film like Moon, which costed 1 million less than this, has utterly stunning effects, set and costume design and a bunch creativity behind it. This, on the other hand, does not have ANY of these qualities what so ever!

For those who will probably say to me that I don't ""Have a sense of humor"" or ""Not every film is 2001"", allow me to say this in response: For starters, I never bothered to watch the rest of 2001. I liked what I saw, but I never bothered to get around to it. Secondly, I have enjoyed really dumb comedies before. The Razzie Award winning Freddy Got Fingered, co-written, directed and starring Tom Green, is utterly repulsive by regular standards but I find it to be quite creative and strangely amusing. There is some genuine creativity behind the film, such as the film infamous ""Daddy Would You Like Some Sausage"" part, in which Tom Green constructs a system to play the piano while eating Sausages tied up on a series of strings. But there isn't a scene in Movie 43 that made me feel this way.

Admittedly, I do have a degree of sympathy for those who participated in the film. Apparently, a lot of the cast was just pretty much suckered into the picture, guilt tripped or outright manipulated by the film's producers. For example, Richard Gere did not want to be in his sketch in which he runs an Apple-like corporation that sells i-pods in the shape of fully grown naked Women. He said he couldn't come to the set, so the filmmakers brought the set to him. Other actors and directors also got a chance to get out of this mess, such as Sam Rockwell, who choose Seven Psychopaths over this or George Clooney, who pretty much told them ""No f***ing way"".

I'm not the kind of person who goes out of their to insult others because of their taste in film or anything in terms of art or media. It is a pet peeve of mine, ever since I saw Bob ""Moviebob"" Chipman from The Escapist act like a childish brat over people seeing The Expendables over Scott Pilgrim vs The World. It's not a good character trait and can make you look like an ass. But, as much as I hate saying this and I will not take back what I have said, I must confess: If you think films like Man of Steel, Star Trek Into Darkness or any other big-budget, over-the top, over produced blockbuster is the worse thing you've seen this year without haven't seen this or some kind of insult to cinema, I only have one thing to say:

You have no spine. You wouldn't know a bad movie if it came along and presented itself in all of its vacuous glory. You should be lucky to watch anything instead of this. Movie 43 is the epitome of utterly vacuous, disgusting and tasteless filmmaking. It is the worst film of this year, the worst film of this young decade so far and easily one of the worst films ever conceived by the Hollywood system.

This movie is in fact a mash up of a bunch of different segments/skits. Think Saturday Night Live: The Movie. It's aims to be a silly outlandish comedy and it succeeds.

The most impressive part ""Movie 43"" is the casting. The film boasts an outstanding cast of stars including: Kristen Bell, Halle Berry, Kate Bosworth, Kieran Culkin, Josh Duhamel, Anna Faris (with her real-life husband Chris Pratt), Terrence Howard, Hugh Jackman, Johnny Knoxville, Justin Long, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chlo Grace Moretz, Richard Gere, Jason Sudeikis, Liev Schreiber (with his real-life partner Naomi Watts), Seann William Scott, Emma Stone, Uma Thurman, Patrick Warburton and Kate Winslet! Plus, Greg Kinnear, Seth MacFarlane and Dennis Quaid (only in American version)! Oh, and I almost forgot Gerard Butler as leprechaun.

""Movie 43"" is a series of loosely connected comedy skits in the vein of very influential comedy ""The Kentucky Fried Movie,"" with each segment directed by such people as Elizabeth Banks (who also appears), Steven Brill, Griffin Dunne, Peter Farrelly, James Gunn and Brett Ratner.

You may laugh a few times or perhaps more, but as a whole the film is just a mess. The sporadically funny film's only selling point is that these talented stars are doing jokes that are most inappropriate. Actually, that those jokes are mostly crude, sexual, scatological, and offensive does not matter. The problem with the film is that they come up with a silly joke and stretches it too far.

""Movie 43"" sets out to be a raunchy, gross-out comedy with A-list actors, but quickly becomes tiresome because of sloppy direction and one-joke ideas that go nowhere.",1376179200,,1733,5.200716845878136

Actors and producers are constantly having to filter through bad writing, which must be frustrating  The film shows that no matter how good an actor is, no matter how great the performance, if its a bad script the final product will be ridiculous-which the movie is, but in a funny way.

We see that all the member of the production company dutifully took time to post 5 star reviews but they are out numbered by 1 star reviews by about 3 to 1. Rarely are products so poorly rated.

These unconnected skits are each based on a joke, a premise, that is barely funny and then the bit goes on for way agonizing minutes--it's like a blue version of Saturday Night Live at its very worst.

This first skit's premise is rip of a joke from the animated TV show ""South Park"" but done without the context, story, and characterizations -- whatever you think of South Park, this is a hundred times less funny. Plus the skit goes on for many minutes. The first skit's joke is basically ""I can't stop staring at his mole"" but a blue version. What possibly might have worked in some contexts for couple of seconds as a throwaway joke is worse than boring stretched over a skit of several minutes. And then the movie continued with one such bad poorly written, poorly timed skit after another.

Did the writers and cast think this was ""edgy""? Did they have a bet that they could have the script written by lobotomized monkeys and still get people to watch? Were the producers double or triple dog dared to make the most offensive film ever to see if a big name cast could still sell it? Well, judging from the number of people, including me, who fell for it, that may have been the strategy. I guess that's why they didn't let the critics see it first. Thank goodness I watched it on Amazon and didn't pay for a theater ticket.

I realize that humor is largely in the mind of the beholder. South Park, Team America, Amazon Women on the Moon, anything featuring Sacha Baron Cohen - I find them all pretty funny and even clever in spots in spite of their utter tastelessness and the fact that I also find parts of them offensive. But Movie 43 has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It isn't even mildly amusing, unless you're stuck at the mental age where anything dealing with poop and/or genitalia is automatically hilarious. And if you're really at that age, your parents shouldn't have this movie in the house.

5514970,1,B00AW9M4FS,"I'm not quite sure how they pulled it off, but the makers of ""Movie 43"" have somehow managed to rope some of the biggest names in Hollywood (their identities will be withheld to protect the guilty) into appearing in a comedy that hits a new low in witlessness, offensiveness and tastelessness. Did none of these fine actors read the script - or at least have agents to do it for them and thus warn them off the project? As it is, I suspect most of these performers will be working overtime trying to expunge this jaw-droppingly awful cinematic turkey from their resumes. I can only imagine that a goodly number of people in Hollywood must have lost careers and jobs over this one.

The movie is really just a series of blackout sketches (a la ""Saturday Night Live""), all written and directed by different artists, held together by the flimsiest of narrative devices: Dennis Quaid plays a gun-wielding, mentally unbalanced screenwriter who invades the office of a studio exec (Greg Kinnear) and proceeds to pitch an idea for a movie that he's convinced will be a bona fide box office bonanza. The labored segments cover such topics as genitalia, scatology, incest - you name it, it's in there. Look, I like dirty jokes and gross-out humor as much as the next fella', but when each attempt lands with a resounding thud, all that's left is the gross-out and the dirty - and you'll probably feel the need for a shower after it's over.

5515012,1,B00AW9M4FS,"""Movie 43"" looked so promising, with a massive star-filled cast; I was hoping for an updated ""Kentucky Fried Movie.""  It ended up more of a turkey, unfortunately.  I knew that the movie had received terrible ratings, but as a huge fan of Kate Winslet (as well as a few of the other stars, including Naomi, Watts, Emma Stone, Chris Pratt, and Kieran Culkin), I still had to see this movie.

The movie is divided into 10 skits, 3 commercials, and a wrap-around skit that tries to tie everything together.  The wrap-around stars Greg Kinnear as a movie executive and Dennis Quaid (who looks extremely leathery here) as a producer trying to pitch picture ideas.  The ""ideas"" are the skits, although most of them make no sense as actual movies, and how the commercials fit into this concept is never explained.  A few of the skits elicit chuckles; however, most of them completely bomb and/or are jaw-droppingly raunchy.  I have nothing against raunchiness, but it has to be funny.

The movie starts off fine with the first skit, featuring Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman on a blind date.  Kate cannot figure out why the dazzling Hugh is still single, until he reveals a bizarre disfigurement.  Apparently, this skit was the first one made and subsequently was used to entice other stars to join in the picture.  If they had continued at this level of quality then the movie may have been a 3-star affair, but it quickly devolves with the scatologically-obsessed ""The Proposition,"" which stars real-life couple Anna Farris and Chris Pratt.  They are two of the most likeable stars out there, and the skit does have a few funny lines, but like so many of the other sketches it quickly overstays its welcome and becomes simply disgusting.  The same thing applies to the appalling animated section, ""Beezel,"" about an obscenely disturbing cat.

Despite the negative reviews, many people are likely to be curious about this movie and want to see one of their favorite stars.  I too got suckered into seeing this exceptionally bad movie.  Fortunately, it's short and the brevity of most of the skits make it go by quickly.",1374710400,,2110,4.803324099722992

I know this is supposed to be some kind of spoof comedy movie, but this is a disgrace on comedy or spoofs. Why in the world would anybody have given these obviously hack ameture writters and producers the chance to do a movie like this. I truly felt disgusted and wanted to break some thing after watching this waste of time rag trash. I have never been so awfully irritated after watching a movie like I did this one.

I have no issues with things that cross the lines and present it in a way that makes you laugh, but this movie does none of that.  A nonsensical script that puts good actors and actresses in situations that they cant even save and make funny.

Seems promising, but then....

Well, I wasn't high when ""43"" ran on my laptop PC and I do have my standards. Yes there's parts that made me cringe, but I definitely laughed at others, so I'm right in the middle on it.

I'm just not sure how they blackmailed them to be in this movie and do what they did; otherwise appearing in something like this would be a potential career killer for an actor.

Probably worth a rent if you enjoy this kind of humor.  3 stars because some of the shorts in here aren't that funny (to me); and the fact that this probably shouldn't be compiled into a movie you pay money for.

I seriously do not know how so many legitimate actors and actresses were roped into this travesty. Here is the only plausible theory that me, 43 NASA scientists, and a supercomputer came up with:

Hugh Jackman's house was invaded, and his family was held at gunpoint to force him to do the film. Liev Schrieber, Naomi Watts, and Kate Winslet were sent fake scripts, and held hostage at gunpoint to prevent them from escaping from the film set. Emma Stone, Gerard Butler, and Chloe Grace Moretz were heavily drugged. Dennis Quaid was under hypnotic influence, as was Uma Thurman. Halle Berry was told to do the film or they would make a sequel to Catwoman. Faced with an impossible choice, she did what anyone would do. Movie 43 makes Catwoman look like The Dark Knight. Christopher Mintze-Plasse, Anna Faris, and Terrence Howard were blackmailed.

That is all I can come up with. This trash has no redeeming factors. None at all.
It is unfunny, stupid, filthy, disgusting, perverted garbage.

On behalf of the many unfortunate souls who did not know what they were getting into when they saw this movie (if it can even be called that), I say this:

DO NOT. WATCH. IT.

As for my rating for this film, imagine the lowest, smallest number you can, multiply that by 6, take that number down 14 notches, and times that by 43. You are now half way to the number that I rate this film.

5515610,3,B00AW9M4FS,"Okay, here's where things get really weird; I actually, sort of, liked MOVIE 43.  At least, the ""version"" I saw.  If you've seen 'Kentucky Fried Movie', and liked it, this is a hyped-up, jacked-on-crack, 2013 version of the same film - or, more accurately, a series of short (sometimes very short), interconnected and usually unrelated short films, with a wraparound story interspersed in between them to try and hold the ""storyline"" (of which there really isn't one) together.

For the American release, the wraparound story is ""The Pitch"", where a down-and-out film producer (Dennis Quaid) tries to pitch his crazy-assed movie idea to a studio head (Greg Kinnear).  This is NOT the version I saw (from what I've read, I caught the version that was released internationally), and I'm sort of glad because the wraparound story on the version I saw - about three geeks, two of whom trick the third into looking for the mysterious (even deadly) 'Movie 43' online - was fairly hilarious, and seemed to fit the idea of why there were a bunch of short films looped together in a more logical way.

The shorts themselves, good GOD what a cast!  Throughout the film you will see no less than Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt, Kieran Culkin, Emma Stone, Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Justin Long, Uma Thurman, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Bell, Bobby Cannavale, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloe Grace Moretz, Gerard Butler, Seann William Scott, Terrence Howard and others doing and saying things you may NEVER have thought you'd see on film!  Indeed, if you gross out easily or are easily offended, this for sure is NOT the film for you.  Conversely, if you have an open mind and a sense of humor that sometimes lends to the bizarre, some of the shorts in this film are laugh-out-loud funny, and worth wading through some of the lamer segments to get to.  Not everything works here, by any means, but enough does to make it worth watching.  Just be forewarned - the humor here is VERY adult (in content; in maturity level it sometimes sinks to ""neanderthal"" for sure), and VERY bizarre.  But again, even as you gasp at some of the more shocking moments, you may also find yourself laughing like hell over some of them.",1372896000,,2264,4.8242894056847545

It is composed of short skits laced together under the theme of a movie pitch to a studio. The skits are not funny. Check out the Wikipedia entry to read the overviews of each segment. Comedic timing is non-existent. Punchlines are lacking in quality or never executed.

If there are any redeeming qualities to this film, then I don't see them. Movie 43 would not even make it to or be included in the ""it is so bad, it is good"" category. A bad acid trip or men/women gone wild. This is nothing more than a disgusting, offensive, and poorly edited movie.",1371168000,4,647,4.684210526315789

5516485,2,B00AW9M4FS,"The film ""Movie 43"" was honestly one of the most over hyped, over produced, worthless films that I have ever seen. The plot line is all over the place, and it seems as if the script was written by a 12 year old. The only entertaining portion involved ""speed dating"", and even then that segment like all others in the film dragged out for far too long. I had never considered walking out of a theater after paying until I saw this film. It was not worth my money in the theaters, and I would never suggest this to someone unless they were only paying 99 cents and were bedridden due illness or surgery. Final Grade: D-

For those that are familiar with the Jamie Kennedy documentary titled ""heckler"", I would incredibly enjoy to have the opportunity he gave to an online critic. To get the chance to sit down with any number of the actors in this film and let them know that staplers are funnier than they were.

I read one review that said the ""only"" funny part of the movie was a part that neither my husband or I laughed at. Humor is relative, and I know that my husband and I giggled, at the minimum, for MOST of this movie. There were two or three skits that weren't all that funny, but I didn't leave the movie thinking it was the worst movie ever - which is what some of these reviews say. Lots of dick and fart jokes... this is not intellectual humor, or even dark humor. It's slapstick and dumb, but that's funny to some people.

Somehow they managed to use a variety of stars who not only make a tedious, boring and uninteresting movie, but one that is not even bad enough to see just out of curiosity.

I laughed once. Briefly. At a fake commercial claiming vending machines had crying children inside them. This faint glimmer of humor was quickly overwhelmed by the depression brought on by the movie not ending.

Imagine a variety of stars reading lines they hope will shock you into laughing. The shock is lame and any other reason to laugh is absent. You don't even feel sorry for the actors, who seem sincere in their desire to make a good movie, but come off as having no sense of humor whatsoever.

One of the first sketches involves Hugh Jackman having a scrotum hanging from his neck.  It only gets worse from there.  Need I say more?,1362355200,12,290,4.181818181818182
5516880,3,B00AW9M4FS,"This is the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" or ""Groove Tube"" for this generation. Normally this type of crude humor is done by unknowns looking to start a career and not by Hollywood's elite looking to end their career. There are numerous skits, most of which concern sex in one way or another. Some are cruder than others, some are out right funny while others you might find disgusting.

If you are turned off by crude humor, you should avoid this film. However, if you love the crude humor of modern films, this one will keep you in stitches.
