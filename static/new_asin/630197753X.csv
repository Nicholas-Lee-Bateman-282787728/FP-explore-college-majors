403371,3,630197753X,"SCREEN FORMAT
Modified to fit your screen
Uh-oh. So why did I get the idea that MGM would  put any kind of effort into the release of a properly restored version of this fine classic? ""NIMH"" has never received  the recognition it deserved. When it first came out in the theater many  many years ago, E.T. was  released simultaneously and blew it right out of  the water.  I won't go into details here why I find this --cartoon--  special and worthwhile, but in short I would lave loved to see a nice  letterboxed version.
So what did MGM give us?
Welp, the box is nice  enough if a little garish -- the  front is a reissue of the poster as used  on the VHS cassette. The back has a big red box that explains that  the  movie has been modified to fit a 4:3 screen, which sucks. (The laserdisc  jacket was much nicer)
Inside there's a leaflet with chapter titles,  voice cast names, a few nicely restored promotional pictures and a -very-  brief review of the making of the cartoon.
The disc itself is printed  with a color graphic on one side.
So like it says on the box, Experience  MGM DVD!
There's a short menu where you can pick language (English,  duh)  and subtitles (English / Spanish), play the trailer (which I had never  seen), access chapters and start the feature. Pretty nice, even if the  colors on the screened-in artwork in the background of the menu are a  little off.
The sound is plain dolby surround, and plays just fine, with  no audible form of distortion.
The movie transfer itself, however, is a  little disappointing.  The only frame provided is 4:3. And they did not  appear to have used the same video master  that they built the laserdisc  from back then... instead,  the telecine transfer is from a scratched print  with  faded colors...  I think MGM could have done better than this poor  release. The Laserdisc and VHS versions actually LOOKS better.
But for  animation-buffs, I guess the disc  is worth it, just for the fact that you  can  freeze frame and analyze the wonderful and subtle animation that came  out of the Bluth studios back then. (The laserdisc version was CLV, which  on analog players precluded freeze frame analysis.)",911260800,12,2168,4.5732984293193715

I watched this as a kid and again as a teen and now as an adult... it still captivates me. It will open imagination in your child's mind, yet frighten them a bit, but in a good way that will have them pondering and exercising the mind's creative imagination. Its great to have a beautiful quality print, but this Blu-ray is still lacking and deserves a better release. I give the disc and presentation a 3, I really dislike this misleading cover art, the original poster is a magnificent illustration and I'm sure true fans would prefer it over the current candy-coated cover.

403478,5,630197753X,"I haven't watched this movie since I was a little kid even though it left a big impact on me then. I just decided to watch it again as an adult and it's honestly even better than I remember! Don Bluth's animation is absolutely gorgeous and I feel like if you were to take any still shot of this movie and make it a museum exhibit, it would be a work of art. There's a great sense of detail in the backgrounds and just the colorful expressions of the characters alone are worth the price of admission. The story is simple enough for kids to follow, yet layered with complex, dark themes and elements that will draw adults toward it and possibly appreciate it even more as a film. Jerry Goldsmith's score is wonderful and reminds me a lot of Igor Stravinsky in parts, and perhaps a little of John Williams as well. The voice acting from the whole cast is phenomenal with Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) in particular seamlessly switching into a pitch-perfect role of the mystical Nicodemus. I believe this movie is a masterpiece and should be watched by families everywhere if they can handle a little violent imagery here and there.",1505433600,3,1126,4.5245098039215685

Package came in perfect shape. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is the quality. Quality I observed in the movie looked very odd, I don't know if they really did a HD upscale, but it seem like not.

They added violence and silliness, made Nicodemus to be some kind of creepy wizard-type, made Jenner a horrible villain, and included magic, to name a few infractions. There was so much added that could have been left out, thereby leaving more room for the authentic story, which is so good I never get tired of it, even now in the midst of reading it to my 5th child for the second time.

403801,3,630197753X,"In reviewing this film, I have to make a big distinction between the animating accomplishment it represented, and the decisions the filmmakers made about the story. If you have NOT read ""Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,"" then I have two things to say: 1. You might enjoy this film, but 2. if you have a choice, read the book. The essential plotline is preserved, but the studio chose to overlay it with magic and to give the rats a quasi-Medieval court flair, complete with a snarling villain and his henchman, that really makes absolutely no sense. It's never explained, it's not even connected to their experiences in NIMH, and it's a clumsy and unnecessary ""solution"" to the conflict. Said conflict is also introduced to the film in order to heighten the danger, but although it comes across as darker, it speaks to a lack of faith in the audience understanding the danger and risk in the situation as portrayed in the book. This is not merely the problem of translation from a written to a visual medium--it's a series of changes to the very fabric of the original story, and not necessarily understanding where the ""meat"" of the interest was. Visually, however, the film featured some groundbreaking technique (at the time), and remains a beautiful relic of an era of animation when competition drove the art form to new heights. There's nothing wrong with the voice performances, and the song is nice; the fault lies in the script they were given to perform.",1477785600,3,1464,4.745098039215686

Even my non-cartoon enthusiast Father went along since it was advertised the most advanced and visually stunning picture that animation had to offer. The result was that it made me a Don Bluth loyalist for life; it made me Pumped up at the dawn of the new millennium when I was 25 years old to see Titan AE, and I  still chuckle over all my quarters that were thrown away in the laser disc arcade fountain of wasted youth [ also known as ] ""Dragon's Lair"" I swear - that machine straight- up picked kid's pockets over in the mall's corridor for a short time after NIMH. But it too was the most advanced and visually stunning Arcade game of it's time, (when it wasn't self immolating and overheating)

It holds up to the test of time and age.  I have noticed that as an adult many of the television shows and some of the children oriented movies I watched and enjoyed as a kid were really badly written.  With the Secret of NIMH that did not change.  The Animation was some of the best for a studio that didn't yet have computers.  The story was interesting and well played.

404380,1,630197753X,"well, for four year olds, i suppose this passes as entertainment. most awful animated feature i have ever seen. i love Disney, and many Pixar efforts, but this is just pathetic. no character development/plot other than ""clumsy crow possibly gets laid"", and ""humble mouse has everything scripted for her"". Watch ""The Triplets of Belleville"" if you want to see/hear what animation can do.",1473292800,,386,5.142857142857143
404381,5,630197753X,"I do own the DVD for this movie, though it was purchased off-Amazon.

Don Bluth in his prime right here, ladies and gentlemen. If you like fuzzy animals, adventure, heroic heroines, mystery, magic, science, and perhaps even a little faith, this is the movie for you. The animation is gorgeous and makes me yearn for the days of hand-drawn animation. The characters are great an unforgettable - heck even Jeremy the Crow manages to not get too annoying - and the music is spot-on and great, lending itself to the atmosphere and drawing viewers in. The plot flows great and no moment feels wasted. This is a textbook example of a classic animated movie with animals. Maybe a few scary moments for the younger children, but a good one nontheless.

The movie itself concerns the widowed mouse Mrs. Brisby, who has to move her children out of their house out in the farmfields before Farmer Fitzgibbons plows for the season. When the Farmer begins plowing early she and a neighbor, Auntie Shrew, are able to disable the tractor, but Brisby's hand is forced and she is told to see the Great Owl, who directs her towards the secretive Rats of NIMH and their leader, Nicodemus.

Perhaps one of the better aspects of this movie is the protagonist, Mrs. Brisby. She's a small mouse who has to overcome various obstacles, and she knows she's in over her head but presses on for the sake of her children. She doesn't use any weapons or kill anything, but it's her immense courage, wit, and love that aids her in overcoming challenges. She's such a great character and it's a shame that in this day and age where folks are rattling about how we need better female characters. Look to the classics, friends, you just might find some.

If I had to give it a rating, with 5 being average, I'd go for a Perfect 10. It's seriously that good and that captivating. Whether you watch it via Prime Video, or purchase it digitally or physically, if you love animation you have to watch this movie. It's one of the greats.",1473292800,,1998,4.588235294117647

Simply gorgeous and a near perfect story line, I still watch it today in awe much as I did as a 6 year old in the theater. The Great Owl is still one of the creepiest oracles in all of film history, and I love him.

One of the true family classics. Forget the bright feel good magic of movies like Cars (admittedly one of Pixar's few weak spots), lets delve into magic and poetry and the idea that the everywoman or everymouse (yes, a female lead with power, grace, and fragility all the same) can become the hero after all those who would be scripted as such have failed.

404483,5,630197753X,"Just watched The Secret of NIMH. So many tears. Consummate fantasy. Premium wonder. There is nothing like it. The greatest fantasy stories, no matter the sub-genre, depict characters and a world struggling under the weight of an alien machine - magic, gods, and all of them forbidding. Beings of fathomless power. Swords must shake in hands, fear must be real. Character drama can take a back seat to the drama of human myth, our collective terror at the dark, for we DO NOT HAVE all of the answers and never will.
Even the most cynical and scientific among us must admit that there are lost spaces containing things we cannot know, for to be human and to seek understanding of reality is like trying to jump to the moon. At the heart of fantasy and the red, beating, bloody heart of Us there is that audacious and stupid hope that our belief makes it all real, and that we are not simply tortured molecules in the rotting body of the Cosmos.
I choose to believe that someday we will jump that high. Even if it is only in death and dreams. I choose to believe that the speed of thought is faster than anything else, and when we die our fondest wishes and deepest fears take eternal root and bring us around and around and around again.
Believe what you want, but make it good. Believe in something, believe in anything. Believe in nothing and it all falls apart. Materialism in every sense of the word is the greatest evil of all - and it is embodied in every classic fantasy villain. Greed, a lust for fleeting and earthly things. If there are gods, then they are just as scared as we are, or they are simply insane, or unknowable, or any combination of the three.",1463616000,11,1665,4.444444444444445

404574,3,630197753X,"1982 saw the release of this somewhat complicated and largely forgotten animated film, although in its day it was certainly a cut above the rest in terms of technology.  This story involved many complicated characters and story line which was a more adult story given a childlike spin.  Kids and adults alike were a bit taken aback by it, there were few if any characters that kids could identify with, and since this was the summer/year of E.T., most movies of any kind fell behind its monster success.

Mrs. Brisby is a timid widow mouse living in Farmer Fitzgibbons's field with her three children planning to move out for plowing season only to have her youngest child fall ill.  Her neighbor, Mr. Ages, has diagnosed Timmy with pneumonia and says he must remain inside for three weeks or he will surely die.  The farmer, however, has decided to start plowing early and while her other neighbor, Auntie Shrew, helped disable the plow, Mrs. Brisby must find another way.  After meeting a klutzy crow, Jeremy, Mrs. Brisby goes upon his suggestion to see The Great Owl, who no one among their mouse community has ever seen and lived to tell of the tale (because he eats them obviously).  When she identifies herself as Mrs. Jonathan Brisby, he tells her to go to the rose bush and seek out the rats of NIMH and they will help her.  Following his advice, she goes to the rats and is astounded to see that they have electricity and technology and they are more than eager to help her once she identifies herself as being the widow of her late husband.  She meets Nicodemos, their wise and sage leader, as well as the captain of the guard, Justin, and the cunning, evil Jenner.  She learns that they are so eager to help her because her late husband, who was killed by the farmer's cat, Dragon, was a great friend to them who helped free them from NIMH, the National Institute of Mental Health, who had kidnapped and subjected all of them to horrible experiments (giving them intelligence).  Nicodemos gives Mrs. Brisby The Stone, an amulet that will give the wearer magic powers when worn by a courageous person.  Mrs. Brisby also agrees to help in the moving of her house to the lee of the stone (far enough away from the plowing) by sneaking into the farmhouse to drug the farmer's cat, Dragon, so that he will not interfere with their secret moving with ropes and pullies.  She is, however, caught by the farmer's son, and kept in a cage.  During the night, she hears the farmer talking on the phone about having the rose bush destroyed by NIMH to collect the rats once again.  In a planned accident, Jenner cuts the ropes and crushes Nicodemos under the weight of the Brisby home, then he and Justin get into a final clash, with his reluctant accomplis, Sullivan, delivering the death blow.  Once the house is, down, however, the Brisby home begins to sink into the mud.  Unable to pull it up, the house sinks.  The magic Stone, however, provides for the house to be moved by magic to a safe distance from the plow as planned.  Justin becomes the new leader of the rats, and takes them to safety away from the rose bush to live peacefully in Thorn Valley.

This movie was rather complicated, in that there were many characters, story moves and a rather complicated story that kids had a difficult time following.  The message, naturally, is to have courage.  Mrs. Brisby stops being the fearful and rises to the occasion to become the hero of the story by not letting her fears stop her.  I wish it was so easy for all, because as we know as adults, there are cowards around so many corners and so many things that we miss out on because someone will not take the lead. Probably the best character in the story is that of Jeremy the Crow, voiced by Dom Deluise, who brought a lot of himself into it.",1443225600,,3802,4.526315789473684

404581,4,630197753X,"Being a fan and lover of animation, I've always had an appreciation for director Don Bluth's work, and many of his movies have been a part of my childhood, especially ""An American Tail"" and ""The Land Before Time"".  But one of his most infamous works, ""The Secret of NIMH"", for some odd reason, always eluded me. While I was always aware of it by name, it wasn't until an internet movie reviewer called The Nostalgia Critic sighted it as one of his favorite films that I finally decided to hunt the movie down and give it a look. Along with other friends and family raving to me about how good it was, I figured now was as good a time as any to see just what all the hullabaloo was about. And I wasn't disappointed.

Based upon a children's novel, the movie tells the story of Mrs. Brisby--a field mouse who lives in a cinderblock with her children in a field on a farmer's plot of land. When plowing time approaches, she must devise a plan to move her family out of the field. To complicate matters, one of her children has fallen gravely ill, and is physically incapable of making the move. After befriending a clumsy crow named Jeremy, she's taken to visit a wise old owl, who instructs her to seek help from a group of rats who live below a rose bush on the farm. From there, Mrs. Brisby must gather all her strength and courage to face her fears and save her family...and in the process, uncovers the mystery behind her late husband's disappearance, and a secret that could change the lives of everyone forever.

In a weird way, I'm kind of glad I saw this later as an adult, as I have no doubt that the underlying themes and morals presented here would've flew over my head as a kid. But this isn't a criticism--merely an observation, for this is one animated movie that's just as much for adults as it is for kids. (I hate it when people hear the word ""cartoon"" and immediately think ""only for children"".) The rats of NIMH, who were genetically altered through scientific experiments, have arguably become just as intelligent as humans, and both they and the audience are left with the question of what is the morally right choice for them. Should they stay where they are and keep stealing electricity from the humans? Or should they strike out on their own and build their own civilization?

While these are questions with no clean cut answers, their destiny lies with Mrs. Brisby, who's one of the best female main characters I've ever come across. She's instantly likeable and relatable, and she can get understandably frightened or frustrated, but never to a point where it becomes annoying. ""Strong"" doesn't always mean ""stoic, bad ass fighter"". All she really wants is to save her family, and it's through her undying bravery that the other characters learn that understanding and love is the key to solving their problem. One may argue that the magic stone that comes into play was a bit of a ""deux ex machina"", but like any fairytale, it serves as a representation of Mrs. Brisby finding her inner strength and courage she never knew she had.

On the subject of the other characters, all of them are either loveable, interesting, or appropriately villainous. Jeremy, the crow, is especially memorable, and Dom DeLuise's performance just adds to his comedy relief. Admittedly, I was always kind of anxious to get through his scenes so we could get back to the story about the rats, but it's a minor complaint, and I understand that you need a bit of a break to balance out all the dark elements.

And dark is definitely the word to use here in describing this film. While the stuff with the animals is cute, the themes of science, nature, and the unknown all working together for survival is enough to make even adults have to stop and really think about what they've just watched. And this movie isn't afraid to depict gruesome scenes of torture, blood, death, and the occasional swear word. It really surprised me the DVD put this at a ""G"" rating. Maybe back in the 80s this was passable, but now a days, I'd rate this at a ""PG"".

In any case, I'm glad I took the time to hunt this movie down, as it truly is one of Don Bluth's finest works--one that's severely underrated and deserves more attention for it's incredible and lovely traditional animation. I'd recommend this for ages 10 and up, due to depictions of blood, violence, and a set of lessons that might only be understood and appreciated by an older audience.",1440547200,,4436,4.572327044025157

404693,5,630197753X,"There are two things these days that you will never again see in mainstream Hollywood children's entertainment:

Beautifully hand-drawn (cel-by-cel; in two dimensional) animation; and adult oriented, thought-provoking material, into a children's-themed motion picture. This is one of those ultra-rare beauties from the early 1980's, that combines the very best of both of those worlds.

Unlike the thoughtless, CGI-induced puff pieces that both Disney & DreamWorks seem to always consistently churn-out on a never-ending basis these days, this rare classic was made back in the days when quality American animation went hand-in-hand with genuine, original adult content, that was truly enjoyable for both the parents and the children-alike.

Personally? I grew up with this classic as a child, and I'd recommend it to anyone to see, if only just once. It's truly an over-looked classic that deserves far more attention than it's ever been given.

I'd recommend the Blu-ray, 'cause unlike my DVD copy (that I purchased back when it first debuted on that format), which was a poorly done digital transfer with only Full Screen (and not the Widescreen one) with only Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo; the BD copy does a wonderful job at this film's digital mastering transfer into high definition, along with the audio getting an over-haul update into the Dolby Digital 5.1/7.1 HD Surround-Sound. In fact, my only complaint about the Blu-ray edition is new cover, as seen in Amazon's photos, where I miss the original cover from the VHS one from my childhood (see attached photos), but then again, it's a small complaint since I didn't buy the Blu-ray copy for it's cover; I bought it for the movie, and in that most significant of aspects, it did not disappoint: I've never seen this movie such unbelievable clarity in resolution & so vivid in its colors, nor as mind-blowing amazing audio in it Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.....I feel like a kid all over again!",1427587200,6,1956,5.103125

THE SECRET OF NIMH: Pity poor field mouse Mrs. Brisby! Not only was her husband Jonathan recently killed, but one of her youngsters is ill, and cant be moved before the farmer begins plowing the field where they live. To save her family from certain death, she embarks on a desperate quest, roaming from dark forest to the underworld of the ratsa subterranean civilization complete with electricity! Everywhere she travels, her deceased husbands name inspires respect. But only ancient Nicodemus, ruler of the rats, can organize them to ensure her survival. And only he can reveal the secret of NIMH, and Jonathans role in it.

Discussion: The story behind this film is almost as interesting as the movie itself. Long before The Little Mermaid began the 1980s renaissance of Disney animation, Disney artist Don Bluth and his co-workers labored away at The Mouse Factory on such best-forgotten fare as The Black Cauldron. Disillusioned by the artistic and economic contraints imposed upon him by Disney, Bluth left in 1979 (taking 16 animators with him) to create this little gem. While not up to todays animated standards, this is probably the best animated movie Disney produced since The Jungle Book was released 15 years earlier.

All the classic Disney elements are here (plucky mice, goofy birds, an evil cat), but with a special spin: While Disney toons often featured a missing mother, here the hero *is* a motherand a strong woman to boot! Bluth also returned the dazzling lighting effects he wasn't allowed to budget during his days at Disneydetailed sparkling and flashing, for instance, and impressionistic sun-dappled, rippling water. His plot contains one harrowing incident after another, building in intensity, excitement and wonder up to its magical ending. No spoilersbut I will say that the secret of NIMH is clever and touchingand should have made this flick a favorite of animal rights activists.",1423180800,,2171,4.99171270718232

404800,5,630197753X,"I first saw ""The Secret of Nimh"" when I was 6. As kid the story of Mrs. Frisby bravely working to help move her home while her youngest child Timmy is ill was an exciting, scary and fun film to watch. It was only as I grew up that I would learn to appreciate this film on other levels beyond the obvious conflict presented.

It should be said that ""The Secret of NiMH"" is a gorgeous film. Crafted by Don Bluth after he and several other Disney animators began a small exodus from the mouse house after feeling the studio was moving in the wrong direction. Their goal on NIMH was to create a high quality animated classic that combined strong storytelling with fantastic animation. The result while not a commercial hit was a critical and artistic success.

""The secret of NiMH"" is filled with vivid characters. Mrs Brisby is a courageous widow whose primary concern is the safety of her children. Jeremy a clumsy awkward crow becomes her unlikely ally.  Her journey places herself in danger often for the welfare of her children. There is a wise rat named Nicodemis who is able to tell Mrs. Brisby more about her husband. And in one of the greatest scene is the movie Mrs Brisby visits the great owl. It is gorgeously animated scene set in a dark tree hollow filled with wispy spiderwebs and animal bones. The scene was scary as a kid but even more so as an adult when you realize how truly vulnerable Mrs Frisby is to the great owl. It is this act of selflessness that tell us so much about her character.

The film is filled with political intrigue also. The divisions between the rats in the rosebush and their own agenda add yet another layer to the tale. While all of this sounds very heavy (it is actually) none  of it is bogged down or makes the story boring to children.

Don Bluth's pacing of the story and great characterization make this an easy recommendation. I do wish they cover art had retained the original movie art. I understand the studios want to market the film to kids but the new cover looks very much like cheap kiddie fodder which is not befitting a movie like this.

The Secret of NiMH helped American animation move out of the 1970s doldrums and elevate the platform. It could even be argued that Don Bluth's success stemming from NiMH in the 1980s created some competition forcing Disney animation to step up ultimately creating the Disney renaissance that started with 1989's ""the little mermaid"". Ironically, it could be said once again it all started with a mouse.",1419897600,,2496,4.5456570155902005

404840,4,630197753X,"Don Bluth was a breath of fresh air when he was making his films and video games. During the 70's and early 80's Disney was starting to cut corners in their animated films and it started to show. It seems the grandeur of a Disney film was left to the classics made in the 50's or earlier. Bluth set out to bring back the magic of those traditional techniques, and The Secret of Nimh showcases his craftsmanship in a most dynamic way. The movie is visually striking even when some imperfections show up. Definitely a children's film that raises the bar what to expect from the genre.

The story is unique and even a little complex, but not perfect. It's about a field mouse, Mrs. Brisby, who has a sick child who cannot be moved from his bed. The problem is the humans who live close by will start harvesting crops soon and they live right in the thick of where the heavy equipment will plow by. She goes on a quest to find a way to move her home (with her children in it), which brings her deeper and deeper into the mysteries and magic of what happened to her husband along with who the enigmatic rats who live in the rose bush. I'm really giving way too little of what unfolds in the story, but I'm going to keep it that way. The other details are best experienced firsthand.

I really like the premise. It's not often you see a widow and mother star in a film... much less animated. Mrs Bisby comes out as a brave and compassionate character without having to make her some kind of stereotypical action hero or comic foil. As I said earlier the story ends up being pretty complex. With Mrs. Brisby seeking information in scary places and meeting up with all sorts of characters whom she's gained attention from based on dealings with her late husband. Mysticism, political intrigue, plots and plans pop up. Lots of questions come up in this film and lots of answers come too. Sometimes all too quickly. This movie doesn't shy away from putting a lot on the plate. Sometimes I feel the movie started to crush itself with all of its complexity. By the end it seems everything was resolved by a deus ex machina kind of event that seemingly comes out of nowhere. Thanks to Bluth's animation it ends up being a spectacular finale, however I can't help but feel it was taking the easy way out.

The Secret of Nimh doesn't shy away from mature themes and violence. There is death and themes that are rather brutal; more adult than one would expect from a children's movie. It's not a graphic film mind you, but you do see characters die (not just the bad guy) and they don't shy away from describing some atrocities. I don't think of it is too harsh for the young ones, especially with the family watching together. I feel when your child asks you those hard questions the movie brings up you get a chance to address them in an open forum and it gives you a chance to give them the reassurance that only a paternal bond can give.

If you want to see some amazing animation with lots of nuanced expressions on the characters' faces, lots of details both in background and foreground, organic flow in stuff like water, fire and other objects (a Don Bluth specialty), and dynamic lighting effects this movie is set to please. The crowing jewel of this film is the dedication to all these animated details. Several techniques were used in making The Secret of Nimh including varied color shades to simulate time of day, rotoscoping for realistic movement, camera multipasses for transparent shadows, and backlit animation for those amazing lighting and glow effects. ALL of these techniques are now a lost art, much the same as cell animation as a whole. This movie is practically an apex of what these traditional forms have to offer.

The soundtrack plays an important role on this film much like Disney relied on music for directing the action and emotion from their classic era. The music also helps with the fact there isn't a whole lot of environmental sounds on the film. Either by lack of funds or by design the movie does lack sound effects you normally find in films these days. Oftentimes, but not always, footsteps won't pound on the ground, water doesn't make a sound when splashed, other little noises you expect to hear are simply not there. To be honest this is something you may not even notice, as the music does certainly make up for it, but if you're picky you will notice the lack of foley work.

I would love to say the Blu-Ray is a magnificent remaster of a classic, but it's not. Indeed it looks much better than the DVD with more details and color popping out. However I think it's the same master that was used for the DVD. Lots of dust and artifacts remain on the film. For me it doesn't really distract from the film, and in a way helps retain that classic feel of being in the theater will you see specks or hairs now and then. Rest to be sure it's not a proper remaster. If that's what you are looking for you may have to wait until the studio ponies up the money for a proper cleaning up of the source material. Audio on the other hand is great. The DTS-HD Master 2.0 Channel Audio sounds wonderful with the dialog crisp and clear and the music full and detailed. The original soundtrack was in stereo, and I'm glad they didn't try to make this a surround sound simulation. Audio options are stereo in English and Spanish with Dolby mono in French, German, Portuguese and Italian (Subtitles in English, French and Spanish). The extras are sparse, and nothing new has been added since the 2007 DVD release. However I do find the extras are a treat:

Audio Commentary - Director Don Bluth and Producer Gary Goldman give a great amount of details on the animation of the movie in this commentary. There are also production details and how they worked within the budget constraints. You can tell this film was a labor of love for them, and this commentary is a gem to listen to.

Secrets Behind the Secret - This is a short making of documentary. It's maybe 15 minutes long or less, but it is packed with production information and details.

Theatrical Trailer

The Secret of Nimh was a benchmark in animation, and even though the story itself doesn't lend itself to a timeless classic many people would argue that it is better than most of the ""so called classics"" out there. If you are a fan of cell drawn animation (and you don't already know about this film) is a must have. If you have been waiting for a more sophisticated family film then wait no longer and get Nimh. The only real limitation is the fact this movie isn't properly remastered for HD. Maybe it will be someday and maybe it won't. Either way what you have here is a benchmark film.",1416268800,2,6671,4.4831275720164605

405334,5,630197753X,"I remember watching a good amount of animated films as a kid. This one in particular, though, was not one of them - I only watched it recently. And boy, did I miss out! The Secret of NIMH was, as you might already know, Don Bluth's first go at a full-length animated film after leaving Disney, and arguably his best work to date.

I don't wanna spoil too much about the movie's plot, but I'll try to summarize it. The main protagonist is a worried mother called Mrs. Brisby, the mouse. Her missions are to move her family before they get crushed by a farmer's plow, and to save her youngest son, Timothy, from dying from pneumonia. So basically, you're getting a darker, more dramatic story - quite unusual from a lot of animated movies, but that's what makes this film so special. You're not gonna see any characters sing and dance either, there's only one song in the movie (in this case, Flying Dreams), and it's not even sung by any of the characters! The animation, characters, and voice acting are excellent too. You feel for what Mrs. Brisby has to go through during the movie, and Jeremy the crow provides some nice comic relief.

If you're a parent and you have really young children, here's a warning - the movie has some pretty violent scenes near the end. There's also one use of mild language. How this movie got a G rating is beyond me, seriously!

Overall, with a dark and edgy story, likable characters, great animation, and no sappy songs to worry about, this is an awesome animated flick. I even think it's an amazing film in general. If you've never watched it before, go watch it! You won't be disappointed.

On her way back from seeing Mr. Ages, a rather cantankerous elderly mouse to gain medicine from him, she helps a crow to escape the farmer's cat and the next morning, realizes her problems are compounded not only by her child's Pneumonia, but that Moving Day has arrived. With the help of Auntie Shrew she manages to stop the tractor, but realizes it's only temporary. She then enlists the help of the crow, Jeremy, to take her to see the Great Owl, a being of both great wisdom, but of great terror, to mice. To her shock, the Owl knows of her late husband, and tells her that the rats in the rosebush as the best ones to help her move her home. She finds the rats and they do agree to help her, but feeling that there is something she can do to contribute, she agrees to drug the farmer's cat, and gets captured when she tries. While trapped, she overhears the farmer on the phone to a place called NIMH, and learned that they are coming to kill the rats.

The film conveys a spirit of adventure and many dramatic moments that had been rare in animated films. Like Watership Down, Pinocchio, Bambi and The Last Unicorn, this film stands apart because it is skillfully directed and voice-acted by a talented cast.  The film's characters are voice by Elizabeth Hartman (Mrs. Brisby), Derek Jacobi (Nicodemus), Dom Deluise (Jeremy), Arthur Malet (Mr. Ages), Hermione Baddeley (Auntie Shrew), John Carradine (The Great Owl), Peter Strauss (Justin), Paul Shenar (Jenner), Aldo Ray (Sullivan), Shannon Doherty (Teresa), and Will Wheaton (Martin).

The film is set on the FitzGibbon farm where a mouse family, a shrew and a community of rats lives. The movie is the tale of a brave mother mouse, Mrs. Brisby and her relationship with the Rats of NIMH, a mysterious community of super intelligent rats who live under the rose bush. mrs. Brisby needs help because of an impending threat to her family and must reach out to the Greta owl, the rats of NIMH and others.

405544,3,630197753X,"I loved the 1971 book ""Mrs. Frisby and The Rats of NIMH,"" by Robert C. O'Brien, as a young boy, so I was really bummed to see all of the changes that were made - for no good reason, IMHO. Sorry Mr. Bluth, but you made some seriously bad choices when adapting this book. Why re-name the main character? Rumor has it you were afraid of being sued by the Frisbee people? Really? You should have done a little more legal research instead of reacting with a knee jerk kowtow response to kiss some lawyer butt. Maybe, being a fledgling studio, they didn't want and/or couldn't afford any legal red tape? Who knows. I seriously doubt there would've been any legal reprisals anyhow since the the film was adapted from a book and in that novel that IS the character's actual surname, AND it's spelled differently than the toy! But whatever... too late to fix it now.

The creative team should have remained more faithful to the book. Their changes were not needed and more importantly did nothing to improve the original story. In the novel, test mice & rats undergo a series of laboratory experiments using chemical injections which cause adaptive/evolutionary biological changes. A fantastic premise, but one which was presented in a plausible, science-based manner. Why screw with a believable concept by adding in a bunch of magical, mystical nonsense? Another really bad call was the stylistic decision to give the owl and various rats glowing, headlight eyes without pupils. Perhaps the animators wanted to be different, thought it looked cool, added pizazz, or it was the ""in"" thing to do at that time? IMHO what it is, is distracting, unnecessary optical gobbledygook that takes away from the beautiful hand-drawn animation and the gorgeous background paintings. Those pupil-less eyes aren't cool. They're frickin' creepy, and they take you right out of the story. This film could (and should) have become a genuine classic every bit as good, or even better, than anything Disney ever did. Instead it's just OK, nothing more. That's really too bad because the animation is really quite lovely.

When Bluth left Disney to start his own animation studio, it took a lot of guts to be David in the face of Walt's Goliath. This film could have put him on the map as a serious contender. Instead, he and his films are more of a curious footnote in animation history. It had moderate box office success. He and his animation company went on to do An American Tail, The Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven, all of which did fairly well. Then things got pretty ugly as his later efforts, ""Rock-a-Doodle,"" ""Thumbelina,"" ""A Troll in Central Park,"" and ""The Pebble & The Penguin"" were all critical & box office flops.

Since we're not likely to ever see Mrs. Frisby & The Rats of NIMH adapted again, in any form, this version is all we have. The Blu-ray for this film is pretty decent, but nothing amazing. I don't think this film got any kind of special remastering or restorative treatment, but the transfer looks quite nice; the colors are vivid, the picture is nice & sharp, and the sound comes through nicely. I do not have a super-duper sound system; just the built-in speakers the my 60"" Sharp TV came with. Still the film's audio track has a pleasing sound and I'm sure it sounds even better with a spiffy surround system. Perhaps others who have that type of set up can share their impressions?

The 2 bonus features included along with the feature film are the original theatrical trailer and a running commentary with director/producer Don Bluth and producer Gary Goldman. I have not listened to this yet but I plan to. Hopefully Bluth & Goldman will touch on the history behind the novel as well as their adaption of it, and explain why they made so many bizarre (to me) changes from the book. It won't make me like the movie better, but perhaps it will make it a little easier to take. If you're a fan of Bluth Productions' films or just a fan of classic, hand-drawn cell animation, then it's a good purchase. If you're a fan of the original children's book and have never seen this film then be prepared for a lot of head-scratching changes & omissions. You may enjoy it. It's still a good movie and if I had never heard of nor read the book, I probably would have liked it a little bit more.",1387756800,,4300,4.639107611548557

The blu ray is phenomenal with great colors and amazing sound. You can hear every little detail and since so many of the characters talk softly or whisper throughout so much of the movie the enhanced sound really helps to pick out those little details.

It's very old animation, so the picture can only be enhanced so much. What really comes through are the colors and very bright and bold. The lines are as sharp as they can be considering the age of the art work but it's not bad at all. Just don't expect ""pore-visible"" quality.

The bad: the grain is obtrusive and the film is clearly in need of a restoration that will probably not happen until 4K or never. This looks WAY better than the Netflix stream which due to low bitrate was awful.

What is here is honestly quite decent if you get past the old master used. No DNR or very minimal and you get what looks like an older animation film. It's grainy, stability is questionable at times, and the whole things deserves more. But what is there is the most important factor. And for the price I can be okay with this for now.

Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is non existent in any of the Don Bluth movies. The only movie that is an exception is Anastasia. Other than that, they all deserve ONE STAR for video restoration.

Also, the movie adds in the magical aspect, but the book has no magic....just a scientific experiment that causes the rats to be super intelligent.

The Secret of NIMH, based on the american novel, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, is one of the most beautifully animated films ever to have been created. Designed and overseen by the limitlessly talented Don Bluth, this film carries his trademark animation styles and is one of his greatest works. It is a simple story. Simplified from what the book is and made to be a story that is enjoyable to watch as a movie, with a little bit of magic thrown in their too, a complete absence of it in the book version... never really was explained... what was the amulet all about... doesn't matter... it's simple and I love it. Its a simple story of a mothers love and how far she'll go to save her son form sickness and death. There are no films made these days that can compete with this story telling and unique design and animation. The pace just wouldn't hold today's audience, just like films such as Bambi and Dumbo, that both share simply developing story arcs, however, lack the pace to break to box office these days. The Secret of NIMH features some of the best character design done on a traditionally animated character. Completely hand drawn, Mrs. 'Brisby' is elegant and strong, also a brilliantly alluring creation. No mouse is better suited to be single mother. This movie is a treasure of traditional animation. I've seen it countless times and I hear the voices of the characters in my head throughout my merry days. They've changed the way I behave, I should really be careful.
Dom DeLouis, you where a delightful voice.

The Blu Ray version of this film has not had anything special done to it that I can see. Its not like they've gone through every frame and restored it. Personally, I'd prefer they didn't(by they, I mean whoever screwed (in want of a better word) up the cover art to FernGully). They could, if they wanted to, gone through the whole thing and coloured it in digital paints, and destroyed the film in the process. Instead, they've transferred an old copy with lines and stuff in it to a 25 GB Blu Ray DVD without a menu and left it the same way it was. That's fine. They've left it alone. I'm happy with that. The pictures the best its ever been for this film and the sounds fine. The cover art could be the original poster which is many times better than this one, however, its not too bad.

WOW. How did this movie slip under my nose for so long?
I have just one word to describe this film: OUTSTANDING.  Before Don Bluth started going soft and making the most putridly sanitized kids films you can imagine, he did this, his directorial debut.  His only prerequisites were the videogame Dragon's Lair, and also lead animation for Pete's Dragon and The Rescuers.  But what a debut it is! This movie is simply amazing. The animation is dazzling, the story is creative, it has a nice edge to it, and it has an underlying message of courage and friendship.  I wish I had seen this as I child, or I would have bought it a long time ago.
Based (loosely) upon the book Mrs. Frisby and the rate of NIMH by Robert C. O'Brien, the story concerns Mrs. Frisby(voiced by the late Elisabeth Hartman), a young mother mouse, is looking for a cure for her son, who is deathly ill with Pneumonia. She seeks out the local doctor, Mr. Ages (Arthur Malet), who provides her with medicine. Further trouble ensues when it is discovered that the farmer who owns the land is going to start plowing early, which will destroy Mrs. Frisby's home is she doesn't act quickly. Though they succeed in temporarily disable the plow, they still need to find a way to relocate, and fast.

This leads her first to the great horned owl (John Carridine), and then to a secret society of super intelligent rats, aptly named The Rats of NIMH, who live in a nearby rosebush. They are (or should I say were) genetically enhanced by getting a serum injected into them when they were lab rats at NIMH: the National Institute of Mental Health.  This gave them superior intelligence, which enabled them to easily escape.  The late Mr. Frisby is looked upon with particular fondness, as he was the mouse who made the escape possible.  This is the only part in the story that may be a tad too dark for real little kids, as it shows simulated animal cruelty, but it's not that bad. Their home is an imaginative realm of both technology and magic: they have electricity borrowed from the local farmer-this plot points reminds me a bit of Mary Norton's The Borrowers- and also possess a magic amulet called ""The Stone"" that grants the wearer powers when they are courageous. With the help of a Rat named Nicodemus (voiced by Peter Strauss), Mrs. Frisby &  Jeremy(Dom Deluise)a clumsy crow,  race against time, and also dissention in the ranks from the power-hungry Jenner(Paul Shenar), to get Mrs. Frisby's home out of harms' way.
A word about the DVD quality: It's pretty good.  Some transfers of older more obscure films have been absolutely horrible, but this is not too shabby.  No real complaints here. I would've like a little more in the way of extra features, but oh well.
This film has been somewhat criticized for deviating too much from the source novel (the whole mysticism element was totally absent in the book), also for being too violent for kids.  Let me just say that I truly believe that most kids can handle (somewhat) mature content, as long as it's not too intense or overly disturbing, but I don't feel this is.  Something like Watership Down (the 1978 British version) is MUCH darker than this.  With that said, give this old neglected Gem a much deserved buffing and a watch. And, as one tagline said, rediscover the child within all of us!",1356912000,,3352,4.648054145516075

406088,5,630197753X,"I remember seeing this on VHS when I was little, but I knew it was a theater release film.  For years, I wondered if this title was originally in widescreen or 4:3 ratio as that is all I had ever seen it in.  But I always suspected, it was a widescreen film.  Finally, the blu-ray is released and its the first time ever, that I found it widescreen.  For that reason alone, its worth the purchase.  As for the transfer, its a very nice transfer.  I wouldn't say its perfect, but its nice.  I noticed a lot of ""dust"" for lack of a better word in a lot of the scenes.  Honestly, I think it was on the original cells when the they were laid across the backgrounds, although it could just as likely be related to the aging/degrading of the original masters. You have to remember that the studio that made this film had just been formed, and was pretty much being run out of a garage. And while some backgrounds looked grainy, I don't really think it was ""grain"" from the transfers.  I believe it comes from the high def details that come out when you take a painted background and blow it up to 42"" on the new TVs.  Other background scenes were perfect.  And for the most part, the widescreen format doesn't particularly add a great deal of ""WOW"" factor to the movie. Most scenes seemed framed by the edges, so cutting out the edges just takes away a little of the depth.  Although, there were some exceptions like some of the up high views of the farm that really put the whole world of the story into view.  You see what seems like a rather small world but becomes immense when considering the nature of the main characters.  Also, the scenes where Ms. Brisby first goes to the rats of NIHM, the widescreen really shows off the efforts of the animators.  Its animation at its best.  All in all, the new transfer makes this film look as good as it ever has, possibly with  the exception of its original release.  And the transfer allows this great film stand toe to toe with about 90% of the Disney films of the same era.  The animation style puts you in mind of The Black Caldron.  But the true strength of this movie lies in its story.  Its an interesting premise that is usually reserved for sci-fi films. Its a film that seems to have everything a kids film would want even if some of it sometimes contradicts the setting.  You have hero's and heroines, villains and treachery,sword fights, sages, wizards and magic.  You even have a Dragon.  Spoiler alert: its the name of the cat, but equally as evil and menacing when your heroine is a mouse.  So if you remember this film fondly from your childhood, buy it.  If you've never seen it, but you love animation, buy it.  If you have kids, buy it.  And if you already own the film on DVD or Laserdisc or both (like me), you obviously like the movie so you might as well buy it before it goes out of print as most great films do and usually far too quickly. Hope that helps anyone who is asking the question, should I buy this.",1328400000,6,2976,4.313513513513514

406092,3,630197753X,"I've been a fan of Don Bluth since I was a young child. These were the movies that I loved watching over and over again, even if it meant renting to get said movies. One of my all time favorites happens to be The Secret of NIMH. However, that being said, it is also one of the movies with quite a few flaws in it.

Originally, I owned the movie on VHS and I remember having to turn the televisions sound way up in order to hear what is going on. The DVD version is no different. The sound it self is all right, the levels applied make it seem like the sound is still formatted for the movie theater, not actual home release. That said, the voice acting is superb.

The animation is basic and old school, and there are also a few places that things aren't that clear. The movie is possibly a little darker then some parents would want for their kids. Yes, the G rating means general audience, but general audience does not mean little children whose age group is still learning to sit still. It isn't overly violent, but there is character death.

That said, the movie sticks very well with the book, which I have read, way after I first saw the movie as a child. The main parts are there, not to mention one picks up the charm of the characters. There are a few major changes which don't change the fact that the storyline is enjoyable, but it did effect the ability to make a second movie.

The whole thing is delightful and one of those that children will remember well. However, there is that problem with sound as I pointed out and the small bit of violence that not all children are going to be ready to deal with.",1312243200,2,1619,4.246753246753247

Don Bluth and company really peered over new horizons with their painstaking efforts on this picture, and ultimately gave their old bosses and coworkers at Disney the kind of direct competition they needed to wake up from their late '70s slump. Bluth's unmistakable style positively seeps out of every panel of NIMH, with an expressive, gestural quality that manages to be both creatively streamlined and rich with detail. The story, so dark that Disney actually opted out of making the film themselves, remains a breath of fresh air even today, thirty years after its premiere. Its broad landscapes and diverse characters tackle some very challenging themes with succinct honesty, respecting their viewers without scaring them off. Too many kids' movies resign themselves to the opinion that children need their hands held on a stroll through happy town from start to finish, with a reassuring character always nearby whenever something remotely spooky happens. NIMH rejects that theory, cautiously, and ends up a better picture for all audiences as a result. It's a revelation.",1302048000,,1193,5.351063829787234

Someone lied to Gary Goldman.  In the audio commentary with him and Don Bluth, he starts off by saying the edition they are watching is not as good as what we will be eventually seeing, and they will be cleaning it up for the final product, taking out the scratches and dirt.  While he's saying that, there is an excessive amount of scratches and dirt on the screen.  That's not a nice thing to do to Mr. Goldman.  It does not look like any restoration work was done at all.  Now, if you are a film purist, and enjoy the 'original look' of the projected image, going so far as to wait until a film's last week at theaters, so you can enjoy that aged film quality, then this is the transfer for you.  This looks as if there was no digital processing done at all either, so no worry about waxy or overly glossy images here, nothing but pure grain and silt.

Sound was good, in all of it's DTS-HD 2.0 glory.  Yes, 2.0, no other English options.  Purists rejoice.

Also, there is no top menu, none.  Only a very minimal pop-up menu.  When you put the disc in, it runs a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang trailer, which you can only skip with fast forward, then the movie starts right up.

""The Secret of NIMH"" was released by United Artists in 1982.  With the voice talents of Elizabeth Hartman, Dom Deluise, and Derek Jacobi, it tells a mature and dark story.

Adapted from Robert C. O'Brien's book ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,"" it tells of a mother mouse's attempt to relocate her family home in the wake of the dangers of the farmer's plow.  This story is interesting enough, and its suspense is elevated by the presence of a gravely ill 'child' mouse named Timmy.  Another layer which adds a great amount of sophistication and intrigue is an underground society of rats, led by the wise Nicodemus.  A stunning vocal performance by Derek Jacobi makes Nicodemus a very striking character in the film, but mature animation could also render him nightmare-inducing for very young and/or sensitive children.

The heart and soul of the movie is Elizabeth Hartman's remarkable vocal realization of the mother mouse, renamed for the movie as 'Mrs. Brisby.'  Her relationship with a helpful, yet clumsy crow and her late husband Jonathan's mysterious connection to the titular research laboratory('NIMH'='National Institute of Mental Health') both help drive the movie forward on a strong narrative engine.

The current DVD cover art is somewhat misleading, using soft animation to depict the characters in what can be described as an idealized light.  In the movie itself, the characters are considerably less idealized, and the tone makes for what I believe to be one of the most mature animated movies ever produced.

""The Secret of NIMH"" is one of the best animated films ever produced, punctuated by great music culminating in a touchingly romantic final song called ""Flying Dreams.""  Highly recommended.",1296950400,,1738,5.145907473309609

I finally got my hands on the DVD and watched it with them when we finished the book.
What a disappointment! Never has Hollywood sugar coated a story more pitifully than in the Secret of NIMH. Its great if you are 5 years old and want to see goodies and baddies running around with magic stones and slap stick humour. You could liken it to a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The sequence about NIMH itself was glossed over in seconds - the crux of the book!
The characterisation was ludicrous and the narrative boring. Id be happy to send this to anyone, for free! Just get in touch

406273,5,630197753X,"The Secret of NIMH is an astonishingly beautiful, thoughtful, and touching story about the unbreakable bond between a mother and her children. Forget for a moment that it's about mice and rats; the premise of this movie is so human, which is why it hits so close to home and turns me into a leaky faucet every time I watch it. No animated movie even comes close to affecting me the same way that Don Bluth's masterpiece does.

Whereas most animated films made in the last 20 years deal with exaggerated personalities, tired comic relief and unbelievable plots, NIMH concerns itself with far more realistic characters and situations that viewers can easily relate to. Mrs. Brisby is a single mother, recently widowed, with a simple home and a loving, if not challenging family - a toddler, two bickering older children, and a sickly, bedridden child. In the greater scheme of things, she considers herself just another mouse on the farm, and not particularly special or important. Her humbleness is partly why this story is so amazing. She never complains about her plight in life, never takes any credit for her actions and never gives any other character attitude. And while she is exceptionally fearful of the violent and unpredictable world outside of her comfortable home, she is determined enough to save her family that she braves certain death by visiting the Great Owl and drugging the farmer's cat Dragon with tranquilizer. Her courage impresses the intelligent rats of NIMH and, combined with her deceased husband's legacy, they are moved to help her save her family from imminent doom. I am similarly moved watching this mother tirelessly fight to save her kids. What other animated movie has an even remotely similar plot? None that I can think of - and it's precisely this human situation that makes The Secret of NIMH stand above its animated counterparts.

""Courage of the heart is very rare, the stone has a power when it's there."" This simple rhyme is really the epitome of what the movie is all about: that love will get you through any adversity. This movie - and its message - is meant for adults just as much as children, and will remain one of the great classic animated stories of all time.",1286150400,2,2213,4.805774278215223
406324,1,630197753X,"My nearly-4-year-old son enjoys anything animated, and as a child I loved the book this film was ""based"" on, so it seemed like a no-brainer for this to be a hit in our household.

However, every single scene in the film is amazingly frightening and/or violent, what with the snarling evil cat, threatening glowing-eyed rats, shouting angry neighbors, animals being injected with giant hypodermic needles and writhing in pain and fear, sword-fighting and knife-throwing rats with bloody wounds and some of them dying, children (mice) being nearly burned and suffocated inside their home, etc.

Maybe this would be okay for older kids--above 6 or 7?--but it's definitely not for the younger ones (and I probably wouldn't make it my first choice for the older ones, either). I kept fast-forwarding to try to find a few minutes that weren't scary, but was repeatedly surprised that there simply weren't any. There were a few moments of slapstick humor with the crow, but they were very fleeting. There is a happy ending, but only after 1.5 hours of terror and darkness.

The whole film was exceedingly dark and brooding in mood and aspect, and every single scene had the protagonist or her children in so much danger that it was just too much for a little one. It's way more so than any children's video I've seen.

I'm not saying that it's not a well-animated feature for its time, but that's not the only thing that I look for in a children's film.

Also, I recognize that not every film will mirror the book it came from, and sometimes this is a good thing. But for this film, I felt it was really a poor adaptation that completely undermined the main thrust of the book (really, all the good parts). If you loved the book, you will probably not like the film. Instead of science and intelligence, the rats have magic powers, which to me is a lame cop-out. Also, there is a really unnecessary power struggle and lots of internecine violence between the rats.

The original would have made an extremely good film as it was, with of course some events collapsed for film format. I guess the title of the film being different than the title of the book should have been a clue that this would be an entirely different story. This film should say ""inspired by"" The Rats of Nimh rather than ""based on.""",1283126400,7,2296,4.6567901234567906

This came on CN when I was little and I never really got into it and deeply regret it.  One thing I really loved was the suspense. This is really intense for a kids movie and that is a plus! The action had me on the edge of my seat, more so than any R rated thriller I've watched this year. The story was also dark. I really felt for Mrs. Brisby and wanted the best for her. I've never seen an animated movie (besides Plague Dogs) where everything bad that could happen to the main character does. The scenery in some parts of the movie was absolutely breathtaking expecially the detail put in the Rats home. This is a wonderful movie for children and parents alike.

406329,5,630197753X,"Everyone has seen The Land Before Time. Everyone has heard of An American Tail. Some have enjoyed All Dogs Go to Heaven. But what about The Secret of NIMH? Well, sadly, it's not very well-known, especially today when CGI animation (Pixar & Dreamworks) has been dominating theaters for over ten years now. As one who prefers the traditional 2D style of animation, I find The Secret of NIMH to be far superior to many CGI-animated films (The Ant Bully, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, etc.). It has a very deep story, some provocative characters, and some truly beautiful animation. The only problem with this film is the character Jeremy. I like Dom DeLuise (R.I.P.), but the crow he voices is really irritating, and really distracts from the serious tone of the overall film. But I guess the character is necessary for the kids, while the rest of the film becomes a pure delight for adults. Yes, this movie can be for both kids and adults. In fact, I think The Secret of NIMH is a bit more for the adult crowd, mostly because of the mature subject matter and of the minimal amount of cuteness surrounding the talking mice. Don't let the cover art for this DVD fool you: this is no ordinary animated film. It's a very thought-provoking film that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages. This is one of Don Bluth's greatest works, and amidst the CGI phenomenon, this is still one of the better animated films to have been created.

While I am uncertain if I would recommend it for very young children, I have always been impressed at how this film deals with such serious subjects as responsibility, loneliness and mortality in a way that doesn't talk down to kids.

I'm quite happy that TSON is now finally available in widescreen with this edition. I do wish that this film would get the conscientious remastering of which it is so deserving. While the picture is generally clean, some scenes appear rather washed out, and the whole movie suffers a bit from ""telecine jitter"".

406435,1,630197753X,"Before tearing into this film, I commend Bluth for venturing out from Disney and keeping a medium alive during its floundering years; however, when I compare this movie's animation to Disney movies from the golden age or the 90s, it doesn't hold up. The poor layouts don't lead your eye like the compositions in ""Peter Pan"" or ""Aladdin"". Don Bluth always acted like he learned everything from the Disney studio that he needed to know when he departed, but this poor adaption really proves he never learned the art of storytelling. I remember reading the ""Mrs Frisby ..."" book in 5th grade, and then being shocked at how this movie didn't really convey it. As far as the art, the gaudy color palette used throughout the movie is in my opinion its biggest flaw. No color goes unused in any scene. Of course that kind of background painting was par for the course back in the 70s and early 80s; even Disney colorists couldn't help but unload every color on the paper. The backgrounds are cluttered and compete with the characters. The character draftsmanship is good, that's why it's so sad to see it ruined on backgrounds with no tonal color theme coupled with uninspired vocal performances. The voice actors are weak, I guess one take was good enough back then or maybe that's all they could afford for the production. Dom Deluise's crow character should have been limited to two scenes of his lame tomfoolery. Does a 122-minute movie really need 10 minutes of a crow getting tangled in everything? Buddy Hackett's seagull ""Scuttle"" in ""Little Mermaid"" shows the potential of a clumsy bird character. I recommend making this one of the last animated film DVDs you purchase, along with the other junkers: Balto, American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Thumbelina, All Dogs Go to Heaven, and the Land Before Time series. It's always been shocking to me that those movies even got funded. A good rule of thumb is ""if Dom Deluise is in the cast it's going to be a lousy cartoon"".",1213660800,3,1967,4.72093023255814

406440,4,630197753X,"Many animated movies come and go but very few have the staying power to be called classics. No, I'm not talking about Disney films (which seem to be called ""Disney's Classic"" before the movie has a chance to become a classic these days), but non-animated films that tend to show people that animation is truly different from live-action. ""Spirited Away"" was a movie that showed there are some stories no Hollywood budget could properly produce. ""American Pop"" showed everyone that sophisticated adult stories could work in the form of animation. Then we have ""The Secret of NIMH,"" the revolutionary animated movie about a mother mouse attempting to save her family. In this movie though her family is not in danger of a evil rat who's looking to marry the widowed mother, but of Pneumonia, which one of her sons has.

This normally wouldn't be any more of a concern then it needs to be, but the harvest has come early, threatening to destroy the Brisby house when the farmer starts his tracker. With the risk of a chilled wind taking the life of her son, Mrs. Brisby seeks out help from a gang of rats who escaped from the secret society of NIMH, a place that captured them and tortured them through ""unspeakable tortures."" This is where I end my summery, as I'm afraid of ruining the masterpiece that is ""The Secret of NIMH."" There are many attempts made to make animation more then what currently is. I remember how ""The Lord of the Rings"" was put into production to create an animated movie that could truly bring to life the fantasy world Tolken created, yet the movie came off as slow and tedious.

With ""The Secret of NIMH"" Don Bluth, along with several former Disney animators, created a film that is both stunning and emotional at the same time. For a movie about a bunch of rats, it's amazing how complicated it can be. Bluth holds on to key elements of the story, letting the mystery unfold over the course of the film, leaving the audience to savor the unraveling mystery and power of a well crafted screenplay. Characters who appear to be two-dimensional later on prove to be complicated characters, and indeed, you may be shocked to discover some situations are very different then what you originally predicted they would be. Though the movie was largely animated out of Bluth's garage, the movies animation is stunning to watch.

There are several key scenes that are beautiful to look at, and show much skill behind the craft of animation. A couple of the scenes even look like you could frame and pass off as a classic painting. It's a movie that has aged remarkably well over time, and when kids watch it today they get their first taste of how animation can be new, bold, exciting, and different. It's a movie that not only inspires to be better then most animated films, but most movies period. The only real celebrity in the movie is that of Oscar winning composer Jerry Goldsmith, who provides one of the classic movie scores of our time, and gives the movie a depth that would be lacking would it not be for the score. Most animated scores are a set-up for a musical number. The score in ""The Secret of NIMH"" sounds like one that would sound at home in a movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The English Patient.""

That said, there are bits about the movie that don't work. First of all for all the praises I sing about the animation, since it WAS animated in a garage it's of a 1.33:1 aspect ratio as opposed to a widescreen ratio, which means the movie doesn't as much of a cinematic scope as I'd like it to have. Also a bumbling crow named Jeremy (and voiced by Dom DeLuise) is one of those annoying sidekicks that exist mainly to provide comic relief and to get in the way. Granted, Jeremy's presence isn't fatal, just annoying. There's still far more good in this movie then there is bad, and truth be told, these shortfalls have only become noticed by me as a result of seeing the film so many times. But despite the number of times I see it, ""The Secret of NIMH"" is a movie that still aims higher then most movies I've seen.

406513,4,630197753X,"I purchased this movie several years ago on VHS, and have put off buying a DVD because I'm waiting for a widescreen version.  My copy is still in good shape as we don't watch it constantly (it's a little intense for my 3-year-old) so I'm not feeling pressured to upgrade just yet.

Many of the more recent movie releases that are advertised primarily for children seem to fall either into the ""so sweet that it's painful to watch"" group or the ""spoiled brats with idiots for parents"" group. This movie doesn't pander to either of these camps. I would say that it hearkens back to a more old-fashioned style of storytelling. The kind where the choices one makes determine ones' destiny, and there is definitely a moral to the story.

The characters that we perceive as ""good"" in this story are that way because they chose to do what they knew was right, or best for everyone, even when those choices may have made their own lives more difficult, or even dangerous. The characters perceived as ""bad"" have made choices based solely on their own self-interest, with total disregard for how their choices may affect anyone else.

The animation is truly a pleasure to look at. I find myself wishing the story were longer, so that we could see more of the rats' underground dwelling. One of my pet peeves regarding this movie is that it is not available in a widescreen version, so all of those shots of the underground city have been cropped on the sides, eliminating large chunks of the gorgeously detailed scenery.

I do not know if the producers have enough material to justify a 2-disk repackaging, but PLEASE, won't you consider doing a widescreen version? Artwork and early storyboards are nice, commentaries by the filmmakers are even better, but just let us see the whole picture, as it was originally envisioned, not a truncated-for-TV version!

In summary, this is an engaging story that teaches good lessons for young viewers (or even older ones). There are a couple of scenes that sensitive children may find disturbing, so I recommend that you watch this (at least the first time) with your child, in case they get scared, need to be reassured, or have questions about why something bad is happening to the good guys. The good guys win, by the way. The bad guys are vanquished, and one redeems himself somewhat. One person is killed, but his killer is brought to justice.

In case you're worried about gory death scenes, don't. You see the character alive and well, then the ""camera"" pans to something else, you hear someone cry ""look out!"" and when you see the character again, he is lying on the ground, with another character kneeling by his side. They have a short conversation, and then he breathes his last. No blood, no gore. Disturbing, yes. All deaths are disturbing, or should be. Gory, no.

On the whole, I think this movie rates five stars, but because of the widescreen issue I have only given a four-star rating to this DVD version. Since the fullscreen version states that it has been ""formatted to fit your screen"" the movie was obviously originally in a wider screen format than has been presented, and I see no good reason why when the DVD version was produced, it could not have been done as a widescreen version! Perhaps they thought more viewers would prefer a fullscreen version, and didn't want to produce two versions (which would have cost more, admittedly.)

I have lately found many movies that have only recently been released on DVD, and they are all widescreen versions! I'm talking about mostly junk movies for $3.50 and $5.00 at Wal-Mart! This is a classic movie! It deserves a decent widescreen presentation! Digital restoration if necessary, but WIDESCREEN please!

Okay, thanks for listening, and if you don't have it already, buy this movie! It's still a great story even in the ""truncated"" format.",1168128000,7,3841,4.762406015037594
406514,4,630197753X,A surprisingly good yarn populated by intriguing and entertaining characters and very well animated for its time.,1162771200,,113,5.705882352941177
406515,5,630197753X,"During a scene in the Secret of NIMH, Mrs. Brisby, the film's heroine, reads an inscription that says: ""You can open any door if you only have the key."" The nuance, if you listen to the lullaby during the end credits, is that this key is love. In a film rich with nuances, this one is the key not only for Mrs. Brisby but also for the film itself, for it was Don Bluth and his team's obvious love for the art of animation that enabled them to create this moving dramatization of Robert C. O'Brien's novel.

The Secret of NIMH is as much for adults as it is for children. Emotional and often tense, it explores what it means to be truly human, courageous, and loving.

The film, which departs somewhat from the novel, is about a widowed field mouse, Mrs. Brisby, who must move her children before the farmer crushes her home during the spring plowing. But her youngest son is critically ill with pneumonia and cannot be moved. After rescuing a lonely but charming crow, Jeremy, Mrs. Brisby visits with his help the Great Owl, hoping that he can solve her conundrum. The solution, the Owl says, is to seek help from the feared and mysterious Rats of NIMH, who live in the rosebush near the farmer's house.

During the film, as Mrs. Brisby repeatedly risks her life to save her family, she learns many secrets. She learns the secret of her husband's death and his connection with the Rats. She learns about the Rats' struggle. And she learns that, with her mother's love and courage, she possesses that essential but elusive key to open any door.

The Rats of NIMH, collectively, are one of the most evocative symbols in storytelling of the question of humanity, what it means to be human, to think and feel as a human. Their struggle represents the central question of humanity -- that of morality. Once tortured at NIMH (the National Institutes of Mental Health) by ""humans,"" and genetically engineered to develop intelligence associated with humans, the Rats are divided about their destiny. Should they live in the rosebush, stealing food and electricity from the farmer's stores, or should they leave to build their own civilization, a society based on moral choices? Should they help Mrs. Brisby? Some of the rats consider her to be one of ""the lower animals"" who should fend for themselves, yet others feel compassion and honor her husband's courage in helping to free them from NIMH.

In the Rats' and in Mrs. Brisby's struggles, we ask ourselves what it means to be human and whether we, considering our behavior towards others, are truly human. Is morality, is humanity, a province belonging only to us? Does it belong to us at all?

I think it's not too much to say that this story charges us to consider whether we, who experiment on ""the lower animals"" and disregard them, are not as human as the Rats, for we are building our society on practices many consider to be immoral choices, whereas the Rats seek a society based on moral choices.

This is an intricate film with an evocative score, backgrounds, character body language, and script to express the urgency and violence of the characters' struggles. But it is also an inspiring story with Jeremy's reliable comic relief and -- a spoiler here -- a happy end. As an artistic work, it shows what can happen when artists have the key and cooperate to use it.

I recommend to parents that you watch this with your children and discuss it with them to the degree you feel comfortable. It's one of the better ways to explore valuable lessons about courage, compassion, morality, and love.",1158192000,29,3549,4.6672
406516,5,630197753X,"""The Secret of NIMH"" is by far one of the best movies you could ever watch. The animation is brilliant, the music is flawless, and the actors are superb. I recently purchased a copy of this DVD, and I can honestly tell you that I received my money's worth.

The movie is about Mrs. Brisby, a meek field mouse with four children, who recently lost her beloved husband Johnathan in a tragic accident. Her youngest son, Timothy, is dangerously ill with pneumonia. He cannot go outside, but the farmer of the field in which they live is getting his tractor all set, so Mrs. Brisby has to move her family, otherwise they'll all be killed. Mrs. Brisby, as you can well imagine, is feeling distressed. She pays a visit to the Great Owl, and is told to go to the rats of NIMH, who live in a rosebush just outside the farmer's house.

Mrs. Brisby does as she is told, and meets with Nicodemus, a wise old rat who is the leader, and who was also a very good friend of Johnathan when he was alive. The rats of NIMH are currently planning on journeying to Thorn Valley, but Jenner, a cold-hearted rat with a lust for power, will not hear of it.

This movie is full of suspense, heart, and even humor. Mrs. Brisby makes a wonderful heroine, Nicodemus makes a supreme leader, and Jenner makes an outstanding villain. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I highly recommend that you do so.",1156550400,3,1378,4.396078431372549

Every character in this film is endearing (Jeremy the crow is my personal favorite). The film is also filled with eye candy, the colors and background paintings and animation is top notch. NIMH boring? Not at all, I found this film to be extremly entertaining and the story kept my interest the whole way through, and this statement is coming from a 38 year old man!

Yes I saw NIMH as a child but the charm still captures my heart to this day. Don Bluth is a master animator in my opinion, and thankfully he is carrying the torch for this little used art form in this time of computer animation. Why on earth can't both mediums exist? Handdrawn versus computer? I'll take hand drawn everytime! The heart in this film comes from ALOT of HARD WORK and from alot of talented people that had a love for the art form of hand drawn animation. Deep down inside, I believe Mr. Bluth will have the last laugh as hand drawn animation will make a comeback.

To the one reviewer who obviosly was not paying attention during this film, NIMH stands for NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH.

I assume it's some nasty lab that does nasty things to rats to make them intelligent. But they also seem to be exterminators. And unless I dozed off and missed it, they never explained what the letters N.I.M.H. stand for. They're written in upper-case letters, so probably they stand for something.

The only characters I found remotely interesting were the owl, the cat and the crow. (I did like the kid calling the crow a turkey; that was cute.) It was a delight to hear John Carradine's voice again. He must have been at death's door when that was made. Dom DeLuise was fun. Elizabeth Hartman, whoever she is, had no personality whatsoever. She came across as a total wimp. Just at the point where she might have developed into someone interesting, the movie ended very abruptly with the two crows forming patterns in the sky with their string. Huh? Did they run out of film at that point? Or money?

Anyway, the watercolor backgrounds were pretty.

The rats of the farm area, along with Mrs. Brisby's late husband, had escaped from some kind of genetic engineering lab!! Cool, that's all I thought as I watched the whole flashback sequence. As an avid fan of Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turles and Ghostbusters (both animated series at the time), the sci-fi twist was all I needed to keep me glued to my seat. I highly recomend this film.

406574,3,630197753X,"I would like to commend the efforts of Don Bluth and his Production Staff for bringing us The Secret of NIMH. Though somewhat altered thematically from the book, Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, we're still offered a work which succeeds at the both children's and adult levels. The outcome is wonderful and often magical.

The cast was carefully selected and their efforts are quite excellent. I appreciate especially the reading of Elizabeth Hartman as Mrs Brisby. Double kudos to Dom de Louis for providing us some much needed comic relief. His vocal talents provide the needed balance with the dark themes and the somber treatment of the material.

The blatant political message of mistreatment and misuse of animals in scientific research by the unknowing and uncaring humans is made pretty clear. If, then, a Central Idea is presented to us, I would suggest this: ""to know more than we once did, to achieve the next level, invites us also to no longer live as we once did. With more ability comes also more responsibility."" It seems that this advice would pertain to Man as well as Rats.

A couple of really inspired scenes stuck me: Chapter 13, where Mrs Brisby meets with the Great Owl; and the Rat Moot in the Council Meeting, found in Chapter 17. I affirm Paul Shenar's Jenner (in his several scenes) is a perfect charlatan and scoundrel: a genuine `dirty rat.' He gets his come-upons toward the end, though. I must confess, however, that I found the overly drawn `deus ex machina' nature of The Stone (i.e. ""the sparkly"") in Chapter 30 quite too much.

Several other Amazon Reviewers have mentioned the grainy quality of the image transfer to DVD and this is somewhat accurate. Nevertheless, the method and technology of the time ages well. On my copy, the colors are bright, clear and vibrant, and are quite pleasing to my eye.

I ran the DVD through both a common Hitachi TV and a Home Theatre quality system and found the sound very good. My only significant difficulty was in understanding Nicodemus, which may have more to do with Derek Jacobi's speaking range and vocal inflection than anything else. Even boosting the volume during these passages didn't help much.

There is a curious addendum to this review. I feel that due to the subject matter and some rather scary images, this feature should be more properly rated PG. I recommend that you view it (again) before showing it to younger children.

I'm thinking Three Stars is just about right.

406575,3,630197753X,"This is one of the more inspired films to come out of the American animated kids' genre. The story is intriguing and original, a far cry from the typical generic, condescending product that normally gets marketed to kids. This film's uniqueness is clearly owed to the brilliant book upon which it was based: Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by Robert C. O'Brien.

 It's an emotionally-charged movie, being centrally the story of a widowed mother who must venture out into a world of danger and struggle against enormous odds, determined to find medicine for her dying son. The artwork is brilliant, being gorgeous at times and terrifying at others. The voice acting is excellent as well. The film is a little darker and scarier than what one might normally expect from an American kids' movie. People have widely varying opinions on scary stuff in kids' movies. I was eight when this movie first came out, and I loved it. It's definitely not any scarier than Pinnochio; now that movie is disturbing! I suppose it might be more correct to say that not all of the characters in The Secret of NIMH are cute, and some are downright ugly. The rats of NIMH are, after all, rats. But that doesn't stop them from being likeable. You will find yourself cheering for some of them, booing others, and even crying for some.

 I would love to own this movie on DVD. I will not buy this DVD, however, because of its reportedly bad transfer and because it is only available in the butchered, ""reformatted to fit your screen"" version. The Secret of NIMH desreves the artistic respect that certain animated classics enjoy, such as Snow White and Fantasia. It is definitely worth being released in widescreen with a decent-quality transfer that does justice to the artwork and a soundtrack to match. Unfortunately, for now it seems to be getting the throw-away treatment befitting most of the garbage that gets marketed to kids. Hence the three stars instead of four. What's the point of having a DVD if it's poor quality?

Hopefully someday this excellent film will get the treatment it deserves.",1140220800,6,2079,4.763888888888889

But the movie is only loosely connected with the book.  Science has been replaced with magic.  The rats' struggles against nature and NIMH have been replaced with a struggle against an evil nemesis.  The heartrending ending in the book has been replaced with an action sequence.

It's painful when every frame is so painstakingly drawn, to miss what's happening on the edges. This is a great film that has touched several generations. It's unfortunate that MGM doesn't recognize the potential it has to touch people of a broad range of ages. Work of this quality deserves better treatment.",1131580800,4,625,5.198019801980198

  Some scruples others have had are the change of Mrs. Frisby's name to Brisby.  Either it was an issue of copyright (Frisbee) or of ""Ha, ha, her name's Frisbee!"" echoing throughout theaters, I trust that Don Bluth had his reasons.  Some have disliked the fantasy aspects of the film.  I personally think that they added, but that's only a matter of opinion.  And finally, the flashing lights and glowing eyes DO get somewhat gratuitous.  However, I can ignore them, and they don't really distract me.  If you claim to like animation at all, you have to see this movie.  This animation is beautiful.  This is the work of true masters.  JUST LOOK AT THEM MOVE!  I almost passed out when Nicodemus' hands/insanely-complex-robe came on after the opening credits.

  The characterization is amazing, too.  Justin is brave and heroic, Nicodemus is wise, and Jenner is as villainous a rapscallion as ever graced the animated screen.  But even so,  the true glory of the characters is Mrs. Brisby.  Have you ever noticed how all the girls in movies these days are idiots?  I sure have!  And Mrs. Brisby does NOT fall into this category.  She's quiet and careful, but she's brave and determined, too. She can tell whether someone is a good person or not.  She's kind and sympathetic and humble.  She is, perhaps, my favorite heroine of all time.

  Yes, this movie does get scary. Yes, there is some blood.  But to me this is justified.  If a movie isn't truly scary, then when the villain is defeated, there isn't a true triumph.  There's no sadness to make the happiness all the more precious.

The loose plot is the same--a widowed mouse needs to move her house to keep it from being run over by the plow with her bedridden son inside.  However, the Bluth film adds a whole level of nonsense, removing the most important scenes of the book--the scenes that gave the story its charm and believability--and threw in some absurd magical mumbo-jumbo, dressed the rats in little clothes, and generally messed up a story that was quite good on its own.  The result is a foolish and somewhat clumsy story made into a film that shares little of the spirit of the book it was inspired by.

That said, the film is ranks at or above the level of typical Disney films of that era.  The animation is top-notch, and Bluth's experience as a Disney animator shows in his good visual storytelling.  Because of the frequent use of backlighting as a special effect, it comes off a bit flashier than contemporary Disney films of the era.  Everything looks generally more sleek and polished (compare to Oliver and Company, The Black Cauldron, The Aristocats, and other '70s-'80s Disney).  In general the voice acting is good and not too heavy-handed, with Dom Delouise playing the only really memorable voice role: Jeremy the crow.  The plot also moves along at a good pace.

She's also a tiny field mouse who scrapes out a modest living for herself and her family among the other small animals who live in Farmer Fitzgibbons' field. Harder times have fallen upon the meek and selfless little mouse, however, as her youngest child, Timmy, has become ill with pneumonia just as the family is forced to find a new home before the farmer's plowing begins. Doing anything and everything in her power to help her son and discover a remedy for her moving woes, Mrs. Brisby visits an ingenious little mouse named Mr. Ages who provides her with medicine for Timmy. Unfortunately, the danger comes sooner than expected, and Mrs. Brisby must find a faster solution. At the suggestion of her friend and neighbor, Auntie Shrew, the desperate mother takes her plea to the Great Owl. This is a dangerous task indeed for a tiny little mouse, but Mrs. Brisby will stop at nothing for the welfare of her children. She survives the frightening experience only to be sent on another quest. The Great Owl informs her that she must seek out the wise, old Nicodemus, leader of the rats in the rosebush, for only they have the power to move her home; the rats of NIMH.

NIMH, the National Institute of Mental Health, is the key to all that Mrs. Brisby never knew about her late husband. Her experiences with the rats of NIMH, escapees from that awful place, will open her eyes to an entire world of secrets, science, and magic that she never could have imagined before. Most importantly, she will come to realize the power within herself. ""Courage of the heart is very rare; the stone has a power when it's there.""

When former Disney animator Don Bluth struck out on his own, he was unable to take the Disney ""magic"" with him. Despite the number of animated films to his credit since, most lack a certain special ""quality"" that sets them in league with the great works of the house that Walt built. This is not to say that many of his films aren't enjoyable. In fact, a few came rather close to that Disney excellence, and one such film shines above all the others: ""The Secret of NIMH."" In a time when fantasy films were all the rage, NIMH was the perfect animated feature, but what made this story so powerful and exceptional was the bold style in which Bluth chose to tell it. ""The Secret of NIMH"" makes no effort to be like a Disney film, nor does it attempt to be aggressively different. It simply uses its own style to create a world that suits the story perfectly. There is magic, but no fairy-godmothers or three wishes. The animals in NIMH live among modern day humans, but their own existence is very much medieval, with swords, wizards, and strange creatures around every corner. The film makes no apologies for depicting blood, death, and at least one use of the ""D"" word (I wasn't exactly counting). In fact, I'm quite surprised to see it listed as rated ""G"" on Amazon. I had thought it came out as a ""PG"" film, though I'm not certain. Regardless, the film is excellent for family viewing among parents and older kids; not too low-brow for adults, but full of humor, fun, and adventure for the younger set. The characters are striking and real, from the humble little Mrs. Brisby to her caring friends, to the dangerous creatures that lurk and plot around them. Dom DeLuise is unforgettable as the clumsy and confused Jeremy the crow, and the dramatic presence of greats like John Carradine, Hermione Baddeley, and Derek Jacobi is not unfelt. The animation is glorious, as one should expect from a former Disney animator, and the story's message about courage and love is conveyed flawlessly, but the real power of this film is invoked by the music. The hauntingly medieval-sounding score by Jerry Goldsmith will stay with you forever, even if Disney music is more your style (take it from me, a Disney fanatic), and Paul Williams' singing of ""Flying Dreams"" during the credits is equally enchanting.

The DVD is much less spectacular. The only real extra feature is the theatrical trailer, and the film is presented in fullscreen without having been remastered. Still, it's nice to replace the old VHS with a disc, even if the viewing experience is only slightly improved.  The DVD I have features the previous cover art, however it is my understanding that the art is the only thing that has changed with this newer release. Hopefully, this animated classic will receive a more comparable DVD release in the future. If you haven't seen ""The Secret of NIMH"" yet and consider yourself a fan of animation, you MUST pick it up. Outside the Disney Studios, American animation doesn't get much better than this!",1126742400,47,4699,4.685230024213075
406613,5,630197753X,"I cherish this movie; I saw it in the theater when I was 9 years old. I think now, why I was so affected by it, why to this day is it still so important to me, and my growing up as a person. I realize now that it's because of certain things, it's the quietness of the characters, the whispers, the dialogue in low keys, and it's the muted colors and the music. The subject matter of great sacrifice and a mothers love and strength appealed to me because I had lost my father to cancer when I was three and my mother raised the four of us girls under tremendous circumstances just like Miss Brisby. A mothers love for her children and for the memory of her dead husband is the stuff of novels and poems, not usually cartoons. The part in the movie where she goes to see the owl, who is a great danger to her, and she is afraid yet will stand her shaky ground to follow through with her quest is exactly what being a mother is all about. The Secret of NIMH is a classic, it is a beautiful story, and everyone must see it and share it with whomever they can.",1124323200,4,1055,4.052631578947368
406614,5,630197753X,"Considered by many to be the finest animated film made outside of the Disney banner, Don Bluth's The Secret Of NIMH (1982) was a welcome return to the classical style of animation when American cinema needed it most.  There was a near two-decade-long ""dry spell"" following Walt Disney's death in 1966 when the studio placed a greater priority on developing live-action films, and made extensive budgetary cutbacks to its animation departments.  Don Bluth and a dozen other animators grew so disenchanted that they left Disney in the late 70's to embark on their own projects.  NIMH was Bluth's first and most satisfying film.  Though at a domestic gross of $13 million, its initial theatrical release -- though not a failure as some have claimed -- was a significant commercial disappointment.  Dwarfed by the now legendary movie marketplace of the summer of '82 (with E.T., Star Trek II, Blade Runner, Conan The Barbarian, and Tootsie among them), NIMH also had the misfortune of a poor marketing campaign thanks to studio politics. Still suffering insurmountable losses from its Heaven's Gate debacle, United Artists had fathered NIMH before MGM bought out the company -- they, in turn, acquired control of the film.  Having little interest in an animated film of its own, and wanting to place greater emphasis on its ""tentpole"" release (Poltergiest), MGM dropped the ball, giving NIMH release little, if any, fanfare.

Yet The Secret of NIMH has endured over the years, thanks largely to television screenings and home video sales.  Ask anyone who was a child during the eighties, and they've likely seen and loved the film.  Based on Robert C. O'Brien's Newberry Award-winning novel, ""Mrs. Frisby And The Rats Of NIMH,"" the movie combines a dark yet awe-inspiring view of nature while adding fantasy elements. It's a rather liberal view of the book, true, but faithful in its spirit -- evoking the same feelings as Richard Adams' ""Watership Down.""  The images deliberately used the old fashioned style of animation, utilizing extremely detailed paintings with deep, vivid, dreamlike colors and rich blacks.  Expertly voiced by a fine cast (including the late Elizabeth Hartman as the widowed mother field mouse trying to save her family), NIMH still holds up against today's CGI-aided features. It still feels fresh, as it avoids many of Disney's usual traits -- NIMH's NOT a musical, and presents some rather intense scenes for a G-rated film.  Like The Wizard Of Oz or The Black Stallion, it is one of the few family films that adults may enjoy every bit as much if not more than younger audiences.  Jerry Goldsmith's score (his first for an animated film) remains one of his best.",1120521600,5,2687,5.024774774774775
406615,5,630197753X,"As a child, I watched The Secret of NIMH so many times that I wore down the tape and drove my parents crazy with each compulsive viewing. Oftentimes, my siblings and I and the neighborhood kids would get together at someone's house, watch it, and go outside afterwards to reenact parts of it or make up new story lines. It was the sort of movie that inspired you; it made you think. It made you want to be a part of it.

What makes The Secret of NIMH so powerful is that it doesn't talk down to kids or bore adults. It's style with substance--beautifully animated with great attention to detail (just watch and listen to that opening sequence in Mr. Ages' house!) and a moving, wonderful score. But most importantly, The Secret of NIMH is a smart, challenging movie that touches on great themes of love and sacrifice and intellectual awareness.

Mrs. Brisby is a simple field mouse who's fallen on hard times--her husband is dead, her son is ill and can't be moved, and there's a tractor heading straight for her house. After seeking advice from a huge, scary owl (a scene made all the more poignant because we're reminded that ""owls eat mice""), she sets out to find a colony of rats--the only living beings who can possibly help her out. The rats, made intelligent by a creepy experiment at the National Institute of Mental Health, are in the process of debating their future--and the idea that with enhanced intelligence comes moral responsibility. While the rats fight about realism and idealism, Mrs. Brisby--a field mouse, or ""lower creature"" as she is called by one of the rats--upstages them all with her intense devotion to her children and her unwavering bravery and willingness to do what's right.

Despite its beauty and entertainment value, the movie still has its flaws and plotholes, some of which pricked me even as a child. For instance, what exactly is ""the stone"" and how did it get its power? Why is Nicodemus alone endowed with special powers (such as telekinesis) while the rest of the rats have to settle for being just ""smart""? How do they manage to erase all vestiges of their existence and journey to Thorn Valley in a few hours? Does Mrs. Brisby have a first name--apart from Mrs. Jonathan? Aren't there any female rats around? Nicodemus is called the leader of the rats but we don't see him doing much leading--he's kind of a figurehead, and even Mrs. Brisby addresses him as ""your majesty.""

Plot holes aside, I'd recommend this movie for any child older than five or six, or for any adult along for the ride. It's a rare kind of kids' movie, one of a kind, and it leaves you wanting more when the credits roll across the screen. You'd be hard-pressed to find another animated film with this kind of intelligence and heart. I'd know--I've been looking my entire life.",1119744000,5,2795,4.651821862348178

406617,5,630197753X,"I first watched this movie was I was six years old, but since that day I was completely hooked. Now almost twelve years later I can watch this movie with the same enjoyment.

The secret Of N.I.H.M (stands for National Institute Of Mental Health) is one of Don Bluths better classics, (director of American tail, land before time)the animation is old, yes, but there is a surreal dark magical feel to it that enhances its effect. The story is not quite for children, and is often violent such as NIHM using the rats for tests and such. Although nothing is shown, an adult will understand the deeper meaning that went into the story.

If you've ever seen Bambi or Watership down,N.I.H.M is much like them, although containing a more lustrious magic spectrum that makes it one of a kind.

The characters are engaging, and the voice acting is superb. Peter Strauss and Dom Delous are so right in their various roles that one can't help but feel delighted with this movie. Peter Strauss plays Justin, who's good-looking in his own way and quite a swashbuckler. The end scene between him and the leader Genner is really cool even at this day and age, and the emotion is portrayed uncannily through it all. Dom De lous, well, frankly, who couldn't like him as the klutzy crow just looking for love?

One the whole this is a wonderful movie for more than just the children to enjoy. Take it from me.",1118102400,5,1391,4.57429718875502
406668,5,630197753X,"My nephew has discovered this movie, which has forever labeled, in my mind, actor Peter Strauss as ""Justin.""  Fun trivia: Strauss, currently appearing as a John Kerry-like president in ""XXX: State of the Union"" when he's not in Miracle-Gro commercials, named his son Justin after the heroic, brash, Captain Kirk-like rat.

And at the risk of being labeled a pervert, I had a crush on Justin when I was a girl.  How could you not?  His name fit him, the voice was fantastic, and he had a great sense of humor--appealing despite his shortsightedness about his rival Jenner, who seeks to rule a colony of genetically enhanced rats.  How genetically enhanced?  Dr. Julian Bashir of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" would feel right at home among them.

Like Bashir, and the monstrous Khan Noonien Singh from the original ""Star Trek,"" the rats run the gamut of personalities and moral character, from the duplicitous, cunning power-hungry Jenner, to Justin, to conflicted Jenner accomplice Sullivan, to...ah...the regal rat leader Nicodemus, voiced by Derek Jacobi.  My dad put it well: ""Justin's the soldier, Nicodemus is the statesman.""  Also, unlike in the book this wonderful story is based on, Nicodemus is a wizard.

Again, at the risk of being labeled strange, I also had a crush on Nicodemus.

All the rat wizardry and brilliance adds to the wonder, but the emotional heart of the film is Mrs. Brisby (Mrs. Frisby in the book), a widow seeking to move her family before humans tear up the farm field where she lives.  There's one problem: her son Timothy, an invalid, has pneumonia, and as the gruff herbalist Mr. Ages explains, Timmy can't be moved.  What's a mother to do, especially when there's a ferocious cat, a well-meaning comic lovesick crow, and a meddling shrew (literally!) all complicating and aiding her quest?  And just what does Mrs. B's deceased husband Jonathan have to do with the rats as well as the fearsome Great Owl?

I first was exposed to the movie through the graphic novel, wonderfully illustrated, and to a kid the Great Owl looked huge--of course, the drawing was from the perspective of a humble mouse.  Mrs. B's courage and determination in the face of incredible odds make her the perfect heroine, a Frodo seeking to do the right thing, aided by a magic talisman, and caught in a battle to keep the magic from falling into Jenner's hands.

Don Bluth, like Tim Burton, was a very talented artist and animator who broke away from Disney.  Both Burton and Bluth could not stand redrawing the same animation cells for other people all day long.  Burton found profit, Bluth, sadly, did not.  However, that is not to say that Bluth did not create some very fascinating films along the way.

This is a tale of wonder and imagination.  Watching this film is almost like seeing the equivalent of an American film with Miyazaki style and presentation.  If you have ever seen ""Spirited Away"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" there is an obvious similarity here between Miyazaki and Bluth.  However, Bluth is very much an American, as is the setting for this imaginative tale.

It is a tale of rats who were experimented on by humans, who became very intelligent, strange, and different as a result of what the humans had done to them.  Eventually, these creatures managed to escape their bondage from humans, and formed their own kingdom far out in the country.  This is the tale of Mrs. Brisby encountering this strange race of rats, but it is so much more.

Please check it out and experience one of the more unique animated films ever made.  This is not Disney, this is a new and different style.  Sadly, these films just didn't catch on with the 80's crowd and Bluth was forced to go underground and now, today, makes a living in the straight-to-video kid market (He churns out those Land Before Time sequels just about every month).",1090108800,5,1729,4.641447368421052

Those of you who are partial to the book will always have your criticisms.  I am personally impressed with the aspects of magical realism that Don Bluth portrays in this animated film. One also has to keep in mind that, in order to keep an animated film at a length that will engage a child's attention and imagination, the story cannot follow the book exactly.  If the story were followed exactly, the film would have been well over four hours long, and that would be for the first film...It would have to be done in a series like ""The Lord of the Rings"" (which still doesn't follow the books exactly...See my point?)
Yes, some characters were left out, yes, the plot itself changes quite a bit, but the integrity of the message the book conveys is maintained throughout Don Bluth's creation.
Beyond that, the art forms between novels and films are entirely different; that is why there is such a phrase as ""poetic license.""

The ending is truly magical and very powerful when Mrs. Brisby uses her stone (""which holds great power when used by one of courage"") to do what even the rats cannot.  A great tale of courage, and how you can do anything if you try.

Bottom line: Well-animated, well-lit, well-told, well-voiced.  As good as any movie can get, for adults or children!!!",1068076800,16,989,4.664739884393064

I don't think I have ever seen an American animated movie like this. This is proof that not all animated movies have to be about flashy animation, cheap musical sequences, and celebrity vocals. This movie is all about story and that's whats improtant. The animation is beautiful with unbelievably detailed backrounds and set designs. The characters are realistic and well performed. The only small issue with this movie is the content. It's a little graphic for a G-Rated movie such as needles being stuck inside the mice, characters being stabbed and bleeding, makes me wonder what was cut from the final version.

If you've read the novel that this movie is based on (Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH), you'll know that it isn't exactly spot-on in its minute accuracy. Some things are changed a bit, and others are left out, due to a simple lack of time to cover all of the details. Nevertheless, this is a fairly faithful translation of a great novel into animated form. The characters are endearing and well-acted, and the animation is of top-notch quality and detail.  I can't speak for the DVD, as I'm working off of my old VHS copy. The basic story is quite intact, though its execution has been ""spiced"" a bit in some places, so that it can hold the attention of a younger (or less patient) audience. The line between magic and science is a little blurry here, but I don't think that detracts from the film's quality at all.

The story is this: a widow fieldmouse needs to move her family before the plow comes. Her young son is ill, so she seeks the aid of mysterious, remarkably skilled rats who live in a rosebush. With their help, she learns the true magic and power of love.
For the most part, it was a thrill to see my favorite passages from the book brought to life, but a few changes surprised me: in the book, Brutus the Guard is described as a young rat, but the film depicts him as a hulking colossus, fiercely attacking Mrs. Brisby when she attempts to contact Nicodemus (the rats' leader). The film also adds an enchanted amulet, which requires a greater leap of faith to accept: at least the super-intelligent rats are explained by secret laboratory tests--are we to infer that NIMH was also experimenting with otherdimensional forces?
Don Bluth's animation imbues the characters with richness of expression and body language. Truly spectacular voice-over performances complete the illusion. I can't think of a better voice for Jeremy the Crow than the ever-talented Dom DeLouise!  Bonus trivia: listen carefully for a young Shannon Doherty.

The field that she lives in is about to be plowed over, and one of her children is very ill, and cannot be moved.

 This movie truly does have something for everyone.  Children will love the talking creatures, the ridiculous crow, Jeremy, (voiced with perfection by Dom DeLuise), and they'll recognize the overwhelming, self-sacrificing love Mrs. Brisby (the mother) displays for her family.  Adults will enjoy the more subtle humor as well as the message of pure love conquering all obstacles.  This movie (along with my role model mother) formed my image of how mothers should be: loving, strong and self-sacrificing.  Even when Mrs. Brisby if forced to face her deepest fears (an owl, the cat), she does it, not without fear, but to save her son's life.  This is a touching movie.
 Another point of appreciation for this movie is that it does not try to simply dumb things down for kids.  I like most  Disney movies but this aims a little higher.

There is a lot of profound thought in this movie, if you want to find it.  It is enjoyable for all ages.  Certainly is Don Bluth's best production (Too bad they weren't all this good).
Most of the very few negative comments that have been posted here have dealt with 1. the DVD isn't well done (certainly not the fault of the movie) or 2. that it isn't much like the book.  True, it isn't, but that doesn't take away from wonderful movie that it is.  I feel with this as with all movies, that the book and the movie have to be judged on their own merits, not in how they compare to each other. And this is a great movie.

Bambi isn't at all like the book, either, neither is the Little Mermaid, neither is the Hunchback of Notre Dame, neither is Aladdin, and all are fine movies.

I have a certain connection with this movie, as this was the first movie I ever saw in my entire life.  Even so, I've never forgotten it, and is one of my most prized movies in my collection.  Heck, I don't even have any gripe with telling people publically I love this movie.  Its just so truly tragic that this movie was so far ahead of its time.  Don't get me wrong, ET was a good movie, but releasing this masterpiece along side it was suicide. If only this movie had been given the breathing room it needed.  Nimh really didn't get the fame it truly deserved, but as the other reviews here speak for me, this movie has still made its impact, testament to just how incredible this thing could have been. An adaptation of a classic novel Mrs Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, it must be looked at as a take on it.  A few have critisized Secret as being so loosely based off the original book.  Please, lighten up, its a different, and very welcome take on the original story.  In all honesty, while it could have used a much more in depth flashback scene to the escape from Nimh like in the book, the movie had so much more personality than the book.  Mrs Frisby(Brisby in the movie, changed due to legal stuff with the Frisby toy, go fig)may have been a tough character, but she had almost no personality.  Mrs Brisby may not have been a bad girl, but she was strong inside, and just screamed with personality just layers deep.  She shows emotion, fear even, but does something that few characters do, they find their courage, which for most of us in real life isn't often simply gift wrapped, its something that must be found and turned to for strength. This is what I mean, the characters in this are very well fleshed out.  Justin is way more memorable than in the book for certain.  He is a true hero, who has his own shortcomings but opts to defeat them with honesty and dignity.  Nicodemus is a truly mystical figure who ofsets some of the movies greatest mysteries still debated today.  The Villain, Jenner, makes you wonder about how greed, and desperation to survive can corrupt any mind.  Even the children, who are often one dimentional in animation, make an impact. Martin is the very essense of the adventurous, tough minded yet stubborn, but at the same time really just a child on the inside persona that so many young boys often grip with.  So much to say, why you ask?  This is one of those movies that, while entertaining to children, only really starts shining when you watch it as a broad minded adult who can understand so many of the hidden concepts that carried over from the book, and were fleshed out with honest to god emotion in this movie.  I emplor you, to check this movie out if you haven't. If you have, give it the recognition it so desperatly deserves, make a website about it, draw a picture of your favorite character, anything.  No matter how old you are, there's a lot to learn from this movie.  Its truly Don Bluth's greatest work, even beyond An American Tail.  It really makes you understand how Don must have so much trouble trying to outdo this film.
Its even more tragic that its future, which could have been open and optimistic, has been made rather bleak with the horrendous insult of a sequel MGM had the nerve to make.  God, what wasted potential..but you never know, time goes on.  I truly wish the legacy of NIMH, and its many followers the best of luck.",1010102400,3,3576,4.396656534954407

It has been at least fifteen years since I had last seen it, and I enjoy it more than ever.
Bluth and close to two dozen Disney animators defected from Disney's studios in favour of having a chance to express and explore their artistic visions and creativity. One of their first animated films was ""The Secret of NIMH."" Other Bluth films include ""Anastasia,"" and ""An American Tail."" But no other animated film captures the sense of magic and wonder like ""The Secret of NIMH.""
Mrs. Brisby, a recently widowed field mouse, tries desperately to protect her invalid son Timothy from Moving Day, when the farmer's plough will destroy their underground home. She is led to a colony of superintelligent rats, ex-subjects of laboratory experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health. They are led by wise old Nicodemus, a friend of Mrs. Brisby's late husband Jonathan, also an escaped lab mouse from NIMH.
The somewhat dark tale does feature light-hearted comedic relief in the form of Jeremy, a trouble-prone young crow voiced by Dom Deluise. The story sticks fairly close to the book version, although several new elements are added and some side plots are cut due to time restraints. The artwork is breathtaking; vibrant backgrounds, clever special effects, the play of light and shadow. The characters are real and you quickly become attached to them. No one breaks into song every five minutes, although there is a very beautiful lullaby on the soundtrack that Mrs. Brisby sings to Timothy.
To me, this film is deeper, darker, and more imaginative than anything that Disney has produced. There are no fancy CGI effects, only the skilful work of animators that love what they do. The film carries a message of courage, love, and trust without being preachy or simple. There are plenty of tense, dark scenes, some of which might upset smaller children.

The only flaws are with the DVD itself, but I will not let that bog down the film's deserved five star rating.

the dvd itself has no special features other than subtitles and the original trailer but it neither adds or detracts from the viewing enjoyment. the small booklet included with the package has facts for young kids to read and learn about the animation process behind the movie.
one caution, the final conflict between two rats may be a bit graphic especially for very young children but i saw it at a very young age and did not think too much of it. i think it was good that the makers of this film kept to the original story rather than modifying it for strictly a younger audience.

Several of the younger kids were scared to death and crying, so make sure you're kids can handle some violence before you go out and buy it. However, it's an absolutely amazing animated feature. I was thrilled to see it available on DVD and bought it the first time I saw it. I watched it that night and it was just as good as I had remembered it. This is probably the only animated feature I've seen that stands up to the many wonderful Disney features.

It wasn't so much that it was technically advanced, but rather I was impressed the artistry. The animators were marvelous at expressing emotions and establishing the characters.
I'm not much on judging movies historically, but it's interesting to note its place in the evolution of animated films. It was done by a break-away animator from Disney, who left because Disney was going downhill. The quality of this film kicked Disney out of its malaise, and so is partly responsible for the many excellent animated film in more recent years.",997401600,2,842,4.854166666666667

But the truth is, Don Bluth found a great story and told it the best he could. It is different from the book, and thats alright. A person shouldn't set their standards that way. It is a very dramatic and heroic tale of some very small creatures trying to defeat something so large, that only something tremendous and exciting could pull them through.

This film, along with ""The Iron Giant,"" is hands down one of the best films ever made, animated or live action. It is so refreshingly different from anything else. Bluth wanted to hearken back to the days of classical animation, and this film indicates that he reached his goal. The voice cast roster seems to indicate that Bluth went for quality voices instead of big-name celebrities, and the result is nothing short of fantastic. The music score beautifully captures every mood, and is IMHO one of Jerry Goldsmith's very best. There is only one other animated film I know of that has a more exciting ending, and that is the end of ""The Fox and the Hound."" How unfortunate that such a disappointing sequel was made. Don Bluth should have been the only one with the right to touch the material. All in all, the original ""NIMH"" is a perfect film across the board.",987724800,2,963,4.4772727272727275

Set in the tradition of Disney animated movies (from where Mr. Bluth came), yet this film's flavor is a shade different. I would almost say more ""realistic"". Not to knock any Disney films (which  I love to watch), this movie deals with a problem set on a 'it could happen' level. No search for a Prince Charming here  -- just a person (mouse in the film) attempting to deal with the real world problem of how to relocate the Brisby family's home under emergency conditions when one of its members is too ill to move.
The story has charm and wit, and yes, even a bit of mortality thrown in. The art and animation are top notch, and the plot flows without a lot of irrelevant detail for padding.  Very young children may not follow exactly what message is being sent to the audience, however, they will probably enjoy the show all the same. For older viewers, most should be able to pick up on the theme of ""caring and self-sacrefice"" under difficult conditions.
Originally not a well-known movie, it has built up a cult following over the years. Yes, this one has a place in your video or DVD library -- especially if you have children.

The Secret of Nimh is easily his  best work, and will forever remain so. When he did this movie, he didn't  feel pressured by formula and created from the heart. It shows, too. With  this movie, we get expertly crafted and lavishly made animation, and this  was created before the days of fancy computer work. But we get more than  that. We also get a simple and charming story about a mother's quest to  save her son mixed in with a great adventure unlike any other. There is no  modern Disney stuff here. You'll find no bad jokes, and the humor is light.  The Secret of Nimh also wasn't afraid to show kids some of the darker  realities without going too far and scaring them. Okay. So maybe the story  is a little on the thin side and a few parts get rushed.

Still, you're  probably better off reading the book, unless you get a perverse thrill from  hearing the voices of a ten-year-old Shannen Doherty and an eleven-year-old  Wil Wheaton. * 1/2",961286400,3,543,4.923076923076923
407121,5,630197753X,"It's hard for me to write a review of ""The Secret of NIMH"", because it is quite simply one of most powerful and awe-inspiring film productions ever created.  Its dazzling animation and truly profound  storytelling defeats any attempt at trying to capture in words the magic it  performs in the hearts and minds of viewers.

 But, here goes.  Director  Don Bluth and his team of animators left Disney to start this production,  as a reaction against the steady abandonment by their former employers of  the classical art of animation for a more streamlined, cost-effective  approach.  As story material for this project, they enlisted the seminal  children's book ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH"", by Robert C.  O'Brien.  It details the story of a young widowed field mouse who, in order  to save her family from the dreaded farmer's plough, must throw in with a  cadre of rats who guard a miraculous secret: due to scientific experiements  undergone at the National Institute of Mental Health (the NIMH of the  title), they have been genetically altered to posess intelligence on par  with humans.  Stealing electricity from a nearby farmhouse, they have  formed their own underground civilization that they must ultimately abandon  as NIMH returns to eliminate them.

 While the film only uses the core  premise of the book as its foundation, it does something rarely seen in film adaptations by actually improving upon its literary source, adding a  mystical element that ends up telling a fuller and more visually dynamic  story.  And along with the revamped, Tolkienized plot are lovingly crafted  characterizations, creating a vibrant community of animal players who you truly begin to empathise with.  It's not often that a movie allows such emotional investment by viewers into the plight of its characters...NIMH  does this, and then some.

 And then, of course, we also have the  incredible artwork.  It is easy to see how dedicated Bluth is to  recapturing the lost days of lush, colourful, intricately detailed animation.  Every scene vibrates with visual content, whether it be a brilliantly  composed background or a breakneck action sequence, both of which NIMH does  in spades.  I've lost count how many times I've watched NIMH, but there  never fails to be chills running up and down my spine in certain scenes,  due to the devestating power of the images.

 Such a synthesis of  dramatic storytelling and miraculous visuals is something to be truly  cherished.  Unfortunately, when NIMH was released in 1982, it was knocked  aside by the release of Spielberg's E.T. juggernaut and has since been  relegated to cult status, revered by those lucky enough to have been  witness to one of the greatest animated features ever produced.  If you  want to refresh your spirt and mind, as well as watch a true practitioner  of classical animation out-Disney Disney itself,  surrender to the awesome  magic of NIMH today.",961200000,8,2930,5.054736842105263

407123,1,630197753X,"I can't believe it.
Robert C O Brien wrote a beautiful children's novela called Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.  IN it, characters rely on intelligence, thier own problem solving skills and each other to solve  their porblems.  In the movie, it's all solved by a magic amulet that  wasn't even in the book.  The origins of the rats of NIMH are completely  glossed over yet their plight makes for the most fascinating aspects of the  book!
Even little things are annoying. Why is she called Mrs. Brisby?  Why is Mr. Ages so bad tempered instead of the kind white mouse in the  book?  Why do Jeremy and the Shrew have such major roles?  Why is Jenner  vilified and made a baddie?  In the book he is shown to be a sympathetic  character who just had different beliefs from the rest.  He nad his friends  split away, amicably, only to meet in tragedy.
Where is the open endings  regarding the possibility of Justin's noble self sacrifice?
This movie  is the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in that it completely  betrays the spirit and intention of the novel. They cut tons of wonderful  character development and interaction in the book just to replace it with  silly scenes with the shrew and Jeremy.  O'Brien didn't feel the need to  patronize his readers so why should the makers of the film talk down to  their audience just because they're children?

The animation was  flawless, none of the computer enhanced anime movies we see today (not that  I don't like it, Beast Wars Rock! ) The characters have so much depth,  they actually have a past worth telling, a present worth sharing and a  future that my imagination tells me is going to be great.

Mrs Frisby, what a mouse!  if all of rodent kind  had the same kinda spunk she displays protecting her little ones, then  theyd be ruling the world, shes the kind of heroine that is a wonderful  role model, I hope we get to see a future prequel story that does her  justice. Jeremy (I think thats the crows name? ) Loved him, absolutely  adored him, gotta love Dom Deluise, still cracks me up. Nicodemus, what a  wise old, cool looking rat, Id be pretty intimidated if I saw him in some  dark alley crawling out of a sewer! .  Justin (I think thats his name), our  damsel/hero love interest dude, thats sweet like a once experimented on  guinnea rat (a rose maybe? ) Timothy, and the rest of her brood, the  shrew, the cat, the freaky looking Owl (gotta admire a mouse going into  that creepy tree, with a critter that looks at rodents like walking happy  meals! ), and of course the Baddie whose name I cant remember but he was a  real ratbag!

In the  process of saving her children from possible death at the hands of an  unknowing farmer, Mrs. Frisby - the mother rat - learns many secrets about  her spouse and the work at the lab.

407127,3,630197753X,"There is no arguing that the Secret of NIMH is a competent film with a strong music score and fantastic visuals, but one wonders that if America actually had a strong heritage of animation instead of a floundering history of so called classics with silly musical numbers where this film would stand. Clearly Bluth wanted something more serious, and he came as close as he was going to get with this film, then promptly abandoned it...and that is sometimes the way this film feels--sort of a footnote.
 Not terribly well thought out, even occasionally nonsensical, parts of the film are rushed, and short of a dashing errol flynn hero in the form of Justin, we have virtually no reason to sympathize with the rats who seem as greedy and self centered as the humans who made them. More so, the movie seems to wrap up about 30 minutes too early, and the ending that is provided feels so terribly cliched that children who enjoyed the book first will no doubt be dissapointed by the hollywood style finish.
Not that The Secret of NIMH is a bad film by any means, but it makes clear just how baddly the studios are in need of good story tellers. A look across the ocean at Miyazaki's Totoro, Kiki's and Mononoke demonstrate how good story can translate to film without compromise and degenerating to one-liners or musical numbers.
As things stand, this is still probably the best American animated film for kids, but it falls short from being the best possible, to which I blame those producers who felt that children (or anyone) need to be addressed with a 'greatest common demoninator' mentality, obvious examples being the dumbed down ending (the original story had no villians) and the portrayal of experimenters as evil animal torturers. There was a lot of room for something great with this film--the studio clearly cared (for once) abouth their product, and they had good material to work with, an excellent cast and good musical score.
