8472427,5,B005GYS8RC,"This one is a classic concert with many of the songs from Project Diva 1. It's 90 minutes long but features only the best songs of Miku at the time. The concert is usually called the Sapporo festival in case you want to YouTube it to sample it. Still, this is a great looking concert especially in 1080p. ALthough I would say that the Kansai concert is still the best, this was a great one because the venue was a little smaller and better choreography with the camera was achieved.
This is my third concert purchase from MIKU and I love it.",1438646400,,541,4.313725490196078
