5851435,5,B00DRQEU28,"Richard Pryor is one the funniest comiedians  of his time and to see him paired up with Gene Wilder it make it even funnier . The way they play off each other makes you laugh so hard at the situations they get themselves into. Also Richard being teamed up with a comidian great Jackie Gleason who in his own right could make anyone laugh , but put him with Richard Pryor and you have magic . The chemistry between the comes out on the screen and I would recommend this three pack to anyone who wants or needs a good laugh well worth it.",1411344000,3,536,4.153846153846154

5851437,5,B00DRQEU28,"Great set and bargain ""The Toy"" is funny but has a bad reputation for sensitive material. Jackie Gleason and Richard make an hilarious comedy act. But ""Stir Crazy"" and ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" are two of Richard and Gene's funniest team ups, too bad their other two films ""Silver Streak"" and ""Another You"" are not in this set.",1403308800,,329,4.5

5851460,5,B00DRQEU28,"""See no evil, hear no evil"" is one of my all time favorite comedies, ""stir crazy"" is really funny, and if you look past the heavy racial tones of ""the toy"" it has a good message in the end and then you feel ok about laughing. If you're a Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder fan, these 3 movies are a must! I'm in my 30's btw, so these are all older than me. But I can still appreciate comedic genius when it's presented, and it's hard to find better than Richard Pryor.",1476316800,2,463,4.043478260869565
5851461,5,B00DRQEU28,"These three movies of Richard Pryor triple features are great. No problem with these films. Richard Pryor a funny comedian and also Gene Wilder. I may not want to forget Jackie Gleason. Who was a great comedian. I may recommend this to family and friends who are a fan of Richard Pryor, Gene Wilder and Jackie Gleason.",1475625600,,318,4.5964912280701755

5851466,3,B00DRQEU28,"this review is about this new blu-ray set, not about the film's themselves
SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL, incredibly funny with Gene wilder & Richard pryor
STIR CRAZY & THE TOY also Great comedy classics
 have been given new HD transfers by Image entertainment
all 3 films were previously released as triple dvd set years ago by Image ent'
but the Digital remasters for each film looked pretty bad, still had some Grain & Dirt in the picture quality
but the sound quality was Dolby digital stereo
well Image have now reissued all 3 films with new 1080p 1:85:1 HD transfers
which do look excellent much better picture quality than the old Digital remaster transfers
i can't say the same for the sound quality for each film
in my opinion all 3 films should've been given new 5.1 master audio mixes
but Image didn't bother boosting the sound quality for blu-ray which is still the same Dolby digital stereo mix
from the old DVD Triple feature still sounds Good but not excellent, all 3 films Deserve better respect
and guess what no trailers for each film either, none of the original Theatrical trailers for each film have been added as extras
pretty Disgusting effort
as far as i'm concerned only the picture quality for all 3 films have been upgraded with new HD transfers that's it
the films Definitely deserve more respect no Doubt about it in terms of better sound quality boost
and the films original theatrical trailer's in HD
amazon are selling this for $14, what a ripoff considering there's no extras, each Disc is only worth couple dollars each
5 stars for each film, 2-3 stars for this new blu-ray triple feature",1470268800,4,1617,4.653846153846154
