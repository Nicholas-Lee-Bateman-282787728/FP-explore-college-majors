188737,5,1572522747,"This is a story of a small child who must learn to live again after the  tragic loss of her mother.  She must face her grief alone as her father  distances himself from her, expecting her to deal with it with the help of  her aunt and cousins.  The story is so well done that you feel her pain  right along side her.  I found myself calling to her to comfort her as her  mother would do.  She goes to the depths of despair, all the while  believing in the goodness of the Lord and the love of her mother, and that  is what saves her in the end.  I felt as though I had been through an  emotional wringer and had come out better for it, and my faith in the human  spirit was strengthened by the spirit of a little child. I loved it!

188767,5,1572522747,This  multi  award winning  French film is very hard  to  find on the internet on dvd. It deserves a  Criterion release. The story is simple. Ponette's  mother  has died. The entire film is about the way this very young child  deals  with the situation. To tell you any more would ruin the film for you.  The film's opening  is a tear jerker  and it never lets up  until the very end. One scene  towards  the finale  will  have you crying buckets. There has never been  a  more gut - wrenching  tear jerker  film in  cinema history.

I need not describe the movie as it has been done very thoroughly by other reviewers here, and in IMDB review links.  The movie gets 5 stars.  However, the DVD would benefit from a letterbox wide screen format and subtitles positioned in the black letterbox area.  Regardless, video is clear and audio is good.  As an aside, in a NY Times article Ms. Thivisol recalls her experience as pleasant and says it was, ""way better than school.""

Since the days of the magical film ""Forbidden games"" I had not watched such powerful and haunting film. (Even Victoire Thivisol keeps a close resmeblance with Brigitte Fossey).

188812,5,1572522747,"Some films are so raw and so real that they tend to break your heart more so than others.  `Ponette' is one of those films.

The film is pretty simple in scope.  Young Ponette is in a car accident with her mother.  She walks away with a broken arm, but her mother loses her life.  The film basically follows Ponette as she learns to grapple with the fact that she will never see her mother again.  She becomes rather reclusive and aggressive and defensive.  She fights her depression and her grief the only way she knows how.  She isn't yet old enough to learn balance and so she dwells in her pain and sorrow almost constantly.  Her young friends try to help her (sometimes) and the adults in her life try their best to console her, but in the end Ponette has to discover for herself just how to be happy.

I want to say this up front.  Some have criticized the depiction of Ponette's father in the film, stating that he is cruel for the way he reacts to Ponette's longing for her mother.  I don't agree with this.  I don't feel he was a cruel man at all.  He was emotionally crushed by the loss of his wife and the realization that he was going to have to raise this little girl all on his own.  He was angry with his wife for leaving him alone.  He missed her, he longed for her, but he knew that he couldn't show that because he had to be strong for Ponette.  It's only natural for the man to feel as though he must hide his feelings in order to take care of those around him.  If he were to grieve, who would console his daughter?  Sure, he snaps at her and calls her crazy, but this is out of frustration and not something he is proud of.

I completely understand that overwhelming feeling to `fix' everything.

This film, while simple, becomes so much more thanks to a stunning performance given by 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol.  Yes, I said 4-years-old!  In fact, this performance is SO good that I'm tempted to call it the best of the 90's.  Everything feels nature coming from her.  Every tear, every outburst, every solemn stare; you can't help but feel it in your gut.  Having a 3-year-old at home, I can see so much of her in this performance and so it speaks to my heart.

It's a performance you have to see to believe, honestly.

In the end, this is a film I highly recommend.  It is a French film, so be forewarned that there are subtitles (something that has NEVER bothered me, but I understand that it deters some) but the language spoken by this young girl's face breaks all barriers.  This is a beautifully moving film about the bond formed between mother and daughter and the strength it takes to `learn to be happy'.",1269561600,2,2638,4.313645621181263

188814,5,1572522747,"I thought considering the subject and the age of the child, it was an amazing performance, very realistic and touching.  It is understanding that a child does not comprehend the meaning of death so why should she accept it. The desire to see her mother brings also the acceptance of what has taken place.  The love obliterates any possible fear of the situation and the determination to make contact brings her inner happiness and she is at peace.  She portrays an extremely adult view and a very positive one.  I enjoyed this film very much. I can see why Victoire won the award for best actress.",1264723200,,597,4.60377358490566
188815,5,1572522747,"Have you or someone you've known lost parent when you were very young?  When death or divorce shakes up the world of a child it can be so confusing for a child-like mind to make sense of what has happened.  It's almost like our minds are made up of a long row of coat hooks.  Each hook represents an experience you've had and what you've learned from it.

Let's say you go the beach at noon in the summer without sunscreen.  You play in the sun for 2 hours. You're not surprised when you get sunburned.  When you start feeling your skin getting hot and painful you don't cry and wonder, ""what is happening to me?""  You already have a mental coat hook to hang that information on because it's probably happened to you before or to someone you know.

When a child loses a parent, if nothing like that has ever happened before, there is no coat hook to hang the information on.  The information seems to float around until a new coat hook gets created in your mind.  Maybe that child finally meets another child who lost a parent.  New coat hook:  I am not alone.  Or maybe that child hears an adult say something nice about the parent they lost. New coat hook:  My parent was nice.  Eventually as time passes the growing child may have experiences where, during a grief-stricken prayer, they feel that the Lord understands their pain and comforts them.  New coat hook:  It helps to pray.  God can comfort me when I am hurt.

I just watched this sweet movie, called Ponette, about a little girl who lost her mother.  It was comforting for me to watch this little girl's struggle to make sense of losing a parent.  I was her age when my father died, so her emotions, the off-handed comments and advice from her young peers (and the few adults in the film) was so familiar!  It made me realize how capable and determined children can be in making sense of their world, and how natural it can be for them to be drawn to God.

Other family members who watched it with me had never lost a parent, so the film seemed sad to them.  It didn't seem sad at all to me.  It was so comforting, refreshing and healing to watch; even funny at times.  New coat hook:  you're never to old to heal a little more.",1252886400,2,2191,4.306372549019608
188816,4,1572522747,"There are far, far too films made by and for adults, but created from a child's point of view. Other films of this type, and IMHO superior to this effort, are Jeux Interdit (Forbidden Games), Truffaut's L'Argent du Poche (Small Change), and of course, the same director's 400 Blows (interesting that these four are all French).  This is such a film. I can't call it a masterpiece, but it is certainly worth seeing, particularly by anyone who has a child.

I don't know how they got the performance they did from Victoire Thivisol, who apparently has the ability to release the waterworks at any moment. She was astonishing. Children have qualities such as forgiveness and resiliency that too many adults have either lost or have forgotten about. This tiny actress exhibits these qualities and many more, in spades.

I would recommend this film for families. Criticisms I would put forth are that there are far too many closeups--a tendency in today's cinema. Closeups once suggested powerful emotion, and were used sparingly; when they did appear, they had maximum impact. Now films are full of them, and to me, they are the sign of laziness on the part of the director. Also, the DVD is full-screen; the beauty of the French countryside would have been much better displayed in the wide-screen format.",1245110400,,1302,4.882352941176471

188821,5,1572522747,"I thought this film was beautiful in it's realism.  It accurately captured the way children think and act; their beliefs being amalgamations of the doctrines of their parents and their own ideals.  Of course those around Ponette do not know how to help her come to terms with her loss.  Some are definitely better than others at showing empathy.  After seeing the movie, though, I thought the adults portrayed did an excellent job of trying to show compassion.  Her father tries but has to deal with it himself, and thus isn't very successful (which seems realistic).

I tend to repress emotion while watching film.  Don't bother doing that in this one; you'll only end up with a headache like I did.",1181520000,2,700,4.735537190082645

As I watched the movie, I had the impression that director Jacques Doillon had simply found a real-life tragedy and somehow followed the participants through it with his camera.

188844,4,1572522747,"A straightforward look at death and grief through the eyes of a small child, Ponette isn't about false sentiment.  It is about how children see the world, and how they cannot understand the finality of death.  This rings especially true in Ponette's interactions with other children, her peers.  They cannot understand her loss, and their lack of sympathy is unforced and very natural.  The adults try to help but are so far removed from her and unable to remember themselves as children that they cannot understand her grief and denial.

But more then just about the inner life of a child and her grief it is about how we all deal with losses that no one but we ourselves can understand.  About the platitudes we are fed by people who've not made their own peace with mortality. About those who turn away because they fear thoughts of death.

And in the end, just as in Ponette; peace and understanding, when they come, are unique to the individual alone and not given in some fireworks filled denoument but in the slightest whisper.

Victoire Thivisol is simply brilliant.  Jacques Doillon is a master of his craft.",1129334400,13,1117,4.716494845360825
188845,5,1572522747,"I have agonized and agonized again over how to start a review of the French film ""Ponette."" Perhaps my difficulty stems from attempting to describe a film that falls outside my usual cinematic experiences. After all, a steady diet of slasher movies, out and out gorefests, and films dealing with the supernatural tend to erect certain barriers that can be daunting to circumnavigate. One should simply not look at ""Ponette"" in the same way one views ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Dead Alive,"" and any attempt to do so does a grave disservice to this magnificent experience. And it is an experience, a film unlike any I have ever seen in my long career of cinema watching. I can't even remember now how I came to see this movie, whether I saw a review somewhere and thought it worth watching or whether a friend recommended the movie to me with the hope that I would abandon the world of cheap and cheesy horror flicks. Well, I haven't given up watching bad movies; I don't think anything could make me give up my nasty little hobby, not even a film as sublime as ""Ponette."" But this movie certainly gave me a different perspective, that's for sure.

When we first meet the adorable four year old Ponette (Victoire Thivisol), we quickly learn she has gone through a rough patch. She's in a car with her father, arm in a sling, heading out to her aunt's house for an indefinite stay. The conversation between Ponette her dad (Xavier Beauvois) is terse and upsetting: the girl's mother (Marie Trintignant) had an automobile accident with her daughter in the car. While Ponette escaped serious injury--aside from the broken arm--the prognosis for mom doesn't look so good. The accident is far more serious than we initially thought, so serious in fact that our young heroine soon learns her mother has died from her injuries. But what does death mean to a four year old girl? How does a child with absolutely no experience of the wider world cope with the loss of a parent? These are the questions director Jacques Doillon tries to answer in this film. Ponette cannot rely on her grief stricken father, whose devastation is so total that he leaves his daughter with relatives and flees. Her aunt and the adults at school cannot do much to help, either. Instead, Ponette must rely on the assistance of her two cousins, Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz), and several kids at school to help her through her grief.

What is amazing about ""Ponette"" is the performance of little Victoire Thivisol as the distraught child. This is not a case of an older, cynical child playing a younger youth. Thivisol really is roughly four years old in the movie. A question for the ages is how Jacques Doillon managed to get this sort of performance out of a kid. How do you explain a complex sensation like the loss of a parent to a child who has never experienced such pain? Moreover, how do you do this and then get them to mirror it back for the camera? Beats me, but Thivisol somehow manages to convince the viewer that she's going through one of life's worst experiences. I think you'd have to go back to Tatum O'Neal to find an actress with similar abilities. Most child actors simply can't emote the way Thivisol does in this film. We're too familiar with kids in pictures who laugh, act up, or mug for the camera. There is no mugging here unless you count the shenanigans we see from some of the other kids in the film. The emotions seem real, natural and deeply disturbing as only reality can make them. The only way Thivisol's performance won't affect you is if you absolutely despise children.

After marveling at the profound range shown by Thivisol, I couldn't help but notice how the movie deals with loss and how human beings cope with such an emotion. The movie shows us scene after scene of Ponette seeking some truth that will explain what happened to her beloved mother and how she can bring her back to life. She goes to a young Jewish girl in her class, Ada (Leopoldine Serre), for help because someone told her Jews are closer to God. Aside from teaching Ponette how to talk to God--which involves serious tests on the playground that will likely make you smile--Ada's information doesn't really help. Information gleaned from adults about Christianity and its notions of the afterlife also provides Ponette with little in the way of concrete answers. Our heroine tries everything she knows, what she thinks of on her own and what others tell her, but nothing brings her mother back. Sadly, the movie sort of cops out at the end, but the journey to the conclusion is far more compelling. What the viewer quickly learns is that the questions asked by Ponette are questions adults ask in the same circumstances. We also question God's motivations and wish beyond hope that anything we do will bring our loved one back to life. There is almost no difference between what Ponette does and what adults do in similar situations.

A final element of the film that really moved me concerned the claustrophobic atmosphere of the set pieces. Director Doillon really gives us a sense that we're in a young girl's world through the use of close-ups, lots of interior shots, and the general inaccessibility to adults. Think back to your own childhood, when your world seemed so large but was really constricted to your home and neighborhood.

Seems like it was no plot at all- just the experiment on poor little girl how she will face the fact that her mother was killed in a car accident.

It was done like documental movie,it 's looks scary real story.

You "" enjoy "" to watch how poor little girl cryes, prays to God and loose her faith because He "" didn't hear"" her prayers , takes all kind of abusement , tests and cruelty from other kids just because they promise she will be able then to to talk with her mother ...

Why it was bad movie ?

Because I don't believe that little girl ""played"" it.

I think she truly believed in fact  her mother  died and camera secretly watched all her sobs and tears.

I have my  own daughters and I tell you that in this tender age ( 4-5 years old) they  can not lie like this , that can not cry like this unless it really HURT.

Also I didn't like that kids  shown had been basically by theirself 99%, they did whatever they wanted .

It was unpleasent conversations between them about boyfriends , and wrong touches.

This movie left very bad impression in me ,I suffered with that girl through peeking camera and could not help her at all.

Never ever recommend to anybody to watch!",1101427200,7,1347,4.158914728682171
188850,5,1572522747,"Four-year-old Victoire Thivisol--who looks as if she could have been the model for Renoir's ""Girl With a Watering Can""--gave such a moving, luminous, unaffected performance in the 1996 film ""Ponette"" that some critics accused writer-drector Jacques Doillon of child abuse. Certainly it's agonizing to watch Thivisol's tearful spasms of grief as the eponymous Ponette, a French nursery-school girl whose mother is killed in a car accident. But Thivisol's performance goes beyond realistic crying; the quiet expression on her face as she visits a chapel, trying to make direct contact with Jesus, would do credit to any adult actress. It's difficult to think of any child actor--with the possible exception of Jackie Coogan in ""The Kid,"" a full three-quarters of a century before--giving such a masterful performance at such an extremely tender age. Even Mary Badham in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--as good as she was, and as young as she was--didn't quite achieve the miraculous excellence that Thivisol does. (Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"" and Tina Majorino in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" were as brilliant as Thivisol, but they were also considerably older.) In his screenplay, Doillon demonstrates almost preternatural insight into ""Kidworld""--how children interact with each other, and how they try, with limited experience of the world and contradictory advice from adults, to make sense of life's mysteries and tragedies. And while Ponette's father (Xavier Beauvois) comes across as a jerk, unfortunately it's easy to believe that he--angry, grieving, no longer believing that life has any point--would behave so rudely to his tiny daughter. The film's ending, depending on your viewpoint, is either mawkishly unrealistic or heartrending and deeply satisfying (I take the latter view). ""Ponette"" is an unforgettable film with an unforgettable lead performance.",1098576000,9,1869,5.470588235294118
188851,5,1572522747,"This was an overwhelming film when I saw it in the theater. But how is it they formatted it for DVD while VHS is widescreen?! The people at Fox Lorbeer have screwed us again (see ""Wild Reeds""). Anyone who wants to format a DVD can do so for themelves with the click of a button. Outrageous.

As it is, this is what we've got for now, and it's unlikely there'll be another transfer anytime soon. French films of the last few decades have not fared well on region one DVD, with some of the greatest (""Sous le Soleil de Satan"", Lelouch's ""Les Miserables,"" and Tavernier's ""Beatrice"") never released.

""Ponette"" may not belong in that category, but it definitely belongs in the category of greatest films about children made for adults. Sweet and profound, Ponette will move even the most hardened heart with its tale of bereavement and grief. Victoire Thivosol is improbably emotive, and only occasionally saccharine. One of the great films about love, loss, and transfiguration in a magical, bucolic setting.",1091491200,3,1006,4.843023255813954

The result is magical, charming, funny, and at time, so sad that I found myself bawling.

188873,5,1572522747,"This is quite an amazing film; the lead actress is Victoire Thivosol (""Chocolat""--Anouk) who gives an award-winning performance at the tender age of 4 years old. She plays Ponette, the young daughter of a woman killed in an auto accident. Her father, unable to deal well with the loss himself, leaves Ponette at an aunt's and ultimately at a children's school. During the school days and the weekends with her cousins, Ponette deals with the horrendous loss. She seeks her own form of belief, and is bumped around by all the other children, who good-naturedly or not try to share their own beliefs and magic gestures to make sense of the world.
The ending doesn't please everyone but I liked it, especially for the cameo role played by Marie Trintignant. The camera angle is interesting throughout--tight and close and at child-level. We see the world up close and at Ponette's viewpoint, adding to the feeling of being overwhelmed and buffeted by life.
This film is well-deserving of the many awards it received and Victoire Thivisol is nothing short of amazing. Definitely see this one.",1087171200,19,1088,4.918478260869565
188874,5,1572522747,"One of the guys who works at a local video store that I frequent, when I asked about this film, said `It's probably the saddest film ever made.'  Whoa.  That's a pretty strong statement, and it further tweaked my curiosity.  When I finally got around to watching it, I could see where he was coming from - but there's a lot more to this fine piece of filmmaking than that.  This is definitely one of the most moving films I've ever seen - and the performance by 4 year-old actress Victoire Thivisol (who portrayed Anouk in CHOCOLAT so well, `later in her career') is absolutely stunning.  I saw the blurb on the cover touting her `best actress' award at the Vienna Film Festival for her work in PONETTE - it's easy to see why.
Written and directed by Jacques Doillon, PONETTE tells the story of a very young girl coming to terms with grief and death - hard enough for anyone, but her first experience centers on the death of her mother in a car accident.  Ponette was in the car as well - she wears a cast on her left arm for the entire film - so she has that trauma to deal with also.  Her father isn't around much - he leaves her in the care of her aunt Claire - and when he's with Ponette, he seems to have difficulty exercising empathy and understanding with her, which could easily be due to his own grief over the death of his wife.
With the help of her cousins, her aunt, a few understanding schoolmates, a very sensitive and kind teacher, and the strength of her own spirit, Ponette makes the journey to healing.  Getting conflicting advice on death and religion from several quarters, she searches for the path that resonates with truth within her.  The performance Victoire Thivisol turns in here will astound you - I can't recall ever seeing a child this young in a role so demanding do such a fine job.
The ending - to which some reviewers have taken exception - worked into the film nicely, I thought.  Much of an individual's objection to it (and I won't spoil it) has to do with his or her own beliefs and feelings - but I thought it fit the story here very well.
A minor note -- the information on this product page is a little confusing.  It says 'color/widescreen/Dolby', and then in the 'further details' page says 'full-screen' under 'features'.  The film is in full-screen format on the DVD -- but this certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment of it.
All in all - I can recommend this film VERY highly, but as another reviewer wisely advised, have a box of tissues handy.",1062979200,12,2496,4.413943355119826

true to life!

188877,5,1572522747,"Okay, I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said about Victoire Thivisol's performance: I'll just say that I agree that it is the most astounding ""acting"" I've ever seen, by far the most natural and heartbreaking ever captured on film, in my humble opinion. I was not surprised to hear about the controversy surrounding it, either. It is obvious that this little girl lived her character as no other actor has done (save possibly Bjork in ""Dancer in the Dark"") and I'm sure it was a harrowing experience for her. At the same time, though, that her suffering was, to some extent real, so were her emotions at the film's close. I have tremendous faith in the resiliency of a child with that kind of spirit. Besides, have you ever seen kids play ""pretend""? The fact is, they invest a lot more belief in their own fictions than we do, even on a daily basis.
The other thing I'd like to say is that I see in this film a scathing and none too subtle chastisement of the Catholic faith, and in particular what adults do to children when they assume a young, pure mind can somehow wrap itself around all that convoluted mess of fiction, mythology, shame, guilt and contradictions. Ponette goes to one after the other of the adults in her life for help, and each one delivers another religiously inspired diatribe on Jesus, heaven, the saints and letting go of her mother. Doillon cleverly uses the children to mimic the adults: when Ponette turns to her classmates for help, they invent spells and obstacle courses for her to go through-- something like jumping from rock to rock, and if you touch the mud you go to hell, or something similar. To be fair, though, Ponette's father, obviously an atheist, does her no better.
In the end, Ponette has to find her own way. And I do NOT think the end was a cop-out. I found it to be a beautiful, lyrical ending to Ponette's quest that delivered a powerful message about the love between a mother and her daughter, and the power and purity of a child's belief.",1046217600,,2005,4.526170798898072
188878,4,1572522747,"It seems nearly impossible to watch ""Ponette"" and not be completely spellbound at the conclusion of such an emotional roller coaster ride of a film. No other film that you see in your life will likely come even close to matching the uniqueness, emotion, strength, and amazing depth of this story. Before watching it, however, note that this is not merely a movie depicting natural human suffering; it is the heartbreaking plight of a child, a 4-year-old little girl whose situation may very well be something that few of us can claim to have actually experienced ourselves. Therefore, we are drawing ourselves in to this child's story and are learning an important lesson on human suffering from her. The emotions are formed beautifully and are strikingly accurate throughout the film, but be warned that you are not going to be able to look into this little girl's eyes without feeling your heart breaking and going completely out to her.
I doubt that any of us could say anything other than ""amazing"" when describing the acting job of four-year-old Victoire Thivisol in this movie. For having to play a child who has just lost her mother and is having her emotions almost completely rejected and ignored by the other people in her life, Thivisol turns in a performance that makes you wonder what children know that we don't. After seeing this film a few times, I have started to examine Thivisol's intense crying scenes a little closer. This isn't a child who's just yukking it up for the camera; look into those big, heartbroken eyes and see a little girl who has become her character to the maximum full, both inside and out. While this was basically the only way to help us get the best possible vision of what the child in the title role was feeling inside, it is also disturbing to see that kind of thick emotion from such a young child actress in a movie This is the only reason that I refrained from giving the film a full five stars; Thivisol's acting seemed just a tad too real. Still, I give this amazing little girl big-time credit for taking on such a complex and emotionally demanding role in such a deeply rooted film.
""Ponette"" is certainly a heartbreaker, but it ends with a strong enough degree of hope to prevent it from being completely depressing and unbearable. Through the pain of watching this child go through such trauma, you are drawn by her courage and inspired by her eventual ability to cope in a way that can ONLY be done and taught by a child.
Bottom line? It's emotionally pushing, but at the same time, you will not regret a single tear or grain of emotion that you have given to little Ponette.",1042243200,3,2630,4.6338329764453965
188879,5,1572522747,"I can't tell you how long I've waited to get my hands on this movie. After trying to order it twice and asking many times in the video store, I finally got it as a rental.
How refreshing it is to see how far a child's perspective and emotions can carry a film.
After seeing so many enormous reviews for this movie, I had huge expectations. I was not disappointed. It has an amazing way of taking a simple enough storyline, adding a whole lot of emotion and various characters with their own beliefs, and creating an incredible film that speaks directly where it needs to speak.
""Ponette"" has the immensely talented Victoire Thivisol carrying on the title role in the story of a four-year-old little girl. Traumatized after living through a car crash that killed her mother, Ponette is sadly forced to undergo more human pain and suffering than any child her age--or any grown human being, for that matter--normally should go through. Her emotions are thoroughly misunderstood by her estranged father and the other people in her life. While she is worlds apart from her cousins, her peers, and her entire family, she immediately clings to the idea that she can communicate with her mother and see her again. But with everyone around her giving her different viewpoints and various outlooks on God, it is often much more than this little girl can handle herself. Only through a very strong and important vision can Ponette finally discover a sense of peace and understanding and, most importantly, be able to go on living her young life.
Victoire Thivisol.......WOW! what is there to say about this tremendous little actress that has not already been said? She is absolutely incredible. This is not just a young actress--this is a four-year-old child kicking off her acting career with an extremely complex, emotional, and STARRING role. To get a child this young to do the kind of things that the script called the character to do is just unbelievable. After pulling off this kind of challenging role with such a natural and passionate ability, I'd have a hard time believing that there's any type of acting that Thivisol can't handle. As stated in the film, she is a true ""child of God"" with tremendous potential in the acting business. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't want to work with her after seeing her performance in such a hardcore, moving role.
With this being said, I have to warn you that you need to watch this film with an open heart, and not a mind with such high expectations. After hearing such good reviews, I expected this film to be the absolute most incredible piece of moviemaking in the world. Literally. You need to let go of all that and just absorb yourself in little Ponette's world. Watch it another time if you need to; only through a wide-open heart can you truly get as much out of this movie as possible.
The only part about the film that made me a little skeptical was the way Ponette's mother was presented. ""You are nutty but nice. Stop crying; stop complaining. I can't stand a crying child."" Somehow, through these words, she is almost telling her little daughter that her emotions and her ways of expressing them are unnatural and unacceptable. What kind of parent would say this to their four-year-old child who is under such emotional distress and does not understand why she can't be with her mother? It seems like Ponette's superiors are all oblivious to her pain and do not know how to help her, let alone simply allow her to grieve. I mean, come on--she's not feeling sorry for herself; she's in PAIN--deeper pain than some people never know in their whole lives.
Nonetheless, this is Ponette's story, and nobody else's. It allows her to share what SHE is going through and tell the story of how she, as a four-year-old child, is coping. It is an emotional headfirst plunge into her distraught life and her personal attempt to put her mother right in the center of a religion that will allow eternal interaction between her and the beloved parent she has lost. Maybe you'll cry, maybe you'll go and hug your mom, maybe you'll use what you learned to make your life better and more liveable. No matter how you react to this movie, however, you will most likely be genuinely touched and forever changed by Ponette's lesson. It's a film centered around children--very young children--but don't doubt their amazing ability to teach you. Children are, in certain ways, some of the best teachers out there. Ponette has a lesson to share that humankind is not meant to forget. Rent it...buy it...do whatever you can to make sure this movie makes it straight to your heart, because once you watch it, that's just where it will go.",1028937600,4,4668,4.714810281517748
188880,5,1572522747,"The central theme of the movie is how a 4 year old girl deals with the death of her mother. But as with most French movies, this movie is also about the celebration of life. Left to care for by her aunt, the story follows Ponette's trials and tribulations following her mother's death. Ponette goes through her friends, fantasy and religion in hoping that she will be reunited with her mother.
What brings this movie alive is the star of the movie, Victoire Thivisol who plays Ponette.  The range of emotions that she plays in this movie is mainly of frustration, anger, sadness and naivete. She plays the role brilliantly, sometimes you are left wondering whether the girl is acting or did her real-life mother actually died. Her talent is Oscar-worthy and would be envied by many actors and actresses in Hollywood.

One of the impressive roles played in Chocolat was that of the young daughter, Anouk, played excellently by Victoire Thivisol.
Due to her age I figured this was probably her first film.  But when I looked up her history, much to my surprise I see that she had already won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her role as Ponette in this movie!
I was impressed with the honesty of emotions between the children in this movie as Ponette slowly comes to terms with her mother's death.  The film follows Ponette through this painful process of loss, disbelief, belief, faith, and childhood perception of life, death, and the afterlife.
The film portrayed this process from a child's eyes extremely well and gives the rest of us pause for thought and reflection at times as well.  There are a couple of well done twists in the movie that are very effective (can't say more without giving too much away).
Though sad at times, the film ends on an upbeat note with a positive message.

The four-year-old actress, Victoire Thivosol, who plays Ponette, delivers a heart-breakingly real protrayal of a young girl reeling from her mother's recent death.  The  film forces you to imagine the pain of losing your mother at such a young  age and it inspires you to live your life to the fullest. The scene at the  end of the film where Ponette is visited by her mother brought me to tears  like no movie ever has.  I found myself weeping for this child and her loss  as if it were my own.  If you see one movie this year, see this one.  I  highly recommend it.",961632000,,624,4.339130434782609
188935,3,1572522747,"An avid viewer of foreign films, and a doting, sappy father of young daughters, I was expecting to love this movie, particularly in light of the stellar reviews it has garnered from others. Perhaps my expectations were  too high.
Ponette is a well crafted little film that does, as others  point out, succeed in presenting the children it portrays as unaffected and  genuine.  It contains a few moments of genuine sadness and gentle humor.  The young protagonist and her cousins are charming, and present realistic  glimpses of children's views on life and death. They do not seem to be  acting -- and that is no mean feat.
But technical prowess and loveable  cherubs do not a compelling movie make. The whole film -- up until the  penultimate scene in the graveyard -- is a series of vignettes that are  little more than observations.  We are allowed to act as unobtrusive  observers as Ponette mourns, her young friends dispense their varying forms  of childhood wisdom, and the children seek the talisman that will set their  world aright and reunite Ponette with her departed mother. Again, some of  these scenes are charming, but there is little in the way of narrative or  dramatic progression. By two thirds of the way through the film, the  dynamic is predictable and (dare I say) even a little boring. My wife (a  loving, tender-hearted mom herself) lost interest in the film well before  the end.
And then there is that penultimate scene, where Ponette is  reunited temporarily with her mother. I do not have a problem with that  plot element in the abstract (as some reviewers have), and I appreciate the  final message from that meeting (""She told me to learn to be  happy""). But the portrayal of the mother by Marie Trintignant felt  very out of place -- coarse and even grating -- when compared with the feel  of the rest of the film. It's hard to express propositionally, but that  performance just did not fit.
In sum, watching Ponette is a bit like  following around a group of 4-year-olds, listening to them grapple with the  meaning of life, death, and love for a couple hours. It was sporadically  charming, but lacked enough substance to sustain the entire film.  Perhaps  I would (and will) appreciate it more once my own young children have grown  out of their charming innocence, but I was surprised to find myself  disappointed by Ponette, and expecting more from such a lauded film.",961459200,6,2408,4.766990291262136

188939,5,1572522747,"Victoire Thivisol is very good, extraordinary really.  The breath and depth of the part she plays would challenge the greatest actresses.  She is also very beautiful.  She has beautiful eyes and thick, luxurious hair.  She was named best actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work  in this film.  She was then four-years-old.  Amazing.
But this is also a  tour de force for Director Jacques Doillon who, one can see, guided the  children to be actors, while they in turn taught him about their world.  The magic on the screen is the magic in the world of the children and what  they feel.  We see them cope with the existence they have been thrust into.  We watch as they struggle to make sense of it through experience, fantasy  and play.  We see how they learn to distinguish between what adults think  is real and what they themselves discover is real.  Her father is a  rationalist and feels that his daughter's prolonged sadness about her  mother's accidental death is ""crazy.""  He tells her he will not yell at her  if she stops acting crazy.  She wisely tells him she will.  Already she is  learning to placate the world and its madness; already we see that she is  working out what is ""crazy"" and what is not, and right now she is not sure  which is which.  Her father does not believe in a personal god, but the  women taking care of her do, and so do the other children.  She does not  know what to believe but she wants to believe in anything that will bring  her mother back or allow her to talk to her mother.
One may wonder how  Doillon was able to get the children to be so good.  It's clear he had to  immerse himself in their world and win their respect.  He had to listen to  them and remember what it was like to be a child.  These children are  creating their world, as all children are, right before our eyes, and  usually we do not see because we are so filled with our own lives and with  our preconceptions.  The children must learn the world and experience it  all for themselves, regardless of what we think.  Doillon shows us that  process through the eyes of the children and especially through the  extraordinary eyes of Victoire Thivisol, who will steal your heart and  soul, I promise.
There is something of the spirit of the lives of the  saints in this film of and about a child.  We see this in Ponette's  struggle to believe in a God who took her mother away and would not answer  her.  She is a saint as a little girl, and she is her very own doubting  Thomas.  But she does not give in to despair.  She talks to God and when  God does not answer, her rationalist streak takes hold and she demands to  know why He doesn't answer her.  When she is blamed by a mean little boy  for causing her mother's death, she doubts herself and wants to die.  Pretending is not enough for her.
Unlike some others I thought the ending  was good.  I think the problem was the way the latter part of the scene in  the graveyard was filmed with the false color, too hurriedly, and  (especially) the unconvincing performance of Marie Trintignant who played  her mother.
The final words of the film, ""She told me to learn to be  happy"" are at once great words of wisdom that we all might heed; but at the  same time these words are her first compromise with a profane world, in a  sense her first lie, her first ""sin.""  It is fitting that they were spoken  to her father with the underlying understanding that men will want you to  be happy and will be dissatisfied with you if you are not.  Her pleasing  little half smile from the car seat for him shows us that she has learned  she will have to put on a face for the world, and she will.  Nonetheless  one feels there will be a part of her that will remain hers alone.
This  is a beautiful, touching, and spiritually moving film, an original work of  art.",960422400,4,3838,4.321074964639321
188940,5,1572522747,"Victoire Thivisol is perhaps the youngest child ever to play the leading role in a film.  Sure, there are lots of films showing cute little babies  and children, but usually they have a walk on part. They are not the main  character. And, there are a number of wonderful child actors. But there has  never been a child who could act as well as this child.
I was mesmerized  by this film. First, Ponette looks so much like my granddaugher who was  four at the time, I could not take my eyes off her face. Second, because my  granddaughter was four, I had a good basis of comparison for four-year old  behavior. Third, I am sad to say that my granddaughter's father had died  recently and I had a basis for observing a child's reaction to the loss of  a parent.
I don't know why Victoire Thivisol didn't win every  conceivable award at the time ""Ponette"" was released. She is so  real, she is so loveable. You want to take her in your arms and hold her.  The interaction between Ponette and her father, Ponette and her Aunt,  Ponette and her cousins and school friends is truth itself.  At some  points, such as when the father stops the car on the road and lifts Ponette  onto the hood to talk to her face to face about her mother, I thought I was  watching reality.
Ponette has to be one of the best films about children  using child actors ever made. It doesn't matter whether you speak French or  can read English subtitles, you will understand Ponette.",960422400,4,1455,4.398496240601504

She makes it seem as if this  really was happening and the filmmakers had hidden cameras filming her.  It  is a wonderful film, which I can't rave enough about.

This might be due to the original's lack of budget  but I began to wonder when I see this classic movie is only pan and scan.

It's  a shame that we get such great movies done in substandard DVDs. Bowfinger  is going to be 16:9, Widescreen, and Pan&Scan; plus DTS sound &  lots of extras.

Here goes:
This award-winning French drama focuses on a four-year-old girl who is in a car accident with her mother. The mother is killed but the little girl only suffers a broken arm. Her distraught father works a job that entails a lot of travel, consequently as soon as she is out of the hospital, he parks her with a benevolent aunt and two lively cousins, who are about her age.

When Ponette sleeps she dreams about her mother, but is grieved to learn that she can't ""keep"" her when she awakens. This prompts MUCH discussion with well-meaning folks, both children and adults, about what happens when a person dies.

Little Victorie Thivisol, who plays our eponymous and much-loved heroine, tries to cobble together some semblance of meaning out of these various religious beliefs, but still grieves. She withdraws from everyone and tries chanting, praying, confronting her fears, taking risks, anything that might bring her mother back.

Director Jacques Doillon does brilliant work with children. There is only one fleeting moment on a school playground where one of the extras seems a bit self conscious, otherwise these little actors are flawless, the script is authentic, and our little Ponette demonstrates a wrenchingly strong character.

I've owned this French DVD (English captions) for years, so it must be available from the standard outlets; it certainly deserves a look. You can't go wrong!",1419206400,,1607,4.937037037037037
