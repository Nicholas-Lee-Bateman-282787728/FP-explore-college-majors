5021503,1,B006VUQIYA,"I couldn't make it all the way through this one. Danny Trejo is some kind of shaman with mystical healing powers (you can tell that from the poster, right?). Bad acting, weak direction.",1374105600,3,185,4.636363636363637
5021504,3,B006VUQIYA,"This is a strange movie. It starts out very depressing. It continues with some excitement that draws you in but it has a very strange ending that I did not understand. The main redeeming aspect of this movie is the female lead Krystal Vee, who is quite a beauty.",1366416000,7,262,4.36734693877551
5021505,3,B006VUQIYA,"I am not to sure about this movie I haven't finished it yet. I am kinda lost. I like Danny Trejo and GaryDaniels, but this is just plain strange.",1355011200,3,145,4.0344827586206895
5021506,1,B006VUQIYA,"No subtitles for those who want or need them. In fact, not even a menu -  just the play option or previews from the studio selling more of the same cheap productions. If you like cheap wood bead bracelets and necklaces and candles as your props then this movie is for you. Usual plot of Thai mercenaries led by some English speaking white bad guy (Gary Daniels) as they walk into a remote village and start shooting anything that moves while they look for a few females to sell in the sex trade. Danny Trejo in a stereotypic role as a Native or Hispanic with some touching healing powers. He touches a heavily eye scarred woman and the scars disappear; she suddenly sees and her response is ""Thank you"" in an emotional tone similar to someone thanking the waiter for bringing their order. People die and Trejo brings them back to life with a few dreamy dead walking around in paradise scenes. This other world special effect done by washing out the image.
Daniels in his usual stereotypic role as the bad guy as he chases down his stolen prostitution and drugs related money. Would you be surprised that he gets it in the end.",1334707200,3,1126,4.492682926829269
5021507,2,B006VUQIYA,"The is nothing like a ""bad"" Danny Trejo movie. And when I say ""bad"" I mean ""good."" Unfortunately this is just a bad Danny Trejo movie with no quotation marks. Danny plays an Eastern holy man/healer who likes flowers. He gets killed in the first scene, but unlike the movie, he doesn't completely die. He can't pass over because there is still work to do, so he occasionally resurrects and helps others along the way.

Danny is killed because his peaceful village, where young girls bathe topless in the stream, is raided by Gary Daniels to abduct girls for the sex trade. Meanwhile, John Edward Lee is getting ready to die and has a brief case full of money. He wants a woman. Together Danny and Lee fight against the bad guys (with some police help) to save Nana (Krystal Vee).

The film is rather boring. While there is killing, there are not any of the ""walking tall"" action one would expect in a Trejo film. This is far from a grindhouse, although it makes you think it started out as one. A rather lame role for Trejo in this weak action-drama. The film takes place in Pali, an imaginary Asian city/country near India. Might be an interesting film for Buddhists who are Trejo fans.

F-bomb, sexual situations, brief nudity.",1334361600,25,1228,4.572727272727272

5021511,2,B006VUQIYA,"Danny Trejo has never really been a top of the line actor but I tend to enjoy his movies anyway.  This is one that has me scratching my head.  First, who thought it would be a good idea to have him in this role?  It doesn't make sense.  Second, who allowed him to ""act""?  That also made no sense.  This was supposed to be an All-star cast.  I'm trying to figure out if there was anybody else in it that I should have known.

Better than two others I watched today but that's not saying anything.",1484784000,2,495,4.083333333333333

But if you are like some of the other people that have views molded by the marketing gurus of the U.S. then you will probably feel this movie is a waste of time.

5021546,4,B006VUQIYA,"Although this film was a little strange I enjoyed it.  It proposes a theory of resurrection and explores it throughout several scenes.  This theory is then interwoven with the dominant theme of the violent sex trade in Pali (Thailand), as well as the theme of a young man falling in love for the first time and then dying. I think this interweaving was well done, even though it did produce some ""boring"" moments.  I thought the acting was well done all around.",1468454400,,461,4.597560975609756

Bad acting (sorry Danny Trejo). Redo the film. Make Danny the bad guy. He's good at that. Take away all the sappy stuff and make it a real kick ass film.

Surprise, a ""Science Fiction, Drama, Action"" film can be Art Film. If you must read the spec. try -- ""Art and Popular Culture"", Chapter Art Film.

From a perch away from ""The Replacement Killers"" and that big guy with a huge knife painting the walls red with blood ask what is death and if death has special rules for some people. Does love matter? Are the path's of the two characters being steered buy fate?

Opening: The raider comes into the village for women to resupply brothel and slave trade -- plus anything else. The healer (Trejo) is ""IN"" and  a line has formed. The healer is using the gift to restore eyesight to a grandmother and he sees the event; ""his death"".  The top/down camera work plus ground level camera pan with long zoom give scenes depth. Supernatural label fit? Sure. I'll call a line of dead people walking across water to somewhere that term.

What I like about the healer is the problem of a healer who cannot die, he needs to die so he can be with his dead wife. The clues to how healer  Art Film expects you to keep up. There are action scenes and fighting, and cop on the trail of the raider.  The DVD for this film is a good idea.",1452470400,,1476,4.856573705179283

The perceptual dissonance of that fierce face and demeanor recruited to play such a sensitive character is fascinating to watch.  Other than that, this film feels like it's missing a huge chunk of backstory. Yes, it's called the Lazarus Papers, but nowhere in the movie is there a clue as to what those papers are referring to.  The script is badly written IMHO  and the actors seem a little perplexed as to where or why the story is going where it goes--which is all over the place. Sometimes you feel you've got a bead on it, and then some other new element comes in a topples your conclusions.  But it's not a challenge to watch (like Cloud Atlas, or Vanilla Sky), it's just not got any guts to it--as though the movie was about the making of another movie.  Again, this would be 1 or 2 stars, but Trejo is the diamond in the rough here, which got me to it being ""OK""....",1435968000,,964,4.3277777777777775

The plot looked interesting but couldn't make it past the first ten minutes to find out what really happens.  If you like this sort of thing, there was violence, nudity, lines of what looked like Thai or Cambodian or Laotian, or some Southeast Asian people lining up to see the horrible looking ""savior"" Danny Trejo, weapons, military trucks, and an evil white guy.  All in 10 minutes.  I don't think I would have watched this even if I was deployed  to Antarctica and this was the only movie I could watch the whole year.

The only way he could rejoin his wife was to find someone willing to live and heal in his place.  It was no academy award winner, but  I thought it was entertaining and a bit thought provoking.  It was also quite diffrent from the other roles i have seen him in.",1404777600,,404,4.333333333333333
5021753,4,B006VUQIYA,A strange movie would be this one. We have a Sharma who would not die. The second character is a killer who is running away from a mob boss. The third part was a young man who is dying but does not want to die by himself. Mix this together and you find yourself what is going to happen next.

5021756,4,B006VUQIYA,"This movie is not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The ugliness of sex trafficking, drugs, abuse and murder as well as the redeeming qualities of love, life, generosity and healing.

5021757,2,B006VUQIYA,"The plot line wound all over the place, for me it was hard to follow. Action scenes were infrequent, and there wasn't any memorable story or dialog to tie them together.

5021759,5,B006VUQIYA,"Yes, Danny Trejo usually does the over the top violence movies, guns and blades and chainsaws blazing, but in this film, he brings to life the meaning of life itself, which is love.  The love between people, and the love that can become twisted at times.  But in the end, the movie shows that by allowing real love to live in your heart, even though there is pain and suffering in life, you can truly live.

The acting may seem a bit forced, or not quite right, but that was due to trying to cram what lead the people to the places they ended up, and show how ever slightly how they got twisted, or straightened out.

I initially watched this movie because it was free with Prime, but after watching it, I then purchased it as well.  It is a truly moving film, and while not everyone will see or understand it, I feel it is well worth seeing and owning.",1401062400,2,853,4.2407407407407405

Or where Bai Ling was a transvestite, would be a comic gem but it was not to be.  The story fell as flat as Danny Trejo on the pavement.  Along with some really big holes in the plot, and no surprises, I wanted to give the movie 2.5 stars but I felt sympathetic and rounded up.

5021763,4,B006VUQIYA,"I can watch this film over and over for the emotional effect alone.  I feel most are over critical with their reviews.  And commenting on the props without taking them into account with the entire set direction proves they didn't watch the movie for what it was.  The struggle of living a peaceful life without exploitation, genuine love between unsuspecting business partners and vindication for a girl who lost her mother.  Also, the spiritual aspect of this film was a subtle addition to an emotionally touching story.
Very Requiem for a Dream meets The Fall.  Two great films.",1398643200,,580,4.877551020408164

5021765,4,B006VUQIYA,"Watching these movies starring Mr. Trejo and knowing that he prefers to be killed off, this one was quite a surprise. When he gets killed off the first time within about 15 minutes from the start of the movie, I figured that it was yet another ""cameo"" role for him.  However, I was happy to see that he not only appears many times through out the movie, he gets to be killed off several times!  It centers around Nana and Lonnie, who meet after Nana was kidnapped and held in the sex trade and is HIV positive and makes her escape. Lonnie is literally in his final days of life and neither wants to die alone.  Of course they are the romantic interests in this film.  Sebastian Riker (Gary Daniels) is the arch villain, evil to the core (why are the villains now all from the UK or Australia?), with Bai Ling as the evil and perverted ""madam"" of the operation who actually is  ""Mister"" as in the movie ""Transamerica"" or ""The Crying Game"". Also, I was quite surprised to see a young man that appeared to be a dead ringer for Forrest Whitaker but without the left-sided micro-opthalmia (a smaller eye).  Turned out it was Damon Whitaker and must be related. He did an excellent job. It has some beautiful settings, and amazing scenery, and the story is very endearing and heart-warming without being too blood-spattering.  This one will go in the ""Trejo"" collection for multiple watchings. Although this was no ""star wars"" or ""Schindler's List"" I believe it deserves a 4 star rating because it was a good story and held my interest.  Also, it proved that no matter how old Mr. Trejo gets, he'll still look good even with gray streaks in his hair and a gray mustache!",1398470400,,1664,4.504983388704319
5021766,2,B006VUQIYA,"When it comes down to it the movie is about Redemption and those who turn to the right path see an afterlife. Its a so s movie, but since I watched the whole thing I will give it two stars. Its about a Dying Man, A Prostitute with AIDS (Forced into it), an Brutal killer and a Spiritual Healing who wants to move on to be with his love in the after after.
