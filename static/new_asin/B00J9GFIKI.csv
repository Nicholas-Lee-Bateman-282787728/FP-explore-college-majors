8648995,4,B00J9GFIKI,"I have the Region B (locked) U.K. release which is presumably identical except for the subtitle options. It is fortunate this Hong Kong Region A release exists for North Americans so they can enjoy this film on Blu-ray without requiring them to own an all-region or region-free Blu-ray player. The Blu-ray transfer is quite good. The dialogue is French (only; no dubbed sound tracks) with subtitles. Those not fluent in French will need to pay attention as both dialogue and actor body language are quite important - demanding more than casual viewing. I found the subtitles to be a good translation as I do understand some basic French and it captures the mood well (i.e. it's not a purely literal one that would lose mood, emotion and feeling).

This is most definitely NOT a ""family"" film given that its story is based on the Austrian Leopold von Sacher-Masoch 1870 novella of the same name. He is the namesake of ""masochism"" which is obviously the underlying theme as the film progresses. It is definitely a hard ""R"" but not from some of the occasional cursing, nor due to any graphic sexual content as there is no exposed nudity. It's the masochistic gratification subject material in the clearly erotically charged dialogue and body language. This makes it quite decidedly an ""adult"" movie.

The compelling power of this film is in the interaction between a stage director and an actress that shows up quite late to audition for the lead role in his play, a stage adaptation he has written of Sacher-Masoch's novella. She convinces him to read the script with her and grant an audition in spite of being late past the time when he had planned to leave for the day. Their role playing gradually devolves from (very well-played) switching in and out of character to actress and director as the reading progresses until it begins to blur. The unpredictability of this and where it will ultimately lead is captivating to a final and (for me) unexpected twist at the end. It's one that has enough ambiguity about the two characters' personalities, emotions and motives that it begs multiple viewings of the entire movie. I've no doubt Polanski did this deliberately to leave interpretation of it to the audience. Four stars as it's not Polanski's ""best"" film but it is certainly near the top of his better ones, well deserving of the awards and award nominations it has received.",1421366400,,2380,4.830882352941177
8648996,5,B00J9GFIKI,"For those concerned about a purchase of this film from Hong Kong: I purchased it from Cutting Edge.  Playback is no problem and the image is pristine Blu-Ray quality.  This is not a knock off, don't be put off by the Chinese lettering on the box.  I purchased it from Hong Kong because I enjoyed the film so much I had to have it on disc asap.  The price was reasonable and delivery was much faster than I expected.",1411516800,2,415,4.215189873417722
8648997,4,B00J9GFIKI,"This is a film adaptation of the David Ives 2010 stage play, which in turn was based on the 1870 novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.

This is a specialty interest French language movie (English subtitles).

What is it about? The director of a stage play is conducting auditions: he laments the lack of a suitable leading lady, as he prepares to go home for the day. Into the theater walks an actor who is late for her audition....

The focus is on the interaction between the actor and the director, in real life as well as playing the characters in the play as part of the audition. Their interactions are intense and fascinating. There are undercurrents of sexual tension, power and control.

Making a film with two actors and one set for the entire 96 minutes is a challenge. Roman Polanski and his cast achieve this successfully- delivering a compelling tale with engaging performances, as the characters challenge each other.

Note: this film is not for everyone- it is in French with subtitles, and the focus is on the dialogue between the two actors.

For those who enjoy this genre, and/or the works of Mr Polanski, it is rewarding.",1408233600,2,1140,4.703517587939698
8648998,5,B00J9GFIKI,"This is from veteran director Roman Polanski and is rather a simple story. We meet Thomas (Mathieu Amalric - `The Grand Budapest Hotel' and `Quantum of Solace') who is putting on an adaptation of a play about sado masochism in its highest arty form. He can't cast the main character and has given up for the day as all the wannabe's are useless.

Then in walks Vanda played by the superb Emmanuelle Seigner; she at first comes across as a bit inept and unprepared. But slowly she reveals more and more depth to herself and the character she is to play.

She convinces him to read for her and they start going through the play analysing all of the nuances - especially the sexual connotations. Then fiction starts to blur with reality as they both immerse themselves in their characters.

This is like a stage play and indeed has been adapted from one - there are only the two characters and the whole thing takes place inside the theatre. However, it is absolutely engrossing both actors put in mesmerising performances and the sexual tension is palpable throughout as is the intrigue. In French with very god subtitles this is an absolute gem which I can wholeheartedly recommend.",1406937600,2,1181,4.695652173913044
8648999,4,B00J9GFIKI,HELLO I just watched this film and  I really liked it. I didn't know it was an adaption of a play. All this time I thought LOU REED made up the song title. The last fifteen minutes were really good. It might be too artsy for some but I did enjoy it. Check it out if you're looking for something different. thanks dennis,1403827200,,319,4.063492063492063

8649001,4,B00J9GFIKI,"""Venus In Fur"" (2013 release from France; 96 min.) is the latest movie from Roman Polanski. The movie is an adaptation of the award-winning play Venus in Fur by David Ives, itself an adaptation of the infamous 1870 's&m' novel Venus in Furs by Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. As the movie opens, we see Thomas (played by Mathieu Amalric) alone in a theatre in Paris and lamenting to his wife on the phone how badly the auditions have gone that day for the female lead role of his play. Then a woman arrives at the theatre, intending to audition of the play but too late. She tries to nevertheless convince Thomas to give her a shot and reluctantly he agrees. We learn that her name is Vanda (played by Emmanuelle Seigner, a/k/a Mrs. Polanski in real life), and by chance the play's lead female is also named Vanda. As she starts her audition, Vanda hits it out of the park and completely impresses Thomas. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: when the movie started, I was somewhat skeptical about it as I realized that this was a very literal adoption of a theatre play: the entire movie plays out (in real time it seems) at the audition in the theatre, and there are only 2 performers in the entire movie. Then a funny thing happened: once we have come to know the two lead characters, they start moving in and out of their respective character, at certain points playing their real selves, at others points their stage character, and yet at other times eqch other's stage character, so that what starts out as a seeming potentially dull stage adoption movie, now becomes a fascinating study of multiples characters. As to the 's&m' aspects of the original 1870 book from which the stage play takes inspiration, they are actually kept to a minimum and are not a major element in the movie from a sexual perspective (the domineering takes place at the mind level). Kudos to the two performers, in particular Mathieu Amalric as Thomas, he simply blew me away.

In all, this movie turned out to be quite the unexpected surprise for me. I saw this movie during a family visit to Belgium back in November, 2013, and given that this is directed by Polanski and the good buzz this picked up at its premiere earlier this year at the Cannes film festival, one would hope it is only a matter of time before this is released at art-house theatres in the US. ""Venus In Fur"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1396137600,9,2544,4.5524017467248905
