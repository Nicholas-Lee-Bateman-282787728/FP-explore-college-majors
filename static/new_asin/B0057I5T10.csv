4596623,3,B0057I5T10,"I already wrote a review of Repeaters some time ago [...]. At the time, the DVD wasn't even available on the US Amazon, just the Canadian. After all, Repeaters IS a Canadian flick :)

Well, Repeaters is like Groundhog Day. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day or know nothing about it...I would suggest you see that before watching this. It may ruin the experience of Repeaters a little...but Groundhog Day IS required watching. [...]

However, instead of Bill Murray, we have three dysfunctional twenty-somethings. All of whom are recovering addicts. And much like Groundhog Day, the movie asks us to wonder what we would do if we didn't have to answer for any of our actions the next day. What if, no matter what you did, good or bad, the slate would be wiped clean at the end of the day?

There's a lot to play with there and Repeaters DOES explore a few of the more fun aspects of repeating the same day over and over. But I'm talking about the dark kind of fun, not the family friendly type. The actors portraying the main characters didn't really move me in any way, but I still found the movie itself entertaining.

I would suggest it for a quick watch. If nothing else, it will at least mildly entertain you and give you something to think about or discuss...and that's all we really want in the end ain't it? :)",1330300800,,1317,4.475

After being cooped up for three months they get to go out into the world and make amends. Our trio has difficulty doing it. Kyle's sister refuses to listen to Kyle. Sonia has major league daddy issues and Mike's father who is behind bars because of him is less than a forgiving person.

The next day, our threesome realizes they are in Groundhog Day as the day keeps repeating. Mike wants to behave as a criminal, knowing all his sins will be erased the next day. The other two indulge him at first, but then to Mike's dismay want to seek a path of forgiveness and redemption.

Unfortunately I have seen Groundhog Day so the repeat aspect got old real fast. The story line had barely enough plot to keep me interested. It was too much like a Lifetime drama.

8460741,5,B0057I5T10,"I love this movie.  It is an excellent tool to use for addiction, behavior management/modification, trauma, and decision-making.  Aside from the supernatural element and some visual imagery which might be confusing for some people, the message is very clear, one lives with the decisions he/she makes and the outcomes/consequences of those decisions.  Teaching others to learn the importance of weighing good vs. bad and to listen to your conscience, develop empathy, and work toward overcoming trauma are great reasons to screen this movie for your audience.  Additionally, the movie is entertaining and will easily grab the attention of those watching it.",1373587200,,657,5.475247524752476
8460742,3,B0057I5T10,"Whoda thunk ""Groundhog Day"" would have spawned so many wannabes? I suppose, like 'found footage' movies, it's become a genre unto itself. This is an Okay entry.

Here's the scoop. You meet three friends in drug rehab one morning, during breakfast, in the facility's dining hall. They are at a point in their rehab where they need to find the people they'd hurt the most in their dark days and make amends. Things don't go well for any of them. Later that night all three receive electric shocks during a storm. They awake the next day to realize it's a repeat of the previous day. Now they explore each day with little regard to their actions knowing it will all wash away. This works for a bit but their individual personalities begin to divide them as to how to use this time and even get out. Therein lies the rub.

This is a steady but somehow lacking film. I guess it bothered me that people who are trying so hard to straighten out their lives would so quickly revert backward when the idea of consequence is removed. The one of the group, Weeks (looking disturbingly like a young Robert DeNiro), is a real prize. Drugs were fine before. Now murder and torture are A-Okay in his book. The other two, Kyle and Sonia, after a slight back-sliding, get to realize the gravity of the situation and go to lengths to both set things right and hopefully get back on the calendar. Things move logically enough but it effected my brain more than my heart. It needed something in the script to become more involving.

There was nothing really bad here. It was acted, shot and directed well enough. I just kind of shrugged my shoulders when it was all over. Not at all a bad watch. Just needed a bit more something to put it over the top.",1372291200,4,1732,4.440251572327044
8460743,3,B0057I5T10,"Repeaters (Carl Bessai, 2010)

The whole time I was watching Repeaters, though it did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, I kept wondering why Carl Bessai's name sounded familiar. After the movie, I pulled him up on IMDB and found I'd seen one of his movies previously--Severed: Forest of the Dead, which was a good deal more enjoyable than it had any right to be. The same could be said of Repeaters.

Plot: we open in a rehab clinic, with the usual assortment of idiots, jerks, and the occasional decent person who went wrong. Three of the non-jerks, Kyle Halsted (Slither's Dustin Milligan), Sonia Logan (The Haunting in Connecticut's Amanda Crew), and Michael Weeks (Crossed's Richard de Klerk), have formed a loose bond against the jerk contingent. In the opening sequences, we see everyone in group, and group leader Bob (Benjamin Ratner, returning from Severed) instructs his charges that today is the day they will go out in to the world, find the person they feel they most hurt with their addictions, and beg forgiveness. (Depending on to whom you talk, that's either step eight or step nine.) The day goes just about as you expect. Kyle attempts to connect with his younger sister Charlotte (Fido's Alexia Fast), gets blown off, and is told by his former high school principal to get off the grounds or the cops will be called. Michael heads for jail to see his father (Watchmen's John Tench), and it's good there's plexiglass between them. Sonia, too, goes to see her dying father (The Core's Hrothgar Matthews), and while it's a bust, it's still the most successful of the three. They go back to rehab, share their experiences, etc. That night, there's a nasty electrical storm, and all three of our principals are shocked through various agents. When they wake up the next morning...it's not the next morning. It's Wednesday again, and the three of them soon realize that they are reliving the same day over... and over... and over..., and soon they begin exploring the implications.

Yes, I know exactly what you're thinking right now, in that horrible Lifetime Original Movie way. I was thinking the same thing while I was watching it, and was actually half-prepared to give the movie a rotten review based on my being almost certain it was going to go in that direction. It is a credit to Bessai, as well as a testament to how much he grew as a filmmaker in the four years between Severed and Repeaters, that yes, the movie does go in that direction at the end (sorry for the spoiler!), but by that time, Bessai and screenwriter Arne Olsen (All Dogs Go to Heaven 2) have loaded the climax with so much of these three characters' personal baggage that going in that direction not only makes perfect sense but almost--almost!--doesn't feel like the crappy, overwrought clich that it is. I'll put it this way, it's not Lifetime Original Movie, it's at least ABC Movie of the Week back when ABC Movie of the Week actually meant something. Olsen obviously spent a great deal of time thinking about the implications; I certainly can't say I've seen every Groundhog Day-style movie out there, but so many of them play the situation for comic relief that the darker side rarely gets any play. Olsen worked that vein as hard as he could, and he did it well. This isn't timeless cinema by any means; no one here is a great actor, though all are competent, and Bessai is a fine genre director, but no one will be mistaking him for Bela Tarr or Werner Herzog anytime soon. But if you're looking for a slick, well-written, satisfying genre flick, you probably overlooked Repeaters the first time around. You should give it a look now. ***",1362528000,2,3649,4.707355242566511
8460744,5,B0057I5T10,"The ninth step in recovery is apologizing to all those you've hurt with your drug addiction. When three members of a rehab group fail to complete this step, they are met with a strange consequence. For them, the day they were supposed to complete the ninth step keeps repeating. Movies like Repeaters, are why I watch independent films. I'd never heard of the film, the cast, or the Director, and in fact, this movie isn't even available in the U.S. I saw it as one of my suggestions on Netflix streaming and figured, what do I have to lose? What I found was on of the smartest, most original stories in years. Repeaters isn't just a weird science fiction movie or a drama about addiction, it's both, and it's a whole lot more. Fusing elements of action, drama, and science fiction, Repeaters will have you on the edge of seat craving for more. Words can not express how well written this film was and how it will give you a full range of emotion in just ninety minutes. As for the cast, I'd never heard of any of them, but they were terrific, especially Richard de Klerk, who played the most deranged member of their little group. He really connected all the elements, showing a range that most actors today can't even dream of attaining. Repeaters is a tremendously written roller coaster ride of emotion, with some outstanding performances, and stunning conclusions, and for that it gets labeled as one of our can't miss movies!",1361491200,2,1431,4.6156862745098035
8460745,2,B0057I5T10,"I watched repeaters a few days ago, and it's a frustratingly uneven movie.  after the first five minutes, i thought this was going to be something really special, a sort of brick meets groundhog day kind of situation, but it quickly turned out to be a repeat of groundhog day with far less entertaining results.  first, the good:  the three leads are impressive. dustin milligan and amanda crew are damn near brilliant as the two repeaters with an evolving sense of morality, who are sincerely trying to make amends for the pain they've caused with their substance addictions.  after a few days of messing with the consequence-free parameters of a day that repeats endlessly, they find more solace in one another as well as in the mission of doing things the right way.  the fly in their ointment is richard de klerk, the other member of the rehab facility that is gifted with the opportunity to do everything over and over, and he is much more interested in getting what he wants, inflicting some suffering, and coming up for air the next day to do it all over again.  the big problem i had with this movie was that there were a few riveting conversations and dramatic moments early on, and then the movie descends into a relatively by the numbers actioneer, with tiresome chases and uninteresting sadism.  i honestly could have watched the three leads dance conversationally over cigarettes the entire film, so good were the three main actors.  in the end, they were overwhelmed by a script that needed much polishing, a story that was only partially conceived, and that ultimately degenerated into a not-so-subtle rip-off of groundhog day.  i do believe this movie is worth watching, and there were good things about it; it just set me up to want more.",1361232000,,1755,4.746710526315789
8460746,5,B0057I5T10,"Repeaters is a dark existential film that highlights themes of violence, revenge, despair, nihilism (or meaninglessness), morality (even in the absence of permanent consequences), trauma, addiction, guilt, and choice. Despite the occasional plot hole, I like this film because it is exciting and (I think) informative about the human condition. Each of the 3 characters is presented with a choice as to how they want to face the day (which is a metaphor for how they are to live their lives more broadly speaking).

Kyle, Sonia, and Mike are presented with the philosophical problem of nihilism, which can be understood in the form of a question: If all our choices, both for good and ill, are inconsequential, then what kind of life would you live? In the film, each main character's consequences are erased at the end of the day, but this rule may apply to people in real life as well, just on a longer scale. In the grand scheme and sheer vastness of the cosmos, every human action is completely insignificant and inconsequential, unless perhaps if there is an afterlife or higher power(s) that keeps a moral bookkeeping of human events. Regardless though, each character is tasked with taking a stance towards resolving this existential problem.

FURTHER ANALYSIS & SPOILER: Initially all 3 characters use the repeation to carry out childish fantasies, live a life of excitement, pleasure, and vengeance. (Their early stance reminds me of the psychological allure of playing Grand Theft Auto as a teenager). Soon enough however, Kyle and Sonia become disillusioned with this lifestyle and feel existential guilt, even though they can escape the consequences of their choices. Motivated by the pain of their guilt, they begin to make efforts to reconcile with the important figures in their life, which leads them to find a deeper meaning in their existence. By choosing to relive and confront the mistakes/demons of their pasts, Kyle and Sonia are paradoxically freed from the repeation cycle (and perhaps from their addictions as well). Their path reminds me of various spiritual and more secular-ish inner conflict resolution theories (as I understand them) such as: death & resurrection (Christian stance), breaking the cycle of spiritual suffering & achieving nirva (Buddhist stance), psychological regression & integration (depth psychodynamic clinical therapy stance).

In contrast, Mike embraces the dark side of the repetition. Being trapped and alienated in an existence without consequence, but still quietly despairing that his father and him will never reconcile, Mike displaces his guilt & sorrow in the form of rage onto other people by choosing a life of violence and sadism. Sadly, he remains trapped in the nightmarish repetition cycle, even after committing suicide at the end of the film.",1360454400,,2811,5.228381374722838
8460747,5,B0057I5T10,"Amazon CA (Canada) has this disk at a very reasonable price and even downright cheap if you buy it used.  Why it is unavailable in the US I do not know.

8460748,5,B0057I5T10,"I absolutely loved this movie, it reminds me of Groundhog Day, but much more dramatic and dark.

8460749,5,B0057I5T10,"Though this one is a big rough, raw, and gritty, the message is very clear and powerful.  Many would even say a bit preachy or overkill.  However this never bothers me and I found it very different, creative, and all-in-all, just a wonderful flick.

It's about three kids in their twenties, who are fed up with society and are disgusted at having been forced into a drug abuse rehab center in ""Mission"", British Columbia.  Strangely, they awake one day to find they are re-living the same day as before, and this happens over and over.

Two of them begin to learn, however, how important it is to make every day and moment of our lives count -- and for the better.  The third friend uses his ""gift"" of ""repeats"" (repeating days) to terrorize and harm others, and take enjoyment in it.  At one point, he even forces another of the friends to kill someone, all to find out the next day, that nothing had actually been changed.  All the while, we see that there is change -- and dramatic change -- within each of the three friends.

SPOLER ALERT!

I found it commical or interesting, how, in the last few frames of the movie, that Kyle and Sonia apparently were not forced to repeat their day again (apparently they had learned their lesson (I surmize this because it is always repeating from the point of view of Kyle, but then of Mike)) and Mike Weeks wakes up to find he is repeating the day AFTER the repeating day, the day in which he held Kyle and his family at gunpoint and shot himself.

Interesting also to note that Richard de Klerk, who plays Mike Weeks, is also a producer and owns his own company.  Such a young person to be so accomplished.

I'm also disappointed, however, to find out that this movie is out of print and so hard to get on the US Amazon.  And if you do ""get"", then you give out a lot!  There are only two copies I see on Amazon and they are for $27.22 and $52.98 respectively!  I'll check out Amazon.ca.  Just finished.  Relieved again to find it new for $12.49 CDN (basically the same thing right now as $12.49 USD), and even a used copy for $5.20 CDN.  So there, you have no excuse not to get it!  I would recommend it.  Not for younger kids, however.",1345420800,,2181,4.349009900990099
