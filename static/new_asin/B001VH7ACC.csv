prompted to ask myself:""What can I do to help this crisis which will affect us all more sooner than later?""
This video points out that our society's mantra has been to use more of everything faster as we go along. This is a recipe for
collapse and ecological disaster. Our depleating world of oil, coal and minerals is a potential for geo-political problems
as well. Access of water is an ever growing problem for the 20th century.
The final straw: climate change has already reared to cause overwhelming disasters.
The reality is that our civilization needs to change now or else we will fail to reverse this alarming tide.
We can win this challenge by diversifying our transportation system, promoting mandatory recycling and changing
agricultural practices. The film ends with an optimistic upbeat, recalling the success of our country when we were
attacked in World War II.
Now we have to think of the longer term: it is a matter of survival.
I feel that ""The Great Squeeze"" should be see by everyone. It's importance overshadows everything else for us humans
on the planet, stressing a call to action for everyone.
BRAVO TO TIROIR FILMS FOR LEADING THIS CALL!",1296432000,3,1283,4.889908256880734
8583607,5,B001VH7ACC,"This video brings to the forefront many of the 'hidden' dimensions of our civilization as it relates to the use of fossil fuels.  Our current lifestyles take so much for granted, especially the energy we have available to us, which seems in infinite supply. However, this video helps us take a step back and reexamine the source of all those things which we take for granted, and the impact on our Earth that our entitlements are having. Best of all, this video helps us look at our civilization in a totally new perspective, which is the essential first step in making wise decisions about our environment. The bottom line is this: our outlook as a species has shifted from us being a part of the natural world to the natural world being a part of us and our economy and our civilization.  This video urges us to switch back and realize that human society is part of the environment, not the other way around.",1252281600,5,910,4.5426829268292686
8583608,1,B001VH7ACC,"I hoped to find fresh new action ideas for reducing impact on the natural resources, plant and animal species and their habitats.  The most important issue was not emphasized: Planet Earth's urgent need for humans to embrace 1-2-child families in preference to larger ones worldwide.  Such a worthy behavior change would validate use of the immense U.S.public relations and promotional skills.",1250726400,3,393,5.426229508196721
