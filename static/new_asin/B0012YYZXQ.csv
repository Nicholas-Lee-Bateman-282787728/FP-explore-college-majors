3100237,5,B0012YYZXQ,This set of Planet Earth Series is so breathtaking I really don't have the words to describe it. My personal favorite is the Desert episode. I live in the Middle East and got really bored with the desert environment but watching this video made me develop a new respect and love for it. Excellent work yet again from Sir David Attenborough.,1215302400,8,340,4.590163934426229
