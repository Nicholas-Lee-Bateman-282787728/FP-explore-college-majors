3622652,4,B001H3AIDI,"Coming out forty-five years before The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Just Imagine was the first SF musical.  Released in 1930, it tried to predict what life would be like 50 years later.  Flying cars, numbers for names, eating food in concentrated pills, interplanetary travel--about the only thing they got right was that women would be wearing slitskirts in 1980.  There's plenty of low humor and a few good songs.  Check it out, it will make you smile.",1248307200,11,452,4.8311688311688314
3622653,4,B001H3AIDI,"I'll try to keep a straight face, here, but it might not be easy. This presents itself as a 1930s view of what 1980 would look like: people's names replaced by numbers, aircars in tidy skylanes over the gleaming city, and marriages arranged by application to the benevolent state. Oh: arranged when the man applies, since the woman's interest in the affair has no legal standing. Therein lies the romantic struggle, to present a more convincing case for worthiness to the licensing tribunal than the competing suitor does.

Well, the first manned trip to Mars ought to put enough weight in the resume. They aim their rocket, push the button, and they're off - along with the comedic relief, a tippling stowaway with a funny accent and a personality like Red Skelton's Clem Kadiddlehopper. The Martians? Of course there are Martians, why else go to Mars? They greet our adenturers with the warmest of welcomes, sometimes hinting at the steamy, but then ... well, see for yourself.

Since the vaudeville era hadn't yet loosed its grip on the image of what entertainment should be, there are songs, adventure, dance numbers, adventure, comedy, adventure, chaste romance, and a predictably happy ending. A collection of bold characters and silly predictions keep this moving. Modern viewers will see this 80 year old artifact as a campy anachronism - unless they look a bit past, and see which hopes, fears, and expectations movies of that era addressed.

3622654,5,B001H3AIDI,"This is one of the strangest films of the early talkie era. This is a sci-fi musical adventure about life fifty years in the future - 1980 at the time. The story revolves around John Garrick and Maureen O'Sullivan, whose characters are assigned alphanumeric names as is everyone else.

Garrick and O'Sullivan were also teamed romantically in ""A Song O' My Heart"" during the same year, another early musical by Fox. However, Fox is not the producer of this DVD. Instead it appears to be a public domain effort. There is no restoration of the video, although the sound is clear enough with some of the popping and hissing typical of early talkies.

At any rate, Garrick and O'Sullivan play lovers of the future that want to wed, but the state now intervenes when a woman accepts ""competing bids"" or proposals of marriage based on the merits of the applicants. Garrick has a competitor for O'Sullivan's hand, and the only way he can win in court is to do something outstanding. A nearby scientist needs a pilot for his spacecraft to Mars, and Garrick figures this is a way of distinguishing himself and winning the hand of his lady love.

As comic relief there is El Brendel, who has a vaudeville brand of humor. He comes along for the ride to Mars too. There are several musical interludes in the film including one ode to old fashioned girls - the girls of 1930 - showing flappers as moms in a none too flattering light. They still show prohibition being enforced in 1980 too, though with a promise of light beers and wines being legalized shortly.

I'd give the film 5/5 stars for being good but strange fun for the right audience. However, I'd give the video and audio quality of this unrestored film only 3/5 stars.",1243123200,16,1717,4.601307189542483
3622655,5,B001H3AIDI,"For the time this was made, this movie has a lot of wonderful elements. It's a scifi, comedy,adventure, musical, romance! Like Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"" our hero, named Single O, is brought back to life in the future and is amazed by what he sees, personal aircraft, pills for food and drink, push-button babies! He is befriended by 2 guys who have romantic problems. One of them decides to go in a trip to Mars to win the love of his girl, and the 3 chums blast off to the red planet on a ground breaking journey. On the planet, they discover that all the inhabitants are twins, one goo, one evil. They are captured by the evil twins and try for a daring escape. This lost movie has it all!",1241049600,2,689,4.3076923076923075
3622656,5,B001H3AIDI,"This is a very early sci-fi movie showing the fabulous future of ,gasp, 1980! It's a musical comedy also, about a guy (Single O) who is brought back to life after 50 years, not unlike the premise in -Sleeper-. Our comic hero, Single O, encounters pills used for food, and hostile Martians! Really a great classic for any fan of science fiction, comedy, or musicals!",1231286400,,365,4.630769230769231
3622657,4,B001H3AIDI,"This is a sweet forgotton film about the future ans envisioned in the 1930s, complete with flying cars for all, vistaphones, numbers for manes, and a trip to Mars. A man is brought back to life after being hit by lightening on a golf course. He finds himself in a world where pills are food  and drink. He makes some new friends whom he helps with their romances and their trip to Mars. Mars is inhabited by twins, by the way, one good, one evil. The print quality is average, but this film is a fun, wacky romantic, sci-fi, musical farce.",1223164800,,539,4.336633663366337
3622658,3,B001H3AIDI,"If you are expecting some dramatic, imaginative and real futuristic masterpiece, this is not for you.  If you are a devotee of early American camp musicals with poor songs, 'understated' acting and very simplistic comedy this is your thing.  As for the assumption of some intelligent space-fiction story line don't look too deep, if at all.. Some of the ideas of the future are interesting but VERY undeveloped it is all (intended?) to be very much taken with a very large pinch of salt (I hope!).  Enjoy as a film after a late night out, preferably with all critical senses switched off!",1355270400,,588,4.745098039215686
3622659,3,B001H3AIDI,"The principal value in seeing this film is to be able to say that you've seen it. I remember coming across a still of Maureen O'Sullivan astride a small aircraft in one of Forrest J. Ackerman's magazines in the late 50s or early 60s and really wanting to see the movie. Years later I did, to my great disappointment. Actually, watching it now, I find the future (i.e., 1980) sequences on Earth to be rather interesting -- the production team did some small but inventive things with dress and setting. However, once the characters make it to Mars the whole thing turns into such a mess that the Flash Gordon serials look like Bergman by comparison -- oh wait, some clips from Just Imagine WERE used in those serials. Anyway, if you are an sf person or just enjoy weird and obscure films, this should be on your bucket list. It's pretty awful, but there are design and production aspects that are actually quite nice.",1352678400,,916,4.557575757575758
3622660,1,B001H3AIDI,"The film is hardly a masterpiece but is an interesting look at the ""future"" - and the first use of the rocketship that was later used in ""Buck Rogers"". The problem is that this DVD is a poorly-made DVD-R that starts freezing about 2/3 of the way through the film.",1315180800,3,263,4.28
3622661,2,B001H3AIDI,"This is a great and hard to see film and I have been trying to get a good copy of it for decades. This review is not about the film, it is about the product. I had a VHS copy taken off the TV and missing the last thirty seconds, so this DVD is technically an improvement. That being said, the quality sucks big time. I don't regret the purchase and hopefully you won't either, but it is far from the presentation this film deserves. It looks like it was shot off of a dupe of a dupe of a scratchy 16 MM print. If this is the best quality available then Just Imagine is one step away from being a lost film. I'm happy enough to have this DVD, but I hope somewhere, someone has a good print that can be the basis of a remastered version someday. This will have to stand in for it until then.",1308960000,10,789,3.9685534591194966
3622662,3,B001H3AIDI,"This is a tough DVD to review.  For starters, Just Imagine is a piece of cinema history.  Made after Fritz Lang's Metropolis, this film is a very different take on life in the future, specifically the year 1980 where everyone has a number for a name and flies around in their own personal aero-car.  I've long known about this film and I've long known that its considered to be a very flawed masterpiece.

For starters, this film is a light-hearted musical comedy, made in 1930, which attempts to predict what life would be like in 50 years.  Probably inspired by Buck Rogers, the film is told from the point of view of a man awoken from 50 years sleep only to find himself in a strange futuristic world.  He befriends two men and hilarity ensues as they try to undo an arranged marriage between one man's girl-friend and her state picked fiance.  After a trip to Mars to prove his that he is worthy of his girlfriends hand in marriage, all ends well.

The humor in the film is forced and there are weird pauses in the action as if to allow the audience enough time to laugh before moving onto the next piece of business.  One of the film's stars is a very young Maureen O'Hara.  The real star of the film though is the wonderful set designs and special effects, which are really remarkable.  The futuristic city is a real wonder to behold and the whole film has a wonderful art deco feel to it.

Unfortunately, the DVD was probably struck from a VHS copy of a 16 mm print of the original film.  The image is soft and breaks up every so often from video noise.  I hope a better print of this film exists somewhere and that it eventually finds release on DVD but right now, this is the only record of this fantastically weird film.  If you are into retro-science fiction then I would highly recommend this film but the transfer lets it down.  However, I'm incredibly indebted to the company that released this as its the only version available and having it is better than not.",1289779200,8,1976,4.417127071823204
3622663,3,B001H3AIDI,"I Did Not Imagine that my DVD video would come as it did. The transfer was obviously completed by an amateur working with Nero and some other program to create the DVD jacket cover that was apparently created with a screenshot. I have seen worse quality of transfers concerning image clarity, but my biggest grip would be the poor work with the aspect ratio where you can clearly see that the top and bottom of the image is cut short, since care was not given in this area.

As far as the story goes, I think it is a great sci-fi/musical classical movie that all film noir fans will enjoy.",1275436800,6,589,4.3545454545454545
3622664,4,B001H3AIDI,"This movie is so fun and cute. It's a parody of the Buck Rogers comic strip series (and its imitator, Flash Gordon) that were new and all the rage at the time. You know the story: man from the present (1930 in this movie) gets preserved and wakes up in the distant future (1980) to find a weird, changed world. In this case, though, the man from the present isn't the hero, he's the comic sidekick, and quite possibly the most annoying thing in the movie.

It's worth it if you're interested in seeing what people in the late twenties/early thirties thought the future might be like, although this movie is more of a comedy making fun of those notions. The ideas about women and marriage are so outdated as to be more cute than offensive.

This DVD is of terrible quality, unfortunately. You can't get it anywhere else, so if you want to see the whole thing, you're stuck with this version. The very top and bottom of the picture is cut off throughout, the picture is grainy and washed out, and the sound clarity goes in and out.",1266019200,7,1029,4.410526315789474
3622665,3,B001H3AIDI,"THIS PRODUCT REVIEW IS IN REFERENCE TO THE DVD ITSELF -NOT THE FILM

I picked this DVD up at my local thrift store for $5.oo and it would hardly have been worth even that if not for the rarity of the film itself and it's historic significance. The print used is a beat-up, scratched, broken-and-patched, overscanned public domain print with the censor's marks still visible on the film (indicating where the racier scenes should be trimmed, but weren't). The sound is muddy throughout, but you can still catch enough of the dialog to follow the story.

It clearly came from a videotape source because at one point the tracking goes out of alignment and you can clearly see the video scan static we all knew and loved on VHS. The picture on the box is a screen capture from the film, so that should give you a vague idea of the picture quality.

There is a picture menu (no text) and a pair of trailers for Conquest of Space.

I would STRONGLY advise NOT shelling out $15 or anything near that for this DVD unless you're truly desperate to see this film.",1260748800,13,1053,4.46875
3622666,3,B001H3AIDI,"Just Understand, this is a DVD-R production with pretty poor quality video -- the text blocks (silent-movie type scenes) are badly cropped, etc.  It may be a fascinating film (I haven't watched the whole thing yet), but don't expect ""remastered"" quality by any stretch of the imagination.",1258416000,7,288,5.127659574468085
3622667,5,B001H3AIDI,"I have always been a sucker for a good musical and tossing in Mars and dancing girls what more could one ask for?

""Who is that fellow?""
""He's an idle.""
""He's idle with all dose girls?""

Just Imagine (1930) from Fox movies stars Maureen O'Sullivan who will later play Jane Parker in ""Tarzan Finds a Son!"" (1939). Looking closely you will find several other stores that you will have seen in other movies or will be in them. You will find your self kibitzing.

This is a great addition to anyone's musical / o.k. sci-fi collection.

8307734,3,B001H3AIDI,"This early talkie takes place in the distant future (1980) where people get around in flying cars, communicate via TVs, bring the dead back to life, and travel to Mars. People also have numbers instead of names, and the government decides who marries whom. The plot revolves around a young people who are in love but, by government regulation, are destined to marry others. This science fiction, romance, comedy, musical features the charming Maureen OSullivan in one of her first feature films. The movie also highlights many primitive futuristic inventions and too many singing and dancing segments. The movie has some cute moments, but the acting is terrible, the plot takes too many diversions, and it doesnt hold up well for todays viewers. You might want to check this out for some innovative cinematic techniques, a 1930s view of the future, and a teenaged Maureen OSullivan, but it will appeal to very few modern viewers.",1520812800,,929,5.0
8307735,3,B001H3AIDI,"Very interesting and valuable piece of cinema fantastic video.  Particularly noteworthy for sets and effects used in later movies [i.e. Frankenstein, Flash Gordon].  Unfortunately both the video and visual quality of this DVD is extremely poor.  The movie deserves remastering.  The DVD quality almost eliminates the pleasure of viewing this rare and noteworthy film artifact.",1504396800,,376,5.781818181818182
8307736,5,B001H3AIDI,"This is one of the great ""lost"" early talkies.  It has everything fans of the late 20's/early 30's will love.  Great art-deco sets, bad vaudeville humor, snappy songs, pre-code sex, and some pretty great special effects.  This is kind of like if Metropolis were a musical.  I want to make something clear though, this film has never been released on DVD (or VHS or laserdisk for that matter).  Anyone selling a copy would have had to get it from a bootleg, or like my copy, from a broadcast via the Fox Movie Channel.  If this print is taken from FMC then it will be pretty good.  If not, I've no idea where it came from.  It's possible it was released on some format in the early days of  video tape and that's where it derives.  Anyway, hopefully we'll get a nice 4K scan someday and this film will gain a stronger cult following.  It certainly deserves it.",1473033600,,859,4.407643312101911

8307738,5,B001H3AIDI,"What a trip!!!  LOL  Regardless of the quality of the video, the conception of what was going to be like in 50 years from then is WAAAAAAAAY off. In fact, I'm a former NASA Engineer and inventor, and I don't see domestic flying cars any time soon.  Many other SCI-FI movies from the B&W and silent era portray a future that might be many decades ahead from us... in 2015.  Fun movie.  Enjoy!",1437436800,2,391,4.301369863013699
8307739,5,B001H3AIDI,The first sci-fi musical. 1930 looking at 1980. John Lennon never imagined this!,1424908800,,80,5.230769230769231

8307741,3,B001H3AIDI,"As a diehard fan of pre-sputnik SF movies, I just had to see this film at least once, and I'm glad I did. It will certainly never get into my list of ""favorites"", but it does have its charm. I for one enjoyed the satirical look at 1930s America (which is actually what this movie is all about), especially the Prohibition Era gags. But let's be honest, as a science fiction film, Just Imagine stinks! Good for laughs (such as when the spaceship to Mars takes off with spectators standing just a few feet away, or when the explorers blithely walk out onto the Martian surface without a second's hesitation, not stopping to check whether the atmosphere is breathable), but there's no ""science"" in this movie whatsoever. Did enjoy the sets immensely - they reminded me of Dr. Seuss illustrations. And the acting is straight out of Vaudeville - excellent stuff, if you go for that sort of thing (I have a high tolerance for it). Sadly, the very best scene in the entire movie is right at the beginning, when the two main characters park their personal aircraft in mid-air to talk to one another, and are told to ""move along"" by a stereotypical Irish cop in a floating traffic signal (which he manually operates).

But the quality of the DVD? Truly dreadful! The edges of the film seemed cropped throughout - not only left and right, but top and bottom as well. I can deal with scratches and skips (I am, after all, a fan of really, really old cinema), but the sound quality is unforgivable. Also, it appears to have been copied off of a TV broadcast. At one point, the channel logo even briefly appears in the lower right corner.

But all in all, I do not regret my purchase, and am not asking for the time back that I spent watching it. So if you enjoy really obscure classic cinema and have a high tolerance for corn, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection.",1374105600,5,1866,4.469208211143695
8307742,5,B001H3AIDI,"Here is a film that has to be the most imaginative American film of 1930. A truly original story about space travel and the future in the then far-off year of 1980. This film has taken a lot of bashing over the years including a negative review by Leonard Maltin. This film has a truly novel story for an original sound musical and this is my favorite of the early Fox musicals. At least we don't have to listen to the icky warblings of Charles Farrell or the headache-inducing screeching of Frank Richardson, both featured in the films Sunny Side Up and Happy Days, two other exsisting musicals from the early days of Fox Film Corporation. Marjorie White, though not top billed, runs away with this. She was truly a terrific singer and film personality who would have probably had a long carrer in films if not for the tragic fact that she was killed in an auto accident a few years after Just Imagine came out. The print here, as some have pointed out, is not the best, but this is not an official release from Fox or even Alpha. Truly, if you want to see this film, this will probably be as good as it gets quality wise. No Broadway Melody-style ""the show must go on"" type of plot here. This is for the film fan who wants something different in a musical",1367884800,2,1257,4.353191489361702
8307743,1,B001H3AIDI,I paid a premium hoping to get a better digital image than the free one on Youtube copied from a Fox broadcast. The special effects are impressive and historically significant.
