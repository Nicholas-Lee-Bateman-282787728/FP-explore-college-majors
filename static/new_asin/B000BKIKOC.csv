8088004,5,B000BKIKOC,"I have this film on VHS, and would give anything to get it on DVD.  It's like stepping into a Buddhist temple and experiencing zazen, sesshin, kinhin (walking meditatiion),  and mealtimes with the monks.  The temple interior is the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  It makes me  want to join the monks, even if it means getting hit by the keisaku.  Please someone get this out on DVD so I can continue to enjoy this film after my VCR dies.",1400630400,,444,4.353658536585366
8088005,5,B000BKIKOC,"I agree with reviewer C.Nelson that this is a ""must-see"" film and that it is indeed a work of art, Zen art. I've shown excerpts to religious studies and Buddhism classes over the years

Not at all like your ordinary didactic documentary, Zen: In Search of Enlightenment has long sections (especially in the film's first half and later segments) with no verbal commentary whatsoever, just a ""being there"" or ""being with"" the ""Suchness"" or ""Thusness"" (Sanskrit: tathata) of whatever is being depicted: human scenes of Zen practitioners (in sitting or walking meditation, lying/sleeping, working), or scenes of very old temple objects or scenes of surrounding nature.

Such passages really do eloquently convey the ""just being,"" ""just sitting,"" ""just functioning"" nature of the Zen way.

My one critique of this film would be the surprising use of Toru Takemitsu's overly ""western/foreign"" sounding polytonal ""avant garde/modern"" musical soundtrack created for the film, a soundtrack that usually deploys non-Japanese instruments--violins, synthesizers, etc (performed by ""The Tokyo Concerts"").... i'd much rather have a track of classical, traditional Zen music... e.g., the soulful shakuhachi flute and koto stringed instrument. We get a little of the latter in the soundtrack, but not nearly enough.

But then, maybe the film-makers' choice to use such a novel approach with the soundtrack is itself a bit of spontaneous Zen whimsy!",1328140800,,1432,5.46606334841629
8088006,5,B000BKIKOC,"This is a beautiful, but rare film documentary on ZEN: In Search for Enlightenment. It was written and directed by Toshimaro Ama. It is about ZEN Buddism and what it's like to live in a Japanese Buddist monastery in search of Satori. It's gives one a glimps into that history and spiritual journey. If you have a desire to know more about what it is like to live, work and pray in a Japanese Zen monastery then this is a must see film. It's not just a film, but a piece of art. I wish everyone could have a chance to see it. It's too bad this film was never re-issued to dvd format.",1300924800,,582,4.114035087719298
