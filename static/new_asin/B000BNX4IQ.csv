8324986,3,B000BNX4IQ,"Its okay I like reality tv like this when its unscripted/caught on tape stuff. First its some kinda religious festival where people impale things through themselves I think its in the Thailand. Then some guy who holds a world record for passing electricity through his body. Creepy. There was a spy museum. Cool. A taxi that's also like a nightclub inside, lights and lazers. Some occult stuff. Females who crossdress as men. Some guy in Japan who's a cannibal. I think they said he's got very rich parents who paid off politicians and cops so he gets away with it. It was so creepy he's got some lady interviewing him. There's some rats the size of dogs and cats. Some French guy who eats glass, and other disgusting things. You'll get your moneys worth when you see the topless carwash. For some reason it shows some dumb footage of Ghallager the comedian. Also some guy with Disney tattoos all over his entire body. They're not even detailed or that great. Its okay if you wanna kill an hour. Warning though some of that stuff is very gross, that's why I wrote this review as a warning.",1395100800,,1089,4.561224489795919
