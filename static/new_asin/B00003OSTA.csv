I am giving this volume one star because this volume, which states that it is complete and unabridged, is violently abridged! Large sections - including entire chapters have been cut out of this book. If you want the whole story - do not buy this copy. Unfortunately, it does not appear that amazon sells any that are complete so you will have to purchase a complete book elsewhere.",1524614400,,451,4.512195121951219

1332505,5,B00003OSTA,My first reading. Loved every part of it. I read on the .99 Kindle copy. No errors. No formatting issues. Nice option when you need this heavy book on the go. No pictures. But everything else was as expected.,1523232000,,208,4.358974358974359
1332506,2,B00003OSTA,"Incredibly boring and ultimately incomprehensible, except for the sea battle and chariot race. Check out the silent version. When wealthy, privileged Ben Hur returns to Judea, he doesn't  sneak in. He gathers an army to save Jesus from  being  crucified! (But is only dissuaded by learning the true message of Jesus). This may be the most over-praised movie ever made. The silent version, though very hokey, particularly in the hand-tinted, color, biblical scenes, has the most exciting chariot race I could ever imagine. Cameras are placed in  pits which the chariots ride over, as well as in the the air. Additionally, the final part  of the movie actually makes sense!",1523059200,,671,5.0636363636363635

1332511,3,B00003OSTA,"Great movie, but this is the typical slipshod Warner bluray. The picture is not the clear, crisp image you want from a good bluray. It looks like there is a very slight static at all times. Evidently no restoration nor anamorphic transfer was added to the budget. And that's a shame, as this is one of the all time great epics, and home viewers should have the opportunity to purchase a top-notch presentation.

Instead we get another half-measure product from Warner.",1522454400,,468,4.777777777777778
1332512,3,B00003OSTA,"I was looking for something to read and ran across this novel. I'd always loved the movie so decided to give it a try.
 The first 'book' (the novel is divided into 'books') was a real struggle. If the traditional biblical and non-biblical nativity stories were literally true this is what the occurrences would have been like. It's slow paced with a lot of descriptions of places I have no interest in.
The following 'books' pick up the pace a bit. At times the story is actually exciting. Unfortunately most chapters have more long passages of unnecessary and uninteresting detailed descriptions.",1522454400,,597,4.910891089108911
1332513,5,B00003OSTA,It took me a while to finish this book but it was worth it. This work of fiction is very different from modern books in that it is reverential and respectful. Its an interesting glimpse of the state of the world in the late  19th century.,1522368000,,238,4.173913043478261

1332524,4,B00003OSTA,"I am glad I read it. I bought it after seeing the most recent movie, which was very different from the 50's movie. I slogged through it and saw that it is closer to new movie than the Heston movie was. After reading it, I watched my laser disc copy of the silent movie. That is the closest to the novel. Of all versions I like the 50's movie the most. The villains in the novel are just too awful. There is no relationship between Messala and Ben Hur. And Iras is just a cartoon. She is so easy to see through. But not by Ben Hur. The book is pretty heavy handed. The sub-title is apt. Much of the book is about Jesus. Balthasar (yes, that Balthasar) is probably the 4th biggest character in the book. And of course he is the father of the evilest villain in the book. Read The Three Musketeers or some Jules Verne. You really can skip this book.",1520899200,,846,4.133333333333334
1332525,5,B00003OSTA,"Regardless of what you think of the movie or NRA-Loving, over-emoting Heston, this is a spectacularly restored film in glorious Blu-ray.
There's no accompanying materials, simply the 2 disks. Its hard to believe you are watching a film from the 50's now in hi-defintion: every frame looks great, and the musical score mix is excellent. Totally worth the money. Highly recommended.",1520812800,,380,5.245901639344262

1332532,5,B00003OSTA,"This book is fun to read and for a history buff pretty incredible, not least because this treatment of the story of Jesus written in the 19th century was imagined in a way so revolutionary in that time. The description of the Gallileans, the nuanced capture of the personalities of the three wise men (especially the recognition of Balthasar's ""introverted"" thought process in his lovely soliliquoy about the nature of the Soul and its kingdom), the entire setup of Ben Hur's personal journey as a Jew in the time of Jesus - the whole thing is beautiful and so creative.

1332539,3,B00003OSTA,"I know Ben Hur is a classic. I know I'm supposed to like it. The problem is that I don't. I respect it, and I appreciate the patient world-building the author does. The pacing, however, is incredibly, ridiculously slow. I started the book thrice in the last ten years, but the farthest I've ever gone is 1/3 of the book. This last attempt, I just gave up, read its summary online, and jumped to the ending. I hope readers who try to read this will have more patience than I ever had!",1519948800,,483,4.260869565217392
1332540,5,B00003OSTA,"This 1959 mega-watt spectacle, in its day the most expensive film produced up to that time, the movie that saved M-G-M from  impending bankruptcy, seems like very distant thunder now in 2018. That is not because it isn't a good film, it most certainly is, though over the decades it has had its detractors. The biggest, costliest, longest epic in the then very popular Bible Epic genre, 'Ben-Hur' was the studio's risky re-make of their 1925 silent screen extravaganza, and it held its own in every department save for a far inferior Battle at Sea sequence which the older film used real galleons compared to noticeable miniatures in a water tank for the sound redo. Other than that, the Camera 65 ultra-widescreen 'Ben-Hur' overwhelmed audiences with its magnificent cinematography, sets, costumes, a bombastic but often moving music score and melodramatic yet powerful acting by a large cast of pro actors, headed by that chiseled monument of masculinity, Charlton Heston, at his most charismatic and handsome as The Prince of Hur, devoted to saving his people and demanding revenge on his boyhood friend, the equally handsome Roman Centurion, Messala, played with sneering ferocity by Stephen Boyd. This 'Tale of the Christ' had its Sunday School Aspects more than authentic ancient historical accuracy, but it was an impressive show, none more striking than the chariot race, one of the greatest thrill rides ever captured on celluloid (that's film, for those of the latest generations used to digital filming and projection). Veteran director William Wyler made sure this remake added humanity to the gargantuan settings. Highbrow critics have never held 'Ben-Hur in high regard, but it remains one of the iconic films of the late 1950's, early 60s era. Amid the highly Technicolored religiosity , what makes this movie work is its epic sweep and an exacting tale of personal injustice avenged.",1519776000,,1899,5.145631067961165

It is a story that felt I may have shared so long ago....  It is a story of hope and love and of a story that could have been true.  General Wallace wrote this
A epic story of the life of Judah Ben-Hur and and a parallel lifetime  of Jesus.  How General Lou Wallace came up with this tale after the long and terrible Civil War.  I can only wonder where did he ever get the material for the epic adventure.  The famous Chariot race still holdsl one of the longest action scenes in a movie to this day...  Eight minutes of non stop action and all without the modern special effects.  This movie  gives you a little understanding of what Judea could have been like at the same time of Jesus... Watch and enjoy this adventure with family or friends and come away understanding the process of turning a masterful book into of of the biggest blockbuster movies of all time.  This story is never outdated even if it is from 1959.  They really knew how to make movies in those days.

I admire its adherence to Scripture, the beauty of its language, its poetic descriptions of people and places, its historical details, its sympathetic portrayals of men and women as they struggle to understand the nature and import of Christ's birth and ministry, and the marvelous drama of Judah Ben-Hur's always valiant and sometimes violent struggle against the viciousness of imperial Rome, with all its twists and turns. Finally, I applaud the beautiful and unobtrusive manner in which the book poses the central question which every man or woman must answer during the course of this life, ""What think you of the Christ?""",1515628800,,657,5.149532710280374

Wallace's book, but the voices are clear and the dramatic adaptation continues to present a sound theology.  There was a description on the CD of this being *one* of the best-selling books of its day, however, and that needs to be clarified.  During the time of the U.S. Civil War, Stowe's book _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ was the best-seller for years after the war ended in 1865...until this was published in 1880.  It retained its position as THE best-selling book for over half a century until 1936 when Margaret Mitchell hit the world with her famous book.  _Ben Hur_ has been considered as the most influential Christian book of the 19th century and its story will endure for many centuries to come.",1515110400,,813,4.690140845070423

1332595,5,B00003OSTA,"Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston of Ten Commandments fame) was raised up with his best Roman buddy Messala (Stephen Boyd). Little did they know at the time that they would grow up become adversaries, and as a result this would lead to may adventures. In the process Judah leads many different lives that parallels and crosses the life of Jesus.

We see Judah in the mines, on the galleys, and even adopted by a roman Noble man as young Arrius. Mean time back at home his family is incarcerated by Messala leading to trials and tribulation that only Jesus can correct.

1332613,5,B00003OSTA,"I've had the DVD version for years, always a treat, especially the chariot race. This blu-ray is the first time, however, that I've truly seen this magnificent film as I saw it as a kid in the theaters when it it first came out. The larger the screen the better...its the widest film ever produced, coming in at 2.87:1, so even on a large HD 16:9 monitor, you're going to see rather larger black bands above and below the beautiful cinematography. Why was it produced so wide? I remember reading as a kid that director Wyler said he needed the width to get at least two four horse teams into the picture for the race. Slight downside is this version's packaging: nice, heavy multi-fold containers for the two blu-rays, with nothing of value printed on them: just giant rather blurry scenes from the chariot race. Ah, marketing. What the hell were they thinking? This film is so much more than a chariot race. The sea battle alone, with its full scale ships full of slave oarsmen, is worthy of all the Oscars this film garnered. A third blu-ray in a separate package is packed with nice documentary features on the making of the film. We're so used to the CGI in today's movies that you'll find yourself wondering just how they managed to pull off some of these scenes. The arena for the race is full scale, and those are real people in the stands. Though no person and no beast was injured during filming, the race is so real that for decades myth had it that people died filming it. SPOILER ALERT: Heston once quipped it was so real driving a four horse chariot that during filming, he stepped down from his ride and told the director he just hoped he'd win the thing, to which Wyler smiled and said ""Don't worry, Chuck, you'll win.""",1509321600,,1734,4.4905063291139244

1332672,2,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is a B movie with an A+ budget.
First of all, Charlton Heston can't act. He's wooden, and thinks he is acting when all he is doing is clenching his jaw and looking anguished. His voice barely modulates. He's not even so good looking as his mouth is way too wide for his features.
This is a LONG movie - 3 hours and 40 minutes, if I remember. The story does not justify it's length. And the story line is full of holes. Are Ben-Hur and Messala childhood friends or lovers? Stephen Boyd as Messala acts as if they had a gay thing going on. It's weird, whatever the relationship is between them.
The much talked about chariot race is merely okay. I'm sure that it thrilled audiences when the movie was released but today is seems tame.
The whole religious subplot where the death of Jesus leads to lepers being cured is just too fantastic. It's not biblical, it's hard to believer, and it is a cheap way to end a movie. A total cop out.

The language is old-fashioned and ponderous and took me a while to get used to. The description and imagery is minute in detail and while interesting, can be tedious to wade through. That said, the story was beautiful. I am always fascinated by juxtaposition of peoples lives in relation to history, especially the history surrounding the life and ministry of Jesus. The Hurs are a pious Jewish family under the heavy-handed reign of Rome and Wallace gives us a honest and factual look into the heart and expectation the Jewish people had for their Messiah- wrapped in an action-packed, romantic, philosophical novel.

This - the Charleton Heston version - hews much more faithfully to Wallace's novel. However, even at a whopping 3 hour and 32 minute run time, the original film version still had to leave out certain elements from the novel (such as Ben Hur's plotting to form an army of resistance to rebel against Rome, and the aftermath showing Ben Hur and Esther living happily as man and wife in Rome at the end of the novel).

Wallace is a better writer than in my memory and reads very well. Of course, I may have been too shallow at 13. The pictures reproduced in the Kindle are too small to add anything substantial.

Simply the best movie of all time!

The 2016 remake, should have been named differently,  simply for the sake of the posterity of the 1959 version; or at least out of respect for the pure genius of director William Wyler!

Writer Lew Wallace should have lived to see it!

1333047,3,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur, 1959 film

For nearly a century Judea was ruled by the Romans. In the seventh year of the rule of Augustus Caesar the Judeans were ordered to return to the place of their birth to be counted and taxed. Jerusalem was dominated by the fortress of Antonio. The Judeans remembered that a Redeemer would one day come to restore their freedom. Three travelers arrive and offer gifts to an infant. Twenty-six years pass. Roman soldiers pass through Nazareth on their way to Jerusalem. The Judeans resent Roman rule and Roman gods. Some are rabble-rousers. The Emperor wants more order. Prince Judah Ben-Hur comes from a rich family and is a boyhood friend of Messala, a Roman Tribune. Two more Roman Legions will soon arrive. Rome has civilized the world. They marched on Libya, defeated their army, and destroyed their capital. Messala wants to bring order to Judea (and be promoted), but Judah won't betray his people and collaborate with Rome!

A friend arrives from Antioch and greets Judah. His daughter Esther wants to marry and gets permission. Soon a Roman Governor arrives and marches through the streets. Tiles fall from a roof and injure the Roman Governor. It was an accident says Judah. Judah is taken prisoner; but he escapes and meets Messala. Messale will make an example of Judah and become feared, Messala is fearless. The prisoners are marched away. They have thirst. A man brings water to Judah. They show life on a galley ship. An ill man is replaced. Does hate keep a man alive? Those who row well can exist. The Romans will seek and destroy Macedonian galleys who attack Roman shipping. The galley slaves are forced to row faster. Number 41 is offered a job as a gladiator but refuses. The enemy is sighted, the Romans prepare for battle. Catapults throw balls of flame on enemy ships. One galley rams another midship, water rushes in. Judah frees others from their chains so they can escape. Judah saves the Roman Consul from drowning.

A ship is seen on the horizon, a Roman sail. It was a Roman victory. There is a big parade in celebration. There is a show at night. Judah is adopted by Quintus Arius, a strange destiny. Pontius Pilate was appointed Governor of Judea. Judah returns to Judea. He watches four horses pull a chariot and offers advice to the owner. The owner wants a driver to race in Rome against Messala. Judah returns to his old home, greets Esther, and learns what happened to his family. Quintus Arius the younger sends a gift to Messala - a knife. In return he asks for the freedom of his mother and sister. Alive, but lepers! They are released to return home. A man enters with his chest of coins to take bets on a chariot race. Who is his driver? He asks for four-to-one odds, and has 1,000 talents to bet.

Judah practices with his team of horses. Messala shows up with special hubs on his chariot wheels. [Was that legal?] The race begins. Messalas chariot wheels damage an opponents wheels! Messalas trick fails against Judahs chariot, his chariot is upended. Judah wins! Messala gets medical care, Judah visits him, Messala tells where his mother and sister are. Judah goes there and asks for them. When he returns to the city he learns of the trial of a rabbi. Judah watches the procession of three condemned men to the place of execution, so does the crowd. Balthasar explains the purpose of his death. A storm arises, the sky is darkened, lightning flashes. Judahs mother and sister are cured! Judah is also affected by this.

I never read the book so I cant comment on this adaption. The running length is far too long and could have been cut back without shortening the story. General Lew Wallace was Governor of the New Mexico Territory in the 1880's. He offered a pardon to William Bonney if he surrendered; this promise was not honored. You know the rest.",1487894400,,3818,4.675595238095238

1333136,5,B00003OSTA,"I loved this book as much as I loved the classic Ben-Hur film with Charlton Heston! They did differ on several points, but that just made it more interesting because I did not know what to expect. There was some violence, such as a battle and some sword fights in each of which someone was killed and sexual content including (but did not go farther than) flirting and kissing, but the story centers around Rome and the time of Christ! This was not a time of peace or goodness, there was upheaval, rebellion, lust, and violence. These instances did not make up the majority of the book, however; neither were they presented as right or desirable, but simply related what the people would have been going through at that time. It is a wonderful story of Christ's purpose on earth, presented through its impact on a young Jew, Judah Ben-Hur, who hated his Roman oppressors for what they had done to his family and nation, but found healing, peace, and a purpose in God's greater plan. There is adventure, drama, romance, and God's love in this story - I would definitely recommend this book.",1485388800,,1089,4.618556701030927

The book is obviously highly researched and gives really interesting and detailed perspective of the sociopolitical climate which existed during the time of Christ. This was interesting to me for academic as well as religious reasons.

I would give a warning of the book, which is that the language is thick and takes some getting used to. Also there were parts of the book wherein too much (for my taste) historical detail or lore of the time were described but seemed to add little to the plot and so were a little tiresome.

But over all it was a very good read.",1483315200,,692,4.390625

With movies like Gone With The Wind and The Godfather sometimes this is on down the list of great movies.  But the subject matter is as important as any movie.  Maybe it has lead some none believers to learn more about the historical aspect of this.  This seems like the role that Charlton Heston was born to play.  And it seems like him and everybody who had any part of this knew they were making something special.
There is nothing in this movie that isn't spectacular.  Best remembered for it's chariot race.  There are also sea battles.  And of course the story of Jesus.  It is almost four hours long.  And at the end you are almost exhausted.  Not from the length.  But from all the emotions that you feel.  I haven't seen the new re make of this.  But I think I can honestly say.

1333330,5,B00003OSTA,"The novel Ben-Hur has it all: action adventure, family drama, romance, betrayal. The book is at least as ""epic"" as the 1959 film. About a third of the book is focused on the famous chariot race describing the horses, the training, the challenge, and other events leading up to the race. The race itself is clearly written by someone who knew horses. One interesting detail I noted was that in the film Judah Ben-Hur does not wear a helmet in the race. I just assumed it was a typical Hollywood move so we could see the star (In how many war movies does the hero not wear a helmet?), but he does not wear a helmet in the book either! The family trials are developed much more in the novel than the film, the wise man Balthazar is an important character, and there is a love triangle. Whom will Ben-Hur fall for, the seductive Egyptian or the nice Jewish girl? It has it all.",1477785600,,873,4.329268292682927

1333336,4,B00003OSTA,"This is a great classic, and the number one selling novel in the US in the 19th century.  It is the original, without 20th century ""improvements"".  The style is very old, but the depth is worth wading through.  One thing that will put off readers who are not willing to be challenged is the dialog is in King James English (or semblance thereof).  The reason for this is that this is ""a tale of the Christ"", as the subtitle indicates; our hero, Ben Hur, is a witness of events in the Gospels near the end of the novel.  At the time the book was written, the only widely used English Bible was the King James, and it was considered inappropriate to ""reword"" the Bible.  Therefore, any dialog from events in the Bible is taken verbatim from the King James, and for consistency (?), most of the rest of the dialog in the novel is also in King James English.  Please beware of the fact that there is one edition of the ""original"" from the mid-20th century (published to go along with the 1959 movie) that updates the language and is easier reading, but the plot is different and the theology is missing.  Like steak vs. hamburger, it does require a little more chewing, but the flavor is much better.",1477526400,,1196,4.429223744292237

(2) Hur spends a great deal of time and effort romancing an Egyptian beauty (the daughter of the last remaining member of the Three Wise Men, Balthasar); he eventually weds the daughter of his crippled steward. (3.) Hur meets and becomes a devoted follower of Jesus long before His crucifixion. (4) His mother and sister are released from prison years before Hur reunites with them and Christ miraculously cures them. Having seen the film more times than Id cared to admit, I find a new appreciation for the skill of the screenwriter in telling virtually the same story, but making it indeed much more visceral and meaningful.",1476576000,,886,4.874172185430464

Wallace's writing style is intentionally stilted at times, but the story moves relentlessly from scene to scene, building up to the key dramatic climax, and from there to the underlying spiritual climax.

There is only one choice: Like Heston or not (and I certainly don't like what he became in his NRA dotage), he earned his Oscar and so did every one else in this 11 Oscar masterpiece. In short, this is as good as it gets. If you planned on watching the Burnett-Downey 2016 version of Ben-Hur, save your money and buy the 1959 DVD. The commentary option by Heston and a film critic is lots of fun.",1474243200,,489,4.212765957446808

Was very engaging how Christ was intermittently added to different parts of the story and ultimately becomes the final influence of change in Ben-Hur's life. Also provided great description of the times, feelings and sentiments of society at that time and the people involved.

I won't review the 1959 movie, as it of course is awesome and the Blu-Ray is great and I can't really add much to that. But I note with hilarity that on the extras disk, there are some interviews about the movie by some famous directors. They mention in awe all the new camera angles invented for the chariot race, and are amazed where they got inspiration for the statues on the ends of the ridge in the circus.

However, if you look at the included 1925 version, the camera angles are all there, and the same statues! The 1959 race is almost a shot-for-shot reshoot of the 1925 one.",1473724800,,672,4.376
1333594,4,B00003OSTA,"General Lew Wallace wrote this book 15 years after his service in the Civil War, so the language is a little stilted.  There are a few words that not even dictionary.com can find definitions for, but they are not used often.  I got used to the style by the time I was about a quarter of the way thru the book.  Once past these hurdles, the story is engaging and keeps things going.  The volume is divided into eight books of 10-15 chapters each.  It is in the first book that we are introduced to Jesus, and he makes a brief appearance by a well at the beginning of Ben-Hur's slavery.  The eighth book is where the subtitle, A tale of the Christ, is earned.

So much action takes place in Antioch, that I started looking for ruins on Google Earth and other mapping programs.  Not much success there, Princeton had done some excavations in the 1930's, but apparently there is not much left to be seen today, at least not from the aerial photos.",1473724800,,943,4.348571428571429

I was overwhelmed by the detail in this narrative, but had to finish this 9 hour read to see how the original ended. Good ending but the drama between Mesalla and Ben Hur was less in the original than in one of my favorite movies.

1333654,4,B00003OSTA,"I choice 4 stars because some it was so hard to read. The King James/Shakespearian style takes much brain power to fully appreciate. My brain was certainly exercised which is healthy to do. Four stars because the author took 30 words to say something that could be said in 5. I know that is the style. But it annoyed me.  The story is still epic in that it covers much more than a story; it describes cultures like no other book Ive read does. The great detail immerses the reader into the story if the reader has the patience to read it all.  The book also describes and discusses humans' relationship w God as well as w other humans and the earth. Philosophy and faith converge in many characters' soliloquies.  I liked the passion with which the author wrote this epic story. The Resurrection isn't discussed which is a shame but the fact of Christ's Deity and salvation and Christianity is all over and throughout the book.

It's a loooooong book. But much of it is worthy of reading.  If u like details details details, read it all. Our 21st century brains aren't wired for such a long book as this, written in this manner.  So patience is the word for reading this book!  Worth reading!",1472601600,,1192,4.4907407407407405

1333764,5,B00003OSTA,"This epic book does in words on the printed page what Hollywood film-makers have attempted to do on the wide screen with color and special-effects. Yes, the book is lengthy and descriptive, but it is so well-written that discriminating readers will notice neither its length nor (by today's standards) its wordiness as they become engrossed in its magnificent story. This is storytelling at its best.

In Roman times Judah Ben-Hur, a young man from an aristocratic Jewish family, is sentenced to serve as a rower in the galleys after having been falsely accused of planning to murder the Roman governor of Palestine. He escapes and eventually -- in conjunction with the now-iconic chariot race -- manages to confront the man who had falsely accused him. While all this takes place, at strategic points in his life he comes into contact with a contemporary of his, one Jesus of Nazareth. How does the life and death of Jesus Christ impact Ben-Hur and his family?

Given the obvious Christian theme of this novel, in today's diverse and often religiously-intolerant society there will likely be as many people predisposed to dislike BEN-HUR as like it. Purely on the basis of its literary merits, however, it is an outstanding work that not only deserves its classic status but deserves to be read by those willing and able to do so.",1471651200,,1331,4.884955752212389

1333786,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben Hur.  A classic tale about revenge.  A tale about finding out who really has your back,discovering who you can really trust.  Finding out that who you thought these people were may not be in reality who they are at their heart.  All along the way finding out you aren't the person you thought you were either.  Worth the read.  The beginning part of the book takes its time in character development.  Don't rush this, its important latter.  Ben Hur is meant to be enjoyed piece by piece. Slowly like a good ole chunk of cake.  Please read and enjoy.",1471219200,,553,4.45

1333827,5,B00003OSTA,"I am enjoying this paperback edition of Ben-Hur but am puzzled by 2 things. First, the cover depicts Achilles dragging Hector around the walls of Troy--although I suppose it sort of looks like a chariot race. Secondly, the name of Sir Edwin Arnold heads each facing page. Since he isn't the author (that's General Lew Wallace) nor, as far as I can determine, the editor of this wonderful book, I'm just assuming that's a printing error and some plates used to print Arnold's book were duplicated for this version by Wilder Publications. Anyone have any insights on these flaws? Aside from these oddities, I am loving this Tale of the Christ and recommend it to anyone who enjoys the florid Victorian style of writing and a wonderfully imaginative look at the birth and ministry of our Lord Jesus.",1469404800,,796,4.77536231884058

Wallace's writing style is captivating.  And since it is far different from the movie, it made me appreciate the writing skills of the movie studio.

He paints a very graphic picture but at times the story moved slowly because of it.  Necessarily the movie omitted a great deal of material in order to reduce the length.  At times the story was even changed somewhat.  All of the material about Balthazar's daughter was omitted in the movie and in the book, Messala isn't killed but only crippled in the chariot race.

It describes the life of Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew who makes his fame in Rome as a charioteer after being a galley slave, and eventually returns home to rescue his leprous mother and sister.  One of its chief features is the parallel story about the birth and death of Jesus, and there are a few interactions that Ben-Hur has with Jesus that will have a profound effect on his life.  The character of the Messiah is one of the central questions that the novel deals with, particular the question about whether Jesus will have a political kingdom or a spiritual one.

Ben Hur has been adapted for film several times, and with the 1959 movie being the most well-known and highly regarded.  It was the most expensive film of that time, and also one of the most successful.  Having read and enjoyed the book immensely, along with its thought-provoking themes, I was disappointed by the significant ways in which the film departs from the novel.  The differences are striking.  Some important characters do not even appear in the film (e.g. Iras the daughter of Balthaser), and the film attempts to streamline the Ben-Hur's world by conflating the servant girl Amrah with Simonide's daughter Esther.  Events also occur quite differently in places (e.g. the leprosy and healing of Ben Hur's mother and sister), and elements of characterization are presented with a very different focus in some instances, especially for Ben Hur and Messala.  The crucifixion of Jesus plays a larger role in the film than the book, and some of these scenes will prove quite graphic for younger viewers.

But perhaps the biggest difference is the fact that the film completely eliminates Ben Hur's concern with the nature of Jesus Christ's kingdom. In the novel, Ben-Hur is active training legions of soldiers, as part of his plan to rebel against Rome, because he is awaiting Jesus to be instrumental with this.  Instead of such theological questions, the film devotes screen time to the  epic spectacle of the chariot race, and these dramatic scenes are indeed what it is most well known for.  I'm not convinced that the film benefits from these changes.  I concede that it has proven to be a very popular cultural icon in its own right, but it has to be realized that the story it presents has quite a different feel and flavour than the original literary work.  Judged on its own merits, the 1959 film is a gripping story, but if you are coming to the film from the novel, then do expect some level of disappointment. But as an independent cinematic achievement, this film still stands up as a classic.  - GODLY GADFLY (May 2016)",1462406400,,2780,4.758333333333334

1333908,3,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur, a historical novel by former Civil War general Lew Wallace, was published in 1880. The best-selling American novel of the 19th century, it combines a Count of Monte Cristo-esque revenge tale with a retelling of New Testament accounts of the life of Jesus Christ. Those who think they are familiar with the story from seeing the award-winning film adaptation will be surprised at how much Wallace focuses on the latter subject matter at the expense of the former. The book opens with an extensive rehash of the story of Christs birth, from the meeting of the Magi through the Nativity. Wallace loads his narrative with vivid descriptive details of the clothing, architecture, food, animals, and multicultural peoples of the Middle East. All this ethnographic and archaeological detail adds to the authenticity of the story. This realism is negated, however, by Wallaces decision to pepper the book with supernatural phenomena, from choirs of angels to the miraculous healing of the sick.

Judah Ben-Hur is the son of a wealthy aristocratic Jewish family in Jerusalem, then part of the Roman Empire. A Roman boy named Messala is his closest childhood friend, but as the two reach manhood their differing races and faiths set them at odds with each other. When the Roman governor of Jerusalem is injured in an accident, Messala deliberately accuses Ben-Hur of an assassination plot. Ben-Hur is condemned to be a galley slave for life, and his mother and sister are taken away, he knows not where. While spending years in chains, he vows that someday he will have his freedom, reunite with his beloved family, and wreak his vengeance upon Messala.

Much like The Count of Monte Cristo, Ben-Hur is the beneficiary of a great deal of unbelievably good fortune and uncanny coincidence in his epic quest for retribution. Wallace attributes his heros dumb luck to the will of God. I prefer to think of it as romantic license on the part of the author, which can be forgiven for the sake of a good story. What cant be forgiven, however, is the plodding pace with which Wallace proceeds through his narrative. The lead up to the climactic chariot race takes forever, and in the end one discovers it wasn't really worth the wait after all. Ben-Hurs love interest is a beautiful Egyptian temptress whose sole purpose is to spout interminably long folk tales and creation myths. Throughout the book Ben-Hur and his supporting cast engage in debate after debate about the nature of Christ and what his title of King of the Jews really signifies. The way Wallace weaves the life of Christ into Ben-Hurs story is clever at first, but eventually the book just devolves into a nearly verbatim recitation of the Gospels, a story the reader has likely already heard.

Its possible to write a historical novel dealing with religious and theological themes in a way that appeals to an audience beyond the devout. Henryk Sienkiewicz proved that with Quo Vadis. Wallace, on the other hand, is clearly preaching to the converted. The fictional story of Ben-Hur is an admirable creation, but its opaquely obscured by the heavy-handed application of Christian dogma. Its hard to even find a moral lesson here, other than simply, Believe in Christ. Wallace could have used the story of Ben-Hur to make a powerful statement about forgiveness or redemption; instead, he just paraphrases scenes from the Bible. Thus, the more devoted you are to the Christian faith, the more likely you are to enjoy the book. Readers simply looking for an epic adventure of the ancient world would be better off turning to Sienkiewiczs Quo Vadis, Gustave Flauberts Salammb, or Gore Vidals Creation.",1461801600,,3658,4.954397394136808

I find some of the old classics rather boring. Which ones I will keep to myself, as other may disagree. We all have our own preferences.

1334052,1,B00003OSTA,"I bought the 4-disc edition thinking I'd get all the extras mentioned in the customer reviews. I thought I'd get several documentaries about the making of Ben Hur, and the silent version. Instead, I got two editions of the film, BD and DVD - two discs each, and the only extras was a commentary track and soundtrack.

The problem is Amazon doesn't separately describe each edition, and the customer reviews for all editions of Ben Hur are lumped together, including some very old editions of the film. The extras I thought I was getting evidently was for another edition of the film.

I bought the 4 disc version, and paid extra thinking I'd be getting the most extras, and I got practically nothing extra. Basically I paid $26 and could have gotten the $10 edition instead.

The blu-ray print was actually wonderful, and it's a fantastic film that deserves 5 stars. I don't see the point of selling a combined BD & DVD package.",1447200000,,928,4.646341463414634

1334060,5,B00003OSTA,"I love Ben Hur. It is one of my favorite books of all time. I got into it after I fell in love with the 1959 movie, which is my favorite film. I also enjoy audio books quite a bit. I got this one for Christmas last year and finally managed to find the time to get through the whole thing. I wanted to post a review of the audio book because it is difficult to find one that actually reviews the audio book rather than just the book, which is of course excellent. I felt it was warranted because those who enjoy audio books often wonder about the quality of those they are looking to purchase, which can vary wildly depending on how well the reader(s) invests him or herself into the characters. Thus, this is for you, fellow audio book lovers.

Voice

Lloyd James reads the book, and his voice is quite good for the reading. He does do a few different voices depending on the character. These become fairly recognizable, though he doesn't have quite the range of Jim Dale (see his phenomenal readings of the Harry Potter books). However, Ben Hur, Simonides, and other major characters are distinct in how they speak. James sounds about the right age for Ben Hur himself, which lends some credibility to the reading.

Recording Quality

The recording is generally excellent as well, with no shifting volume between tracks. (That is, there are no portions I could tell where it was louder or quieter than the rest of the book, such that I had to mess with the volume.) It is steadily recorded, with track breaks at around 3 minutes on the dot every time. It runs about 24 hours and spans 19 discs.

I do have two problems with the recording, which are minor enough for me to still give it 5 stars on here, though my overall score I would say is 4.5 because of this. First, about an average of once per disc, there is a skip in a track. It's seemingly random and it really just splits one word in half. I noticed this both on the CD and in the same place on my iPod, which suggests that the skip is in the recording. I never felt it meant I didn't understand what happened, but there was at least one of them that seemed to leave out a word. The other problem is that there are a very few (I can only remember about twice where it happened) times where James' voice sounds quite tinny, as though he was too far away from the mic. This only happened for about 2-3 seconds each time I heard it.

Miscellaneous

The discs are in three separate booklets, which are of average quality. The discs slip out if you hold the booklets upside down, so if you take them in the car you'll want to make sure to store them safely.

Score

Overall, I'd give it a 4.5/5, the only downside being the occasional skips in the reading. The book is phenomenal, of course, and the recording does it justice. James did a great job reading the book, and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it.",1446595200,,2863,4.326492537313433

1334070,5,B00003OSTA,"I first saw the movie when it was released in 1959 and often used the chariot race scene in my world history classes.  I regularly used the term ""bigger than Ben Hur"" but had never read the book.  Since I am retired and have more discretionary time, I decided to remedy this deficiency in my reading.
I was amazed at the level of detail General Wallace included in Ben Hur especially in light of the fact that he had not visited the Holy Land prior to the book's publication.  Having been to the region a number of times and considering myself to be familiar with the history of the time period, I was impressed with his accuracy.
My only criticisms deal with the somewhat lofty and ponderous language he used in the novel.  The modern reader would have difficulty wading through it.  Also, I question the ability of Ben Hur to raise three Jewish legions without the knowledge of Rome.
I recommend that someone interested in the book view the movie first.  Quite frankly, I felt that the story line of the movie was more plausible and moved along better.",1445385600,,1054,4.521052631578947

If you suffer through it, as I did (mainly listening to the audiobook during workouts), it will be obvious why the writers of the movie cut out ALL of that.  One really must be an ""anything Christian has to be good (or I have to pretend to like it)"" sort of person to think this is a great novel.  The language is stilted, even for the late 1800's.  The characters are hopelessly flat.  All the most saccharine Christian tropes about the birth and death of Jesus are made even more cloying.

1334151,5,B00003OSTA,"The 1959 movie BEN-HUR is epic in every way,and remains, to this day, the High Water Mark of not only biblical epics, but American films in general. ( it's my favorite film of all time, so I'm a little prejudiced! ) The same can be said of General Lew Wallace's tale of ancient Judea, in the category of historical fiction. Unlike the film, it starts with the initial gathering of the 3 Wise Men out in the wilderness, and we get their back stories, and ends with Ben-Hur married and with a family, some 5 years after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In between these bookends, Wallace paints us an incredibly detailed account of the times - both socially, politically and religiously and with great descriptions of clothes, food, lodgings and furnishings and so on.  We get more characters than were in the movie, along with a lot more situations and events that take place. If you have the patience, because this is a very long novel, you'll be rewarded with an excellent experience! I can't praise it any higher than that!",1439596800,,1025,4.631868131868132

1334184,4,B00003OSTA,"Having enjoyed the movie as a kid, I had visions of an adventure-filled novel focusing on one essential feature, namely a very cool chariot race. The difference between the 1959 film starring Charlton Heston and the 1880 novel by Lew Wallace is enormous. After reading the first chapters, it was with surprise that I discovered online that Ben-Hur is referred to as ""the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century"" -- definitely not what I was expecting. I then settled in and enjoyed a historical novel that paints a fascinating, insightful picture of people and events from Rome to Jerusalem during the lifetime of Jesus, as well as a book that raises on quite a profound level a number of questions of personal life journeys and faith. ""What's better -- the novel or the book?"" In this case, we're dealing with apples and oranges.",1436227200,,848,4.855172413793103
1334185,5,B00003OSTA,"A movie that is probably one of the best of its genre. You do not get much better than this as historical drama goes.

Charlton Heston plays Judah Ben Hur and just takes over the screen.. His childhood friend give him the choice of ""with us, or against us"", and Hur makes the ""against us"" choice, so when he accidentally kills the Roman governor, he is sent to sea as a galley slave.

There is a fine sea battle midway where Hur saves the Roman commander. he is eventually taken to Rome where the man he saved adopts him as his son.

He eventually goes back to Judea to confront his former friend in a chariot race that he manages to win, that kills his former friend.

There are some minor religious elements woven into the tale as coincidentally this was going on at the time of Jesus. You see Jesus from the back a few times, but he never speaks.

There is some incredible camera work, and while much of the scenery is painted, it is done extremely well.

This is one that is worth watching now and then.",1436054400,,1007,4.273684210526316

1334192,5,B00003OSTA,"GENERAL: The friendship between two men degenerating into hate because of their ideals.

POSITIVE ASPECTS: The intensity of human issues present in the film.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS : Overlong passages in the second part of the film.

AVENUES OF REFLECTION: The desire to live of Ben Hur will open the door to multiple interpretations. Everyone can go of his personal vision. But it remains clear that it is his meeting with Christ that will solidify this desire to live, because both have this as the first value. Relations between Ben Hur and Messala are so intense that they approach the extreme love-hate. As the film progresses, the love scenes decline to reach a hate climax at the scene after the victory of Ben Hur in the tent of Messala. With all its torments, Ben Hur is still looking for a meaning to life. He wants to live, but why he wants to live? Ben Hur is imbued with traditional values of the biblical Jewish culture, but his understanding of Christ's sacrifice will make him more accepting forgiveness and new values of Christianity. He will try to make a synthesis with both believing in the respect for life.

Hatred allows Ben Hur to survive and Quintus Arrius will make him remark. Some believe that two elements that will allow Ben Hur to survive occur when Christ gives him water to drink and when Quintus Arrius delivers him from his chains. In reality, the image of Christ who gives water to drink refers to reinforce the value of life in Ben Hur. And with regard to the chains, we realize that if it was not at that time, he would have been released at another time, because with his desire to live, he was closely watching every opportunity. We note that Quintus Arrius is attracted to Ben Hur. One suspects that he has sadomasochistic tendencies with convicts. The first time we see him on screen, he go down to see convicts and whip Ben Hur. We often placed hatred as negative, but we realize that intense hatred can also be a driver. We see all the evil inside him. We also remember the love between the two main characters when they meet in the districts of Messala early in the film. Ben Hur reached what Messala valued as a social position, but it was not what Ben Hur sought. In order of importance, the hatred towards Messala and the welfare of his mother and sister, his people and his wife were more important to him. Ben Hur is always thirsty. We try to make us believe that he is no longer thirsty because he heard Christ.",1435536000,,2457,4.539503386004514

Compared to other biblical films from this era (Robe, Ten Commandments), Ben Hur is well done  cast, cinematography, costumes, music, etc. But compared to the novel on which its supposedly based, this film is a travesty. Gore Vidal and Christopher Frys screenplay is horrific! Ben Hur and Messalas falling out isn't a lovers quarrel either.

1334295,4,B00003OSTA,"The sub-title (A Tale of the Christ) may be a bit of a stretch. Lew Wallace was a Civil War general which makes this a work out of the ordinary. The writing is in the style of a 19th century writer, which may seem a bit plodding at times. The story mainly centers on Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew, and his family and the trials and tribulations he endures at the hands of a Roman soldier who was his boyhood friend and has come back to Judea to help control the area for the Romans. The story includes a number of references to the life of Christ which ultimately lead Judah to a belief in Jesus as the promised Redeemer. While published in 1880, the book has remained popular, perhaps because of the movie adaptions, but still worth reading on its own merits.",1430265600,,751,4.295774647887324

It was inspiring, simple, clean, with the special effects available to the fifties, not the flash/bang/crash neurotic scene-changing mess that the few contemporary movies I've watched seem to need.

1334312,5,B00003OSTA,"I am now a Christian, but did not come to this faith as a youngster.  I SO pushed against the teachings of Christ for so many years.  After I nearly died at the age of 37, my lovely wife helped me in my discovery of Him.

I have read the Bible fully wice, but it continues to amaze me daily with its open truth, and invitation to explore.

I remember watching the 1959 Ben-Hur as a13-yr-old, and it really affected me, though I continued in my ""Christian-faith-bashing"" for many years after.

I read in Wikipedia recently and accidentally, about this book and its author.  Quite a story in itself.  So i decided to read it, and listen via Audible at the same time.

The reading is very well done, and actually would be a better way to have younger people get into this book.

The story so captured me, that I couldn't STOP.  It's exciting and full of very picturesque descriptions of the environment of those times around Jesus's life.  It puts you RIGHT THERE, and you experience what it's like from a different point-of-view.

This is a good read TODAY for the Christian and non-Christian alike.  It brought me to tears a couple times, a most unusual thing for words on a page to do.

1334329,5,B00003OSTA,"This audio production of the unabridged version for Ben Hur is excellent. About the book itself:  In the early 1960's I'd gone to the movie theatre with my siblings to see the 1958-9 movie version starring Charlton Heston.  During the movie I began to understand forgiveness, redemption and God's love. Shortly, thereafter, I became a Christian.  Fast forward (well, not so fast) - I wanted to 'read' the book, so during the Easter weekend I listened to the original book (written in the late 1880's).  Again, the story had a profound impact on my life. Delightfully, there is so much more to the storyline that a movie is able to present. Lew Wallace's writing style is exciting and flows with ease.  The historical facts are fascinating and you are drawn into the action, suspense and intrigue. The character's lives are sometimes complex as they try to navigate the cultural and religious restrictions of their lives while suviving under the harsh control of the Roman empire at the time. There are other presentations of this book using different narrators - I recommend you 'sample listen' to each version first and find one best suited for you - as with all audio books.",1428624000,,1176,4.830845771144278

1334472,4,B00003OSTA,"This book was an excellent read. The only negative is that it was written in the nineteenth century and some of the language seems dated to the modern reader. It is a great story that gives a view into Middle East at the time of the appearance of the Christ. Lew Wallace, a former Union general who fought at Shiloh, became a territorial governor after the war. I don't believe he ever visited the Middle East, but researched it and the Roman Empire. From this, he generated the story of Ben Hur, providing a more complete human narrative of what it was like living eastern Roman Empire at the beginning of the Christian era.",1426464000,,625,4.491228070175438

The reason I bought and read the book was because of the title:  A Tale of the Christ.  About half way through the book, I did a Google Search on it and found that it was one of the most popular Christian pieces of literature of all time.  I had no idea!  I am only 82% of the way through the book, but will rank up there in the top 5 books of all time for me.  I especially appreciate Ben Hur's struggle between his human desire for an earthly king, and his soul's need for a heavenly savior -- and the influences in his life to lead him to the truth.

The soundtrack composed by Mikls Rzsa is beautiful, epic and if you love marching band music, this could be your new love because the brass is strong and regal in the Roman scenes.

The chariot race stands strong even today. I was shocked by how it looked like some of the racers were really violently hurt. Are they really stunt doubles or dummies? It looks so realistic and was fast paced for 1959.

It was nominated for and won, an unprecedented 11 Academy Awards including 'Best Picture' for 1959. And, Actor Charlton Heston in the title role of: BEN HUR, won the Oscar for 'Best Actor'. Included in this 4-Disc Collector's Edition is a keepsake booklet, entitled: 'The Story of the Making of BEN HUR' from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), and an optional commentary by Film Historian T. Gene Hatcher with Charlton Heston. Directed by Academy Award winning Director William Wyler, the infamous story of BEN HUR (A Tale of the Christ), is based on the Book with the same title, written by: Author and General Lew Wallace - a Civil War, hero. Written in 1880, the book versions, stage productions, silent and black and white talking with color films, were all 'mega hits' and continue to hold steady if not, gain in popularity with each new generation. Disc's 1 & 2 show the full length feature film, all 222-color minutes of it, whereas Disc-3 shows the 1925 black and white with color, 143-minute version. And Disc-4 depicts the 2005 documentary - 'BEN HUR: The Epic that Changed Cinema', which is very interesting. As well as, the 1994 documentary - 'BEN HUR: The Making of an Epic'. More 'Special Features', include: Initial screen tests, theatrical trailer's, Oscar highlights from 1960, a vintage news reel gallery and a 'BEN HUR: Journey through Pictures'. This superb, Hollywood film epic, is a timeless classic of love, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, forgiveness, healing and restoration. And how, the Lord Jesus Christ played an integral part. Also included, is the uncut and very dramatic, chariot race between Judah BEN HUR and his one-time, Roman friend, now arch-enemy, Messala. The Roman Tribune in command of the Roman Garrison stationed in Judea, where he and Judah BEN HUR were friends, as boy's. From the galley's of Roman War Ship's to the palatial splendor of Rome itself, back to Judea to the Roman Governor's Palace, and finally...home, for Judah BEN HUR. This classic, history making film portrays a fantastic story for both the Christian and secular audience alike, complete with action, adventure, intrigue, courage, faith and even, the miraculous. It is a colossal cinematic wonder, that will entertain and inspire with every viewing, and will remain a treasured film epic, for all time. Thrilling, compelling and inspirational.

1334813,5,B00003OSTA,"This is one of the best historical movies that I have ever seen, as it is based primarily on the book by Lew Wallace "" A Tale of The Christ"" that was published in 1880 in which he created a story in the historical context of the New Testament. In this movie we see redemption from the leprosy of sin as the final seen shows the mother and sister are cured of their leprosy at the same time of Christ's death on the cross. It is a great story about the fight between good and evil, honesty and treachery, friendship and enmity, gallantry and vengeance, and historically between the romans who treated their subjects as slaves throughout the vast roman empire and particularly the Jews, because the Jews couldn't accept being subjugated by the pagan romans when they are God's Chosen people, so this resulted in a tremendous conflict between the two as being presented in the uneasy friendship at first between Ben Hur and his supposed roman friend that degenerated into an open outright enmity when the roman prince revealed his true colors as a hater of the Jews in general and Ben Hur and his family in particular. This enmity culminated in the chariots race near the end of the movie which resulted in a resounding victory for the good that was represented by Ben Hur. Yet the greatest part of the movie comes at the end when Ben Hur meets The Lord Jesus Christ carrying the cross and here comes the subtle message of the novel that the movie presented brilliantly as he showed that the real victory is the victory of Christ on the cross,as the historical reality of THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST AND HIS GLORIOUS RESURRECTION is the ultimate victory over sin and death rather than a temporary victory over a material evil as represented by Ben Hur's victory in the chariot's race. By all means this movie remains one of the Greatest Classics of the movie industry and its eternal message will endure forever.",1417305600,,1907,4.6117647058823525

1334815,4,B00003OSTA,"This is a mythic film and yet most of the time considered as a peplum film whereas it is one more film about Christ, about the relations of Jews and Romans in Judea in the first third of the first century of our CE.

The originality is to center the story on two men, a Jew and a Roman who grew up as mates in their childhood but are torn apart by adult age. Ben Hur is a rich Jew and he represents the desire for peace but without any betrayal of his people, community, religion, culture, God. Messala is the top officer of the Roman legions who gets his dream realized, to be the governor of Judea. When Messala comes to Jerusalem to take his post he at once gets in contact with Ben Hur but since he wants Ben Hur to give the names of the rebellious Jews, hence to be an informer, Ben Hur refuses and they become enemies. Due to some accidental event interpreted as an attack on the governor, Messala has Ben Hur sent to the gallows where you only survive one or two years. He has the mother and sister arrested and put in prison in some deep underground cell where they will in four years turn lepers.

For reasons beyond real understanding during a battle the top officer (and consul) of the Roman fleet has Ben Hur on his flagship. When a battle starts all the slaves are chained to their oars. The consul orders Ben Hur not to be chained. The flagship is rammed but Ben Hur is able to overpower the Roman who has the keys to the chains, to unchain the slaves, which will not be of much benefit to them, and then to save the life of the consul twice, in battle and in the wreckage of his flagship. When they are found alive on some floating wooden piece of ship they learn the battle had been a complete victory. It is as victors they come back to Rome. Ben Hur is emancipated, adopted by the Consul and he becomes a horse-race champion for his adoptive father in Romes circus. But he decides to go back to Judea before the announced Pontius Pilate arrives there. He wants a vengeance.

Thats when his desire to get avenged is confronted to the horrible situation of his mother and sister who he has difficulty finding because Esther, his freed slave, who met them when they were freed from the dungeons where they had been imprisoned, swears to them not to tell. In the meantime the Arabs Ben Hur had had contact with when coming back to Judea try to use him to get even, peacefully, with Messala. One of them has a team of horses and Ben Hur accepts to drive in the circus them against Messala who is a vicious driver. But of course Ben Hur will win and Messala will die after a very serious accident during the race. Thats how and from him Ben Hur learns about the fate of his mother and sister, on dying Messalas deathbed. He finds them and retrieves them out of the valley where all lepers are kept. With the help of Esther he brings them out back to Jerusalem and thats when Jesus passion crosses Ben Hurs story. He and Esther arrives in Jerusalem on the very hour when Jesus is walked carrying his cross to Golgotha.

He recognizes Jesus as the man who had given him water when he was taken to the gallows, water without which he would have died before reaching the gallows. He tries to do the same on this way of the cross but he is pushed back by the Roman soldiers. Then we experience the crucifixion from afar since Ben Hur and Esther are taking care of Ben Hurs mother and sister: they take them to their old home. They then live the eclipse and the storm on their way home and the rain produces the miracles we all expected: the mother and the sister are healed.

This old film made in 1959 is a typical un-historical saga about Jesus and the Jews in Judea. The film over-charges the Romans. The Jews are shown absolutely pure and clean, and their violence is nothing but patriotism and it is never shown. We see them having perfect relations with the Arabs, the Semitic people around them who are not Jews and are at best their servants and most of the time their slaves, like Esther. Actually the limit between Jews and Arabs, servants and slaves is not always very clear. The objective is to show the Romans as tyrants, violent dictators, and even their saluting gesture looks like Hitlers. The Romans are depicted as fascists in all possible ways. The Jews are their victims, enslaved on their land or deported to die working because ARBEIT MACHT FREI as the famous motto said.

The film is well acted, the scenery is often beautiful and impressive, the mass of people in Jerusalem or Rome is enormous, the reconstructions of Rome and Jerusalem are brilliant and finally the circuses are outstanding. But the systematic nazification of the Romans and total vindication of the Jews living in perfect harmony with the Arabs, even when these Arabs are their slaves is un-historical if not anti-historical. The good critics are going to tell me that this is only a film for entertainment. But Hollywood knows better. The entertainment the film is bringing is nothing but a means to develop and impose a clear ideological if not political message. The fact that the Roman legions are always dressed in red is maybe historically true but it is also in perfect unison with the standard campaigns against the Reds in the 1950s, at the heart and core of the Cold War.

1334864,2,B00003OSTA,"I wanted to like this book, as I recall enjoying the Charlton Heston movie.  I don't mind the prolix rambling and lengthy asides, and I forgive the characters changing their behavior to further the author's narrative.  However, the story is just a veneer to present the author's religious and moral viewpoints through dialog and exposition, and that religion and morals are not attractive.

The author is obviously Christian, as we are well-warned in the title.  He starts by demeaning other religions as having lost the true purpose and just being a bunch of codified and prescriptive rites and actions, then dutifully recites the codified Christian rites and actions as being wonderful.  His original arguments, if convincing that Hindoo, Greek, and Roman religions are flawed, is equally compelling against Judaism and Christianity, making most of the book seem like a satire rather than a rebuttal.

Wallace presents copious historical details that mostly seem plausible, from details on how travellers are treated, to chariots are raced.  He then expects the reader to swallow the supernatural fantasies of transmutation and faith cures with scarcely any detail.  These come off as ludicrous hear-say, rather than something that might have actually been witnessed by Judah.

One of the points that irked me is that the author was very dismissive to anyone of a 'lesser caste' than the ruling elite.  He often refers to his group of characters as if the guides, servants, slaves, and lackeys had suddenly vanished.  For instance, there are at least five people together in an oasis, and he refers to ""the three of them"".  These servants are less important to him than the furniture on a camel.  Wallace may claim that Christ is available for everyone, but he certainly was only writing for the rich and famous.

There are lots of other minor points that I found disturbing.  Ben-Hur's mother is never given a name.  The love triangle seemed horrible forced and artificial.  Iras swears that she will destroy Ben-Hur, but then, for no reason given, decides not to.  Ben-Hur is supposed to be joining a military expedition in Antioch, but then goes off and does other things without any repercussion or comment.

Overall, I couldn't recommend this to anyone, whether religious or not.  Apparently most readers are so enamored with their own religion already, they do not see the hypocrisy in the book's beginning, or the glossing of detail at the end.  It could have been so much better.",1414886400,,2489,5.036674816625917
1334865,5,B00003OSTA,"If you've seen the movie with Charlton Heston, you still don't know the story.  This is not an in-you-face, melodramatic religious epic. If this story were a painting or sculpture, it would be on display in the Louvre. Mr. Wallace takes time to unfold his story in simple yet eloquent language and turn of a phrase which bear the mark of the time in which he was writing.  By the last page, I felt as though I had lived their story in real time. He evokes empathy in the reader for the characters he has created. Judah Ben-Hur and the seekers from the East cross paths several times with the carpenter from Nazareth but only briefly each time for the purpose of allowing the reader to observe the characters' reactions and thoughts on the encounters. Wallace has convincingly interwoven his story with the biblical settings. Give yourself the gift of  reading this book.",1414800000,,870,4.673202614379085

1334964,5,B00003OSTA,"What can one say about this motion picture.  A stunning achievement in film making and unequaled to anything produced since its release.  It stands alone in its greatness.  I remember when the motion picture Gladiator was released and all the talk about the digital work they did with it.  LOL....what you see in Ben Hur is what you get.  Lets see where the Gladiator films are in another 50 years.
I had the good fortune to work in Des Moines Iowa at the Capri Theatre on University Avenue.  Ben Hur played that house for 6 months in 70MM Projection and 6 track surround sound.  At the time the Capri was one of the finest 70MM houses in the United States.  Blue Ray gives Ben Hur justice and the image is magnificent.  However, nothing can compare to a 70MM image projected on a 80 foot curved screen.
Unfortunately the film makers like MGM Studios/William Wyler/Charlton Heston's are gone but we have these great films of the past.  Film makers today lack the passion and artistic ability to create a film of this magnitude.  This is a film that should not be missed by young people today as it demonstrates what excellent film making and excellent film people did to create CLASSIC film making.",1411516800,,1198,4.60377358490566

1335045,5,B00003OSTA,"The Diamond Luxe (WB) or Magno (Sony) is a completely new type of collectible disc package. Pictures and video cant do it justice. The trade name is actually NEO. I invented NEO along with PixelChrome the hyper glossy/ reflective specialty graphic substrate that it is constructed from, about 18 months ago here in my Los Angeles design studio not far from Sony Pictures. SPE is releasing the first example of NEO with Amazing Spiderman 2 at Best Buy on 8/19. The finished composite material is .100 thick and is made up of approximately 15 layers of stuff. It took about a year to refine the product to within NASA tolerances and build the equipment that makes the revolutionary manufacturing process possible. One of the key challenges was to create a precision snap fit for the disc without using a hub. The case is kept securely closed with dual neodymium magnets embedded in the material. NEO is being manufactured by DISC, the specialty packaging company that I work for, in Long Island, NY. More images and a decent 3D animation of NEO can be found here:[...] My goal was to create a completely new solution, capable of displaying celebrated imagery in the richest way possible, to create a case that is cinematic, timeless, and obscures the artwork as little as possible (both inside and out). No hubs, no trays, no borders, no cloudy plastic to look through. I also wanted it to be made from anything other than cheap molded plastic or recycled tin cans. Great movies deserve better! Not to slight Steelbooks etc, it is a great product and is still a good fit for some titles, but it is well past a decade old. I have also observed over and over that printing on recycled scrap metal drives people in this business crazy with its limitations and poor color consistency. I once heard an art director at one of the studios say that tin printing should be reserved for lunchboxes and vintage toys! I don't think that's true but I understand her frustration. Anyway I hope that collectors enjoy having something new to experience. In the wide world of commercial graphic art, I cant think of a better place to be making a contribution. - Shane Rossiter",1407801600,,2157,4.708994708994709

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: BEN-HUR is A Tale of the Christ is one of the most beloved literary classics of all time, and although it's seen numerous film iterations before, especially in 1907 and 1925, both of which were silent films, and it was William Wyler's retelling in 1959 that really made 'BEN-HUR' a household name, and there's a host of reasons for that. The first of which being a story that's epic in both concept and scope for Judah Ben-Hur, a wealthy prince in Jerusalem, seemingly has it all. His people are kind to him, and in turn, he's kind to his people. Not in a 'worship me or it's a thousand lashes' kind of way, but he genuinely treats the people who serve him as equals, friends even. However, things change when Judah Ben-Hur is visited by Messala, an old friend that now serves the Roman Empire as a military tribune. The two get along swimmingly just as if old times were upon them, but it isn't long before Messala lays out a terrifying ultimatum: Judah Ben-Hur must tell his people to roll over and be conquered, and if he doesn't, then Rome will take it by force. Judah insists he will do no such thing, and the two part ways. As promised, Rome's military marches into Judea with the understanding that their presence isn't welcome. Watching from a roof top is the Judah Ben-Hur family, where suddenly a roof tile slips and strikes the governor appointed by Rome. Although Messala knows Judah Ben-Hur is against violence and would never stoop low enough for such a stunt, he sees the situation as an opportunity. By turning on an old friend and his family, he could make the people of Judea fear him, so he promptly condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons his mother and sister. Judah Ben-Hur vows to one day return and have his vengeance.

Personally, I went a really long time in my life without paying any attention to the likes of The Ten Commandments or BEN-HUR, as I thought them to be religious films and honestly, I'm not exactly the religious type. That being said, when I did decide to put my bias aside and give them a try, I fell in love. There's so much to appreciate in BEN-HUR. Because of the massive set designs, insane amount of extras and wardrobe, and the finest details paid to the practical effects in the film, BEN-HUR is impressively immersive for a film that's 50 years old. Despite a running time that one would expect to make a film feel like it's dragging on forever, BEN-HUR is engaging from beginning to end for all of the reasons I've praised above. Even when the film isn't being 'busy' with a confrontation or action or anything else 'exciting', the character development is done well enough to ensure things move along at a very nice pace. More importantly, BEN-HUR also seems to have quite a bit of replay value to it. I've seen it before, and now I've seen it again, for what seems like the first time thanks to the restoration on this stunning Blu-ray disc, but we'll get to that in a minute... yet I already feel like I want to schedule a little time to give it yet another screening. I don't care if you're 20 and have some kind of disposition that makes you think a film from the 1950's can't be good, or if you're 60 and have seen this film 15 times, then BEN-HUR is a timeless classic and one that I personally believe can be enjoyed by most everyone. If you've been hesitant because of its age, don't be. When people praise films as being timeless, this is the kind of film they're talking about. If you've been hesitant because of a possible religious element at play, don't worry. The religious aspects aren't so in your face they're preachy. Trust me, put these typical and yet understandable, concerns aside and see what you've been missing.

Blu-ray Video Quality  For many of you, I'm sure this is the part of the review you're most curious about. Although the previous inferior NTSC DVD release looked okay, but has this 6K restoration and sourced from an 8K restoration. really served this film's justice, being superior in high-definition in every perceivable way. Oh boy it is totally awesome. The BEN-HUR' 1080p encoded transfer and the awesome 2.76:1 aspect ratio is the most astonishing catalogue title I've ever seen. As I have said at the beginning of the review. Anybody out there that still clings such ignorant claims as 'old things can't look any better in HD and should watch this Blu-ray and educate themselves in what film looks like, no matter the era it came from. Yes, make no mistake about it folks; BEN-HUR is the best looking release of 2011. Film enthusiasts everywhere have needed to rejoice. There are so many titles, and Warner Bros. is typically an offender here, that are a given a swift kick in the pants just so they can be pushed onto retail shelves, but BEN-HUR is exactly what film enthusiasts crave. The image has been faithfully preserved to retain natural grain structure, while also faithfully reproducing every last detail and colour to perfection. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this film looks better than it did during its theatrical debut. Not only does everything look immaculate up close and personal, but details in the distance look just as good as if you were looking out a window. I don't think I've ever written so much for a video portion of a review, but BEN-HUR deserves every word. Simply put it, this release is a no brainer in terms of upgrading from your old horrible inferior NTSC DVD, as BEN-HUR debut in high-definition is reference quality that every catalogue title should strive to achieve.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Unsurprisingly, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track also achieves perfection. The previous inferior DVD's, although sounding quite good, didn't exactly sound natural. Sound effects were a little loud for the track, probably just for the sake of being so. The same can be said for the score, which to my ears sounded like it was a little harsh at its peak moments. This has been rectified for this Blu-ray release, as the sound effects sound natural and 'fit' better in the overall sound design, and the score now sounds majestic instead of just noisy. Dialogue is always clean and crisp, and never sounds tinny. A good chunk of the track overall comes through the front speakers, and the most sound envelopment you get for the most part is hearing dialogue fade from left to right. There are some sound effects that come from the rears for ambience though, which completely took me by surprise for a film that's 50+ years, and they actually don't sound 'tacked on'. They too, sound natural. The entire sound stage actually gets rather rowdy during the sea battle and chariot scenes though, and you'll be impressed just by how immersive those scenes can be. Honestly, any and all of the faults that can be found in the sound design is just that, a fault of the sound design, most likely of the time. However, this is the most faithful representation of BEN-HUR I've ever experienced, and is likely to be the best we'll ever hear. More top notch marks for a stunning release!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Disc One and Two:

Newly re-mastered and restored from original 65mm film elements.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Film Historian T. Gene Hatcher with scene specific comments from Charlton Heston: Commentary by T. Gene Hatcher with Charlton Heston is a little different than most commentary tracks we've accustomed to listening to, as T. Gene Hatcher and Charlton Heston were recorded separately. Charlton Heston provides commentary for nearly a third of the film in bits and pieces, whereas film historian T. Gene Hatcher fills in the rest of the time frame. Although you'd expect the commentary to be dry since the two people involved weren't in the same room to bounce off of one another, this couldn't be further from the truth. Heston remembers many details about his time filming Ben-Hur and is able to provide discussion that has a wealth of information and just as much as heart. Hatcher is very knowledgeable about the film and provides a very factual, yet thoughtful account in regards to the history of BEN-HUR and its production. It's a long movie, and a lengthy track, as is continued on Disc 2, but if you've seen this film numerous times, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not listening to what these guys have to say, especially Charlton Heston. This really feels more like history than a commentary!

Special Feature: Music-only track showcasing Mikls Rzsa's score: The music-only track shines a beacon on Mikls Rzsa's glorious score, which could easily stand alone as a major symphonic work. The gifted composer brilliantly evokes the Biblical period with a majestic main theme, but his subtle underscoring of incidental moments lends the movie great warmth and fervour. Rarely does film music merit an isolated track, but Mikls Rzsa's exceptional, OSCAR winning score deserves to be not only heard, but honoured, and thankfully Warner has done just that with this track.

Theatrical Trailers: 1959 Loew's Theater Teaser; 1959 Theatrical Trailer; 1961 General Release Trailer; 1961 General Release Trailer and the 1969 70mm Re-issue Trailer.

Disc Three:

NEW! Special Feature: Charlton Heston & BEN-HUR: A Personal Journey [2012] [1080p] [78:00] This is an all new, feature length documentary in 1080p, that chronicles Charlton Heston's life while filming the cinema changing BEN-HUR. In 1958, Charlton Heston travelled with his family to Rome by steamship on a risky gamble in the making of an epic film which would become known as one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of all time, BEN-HUR. It would eventually go on to win eleven Academy Awards and including Best Actor for Charlton Heston, but no one knew that at the time. BEN-HUR, directed by William Wyler, would either make or break not only the studio, M-G-M but also determine the fame, fortune and career of actor Charlton Heston. Charlton Heston and BEN HUR incorporates never-before-seen 16mm footage and photographs taken on the set of BEN-HUR by Charltons wife, photographer Lydia C. Heston, as well as interviews with Hestons contemporaries, including Tom Selleck, director Mike Newell, producer Peter Snell and filmmaker (and son) Fraser C. Heston, his daughter Holly Rochell and his wife, Lydia Clarke Heston. The film shows the inside story of the making of BEN-HUR from Hestons perspective and how it formed him as an artist and actor in the years to follow. Directed by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Laurent Bouzereau and executive produced by Fraser C. Heston for the 50th Anniversary release and restoration of BEN-HUR. It is a Warner Brothers Home Entertainment production, in association with Agamemnon Films and Blue Collar Productions.

Special Feature: BEN-HUR 1925 silent version, from the Thames Television restoration with stereophonic orchestral score by composer Carl Davis [143:00] Finally, out of the 'behind the scenes' sub-menu, we come to the silent film that preceded William Wyler's epic by 34 years. At nearly two and a half hours in length, the silent picture is interesting to see, although I admit it's not a style that I can really sit through entirely. What I did see was fairly impressive though - There were many more extras than I would have anticipated for a film this age, making the amount of costumes to be seen rather astonishing, and the picture quality is quite good considering. But, the rest is fairly typical for silent films of the era. Most of the physical acting and emoting are absolutely dreadful. Over-acted and almost comical to see, this really does destroy the epic-ness that this story deserved. I guess in 1925 though, you didn't have much choice! Still though, again, this is a great piece for such a historical collection contained within a box.

Special Feature Documentary: BEN-HUR: The Epic That Changed Cinema [2005] [58:00] Current filmmakers such as Ridley Scott reflect on the importance and influence of the film on modern epics. This documentary appeared on the 2005 DVD release, and no expense seemed to be spared in order to deliver the goods. Contained within are interviews with William Wyler (archive footage) and Charlton Heston (2001 Interview archive footage), as well as some modern day filmmakers Ridley Scott and George Lucas and fans of the film alike. Whereas the previous documentary really goes as 'behind the scenes' as you can get, this one reflects mostly on the impact BEN-HUR had on cinema as a whole. Other contributors to the special documentary are Bruce Crawford, Ben Burtt, Arnon Milchan, Fraser Clarke Heston, Robert Dalva, Ernest R. Dickerson, Arthur Max, Don Davis, Irvin Kershner, Anthony Pratt, Janusz Kaminski, Sharen Davis, Elia Cmiral, Joel Cox, Caleb Deschanel and Michael Douglas.

Special Feature Documentary: BEN-HUR: The Making of an Epic, hosted and narrated by Christopher Plummer [1994] [58:00] Pretty much anything that wasn't mentioned in the detailed commentary or documentaries listed above is included here. This supplement details the path the story took from novelisation in 1880, to stage productions, to silent films in 1907 and 1925, to the 1959 epic featuring Charlton Heston. Interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with members of the cast and crew that were on the scene are all included here. Consider this an 'overall' look at Ben-Hur' and its history through expressions and art. Appearing in the special documentary are Rudy Behlmer, Gore Vidal, J.J. Cohn, William Wyler (archive footage), Catherine Wyler, Ralph E. Winters, Edward Carfagno Jr., Richard Edlund (Special Effects Director), David Raksin (Composer), Joe Canutt (Stunt Man), Yakima Canutt (2nd Unit Director archive footage), Cesare Danova (archive footage uncredited), Haya Harareet (archive footage uncredited), Marc Klaw (archive footage uncredited), Benito Mussolini (archive footage uncredited), Irving Thalberg (archive footage uncredited) and Edward D. White (archive footage uncredited).

Special Feature BEN-HUR: A Journey Through Pictures [1959] Audio-visual recreation of the film via stills, storyboards, sketches, music and dialogue: This is pretty much just a still gallery in motion, but it's worth taking a look at all the promo material that's here. This Blu-ray boxed set is seemingly very much geared towards those with an interest in cinematic history, so this shouldn't disappoint.

Special Feature: Screen Tests [1959] [30:00] Leslie Nielsen and Cesare Danova / Leslie Nielsen and Yale Wexter (without sound) / George Baker and William Russell, Haya Harareet Hair and Makeup Test (without sound).

Special Feature: Vintage Newsreels Gallery: Costliest Film Makes Screen History / The Night BEN-HUR Comes to Broadway / West Coast Welcomes Ben-Hur / VIP Opening: Capital Welcome for Ben-Hur / Japan's Emperor Goes to the Movies / Oscar Likes Ben-Hur.

Special Feature: Highlights from the 4/4/1960 Academy Awards Ceremony [10:00] This is a lengthier look at the 1960 Academy Awards includes acceptance speeches from most of the 'BEN-HUR' winners. We see Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis, Haya Harareet, Charlton Heston, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, and Eddie Fisher arriving at the gala, and such notable presenters as Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, Olivia de Havilland, Gene Kelly, and John Wayne. Wyler accepts both his own Best Director award and Hugh Griffith's supporting Oscar, and Sam Zimbalist's widow takes home the Best Picture honour for her recently deceased husband.

Theatrical Trailer Gallery [14:00] A trailer gallery showcases a teaser and four theatrical previews, all of which trumpet the movie's drama, spectacle, and inspirational nature.

Finally, 'BEN-HUR' is the quintessential epic, and this spectacular 50th Anniversary Edition from Warner Home Video may just be the quintessential Blu-ray collector's set. Boasting arguably the finest 1080p transfer of any classic film, exceptional audio, supplements galore and classy packaging, this is without question one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year and a must-own for every film aficionado. So clear some shelf space and give this thrilling Academy Award winning film a prominent spot in your library, and enjoy the passion, spectacle, and, above all, the eye-popping, fully restored image of one of Hollywood's grandest and greatest achievements. So all in all I am so proud to have this in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

1335106,4,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur (1959) can only be described as 'massive,' from the many sets, costumes, actors, dialogue, and length. This movie was a major breakthrough in terms of shooting action sequences, with untried angles, as well as using various machinery to capture their 'real' feel. The chariot race sequence is one such example. Ben-Hur is a very good movie; however, its length may be its only weakness. Despite bring enjoyable, it has a tendency to drag at times. A more condensed post-production edit would've been preferable. If epic-length was the goal, then I have no qualms about that.

This is a great DVD. Even though it isn't Blu-Ray, the picture and sound quality are excellent and do the movie justice. The film is over 3 hours long so you'll have to switch from Disc 1 to Disc 2 at some point, but that isn't really a big deal for me.

The extras are a commentary with film historian T. Gene Hatcher and Charlton Heston, and a ""music only track"" which is basically playing the movie with only the music being audible, not the voices or sounds.

Now, on to the movie. The acting, music, set design - everything about this film is wonderful. Charlton Heston is great as Judah  Ben-Hur. One of the most thrilling scenes in this movie, or even movie history, is the chariot race which was actually staged. The scenes with Jesus are very powerful. Ben-Hur definitely still holds up today as one of the greatest movies ever made. It's one of the 3 films in history to win 11 Oscars.",1405036800,,949,4.411428571428571

1335159,4,B00003OSTA,"Ben Hur is one of Hollywood's biggest Historical/Biblical epics and is arguably one of the best films ever made. It was the winner of 11 Academy Awards including best picture, actor, director. A feat that would not be repeated until 1997 with Titanic and 2003 by The Lord of The Rings: Return of the King. It follows the life of a Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who seems to have the world by the horns and everything going for him until one of his oldest childhood friends Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judea as the new Roman Tribune. Messala has been ordered to help squash the jewish resistance and asks Judah for his help in convincing the Jews to not resist Roman rule and to spying for him. Judah is outraged and flatly refuses to betray his people even for the friend he loves like a brother. Messala is extremely angry and when an accident occurs that puts Judah and his family in jeopardy Messala refuses to help Judah and in fact betrays both him and his mother and sister condemning them to imprisonment even though he knows they are innocent. Judah vows that he will return and see justice and vengence for this wrong done to his family. Through a series of events after 4 long years rowing in the Roman Galleys Judah wins his freedom and his heart burns for retribution against Messala. Among the great parts of this movie is an extraordinary performance by Heston, the epic and legendary Chariot race, and enterwoven throughout the story Judah encounters Christ several times. Judah's life and those around him are forever changed by the encounters with Christ.

I have seen this film several times over the years and each time that I have seen it the more profound it's message rang with me. Ben Hur is truly one of the classics and for good reason it has it all action, adventure, betrayal, love, and hope. It's a must see in my humble opinion be sure to get it for your movie collection.

Before I end this review I wanted to share a few interesting facts about the movie that I found out. The woman who plays Heston's mother Miriam in this one is Martha Scott. She also played his real mother Yochabel  in The Ten Commandments.

Ben Hur never shows Christ's face through the entire movie we always see him from a distance or behind where his face cannot be seen. The reason for this was Wyler wanted it to be ""revent but realist"" and thought that by not showing his face but to show rather the other people's reactions to Jesus was much more profound. And in actuality it worked in this film because the viewer is struck by how people react to Christ but also they are allowed to see him in their mind's eye the way that they perceived him to look and not the way that Hollywood portrayed him to appear.

One last fun fact...One notable change in the film involved the opening titles. Concerned that a roaring Leo the Lion (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet. It was the first time in MGM history that the lion logo was not seen roaring.",1403913600,,3126,4.525663716814159

1335185,4,B00003OSTA,"I bought this set sometime ago (from Amazon) because as a kid I loved the movie along with the great theme & music.  I was in 12th
grade and went on a weekend trip to Chicago with the 11th grade class to see this movie (1960).  Since then I have probably become
more of a critic of this movie than any other.  MGM was beginning to decline as a great studio and this was a good attempt to revive
its market value (I think).  Anyhow, 15 mill was spent on the thing based on the Wallaces book that I read (boy, some job that was!)
and I think very successfully.  It was faithful to the book, beautifully photographed and well  acted with an astounding chariot race
at the end of the film (almost the end; still and hour or so to go). Anyhow, the villain is vanquished, family freed but the well staged
crucifixion of Jesus was the high note and beautifully done.  Few films musical themes moved me as well as the Ben Hur themes from the
beginning birth star to the blood mixing with the water at the end.  I was moved though I am more of a mystical agnostic than religious.  The movie was filmed in what was called Camera 65 (70mm?) and it looked well on the huge screen. I give this movie
four stars only for what I will criticize in a moment.  Still, It is a masterpiece in its present form.
  Here we go.  My primary gripe is that the costumes were not always accurate.  I am a kind of Romanophile and have  dozens
of books (ancient & modern) on Roman, Greek & Egyptian histories.  The soldiers uniforms looked chincy, shields looked made
of tin, and togas were beige, not white.  The sea battle was superbly done, but I don't believe Romans used slaves as rowers;
fiction ideas back in the 1860s when the book was written  (Lew Wallace, Union General).  Want to see good Roman uniforms,
watch FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE; beautifully done costumes.  And if a Roman had a stripe on their togas, it would be
purple, not red; a common error by Hollyweird.  But Heston  & Boyd played off each other very well.  The rest of the cast was
well chosen & scripted.  But can you imagine how well this film might have looked with CGI effects.  Maybe it is just as well.
I am beginning  to tire of CGI in every film today and MGM did a great job with what was available at the time.  And the film is
very respectful to Jesus as it portrayed  the crucifixion.  If you like films with action, spiritual portions and entertainment and
some historical elements, this one is for you.",1403222400,,2464,4.30718954248366

Turns out it's also very long - and i was riveted to my seat for the whole showing. It has it all: action, adventure treachery, suspense, romance, revenge, loyalty, and redemption. It is now a family tradition to watch it every Easter.

I own the DVD release of this film. I decided to make my first Amazon digital streaming purchase and I was impressed by the video and audio quality. I expected the Amazon HD streaming version to be convenient (as I wouldn't have to locate my wife's newest storage place for our DVDs on an annual basis anymore), but it also turned out to be of far superior quality compared to the DVDs.

1335251,3,B00003OSTA,"Virtually anyone reading this book will have seen the movie, which is very faithful to the 19th century novel, penned by a former Union Civil War General named Lew Wallace.  Wallace was disgraced at the Battle of Shiloh, but went on to serve capably and courageously.  Following the war, Wallace pursued a successful political career before penning this work, which is acknowledged as the best selling religiously themed novel in history.

Judah Ben-Hur is born to wealth and privilege as the son of a Jewish merchant in Jerusalem.  His stunning fall and subsequent resurrection has been likened to that of the author, as has his religious awakening, as Ben-Hurs path crosses and recrosses that of Jesus of Nazareth.

Written in the late 19th century, much of the dialogue is in the form spoken during the time of Christ (i.e. sayest thou), but is easily understandable and at times quite beautiful.  Nevertheless, there are periods in the story (most notably during Ben-Hurs sojourn in Antioch) that are mind-numbingly boring as the author spends scores of pages in philosophical contemplation and florid description of the people and places that make up the story.

I saw this on TMC a couple of years ago and thought it just great.  The second time around left me no less impressed.  It has a feeling of really being true to the era in the settings & costumes. Francis X Bushman does not have much charisma in the movie but does his job well as the villain to play off the somewhat 'too nice' Ramon Novarro - who always seems to get a little bit too lucky in all the tough situations he gets himself into.

I must say that the way the film deals with Judah's mother and sister is more powerful than the original.  They almost seem to fall out of Wallace's story and I found it strange.  I also had some difficulty believing Judah's position on who Jesus was and reconciling his actions with his faith.

1335305,5,B00003OSTA,"This is one of the best, most moving, most powerful and most impressive films ever made. Below, more of my impressions, in principle without SPOILERS.

This film is an adaptation of the novel ""Ben Hur: a tale of the Christ"" wirtten in 1880 by Lewis Wallace, a kind of renaissance man, as he was not only a gifted writer but also served, at various times of his life, as a lawyer, a district attorney, a teacher, a state senator and a general during War Between States. At the time of the publication of his most famous novel he was the governor of New Mexico Territory and was busy settling the infamous Lincoln County War.

From the moment of its publication ""Ben Hur"" became the greatest bestseller in USA, replacing the ""Uncle's Tom Cabin"" which held that title since 1852 - and it remained number 1 of sales until 1936 (yes, you read it right), when ""Gone with the wind"" was published! Since its publication ""Ben Hur"" was never out of print.

""Ben Hur"" was first adapted on the screen as soon as first films appeared, in 1907, but this version lasted only 15 minutes and was made on a budget of 500 (five hundred) USD. The only reason that it is not entirely forgotten is that it was made without permission of author's estate and the civil suit that followed its release led to the greatly important judgement establishing the principle that no adaptation can be made of a book without first securing the rights to it.

A second version, made in 1925 with Ramon Novarro in main role, was already a mega-production lasting 143 minutes and cost the enormous (in those times) amount of 4 million dollars. It was the most expensive film of silent era, but it was a huge success and earned a lot of money. Therefore, once sound and colour became available, it was only a question of time for a remake to appear but ultimately it took 34 years before this project was realised. Well, considering the result, it was certainly worth waiting...

For people unfamiliar with the story (assuming that they exist) it is enough to know that this film is about the tribulations of a wealthy and well connected Jewish aristocrat Ben Hur and his family, who live in Judea in times of Christ. Because of some bad luck (and also some bad will of a treacherous villain) Ben Hur and his loved ones get into a lot of trouble with Roman authorities who supervise the occupation of their homeland. That is just the beginning of the story and I will say no more about it.

This film contains of course some grandiose action scenes, including a great (and completely fictitious) naval battle and especially an INCREDIBLE chariot racing sequence, but those are just cherries on the cake as this movie is definitely NOT about action scenes and adventures. In fact, as the undertitle of the film states it loud and clear, this is indeed a ""Tale of the Christ"".

Lewis Wallace was a deeply believing Christian (albeit he refused to join any church, to preserve his freedom) and his book is a deeply Christian tale - but because of his deep faith author decided that Jesus simply couldn't be a character in the book, because it would be not respectful. For that reason, the book tells ""the tale of the Christ"" through the prism of life and tribulations of another character, a Jewish prince - with the main hero appearing seemingly only by distant glimpses, but nevertheless being always immensely present... In this 1959 cinema adaptation the director, William Wyler, respected very strictly this convention and the result is STUNNINGLY PERFECT! I will say no more about it here, you deserve to discover it by yourself.

Another great idea of Lewis Wallace (again respected by William Wyler) was to avoid heavy handed proselytism. SPOILER here: Ben Hur and his kin are all Jews and they remain Jews until the end of the film. With the exception of one secondary (albeit important) character there is no open conversion to the Christianism in neither the book or the film. But Ben Hur of course meets Christ - and in more ways than just the most litteral one...

Even if they never speak and we can never see Christ's face, their first meeting is one of the most incredibly beautiful and moving scenes I EVER saw - and their ultimate meeting is (at least in my understanding) very much influenced by the encounter between Christ and the centurion described in Gospels, during which the Roman officer pronounces those immense and ominous words, repeated since then countless times in homilies: ""Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed"".

The centurion didn't openly accept Christ teachings and neither does Ben Hur in the film - but nevertheless, when they humbly asked, the merciful Lord didn't refuse them... The whole film is absolutely great, but it is the part that begins immediately after this incredible chariot race which is THE REAL TREASURE and possibly the most moving, the most beautiful thing ever shown on the screen.

The whole film is in large part carried by the immense talent of Charlton Heston, with Stephen Boyd portraying a Messala who from the first to the last second of his screen time is one of the most charismatic villains EVER! An authentic Jewish beauty queen (a sabra born in 1931 in what was in this time British Protectorate of Palestine) Haya Harareet is remarkable as Esther, a girl madly in love with Ben Hur since like forever - and veteran British actor Hugh Griffith did a great job as Ilderim, an Arab sheik madly in love with horses...)))

Even for non religious people, this film can be interesting, as it is one of the greatest shows ever made - the music, the action scenes, the grandiose settings, the proud march of Roman soldiers, all this makes this film a quite unique thing. As pure show, it was later matched only by ""Cleopatre"", but ""Ben Hur"" brought to his makers money, instead of financial ruin - maybe as an earthly reward from somebody up there, in heavens, who was probably quite favourably impressed...)))

Still, the WHOLE beauty of this film will most probably be apparent to believing Christians or at least to those familiar with Christian teachings - therefore it can be a good idea to read one of the Gospels (anyone of the four will do) before watching it. It doesn't take much time, it never hurts to remind ourselves the details of the greatest story ever told and it will certainly help understand and enjoy this GREAT, INCREDIBLE MOVIE. So read, watch - and enjoy!",1398124800,,6486,4.678947368421053
1335306,4,B00003OSTA,"The movie follows the book in many details (though not all, of course, like most book-to-movie features).

Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur very well. He really brings out the character's emotions and passions.

The other characters aren't bad either, though sometimes their acting can seem rather drab in comparison.

I think my favorite rendition of this work is 1st - Focus on the Family's audio drama, 2nd - this movie, and 3rd - the book. That is rare, as I usually like the books better. But the other two works bring out the jist of the book without all the long boring parts :)

The movie is rather long, but riveting at the same time. Great for a (very) long movie night, or when you are sick during the day and need to pass time. Not really a ""fun quickie"".",1398038400,,764,4.435714285714286

The book and move were different in several characters/details but both contain a great human interest story.  The book contains much more historical detail - I like history.  It also had a more prolonged story and detail regarding Ben Hur's personal struggle between good vs evil, forgivenesss vs vengeance, peace vs strife,  man's way vs. God's way.

1335340,5,B00003OSTA,"I love this movie but do not call it a biblical masterpiece because it only refers to Jesus and employs several of his life's major incidents(his birth, his sermon on the mount, his trial and cruxifiction). Yes, there are references to Jesus but is the tale of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a wealthy and powerful Jewish man whose life is thrown asunder by the betrayal of a former friend, the Roman Messala (Stephen Boyd), now a tribune. The film is William Wyler's 3.5 hour masterpiece and a rollercoaster ride of emotion. We agonize with Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) as he goes from respected Jewish merchant to galley slave, chariot driver, Roman heir & citizen,to a Jewish subject of Rome. Through this experience he grapples with a promise of love, loss,  anger, revenge, loss, love and restoration. The film's strength is also found in the talented cast that includes Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrias as the toigh but loving Roman consul who saves and adopts Ben-Hur); Haya Harareet as the beautiful and smitten Esther; Hugh Griffith as the jovial and horse-loving Shiek Iderim; Martha Scott as Ben-Hur's loving mother, Miriam; Finlay Currie as the narrator and Balthasar; Sam Jaffe as the loyal steward, Simonedes; Cathy O'Donnell as the waifish Tirzah; and Frank Thring as the egotistical Pontius Pilate.

The cast is helped by the beautiful film score composed by Oscar-winning Miklos Rosza. The two action scenes for which the film is best known: the sea battle and the chariot race were both directed by Andrew marton who won the Oscar for his efforts. The art direction and added to the authenticity of the film and garnered Robert Surtees an Oscar.

colossal crowd scenes fill in between the obvious set pieces--the battle of the galley
ships at sea and of course the chariot race. There are numerous short scenes in
early Technicolor and a new orchestra score (by Carl Davis, an expert in such matters),
and the whole thing is really a treat. It's all very sentimental and even pious--the novel's
subtitle was ""A Tale of the Christ""--but it moves very quickly, so if you're impatient with
the soft material, it won't last long. Still, this isn't an action film alone. There's something

First, this book is very interesting. The author of this book Lew Wallace is a creative author. In this book a boy named Judah is stripped of his wealth and separated from his family. My opinion of this book is it's amazing because he showed bravery in the face of danger.

First, I thought this book was scary since he had to fight another man over a girl. It taught me that you should always be loyal to friends and be of a good courage.

The man had a burnt face from the sun while he was in the middle of nowhere. He did not die because he had a camel to ride on. Later, he visits a village and an old friend that he knew betrayed him so he stays with a girl that likes him.

I recommend you get this book if you like action and adventure. This book is for boys and girls of all ages.",1390780800,,809,3.9753086419753085

Call me a bad judge of art but I love this movie. Despite all the put downs it has received over the years from elite cineastes (it was too long, too woodenly/hammily acted, the religious propaganda was out of place, etc.) I sincerely believe Ben-Hur is one of the greatest epic films ever made. I don't want to sound like some sort of arrogant, know-it-all fanatic or fanboy but Im glad for every single Academy award it won. It was one of the first films that really showed me what movie magic is all aboutmaking you hate the villains, love the heroes, cry and laugh when the characters cry and laugh, making an emotional connection to the storyline-in short feeling like you were there.

I will never understand why so many professional critics say Charlton Heston was a bad bad wooden actor and that his Academy award win was a bad bad judges decision. His rich, majestic voice is always a pleasure to the ears and he does more with one facial expression than Ive seen many actors do with a whole script. I was touched beyond words at his acting and often just wept at his performance. His hatred for Messala, love for his fianc&eacute;, mother and sister and faith in God was so strong. Probably his finest moments were:

1. His 'kick butt' speech to Messala in the beginning.

Judah: I'd rather be a fool than a traitor.

Messala: Judah listen...

Judah: NO YOU LISTEN TO ME!!! ROME is an AFFRONT to GOD! Rome is strangling my people and the whole earth! But not forever! We will rise again! And I tell you the day Rome falls there will be a shout of joy and freedom such as the world has NEVER KNOWN!

The fire in his eyes and the way he gnashes his teeth made me move back in my chair.

2. His conversations with Esther show that he could do subtle as well as melodramatic. I love how he's teasing her in the beginning about ""The wise old days of Solomon when the king saw a girl that filled his eye."" He gets a rather mischievous grin on his face and a twinkle in his eye as he says this which pitches the scene perfectly.

3. The confrontation when he comes back to Messala. Stressing every word ""DON'T DISSAPOINT ME MESSALA."" Once again we get that deadly, steely glare and icy tone.

4. When he's writhing in anguish at the heat of the sun and lack of water. The way he says ""God help me."" The look on his face as he stares at Jesus when he gives him water says so much.

5. The profound, moved, subtle look on his face and resonance in his voice as he accepts the ring of Quintus Arrius.

6. The look on his face as he goes up the stairs at the end when he sees his mother and sister have been healed.

As for Hugh Griffiths Best Supporting Actor oscarwell I tend agree with the 90% of people who saw Ben-Hur and say that Stephen Boyd as Messala was better and should have gotten this award instead. His the emperor is watching us and chilling Look for them in the valley of the lepers if you can recognize them. The race is not over! It goes on! speech really takes the cake. But now that I think about it, it doesnt surprise me that Griffith won it. First of all, the Academy back then wasn't usually in the habit of awarding performances of despicable characters. Hugh Griffith as the Arab merchant who loves horses is the comic relief who lightens the tone of the film and he succeeds completely. Besides, look at his competition. The duo in Anatomy of a Murder most likely cancelled each other out. I haven't seen Robert Vaughn in The Young Philadelphians but this still doesnt change my mind. Then you have Ed Wynn as the dentist in Anne Frank who does practically nothing with a basically nothing role. In short, as far as Ive seen, Griffith was the best of the bunch, thats why he won it.

Haya Harareet gives a beautiful, polished, seamless performance as the quiet, shy, gentle slave girl Esther. My favorite of her scenes is when Miriam is crying in the cave and shrinking away. Harareets face brightens up as she takes hold of Judah and says If they would only see Jesus they would know that life is everlasting and death is nothing to fear if you have faith. Ill take them to him! When no one else would touch Miriam and Tiszah, she came down to their level and risked her life because her love for them prevailed over all fear of disease. I challenge everybody who sees this scene not to hold a handkerchief.

Finlay Currie, Sam Jaffe, Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Jack Hawkins, etc.) all deliver good strong performances that elevate the core values of the film.

Picture and sound editing are crisp and clear, costumes and sets look real and Miklos Rozsa presents a magnificent musical score rich with layers of details and dramatic flourishes. Robert Surtees cinematography is a richly deserved winner. His dark and light shades of brown, sepia, gray and green are absolutely gorgeous. The visual effects (matte paintings and chariot stunts) look very real and put some of our present CGI to shame.

William Wylers direction is absolutely flawless. He brings out the best in every actor and pitches every scene perfectly.

1335563,5,B00003OSTA,"It is full of many of the bad things this earth has faced throughout history: war, revenge, slavery, cruelty, man's inhumanity to mankind.  The Roman's rigidity about laws and their feeling that they are superior to all others - their eagerness to force their
ways upon all others.  However, there is the goodness, the kindness, the mercy, the devotion to one another, and love found in the Hur family.  It was this mercy that the atonement of Jesus Christ brought to the earth.  I am especially fond of the valley of the lepers because there are those on this earth even today who feel as they did - outcasts, rejected by society, not because of leprosy but just because they do not fit the norm of the society in which they live.  Nothing compares to the chariot scenes.",1388534400,,772,4.565217391304348

1335570,5,B00003OSTA,"I saw Ben-Hur the first time in April, 1960 for my 16th birthday.  It was a road show movie -- which meant that you bought a reserved seat ticket a week or two ahead of the showing.  It was in a thousand seat theater which was packed.  It was a rather awesome experience the first time out.  I have seen it many times since over the years, but I have never seen it where it looked or sounded as good as it did that day.  I bought the ""soundtrack"" album (which wasn't really a soundtrack) and loved Miklos Rozsa's score from the beginning.  I bought the sheet music booklet and played it over and over again on the family piano.

When video started in 1976 with the release of Sony's BetaMax (arguably the beginning of the consumer video era), I taped it off the TV.  Later I had an RCA CED disk of it -- then later a LaserDisc -- then finally the first DVD release (which was of the same restored version as the Blu-Ray).  The DVD release is the only one (until the Blu-Ray) that offered the film in a pristine version.

Last night my wife and I watched the new Blu-Ray for the first time.  We have a 96"" HD projected home theater with 7.1 surround.  THIS is the first time in 53 years that Ben-Hur came through like the first time -- video, sound, and the impact of the movie, overall.  It was quite magnificent.  I have been a Blu-Ray naysayer when it comes to ""old"" movies because I thought it didn't make sense to have it in Blu-Ray when the resolution of the original wasn't as good as the Blu-Ray spec.  I was wrong.

The differences between the DVD and the Blu-Ray are not startling.  But the smallest details and the textures of the costumes and details of the set decoration are somehow much more real and vibrant.  So the Blu-Ray is the end of the journey to get back to the original experience of this movie.

AND what I noticed last night is the overall craftsmanship of this production.  It's that total craftsmanship of the entire experience -- actors, music, set decoration, costumes, technical color and sound, etc. that had the impact on us like never since 1960.  It is no wonder that this movie is still the Oscar king.  It is a movie like no other when it comes to all of those details.  Modern CGI might have made some of the matte painting more realistic or might have presented the opening Nativity more realistically but, otherwise, modern technology would not make this movie ""look"" any better.

Bottom line: Blu-Ray -- well processed from restored and cleaned elements (as in this case) -- makes a remarkable difference in restoring the beauty of classic movies which started out as beautiful productions.  I can't think of a movie from the era of road show epics that could profit as much as this one.  To see this movie properly (and from Blu-Ray) is to reproduce a wonderful experience.

PS: for TV's that are 32"" or below, the DVD experience is as good (for me) as the Blu-Ray.  The bigger the screen the more Blu-Ray makes a difference.",1388016000,,2967,4.434380776340111

Charlton Heston & Stephen Boyd co-star as a pair of head-strong young men (one a Jew, the other a Roman), who start out as the best of friends and through a simple, tragic mistake end up as the bitterest of enemies.

Incredibly moving on an emotional & spiritual level, even though it isn't an actual tale from the Bible. The Blu-ray restoration work done here looks magnificent! Everything looks and sounds amazing.

 EDIT: I'm not sure why my review shows up as DVD but I'm referring to the 50th anniversary Blu-ray release which considering the age of the film has quite a great picture and depth & shadow detail is great. Most of the film is brightly lit but the scene after the chariot race when Ben-hur visits Messala the low lit scene looks quite striking. As I mentioned the film is properly framed though there is one scene that shifts/jumps while Ben-hur is talking to Messala in his office not sure which time off the top of my head but I believe its the first time. This may be do to a damaged frame of film I'm not sure. That was the only noticeable framing issue. The 50th anniversary edition also includes a copy of Charlton Heston's daily schedule/diary of the film which was quite interesting I haven't read it completely but its a look behind the scenes in a really raw way.

 Amazon should really Really REALLY stop mixing the Blu-Ray reviews in with the DVD ones neither are a fair representation of the other.",1385683200,,1140,4.466346153846154

1335639,5,B00003OSTA,"I watched this movie from my Dad's VHS collection of old films in California. I was so impressed with it so that I decided to also own this movie in DVD format which I purchased from Amazon. My friends and I were just inspired by it that we decided to give it 5 stars.
  The actors Charlton Heston,Stephen Boyd,Jack Hawkins,Haya Harraret,etc,etc did wonderful performances in our opinion. The movie's beginning shows two childhood friends Messala the Roman and Judah Ben Hur the Hebrew who met each other again as adults. Messala this time became a Roman Tribune. A serious conflict between the two arose when Ben Hur refused Messala's offer to help him capture suspected Jewish conspirators against Rome. Ben Hur refused to be treacherous to his own people or be branded as a traitor.
  One day, a loose tile from the roof of the Hur house fell and accidentally hit a Roman official on the road below. Although innocent, Ben Hur together with his mother and his sister were arrested and imprisoned. BenHur was then sent to the Roman ships (galleys) as one of the enslaved oarsmen. On the way to Rome, the entire ship sank. Ben Hur  managed to save the life of the Roman Ship Commander named Arrius until they were rescued by other Romans. Arrius then later adopted him as a son. This led to his becoming in charge of the horses in the stables and eventually to the magnificent breathtaking 4-horse chariot races in the Circus Maximus (wherever) with BenHur as one of the charioteers.
It so happened that Messala the Tribune was also a charioteer and the two former childhood friends met again as enemies. Since this is a movie review, I will not go further to tell the end or the events leading to the movie's ending.

  One has to watch this movie from its beginning to its ending to fully appreciate its magnificence and beauty. BenHur's encounter with Jesus Christ earlier and then up to His crucifixion is unquestionably very inspiring. It is also fascinating to watch officials climbing certain steps to get to the top of the magninicent buildings (there were no elevators of today then) in order to give the signals that the race is about to begin. The blaring of multiple Roman trumpets to announce the appearance of the Roman emperor was very majestic. Then during this brutalizing race, there were chariot accidents with serious injuries (even being trampled). The appearance of the Roman ""paramedics or ambulances (very ambulatory indeed) "" to get the injured safely out of the tracks are thrilling to watch. One reviewer actually said that one of these Hollywood stuntmen sustained serious injuries during the filming. The filming it was said was made in Rome or somewhere in Italy (not Hollywood) and no ""green screens"" were used. At that time there were also no computer generated tricks that could be used. The closeups and the audio and the editing,etc,were just amazing as the risks taken to film the chariot race.

  Some reviewers are actual movie filming technology experts and some of their criticisms appear valid. The task of judging the movie for its PRECISE OPTIMAL TECHNOLOGY belongs to these professionals which certainly is not me or not most of us. However,the good quality of the video-audio of my DVD copy (not BluRay) as well as the MESSAGE that this movie brings are sufficient enough for us to give it 5 stars. We recommend young or old to watch this outstanding movie. We believe that however old the movie maybe, it will never be forgotten.",1385164800,,3476,4.786310517529215

From near darkness to bright landscapes. And to the Arena. 15 mins into that second disc, the race begins. A spectacle of a movie. Intellectually engaging as well as emotionally powerful.

The use of CGI and gamer sequence action might be impressive, but this was real actors in real action sequences. Although Ben Hur is a fictional character and written to fit in to biblical sequences, for spiritual audiences the messages of the bible such as being washed in the blood of Christ cleansing the believer of all sins is dramatically and powerfully brought to the fore.

1335681,5,B00003OSTA,"I've been wanting to read this book for years as I had always been a fan of the movie and consider it in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  Imagine my surprise at how vastly different this novel is from the movie.  Both are good in their own way - but the novel version is hands down a better story as well as more realistic.

The writing is superb - written in 19th century style english, which puts the reader in the center of the story as if he or she were observers on the scene.  I also like the scenes of pagan imagery that General Wallace paints as Ben Hur experiences them in Antioch as well as the stories he hears from one of his romantic interests.  The reason this was done I think was to show the difference between the polytheistic culture of the time and the monotheistic Jewish religion as well as the coming Christian tide that would soon sweep the region and later the world.  Clearly the good general was attempting to show that the pagans worshiped for self-pleasure, the Jews for retribution and conquest, and that what was coming with Jesus' death and resurrection was to be represented by worship expressed by drawing close to God through his Son.

The story itself was a wonderful and classic tale of good and evil with characters you loved and hated.  It is a journey of transformation from worldliness, self-satisfaction, revenge to a life centered on love, forgiveness, and family.",1383004800,,1413,4.535433070866142

1335756,4,B00003OSTA,"Tied as the biggest Academy Award winner with 11 Oscars, Ben-Hur is not one of the best movies of all time. It isn't even a particularly good epic. But it is a compelling and often entertaining story of one (fictional) man's terrible ordeal in biblical times that contains at its centerpiece arguably the greatest action sequence ever presented on the screen. William Wyler directed Charlton Heston in the role of his career as the title character, Judah Ben-Hur, a Hebrew nobleman unjustly sent to presumed death as a slave oarsman in the Roman fleet, but who survives to wreak revenge on the boyhood friend and ambitious official who betrayed and condemned him. Heston won Best Actor that year, but he was outshone by a trio of supporting cast members: Steven Boyd as Messala, his rival and enemy; Jack Hawkins as a Roman counsel; and the great Irish actor Hugh Griffith, who stole the movie - and won his own Oscar - playing an Arab sheikh. Ben-Hur is most famous, and justifiably so, for its chariot race, which is a shot-by-shot replica of the 1925 silent version (both race sequences were directed by legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt, whose son was injured while executing a difficult maneuver during the shoot), and it is absolutely riveting in widescreen and color. The movie used no computer-generated horses or effects, or even the old-fashioned rear-projection technique, which was popular at the time, and which filmed actors in a studio against a screen receiving a separate projected image. Instead, co-stars Heston and Boyd, the stuntmen and the camera crew - and the horses - spent days and days in the hot sun outside Rome shooting the sequence for real, and the effort shows. Take or leave Ben-Hur after that, but don't miss the race - it's a moviemaking triumph. With Sam Jaffe as Judah's trusted manservant, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as his love interest, Kathy O'Donnell (who played Wilma in Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives) as his sister, and Martha Scott as his mother. The darkly stirring score is by Miklos Rozsa.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377475200,,2297,5.383333333333334

For years I searched for a leatherbound copy of Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ because my husband is an avid reader of the classics. When I found this copy, I thought I was buying a nice used version bound in leather, but what I got was a pristine, like new Easton Press un-edited copy of the real story of Ben Hur, as written by the Civil war general (Lew Wallace). Anyone who appreciates Ben Hur as a film, will be compelled to read this story with all the details included. There are differences in some of the chacters, but they simply serve to inform us of the detailed thinking and the deep faith of rhe author. The main theme of this fabulous story is the same and for anyone who has not read Ben Hur, I promise you that doing so will be a thought provoking and satisfying experience. This book will become an heirloom in our library of fine novels.

1335836,5,B00003OSTA,"Review of Ben-Hur: The Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray (1959); Directed by William Wyler, starring Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Sam Jaffe, and Finlay Currie.

MOVIE (5/5): BEN-HUR (1959) has rightly been recognized as one of the greatest movies of all time; an epic that is grand and spectacular in scale and yet one that is human and touching. It has been honored 11 out of 12 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It has been honored by the New York Film Critics Circle, and the American Film Institute (AFI) as one of the 100 greatest American films of all time; and rightly so. It utilizes the best of talents, from the brilliant acting of Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur and Stephen Boyd as Messala to William Wyler's wonderful direction. For those who don't know the plot, BEN-HUR is the story of a Jewish prince named Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), who sees his old-time friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who has become a Roman general. When Ben-Hur is pressured by Messala to reveal the names of dissidents, he refuses, and thus the friendship breaks. Soon, when a tile accidentally falls on the Roman governor, Ben-Hur is immediately taken away, along with his mother and sister. He is condemned to the galleys, where he later saves the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) during a raid on the Roman ship. The following events ensue into a climactic and exciting film, even though it may have moments of dragging and wooden acting. As Fraser Heston, son of Charlton, noted in one of the featurettes, the film was probably the first modern epic that paved the way for SPARTACUS and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. It is not merely epic in special effects and cinematography (which is rich in its super-wide 2.76 ratio as well as its 70mm quality); it is epic in scope and script, with characters that are both larger-than-life and yet human like us. Particularly interesting is the role of Christ in this movie. His face is never shown, he is not heard speaking, and he appears only several times in the movie, and yet his performance is powerful, and his influence is seen throughout Ben-Hur's life even as his face is not shown before us. William Wyler directs this film with passion, Karl Tunberg's script is excellent (with uncredited contributions from Christopher Fry, Gore Vidal, and Maxwell Anderson to polish it), and Robert Surtees's cinematographic work pays off. All in all, highly recommended. Five out of five stars.

PICTURE QUALITY (5/5): The Blu-ray transfer I see is far, far different from the transfer I see on the iTunes version I possess. The blacks are much more defined, there is much more contrast, and the picture is very crisp, almost like the original 65mm film from whence it came. The 2.76:1 aspect ratio (one of the widest of wide ratios) is too wide for even a 2.40 home theater screen; it can only be seen on a special screen for a special occasion (such as the original 1959 premiere in New York City) to get the full effect. However, we will have to be content with one of the finest Blu-ray transfers of all time. Scanned frame-by-frame at 8K from the original 65mm camera negative (which was almost unrepairable), Warner Bros. put lots and lots of effort into this Blu-ray release. There is not much sign of artificiality; having said that, however, there is much contrast and darkness in the dark scenes; the transfer might not be for everyone, but most people will enjoy it and will cherish it for years to come (until Warner Bros. creates a 4K home-video transfer in the future, where we will see more detail).

AUDIO QUALITY (5/5): Mikios Rozsa's majestic score is beautifully transmuted into the 5.1 DTS HD Master-Audio format, scanned from the original audio negative by masters of restoration. The tone is epic and loud, and the whole sound of it burst through my speakers. i particularly liked the music from the overture, the intermission, and the entr'acte. Even the softer sounds can be heard very clearly. The audio transfer makes it sound clean, and yet, at the same time, it doesn't feel too much like a new film; it still has that old-school Hollywood flair. As the Blu-ray.com review of this release ([...] notes, ""M-G-M has obviously kept the original stems and mag tracks of this film in more or less pristine condition, and it shows throughout this stunning lossless presentation. From the first boisterous moments of Rozsa's incredible Overture, the difference, especially with regard to the low end frequencies, is instantly audible and incredibly fulsome. The 5.1 track is gorgeously spacious, with excellent use of side and rear channels, especially in some of the film's most famous set pieces, including the galley scenes and of course the iconic chariot race, which is awash in LFE and incredible panning effects."" All in all, one of the best audio transfers of a classic movie score.

EXTRAS (no review): To be honest, I haven't seen any of the extras, so I can't grade them. I also haven't seen the 1925 version, which I will have to do.

CONCLUSION (5/5): A fine Blu-ray release of one of the greatest films of all time ever released by Hollywood, on the level of CITIZEN KANE, GONE WITH THE WIND, THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies, and all other Hollywood masterpieces and classics. If you can afford Blu-ray, you won't regret investing in this worthy release.

UPDATE (August 18, 2013): I finally got to the original 1925 silent version, and I liked it just as much, if not more, than the masterpiece that was the 1959 version. While I would still keep my 5/5 rating for that movie, I would give a very high 4 1/2 out of 5-star rating. I would also like to note one scene which indeed surpasses the new version. While the 1959's battle at the sea was indeed epic and masterful, the 1925 version is brilliantly chaotic and we even get to have a light connection with the pirates who are raiding the Roman fleets, which we didn't get in the 1959 version. Also, while this film is indeed black-and-white (and silent), it is also laden with color sequences, particularly in the brilliant ending.

I absolutely recommend this film, as this is my first silent film.

I haven't seen the other extras yet, but from what I saw, I give this a 4.5/5 instead of a perfect five-star rating, both because it's not as epic as the 1959 classic (which I hold to be slightly superior) and because it's not in 1080p HD. However, even though its not in HD, the restoration was good and the folks who did it put lots and lots of effort in bringing back a forgotten rendition of the timeless epic masterpiece that was Lew Wallace's BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST.",1374278400,,6659,4.75930735930736

To such detail that the story of Judah tends to get lost in it. Don't expect the movie, which I love, as the movie focuses on the characters, oddly enough, more than the book does.

Since then it has become largely shunned by the entertainment world, though it is a much better movie and more appropriate for Easter broadcasting over the networks than Cecil B.

1335932,5,B00003OSTA,"I haven't seen Ben-Hur in ages, and one day I'm lying on the couch watching TV and it hits me: I want to see Ben-Hur.  So, I went to Amazon.com and found this great box set.  It comes with a lovely photo album of stills from the movie and casual shots of Charlton Heston with his family on the set.  I really enjoyed seeing the human side of a great American film star in the classic mold.  Combined with Heston's personal diary which he kept on the set of The Ten Commandments, you learn a lot about the man himself.  I've seen comments disparaging the film as too long (one reviewer complains bitterly about having to listen to the ten-minute musical introduction), as being boring (another reviewer said three of four viewers fell asleep during the movie), and as being a ridiculously cornball Sunday School story (this reviewer also complained that Messala's friendship with Judah had homosexual overtones).  It seems to me that these reviewers must be younger viewers who never lived the wonder of a great movie house showing this film.  The ten-minute opening music gave latecomers a chance to find their seats and patrons a chance to get their popcorn, candy, and drinks at the snack bar without missing the first part of the movie.  The intermission music gave patrons a chance to stretch their legs, take a bathroom break, and get a drink at the water fountain.  This film is the product of a movie-going culture that the reviewers I've mentioned seem to know nothing about.  I'm sad they missed it; it was a wonderful time to go to the movies.  Unlike contemporary action films with nonstop car chases and fast cuts from scene to scene, this movie takes its time to develop character, to establish the old friendship before Messala's betrayal of Judah and his family, to show what Judah suffers and make us, the viewers, want revenge as badly as Judah does. Romantic interest is a must, even in modern film, so the relationship between Judah and Esther is simply part of the history of film right from the very beginning of the art form.  And yes, the story is ultimately religious, depicting one family's conversion to Christianity and the miracles that Jesus promised to believers, in this case, healing Judah's mother and sister of leprosy (the New Testament reports Jesus curing lepers during his ministry) and healing Judah's heart of hate and revenge.  It may seem strange to younger people in our present society, but people in 1959 took religion and the Bible much more seriously than they do today.  There was nothing odd about going to see a movie that included biblical themes.  From 1949 to 1965 Hollywood made The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, Samson and Delilah, Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Big Fisherman, King of Kings, Barabbas, The Shoes of the Fisherman, The Gospel According to St. Matthew, and The Greatest Story Ever Told.  People went to watch them, and some of them won Oscars for best picture: Quo Vadis, The Ten Commandments, The Robe, and Ben Hur, which won 11 that year, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Charlton Heston).  As for the supposed ""homosexual overtones,"" it saddens me to see how modern culture has tainted people's perceptions of this classic film and it's ""good triumphs over evil"" message.  Frankly, in 1959, few, if any, children knew what homosexuality was, and polite society didn't talk about it or tolerate it much in their movies.  What a contrast between generations!",1370390400,,3442,4.813242784380305

1335934,1,B00003OSTA,"This is a great movie it's one of those you will either want to re-watch or never see again, If it fails to grab you its length and subject will bore you.
The film goes so much deeper than just the action in the chariot race and sea battle but, if you are looking for constant action you will not find it here however, you will find a great story of the criss crossing of cultures and lives during a very volatile time and which does not wander too far from the original story.
The visual representation has allowed many of the very detailed descriptions in the book to be presented without slowing the progression of the story.
Perhaps a bit dated in style by todays movie standards but great acting, story and music fully deserving of 11 Academy Awards.
The problem I find is with the way Amazon is mixing reviews of the standard disk with those of the blue ray.
I was thinking of upgrading my disk bought many years ago to the blue ray version and as usual I read the worst reviews to see what problems had been experienced, it was then that I realized that the reviews were the same ones for both the standard and blue ray disks.
This confuses the prospective purchaser when comments are made about picture quality and soundtrack. One reviewer commented on the need to turn the disk over as the movie was half on each side, not a deal breaker but my current disk is like this and it can be annoying however, I suspect the blue ray version is not like this because of the greater disk capacity.
Why 1 star? So that people like myself who always read the 1 star first will be made aware that the 2 different formats have used the same reviews, for the movie, 10 stars",1370304000,,1669,4.318471337579618

Soon he is doomed to a life rowing on a galley but on the way there a kind , mysterious stranger gives him a drink to quench his thirst. It takes a few years but Hur's fortune turns and he is no longer a slave but a great chariot racer. The time comes to seek revenge and he beats his former friend in the ultimate chariot race. However, his victory is short lived since he learns his kin are now lepers and the man who showed him kindness years before is now to be crucified. Returning the favor, he gives the suffering man water before He is hung on the cross. Despite the man's death, miraculously his mother and sister are freed from leprosy.

The 1959 version was at an end of the era of the epics that Hollywood had started to make in the silent era.  Pictures became so expensive to make that epics shrunk.  Modern Hollywood makes a series of smaller films-such as The Lord of the Rings-with the entire series an epic.  Hollywood can be proud of the great epics and this film in paticular.  It is a great film-to be savored over many viewings.  MGM spent a lot of money on this film and it shows.

1336056,5,B00003OSTA,I had of course seen the film several times but decided to read the book.  The descriptions of places and move through time are much more developed in the book and the characters are different and fascinating.....,1366156800,,213,4.756756756756757
1336057,5,B00003OSTA,A wonderful treat to see both versions and what went into their production.  The early versions set a standard for innovation and thrill to see.,1366070400,,144,4.76
1336058,4,B00003OSTA,"Bought this ""SPECIAL""  Blu-Ray Edition because I wanted a handier package than my old Laser Disc edition from the early '80's and also hoping for maybe a possibly improved look if it was in anyway possible with today's technologies. Well, as for the ""improved"" look as I was hoping for, I can't find any !!  The extra's in this package are a very nice addition, but as for the presentation of the old Laser Disc edition, I must say these old discs were quality wise very well made but heavy physically of course. I had no way of comparing these 2 editions side by side, but I took the time to watch these 2 movies one after the other and
found no direct obvious improvement in quality and sound since I played them BOTH now through my Onkyo TX - NR5008  AV
receiver and both sound set on NRL THX Cinema surround.

I had exactly the same experience when I was comparing my old
Laser Disc version of The God Father and the  Blu-Ray Special Edition with each other in the same way. There was no obvious
difference in presentation as to whether there were additions or omissions of scenes etc. etc. and in picture quality. That tells me that there is obviously not much you can improve upon when it comes to WELL MADE old movies. If it was not for the price that these Special Edition Blu-Ray's were offered for, I would not have bought them. These old Lasers have still some sentimental
value for me !  Of course the prices of laser discs especially for those days were pretty steep. As a comparison, the Special Edition
Blu-Ray of The God Father cost me only $17.99 at Amazon and the Laser Disc edition had cost me about $120.- and the Ben-Hur
L.D. cost me in those days about $80.-  As the movies are concerned, they are still examples of high quality Hollywood film making that are not seen anymore these days.",1365984000,,1810,4.4174174174174174
1336059,5,B00003OSTA,"My son had been looking for an unabridged copy for a while, and the price was great.  He really likes the classics.",1365984000,,115,4.2272727272727275
1336060,5,B00003OSTA,"I absolutely love this film and I'm ordering it on DVD today. Can anyone tell me if it has a""commentary"" included in its SPECIAL FEATURES?  I'm buying it, regardless, but I sure hope there is a commentary.",1365897600,,205,4.54054054054054
1336071,4,B00003OSTA,I was curious since there was a new Ben Hur on TV.  I had seen the original as a kid.  It is amazing what was done without CGI.  I was able to appreciate the difference after 60 years and I think the newer versio n suffered for not including more of the Christ in the narrative.  This is true in the movues of today unfortunately.,1365897600,,330,4.030769230769231
1336072,4,B00003OSTA,"One of Wyler's best and also Heston's, Ben-Hur holds up well almost a half century later. The blu-ray transfer is pristine, video and audio alike. This was a groundbreaker for reality of sets and costumes; the chariot race looks realer than ever, the clothes as well. There's some stilted dialogue and Heston does overact at times, but all in all it's a classic, though it certainly does take some patience at points. Wyler liked it big and long, and he got all of that and more here, in the end.

But unless you are a major super-fan of this film, the 4-disc version is not worth four times the price of the 2-disc. The picture book is nice but hardly revelatory, likewise Chuck's journals. Nothing really earth-shattering in either, and mainly for collectors only. And while the extra discs have some fine docs and interviews, the best being the story of Heston's life through his son's eyes, but at four times the price of the movie, there's not much value there. Seeing the original silent Ben Hur is alright, if only to see how Wyler's version is so incredibly similar, almost scene for scene at times.

Unless you worship this flick, in which case the packaging and extras will be like the Second Coming for you, except in this case Ben Hur has been repackaged so often it's more like the Ninth Coming.

And for any Monty Python fans out there, watch this and then Brian and you will see how this film is clearly the template for their masterwork. (And the early ads for LOB did say, ""Makes Ben Hur look like an epic!"" No arguing that.) Seeing both films makes each seem even better, in some odd way. Highly recommended.",1365638400,,1626,4.561643835616438
1336073,2,B00003OSTA,"The movie is great, as usual, but the quality of the recording was bad.  There were a lot of blurrs, skips, and stutters.",1365638400,,121,4.260869565217392
1336074,5,B00003OSTA,"The true test of a classic is when it stands the test of time. This is certainly true of William Wyler's epic version of Lew Wallace's classic text. Beautifully shot and staged, without the 'benefit' of CGI (if we can call this technique beneficial) with a terrific score, the film is a visual and aural feast, living proof of what Hollywood could do if they really tried hard enough. The performances are just wonderful, ranging from Charlton Heston's pain-racked central character to Stephen Boyd's hissable villain, Jack Hawkins' confused consul, and Finlay Currie as the evangelical like Balthazar.  In terms of late 1950s history, BEN HUR has a lot to say about the consequences of tyranny, and how willing subjection to the ruling ideology is the first step on the road to corruption.  However it's not always easy to resist, especially when faced with overwhelming forces of colonization.  Despite the difficulties involved, Ben Hur comes to understand this by the end of the film; what's perhaps more important, however, is that he realizes the futility of violence.  The only way to end conflict is through peaceful means, not through further fighting.  Would that Anerica and the Soviet Union had perhaps understood this better - especially at the time BEN HUR was released.  Perhaps the Cold War might have ended over three decades earlier.  Gore Vidal's screenplay for the film also contains strong overtones of homosexuality: there's a closer relationship between Ben Hur and Messala (Boyd) than either of them would like to suggest.  However this kind of love cannot be permitted to flourish, and eventually turns to hate.  In a more peaceful world human beings might be allowed to express themselves more freely.",1365638400,,1727,5.074204946996466

1336080,5,B00003OSTA,"I saw the chariot race when I was younger and watched it recently on Youtube and got interested in the entire movie.  This movie is fantastic and way ahead of its time back in 1959.  Though it is about 3.5 hrs, there was no lull or drop in action for the duration of the movie.  This is a classic and may tie The Ten Commandments as Heston's best work.",1365465600,,352,4.072463768115942

1336103,4,B00003OSTA,The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5stars is the ending. The end prevents me from recommending this film to others. I was so impressed with Charles' acting and the storyline and elaborate sets kept me glued to the screen. The last half-hour is really over-the-top cheesy and disappointed me with what could've been a different stellar memorable ending.,1365120000,,363,4.967213114754099

It also shows quite clearly that people 2000 years ago were just like people now, only they didn't have computers to order movies on Amazon.  Same egos, same desires, same fears, same sinking feeling when you lose a friend to ambition, or when you can't protect your family from something awful, same helpless rage when you get steamrolled to suit somebody else's agenda.  Same choices:  do you give up, or keep fighting?  Keep fighting.  Always keep fighting for what you know is right.  Good job, Chuck.",1364515200,,683,4.728813559322034

1336208,5,B00003OSTA,"I borrowed a dvd copy from the library, and compared it, side by side with this 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition.
Here's what I noticed right at the start:

First -  there is no screen jitter.  For example, on the DVD you can see the title slightly move back and forth, which is typical for older movies that I would watch on DVD.  The Blu-Ray doesn't have any jitter at all.  It's perfectly still, and looks amazing

Second - The DVD is not a bad experience, but you can notice grainy image.  Compared to the Blu-Ray, the difference is shocking.  All the edges are crisp and clean, and the colors are incredible.

On another note, the commentary is really cool too!  Charlton Heston provides some awesome insights.

Yes, the acting is a bit more theatrical than modern viewers might be used to or comfortable with, but the richness of the colors, the beauty of the landscapes and set design, the sheer magnitude of the production is almost overwhelming.

The star I took off is for the actual film being a little slow, but there really is nothing the collection can do about it, as it is one of the most well-regarded movies of all time.

Also, the box I got had a dented edge, not enough for me to bother sending it back (I don't maintain a museum) but it might dissatisfy serious collectors.

I am only 20 years old, hardly the target audience for this film, but I enjoyed the presentation anyway. Many iconic moments. If you want to see the Chariot race, it's near the beginning of Disc 2.

From a slave in the galley to a believer in Jesuswhat more can we say.

1336268,5,B00003OSTA,"Released in 1959, Ben Hur defines the EPIC movie genre.  It is certainly 5-stars, perhaps worth another star for acting and the epic quality this film embodies.  The movie won a record 11 Academy Awards, (including Best Picture) a record that would stand until Titanic (another epic).  Charlton Heston givea perhaps the defining performance of his long and illustrious career.  He simply dominates this movie as Judah Ben Hur.  His brilliant range as an actor is clearly evident throughout the 3 and 1/2 hours of this film.

The story of Ben Hur is one that absolutely captivates the imagination of the viewer.  This is a story with many themes: the bitter struggle between opposing cultures, a touching love story, an epic adventure story, and the story of the Messiah all rolled into one epic movie.  The sets are incredibly expansive, a visual wonder, and it appears that no dollar was spared in replicating the Roman Empire era.  The costumes, lighting, and production values are superb, unequaled to that time in film history.  Heston is the obvious star, but the supporting cast is brilliant as well, making this movie thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing.  Although 3 and 1/2 hours long, one cherishes every minute.  There are no ""boring"" sequences - each scene is carefully and artfully directed by Academy Award winner William Wyler.

This is a decidedly Christian film and is perhaps best viewed for maximum effect at Easter time.

Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.  Yes, there are epic films being made today, but none with the scope of incomparable Ben Hur.  Set aside an evening to watch this historically epic film.  Best of all, it is suitable for the entire family.

Music can make or break a film and the Miklos Rosza score to Ben Hur provides many beautiful themes and a deep range of feeling tones that make the film experience one of the best.

1336381,4,B00003OSTA,"One of my favorite movies. Please be aware that this Blu-ray edition is widely misrepresented on Amazon.com and on many other web sites as well. It appears as several different products with different prices (e.g., a 2-disc ""ultimate collector's edition,"" which is actually Wal-Mart's misrepresented version of this simpler 2-disc set) and different release dates in 2011 and 2012, but most of the 2-disc sets are really the same simplified 2011 package.

The movie is presented on two Blu-ray discs, each with half of the movie on it. The special features for these discs are the same as from the movie discs in larger Blu-ray sets (3-disc, 4-disc, etc.): Commentary by Hatcher and Heston, Music-only track, and theatrical trailers. (Presently, Amazon says there are no special features.) Another point of confusion is the film's aspect ratio. It's actually 2.76:1. That said, I was unable to input that into Amazon's online form for updating product info, since it only allows a small set of incorrect choices for aspect ratio. A third point of confusion is the language tracks. This edition only has three: English (SDH) 5.1, Spanish 5.1, and French 5.1. Some available Blu-ray editions have many more, but I've found it next to impossible to correctly identify them. The price for this 2-disc set varies wildly, making it all the more difficult to correctly distinguish it from larger and more expensive sets. The running time is listed on the case as 222 minutes, not 212. The graphics on the back of the case do suggest that this presentation is region-free - another detail which incorrectly varies among listings.

Amazon has been repeatedly made aware of these problems. Getting them addressed has been an unnecessarily difficult and lengthy process. I've been fairly compensated. However, time will tell if Amazon can straighten this all out and make it easier for customers to submit corrections. What customer service has done is issue credits, flag one of two product listings I complained about, and pass along complaints to other departments (where they might or might not lead to action - action which I'm told will take at least a week, maybe many weeks). I really hope this all gets fixed and have done all I can to help that along. But it's hard to ignore how big the problem is and how much easier it would be to do nothing about it.

I've been ordering movies online for years. Inaccurate product descriptions are unfortunately common. But Ben-Hur on Blu-ray is associated with the biggest mess of this kind that I've seen yet.",1358121600,,2548,4.9485981308411215

1336383,3,B00003OSTA,"Years ago, I bought a second hand book of ""Ben Hur"".  It must have been based on the movie version of this story and it was great.  I would give that version 5 stars.  I no longer have that book so when I saw the Kindle edition, I was so excited that I could read ""Ben Hur"" again.  This original edition was not as good a read.  It was ponderous reading & to me--boring at times.  There was a lot more in -depth information on all the characters but just pages and pages of it.!  At the time that the original was written, all of the detailed scenic info was probably more appreciated.  Most people back then would not have seen much of the world nor knew of these far off places.  Having seen the movie first, I was surprised at several of the differences between book & movie.  One as noted by another reviewer, was Messala surviving the chariot race.  Also how young Ben Hur & Messala were when the betrayal took place.  There were other numerous differences.  It is still a classic book to read.  Plus, thank goodness it was written.  If not, the great movie with Chalton Heston & Steven Boyd would not have been made.  That movie is one of the best ever produced,in my opinion.  I would still like to purchase the book based on the movie, if I can ever find it again. I am glad to have read the Kindle edition as it is a good story.",1357948800,,1337,4.200787401574803

1336539,5,B00003OSTA,"Just for clarification, I am writing a review of the 2 disk Bluray 50th Anniversary Edition only and not the box set.

I just watched this film for the first time, and I must say... How did I not know about this great film?
I am still a college student, so most of my friends prefer movies more in the ""popcorn flick"" style, but I have always been a fan of classics. This is probably one of the more understated classics, as I discovered it on a Bluray sale on Amazon and had never heard of it before. After a little research on ye olde Rotten Tomatoes and a few other reviews, I just went for it, and I am glad to now have this as part of my collection.

STORY

The story takes place in biblical times and covers Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince who grew up with the childhood friend, Messalla, who went on to join the Roman empire, and you can probably already guess that there would be conflict there. It is sort of a classic tale of revenge and forgiveness, and that is probably all I want to reveal.. I hate spoilers. I will say that the movie advertises as being a Christian film, which it is in a way, but not really ""in your face"" about it. You do see Jesus, but it is filmed in a very classy manor and leaves some mystery behind who Jesus actually was, instead focusing on Ben-Hur, his family, and his arch-nemesis, Messalla.

There are some amazing scenes in this film, including the infamous chariot race, and another one of my personal favorites, the battleship scenes.

All that said, the film is quite long at over 4 hours, and I recommend watching it in two sittings, stopping at the intermission.

Bluray

The Bluray was done VERY well. You can tell that this is a complete restoration, and I read that they spent a LONG time restoring it cell by cell from the master film reel. It shows. The picture is amazing. There were a few hiccups throughout the film, likely where the master film had to be spliced, but it is nothing major. This is probably the only way to watch this film anymore, as I am sure any previous versions pale in comparison.

Please note that the only extras included are an audio commentary and two trailers, as well as a separate music track. If you are looking for extras, you are going to want to splurge on the boxed version.

Overall

To sum up my review, this is a great film. It is a little long and a little drawn out at parts, but some of these scenes are just unspeakably good.",1348790400,,2416,4.3017621145374445

1336551,5,B00003OSTA,This book arrived in great condition considering its age 1880!!!!  I would order from this vendor again without hesitation! Thannks for the great deal!,1347926400,,151,5.291666666666667
1336552,5,B00003OSTA,"When this film was made, the movie studios were concerned about something called 'TV' and wanted to make a film that was just 'too big' for the little screen.  Well, they did it, and Ben Hur (the 1959 re-make) resulted.  11 Academy Awards in a year with several excellent competitors says it all.

The movie was based on a mundane book by General Lew Wallace.  He was a small player in the Civil War, but some believe he saved the nation.  During Confederate Jubal Early's surprise offensive towards Washington, there was nothing to block them.  While General Grant slowly sailed men to man the parapets about Washington, General Wallace was given hospital patients, clerks, orderlies, and roustabouts.  He led them to the front and fought a losing but delaying battle, giving Grant's rescuing reinforcements just enough time to sail up the Potomac and man the forts, along with one certain president.

This film has as a backdrop the ascendancy and cruxifiction of the Christ.  It is omnipresent but doesn't dominate every scene.  Running parallel to that theme is the other plot: the effect of Rome upon its rulers and its subjects.  Judah-ben-hur is a successful businessperson who is confronted with the return to Judea of his youthful friend, now corrupted by power (Rome).  Right out of WW2 Germany, Judah is asked to give up his friends and neighbors, those who would question Roman authority.  Judah refuses and suffers the consequences.  The two themes (the Christ and power's corruption of men) then intersect in powerful and affective ways.  Too many reviewers have 'ruined it' for 1st time viewers, so I won't go further.

This film is considered one of the greats by the Library of Congress, the Vatican, and any film reviewer of note.  If you haven't seen it or want it at your fingertips, then it's a must have, either this version or the blue-ray version just out.",1347926400,,1880,4.861635220125786

1336555,5,B00003OSTA,"Unafflicted with flash cuts, whip pans, handheld closeups, or meticulous Computer-Generated imagery and action, I'm sure many of today's audiences would find ""Ben-Hur"" unwatchable-- its major drawback, of course, is that it actually has to be WATCHED, paid attention to; its secondary drawback is that its theme is about faith, very uncool and awkward in today's Political Correctivism society. Yet its subplots-- a Roman master bonding with a Jewish slave, a Jewish charioteer bonding with an Arab, a Jewish aristocrat falling in love with a Jewish servant, even a homoerotic love-turning-to-hate relationship between a Roman and Jew-- all push the Politically Correct envelope even today, and remain relevant. Add in the fact that car chases from ""Bullitt"" to ""Bourne"" owe a tremendous debt to the chariot race in ""Ben-Hur"", and you have a film more than worth watching, you have a film that SHOULD be watched. ""Ben-Hur"" is a monument to the outdated concept that art and craft are at least as important as audience in the creation of a motion picture.",1346889600,,1054,5.133720930232558

1336572,4,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ tells the fictional  story of the first-century Jew Judah Ben-Hur, who as a young man is betrayed by his best friend, Messala.  This betrayal changes Ben-Hur forever, as he finds himself rising from a slave aboard a ship to one of the most rich and powerful men in the Roman Empire, to the commander of a volunteer army, and finally to the status of worshiper at the foot of the Cross on Golgotha.  Author Lew Wallace paints an interesting picture of how God might have chosen to work in one man for the glory of His kingdom.

There is much commendable in Ben-Hur.  Wallace took his Christian faith seriously, and as a result spent much time studying the geography, politics and general way of life of first-century Rome and Jerusalem making his novel as historically accurate as he could.  Wallace also did an exceptional job writing about the eyewitness accounts of the Christ.  As people far removed from the events of the New Testament, it is easy to nonchalantly affirm that Jesus really did the things contained therein.  But imagine the excitement that would emanate from inside of you if you watched a man heal your own family from leprosy, or raise a man from the dead!  Lewis captured this sense of excitement and awe that must have been present for those who really saw such events.  Moving on, the plot of the book is well-written, with a compelling main story and interconnected subplots, each of which keeping one's interest.  Many of the characters were relatable, too; I kept wondering in between reading sessions what was the fate of Ben-Hur's mother and sister.

If I had to present a criticism of this  book, it would be as follows: First, while there was at least one plot twist I didn't see coming, for the most part it wasn't too hard to see where the story was going.  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but a bit more suspense would have been nice.  Second, although I think Wallace presented a portrait of Christ that was ""historically accurate"" for his day, it's highly unlikely (as in 100%) that Jesus was a feminine-looking, long-haired, blue-eyed white guy.  I suppose I can forgive him that, though, as he was writing in the 1890s.  My only other complaint was his portrayal of Joseph as someone with the personality of a felled tree.  That just came out of nowhere, and it probably hurt the story more than it helped.

All in all, this is a good book to read for both the Christian and non-Christian alike.  It is a solid story, it is a fun read, and it's good motivation to re-watch the Charlton Heston film, too!",1342137600,,2581,4.606126914660831
1336573,4,B00003OSTA,"For those like me who like this film but not to the extent of getting the full-blown collectors' version we get here a truly stripped-down but mostly satisfying version of one of the great epic films.  No expense was spared in what would probably cost a fraction to produce what with CGI today but clearly was a tremendous undertaking in 1959.  There are many memorable scenes here such as the battle at sea and the chariot race but also the less exciting tender scenes among Ben-Hur and his family showcase just how good the quality of the cast is.  For a 53-year old film the 1080p transfer represents the best picture transfer of the film to date; while certainly not reference quality it is still a worthy effort for the most part.  The sound quality though is more impressive with an excellent job done in this DTS-HD MA transfer which ranks among the best I've ever heard and comes closer to reference quality for Blu-ray.

As this is a stripped-down version the special features aren't that special with just trailers, a music-only track and a commentary the only items on offer here.  Still for me personally I am satisfied with the film in a lower-cost version without the frills.

Good picture quality, great sound quality and a great epic movie makes this an easy review.

BEN HUR IS VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE WAYS OF THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT THAT WERE OCCUPYING JERUSALEM AT THAT TIME AND THE WAY THEY LOOKED AT THINGS. VERY INTERESTING INDEED. ITS A LOVE STORY, AND FOR BEN HUR AND HIS FAMILY IT WAS A LESSON IN LEARNING TO FORGIVE, WHICH SURE DIDN'T COME EASY IN HIS CASE. SOME OF US HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT AS WELL.

1336578,3,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is one of those sword and sandal epics that, like The Ten Commandments or Spartacus, is a good film, well acted, well directed, but ultimately, is just a good excuse to eat junk food, for there's nothing of any real depth to it. In many ways, it is sort of Part Two of Charlton Heston's three part `religious epic', which started with The Ten Commandments and ended with El Cid (a bit better of a film than the two others).  The difference is that this is the least religious of the trio, despite its subtitle being A Story Of The Christ.

  The film has a few standout scenes, excluding the justly famed chariot sequence (which includes the accidental flip of Hur over the chariot- done by a stuntman, of course), including the two exchanges of water between Christ and Hur, and the dialogue between Hur and Arrius, before their connection is formed, wherein both men counter-taunt each other with words; Heston seeming to make a career over ironic taunts, which would reach its apogee in The Planet Of The Apes. But, mostly, Ben-Hur is good old fashioned moviemaking; an epic that has few weaknesses and a number of strengths, even if it is barren of anything of depth. Believe me, there are many worse ways to spend an afternoon than watching Charlton Heston kick ass on the past.",1340236800,,1291,4.6244541484716155

1336597,4,B00003OSTA,"Film crafts run amok! Every movie lover should see William Wyler's 1959 version of ""Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ"" at least once in their lives--for the chariot race, the sea battle, the sets, the costumes, the crowd scenes . . . it is probably THE crowing achievement of pre-CGI Technicolor spectacle. Watch the special ""making of"" feature on the DVD and you will be even more impressed. According to the Wikipedia article about the production, not one horse was injured filming the chariot race--even more reason to applaud the team that made ""Ben-Hur.""

When one sets the spectacle aside, however, Ben-Hur suffers from excessive length, uneven writing, and even more uneven acting. Stephen Boyd as Massala, Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius, and Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim give lively performances. Haya Harareet is OK as Ben-Hur's love interest Esther. Unfortunately Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's mother and sister are limp as wet towels. Charlton Heston lights up the screen as Ben-Hur in the chariot race. He spent weeks learning to drive a chariot for the role, and clearly loves and respects his equine teammates. Strangely he seems more at ease and authentic in this most dangerous of sequences than at any other time. Although well-possessed of star quality that demands attention, Heston acts most of his scenes like a man trying to be brave while undergoing a root canal without anesthesia.  At 214 minutes of running time, the audience spends a lot of time watching talky or repetitive scenes at the dentist's office starring Mr. Heston.

As far as this being ""A Tale of the Christ,"" this ""Ben-Hur"" offers ""Jesus Light,"" which may or may not be to your liking. Jesus gives Ben-Hur water when he is near dying of thirst, and we hear a bit of talk of Jesus's message and miracles. The meat of the movie, though, is Ben-Hur's quest for revenge against his former childhood friend Massala, and he does not suffer particularly for taking vengeance into his own hands. While Ben-Hur is grateful to Jesus, the audience never sees Jesus transform Ben-Hur's soul. Instead, the traditional nativity scene at the beginning and the Sermon on the Mount and crucifixion scenes at the end feel like they wandered in from another movie to bookend ""Ben-Hur"" in an historical time frame.

I saw a one-disk two-sided edition rented from my local video store. The color, sound and 70-mm picture were far better than I dared to expect. If you are on a budget and considering a purchase of ""Ben-Hur,"" this would probably be a better choice than a multi-disk boxed set package.

- At times there is a softness of focus on a few scenes here and there, and then it clears up to stunning sharpness again. This is no doubt due in large part of the quality of the stock remaining for some scenes. It wouldn't be noticeable if the other scenes were not rendered so damn perfect!

But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple: Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a ""real time"" you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.

But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too: achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.",1334880000,,2783,4.489151873767258

1336645,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is an old story. It was written by the Union General, Lew Wallace, in 1880 and has never been out of print since that time. Unlike the Heston movie, the book dwells less on the flashy parts of the story--sea battle and chariot race--and more on Christ and his effects on those around him. Wallace must have been a deeply religious man, and it shows through his story. The book also gives a better portrayal of Ben-Hur as a young man, who first seeks understanding, when older revenge, and finally as a mature man, he achieves redemption and peace. A great read--read the kindle edition--in every way and highly recommended.",1334534400,,631,4.693693693693693

I couldn't have been happier when it came out on tape & I could see it uncut for TV again--even though it was a cumbersome 2 tape deal.  Now, this 50th anniversary DVD version fills my heart with nostalgia & great happiness.  The 2 books add a depth to the story of the making off the movie that was enjoyable as well as informative.  The extra discs provide insight as well as entertainment.  It was even interesting viewing the silent version made back in the 1920's.  It is reassuring that this 50+ year old movie still means enough to the industry that they would issue this commemorative edition.  I was surprised to see it was numbered as part of a limited edition.",1334448000,,807,4.298013245033113

1336662,5,B00003OSTA,"There has been a long-standing misconception that ""old"" movies can't benefit from a high definition transfer. Well, it was wrong before, and it's still wrong now. But pop this Blu-Ray disc in your player, and no one will ever suspect it is true again.

Ben-Hur is presented in a two-disc edition that basically includes just the movie and commentary, split across two discs. This is a nice alternative to paying forty plus for an edition that includes all kinds of ""collectors"" junk and a giant box that won't fit on your shelf anyway. The movie is of course a classic, and I find it to be pretty absorbing and entertaining. Heston gives some of his most nuanced work, and the supporting cast is all good.

As far as the quality of the transfer itself, it has many high points:
-Very strong detail across the entire range, large and small, near and far. Faces show tiny beads of sweat, cloth shows realistic texture, foliage and stones pop with realism.
-Very light film grain is evident, whereas no DNR or EE is evident.
-Very strong colors, especially the reds of the Roman uniforms. Flesh tones are pleasingly realistic.
-Good dimensionality in bright shots, less so in dark shots.
-Excellent and solid black levels, with a good amount of detail near black.
-Very few shots besides process shots show some degradation of the film elements. I counted two dropped frames, and about ten seconds worth of print damage manifesting itself in some wavering colors.

Basically, in every way except special effects and lighting choices (that is, many interior shots are realistically lit, and thus look somewhat dark to an eye trained by the likes of Michael Bay), this transfer is competitive with any on the market today, and stands as probably the single best 65mm transfer available. It is WAY better than the unfortunate botched transfer job on ""Spartacus,"" and it is a terrific companion piece to ""The Ten Commandments,"" also on Blu-Ray. Between these two classic epics, there should no longer be any doubt that classic films can look superb in HD. Any film fan should buy this right away, especially at this reduced price!

By the way, if you are interested in getting the third disc from the bigger set, I suggest importing from Amazon.co.uk. There is a 3-disc edition with none of the superfluous stuff from the box. It will cost you more than the 2 disc set, but still much less than the big box. The Blu-Ray itself is region free, so it will play in any American player. Don't ask me why WB insists on giving the US market an all-or-nothing choice.",1333324800,,2553,4.743243243243243
1336663,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is a cinematic classic with the chariot race scene being one of the most indelible and iconic scenes in movie history.  Although I enjoy the film, I wasn't ready to drop the coin for the collector's edition with the extra stuff I don't need or want or over $30. for the dvd/blu-ray combo since I already owned the dvd.  When I saw the $9.99 blu-ray movie only edition, I pounced on it.  The transfer is superb and adds a new spark and life to the film.

1336665,5,B00003OSTA,"Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

I am reviewing the UK version of this:  Ben-Hur - Ultimate Collector's Edition [1959] [Blu-ray][Region Free] (3-disc set).

The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I give it a 9.98 on a 10.0 scale.  It looks perfect, except for some very, very fine grain that is barely noticeable in some scenes (mostly the sky).  I sit about 7 feet away from a 52"" LCD, and I could hardly even see it.  You can pretty much say that there is no grain in this Blu-Ray movie.  Colors are fantastic.  Sometimes faces seemed a little soft.  But I am being very picky with these criticisms.  Blacks are black, without grain, and without any distortion.  This is the best video quality I've ever seen in an older movie, and I cannot remember any newer movie looking better.

Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is adequate at most times, very good during a few instances.  Mostly there is no surround sound, but when you hear it, it is subtle.  Except at the end, when surround sound is strong.  There could have been more surround sound during the chariot race.

Aspect ratio is wider than the usual 2.35:1.  I think it is listed as 2.76:1, but it looked more like 2.5:1 to me.

This is a very long movie, on two discs.  The movie lasts 2 hours and 22 minutes on the first disc, and an hour and 20 minutes on the second disc, for a total of 222 minutes (3 hours and 42 minutes).  The first disc ends with an intermission.  At the beginning there is an Overture that last for several minutes.  There are no credits at the end.

I did not look at the special features on the third disc.",1333152000,,1689,4.388349514563107
1336666,5,B00003OSTA,"The Ultimate collector is a great pack for the film. Include:

- The BR film with a awensome disc of special features.
- A copy of the Charlton Henston,s diary.
- A book of pictures of the film.",1333152000,,194,4.105263157894737
1336667,5,B00003OSTA,The blu-ray transfer is phenomenal!  The movie is more majestic than when I saw it in 1959!  The chariot race is the climax it's meant to be!  And if you have a long memory and still think the silent race is the one to beat it's included here in a complete copy of the original Silent Film.  You couldn't ask for more when it comes to Ben Hur and the painstaking frame by frame restoration will take your breath away.  Too bad we don't have the really big screens in home yet...because this movie cries out for it!!!  The story is covered by many reviewers and the transfer in technical aspects is too...all I can tell you is you'll see why Charlton Heston (in this and The Ten Commandments) became an indelible screen presence for several generations til his death.  The movie is grand scale in every aspect.  It's as if William Wyler were throwing down the Gauntlet to Cecil B. Demille and saying...you're not the only Epic maker around you know!  And then it garnered 11 Oscars.  DeMille must have been spewing every biblical ephitat short of cursing he could muster (and face it...it was Hollywood...he probably cursed too!)!  This is one of if not 'the' finest example of Hollywood studio Epic Motion Picture making (which were designed to get those bottoms off the couch in front of the TV and back in the Theaters by virtue of offering a grand screen spectacle they couldn't get on that little box in the living room - sound familiar?).  Great Story.  Great Stars. Great Cinematography!  And family friendly.  Find that today.  I'd give it 11 stars if I could. ( I should have mentioned the hours of extras and the hardcover collector's book with behind the scenes photos...and the real prize...an exact duplication of Charlton Heston's own diary of the proceedings while making this masterpiece...they make the collector's edition a REAL collector's edition!),1333065600,,1867,4.751552795031056

1336680,5,B00003OSTA,"This is nothing short of a spectacular deal:  with the images newly crisp, beautiful sound, and plenty of extras, I think this is the best bluray that I have ever purchased.

I have nothing to add about the quality of the film's theme and plot.  You identify with Ben-Hur as he goes through an extraordinary journey, both physical and spiritual; it is so emotionally real that I must struggle to keep from weeping every single time I see it.  There is action, big ideas, and psychological and spiritual growth.  No other film does this for me - I am an atheist, or a non-believing christian, if you will.

SO far as the film print version goes, I think it is the best available.  The transfer is better than all previous versions.  The extras are fun, in particular the complete 1925 silent version that has many basic differences from the 1959 version, e.g. Simonides, Ben-Hur's loyal slave, is afraid to recognize him in the earlier version, as it will enslave his daughter Esther.  While I tire of the self-congratulatory documentaries, which are softball papp of the genre, ""oh, everyone was so wonderful and talented"", but there is interesting info in them as well.

Warmly recommended.  Interestingly, I got the British version, which was the equivalent of $15. (With 3 disks, I am not certain that this one has all the things that the American version does, but it has commentaries, music only tracks, outtakes, etc.  The essential, of course, is the film.  It is region 2, I believe.)",1333065600,,1492,4.7587548638132295
1336681,5,B00003OSTA,This amazing film has been restored and looks amazing!! I highly recommend the blu ray! The picture quality is great without destorting the original look/feel of the film.,1332979200,,171,5.142857142857143
1336682,5,B00003OSTA,"Unfortunately, I never got to see ""Ben-Hur"" in its initial release although as a child I was smitten with the film advertising in the Columbus Dispatch. The film played there at the Hunt's CineStage. It wasn't until 1974 that I finally saw the film -- at Hartford's Wadsworth Antheneum as part of a film series -- in 16MM! Jumping forward, I was fortunate to see a 70MM re-release print at Denver's now defunct Cooper (Cinerama) Theater -- where the image bled beyond the edge of the screen left and right! And the BIG screen is THE way to see this film! It is an enveloping cinematic experience and set the standard for the EPIC movie experience!

To me, ""Ben-Hur"" has always been a powerful film -- anchored with a taunt story which allows the characters to develop and grow. All the powers of film-making were used to the fullest here to engage the viewer and provide a unique experience unparalleled in motion picture history. The film garnered a plethora of rewards and earned them all!

""Ben-Hur"" has now been released in Blu-ray and the result is remarkable -- all the reviews you have read here on Amazon regarding the high image and audio quality are true! The technicians who remastered this film are to be commended. This presentation is first class. The image quality is rock solid -- beyond its initial roadshow engagement, I'm certain ""Ben-Hur"" has never looked so good. The rich detail, clarity and color are exceptional. The sound is as clear as you would hope. This looks like it was mastered from a film made yesterday. The image is presented in its original wide aspect ratio and is a sight to behold.

The big box set is a treasure and worth it to me because this is a true film classic and a personal favorite. It contains an informative book about the the making of the film, a reproduction of Heston's diary made during production, the film on two discs and a third disc that has the original B/W silent film and a plethora of special features.

""Ben-Hur"" defines the epic film and this is an epic release. Most highly recommended.",1332806400,,2054,4.634615384615385
1336683,5,B00003OSTA,"There are countless reviews of the movie itself out there so I will not rehash them, but I will just say I think it is an outstanding masterpiece and would recommend you watch it.

I bought the 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray and I am not at all disappointed with what I received. The boxing for the set is unique and well made. You could definitely display it on your movie shelves if you wanted to. The extra materials that are included are listed in the description (so again I won't be redundant) but I will say they were great. The included book with pictures and cast bios makes a great coffee table book if you wanted to do that since it's not too detailed, but gives enough interesting information that I'm sure a lot of people would like to browse it. Heston's personal journal from when he worked on the film is great! This was not a ""look back"", but is the text from his actual journal that he wrote in almost every day during the filming of the movie. Seeing his personal thoughts and hearing some candid behind the scenes info was really interesting. At the point of writing this review I have not watched all the bonus footage on the 2nd disc so I will not comment on that for now but will update this once I do.

Bottom line, if you are not a big Ben Hur fan you probably should steer towards a regular edition since the extra money will probably not be worth it to you, but if you love Ben Hur I think all the extras in this Collector's Edition will be worth it to you.",1332806400,,1507,4.302816901408451

I had heard about the chariot scene. That's not the kind of thing that usually interests me, but it was amazing! I wouldn't have missed it.

The film is something that can be enjoyed and appreciated by those of all faiths.

When you first start the DVD, the OVERTURE comes on. It goes on FOREVER!  I could have started and finished a book while waiting, but I hit the fast-forward over and over again until I got to the start of the movie.

Blu ray transfer is excellent. Picture and sound quality could not have been possibly better. They really did a great job with restoring this masterpiece. This movie is a must-have for all fans. It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1959. The final chariot race scene is amazing even in today's standard. Film making at its best.

1336711,3,B00003OSTA,"This movie is at the same time one of the greatest and one of the most disappointing of all time. The story line couldn't be better, the foresight of the producers couldn't be worse. This movie can only be enjoyed in a theater with a special screen designed for that aspect ratio. This is how I saw it in 1959 in Hollywood. In 1959 there was huge fear with the hollywood  ""mucky-mucks"" that nobody would go to theaters because of TV. So instead of all getting together and planning a different aspect ratio other than TV's 4:3, which was adopted because of all the old movies it could purchase, Hollywood producers went on an ""ego-trip"" and developed a numerous amount of different aspect ratios to identify their work from other producers. This is how ""black bars"" on your TV screen were born. Ben-Hur is among the worst. The total amount of picture on a 16:9 TV,that all of us have, is less than 50%. In the 20's hollywood moguls,owners of studios like Louie B Mayer and others, got together an decided to have ""one"" aspect ratio in part so that the theaters at the time could show everybody's movies from everybody's studios. If the same thing was done in the 50's that way we would all be better off now. I have a LG Blu-Ray player which allows me to get rid of the black bars but at a sacrifice. I lose 30% of the picture on both sides. When the Chariot scene comes on I switch back to normal. The rest of the movie can be watched without bars reasonably well. I have 3 Blu-ray players from 3 different companies but only the LG can do this.",1330300800,,1546,4.368055555555555

I think that The Personal Journal of Charlton Heston is the synthesis of a master, the words of one of the best actors in the history and one of the best materials I've seen. Is amazing how this book or diary is given to the owner.

Why almost a perfect score?, well, I live in Mexico and is so sad that a huge item like this DOES NOT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL AUDIO FEATURE IN LATINO SPANISH. Once again, Amazon should specify that the dubbing in ""spanish"" is spanish from Spain, and this absolutely ruins the film if the viewer picks this language to watch the movie. However, the original audio in english is amazing, and that's the way to watch a movie, in its original language. That's why I think this item deserves almost a perfect score.

The Production Book is fantastic - filled with photos, press releases and newspaper articles from the time. Now, in order to get access to the Blu-ray/DVDs and the Diary, a ribbon lies across the Production book which you lift so you don't damage the book.

I then had to explain over and over again what I sent back and how I have not gotten any reply (english would be good for customer service), it seemed to just disappear.

It's been several years since I've read the novel, so I can't comment on what has been cut, if anything, but I do remember that Messala's final reckoning is expanded in the novel. I have no criticisms of this audio drama whatsoever. Only that it would have been nice if Charlton Heston had played Ben-Hur here as well, though the actor they chose was a good one.

I have been a customer at Amazon since it first opened.  I see a slippage in their pricing lately on a lot of items.  I live in California, they will soon be charging sales tax.

1336774,4,B00003OSTA,"There is something to be said about true studio epics.  Something about seeing literally 1000s of people in one shot is so much more exciting than watching modern CGI.  Charlton Heston plays the title role of Judah Ben-Hur and works in his own little Charlton Heston way that no one can really emulate.  The plot is fairly fantastic, and overall feels somewhat ridiculous, but works well as a staging device for the huge scale chariot races and battles.  Towards the end of the film, it takes a dramatic shift in tone to focus on the death of Jesus Christ, which after the first 2 and a half hours of a revenge plot is about a jarring shift in tone that one can find.  The cinematography makes the film feel huge, and really gives the feel of an epic adventure.  The score is wonderful, adding the punctuation to amazing scenes.  One of my biggest complaints is that Ben-Hur's sister and mother feel out of place, because the film in the final act is all about them, who have largely been absent for the first 2 hours.  The studio epic was a way for the studios to win back audiences from television, and consequently they threw a lot of money at films that were simply large.  Ben-Hur is a great example of this, and the film stands well enough on its own merits.  Overall a very fun film to watch and it nails the aspect of scale perfectly.",1322956800,,1342,4.41869918699187

a new film, especially all the outside scenes.  It is in a wide 2.76 ratio, so the bars on the top and bottom are a bit pronounced,
but it looks so much better than my old dvd.

They spread this movie over 2 discs for each version, the bluray and dvd version.  So it includes FOUR discs total.  Extras include Commentary
by Charlton Heston and film historian T Gene Hatcher.  Also music only soundtrack and trailers.  It doesn't include the book etc of the ultimate edition,

1336789,5,B00003OSTA,"If I told you what I paid for the deluxe set (with a collectible Roman-soldier figurine, yet!) on Black Friday at a famous consumer-electronics store -- you'd plotz.

This HD transfer is far superior to any I've seen. It's supposedly from the camera negative, and the extreme sharpnss and detail support this. There is no apparent grain reduction, as you can see huge amounts of grain in areas of blue sky (a surprising amount for a film shot in 65mm).

The best thing, though, is that the flat, vulgar color of earlier editions is gone. Though no one would mistake ""Ben-Hur"" for a ""modern"" film, one can finally appreciate the really beautiful cinematography, especially in the darker scenes shot on studio sets.

I get the feeling we're /finally/ seeing the sea battle correctly. In particular, it's much darker than previous versions, consistent with the cloudy skies of the backdrop. (Much of it was shot in a tank, if it's not obvious. Arnold Gillespie's miniatures hold up very well, even after 50 years.)

I used to consider Charlton Heston's totally-unjustified-for-an-Oscar-nomination performance as wooden or stilted. Looking at it for perhaps the seventh time, I realize that the problem is that Heston had difficulty modulating his delivery. If he's happy, he's very happy. If angry, very angry. And no one will ever convince me that his clench-jawed butchering of ""I see no enemy"" in any way reflects how Judah truly felt at that moment.

As in ""Spartacus"", the British actors generally deliver better performances than the Americans. Hugh Griffith, in particular, gets a plum role as sheik Ilderan, the ""goofy Arab"" version of the ""crazy Mexican"" Eli Wallach perfected. Griffith is so heavily painted down that it looks as if the makeup department went through a whole case of Kiwi mahogany.

The supplemental material is pretty good. A hard-back book appears to duplicate the written contents of the roadshow souvenir book, and adds additional photos and press releases. Another, smaller, hardback includes about 100 pages from the journal Heston kept during the production.

The most-interesting supplement is a 75-minute film about Heston and ""Ben-Hur"". It's almost a hagiography, but Heston convincingly comes across as a kind, modest person who put his family first and was generous to and well-liked by almost all who met him. (This is consistent with the impression I got when Sandy Gross interviewed him a few years ago.) Would that he had been as good an actor as he was a human being.

Strongly recommended, if you can tolerate Heston's unsubtle performance. I do have to wonder, though, why, given the things that can be done with digital transfers, his eye color wasn't changed to brown.

PS: Just to set the record straight... Miklos Rozsa's ""best-ever"" score is rarely more than cornball tripe. In particular, the passage where the Star of Bethlehem moves over the manger (switching from widebeam to spotlight) is the musical equivalent of a Thomas Kinkade painting.",1322265600,,2994,5.069105691056911

1336824,5,B00003OSTA,"Based on ""Ben Hur, A Tale of the Christ"" by Civil War General Lew Wallace, this film won an unprecedented 11 Academy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Actor (Charlton Heston), Director, and Cinematography. The biggest of the religious epics of the 1950s, Ben Hur was also one of the most carefully crafted and by far the most successful. Now, 52 years later, it still has the power to affect the mind and the heart, with a powerful story lavishly painted on a widescreen canvas.

Charlton Heston is Ben Hur, a high-born Jew in Roman occupied Palestine. His boyhood friendship with a Roman who grew to be an officer in the Imperial Army (Stephen Boyd) avails him naught when a Roman officer is injured by a tile falling from Ben Hur's house. He is arrested and sentenced to life in the war galleys, essentially a sentence of death. His mother and sister are imprisoned, eventually contracting leprosy and banished to a leper colony.

From this nadir of despair Ben Hur rises by good fortune and the strength of his hunger for revenge, a revenge that he achieves in the epic chariot race. Twice his path crosses that of a carpenter from Nazareth, first with a gift of water on Ben Hur's forced march into slavery, then with a gift of life and a cessation of the burning hatred that had been in his heart, a hatred extinguished by Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

In 1958, Heston appeared in William Wyler's epic of Texas, The Big Country. It was a secondary role to that of Gregory Peck, and Heston took it because his agent said the experience working with Wyler, one of Hollywood's leading directors, would be beneficial. The very next year, Wyler chose Heston to play the lead in Ben Hur.

Movies don't come bigger, more lavishly produced, or more successful than Ben Hur. Clocking in at over 3 hours long, it is an overwhelming experience. Although the high-definition Blu-ray was billed as a 50th anniversary edition, the extensive restoration of the film delayed its release until 2 years after the actual anniversary. The wait was worth it. The film has been flawlessly restored, including a powerful rendition of Miklos Rosa's Academy Award winning score.",1320019200,,2168,4.773333333333333

EXCLUSIVE BOOK WITH RARE PHOTOS, PRODUCTION ART AND REPRODUCTIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL PRESSBOOK

BLU-RAY: is codefree and contains a german soundtrack (HURRAY!!!).
Another plus why I prefer this Set and not the German-Release: it contains the 1925 Ben-Hur Version, which isn't on the german Blu-Ray.

The only minus point I have: audio-commentary isn't subtitled like on the ""Star Wars""-Blu-Ray Release.

The Picture Quality: AMAZING, INCREDIBLE SHARP. We can see now details I have never seen really. All those details on the costumes, probs, Set-Buildings. And its amazing how perfect the special effects (Matte Paintings) are made in 1958/59.

FAZIT: its a must have.

I haven't even looked at Fraser's documentary yet but I'm sure it will be just great.  Thank you so much to Lydia, Fraser, and Holly for sharing this with all of us.  God bless you all.  This is a must for any Charlton Heston fan!",1318032000,,538,4.474226804123711
1336874,4,B00003OSTA,"This is my father's favorite film of all time.  As a child I think I watched this at least twice a year, and so I've seen it roughly twenty times, that I can remember.  As an adult, living on my own, I've watched it twice, once a few years ago and once recently (within the past month).  This film is, without a doubt, the definition of epic.  It can be categorized alongside `Gone With the Wind' as one of the most expansive and detailed pieces in cinematic history, and it is regarded with almost the same amount of admiration and respect by the general public as well as the critical masses.  `Ben-Hur' is a film that is considered a masterpiece.  It won eleven Academy Awards, a feat that has only been matched twice since (with `Titanic' and `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King').

This film is very good.

The story told is one that is quite engaging.  Judah Ben-Hur, a respected Jewish man who is betrayed by his friend, the Roman Messala.  He is sold into slavery while his family is imprisoned and persecuted.  Ben-Hur spends the remainder of the film seeking revenge.  His journey is wondrous and, well, epic.  From grand battles at sea to savagely intense chariot races, `Ben-Hur' never holds back.  It runs at four hours in length and yet it fills those hours with engaging and commanding atmosphere and situations that grab us and won't let us go.

For what it's worth, `Ben-Hur' deserves the praise it receives.

So while I won't debate the fact that it is a cinematic gem and a proven masterpiece (it has stood the test of time very well and still can exact awe from new viewers), I must say that there is something about this film that rubs me wrong.  That `something' is Charlton Heston.  Some actors you get, others you don't.  I was never really fond of Heston to be honest.  The performances I've seen of his never really seem fulfilled.  Ben-Hur is such a complex character, one that encapsulates everything `human' about being `human'.  The stagnant delivery of Heston's performance is a severe detriment to the film.  I've said this before (not here, but to friends); Heston is about as effective in this role as a 2x4.  The point being that he's wooden, stiff, emotionless.  When he does emote, it feels forced and unnatural.  He really needed to BLEED THIS CHARACTER, but his acting style does not fit this character at all.  This needed someone who can act with a more vulnerable soul.  Instead, everyone remembers Heston's physical presence here, but Ben-Hur the man is far more than a physical spectacle.  I may get flack for this, but the comparison is semi-obvious.  Look at 2000's `Gladiator'.  The storylines are vaguely similar, but that's not what I'm getting at.  Look at the lead performances.  Look at the way that Russell Crowe BREATHES that man.  Sure, he is a physical marvel (I mean, LOOK AT HIM) but that isn't the first thing you think of when you remember that performance.  You think of his face, the way the pain of his loss corrodes his features and the way the sharp bursts of vengeance seethe from his lips.  You see the man from every emotional angle.

Heston doesn't do that.

Alas, Heston aside, this film is remarkable (and, to be honest, even with Heston's wooden performance the film is a spectacle to behold).  The set pieces are beautifully designed, the direction is flawless (those action sequences, while wildly outdated, are still effectively conveyed) and Stephen Boyd delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of all time (why wasn't HE the actor nominated for the Oscar?  I mean, he won the Golden Globe and the Oscar had to mess things up and give the Oscar to Hugh Griffith, who was good here but nowhere near Boyd).  The way that Boyd builds so much internalized loathing in Messala is outstanding.  The script is moving, fluid and meticulously detailed.  Sure, I think that the biblical overtones and the whole `Jesus' ending was a bit much and didn't really pertain to the identity of this film (yes, it's a detail that adds a layer to the film, but I don't think it was a necessary layer).  Still, the script is very impressive.

I know that some will balk at my four star rating and my harsh criticism of Heston, but I'm always honest to my opinion.  Four stars is still a really good grade though.  I mean, it's epic, that's for sure, so I highly recommend seeing this.

`Some Like It Hot' should have won the Oscar though!",1317945600,,4412,4.625

1336876,5,B00003OSTA,"This is the Blu-ray we have been waiting for.  For sight & sound, BEN HUR is simply magnificent.  Much has been written about the film during these past 50 years and, yet, it holds up quite well. Yes, there are some script and visual shortcomings (obvious indoor sets, miniatures and matte paintings) but they are far outweighed by director William Wyler's forward-moving focus and MGM's typically superb production and post production.  Seen on a large plasma, the 65mm transfer to blu-ray is topnotch with thunderous multi-channel sound to match -- the chariot race alone is worth the price of this set -- and a close second is Rozsa's rousing score spectacularly played and recorded by the seldom recognized MGM studio orchestra. Kudos to all for this fine release.",1317600000,,768,4.984375
1336877,5,B00003OSTA,"I just got my copy of the BluRay version of BEN-HUR.  This version is absolutely fantastic or any other adjective that you want to use to describe it.

I was 14 years old when this movie was originally released in 1959.  In the ensuing 52 years I have watched this movie in excess of 600 times.  It would be a gross misunderstatement to say that this is my ""favorite movie"" of all time.  I have had versions in Betamax, VHS, DVD and now in BluRay.  BluRay is by far the best version of the movie released to date.  I don't see how they can do a better job but with technology being the way it is I'm sure that a much better version will be available in the years to come.  The question is will I be around to see it?

I lived in the Boston area about 20 years ago.  The Wang Center was created about that time period.  The Wang Center contained, I believe, it was a 20 screen, state-of-the-art theatre complex.  To introduce the cinema to the people they had a contest and the top 20 films would be shown in the opening weeks.  BEN-HUR was one of them.  They got a remastered version of it and Charlton Heston appeared on the stage to introduce the film.  One hell of a night.  I thought that this version was superior.  Though it's only a fond memory at this time it doesn't compare to the BluRay version that is now available.

I wish that I could recommend the 50th Anniversary set for $44 but I can't.  When the movie soundtrack was released it came in a package that had an information booklet on BEN-HUR.  I was hoping that booklet would be in this presentation set.  It wasn't and I think they made a major mistake in not releasing the booklet.  Get the disc NOT the package.",1317600000,,1682,4.239747634069401
1336888,5,B00003OSTA,"An epic movie from the era of great Hollywood epics, when the Biblical epic was unashamed and unapologetic.  Definitely before political correctness entered the motion picture arena.  Ben-Hur transcends the general Biblical epic insofar as it tells the story of how the lives of the characters were affected through their own interaction with Jesus Christ.  A classic tale written by General Lew Wallace in the 1880's while he dealt with his own personal crisis of faith. His successful search for God is at the heart of this story.  Ben-Hur is the story of a man of nobility who now finds his country under the tryrannical rule of the Roman Empire.  Through a sudden twist of fate, he finds himself on opposite sides with his boyhood friend who has him condembed to a slow death in captivity as a galley slave.  He has filled his heart with vengeance which he one day hopes to exact on his enemy, and this hatred carries him through several improbable paths to find his way back to fulfill his revenge.  Ultimately, he comes into contact with Jesus Christ, and the wonder of forgiveness finds its way into his heart transforming his hate into love.  Truly a wonderful story of transformation of the human spirit.

This Blu-Ray release finally does justice to this magnificent tale, and with today's home entertainment technology, the awesome scope of the theatrical release is regained to the home viewer.  This film was made for Blu-Ray technology, and it does the film justice.  This set is filled with marvelous special features, including telling the story of the making of Ben-Hur and interviews with contemporary flim makers talking about how this movie influenced their own talents.  It is amazing to think that this was created in 1958-1959, when the film-makers did not have CGI and other SFX techiques to rely on. They had to construct massive sets filled with many extras, and rely on talented stunt men to create the action you see on screen.  Then finally, to rely on the talent of the actors to tell the story among this grandiose backdrop.  Also, there is the personal story of Charlton Heston as told by his son and daughter, and his wife.  Mr. Heston was a giant of the screen industry and a terrific person.  He brings such an emotion to this role, that the character comes to life before you.  I remember seeing this movie as a child of 6 in its initial release, in reserved seating engagements.  From that point on, Charlton Heston was always bigger than life to me.

Having said all of this, let me highly recommend this Blu-Ray edition of Ben-Hur, it is well worth the modest price. It will bring much enjoyment to the whole family.",1317513600,,2655,4.745098039215686

1336891,5,B00003OSTA,"I am reviewing the September 2011 Blu-Ray edition of Ben-Hur.

In a word, it is spectacular!  Initially scheduled to come out two years ago on its 50th anniversary of the original theatrical release, it was delayed so that the high-definition on this old-school film could be achieved properly.  Trust me --- it was worth the wait.  The video is magnificent.  Details are clearly visible.  The HD has added the perception of depth to this two-dimensional feature.  I was amazed by the detail, such as the leaves of the trees blowing in the breeze.  Those who watch this primarily for the chariot race are not likely to be disappointed either. The rich color and depth add life to this film which has always been fun to watch but often showed its age.  The sea battle scenes, which I always thought looked fake on the smaller screens of television, look so much more realistic in this edition.  I cannot say enough about the high-definition video.

The audio is also fantastic.  I could not detect a single audio artifact in the entire soundtrack.  The digitized recording is clear and free of hum and hiss.  Rozsa's score is amazing and so much more enjoyable in this remastered format.

I was reluctant (because of the extra cost) to purchase the Ultimate Collector's Edition.  I debated both before I went to the store and at the store whether I should buy this edition or the basic Blu-Ray.  I am more than happy with my purchase of the Collector's Edition.  It comes with a 64-page Production Art book and a 128-page reproduction of Charlton Heston's personal diary of the film.  And, of course, there are quite a few video features (including the 1925 silent version) on Disc 3 of the Blu-Ray set, most of which I have yet to watch.

There are two things that bothered me.  The one major thing that disappointed me was that the face of Jesus in the scene before Pilate was deliberately blacked out.  I think the intention was to make it look like a shadow.  Instead it looks like someone went into  Microsoft Paint and used an airbrush to black out his face.  For a very brief second, you can see his face when he begins to bend down to pick up his cross.  I imagine that the actor who portrayed Jesus had something in his contract about his face not being seen, or maybe it was a personal preference of William Wyler's.  With the higher definition now available with Blu-Ray and on the bigger high-definition TV screens, the face of Jesus would have certainly been clearer in this format.  Personally, I wish they would have left it alone and allowed his face to be shown for that one brief scene.  The ""shadow"" looks ugly.

The other thing that bothered me is more minor but noticable.  Perhaps the problem exists in previous versions and I just never noticed it.  In the scene where the slaves are being marched through Nazareth and Jesus gives Ben-Hur water, if you watch towards the end of that scene, you will notice that the audio sync is off.  When the Roman shouts something along the lines of ""Back to your places!"" the audio is clearly out of sync with the Roman soldier's lips.

Other than those two things, I am amazed by this Blu-Ray edition of ""Ben-Hur"" and will watch it again in the very near future.  It is a beautiful upgrade from DVD and I agree whole-heartedly with Blu-Ray.com's assessment that Ben-Hur is the gold standard of what can be accomplished with high-definition Blu-Ray.",1317427200,,3408,4.632721202003339
1336892,5,B00003OSTA,"This is one of those movies where you don't have to be religious to enjoy a story with religious intentions.

Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Moses.  Every good story has a great hero, so why not Ben-Hur?

And, of course, every good story has a common enemy.  Nazis, Al-Qaeda, The Riddler, and even Darth Vader.  So here, Ben-Hur had to compete with the sinister Roman named Masala, to protect his God fearing people, and to even prove his innocence of a misfortunate event that evidently lead to persecute himself and his mother and sister.

But, I couldn't believe how expensive this Blu-ray release was for Ben-Hur this time around.  And now that I've received it from Amazon, I'm rather overwhelmed by the packaging of the film.  This box is a shelf-consuming Monstrosity!

This big-a$$ box has three discs, one of which is full of special features that I'd probably only watch once. Plus it comes with two books.  Who needs these stupid books?  I scanned through one of them and found that it's just a bunch of written breakdowns of the days of filming.  How freakin' boring!  And, this whole big box weighs about 6 pounds and I don't know where to put it in my Blu-Ray collection.  It's a huge eye-sore!  I hope they'll release this movie as ONLY the movie at a much reduced price, and that it fits in with my other BD discs.  Or, if I just keep this huge box, I can just use it as a door stop, or a support block to hold my window open, or if I stand it upside, this could be used as an extra seat at the dinner table when I have company.

What a bunch of unnecessary info-stock fodder that I got stuck with, that I had to pay for, when all I wanted was just the movie itself in Blu-ray.  I'm surprised that this box didn't also include an imitation leather whip with Masala's name on it, which I'm sure some hardcore movie collector would cherish and hang on their wall above their TV set, or just keep it in its original wrapper and keep the whole box set honorably intact, and displayed on some mantle.

Now, I'm hearing from people that this movie is available as a single disc version at Best Buy.  So, I guess I ordered this movie too soon from Amazon.

I took delivery of the new Blu Ray version yesterday, and had to immediately project sample segments onto a giant screen.  My reaction to what I saw is that I believe it is unlikely that this movie can ever be expected to look better than this in any home edition.  The clarity, the vibrance of the color, the apparent flawlessness of every frame, and the amazing sound quality are indescribably gratifying.  As always, I do NOT recommend this movie for small screen viewing.

Now I will get down to the specifics of this Blu-ray edition:

Outer Box:
About the same size as Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind collections.  You slide the slipcover off to reveal a GORGEOUS black box with the title in bronzed bas relief on the top.  This is not a flip up case like Wiz and Gone, but a box with a removable lid.  The artwork of the title is truly beautiful.  It looks like bronze with the statues from the arena of the big chariot race bookending the title BEN HUR.  You immediately get the feeling that what you're holding in your hands is something of high quality.

Inside the Box:
Lift the lid off the box and you see the hardcover book with a black ribbon underneath to help lift it out of the box.  The book also has the title in bronzed raised text with a wonderful picture of Heston in the iconic chariot race.  The book itself is filled with gorgeous quality images where the colors just pop off the page.  The gold background on some of the pages adds a touch of class to this book.

The Discs:
The three Blu-ray discs are housed in a very study try-fold disc holder that is very similar to that used in the recent Taxi Driver Blu-ray.  Each disc is very sparse in its presentation.  The background of the try-fold is a color image of Heston in the chariot race.  The discs themselves are very classy with solid black and the text on the discs in a dusty gold.  Nothing flashy here, which adds to the ambience of class that oozes from this set.  What's on the discs is just breathtaking.  Warner Bros. has outdone themselves with the restoration of Ben Hur on Blu-ray.  The image is so crisp and clear that I noticed things in the far distance of some scenes that I had never noticed before.  e.g.) In the opening of the film when we see a Roman garrison walking across the landscape, I now notice a tiny line of red capes in the far distance moving.  I have never seen them before, because I never saw the red robes that are easy to spot now.  While Blu-ray could easily hold the full content of this epic on one disc, it was a wise decision to spread it over two discs.  Thus allowing the film to be presented in the most pristine image and sound ever!!  The bonus disc has the original silent version of the film, along with tons of extras.  One of the new extras is a documentary of Heston as he was filming Ben Hur.  This documentary is worth the purchase alone.  The Heston family has allowed the inclusion of family films and pictures, which really present Heston as a truly loving family man.  While the silent version does not seem to have received any major restoration, it is still an upgrade to the image of the previous DVD version.

Heston Journal:
Have you ever bought a collector's edition of a movie and thought, ""Why would they include this in the box???""  There are no cheap chachkis here.  I really wasn't really enthused about this journal, until I actually read it.  First of all the journal is a beautiful reproduction of Heston's personal daily journal as he worked on this film.  It opens with an introduction from his son Fraser, and then you turn the page and see Heston's personal daily journal pages that have been reproduced so that you actually feel like you're looking at the real thing.  The hardcover is designed to look like a stitched leather journal with the bas-relief image of one of the arena statues from the chariot races on the cover.  The name Charlton Heston is stamped in gold at the bottom.  it is really interesting to see what Heston was thinking on a daily basis of filming one of the greatest films of all time.  There are some reproductions of photos, tickets, and other items that are actually taped into the journal to make it seem more realistic.  At the end of the journal, we are presented with some personal photos showing Heston with his family around Rome and the movie set.  The last image of him walking away on the ancient streets of Rome dressed in a suit while holding his sons hand who happens to be dressed in Roman soldier garb is truly touching.  To my surprise, we are also treated to some of Heston's sketches from the movie set.  I had no idea he was such an artist!  Finally, the journal closes with a brief biography of Heston.  This journal is captivating, and engaging to read.  What a wonderful extra to put in this collection.  No collectible watches, no stacks of cheaply produced post cards, just simple memorabilia of this historic film.

I previously had the 4-disc collector's edition DVD, and I was quite happy with it.  However, seeing the love and attention that Warner Bros. has put into this edition, I can strongly urge you to upgrade to this new Blu-ray edition.  The sound and image is better than you've ever seen before, and the extra items in the box are well worth keeping.  Oh, and did I mention you can get all of this for a fraction of the price you may have paid for previous collector's editions???  This is a no-brainer.......Add it to your cart right now!!",1317081600,,5145,4.424920127795527
1336919,5,B00003OSTA,"""Ben-Hur 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is a lavish Blu-ray packaging of the 1959 Best Picture Academy Award winner.  ""Ben-Hur"" is a Biblical epic that stands far above other movies of the genre, primarily because it doesn't moralize and treat its characters as saints.  The characters are not perfect, not immune to temptation and vengeance, and not one-dimensional.  The film also had the benefit of veteran director William Wyler, balancing the film's action sequences with the personal story of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a member of the family of Judea, who rebels against their state of virtual slavery under Roman rule.

Based on Lew Wallace's best-selling novel, Karl Tunberg's screenplay presented flesh-and-blood characters and plenty of melodrama to keep viewers involved.  Heston, who won the Best Actor Academy Award, dominates the three-and-a-half hour epic as Ben-Hur wins the love of Hebrew maiden Esther (Haya Harareet), is adopted by Roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), and becomes a slave of a sheik (Hugh Griffith) who matches Ben-Hur in a chariot race against his former friend, now enemy -- the cruel and ambitious Roman, Messala (Stephen Boyd).

""Ben-Hur"" required 100,000 costumes, 15,000 extras and a $15 million budget -- the costliest in MGM's history.  The movie was filmed in a process known as MGM Camera 65, one of the widest prints ever made, with a width almost three times its height.  This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots and exciting action sequences.

The chariot race sequence in the Circus Maximus is breathtaking.  It was constructed on over 18 acres of backlot space at Cinecitta Studios outside Rome, and the filming took five weeks.  With the exception of two of the most spectacular stunts, Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did all their own chariot driving in the meticulously choreographed sequence.

""Ben-Hur"" won 11 Academy Awards, a record that held for 38 years until ""Titanic"" won a similar number.  The three-disc Blu-ray box set contains a newly remastered and restored print, the 1925 silent version of ""Ben-Hur,"" screen tests, vintage newsreels, 64-page production art book, replica of Heston's journal and sketches, one-hour making-of featurette, highlights from the 1960 Academy awards ceremony, and the new documentary, ""Charlton Heston & Ben-Hur: A Personal Journey.""",1316822400,,2364,5.408719346049046

1336923,5,B00003OSTA,"What is the greatest story ever told? Well it's not Ben-Hur, but this story does come very close. On the other hand Ben-Hur is arguably the most epic film ever made. This is a tour de force led by Charlton Heston in his prime. If you ever doubted that Heston was one of the greatest, watch this and you will leave the experience convinced of his skills. Also if you disagree with this film's legacy take note that it went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a feat equaled only by Titanic in 1997 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003. This film was directed by William Wyler. Charlton Heston plays Prince Judah Ben-Hur. At no point in this film does it appear as if Heston's character is not 100% convinced that the events taking place are total reality. When watching Ben-Hur the viewer is transported to a different place and time. The dedication, belief, and skill Heston put into the role won him the Academy Award for best actor. Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy merchant that accidentally catches the blame for threatening the life of a Roman general. This does not go over well and he is promptly sentenced to to serve time as galley slave. After a tough run as a slave rower he returns after saving the life of of a Roman commander. Upon his return he is granted freedom and adopted by the commander. He then goes on to be a great charioteer and the rest in cinematic golden history. Coincidentally it is also the history of the world. Ben-Hur has, and will, stand the test of time as a great chapter in the history of film.",1313798400,,1580,4.395904436860068
1336924,5,B00003OSTA,"The book opens with the wise men coming together to search for the newly born Christ.  A few years later, young Judah Ben-Hur lives in Jerusalem with his widowed mother Miriam and his sister Tirzah.  He has been friends with a young Roman named Messala whose father had been stationed in Jerusalem, but now Messala has returned as a Roman soldier in the company of the new Roman governor Gratus and has developed a contempt for all Jews.  While watching a parade, Judah accidentally knocks off a piece of stone that strikes Gratus.  In the, most likely purposefully, mistaken notion that this was an attempt on the life of the governor, Messala has Judah exiled to become a slave in the Roman galley rowing gangs, his mother and sister shut up in a jail cell reserved for lepers, and the estate of his late father seized by the Roman government for Messala's and Gratus's benefit.  While on their way to the sea, the slave gang stops in Nazareth where Judah is given a drink of water by the kindly young son of a carpenter.
  The story line then follows Ben-Hur's time in the galleys, his saving the Roman captain Quintus Arrius following a shipwreck, his adoption by the captain, and his return to Palestine to find his mother and sister.  He seeks the help of his father's old agent, Simonides of Antioch, whose beautiful daughter Esther falls in love with him.  Having become a charioteer in Rome, he finds that Messala is racing in the Antioch games, so he contacts the Arabian sheikh Ilderim, a fellow despiser of Rome, to use his horses in an attempt to get revenge on Messala.  A guest of Ilderim's is Balthasar, one of the wise men, who is now seeking the adult Christ.  Balthasar's daughter Iras also falls in love with Ben-Hur.  Learning of this Messiah from Balthasar and others, Ben-Hur becomes a follower but with the goal of raising an army to help Him drive out the Romans, although he and Balthasar debate the nature of the Christ's coming kingdom.  Will Ben-Hur ever find his mother and sister?  What can be done about their leprosy?  Will he lose his desire for revenge against Messala and Rome?  Will he come to understand the true nature of Christ's kingdom?  And what will they all do when Jesus is crucified?
  Author Lew Wallace was a Civil War general for the North and later federal governor of the New Mexico territory.  He began this book as one who was neither a believer nor a disbeliever in Jesus Christ, but his research for the novel, which resulted from challenges by infidel Robert G. Ingersoll, brought him to faith in God and Christ.  The story was made into an 1899 play and later a 1959 film starring Charlton Heston.  Reportedly, ministers who opposed novels urged their members to read the book, ministers who opposed the theater urged their members to see the play, and ministers who opposed movies urged their members to see the film.  While the plot is somewhat long and complex, as was common in late nineteenth century novels, it is a fascinating tale and the short chapters help make it manageable.  Some have criticized the film for not including the resurrection of Christ but ending only with His death.  The book doesn't record the actual resurrection but definitely refers to it.  In fact, the theme of the book may be found in a statement made about Ben-Hur's realization at the end of chapter 9 of book 8.  ""For when the Nazarene was risen, he understood the death was necessary to faith in the resurrection, without which Christianity would be an empty husk.""  Amen!  There are some references to gambling and drinking wine, undoubtedly accurate in the historical context, and some minor errors (three wise men who visit the stable, and a Jesus with long hair and an effeminate face), but otherwise nothing objectionable.  It took me a while, but I enjoyed reading it.",1313020800,,3822,4.686656671664168

1336944,5,B00003OSTA,"Most reviews on Amazon for this product either are an appraisal of the movie or critique of the price without understanding or appraisal of the product offering. So I would like to make a review that speaks to both. The Film Ben-Hur is not just a classic as in it is an old film good for its time but one of the truly great films of American and world cinema. It is an original blockbuster and a grand theatrical production on a scale never seen and maybe never truly surpassed. As known from just the product description it is tied for the most Academy Awards.
To my informed opinion it is in another category than the films that share the same number of awards. This film won best producer, actor including supporting, director, cinematography,and set designs and film score. In other words in every significant way it was the best film that year in a year of truly great films. It is not just that but that this film represents some of the best work done that is the zenith project of some of the great creative minds in cinematic history. This film was done with great love and fear(for the stakes)making it meticulous and ambitious.
  This is the great of the ""greatest story told"" and the best produced of the Biblical epics in a time when epics were really big. It is not just the themes of revenge,love,redemption that make it""larger than life"" but subtle undertones, and messages of a truly personal story. A film full of understated political and social commentary and carefully subdued but nearly ""mystical"" spirituality. Yes the film is hokey, over the top melodrama but it is Hollywood theater at its best. For those who love the novel the film could have followed the book more closely in ways that would have made this film a even better film with a more compelling story but Wyler made this version a  original vision with a script that although very literate was problematic and awkward. As for Warner's offering: It is fit and comprehensive Ultimate collectors edition. Some complain of price after having issued a Collector's edition just a few years back. I think considering the offering this is a moderate price.
 This simply is the closest one will come to watching this production as it was seen. This is the highest most pristine resolution that this presentation will be given for a long time. The DVD packaging is superior quality and highly collectible. Considering the number of copies being made and that it includes some beautiful extras.
The Heston notebook with what seems like leather bounding and the production book is more elegant and extravagant than the last offering. That and the production book over time may alone be worth as much as the 45 dollar price. If one is a collector and a serious movie lover this is the one to get if not even the dvd version
at lesser 35$ is a well worth bargain. Consider that this offering has everything the last one did and more with the HD documentary with Heston's son Warner has outdone itself and Ben Hur has never looked better.  Down Venus! Up Mars!",1307923200,,3031,4.657943925233645

The story really shows a character named Judah Ben-Hur who is vengeful and strong-willed to fight for the freedom and justice of his people and family and defeat his power-hungry Roman best friend, Messala, who has turned evil and betrayed him, his mother and sister,for not siding with him,Caesar and the Roman Empire. As consequence,Judah battles many tests in his life,from imprisonment, to being a galley slave, competing in the classic chariot race against Messala, and a long desperate search for his mother and sister who have now become lepers cast away in a far away valley.

The moving scenes of Judah desperately searching for his mother and sister, imprisoned by Mesalla Judah's boyhood friend who betrayed him, and the chariot contest where Mesalla further cheated, lost and was killed are central in showing the human side of a man who first swore revenge on his betrayor, succeeded, and later found forgiveness because of one man. Judah's freeing of his slave, Ester, allowing her to be married to a man she barely knows, that had been arranged, later scorning her for being untruthful about the whereabouts of his mother and sister who had contracted leprosy, then falling in love with her as she convinced him that forgiveness not revenge was more acceptable in the eyes of God is also sufficient to make this a moving, unforgettable story.

There are dozens of titles (great titles, obviously), and when I stumble across one at the right price, I add it to my shelf . . . which has become the best looking shelf in my library.  Highly recommended, now on to Ben-Hur:

This is an iconic novel of Palestine, Rome, and Greece at around the beginning of the common era.  It is peopled with mostly fictional characters, the exception being the biblical Jesus, his followers, and various actual Roman and Jewish leaders of the era.

The syntax can be difficult at times. . . stilted, formal.  The story is of a young Jewish man, a subject of persecution by Rome, and his occasional crossing of paths with Jesus as the biblical story is woven in, and quite accurately I might add.  I am a fairly vigorous Bible scholar, and with above average knowledge regarding the city of Jerusalem.  I was extremely pleased with the Wallace recounting of the biblical tale, and fleshing it out with fictional detail.  Very believable and very accurate.  The plot is intricate, well told, and engaging.  The story was also very moving at times.

Regarding things ""religious"" . . . quiz a hundred people regarding Bible ""truth"" and you'll get a hundred responses.  That said, compared to my understanding of what the Bible says (which in my eyes is The Truth, and not always in alignment with mainstream.), I was much pleased that there were very few variations from this in Ben-Hur.

No point in my re-telling the novel for you. It's rewarding, as one of those reads you will always carry with you (mentally).  Do read this one.",1303862400,,1870,4.851735015772871

I won't give a laundry list of changes, but mention only two:  the chariot race (Ben-Hur still wins.) takes place in Antioch, Pontius Pilate is not there, and doesn't appear in the book.

1336982,5,B00003OSTA,"You read it right, folks. Not one, but TWO splendid film versions of General Lew Wallace's timeless story of a Prince Of Judea and his encounters with the Prince Of Peace are included in this epic collection. The first is the one we all know and love...the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston. Winner of 11 Academy Awards (a record which has been tied twice [once, I think, unfairly, in 1997] but hopefully will never be surpassed), William Wyler's epic blockbuster combines spectacle with the human drama of a man fighting for revenge and receiving redemption in the process. Every Oscar the movie won, it most definitely earned. I grew up watching the 1959 movie, and it's one of my favourites. Besides the well-known chariot race scene in Part II, the best scene is the one where Esther sees Miriam and Tirzah as they prepare to go to the Valley Of The Lepers. Just a heart-wrenching scene, and Mr. Rozsa's haunting score for the scene makes it all the more profound. The second version may be less well-known, but it's a classic, and the one that spawned the 1959 remake...the 1925 silent film version, now with restored Technicolor sequences and a score by Carl Davis recorded in 1990. I highly recommend both film versions. Miklos Rozsa's score for the 1959 film is well-done, and rightfully beloved, but the score for the 1925 film (especially Track 8-""The Chariot Race"") is equally impressive, and well-done. This 4 disc set also include two documentaries, screen tests, trailers, footage from the 1959 Academy Awards and more. You can't go wrong with ""Ben-Hur."" One of the greatest novels of all time is now TWO major motion pictures, and for the first time, both of them are available together. My only complaint (which is fairly minor) is that when you click on one of the menus, there's a screenshot of a deleted scene. The scene is not included as a bonus feature, and I'm curious to know why it was cut from the film and if the scene still exists. Rated G.

After the war he was a judge in the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, and Governor of the New Mexican Territory.

1336986,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben Hur is a fantastic film. Its a biblical film. I'm a person who's not a Christian and I'm vaguely deist in my religious beliefs. I used to be bothered the Christian message of the film, but I've gotten over it. It is too good of a movie to dismiss simply because of its religious message.

The movie takes place in New Testament times. The main character of the film is Ben Hur who is a Judean nobleman. He meets an old friend from childhood who is now a Roman tribune. His childhood friend asks that he help him in finding out about people who oppose Roman rule in Judea. Ben Hur refuses. Shortly after when the new governor of Judea is marching into town, and he passes by Ben Hur's home on his horse Ben Hur's sister accidently knocks a tile off the roof and the new governor is hit by a tile and his horse is startled and he falls to the ground. For this accident Ben Hur's sister and mother are imprisoned and Ben Hur is sentenced for life to the galleys.

Ben Hur perfectly captured what it was like to live in the Roman empire. At the beginning of the movie at one point Roman soldiers are shown marching through a small village while Judeans stand by looking at them. It looks totally realistic like your actually watching actual footage shot in New Testament times of Roman troops marching by. The other great scene is the chariot race which seems 100 percent realistic. It definitely ranks as one of the best action scenes in movie history.

While Ben Hur is going through his ordeal in the galley, the Christian religion is manifesting itself so Ben Hur is contemporary with the rising of a new age. The movie for the most part denounces the Roman empire as heartless. There are good Romans in the movie and not all of them are portrayed as evil.

The DVD which is the four disc collectors edition contains two documentaries and also contains the silent version of Ben Hur made in the 1920s with Ramon Navarro as the lead actor. One of the documentaries was made in the 1990s and it has film historians and others talking about the making of the film. The most interesting of the people who talk in the documentary is the novelist Gore Vidal who is really funny. It also has a guy who worked on the chariot race talking about how they did it.

Ben Hur is the most memorable epic about ancient Rome and it brings the New Testament era to life.",1290470400,,2356,4.36986301369863
1336987,5,B00003OSTA,"Boiled down to its essence: man gets wronged, man devotes life to revenge, man learns lesson in the process.  ""Ben Hur"" is nothing more than a simple, straightforward revenge tale, and it is this fact, despite the history and spirituality injected into the tale, that makes this book such an accomplishment.
  Judah, who we will eventually know as Ben Hur, gets falsely accused of trying to assassinate a Roman official.  His sister and mother are imprisoned, possibly killed, and he is sent off to work as a galley slave, essentially condemned to die by overwork.  Through a lucky series of events, he is freed and devotes his life- through military training and strategic planning- through exacting revenge against the man responsible for the punishment.  The culmination of this revenge plot is the famous chariot race, which is the true masterpiece of this work.  The build up to it, the actual race itself, and the aftermath provide a powerful set piece that lends momentum to the rest of the book.
  While all this is going on, Ben Hur crosses paths with Balthasar, one of the three kings who visited the newborn Jesus, and gets dragged into Jewish politics in anticipation of the arrival of the King of the Jews.  Having exacted his revenge and then dealing with the spiritual crisis that followed, Ben Hur's collision course with Jesus Christ- Ben Hur is there at the crucifixion- culminates in the ultimate Christian redemption story.
  Aside from the obvious Christians aspects, which are dealt with an a non-evangelical way, the story is powerful because it taps into some of the most universal human emotions.  Love of family, desire for justice, and even the struggles of lust play a major part in this story. Stripped of Wallace's descriptive and playful language, the story stands on its own as a powerful tale of revenge and morality.  Wallace's every written word further propels it to the realm of classic.
  Spiritual, action packed, philosophical, inspiring- an all around great book!",1290384000,,2004,4.972972972972973

1337009,3,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is an 1880 historical novel by Lew Wallace. In the time of Christ, Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur is sent to the Roman galleys for an accidental ""assassination attempt"" on the Roman governor. The book chronicles his attempts to free himself and locate his mother and sister; along the way he has various encounters with biblical characters, including Jesus himself.

Ben-Hur is full of rich historical detail. Wallace certainly did his research, although his blond-haired and blue-eyed Mary and Jesus are rather egregious and indefensible. The works and miracles that Christ does, and their effects on the characters, give the book a significant emotional weight. Beyond that, Wallace's characters love to sit around and discuss theology in detail, and there's quite a bit of solid Christology to be found here.

The story in Ben-Hur is fantastic, but Wallace has written a bloated, flawed novel. Characters and dialogue are flat, the plot often advances by means of convenient developments, and the book makes great jumps through time to place Ben-Hur at so many key events in the life of Christ, which causes his own actions not to make a lot of sense. But worst of all, the novel is all over the place. Wallace is rambling and verbose, and there are too many half-baked story elements: The love triangle, such as it is, adds nothing to the story. Messala is not developed as a friend or as an enemy. A 65-page introduction that does nothing other than relate the Nativity story is unnecessary.

It is worth mentioning William Wyler's 1959 MGM film that starred Charlton Heston and won 11 Oscars; there have been other films, but it is through that movie that the Ben-Hur story is known to the most people now. The movie distills the overlong, wandering story down to its key elements, developing them to a fulfilling degree, and the story is all the more powerful for it. It's a great story, and the film, which is one of the greatest ever, in any genre, takes full advantage of it.

The novel Ben-Hur is a powerful, moving story not at all well told. It pains me to say this, but the movie is better. Considerably.",1286841600,,2145,4.773584905660377

I've watched this movie so many times I know what scene is occurring just by hearing what part of the dramatic score is playing.  The actors are of the finest caliber.  They don't make actors like that any more, they seem straight out of the classical world of theater, having so much beauty and raw power in every expression and every movement.  Every line is classic and potent, even though there is not much dialogue, which should be a disappointment for me because I love clever scripts and smart dialogue; however, the actors are so great at acting that their faces and actions say more than they ever could, so I don't mind the sparseness of the spoken word.

It may be too dated for some, but the galley scene and the chariot race scene are some of the greatest ""action"" scenes there are. Brutal and violent as well.  I can't believe my mother let me watch the galley scenes when I was six or seven.

The book is great as well and different from the movie, however both cover what all great stories are about, glory and tragedy and the fall and rise in between.  If anything, watch the movie for Charlton Heston's performance. If you want to see a man and a man with all of his emotions ( rage, sorrow, revengeful, unable to comprehend), than there is no better place to see one than Heston's Judah Ben Hur.

Ben-Hur,s faith gets him through many tough trials, although there are times when he almost looses it. One thing in the movie that really impressed me was: whenever they portrayed Jesus, His face was not shown.  They showed His kindness, generosity, and love by what He did and by the reactions of others and the looks on their faces.  There is some romance involved and some history and much Bible; and the famous horse race; one good line I appreciated was ""don't treat my horses like animals!""

1337067,4,B00003OSTA,"Have you ever seen someone heal a leper right before your eyes?  How about a high speed chariot race?  ""Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ"" is a form of religious fiction.  Since it is set in the same time period as the life of Jesus, it shows what His ministry was like from the eyes and mindset of people who could have actually been there.  It is almost like witnessing the story first hand.  Although this novel is fiction, it displays a sense of realism as if it really did occur.

This is a great book for anyone to read, however, it would be best for people who enjoy realistic fiction and are at least somewhat familiar with the life of Christ.  The audience should be patient because some sections of the book, especially the first several chapters, can become dull because they take a long time to introduce minor characters.  It does get better though.  There is a very exciting chariot race scene full of action and danger.

I really thought that it was interesting reading the thoughts and opinions of people who could have lived during the time of Christ.  I liked how it showed Christ's life in a different perspective.  I believe that this is worth reading because it is important to have another view of this time period apart from the Bible.  Having another view of the time period is important because it helps you understand the setting and what is going on.

This book shows a normal man and how he has his life affected by Jesus in a major way.  Even though it is fiction, I believe that this is the most realistic, Biblical fiction book I have read.  Despite the occasional tedious parts, I highly recommend this book because the rest of it is an exciting story.",1263427200,,1680,4.4769736842105265
1337088,4,B00003OSTA,"Focus on the Family does a superb job with their dramatization of this classic novel.  It is full of wonderful sound effects and talented voices (even if some of the Roman soldiers did sound like Cockneys or Aussies.  Maybe they were recruits from those Roman territories.  ha ha ha).

As for the story itself, I had never heard the tale of Ben Hur and so it was all new and fresh to me.  It is an enjoyable story in the tradition of The Robe and The Greatest Story Ever Told.  And like those two books, when the story of Ben Hur touches on the life of Jesus it tends to stray from the strict Biblical facts.  However, since Jesus only makes a couple of brief appearances in Ben Hur, this wasn't too troubling (unlike as in The Robe which I was unable to finish because I was so turned off by its adherence to church lore rather than Biblical truth).

The story of Ben Hur centers on Judah Ben Hur and his struggles through hardship and injustice, his desire for revenge, and his ultimate victory.  Although Focus on the Family does an excellent dramatization, I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because the story line is a bit weak.

1337093,4,B00003OSTA,"Lew Wallace was actually a pretty interesting guy. He was a lawyer, a Civil War Union General, and Governor for the New Mexico Territory. In terms of cultural history, Ben-Hur is actually a pretty interesting book. Wikipedia tells me that until 1936 (when Gone With the Wind was released) it was the best selling American novel. It has never been out of print since its date of publication. What I knew already about the book was that it returned the feeling of morality to the popular novel-- it quickly became required reading at public schools and Sunday schools alike.

Before it became a popular film (which I have never seen, by the way-- limited patience for toga flicks) it was also a popular stage play. An online article by Amy Lifson tells me that twenty million people saw it staged between 1899 and 1920. (And a revival arrived this past September in London, by the way.)

But all this is history. What is it like to read? I was dreading it, a little bit, because I had heard about the tedious and long pages of description and dated plot. I have to say though, it really wasn't bad. Once I got into the text I found that it read rather quickly, and it was hard not to feel how much effort Wallace had put into historical research and detail. Part of his mission, quite clearly, had been to bring some realism to the typical understanding of the nativity story. (The Christ is born in a cave, not a manger, etc.)

The main plot actually has little to do with religion, and has all the typical potboiler elements. A choice between the good girl and the bad girl; A prince falsely accused by a bad man; leprosy endured and cured. It's all very exciting and keeps the pages turning. Some of the description does go on and on (and Wallace isn't Dickens, it sometimes isn't charming) but I found it easy enough to blow through those sections and into the next bit of exciting plot.

I don't know how much I would recommend this as a reading experience, exactly. Probably interesting, if you're excited by the history of the popular novel and want to trace this book's influence on popular culture.",1259625600,,2105,4.531578947368421

1337095,2,B00003OSTA,"I watched the movie Ben-Hur 8-10 years ago, and I enjoyed it. So, I finally got around to getting the book and giving it a go. It pales in comparison to the movie. If I had not previously seen the movie, I would have dropped the book in the first section with the long drawn-out description of the wise men meeting and finding the Christ, and the shepherds, and Mary and Joseph, etc. Besides going significantly beyond what Scripture says, the 60+ pages made almost no real contribution to the main story and could have been pared down to less than 10.

I pressed on and persevered because I had enjoyed the movie, but it was a struggle. There were many long and boring narrative parts, many of them totally unessential to the story. This title would probably be in complete obscurity these days if not for the movie. I skimmed heavily through many sections, and by the end, was just glad to finally be done. This book would have been much improved by good editing choices to cut its length by half.

I would only recommend this book to those who *really* enjoyed the movie and like long narrative texts. Or who really want to read the alternate account of the miraculous healings, the only thing I think was better about the book. Otherwise, no, I would not recommend it. I have enjoyed many ""classics"" over the years, and many books that others would only read for school. But, this is not one of them.",1258502400,,1404,4.48046875

1337110,4,B00003OSTA,"BEN-HUR isn't really a film about Jesus, or rather it's a film in which Jesus is the main character, but he's never seen except in partial glimpses, never heard. Rather he is the character around whom the life and fortunes of the Jewish prince, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) revolves, though he doesn't know it until quite late in the film.

I haven't read the 1880 novel by General Lew Wallace, and I hadn't seen either the 1907 1-reeler or the 1925 Fred Niblo version, also a long and expensive epic, before re-watching this recently. But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple: Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a ""real time"" you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.

But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too: achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.

This isn't a huge flaw for me, however, as I realize how difficult such a dramatization is, and in particular when filmed by believing Jews and Christians and intended for an audience that had not yet tired of such simple homilies and the grand scale that the film does, at least, still impress with. The acting is all pretty much what one expects in such a thing - lots of declamations and stagy, overly dramatic glances, hands thrown up at the site of lepers, etc. The photography is quite beautiful if completely unrealistic - this never really looks like the holy land, never really even looks like the real world, with a lot of dreamy overlit closeups, deep shadows when deemed dramatically necessary, interior lighting that is sometimes indistinguishable from exteriors -- none of it matters really, if you accept that this is ""big scale Hollywood Biblical melodrama"" and look at it in terms of its success as a genre piece. I like a lot of the actors in smaller roles, particularly Frank Thring as a somewhat sympathetic, realistic Pontius Pilate whose words of wisdom Ben Hur rejects in one of the best scenes in a film that is really dominated by intimate character interludes despite its reputation for spectacle.

On the whole, it works for me, Wyler is a fluid enough storyteller to keep things moving despite the immense length and the extremely wide format is rarely a distraction, if rarely necessary either. It's easy to see why this was such an immense hit, earning the equivalent of over $700 million today theatrically; it's also to see why it marked the peak of the genre and why it all went downhill rather quickly, as it was such a grueling production that few filmmakers would want to tackle such a thing again even with the potential of very large returns. By 1966 or so (John Huston's THE BIBLE) the genre was effectively dead, at least on such a large scale.",1255305600,,5049,4.600443951165372

1337112,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is a 1959 epic film directed by William Wyler, and is the third film version of Lew Wallace's 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a feat equaled only by Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

The film's prologue depicts the traditional story of the birth of Jesus Christ. Twenty-six years later, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy merchant of noble blood in Jerusalem. Preceding the arrival of a new governor, Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), a military Tribune, returns as the new commanding officer of the Roman garrison. At first Judah and Messala are happy to meet after years apart, but their differing political views separate them: Messala believes in the glory of Rome and worldly imperial power, while Ben-Hur is devoted to his faith and the Jewish people. Messala asks Ben-Hur to caution his countrymen about protests, uprisings, or criticism of the Roman government. Judah counsels his countrymen against rebellion but refuses to disclose dissidents' names, and the two part in anger.

Judah's family welcomes two of their slaves who arrive with a caravan from Antioch: Simonides (Sam Jaffe), their loyal steward, and Simonides's daughter Esther (Haya Harareet), who is preparing for an arranged marriage. Judah gives Esther her freedom as a wedding present, and the two realize they are attracted to each other.

During the welcoming parade for the new Roman governor, a tile falls from the roof of Ben-Hur's house and startles the governor's horse, which throws him off, nearly killing him. Although Messala knows that it was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Judah's mother Miriam (Martha Scott) and sister Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell), in an effort to intimidate the restive Jewish populace by punishing the family of a known friend. Ben-Hur swears to return and take revenge. En route to the sea, he is denied water when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth. He collapses in despair, but a then-unknown Jesus Christ gives him water and renews his will to survive.

After three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), tasked by the Emperor to destroy a fleet of Macedonian pirates. The commander notices Ben-Hur's self-discipline and resolve, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer, but Ben-Hur declines, declaring that God will aid him.

As Arrius prepares the galley for battle, he orders the rowers chained but unaccountably orders 41 (Ben-Hur) to be left unchained. When the pirates attack the Romans, Arrius's galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur escapes and saves Arrius's life and, since Arrius believes the battle ended in defeat, also prevents him from committing suicide during their time afloat. Eventually, they are rescued by a Roman vessel and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory, and in gratitude petitions Tiberius Julius Caesar (George Relph) to drop all charges against Judah, eventually adopting Judah as his son. With regained freedom and wealth, Judah learns Roman ways and becomes a champion charioteer.
On his journey home to Judea, he happens to become acquainted with an Arab sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith), along with Balthasar (Finlay Currie), who owns four magnificent white Arabian horses and wishes to have them trained for chariot racing. Discovering that Judah had been a winning charioteer in Rome, Ilderim introduces him to his ""children"" and requests that he drive his quadriga in the upcoming race before the new governor, Pontius Pilate (Frank Thring). Ben-Hur accepts upon learning that Messala, considered the finest charioteer in Judea, will also compete in the race. (As Ben-Hur is leaving, Ilderim adds, ""There is no law in the arena. Many are killed."")

Returning to Judea, Judah finds that Esther's arranged marriage did not occurr and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands that he free his mother and sister; Messala sends Drusus (Terence Longdon) to the fortress to look for them. When the soldiers enter the cell, they discover that Miriam and Tirzah have contracted leprosy, and they turn them out of the city. Esther learns of their condition when she finds the two women after nightfall in the Hur house's courtyard; and they beseech her to conceal their condition from Judah and allow him to remember them as they were. Esther tells Judah that his mother and sister have died in prison.

In the run-up to the chariot race, we see a wide-screen view of the imposing Circus building and nine four-horse chariots. Ilderim warns Ben-Hur that Messala has a ""Greek chariot,"" with blades on the hubs, designed to chew up opposing chariots that get too close. In the violent and grueling chariot race, Messala removes several opponents by damaging their chariots with his beaked hubs, but in a collision he falls and is run over and trampled, sustaining severe injuries. After receiving the victor's laurel wreath from Pilate, Judah visits Messala in the infirmary, where surgeons are amputating both legs in a futile attempt to save his life. Before dying, Messala bitterly tells Judah that the race is not over: he can find his mother and sister in the ""Valley of the Lepers."" Judah leaves in anguish to search for his family, and he is devastated when he finds them in their diseased and disfigured condition.

The film is subtitled ""A Tale of the Christ"", and it is at this point that Jesus reappears. Esther witnesses the Sermon on the Mount and is moved by Christ's words. She tells Ben-Hur about it, but he remains bitter and will not be consoled. Learning that Tirzah is dying, they take her and Miriam to see Jesus, but they cannot get near him, as his trial has begun. (We don't hear the testimony, verdict, or sentence; but we see Pilate famously washing his hands.) Recognizing Jesus from his encounter with him as he was being taken to the galleys, Judah attempts to give him water during his march to Calvary, echoing Jesus' kindness to him, but he is shoved away by the guards.

Eventually, Judah witnesses the Crucifixion. Immediately after Christ's death, Miriam and Tirzah are healed by a miracle, as are Judah's heart and soul. He returns to his home and tells Esther that as he heard Jesus talk of forgiveness while on the cross, ""I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand."" The film, which had begun with the Magi visiting the infant Jesus, ends with the empty crosses of Calvary in the background and a shepherd and his flock (a prominent Christian symbol) in the foreground.
Many other men were offered the role of Ben-Hur before Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster claimed he turned down the role of Ben-Hur because he ""didn't like the violent morals in the story"". Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. Rock Hudson and Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role.

Out of respect, and consistent with Lew Wallace's stated preference, the face of Jesus is never shown. He was played by opera singer Claude Heater, who received no credit for his only film role.

The original design for the boat Ben-Hur is enslaved upon was so heavy that it couldn't float. The scene therefore had to be filmed in a studio, but another problem remained: the cameras didn't fit inside, so the boat was cut in half and made able to be wider or shorter on demand. The next problem was that the oars were too long, so those were cut too; however, this made it look unrealistic, because the oars were too easy to row; so weights were added to the ends.

During filming, director Wyler noticed that one of the extras was missing a hand. He had the man's stump covered in false blood, with a false bone protruding from it, to add realism to the scene when the galley is rammed. Wyler made similar use of another extra who was missing a foot.

The galley sequence includes the successive commands from Arrius, ""Battle speed, Hortator... Attack speed... Ramming speed!"" The word hortator is no longer in use, and is notably absent from most modern dictionaries. It was a Latin word that on a ship meant ""chief of the rowers"", or ""he who has command over the rowers"",[1] and likely has roots in the Latin verb hortor (""to exhort, encourage""). The command ""Ramming speed, Hortator!"", which is widely remembered and parodied, never occurs.

The galley sequence is purely fictional, as the Roman navy, in contrast to its early modern counterparts, did not employ convicts as galley slaves.[2]

The chariot race in Ben-Hur was directed by Andrew Marton, a Hollywood director who often acted as second unit director on other people's films. Even by current standards, it is considered to be one of the most spectacular action sequences ever filmed. Filmed at Cinecitt Studios outside Rome long before the advent of computer-generated effects, it took over three months to complete, using 15,000 extras on the largest film set ever built, some 18 acres (73,000 m2).[citation needed] Eighteen chariots were built, with half being used for practice. The race took five weeks to film. Tour buses visited the set every hour.

The section in the middle of the circus, the spina, is a known feature of circi, although its size may be exaggerated to aid filmmaking. The golden dolphin lap counter was a feature of the Circus Maximus in Rome.

Charlton Heston spent four weeks learning how to drive a chariot. He was taught by the stunt crew, who offered to teach the entire cast, but Heston and Boyd were the only ones who took them up on the offer (Boyd had to learn in just two weeks, due to his late casting). At the beginning of the chariot race, Heston shook the reins and nothing happened; the horses remained motionless. Finally someone way up on top of the set yelled, ""Giddy-up!"" The horses then roared into action, and Heston was flung backward off the chariot.[citation needed]

To give the scene more impact and realism, three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots. Most notable is the stand-in dummy for Stephen Boyd's Messala that gets tangled up under the horses, getting battered by their hooves. This resulted in one of the most grisly fatal injuries in motion picture history up until then, and shocked audiences
There are several urban legends surrounding the chariot sequence, one of which states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, ""We had a stunt man killedin the third week, and it happened right in front of me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie"".[3] There is no conclusive evidence to back up Powell's claim and it has been adamantly denied by director William Wyler, who states that neither man nor horse was injured in the famous scene. The movie's stunt director, Yakima Canutt, stated that no serious injuries or deaths occurred during filming.[4]

Another urban legend states that a red Ferrari can be seen during the chariot race; the book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth.[5] (Heston, in the DVD commentary track, mentions a third urban legend that is not true: That he wore a wristwatch. He points out that he was wearing leather bracers right up to the elbow.)

However, one of the best-remembered moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident. When Ben-Hur's chariot jumps another chariot which has crashed in its path, the charioteer is seen to be almost thrown from his mount and only just manages to hang on and climb back in to continue the race. In reality, while the jump was planned, the character being flipped into the air was not planned, and stuntman Joe Canutt, son of stunt director Yakima Canutt, was considered fortunate to escape with only a minor chin injury. Nonetheless, when director Wyler intercut the long shot of Canutt's leap with a close-up of Heston clambering back into his chariot, a memorable scene resulted.[6]

[edit] Differences between novel and film
There are several differences between the original novel and the film. The changes made serve to make the film's storyline more immediately dramatic.

In the novel, Messala is seriously, but not fatally, injured in the chariot race. In the movie, Messala falls victim to an accident that is caused by his own attempts to sabotage Ben-Hur, and he dies from the wounds sustained from the accident. In the book, Messala plots to have Ben-Hur murdered in revenge, but his plans go awry. It is revealed at the end of the novel that Iras (who is Messala's mistress and does not appear in the 1959 film) had murdered Messala in a fit of anger about five years after the chariot race.
In the novel, Ben-Hur becomes a convert to Christianity before, rather than after, the Crucifixion, and he does not display the harsh bitterness that he does in the William Wyler film. Similarly, the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister takes place earlier in the book, not immediately after the death of Christ.
In the novel, the character of Quintus Arrius was acquainted with Ben-Hur's father, but in the movie there was no such prior association between the Arrius and Ben-Hur families. In the novel, Arrius dies and passes his property and title on to Ben-Hur prior to Ben-Hur's return home. No mention of Arrius's death is made in the 1959 film, so presumably he is still alive at film's end.
The novel ends about five years after the chariot race, with the Ben-Hur family living in Rome. Learning that Sheik Ilderim (who does not die in any of the film versions of the novel) had bequeathed him a large amount of money, and learning of the persecution of Christians in Rome, Ben-Hur helps establish the Catacomb of San Calixto so that the Christian community will have a place to worship freely. The movie however ends almost immediately after the Crucifixion of Christ and the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister.
[edit] Claims of homosexual subtext
In interviews for the 1986 book Celluloid Closet, and later the 1995 documentary of the same name, screenwriter Gore Vidal asserts that he had persuaded director William Wyler to allow a carefully veiled homoerotic subtext between Messala and Ben-Hur. Vidal says his aim was to explain Messala's extreme reaction to Ben-Hur's refusal to name his fellow Jews to a Roman officer. Vidal suggested that Messala and Ben-Hur had been lovers while growing up, but Ben-Hur rejected him, so it is the anger of a scorned lover which motivates Messala's vindictiveness. Since the Hollywood production code would not permit this to appear on screen explicitly, it would have to be implied by the actors. Vidal claims that Wyler took his advice, and that the results can be seen in the film. Wyler was initially hesitant to implement the subtext, but agreed on the conditions that no direct reference ever be made to the characters' sexuality in the script, that Vidal personally discuss the idea with Stephen Boyd, and not mention the subtext to Charlton Heston who, Wyler feared, would panic at the idea.[7] After Vidal admitted to adding the homosexual subtext in public, Heston denied the claim, going so far as to suggest Vidal had little input into the final script, and his lack of screen credit was a result of his being fired for trying to add gay innuendo. Vidal rebutted by citing passages from Heston's 1978 autobiography An Actor's Life, where the actor admitted that Vidal had authored much of the final shooting script.",1253923200,,15777,4.904047976011994
1337113,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is a terrific drama.  As a 40ish mom, I was on the cusp of the classic Hollywood film with Charlton Heston as Ben-Hur.  I recall the iconic images, but not the story.  Ben Hur has quickly become one of our family favorites.
This production is appropriate for my 9 year old daughter. I think boys and girls, young and old alike will enjoy this drama.  There are sevearl teaching moments, where we could stop and explain or discuss what was going on and why.  This enriches the scope of knowlege and helps children to imagine, say, the horrible conditions of being a slave chained to the galleys.  There is love triangle aspect which is easily recognized by a 9 year old girl, but appropriatly depicted ala Focus on the Family.
The story has a VERY interesting perspective.  Ben Hur's story is parallel to the birth and life of Jesus Christ and makes several references to The Messiah.  Some characters are completely convinced, other skeptic.  Still others like Ben are hopeful, but have misconceptions.

Prospective buyers should not be misled by the ""cover"" image currently being displayed for this e-book.  Contrary to the image, this edition is NOT published by Signet and contains no introduction.  I downloaded a sample of this edition to my Kindle, and from that downloaded content it is quite obvious that this edition has nothing to do with Signet.  By all appearances, it is rather just another small-scale e-book publisher looking to sell public domain content.  The e-book contains a table of contents, but one which does not actually link to the listed chapters.

Just to be clear, I do not take issue in the least with someone selling public domain material.  What I object to is the mischaracterization as to who produced the e-book in question.  Assuming an appropriate price, I may be willing to purchase an e-book of a public domain work if the particular edition contains introductory material, professionally formatted text, and/or footnotes and endnotes.  This edition, however, contains none of those.  For that reason I would recommend to the prospective buyer that they save their money and instead seek a freely available e-book of Ben Hur, which can be obtained from scores of different sites on the Internet.",1241136000,,1741,5.979838709677419
1337144,5,B00003OSTA,"You don't have to be a Christian (though I am) to enjoy this massive Magnum Opus of drama, forgiveness, revenge, action, and rich dialouge.  Besides, there is no story in the bible that mirrors this, as the origins of this movie is historical fiction.  Now that even satanists have no way to back up their hate of this movie because it's not shoving any bible stories (and their messages, if any) in their face!

Though this movie is extremely long at four hours, this movie doesn't move along at a snail's pace.  Rather, this movie truly benefits from the extended scene lengths, never rushing anything, letting each subtle human emotion and character come through through slow self discovery on the viewers part.  Case in point.  When Judah and Messala meet for the first time, watching them go from erratic emotion of being reunited, and watcing that emotion dissolve into disagreement, then finally parting in anger, well, that path would take time in the real world, and Ben-Hur nails that aspect with great ease.  It's just one fine example, and it's the reason why the movie does a great job of telling the story and all of it's emotions.

The action sequences, when there are ones, are also not rushed.  The Chariot race is painstankingly done in great detail, you can feel like your actually there.  The camera shots, well, the film snob in me could go on and on with production techniques and other ways that makes this movie as engaging as it is.

And wow, the production values are amazing.  They spend their money well.  The sets on here are absolutely grand, as for the props. JUST LOOK AT THAT TEMPLE!  The whole backdrop of the shooting star in the prolouge, gorgeous.  I find the bible landscapes amazing when I picture them in my head, and this movie only further shows why I think it that way.  Even if you don't, well, shame on you.

I don't want to spoil much of the plot, but it's truly long-winded.  While it's very easy to follow, it's extremely sprawling and by the time it is over, you will feel like you have gone all kinds of places.  My rather dry description of it's epic feel doesn't really do justice to it's amazing use of that at all.  I do apologize.  The acting itself is very good, and the actors make the aforementioed pace of the scenes interesting and engaging throughout.

The DVD itself has fine picture quality (obviously), though my only petty prude complaint is the .  All the bonus features only add to it, and it features plenty of essential DVD mainstays (commentary) to keep you entertained long after it's four hours.  And this doesn't even include the fact you can watch it more than once!

This is the only movie that truly deserves that many Academy Awards, something that Titanic or Lord of The Rings wish it deserved.  But I digress.  If you want a thought-provoking, entertaining, and grand movie Ben-Hur is not to be missed.  Truly inspirational and still awesome to watch today.",1240099200,,2936,4.648543689320388

Ben Hur is about the wickedness of evil men; their love for money and power.  That evil resulting in the persecution of the righteous because of their faith in the One True God.  The movie is about the grace and sovereignty of God toward believers; His redemption and restoration of those who fear His name, and His final judgement of the wicked.

The movie is a beautiful story of God's love for justice.  It portrays mans free will to choose;  The choice to do good, or to choose to do evil.  In turn the One Judge, God Himself, declares the final outcome;  each man will receive what he sowed; the one, judgement for evil, the other, blessings for good.

To my mind, there will never be a more memorable motion picture scene than the breakneck  arena chariot race and the headlong drive to the finish line by the  dauntless Judah Ben-Hur played by Charlton Heston. But for me the most moving scene was in the sweltering heat of the Egyptian desert where Heston and the enslaved Jews were being force-marched to the slave galleys. The viewer is treated to an incident in which Heston, who is close to physical collapse, is offered a cup of water by Christ, Whose back we are confined to witnessing, suddenly appears on the scene. What is particularly striking is the effect His presence has on the non-resisting Roman soldier who is standing beside the fallen Heston.

1337165,5,B00003OSTA,"Wow, what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored, not the garbage they salute today?

In other words, this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time. Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race, for instance, perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects.

This can be a very sad film as well. I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points. The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart.

The combination of drama, action and romance, along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack, once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music, the more was is moved by it.

To fully appreciate  all of the above, including the wonderful cinematography in this film, I recommend you purchase this 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story, the silent movie ""Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ."" That was name of the book, by the way, the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films.  The restoration job here on that' 59 film, by the way, is fantastic. Ben-Hur has never looked better.

Both versions are outstanding. In summary, this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an ""epic"" movie. It's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen.....and it's never looked nor sounded better than on this DVD version.",1232668800,,1716,4.643564356435643
1337166,5,B00003OSTA,"""Ben_Hur, a Tale of THE CHRIST"" is in my opinion one of the best books ever written (and so much better than the movie).  It deals with the most important question presented to humanity:  ""Who was Jesus Christ?"" Lew Wallace spent much of his early life ambivalent to that question, and thus understands that getting the answer right isn't necessarily an easy process. Read the book and it will help you answer the question for yourself.
Then read Robinson Crusoe, an equally beautiful rendition of a difficult faith walk.
In both you will end with this fact, both Wallace and Defoe believed that  ""The Lord Jesus Christ is who He says He is in the Bible....He is the God who saves"".",1232236800,,682,4.619834710743802

This particular DVD set gives you the full background of this film including the feature version and it also includes the silent version of 1925 that is glorious. This version of 1959 is the second greatest film ever made coming a close second to 'The Ten Commandments.' William Wyler has wrenched his full emotions while making this film and the magic has been brought out alive on the screen also principally through the majestic score of Miklos Rozsa. In fact, this score even eclipses the super effort of Elmer Bernstein for the Ten Commandments. The theme of Christ and the individual themes of Judah Ben Hur, Messala and the suffering leprosiac mother/sister are excellent examples of background scoring. Charlton Heston scores in a big way once again in the principal role of Judah Ben Hur. Stephen Boyd as Messala is stunning and is as forceful as Heston. They are ably supported by Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius. This is a Tale of the Christ with Christ shown only in the background. This is done in a masterful way. The crucifixion, the storm succeeding it, the Sermon on the Mount, Christ helping Judah with water and the reverse during the climb to Golgotha are very subtly captured with mesmerising music by Rozsa. If you feel films are a document of a director's expression, then this is one jewel to be treasured. Lew Wallace's novel has been given a crown with this screenplay. This is Wyler's best effort.

This is the best American movie ever made. Everything is done superbly. Great story, outstanding acting, fantastic picture made with 65mm cameras, masterful music score. It is hard to find anything bad about this movie.

 Aspect ratio of this movie is incredible 2.76:1. On standard 4:3 TV black bars will occupy more space than the movie itself. This method creates spectacular panoramic shots which is important for epic movies with great action scenes.

Chariot race is one of the best action sequences ever shot in a movie. With no digital computer effects it is a true masterpiece. Pod racing looks great in Star Wars Episode 1 but it is entirely done digitally, something not available in 1959.

In 36 page booklet about the production (included with 2005 edition) it is mentioned that Judah's horses in the movie are actually world famous Lipizzaners. As gray horses they are born black or bay but during their lifetime they become lighter every year and finally become white. They originate from farms around village Lipizza in Slovenia and they are used in the world oldest and most famous Spanish Ridding School (formed in 1572) in Vienna, Austria. Only stallions are used for dressage. Unlike racing horses, these live very long, reaching 30 eventually. In 2005, when new 4-disc set of Ben-Hur was reissued, it was exactly 60 years from the time when general Patton rescued these horses from extinction. During WWII, Nazis captured entire breeding stock and shipped it back to Germany. Rescue had to be made behind Soviet lines to prevent them from ending in Soviet hands as horsemeat.

Chariot race places Judah against his old buddy Messala who sent him to slavery and imprisoned his mother and sister. Judah uses this race to destroy Messala's ego and end his streak of invincibility in the Forum.  Messala rides Greek chariot with black horses, equipped with metal spikes to crush other competitors because there are no rules that ban such thing. Everything is allowed. After his chariot crashes, he refuses to be operated, he waits for Judah to come to him. The only reason why he is waiting for Judah is not to show remorse or regret for his past actions against Judah and his family but to commit his final act of evil, his last words tell Judah that he can seek his mother and sister in ""Valley of the Lepers"", if he can recognize them. We can only wish that George Lucas made Dart Vader more like Messala. His body completely broken, bathed in his own blood and waiting to die he uses little life left in him to make Judah suffer even more. Stephen Boyd portrayal of Messala is one of the best evil guy acts ever made.

Movie is the winner of eleven Academy Awards. Charlton Heston gave his best performance ever and won Oscar. It is shame that Stephen Boyd didn't win it, he got only Golden Globe Award for best Supporting Actor.",1215734400,,3044,5.06187624750499
1337198,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is an epic tale of childhood friends who ended up on opposite sides of a very harsh line in the time of Christ. The movie is an undeniable classic, and epic in every way. Fun to watch, powerful, touching at times - a must see!",1215648000,,234,4.108695652173913
1337199,5,B00003OSTA,"First time I saw this film was on the big screen during it's 10th anniversary re-release in 1969 when I was 12. Couldn't take my eyes off it! It has everything a 12 year old kid wants in a film: action, adventure, visual splendor and even an emotional story that you can learn something from.

We all know the story about two childhood friends, one Jew, the other a Roman, caught up in the turbulent times of Roman imperialism only to be split apart as adults due to their own ideology and becoming bitter enemies. The full title suggests A Tale of the Christ, which is not necesssarily true. The Christ figure serves more as metaphoric backdrop, referencing Jesus' teachings of brotherhood and it's impact on a common man, Juda Ben Hur.

This is what seperates Ben Hur from most other Biblical epics. It carries a highly emotional human drama despite all the visual splendor. Lessons on humility and redemption are delivered with a sledgehammer.

The film was a make-or-break gamble for MGM, who was on the verge of bankruptsy at the time due to the increasing popularity of television. No expense was spared by producer Sam Zimbalist bringing in two time Academy Award winning director William Wyler along with several writers like Gor Vidal and a $10 million dollar budget. With the odds against MGM, the film still ended up being one of the most successful films in history bringing in a record 11 Academy Awards, a record that was held for almost 40 years until Cameron's Titanic tied it.

This DVD set does the film justice for many reasons. First and foremost is the restoration of the film itself. Great care was taken to bring more vibrancy to the picture quality. Previous prints had some color desaturation due to age and poor handling. The most noticable was during the famous chariot race where a tint of yellow was clearly visible on the right side of the screen. That and the usual grain and other artifacts have been eliminated bringing us the best picture this film has had since it's release. As for the sound, it's pretty much the same as the previous DVD release done in 2003, I really don't think there's much improvement that can be made given the technology at the time. But it still sounds great, especially during the crucifixation scene when the thunder really thunders giving your sub-woofer a real workout.

The extras are plentiful highlighted by the inclusion of the original 1925 silent version which that in itself looks great in terms of production, storytelling and restoration of the film as well. Other extras include the previously released documentary narrated by Christopher Plummer (love his voice!) and a new documentary focusing on the impact the film made on contemporary filmmakers. We get interviews with Ridely Scott, who did the heavily Ben Hur influenced Gladiator, and good old George Lucas on the inspiration the film had on Star Wars.  Funny thing is, when I first saw The Phantom Menace, I instantly knew Georgie boy modeled the pod race after Ben's chariot race! And I was right! Other extras include some screen tests by other actors (like Detective Frank Drebin auditioning for the role of Masala!), production stills and the like.

All in all, this a great package to have of one of Hollywood's most legendary classic epics. If you love action, adventure, romance and raw emotional storytelling, this is it.

Blu-ray update:

Take this set and frisbee it! Ben Hur Blu-ray is here at last. After years of delays for the 50th anniversary the wait has been well worth it. Warner made the right decision to say to hell with release schedules and took their sweet time putting this release together. A meticulous frame by frame restoration of the original 70mm negative done at a 6k scan has resulted in the most perfect image you going to see of this classic epic. Colors are bright and sharp as a razor, you can count the hairs and beads of sweat on Heston's arms in the chariot race.

While the sound is still a bit harsh due mostly to old technology, I've found it to be more warmer sounding than before with plenty of boom.

Aside from the same extras you get on the DVD package, you also get a new HD documentary that focuses on Heston's experiences while filming Ben Hur complete with home movie footage behind the scenes. You also get a pictorial book and a reproduction of Heston's personal diary that's quite informative.",1215043200,,4382,4.752631578947368

1337211,5,B00003OSTA,"""Ben-Hur"" ranks amongst the true giants of cinema and for good reason.  The term epic can barely describe the feel of this film.  First of all, the acting is good and Heston did an excellent job as the title character.  I must say though that Jack Hawkin's relentless Roman Consul may have been the most memorable character.  This film just has so much; the nativity, a grueling galley scene, a naval battle, a Roman triumph, a spectacular chariot race, and Christ's crucifixion.  The chariot race has itself become the stuff of legend and must rank as one of the best stunt/action scenes ever put on film. Christ's passion is well done as well with the healing of Ben-Hur's mother and sister.  Personally, I thought the book did a better job at those though the film's chariot race likely surpasses that in the book.  The film has a number of historical errors, but they don't detract from its artistic merit.  There is some violence so parents may want to be cautious about very young children seeing the movie.  Overall, I heartily recommend this film.",1214352000,,1055,4.721311475409836

1337214,5,B00003OSTA,"I first saw the 1925 Ramon Navarro version of Ben Hur in the theatre ... and no, I'm not that old. Thames Television in London had commissioned composer/conductor Carl Davis to write a new score for this silent film which would do it justice. The original score for full symphony orchestra (silent films were rarely one woman and a piano, despite the myth) had disappeared, and the performance I witnessed in Glasgow used the full 120 players of The Royal Scottish National Orchestra. It included the separation of tympanists to different parts of the auditorium for the galley scenes, and was an extraordinary experience. My wife had played viola on his original recording of this score, and had enthused about it. She wasn't wrong! The music you hear in the DVD in this collection is Carl Davis's.

The 1920s version of Ben Hur is on a much larger scale than the 1950 one. The 1950s version re-used the small portion of the chariot race sets from the original which had survived, and glass shots for the rest (hence, so many enforced close ups). See the whole amphitheatre in its original glory in the 1925 version. Everything else about this version was on a much bigger scale, too. For example, while the pirate battle in the 1950s version uses models and miniatures with close up scenes shot in the studio using blue screen, the 1925 version used a real full sized fleet and was entirely shot on location in the Adriatic. Everything you see (including the sinkings) was real. The two fleets built for this film are still reckoned the most accurate recreations of Roman and Carthaginian ships made since the end of the Roman Empire, and the combined fleets created the biggest assemblage of such vesssels in modern times. To add spice to the action, the Italian extras hired to play both Romans and pirates came from the ranks of Mussolini's Fascists and the rival Communists. Naturally,the Fascists insisted in playing Romans. The Communists chose to be pirates. As a result, when the director called 'action' both sides went for each other with a vengeance. Watch every skirmish in this film. All of it is real. As the ships sank thousands found themselves in the sea. Each extra had signed a document confirming he could swim. In practise, very few could. A lot of political scores were settled during that week of shooting on the water. Bashing out the brains of the opposition seemed somehow more important than the very real prospect of drowning.

On a history of cinema note too, observe the changes between colour, tint and monochrome on screen. This wasn't down to saving costs. Although it looks odd to us today, it was seen at the time as a legitimate way of literally 'shading' the values and meaning of different scenes. Watch the film, taking note which scenes are coloured in which way, and the structure will become clear.

Also, note the topless dancers and similarly skimpily clad women. Prior to the 1930s, American cinema was much less concerned with prurient moralising, and much more with exploring the power of the medium. This film is a great tribute to this 'no holds barred' ethos, and one of the finest and most ambitious creations of American cinema.

The makers of this box set are to be congratulated in including it with the 1950s version. Although, on purely artistic terms, the 1950s version, though very good, should be included as an extra with the much, much better 1920s original.",1212796800,,3421,4.793220338983051

1337254,5,B00003OSTA,"The first film version of Ben-Hur was a 15-minute unauthorized version in 1907. This lead to a law suit by author Lew Wallace that set the precedent for future book-to-movie copyright cases. Eventually, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights, and produced the first legitimate adaptation in 1925. It was silent, 35 mm black-and-white (1.33:1 ratio) with some tinting and a few 2-strip Technicolor scenes. Fred Niblo directed Ramon Novarro as Ben-Hur, Francis X. Bushman as Messala and May McAvoy as Esther in an outstanding production. But it was plagued with many problems, including a sea battle shot in Italy, in which one of the ships actually caught fire, sending the extras into the sea, some of which may have drowned. In the famous chariot race, which was shot in LA, there was a big pile-up of chariots that injured numerous drivers and killed quite a few horses. All of these scenes were left in the final cut.

In 1959, William Wyler directed a second Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production of the book, this time with sound, in 65 mm Panavision (2.76:1 ratio) and in Technicolor. MGM was on the verge of bankruptcy; so, in one bold move, they invested everything they had in the film - and it paid off, making top box office for that year. Charlton Heston, who had worked with Wyler in The Big Country the previous year, played the title role and won an Oscar for it. Stephen Boyd, who would again drive a chariot in The Fall Of The Roman Empire (1965), played Messala. Haya Harareet, the only native Palestinian in the cast, played Esther. All the Romans were played by British actors, including Jack Hawkins,as Quintus Arrius. Hugh Griffith won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the wonderful Sheik Ilderim, owner of the four white Arabians that pull Ben-Hur's chariot.

There were 11 Oscars won in all - still the most ever, sharing honors with Titanic (1997) and The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003). The other Oscars won by Ben-Hur were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography for a Color Film, Best Art Direction-Set Direction for a Color Film, Best Costume Design for a Color Film, Best Effects-Special Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music-Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and Best Sound. The only one it was nominated for that it didn't win was Best Writing-Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.

I found the novel by Lew Wallace to be more charming and less ""big"" than the 1959 film. Even the characters were more life-size. I pictured a Robert Taylor in the role of Ben-Hur rather than Charlton Heston. The only actor from the film that seemed to fit the novel was Finlay Currie as Balthasar, the wise man from Egypt. He was perfect. Currie also narrates the film.

There is far more focus on Christ in the novel, the 1900 stage play (in which he is played by a beam of light) and the 1925 film than in the 1959 version. The book wrestles with the question of whether He will be an earthly King or a Savior of souls. Ben-Hur, who is a Sadducee, hopes he will be an earthly King, and actually trains three legions of Galileeans in preparation to help Him overthrow the occupying Romans. But Balthasar is convinced Christ will be a Savior of souls, and tries to convince Ben-Hur of the same. It is not until the miraculous events at the end that he accepts that fact, and accepts Christ as his Savior.

To date, Ben-Hur is still the greatest Christian novel ever written, and the greatest Christian film ever produced, as well as one of the all-time great classics. I don't agree with the AFI ranking of Ben-Hur at #100. I believe it, and the silent version, should share a position in the top 40 at least. There will never be another Ben-Hur, the 2003 animated version notwithstanding. It has been estimated that to reproduce Ben-Hur as it was produced in 1959, it would cost over a quarter of a billion dollars. That just isn't going to happen. And CGI won't cut it. You can't reproduce a live chariot race like the one in Ben-Hur in CGI and catch anyone's breath. So, this is a classic that will live as long as films are made. And, in my opinion, beyond that.

1337255,5,B00003OSTA,"In 1880, a retired Union General by the name of Lew Wallace completed his first historical novel while serving as governor in the Territory of New Mexico. He wrote it in response to questions raised by a famous agnostic sharing a train ride from Chicago to Indianapolis. At the time, Wallace wasn't as knowledgeable of the facts surrounding the life of Christ as he had thought. After doing extensive research, he was inspired to write what has become the definitive religious epic. Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ helped Wallace sort out his own beliefs about God and Christ, and inspired others to do the same. Today, it stands as the most widely read novel of the 19th Century, and one of the most popular works of all time. It has never been out of print in its 130 year history, and has been made into several plays and four films.

Ben-Hur reflects the life and journey of Lew Wallace. At the Battle of Shiloah, through an accident, he and his men arrived too late to help, making the Union losses significantly higher than they would have been. As a result, Wallace was disgraced. Judah Ben-Hur, through the accident of a loose roof tile, loses his home and property, his family is sent to prison, and he is sent to the galleys. Through a miracle of courage and circumstances, Wallace worked his way back, became a successful statesman and author, and is today remembered in the Hall of Statues in Washington, DC. Through a similar miracle, Ben-Hur works his way back to save his family and get revenge over those who caused their calamity. Ben-Hur is a story of courage and revenge, but it is also a story of redemption and salvation. I believe Wallace saw his life the same. Ben-Hur crosses paths with Christ more than once, so that, in the end, his hate and destructiveness are swallowed up in Christ's love and forgiveness. I believe Wallace saw the same miracle in his life.

Ben-Hur did not take off immediately; but, after several years of word-of-mouth, everyone was reading it, especially pastors and their congregations. In 1900, two producers, Klaw and Erlanger, bought the rights to bring Ben-Hur to the New York stage. It was an amazing production that boasted five teams of horses and chariots on stage at once for the great chariot race. They used treadmills for the teams, with moving scenery. There was also a great sea battle that was considered spectacular. The success of the play inspired showmen in the fledgling industry of motion pictures to take note.

The first film version of Ben-Hur was a 15-minute pirated version in 1907. This lead to a law suit by Wallace that set the precedent for future book-to-movie copyright cases. Eventually, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights, and produced the first legitimate adaptation in 1925, directed by Fred Niblo and starring Ramon Novarro. In 1959, William Wyler directed a second MGM production of the book, this time starring Charlton Heston. It won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Director.

I found the novel by Lew Wallace to be more charming and less ""big"" than the 1959 film. Even the characters were more life-size. I pictured a Robert Taylor in the role of Ben-Hur rather than Charlton Heston. The only actor from the film that seemed to fit the novel was Finlay Currie as Balthasar, the wise man from Egypt. He was perfect. The entire first of eight books, into which Ben-Hur is divided, is occupied by the three wise men, of which only Balthasar is carried through to the rest of the book, and plays a significant role. In addition to playing Balthasar, Currie also narrates the film.

There is far more focus on Christ in the novel, the 1900 stage play (in which he is played by a beam of light) and the 1925 film than in the 1959 version. The book wrestles with the question of whether He will be an earthly King or a Savior of souls.

But Balthasar is convinced Christ will be a Savior of souls, and tries to convince Ben-Hur of the same. It is not until the miraculous events of the last of the eight books that he accepts that fact, and accepts Christ as his Savior.

To date, Ben-Hur is still the greatest Christian novel ever written, as well as one of the all-time great classics. Men still struggle with the question of whether Christ is an earthly King or a Savior of souls. To find out, we  must all take similar journeys to Ben-Hur and Balthasar, and be hindered along the way by various Messalas. Not many of us will be like Balthasar and ""get"" it so quickly. Most of us will be more like Ben-Hur: accept what life throws at us with defiance, deal with it as best we can, struggle, realize we can't do it on our own, accept God's salvation, transcend our troubles through faith, and be transformed into someone new, someone Christ-like. Ben-Hur isn't just about Lew Wallace's journey from failure to freedom; like Pilgrim's Progress, it reflects the common journey all Christians must take.

This particular movie is actually an epic of a greatest magnitude, whether one thinks of the chariot race or one of the other many scene's that will forever be imbedded in one's mind.  This particular movie is sure to please audiences for generations to come.

My particular favorite of scenes was Mr. Heston as Judah Ben-Hur, as a slave who had to cross a desert into Nazareth and with the rest of the slaves dying of thirst.  The Romans felt they and their horses should drink first, before any of the slaves.  As for Judah, he was to receive no water at all.  In his suffering, he lies down upon the ground asking God to help him and Jesus comes with water just for him and brushes the head of Judah, to give him comfort.

When a Roman soldier comes towards Jesus to hit him with a whip, Jesus get's up and looks at the soldier and he could not hit him after looking into his face.  As for Judah, before he was forced to march again with the rest of the slaves, he had gotten his fill of water.

Scenes like that, is what makes a good movie for all audiences.",1207785600,,1301,4.295081967213115

The film itself was OK, though the plot (as I said) tends to wander around, and the conversion of faith that Ben-Hur experiences at the end is not handled well. When I was in high school, I took a class on writing, and the one thing that has stuck with me from that class is how a story should show, and not tell, of the inner workings of the characters. Ben-Hur doesn't come off at the end so well, because it tells us of the conversion in faith, rather than showing Ben-Hur work through his internal conflicts, and thus convert through epiphany.

1337314,5,B00003OSTA,"The  film that has become a by-word for the genre and the biggest of the roadshow movies of the fifties and sixties, 1959's Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ is from an audience point-of-view still a great movie, and considerably more intelligent than many modern critics would like to believe.

The best of the redemption epics of the Fifties, where suffering in the likes of The Robe or Quo Vadis  makes  their protagonists better in the creepily smug way that passes for movie righteousness, it turns its hero, Judah Ben-Hur, into a right s**t. Corrupted by revenge, he rejects Christ and turns away from passive resistance. Mistaken for Christ, he is himself betrayed by a friend and returns from his certain death (in this case the galleys) ""like a returning faith,"" in the words of one of his faithful servants, but he has no faith himself. Having initially rejected Messala's overtures to ""look to the west, look to Rome"", indirectly the cause of his misfortunes, he becomes Romanised and a mirror image of his betrayer. The character exists in a constant state of flux and torment, journeying from slave-owning Jew to Roman slave to Roman citizen to symbol of resistance, never regaining his peace until the finale.

There was never an actor more at home in the genre than Heston, and he is in strong form here, although much of his thunder is stolen by Stephen Boyd as Messala (the role Heston was pencilled in for before Rock Hudson turned down the lead) whose intelligent portrayal of ambition is far more Oscar-worthy than Hugh Griffiths' hammily enjoyable Sheik Ilderim. Jack Hawkins and the remainder of the cast perfectly judge their roles, with Wyler's adept direction achieving a perfect balance between the religious, political and human elements of the story.

While making the most of the spectacle, he also ensures that it is often the quieter moments that most impress. An assistant director on the 1926 version's chariot race sequence, his sensitivity with actors ensures the film is driven more by emotions than events, and certainly the scenes dealing with his return to Judea are often genuinely moving without seeming so overtly manipulative as they doubtless would have in other hands.

Miklos Rozsa's score is one of the greatest ever written for any motion picture and is remarkably sensitive to the needs of the film (although Wyler did reputedly want to use Silent Night for the Nativity sequence!). The stunning ten-minute chariot race, played in real-time, has and needs no music, relying instead on the infinitely more effective roar of the crowd and thunder of hooves. The sequence also shows canny production design: the arena is suitably high-walled to limit the number of extras needed for the three-month shoot of the scene.

Ben-Hur is a film which still somewhat defies television in all its formats - the cinema is really the place to see this, the bigger the screen, the better. At an extra-wide 2.76:1 widescreen, it's not quite SuperTohoScope, but it's close, but the lack of picture area that was a major problem with definition and colour balance in the old letterboxed video releases is no problem for the DVD transfer, though it's still not recommended viewing on a small-screen TV. The film is not paced for TV but for the giant screen, inevitably draining some of its effect. Nonetheless, this is a great value-for-money special edition that may not be able to replicate the cinema experience, but does a good job of reminding you of it.

Shot under huge pressure - MGM made it clear that the future of the studio depended on the picture - the resulting stress contributed to producer Sam Zimbalist's fatal heart attack before the film was completed, and the tortuous route to the screen is well documented in this four disc set through documentaries and even screen tests for Haya Hayareet, Cesare Danova and Leslie Nielson! Even the popular stage production, which ran throughout the US for a decade grossing an astonishing $10m. In case you're wondering, diagrams are provided of how the chariot race was staged with real horses and carts!

Sadly, although extracts from the notorious unauthorised one-reel 1911 Kalem version are included on the 50-minute documentary about the making of the film, the full short - shot during a beach party, with the camera never straying from the finish line during the chariot race - is not included. The make-or-break MGM 1925 silent version is, in the Thames Silents version lovingly restored by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, and makes an interesting comparison. An even more famously chaotic production than the remake that saw several actors die during the sea battle and dozens of horses put down in the chariot race, it takes a very different approach to the story for much of its running time. Never is that more apparent than in the end, which sees Judah Ben-Hur raising an army and marching on Jerusalem to save Christ from the cross!

There's also a selection of original and widescreen trailers on the DVD are splendid examples of the classic Hollywood selling technique, hyping the film in several languages.",1197763200,,5108,4.941724941724941
1337315,5,B00003OSTA,"General Lew Wallace deserves his own movie, so interesting was his life, and so great was his achievement with this mammoth novel.  What is so magnificent to me here is that Ben Hur is about Jews as well as Christians.  It's a story of Christ that unites us, rather than divides us.  The hero is a Jew, and the novel is a story of a great Jewish family; and yet it is truly a story of Our Lord Jesus Christ and His entrance into history.  How many other great Christian novels can interest our Jewish brothers and sisters the way this one can?  Too much of our later Christian writing and films is marred by needless anti-Semitism.  Not this monumental book!  And don't believe that it is dated or unreadable.  It is worth the plunge, worth the patience, worth the experience of surrendering to Wallace and his immense gift as a storyteller and a poet.  There is so much in this story I can't begin to describe it.  ---- The great motion picture versions of the book are vital and transforming today as they were when they were created.  --- I hope the novel inspires Christian writers by its absence of bias against the Jewish people, the people who are Our Lord's people.  I recommend you buy the new paperback version, of course, but also treat yourself to some of the old venerable hard covers still available; and if you cannot read the book word for word, then move to those parts which draw you in and move on from them.  There are times when the writing can put you in a trance with its beauty and its pace.  Again, Lew Wallace deserves his own filmed biography. He was a remarkable man.  He made history with this book, putting it into the hands of millions of Americans who never read novels at all, and drawing people to Christ with his rich and unforgettable story.  He gave Jews and Christians alike a classic that is now an American legend.",1196553600,,1854,4.440828402366864
1337316,5,B00003OSTA,"There have been hundreds of reviews that have covered the plot of William Wyler's 1959 epic Ben-Hur. I will attempt to limite my review to the Four Disc Collector's Edition released by Warner Brothers Video.

The first two discs present the epic film. The transfer is excellent and the letterboxed widescreen do justice to the Camera 65 original negative. The print quality on this edition is flawless and the Dolby 5.1 mix is very responsive on a good home theatre system.

The film discs also contain a commentary by film historian and author T. Gene Hatcher with additional pre recorded comments by Charlton Heston. The commentary is well worth listening to with Hatcher going over the production process and Heston filling in anecdotes on the filming and on his relationship with Wyler and the cast. There is also a music only track which showcases Miklos Rozsa's Academy Award winning score.

The third disc contains the 1925 silent version of Ben-Hur directed by Fred Niblo. This version was one of the most seen films of its time. Far from being difficult to watch the film is excellently restored and features a new score by Carl Davis. This film is the equal to the 1959 version and in some ways I think that I may perfer it.

The fourth disc contains more standard bonus type features. There are two hour long featurettes on the production of the film: Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic from 1994 and Ben-Hur: The Epic That Changed Cinema from 2005. Both are excellent features and give some useful information on both the making of the film and its lasting influences on a new generation of filmmakers. There are also stills galleries, screen tests, news reels and trailers.

This is the definitive presentation of this classic film and is well worth the purchase price.",1194566400,,1778,4.7973856209150325
1337317,4,B00003OSTA,"BEN-HUR The Four-Disc Collector's Edition

It is an ignominious fate that the Original Ben-Hur by which I mean the 1925 silent version has appeared as a bonus feature on the William Wyler's Ben-Hur Four-Disc Collector's Edition.

The 1925 Ben-Hur was a huge success. To this day it is still the most successful silent picture ever made. The sensational chariot race as with the William Wyler re-make was at the heart of the movie. It was the first time a Cinema audience had seen such awe-inspiring images. Such as four stallions and a speeding chariot racing directly over the top of a Camera sunk in the Arena track. The first the time a Camera followed a team of horses in close-up and at full gallop. So many film techniques that we take for granted in Action Cinema today were first born in this silent epic and they would be remembered.

 William Wyler remembered them 34 years later.

William Wyler had been an assistant director on the 1925 Original. He had witnessed its staggering success and when the time came for a re-make he was just the man for the job. Maybe you balk at my use of the word re-make? But that is exactly what the William Wyler version was. The studio knew they had a product that worked and did not want to divert from that winning formula. If it ain't broke....!

The Arena built in Italy was a virtual replica of the one built in the silent version. They utilized the original construction drawings. They used some of the same moulds for various statues. They even had a complete chariot from the 1925 Original that had already proved itself on film. They had the original designs and drawings of virtually everything that had been constructed 34 years previously and they all worked.

On the Extras Disc there is a rather lame documentary called ""The Epic that Changed Cinema"" where filmmakers repetitively praise the 1959 re-make. A Production Designer expresses his amazement at the imagination it took to design the Arena specifically those gigantic statues at each end of it. Had he seen the Original 1925 Film he would have seen that the Arena and particularly the gigantic statues are all but the same.

None of this is touched upon in the two documentaries that are presented on the special features disc. Nothing is mentioned about the suppression of the Original Version by MGM in the run-up to the release of the William Wyler's Ben-Hur or it's eventual burial.

The 1925 Ben-Hur is a rather melodramatic and histrionic affair. Most of the performances are over the top and it has the feeling of recorded theatre rather than a movie but what lifts this film into the realms of a classic is simply the chariot race. It is as good as the William Wyler version if not better. It has more chariots!

It is a shame that the Silent Original does not have any bonus features. A documentary by Kevin Brownlow could have solved this shameful emission, as the man is responsible for it's restoration and survival. He is also one of the best documentary filmmakers out there. Just watch his Thames Television series called ""Hollywood"" about America's early film pioneers or ""Unknown Chaplin"" and you will see what I mean.

As for the William Wyler's re-make the same seems to apply. The chariot race is the highlight of the film. The race is remarkably similar in structure, blocking and interpretation as that of the Original. Most of the shots and camera positions are an exactly the same.

The rest of William Wyler's epic never really elevates above pure melodrama. The exceptional performance by Hugh Griffith lends the film a much-needed sense of intrigue but generally the film plays by the numbers. The weak latter half of the film almost feels as if you are watching Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"". The film uses all of the technologies available at the time to best effect. It is beautifully shot in Camera 65 by Robert L. Surtees. It has incredible matt paintings. The production design is romantic yet faultless. The Hollywoodised costumes are beautiful.

Gore Vidal is acknowledged to have written the first half of the film up until the chariot race. He is disgracefully not even credited. These early scenes are far superior to the latter plodding religious pontificating. In the first scenes between Ben-Hur and Messala, he has cleverly interwoven a homosexual love affair gone terribly wrong. It explains clearly Messala's brutal reaction. He also has a poke at the waning Un-American Committee by having Messala demand that Ben-Hur name names.

The problem with the films as a whole is the source material that they are based on. The Novel is melodramatic, shallow and episodic. Even the title is incorrect ""A Story of the Christ"". It might be the most read book other than the bible but it does not mean that it is any good. It is simply a compelling adventure yarn with Christ thrown in and as with the films the best part is the chariot race.",1188950400,,4896,4.751472320376914
1337318,4,B00003OSTA,"I recently finished reading ""Ben-Hur"" and I must comment that I'm glad I took the time to read it.  The only reason I gave the work four stars instead of five is because Wallace's vivid details make the book somewhat tedious at times.  The plot is very well conceived and Wallace created some memorable characters although I felt the characterization was not quite as good as in another famous nineteenth century Roman Epic ""Quo Vadis"".  The way in which Wallace weaved the story together with the life of Christ and the political situation in Judea was effective.  Despite being famous for the chariot race in Antioch, I believe the most powerful scenes were involving Ben-Hur's leprous mother and sister as well as Christ's crucifixtion.  The ending is generally positive though somewhat of a cliff hanger if one thinks about it.  I recommend the 1959 movie version as well as the book.",1186790400,,888,4.847682119205298
1337319,5,B00003OSTA,"'Ben-Hur' is such a great film, it's a pleasure to report that the newly restored Wide Screen 4-Disc DVD version (which includes the 1925 silent screen film with Ramon Novarro) is right on the mark. The color has been restored to its original brilliance with every scene clearly in focus and the soundtrack gives full range to Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. More than ever, Rozsa's score seems to have an energy and force of its own, underlining all the drama inherent in a story of this kind. And Charlton Heston's work in the title role is sheer perfection. He captures the character so completely that he IS Ben-Hur.

Not often does such an epic have human characters that are not dwarfed by all the spectacle. The characters are all fully-dimensional human beings--particularly the two antagonists (Judah Ben-Hur and Messala), once great friends but now divided by political loyalties. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are outstanding in the leads (Boyd should definitely have won an Oscar as Messala for his chilling death scene alone!).

All the other important roles are flawlessly cast. The chariot race is the most explosive and breathtaking seventeen minutes ever given to such a spectacular event--and all of the stunts look perfectly real. It's hard to believe that none of the stunts ended with more than minor injuries.

The final scene, which follows soon after the chariot race, with Ben-Hur returning home and slowly climbing the steps to find that his mother and sister have been cured, still gives me goose bumps when I see it. As does the poignant scene in the leper colony where he insists on seeing their cave dwelling. Both scenes are strongly bolstered by Miklos Rozsa's brilliant score.

Fully deserved all the awards it won. Should be released theatrically to show folks that even in 1959, Hollywood had all the technical skill to bring something like this off--with spectacular results! But in the meantime, this newly restored DVD is a keeper.",1185667200,,1973,4.9878419452887535

But similiar to the way the Harry Potter fans compare the movies to the books and see the many differences in the pair, the same is true for ""Ben Hur"". I'm not saying ""Ben Hur"" is a bad movie - it most certainly isn't and ""Ben Hur"" won 11 Oscars to prove it. But there is something different about reading the book.
The story is well known. Prince Judah Ben-Hur and Messala were childhood friends. Messala becomes extremely loayal to Rome and banishes Ben-Hur's family. Ben Hur is enslaved on a war ship. Somehow, he makes it back to Rome and decides to take revenge against Messala.
He changes and decides he wants to give up the sword. A simple story, told without the Hollywood spectacle, is extremely moving. You get to see the internal workings of the man as he struggles between revenge and redemption.  I recommend this book highly.",1185580800,,973,4.528409090909091

From the life of a prince to a galley slave our star Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is taken from his home in Israel and travels across the known world.  He is despised and beaten by some and praised and honored by others along this forced journey.  He meets everyone from Caesar to Jesus Christ along his path back to home where he must defeat his arch enemy and once best friend.

I recommend Ben Hur because movies like this are not produced anymore. In 1959 there were no computers to enhance the scenes and to help make many of the scenes easier to pull off.

They can serve as a reminder that not everything Hollywood put out was garbage, and that remakes can be better if they can improve on the original.  The 1925 version is spectacular enough, costing an unprecedented 4 million at the time, and while not as good as the 1959 version, it's worth seeing and it's one of the best examples of silent film.  The 1959 version is brilliant.  Despite the film being almost 4 hours, it is never boring, even after the chariot race (contrary to rumour, the film doesn't end with the chariot race).  The narrative arc of the story is so well done that it more than keeps your interest.  Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his excellent performance, and Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins are superlative as well.  The chariot race is amazing to watch.  It goes on for quite some time, and there is not one word of dialogue spoken throughout it.  Today, Heston and Boyd would be makin' snarky wisecracks at each other, and it would all be CGI.  Knowing that the chariots, horses, racetrack, and actors are all real, makes this sequence even more gripping.  Word to current filmmakers.  The 1959 version of Ben-Hur is why you should remake something.  First, the new version is in colour, it has sound, and it's shot in widescreen.  These are great improvements over the 1925 version.  There was a real valid reason to remake it (screw that ""reimagning"" rubbish), instead of a bald faced attempt to make money.  Cecil B. DeMille was originally scheduled to direct this, but died before any pre-production work started.  It was taken over by William Wyler, one of Hollywood's neglected directors.  This film was shot in 2.75:1, the widest aspect ratio ever used.  Only a handful of films were shot that way (The Greatest Story Ever Told was a notable one).

Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd performed exceptionally well. Heston (Judah ben-hur) a judean and Boyd (Messala) a high ranking roman soilder. They were childhood friends. They remained friends in their adult life even though they hadn't met since their youth..The conflict between these 2 started when the romans were taking control over Judea. Messala even invited Judah ben-hur to be part of the roman empire and to basically deny his own heritage .Ben Hur refused and would not go against his own people..This was the start of 2 characters becoming bitter enemies. Eventually after some more rival events messala being in power took out his revenge and jailed the entire Ben-Hur family. Judah Ben-Hur ,his mother and sister. Judah was sent into slavery on roman military ships as a chained rower. The mother and sister were sent into dark deaseased inflicted dungens. A big budget film. There is also a full length commentary , Charlton Heston speaks about the film in detail scene by scene. Heston said in the commentary MGM spent so much money making this movie that if the film was a flop there would be no MGM studio but a parking lot at that location instead. When I was watching this film I was amazed how in 1959 that a film of this caliber was made. Remember in 1959 there was no such of a thing as computer animation .Whatever the camera records on film was real with real people and surroundings. The movie is about 3 1/2 hours ,a long movie but every scene is a masterpiece. Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is  actually the full title .There are 2 stories which intertwine  .The tale revolves around two storylines: the story of Jesus and the story of Ben-Hur. The last scene is filled with so much meaning and spectacular to watch. Ben-Hur's mother and sister where inflicted with the desease of leprosy which they acquired while they were imprisoned innocently. This story takes place during the time of Jesus (30 AD).  The mother and sister heard of the name JESUS CHRIST knew Jesus was sent from GOD.They heard of stories of his miracles and his preaching. They seen him carrying the cross earlier and had hope and faith in Him. Jesus was on the cross; As he spoke His last words  ""Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing"" He bowed His head .The Skys opened up ,Lighting ,Thunder,Earth quakes was taking place ,Blood was dripping from His wounds and mixing with the rain water below.

I've seen Ben Hur a number of times. My opinion has not changed. It has two terrific action sequences, excellent acting by Charleton Heston and Jack Hawkins, and decent water imagery. Otherwise the film is only one of many overdone biblical epics, with ponderous sincerity, replete with stilted dialog, images, and plot.

Although the chariot race is one of the most famous of all film scenes, and is obviously a tour de force of accomplishment, I must admit I prefer the 1927 silent one which, to my mind, has more raw excitement and energy, although not the incredible virtuosity of this one.

However, the best sequence of the film, compromising several scenes, are those on the ship culminating with the triumphal presentation. Here Jack Hawkins adds immeasurably with his great acting, consistently delivering lines with cynicism amalgamated with insight. What a difference when he plays against Charleton Heston. His tone of cynicism, awareness, emphasis simply when saying '41', Heston's number as the rower in the ship, as in 'Your eyes are full of hate, forty-one', completely, and with power, illustrates the relative situations of the two men.

There are some striking compositions. One is the view of the steps leading up to Caesar when Hawkins returns triumphantly, another is Heston looking down into the ship's hold at the enslaved rowers after he has been freed. Another is Christ giving Heston water.

However, the women are uniformly terrible, and more importantly the script, particularly in the dialog when the women are involved, is cliched with the lines delivered in such an astoundingly stilted fashion that they do honor to stilts.

I've never particularly liked Wyler as a director, feeling his visual style (and therefore the film's basic stance) as boring, undercutting often excellent actors and good script. His compositions in many of the scenes, and all with the women and Heston are completely unimaginative, simply centering the character and leaving the rest of the wide screen completely devoid. Any director of imagination would find aesthetically interesting and significant ways of taking advantage of the wide screen, and not just in the epic action sequences.

The musical score by Miklos Rozsa is ponderous, boring, overdone, and grating, with screeching violins in the love scene. A better score would have added immeasurably.

In a way the film is a one time must see for anyone interested in film history, but it's still just worth three stars.",1168041600,,2565,5.134292565947242
1337387,5,B00003OSTA,"Director William Wyler's 1959 epic ""Ben-Hur"" is bar none of the finest movies ever made. Brimming with amazing performances, dazzling set pieces, and an incredibly well written storyline, ""Ben-Hur"" has stood the test of time to become a defining moment in cinema.

Most reviewers have gone over the plot in great detail, so I will skip over that. I will say that Charlton Heston, one of the legends of filmdom, has never been better than in his role as Judah Ben-Hur. Great actors like Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster and Rock Hudson were all offered a chance to play this character, and while all of them would've no doubt done a fine job, no one could possibly beat Heston in the part. He plays it an unforgettable and one a kind manner that's very difficult to put into words. The supporting cast is top notch, specifically Stephen Boyd, who as Messala creates an unforgettable amount of tension between him and Heston. Both Heston & Boyd received Oscars (this film won 11 out of 12 nominations), and deservedly so.

The directing by Wyler is incredible, especially the chariot race, which is one of a kind and one of the best scenes in the history of the movies. If made today, that sequence would've been entirely done in CGI, and while it would've looked cool no doubt, it wouldn't hold the same excitement, danger, substance and believability that it does with real actors.

I love that Jesus's face is never actually shown throughout the movie. It makes his presence in the movie all the more real and emotional. The crucifixion sequence at the end is heartwrenching to watch. The actor who played Jesus was an opera singer named Claude Heater (this was the only movie he ever did), and he's simply amazing.

What's so great about ""Ben-Hur"" is that despite the religious themes spread throughout the plot, you don't need to be religious at all to enjoy it (I myself am a Catholic who is firm in my belief in God). I know atheists who told me how great they thought ""Ben-Hur"" was. It goes to show just how great and how powerful this movie truly is.

The special features on this dvd are great (though I still need to update to the four disc edition), as is the sound and picture quality. This is a motion picture that truly belongs in everyone's dvd collection.",1165449600,,2265,4.624378109452737
1337388,5,B00003OSTA,"Despite a few weaknesses, this is a 5 star film, one of the most powerful epics ever, and far more spiritual than most.

Here are two corrections (re: matters of fact) to reviews in this thread:

The important one, so people won't be disappointed by expecting something that doesn't happen, is that there is no Resurrection in the 1959 Ben-Hur!  There is something else, but no Resurrection.

The minor one is that it is ""Down Eros, Up Mars!""  Not Aires, but Eros!  The Romans were anticipating sublimation, the suppression of Eros in the service of war.

A note on the Blu-ray.  Some of the marvelously loud moments in the original film seem to have been turned down ... an audio dynamic range compressor or limiter may have been in the line ... or a well meaning human compressor may have been at work.  There is a third possibility, but I truly hope that the mixers preparing the sound for such an important Blu-ray would not make such a mistake.  When going back to the original sound elements (music, sound effects, dialog, each on a dedicated, separate recording), there is the danger that the filmmakers' dynamic adjustments for the final master might not be included.  These final adjustments might have included turning up the sound as far as tolerable during the two moments I have in mind. Too bad. Yet another possibility is that a pre-mixed version of the sound, intended for a lower dynamic range medium (VHS, DVD, or general release re-issue for the boonies) may have been used and this pre-mix version failed to include the filmmaker's dramatic adjustments.  No matter; I finally found a way to make volume adjustments on my pre/pro without a read-out appearing on the screen. I will be turning those two (spoiler) moments up to match the 70 mm experience I had about 6 or more times.",1164240000,,1800,4.715654952076678

1337411,5,B00003OSTA,"`Ben-Hur' released in '59 is an inspirational tale of betrayal and revenge, love and endurance, forgiveness and redemption played out amidst the backdrop of the last years of Jesus Christ's earthly ministry.

Plot: Judah Ben-Hur (Charleton Heston), a wealthy Jew living in the Holy Land is falsely accused of crimes against Rome and sent off to spend the rest of his days as a slave on a Roman galley. His estate is confiscated, his Mother and sister thrown into prison. His accuser is a Roman officer named Messala (Stephen Boyd), Judah's best friend since childhood.

Judah survives the hardships of slavery, gains his freedom and eventually becomes the adopted son of a powerful and wealthy Roman Reagent. Providence certainly appears to be guiding Judah's path. However Judah's heart is filled with hate for Messala. He cannot forgive or forget what he and Rome has done to him and his family. He returns home in an attempt to restore what he has unjustly lost and avenge himself against his old friend.

Winner of 11 Academy Awards 'Ben-Hur' is truly an epic among epics. The massive backgrounds and sets will take your breath away, but the true beauty and strength of this film is found in the story it tells and the incredible cast that brings this story to life. The most memorable scenes in `Ben-Hur' are the intimate moments, the quiet conversations, the longing glances. My personal favorite moment is when Judah finds himself falling hopelessly in love with Esther (Haya Haraeet) one of his house slaves. While granting her freedom so she may be free to leave his service and marry, he places her slave ring on his own finger as a symbol of his undying love for her.

If you like movies like Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, or any sand and sword movies, chances are good that you will be able to enjoy this one. Keep in mind that this is not some kind of cheap thrills popcorn flick. This is a serious story for a more mature audience, not that it is inappropriate for kids (there's violence) but most people under the age of thirty just don't seem to have the patience to sit through a three hour movie and enjoy how the plot unfolds. The movie is long, but it spans a good enough length of time that it rarely feels as if it is dragging, and the plot twists and action make it great. Some people are turned off by Charlton Heston, because of his current views on gun control and such, but in this movie he is superb as a man who doesn't want violence and weaponry (ironic, isn't it.) This film won 11 Oscars for a reason, and as long as you have more than a 90-minute attention span, you should at least watch this once.",1150243200,,990,4.243386243386244
1337413,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur set the bar for period films of today, and although the graphics in this film fail in comparision there is yet to be a film of this magnitude that can hold a candle to it.  Ben-Hur is truly one of a kind and one that will never be repeated.  Telling the story of wealthy Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) as his political ideas clash with his old friend and now Roman official Messala (Stephen Boyd) and cost him his friendship and almost his life.  After their outing Messala uses anything he can to put Judah away, and when an accident almost costs the governer his life Messala finally has his excuse to send Judah to the gallows and throw his mother and sister in prison.  Judah vows to get his revenge, and much like Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator, Ben-Hur is given his chance in the most unique of circumstances.  This epic is the best of the best, and while others have come close (Gladiator coming the closest) there is still yet to come another Ben-Hur.  At 4 hours in length this may not be a one seating type film, but it's well worth the time is takes to watch it through.  With brilliant performances on all fronts, Ben-Hur stands alone as one of the most worthy films to ever grace the oscars and one of the best films to ever take top honors.

1337414,5,B00003OSTA,"I was reading some reviews of ""The Quiet Man"" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.

In that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.

For me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston's skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur's best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ's ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.

Heston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius.

I say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In ""Spartacus,"" also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.

At the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.

A great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1146096000,,2539,4.606194690265487
1337415,5,B00003OSTA,"I would like to reiterate the good reviews people have been giving the silent version of Ben Hur. Only a fraction of people who have seen the 1959 version have seen the 1925. Perhaps only a fraction of the people who buy this DVD will bother to check out the silent film.

Well, I must say I found it very moving. I am used to people saying that this or that silent film is ""excellent"" - well, this silent movie really is excellent. The power of the imagery is up there with Metropolis and Caligari as a truly hallucinatory cinematic experience. My favourite parts of the movie include the bright shining Star of Bethlehem appearing in the sky - the incredible naval battle which looks better than the later version - the chariot race, ditto - and seeing Antioch and Rome.

This silent movie is not only great for silent movie buffs - it may well be the ideal introduction to silent movies for modern people (along with Metropolis, though I think Ben Hur's storyline is much better).

Now, watching the 1925 version also confirms to me what a terrific script writer the later movie had. The more primitive revenge story of the 1925 version is terrific, but it lacks the personal touch of the 1959 version. Emphasising Messala's past with the Ben Hur family was a master stroke.

Also, you can see how the experience of the Holocaust affected movie making in the 1950s. The 1925 movie is full of melodrama; the 1959 movie is full of grit. The dungeons and the Valley of the Lepers begin to resemble Dachau and Belsen; the roman soldiers march with a fascistic arrogance not even dreamed of in the 1920s. Many in the postwar movie industry were expatriate Jews who had come out of an experience that put grit into the fantasy land of Hollywood.",1145750400,,1742,4.555910543130991

I have long enjoyed the movie Ben-Hur, so I decided to pick up the book, since I have always found novels to be far better than the movies that they inspire.  I was slightly worried after reading some reviews that made it sound like a dull history book.  After reading Ben-Hur, I was very pleasantly surprised.  It does contain historical information, and is rich with detail, but it is also action packed.  I found myself not wanting to put it down until I was finished.

1337417,5,B00003OSTA,"There is a growing and welcome trend in recent months among DVD releases of classic films. If the title is a remake of a silent film version then the original is now being included along with the remake. Of course it's the remake that gets all the headlines but that is as it should be since most people aren't silent film enthusiasts. I was originally opposed to this idea on economic grounds as multidisc sets are expensive but then it occured to me that without the remake we wouldn't get to see the original at all and this way people can be exposed to the silent versions and hopefully learn to judge them on their own merits. Already we have the 1921 CAMILLE coupled with the 1936 Garbo version and the 1925 WIZARD OF OZ (plus other silent Oz films) newly restored with the classic 1939 version.

Now comes the celebrated 1925 version of BEN-HUR accompanying the even more celebrated 1959 William Wyler/Charlton Heston film on a 4 disc set and later this month the 1923 version Of Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS will be issued along with a restored version of the 1956 film for its 50th anniversary. As a silent film enthusiast I will comment on the 1925 film as very little has been said about it compared to all that has been said about the much better known 1959 movie. BEN-HUR was once regarded as one of the magnificent follies of the silent era. It took years to make and cost M-G-M around $4,000,000 (approximately half a billion in today's currency). although what they lost in money was more than gained in prestige. The film made M-G-M THE studio in Hollywood, a position they would not relinquish for 30 years. It made a star out of Ramon Novarro and gave Francis X. Bushman the role of his career as Messala. It featured Technicolor sequences (lovingly restored in this presentation), mammoth sets as well as the expected cast of thousands and has the original version of the chariot race which remains just as exciting today as back in 1925. The sea battle between the Pirates and the Roman galleys is even more exciting as it was shot in Italy with real ships and not miniatures.

The one thing that really stands out about this version is how powerful its condemnation of anti-semitism is. The Christian aspects of the story are still there of course but they are on an equal footing with the plight of what it means to be Jewish in a hostile world. The orchestral score by Carl Davis is outstanding and really helps to elevate this into one of the best silent film viewing experiences especially for people unfamiliar with silent films.

I first saw Ben Hur at the movies when I was about 10 years old (yes... now you know I'm closer to Attends then Pampers) and revisited it several years after, in the VHS decades and again in the early and late DVD period (yes I do like the movie).

This newly re-mastered version in anamorphic widescreen is absolutely incredible to view (they had to have spent a fortune re-doing this one) as well as listen to, with the addition of enhanced (not overdone) 5.1 surround sound (from six track stereo --- back in 1959).

Enough has been said about how great the story and movie is, and I couldn't agree more, even though I don't have any particular bent for biblical epics.  This movie is a classic, in the true sense of the word, and it takes on a new dimension with this particular DVD release.

In reading reviews it is often helpful, I think, to get a sense of  the author's realm of experience and what other movies or types of  DVD's he or she likes, just to see if there is a correlation of tastes, and so, I offer some of my favorites, in no particular order or type, Saving Private Ryan,  Titanic,  Eagles (Hell Freezes Over), Sting (the Brand New Day Tour),  Inherit the Wind NOT Gone with the Wind (Spencer Tracy and the Scopes monkey trial), Gladiator, Master and Commander, Amadeus, War of the Worlds the Cruise vs...etc.

I picked up the 'Focus on the Family' publication of Ben Hur as I was exiting our library. I did not know I had just picked up the novel of my life. This book is suplative in every way-wonderful plot, incredible characterizations, historically accurate, and even life changing. General Lew Wallace wrote this incredible work in 1880, and I don't believe this novel could be written by today's writers. There are some of the most perfectly written sentences I have ever read, every line comparable to fine wine that must be sipped slowly for best effect rather than gulped like present-day works. It took me a full month of pleasure to finish this fine work. It can be enjoyed by Christian and non-Christian alike, and will cause those who believe to believe even stronger, while those unfamiliar or doubtful of the Good News of Christ will be quickened spiritually. This book is gigantic in scope and life changing in effect. By the way, I've never seen the movie, but I'm going to check it tonight",1134432000,,1089,4.767195767195767
1337431,4,B00003OSTA,"At the age of 53, Lew Wallace, a veteran of the Civil War as well as the diplomatic corps, found himself a bestselling author. Like most cultured men of his generation, I'm sure he had absorbed and admired the works of Sir Walter Scott, an admiration that is quite obvious in Wallace's ambitious historical novel ""Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ"". Set, as the title suggests, during the period of Christ's life, the novel opens with the quest of the Wise Men and concludes with the Crucifixion. But because it is a work of fiction, the central character, in fact the title character, is the fictional Judah Ben Hur, the scion of a wealthy Jewish family living in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. Because of an unusually ill-timed accident, Judah's house is confiscated by Tiberius, his sister and widowed mother thrown into prison, and Judah himself sent to slave in the galleys, a punishment which had a brief life expectancy, even for a healthy young man. Surviving the galleys through an unusual set of circumstances, Judah is adopted by a Roman duumvir (magistrate) and trained in a Roman military school. Afterwards, he travels to Antioch where he participates in a chariot race, primarily so that he can challenge his childhood friend-turned-enemy Massala, often referred to as the Massala. (The chariot race section of the novel was often published separately.) All this action, though described in dense Sir Walterish detail, moves swiftly and smoothly, the plot continually acceptable and absorbing. Because this is a work of the American Victorian school(you'll find yourself addressed as ""dear reader""), the tone is frequently a little nave. When Judah visits Antioch's Grove of Daphne he is as shocked by its ""love without law"" as David Copperfield would have been. And Iras, the femme fatale of the story, betrays her wickedness by telling Judah a somewhat salacious version of the Creation. The last third of the novel is taken up with Christ's mission and the antagonism it arouses in Judea. Interestingly, Judah misunderstands the concept of King of the Jews and thinks of Jesus as a messianic Alexander, ready to wipe Rome off the map. Because he has such (worldly) faith in the warrior, he himself forms a guerilla force to support Jesus, and he is surprised to say the least when he is confronted with the reality. (In keeping with 19th Century kitsch, Jesus is depicted as slender, with flowing auburn hair and a gentle face.) The final chapters are variations on familiar scenes from the New Testament, but they are well-written and lead strongly to the novel's climax. The year 2005 is the centenary of Lew Wallace's death, and what better way to acknowledge him than by reading this, the book for which he is best remembered.",1134086400,,2739,4.943600867678959
1337432,5,B00003OSTA,"William Wyler's Oscar-winning BEN-HUR (1959), produced by Sam Zimbalist (who died of a heart attack near the end of filming) and based on a best-selling late 19th Century novel by Lew Wallace, is one hell of a movie experience.  Watching a brand-new, pristine camera negative copy, I could not believe that the opening Nativity scene and the Resurrection finale were the same movie.  There is just so much here.  This remake of the 1925 silent epic, runs 3 hours and 45 minutes, including powerful roadshow bookend music by Miklos Rozsa.  It takes its leisurely time in telling the story of a Jew (Charlton Heston) and a Roman (Stephen Boyd), raised as best friends, who become bitter enemies in the Holy Land of Jesus Christ's life.  Director Wyler was always known as a painstaking perfectionist who would exhaust cast and crew by doing take after take after take of every scene.  But the result for the audience is enthralling.

Wyler had never made a Biblical epic before and wanted to work in every genre; his BEN-HUR is the one with a literate brain.  It is hard to believe it had major writing problems, multiple writers, and scenes written the night before they would be filmed.  It flows beautifully and is continually engrossing, despite its near four hour length.  The cast is impeccable, including Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Jack Hawkins, lovely Haya Harareet, and Oscar winner Hugh Griffith.

If you are looking for the sea battle (directed by Andrew Marton), it is about 70 minutes into part one.  If you are seeking out the greatest chariot race in movie history (choreographed and directed by Yakima Canutt), it is about ten minutes after the intermission.  The Christ scenes are handled with taste and subtlety; we see only his back or his hand and never hear his voice.  In fact, non-Christians might have a difficult time understanding what is going on in those scenes with Jesus, including an impressive Sermon on the Mount near the movie's end.  The art direction and costumes are absolutely gorgeous, and Robert Surtees' use of ultra wide-screen Camera 65 is masterful.  Most of all, Miklos Rozsa contributes the music score of a lifetime.  Everyone won Oscars for their distinguished work.  No wonder this BEN-HUR won eleven Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.  It is a masterpiece.  The audio commentary, by scholar and author Gene Hatcher and Mr. Heston, is thoughtful and insightful.

The 1925 silent version, starring Ramon Novarro as Ben-Hur and Francis X. Bushman as Messala, is on disk three of the new and magnificent  four disk set.  In some ways it is even more impressive than the remake.  Novarro and Bushman give performances of a lifetime, the 143 minute length is a good 75 minutes shorter than the 1959 version, the color tinting is very beautiful, the sea battle and chariot race are sensationally good by any standards, and the silent version has far more Jesus Christ scenes and in two-color Technicolor.  Carl Davis' orchestra score is outstanding, as always.

The disk four bonuses include two major documentaries, one for the 1994 tape version and one brand-new for this 2005 DVD restoration.  We also get ""BEN-HUR: A JOURNEY THROUGH PICTURES"", several 1959 movie theatrical trailers, and a gallery of vintage newsreels heralding the arrival and covering the premiere of the lavish remake in 1959.  This $40 DVD set is a work of art and deserves a place in every library, even if it takes you a while to see all four disks of material.  Amazon.com has it for $30, not much more than the cost of a family of four going out to a new movie at night.  With both the 1925 and 1959 versions included in flawless prints, this DVD set gets my highest recommendation.",1133654400,,3758,4.8265625
1337433,5,B00003OSTA,Even on the small screen it works very effectively. It is so exciting and riveting the true film highlight. But the rest of the film is excellent too.,1132358400,,150,4.392857142857143
1337434,4,B00003OSTA,"There are many things to like about BEN HUR.  I agree with other reviewers when they say that it is, by far, the best biblical epic of its time.  The story of Judah Ben Hur is an engaging one and it has been duplicated in several films since: one can see the influence it has had on films such as GLADIATOR, SPARTACUS, and even the Sondheim musical SWEENEY TODD.  It is the tale of a man betrayed by his friend, banished from his homeland, only to return a prince.

Despite its deserved accomplishments, I was not completely enthralled with BEN HUR.  For one thing, it is too long.  Now, I am not against watching a four hour movie (in principle).  But I am against redundancy and unnecessary length.  After watching BEN HUR for an hour, I felt as if the plot had only advanced fifteen minutes or so.  It is a testament to the film that it manages to stay engaging throughout most of its length.  But regardless of its interest, I found that several of the scenes could have been drastically shortened.  For example, there is a terribly long scene in which the ship (Ben Hur is imprisoned as a rower) is forced to ""go through the paces"" so that the commander can test the mettle of Hur and his companions.  The scene takes several minutes as the commander slowly increases the pace of the rowing.  On the one hand, watching the entire scene allows you to see the full measure of the men, but the same point could have been communicated in a single minute.

Secondly, I also felt that the ""Christ"" story is tacked on.  Of course, the role of Jesus in Ben Hur's life is important because Jesus gives him water (and with it hope) and because it is Jesus' Passion that finally allows Ben Hur to put his hatred behind him and seek life instead of death.  Yet, despite this importance, the film drags on in its final hour.  After the breathtaking chariot sequence, the film should (for all intensive purposes) be over.  But, instead, it drags on for about an hour and the film decides to narrate much of the Passion sequence (something that could have been its own movie).  Once again, I feel that Ben Hur's redemption could have been communicated in a much more efficient manner, instead of reconstructing a forty five minute ""Christ"" sequence.

But let us not focus on the bad.  I mentioned the ""chariot"" sequence before and everyone else does as well.  All I can say is: there's a reason.  The chariot sequence was magnificent.  I was shocked.  I would not be hesitant to say that it is one of the best action sequences that has ever been caught on camera.  There is not a single dull moment in its seven-odd-minutes of glory.  The task of filming it must have been monumental, but the payoff is well worth it.  It is, by far, the climax of the entire movie.

In conclusion, it's BEN HUR, folks.  You have to see it at least once, if for no other reason than to say you have.  Of all the biblical epics, I would endorse this one the most.  Try it out.  The sheer scale of the film alone will impress you.",1131494400,,3001,4.408014571948998

1337437,5,B00003OSTA,"When I first saw ""Hur"" at a movie theater when I was a young, rambunctious college student the flick was cut down by an hour and I was, ahm, under the influence of a controlled plant.  I recall not liking the film very much: the acting seemed hammy and the hiarcuts to 1950s.

Since then, however, I have grown older, and laughing tobacco is a distant memory.  I've also seen ""Ben Hur"" in its complete glory, and must say I like it a lot better.  The haircuts seem fine, the acting is excellent throughout.  And the production values, well, they haven't aged a bit.

The Collector's Edition has the '59 widescreen version in pristine condition, the '25 version, clips from the '07 version, two lengthy documentaries about the making of the '59 version and the whole history of ""Hur"" from the Lew Wallcace novel -- written in the 1880s -- through the monumental stage production and the monumental '25 film. There are newsreels, clips from the 1960 Acadmy Ward ceremony, trailers, and screen tests.

* Interesting points:  The MGM version from the '20s cost $4 million (although this seems high to me), and the '59 incarnation cost $15 million.  Both of these figures would make the productions record-breakers in terms of costs for their time periods. *

The chariot race is the action high point in both films (duh), but what I find interesting is that filming accidents during both races end up on screen and serve to heighten the race.  In '59, it was Joe Canuck flipping out of Heston's chariot when it jumps over the wreckage; in '25, it was a massive crash of chariots on a turn.  The pile up of horses and vehicles goes on and on, you can see an A.D. trying to wave drivers off (to no avail) but in both accidents the footage was just to good NOT to use.

All in all a good package, if you're in the mood.",1129334400,,1812,4.487804878048781
1337438,4,B00003OSTA,"This was one of the great spectaculars of its time.  It is long; 2 hours and 20 minutes, and like all silent movies, you must pay attention every minute, but it is fun to watch.  The chariot race is very well done, with overhead shots and a camara mounted on an axel.  There is a bad pile up near the end of the race that may or may not have been in the script.  Chariot racing is very dangerous and in those days, there was not much concern for animal welfare on  movie sets.

The costumes are really dreadful.  Ramon Novarro, (Ben Hur) looks like a ballet dancer in skimpy tunics that barely cover the essentials.  His armour is chain mail and a pointy helmet (very popular about 11 centuries later)  The Egyptian harlot who tries to tempt Ben Hur the night before the race wears a bizarre headress not found on any Egyptian wall painting or bas relief.  Francis X Bushman (Masala) has a winged helmet that makes him look like the Mecury Messenger.

But for all that, one set property is right on.  There are a lot of cavalry scenes and the horses always have saddles with no stirrups.  Novarro is obliged to vault onto his horse in dashing array, just as it was done 2000 years ago. This is one area where most movies about the ancient world fail - the saddles usually have stirrups, which is incorrect.  They did not come into regular use until the 5th century or so, although why such a common sense idea took so long is another question.

If you have access to Ben Hur I  as part of the recently released Ben Hur four disk set, check it out before going to the feature attraction.  This movie is good enough to stand on its own and shouldn't be considered a practice run for the 1959 version.  Still, it is easy to see where William Wyler got some of his material.",1129248000,,1770,4.3121212121212125
1337439,5,B00003OSTA,"Firstly i would like to apologize for my spelling, I know it is bad and I don't have a dictionary with me.  My review is, more or less, based on my Laserdisc copy of the restored version of the film that was released about 10 years ago and it is in widescreen letterbox format.  If this DVD version is anything like the Laserdisc, I can advise you right now without any doubt, to buy it because not to would be denying yourself special treasure and treat.
I won't bore you with what has been said before in other reviews about the excellent photography, acting, score, and costumes which are all true. I will add that this film was originally shot in cinemascope and that director William Wyler had used every inch of the screen to tell the story.  This means that there are many scenes that are totally destroyed when viewed in the standard pan and scan format of the old fashion standard television sets. I will give you two instances. When viewed in the standard format, when Ben Hur has the argument with Balistar while Jesus is giving the Sermon on the Mount, the long shot just shows Ben Hur just walking away with Jesus's head acting as a wipe as the pan centers on Ben Hur, but in the format that it was meant to be seen, Jesus's head is in the center foreground, stationary, and turns slightly as his gaze follows Ben Hur as Hur walks across the background from the extreme left to right of the screen. Another scene that gets destroyed in the standard pan and scan format is the scene where Hur hides behind a boulder while Hester enters the cave of lepers.  In the right format, you actually see him agonise behind the boulder when he discovered where his mother and sister are.  Plus the nativity scene is greatly enhanced by the cinemascope format where you don't see the holy family until the slightest of move by the camera. Many more scenes are just not the same in the pan and scan standard format.  So much more is seen in the widescreen.
Also, I believe one of the best and understated special effect ever done is the Star of Bethlehem. I marvel every time I see it.  It was beautifully done.
Lastly I would like to add some trivia to this.  In the race scene, when the chariot runs over the crashed chariot and flips the diver over in front of the chariot and the diver has to climb back over into the chariot, that was not a stunt. That was a real accident and the stuntman (who was the son of the man who did the famous drag under the stagecoach in ""Stagecoach"") is really climbing back in to save his life. Secondly, if you are a fan of director Sergio Leone (""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""Once Upon a Time In The West"", ""Once Upon A Time In America"" and many others), he was secound unit director on this film.  Lastly, as I understand it, the original silent version is included on this disc.  That is good because it was during the filming of that version that a standard practice of filming action races was set.  If the disc has commentary on the silent version, then check out how they did it, the answer is something else.
I plan on buying this disc.",1129075200,,3110,4.3633217993079585
1337440,5,B00003OSTA,"The film Ben Hur is set in the time of Christ, circa 33 BC. This is the story of two boys, one Roman, one Jewish. It seems from the time the two were children, they were close enough to be brothers. So close in fact an observer might even infer, a closeness of another kind. Still, the story is reminiscence of their childhood when the two boys meet after an absence of some ten years. One portion of the film purports to remind the audience of the heroic actions of the Roman Boy (Stephen Boyd) and how after a decade, expects that by saving his friend's life, the Jewish boy (Charlton Heston) will feel the importance of honor and friendship for the new position of responsibility of the Roman Tribune. Instead, the Jewish boy, who also has grown up, feels the weight of the empire and hopes his friend is there to loosen the Roman grip on the land of Judea. This meeting, begins friendly enough, but soon explodes with bitterness and a feeling of betrayal. The Roman boy, feeling Judah owes him his life and loyalty, is rebuffed, by the sense of patriotism felt by the newly acquired faith of the people of Judea. What follows then is a series of tragedies. Judah chooses his self-importance and his people over his friend and allows disaster to place him at his friend's mercy. Having chosen faith instead of friendship, Messala allows his former friend to suffer the punishment of his own folly. Judah cannot understand his friend and sets out on the long road of revenge, killing two men in the process and eventually doing the same to his friend. In all, it's Judah who betrays the man who gave him life and allows him to die in the arena. The story of revenge is complete. Lesson learned. Save your friend and you may live to regret it. The film is spectacular in both breath and scope. Having garnered eleven awards, little more needs to be said. ****",1128988800,,1860,4.505917159763314

The 1925 version restoration with the 1987 music score is startling.  I find it, in many ways, a more compelling story telling than the 1959 version, and the visuals/effects/cinematography are stupendous for the time.

It was as if watching and hearing it for the first time.  It is clearly the pinacle of filmmaking and a master class of craftsmanship.  It would have been nice if the film did not lose the one screenplay academy award of the twelve of which it was nominated.  It still would have been the champ to this day and deservedly so.  Unfortunately Karl Tunburg got credit for writing the entire script and director William Wyler campaigned on him not winning the oscar since most of his script was re-written by Christoper Fry, Gore Vidal and others who got no credit.

1337463,3,B00003OSTA,"This movie has an important place in cinematic history, as the reviews make clear.  There are too many lengthy shots of actors and actresses trying to look tormented or blissful.  Apparently this was considered effective at the time, and perhaps it was more effective then than it seems now.  But this ""bad acting"" is really a fault of the director and the script itself, as usual.

We learn from the extra features that the young Gore Vidal rewrote part of the script.  This does explain something.  Compare the initial reunion scene between Messala and Ben-Hur to the same scene performed by different actors in the screen test.  The screen test does not suggest an ""emotional relationship,"" as Vidal put it, between the two characters.  The movie appears to be Lew Wallace as re-interpretted by Gore Vidal.  I had not seen this movie before getting this DVD; and if I had known that Gore Vidal had had a hand in the script, I would have waited for yet another remake of the movie at least.

I have not read the novel, but the story seems to be good.  As presented by the movie, it would have been better without Gore Vidal's influence.  The dialogue is weak, although the indirect treament of Jesus' preaching seems just what is called for.  The miracle at the end is not implausible, but it is novelistic, not scriptural.  The movie is thought to have a Christian theme, but Jesus' Resurrection is conspicuously not indicated plainly, exactly when it seems that a Christian perspective would call for such an indication.

Movie makers have something to learn about representing antiquity if they care about historicity.  ""Grandeur"" was very exceptional.  Things in the ancient world were generally scaled small, to the human, not everywhere crummy, but hardly impressive.  Pompeii shows how the ancient Latins painted grandiose scenes on the walls of small rooms.  They imagined more grandeur than they could make real.  Articles available then -- cloth and clothes, spoons, combs, nails, weapons, etc. --  were costly and rare, entirely handmade, until historically recent times; and the means for making them -- kilns and looms, for example -- would have been a little more in evidence than they are in the movies.",1127520000,,2220,4.898123324396783
1337464,3,B00003OSTA,"""Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ"" by General Lew Wallace, as the credits bill it, is a typical example of what Hollywood can do when it wants to fake piety (remember ""The Robe?""), make a lot of money, win some awards, and tell a tale that reinforces the Bible stories and myths that greet us on Christmas and Easter cards. The mission and crucifixion of Jesus provide the context for a fictional narrative ending with a miracle that comes none too soon. This nearly four-hour marathon has long overture and intermission music but (God is merciful) no exit music. Warners' deluxe reissue on four discs includes the original silent movie and a disc of extra features.

While the familiar passion of Christ unfolds as the characters encounter it, but not as Mel Gibson reinterpreted it, General Wallace tells of two childhood friends, a Jewish prince (Charlton Heston) and a Roman tribune (Stephen Boyd), who as adults clash over allegiances. The Jew is betrayed by the Roman and sent into slavery, where during a sea battle he rescues a Roman consul (the wonderful Jack Hawkins) who adopts him. He returns to Judea a rich charioteer to challenge his nemesis, who is killed in the ensuing race. He has a couple of encounters with Jesus and a former slave girl he loves, and he accepts Christ when after His death a miracle cures his mother and sister, who have become lepers.

There are some marvelous performances in this movie, starting with those by Hawkins and Boyd as the ambitious Roman who really loves his Jewish chum (he was secretly told to play it that way). Hugh Griffith steals his every scene (and won a supporting actor Oscar) as a conniving trader with four Arabian horses to whom Heston whispers. To give the film stature, William Wyler was hired to direct; but he didn't direct its most famous sequence, the exciting chariot race, a triumph of editing and cinematography. And there's a thundering Miklos Rozsa score to match the movie.

""Ben-Hur"" by today's standards (""Troy,"" ""Alexander,"" Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"") is a solemn and ponderous epic shot mostly on backlots and soundstages where even outdoor voices and noises echo. The costumes look like new clothes worn for the first time. Some of the acting is overcooked (Heston) or underdone (Haya Haraeet, his love interest.) Yes, the acerbic (and uncredited) Gore Vidal did indeed try to doctor the reverential script. ""Ben-Hur"" was state of the art in 1959 so we should show some Christian charity and try to stay awake. It did take home a record eleven Academy Awards.",1127433600,,2564,4.8493150684931505
1337465,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is one of cinema history's most renowned and expensive titles that swept the house at the Oscars in 1960.  The only nomination it did not win was the best-adapted screenplay, which went to Room at the Top (1959), but it successfully claimed eleven other Oscars, including best film and best actor.  Charlton Heston brought the agonizing struggles of the Jewish prince Ben-Hur to life through his excruciating search to find an outlet for his internalized pain brought upon him by the Roman oppression.  Compared to contemporary performances by Hollywood actors such a Sean Penn or Tim Robbins, Heston appears stiff and rigid in his performance.  However, Heston's inflexibility in front of the camera is a perfect match for the character, as Ben-Hur suffers a tragic journey of endless loss and grief.

A map and the voice of the narrator (Finlay Currie) help clarify the major historical aspects of the Roman Empire and the importance of Jesus Christ's birth at the time.  It is an intriguingly multifaceted opening that presents immensely detailed background of the two major characters Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).  The tale of Ben-Hur rests on a foundation based on General Lew Wallace's novel that runs parallel to the life of Jesus Christ, which also intertwines the existence of Ben-Hur and Jesus.  Through the infusion of Jesus into the story, it also provides a meaningful perspective of Christian philosophy.  The moral message in the film, heavily applies the great injustice and difficulty that Ben-Hur has to endure, which leaves the audience with several notions to ponder.

Ben-Hur and Messala, once childhood friends, discover that that life has come to a crossroads where both have decided on their own path.  However, before they part they reunite when the Roman Messala returns to the Judea, as the new garrison commander for the Roman Empire in Judea.  When Messala commands his friend Ben-Hur to give up the names of some Jews that are resisting the Roman Empire, their friendship ends, as Ben-Hur decides on the righteous path while keeping the names a secret.  Further predicaments emerge when the new governor arrives, as Ben-Hur's mother and sister are put under arrest while he finds himself being sentenced to a life as a rower on one of the Roman galleys.  Unaware of his family's fate and several painful years behind the oar Ben-Hur's hate grows stronger for the Roman Empire, which is responsible of his agonizing destiny.

Through Ben-Hur's existence and struggle director William Wyler creates a visual journey where emotions runs free and passionate anger feeds the hate of the protagonist.  However, Ben-Hur will find a moment for the vengeance he is seeking through luck, or maybe with the help of God. In either case, it will have a profound affect on Ben-Hur, as he will cross his path with the Christian philosophy.  This leaves the audience with a remarkable adventure of unfortunate luck and numerous moral thoughts to contemplate.

Ben-Hur was at the time, the most expensive film of all times produced by MGM, which was facing bankruptcy when the film was made.  However, this epic spiritual journey of Ben-Hur helped save the Hollywood company out of financial abyss, as the film grossed record amounts of money.  Together with several aspects of filmmaking Wyler directed a film that has an unforgettable score, awesome cinematography, terrific mise-en-scene, and an excellent chariot scene that will go down as one of the best races in film history.  Besides these cinematic facets, an excellent cast dynamically enhances the intriguing elements in the film and will leave the audience thoroughly entertained and deep in thoughts.",1127260800,,3715,5.127694859038143

1337468,5,B00003OSTA,"The standard by which all Hollywood epics must be held, both the 1925 & 1959 versions of Ben-Hur stand as two pinnacles which bracket the golden age of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).

As you are probably familiar with the story, I will limit my comments to the presentation of this new 4-disc DVD;

The outer sleeve is surprisingly flimsy and one must be a bit careful in pulling the main section in and out, otherwise you could easily dent and rip the sleeve.  The casing for the DVDs is somewhat similar to the ""Frasier"" series and includes a nifty booklet.

The 1959 version of Ben-Hur is presented on the first two discs in the widescreen format and the movie has never looked better. Especially impressive are the numerous close-ups in which the actors look like they are right in your living room.  The Technicolor process is still unmatched today and the 65mm format in which Ben-Hur was filmed is quite stunning.

The extras for these two discs are two items;
- Feature commentary by Charlton Heston & film historian T. Gene Hatcher.  Heston simply relates the stories behind the scenes (some of which you probably have heard before) and comments about how good each and every actor is (I'm waiting for a commentary where an actor tells how terrible someone is) while Mr. Hatcher gives more details about each scene, points out bloopers and who was considered for each role before filming began (his point about Robert Ryan as Masala is one I definately agree with).

- A music-only track where Miklos Rozsa's Oscar winning sountrack can be heard by itself.  This is a great feature and one which I hope is done on more DVDs.

Disc 3 consists of the 1925 version of Ben-Hur.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary track or other extras.  A shame really since this version has some facinating trivia, as well as being a great film in and of itself.

Disc 4 has two full documentaries;
- 2005 Ben-Hur: The Epic that changed Cinema.  Features many modern Hollywood notables including George Lucas, Ridley Scott, & especially interesting is cinametographer Ernest Dickerson commenting on how this version of Ben-Hur is the first ""modern"" Hollywood epic.  I don't know if I agree with that (I think it should be ""Spartacus"", but I'm sure that there's plenty of room for discussion), but it is an entertaining, if not particularly enlightening hour.

- 1994 Ben Hur: The Making of an Epic: I believe this was shown on Turner Classic Movies, but anyway, it's the ultimate documentary on the history of Hur from the initial book through the 1959 film.

- Ben Hur: A Journey Through Pictures: This is pretty much a waste of five minutes.  Basically, it's mostly photos from production stills edited to Rozsa's score.

- Vintage Newsreels: Several short newsreels that cover the openings of ""Ben-Hur"" at various locations, including the world premier in New York City.  Nothing really all that interesting about them, except perhaps that you get an idea of just how big this film was in terms of appeal & noteriety. The newsreel of ""Ben-Hur"" opening in Japan is the most interesting.

- Screen Tests: Only three actual ""tests"" are included, most famously the one of Leslie ""Way Before Airplane"" Nielson as Masala, who tries hard but it was probably a good idea that he wasn't cast in the role. I'm assuming that these three tests are the only ones to survive, because it would've been interesting to see a greater sample.

The sole make-up test included is one of the lovely Haya Harareet in an odd-looking gold headress and RED? hair, making her look more like a queen from an Italian gladiator film (in fact, this make-up footage could be from ""Journey Under the Desert"" a 1961 film where the publicity photo shows her in an almost identical headdress).  Rozsa's ""love theme"" score is also included here and it makes for a interesting five minutes of Ms. Harareet looking rather bemused.  Although for sharp-eyed enthusiasts, you may want a second look at her ""top"" (which looks suspiciously like a modern bra) because I think it's see-through.

- Trailers: Again, not much of interest here, unless you are interested in the progression of how ""Ben-Hur"" was marketed via trailers. It is interesting that the first one (released before the film opened) shows very little of the movie itself.

- 1960 Oscar Highlights; This feature is poorly edited with the sound popping in and out (which probably was on the original recording).  Why this was so badly done is beyond me since many of the sound ""mistakes"" could've been edited out.  One thing it does reveal is just how short acceptance speeches were back then, a lesson for the long-winded winners of today.

Overall, this collection is one for the fans and while it may not be the last one (I can definately see an ""ultimate"" edition with more screen/make-up tests coming along), it certainly is complete enough for all but the most ardent fanatics.  It also gives a chance to compare both the 1925 & 1959 films which reveals that the original still has moments that outshine it's more famous remake.",1127001600,,5047,4.801156069364162

1337482,5,B00003OSTA,"...the 1925 original silent version would not have seen the light of day for us commoner consumers.  Granted, Ben-Hur (1959) is not the greatest film in the world.  It may not deserve all its 11 Oscar wins, or whatever else the nay-sayers and critics of the film want to believe.  But would there have been any interest in the 1925 original had the 1959 remake never existed?  Think about it.  Most people would rather watch a `talkie' picture in Technicolor than a black-and-white silent with no audio.  If you don't believe me, just ask anyone you meet!

I love the 1959 version the first time I saw it.  It was on the day before I got drafted into military service.  Charlton Heston's powerful acting helped in sitting through the entire film without ever being bored.  I have no doubt he deserved the Best Actor award even if others feel the movie did not deserve that many awards.  Ben-Hur was my favorite film for a while, and back then I was not aware of the 1925 silent version (nor was I aware William Wyler, who directed the 1959 remake, was assistant director of the 1925 silent version).  I've heard nothing but good things about the silent version, but never had the opportunity to see it (other than a few short clips here and there).  Thanks to this special DVD release, now I do.

Certainly there are other Wyler's films that are more deserving of Oscars (but never won) than this ""crappy remake"".  The Little Foxes, Withering Heights, The Heiress, among others.  But Ben-Hur was the one that got honored, possibly as a way of rewarding those films that did not win (and it is neither the first time nor last time the Academy has done this).  It's got a 5-star production value across the board, from directing, acting, cinematography, costume, music score, special effects, editing, sound recording. It deserves nominations in all those areas.

But this is as close to an 'ultimate' edition as we'll ever see, and the MANY 'extras' it offers makes this THE copy to keep!

Among the many exciting bonuses:

A newly-restored print, with a 'Music Only' track, allowing you to savor one of Miklos Rozsa's greatest scores...

The long-awaited DVD release of MGM's 1925 silent version of ""Ben-Hur"", with Ramon Novarro in the lead, and beefy Francis X. Bushman as Messala. Arguably the greatest silent film of the 20s (it established MGM as the premier movie studio), it holds its own VERY well against the sound version, with a terrific sea battle and chariot race, two-strip Technicolor in key scenes, and a fabulous 'new' score, composed by Carl Davis. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat!

PLUS...

""Ben-Hur: A Journey Through Pictures"", which uses preproduction storyboards and sketches to show the metamorphosis of the film from concept to reality. Peter Jackson's ""Rings"" trilogy 'Bonus Features' really pioneered this concept, but the new ""Ben-Hur"" edition has taken it to a whole new level, and it shouldn't be missed...

Not one, but TWO documentaries on the making of the epic; the excellent 1994 Christopher Plummer-narrated piece (which was included in the previous ""Ben-Hur"" release), plus a brand-new documentary, offering insights by modern directors, cinematographers, and other production people on how the film influenced their work; George Lucas (who tends to be a bit dry) acknowledged that the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race did influence the pod race in ""Star Wars I"", and Ridley Scott admitted he watched ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" and ""Ben-Hur"" for inspiration, prior to making ""Gladiator""...One of the contributors is Charlton Heston's son, Frasier, a gifted filmmaker himself, who offers his own memories of the 'shoot'.

A very enjoyable documentary on the life and career of William Wyler, from 1984, full of home movies, 'behind-the-scene' photos and his last interview before his death...

AND all the extras from the previous release, including trailers, newsreels, screen tests (Leslie Nielson, so serious, is fascinating!), costume and make-up tests, and other goodies.

Finally, commentary by Gene Hatcher, film historian, and scene-specific comments by Charlton Heston, himself...while this 'extra' isn't 'new', Heston's failing health gives his words, recorded for the last ""Ben-Hur"" edition, a bittersweet quality...When he passes, an era will truly be gone forever...

1337488,5,B00003OSTA,"One of the landmarks of epic and, arguably world cinema, Wyler's 'Ben-Hur' holds up well today. It was conceived by MGM as an eventual follow up to the success of Quo Vadis? (1951). Almost four hours in length, including substantial overture and entr'acte music by the redoubtable Miklos Rozsa, the film garnered 11 Oscars in its year - a feat echoed recently by Scott's 'Gladiator', to which unsurprisingly it bears some resemblances. (The return of the wronged, or the cathartic role of the arena for instance) But there are vital differences, principal of which is the fact that, while Scott's epic is a pagan film predicated around the expectation of glorious death, Wyler's work is deeply Christian: ""a Tale of the Christ"" as the titles announce, hinging on the acceptance of eternal life.

'Ben-Hur' has a very considered structure, following Juden Ben-Hur's life and reconstruction, interposed with scenes from the life of Christ. In the first half we see Ben-Hur's fall from wealth and influence as a merchant, onto his fortunes as galley slave, rescuer and friend of a roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), then successful charioteer before returning to Judea to claim his vengeance. The second half includes the climactic chariot race between him and his enemy Masala, his confrontation with his mother and sister's leprous condition and, finally, Ben-Hur's witnessing of the crucifixion. Thanks to spectacular scenes such as the galley battle, the entry into Rome and, not least, the 20-minute chariot race (which took three months to film), attention in this mammoth epic rarely flags. Having said that, the first half of 'Ben-Hur' has more energy than the second, an issue primarily springing from the source novel. Wallace, its author, had planned his story so Ben-Hur's bitterness peaked just before the great race. Once the competition set piece is over and Massala dispatched, longer contemplative scenes inevitably follow as Ben-Hur broods on injustices. Like the leprosy of his relatives, he has a sickness albeit not physical, which must be cured, whilst in terms of action his rage has effectively exhausted itself.

As the principal male hero, Ben-Hur is one half of three strong male relationships in turn (Ben-Hur/Masala, Ben-Hur/Arrius and Ben-Hur/Sheik Ilderim). Although the relationships are fraternal, Ben-Hur's unmarried status, as well as the closeness of these associations with other single males (Arrius's wife is dead and Ilderim's several remain curiously unavailable) are enough to raise a vague question mark, at least in the minds of modern audiences. Kubrick would explore the homosexual elements prominent in ancient cultures more explicitly in 'Spartacus' a year later). In the more conservative 'Ben-Hur' the closest we get to the homoerotic torsos - a characteristic of the peplum cycle from Italy born on the back of such successful films as this - is the sight of an oiled and pampered Massala accepting Ilderim's bet with his fellow athletes and colleagues.

Lew Wallace conceived 'Ben-Hur' as a didactic work as much as one of historical adventure, key moments in the life of Christ to be viewed in connection with those of an aggrieved man of action. Understandably, the film makes more of the possibilities of action, and less of the religious message. One result of this is that it is noticeably successful in communicating reverence without boredom, a fault of several other 1950s epics. Always difficult to portray, Christ is never heard speaking directly, his face never seen. Instead we witness the impact he has on people's lives. Instead of Christ the man, we have the events he occasions: the Passion is treated as an event of political significance to Judah and his family. The socializing of the Christian message is in evidence, rather than any crude proselytizing. But once Massala is gone, Christ's continuing 'unavailability' to the viewer reveals a dramatic lack: we miss a necessary balance to Ben-Hur's strengths and convictions, where another rounded character might have stood. Ben-Hur's conscience fights on, but in a campaign vacuum as it were, and because of it he becomes weaker.

Interestingly, although Rome as an invading force is decried by Ben-Hur, apart from the harsh life of slaves and some enforced tax collecting there is very little to criticize in the Imperial occupation of Judea. Messala's twisted sense of justice is clearly a personal aberration, springing from his ambition. Both Tiberius and Pontius Pilate (who offers the Judean his citizenship) appear as reasonable men. Christ's trial is presented very briefly and then seen only at conclusion. One Roman even admits that Christian dogma is ""quite profound really."" Ben-Hur perhaps implicitly grants the value of Rome as much, accepting the role of Arrius' son, even appearing before Massala in a toga. If not quite a tacit acceptance of 'what the Romans have done for us', Ben-Hur could be far more condemnatory towards those fighting the fledgling religion of the Jews. Truly the film takes Christ's words ""they know not what they do"" as understood.

'Ben-Hur' then, is that rare creature, the restrained epic. Perhaps because the source is a novel than taken direct from the Bible, it manages to balance the sublime and ridiculous into a still-satisfying whole, balancing great spectacle on the one hand with subtle veneration on the other. Together with Wyler's direction, Heston's tailor-made presence, Rozsa's grand score and a unleaden clich-free script it still makes 'Ben-Hur' first.",1122508800,,5542,5.236486486486487

Author : Lew Wallace

  Review by Claire K. Martin

The story of Judah Ben Hur by Lew Wallace has inspired and intrigued millions worldwide since the book was first published in 1880. It is the story of a young Jewish Prince, Judah Ben-Hur, whose family has been imprisoned and he himself sentenced to the Roman galleys for life by Messala, his boyhood friend-turned-enemy, on the false charges of trying to assassinate the Roman Governor of Judea.

After 3 years of slavery aboard a galley, he saves the life of a high-ranking Roman official in battle, who then makes Judah his heir and restores his fortune. After Judah wins the famous chariot race in Antioch, in which he defeats Messala once and for all, he sets out to find his long-imprisoned mother and sister back in Judea. All the while seeds of rebellion sown long ago by the actions of the Romans in his land continue blossoming and growing to a raging blaze in his soul. Vengeance is his motivation.

A series of events leads him to meet a King, who had helped him mysteriously years before as he was dragged to the galleys. Judah recognizes him as a possible Messiah, and sets about building a small yet well-trained army to support the new King.

Surprised that Jesus doesn't seem to be the least bit interested in overthrowing the Romans, nevertheless Judah continues to hope that one day the King will rise up and seize power, banish Roman rule and establish a just Kingdom.

By the end of the novel Ben Hur realizes that the King was not to come to overthrow Rome but to save the souls of all mankind.-That the kingdom to be created was not to be one of this world, but of the Spirit, and he accepts the reign of Jesus within his own heart.

An excellent book, written in a Victorian style with no lack for detailed descriptions, the author spells out the search for truth and justice and freedom which so many in the world still grapple with. I recommend this book for all who are truly seeking the path to happiness, peace, and freedom.",1114646400,,2014,4.538674033149171

The ship battlefight sequences are particularily excellent. Very moving, very beautiful, and truly inspirational to all. I recommend this over all other items!",1114387200,,484,5.0625
1337502,5,B00003OSTA,"Winner of eleven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Ben-Hur is widely considered one of the greatest films of all-time. Combining powerful acting performances, unique set design, colorful costumes, and unrivaled visual effects for its day, Ben-Hur is a pleasure to watch. Like Lawrence Of Arabia, it's one of those rare films from yesteryear which remains a top-tier film to this day (i.e. the film itself doesn't seem old, nor do the special effects look amateurish). If you enjoy classic films like Spartacus, Cleopatra, or Casablanca, then Ben-Hur is a definite must-see for your list. Like Gladiator (2000), Ben-Hur manages to bring the Roman Empire into vivid display on the big screen...

Charlton Heston plays the title role of Judah Ben-Hur, an Israelite prince during the reign of Tiberius. Young and wealthy, Ben-Hur enjoys the finer aspects of life in the era of Pax Romana. When his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives in Jerusalem to serve as the Roman Governor, the two are reunited and enjoy each other's company. However, the two quickly find that their political views have created divisions between them, and when a brick falls from the house of Ben-Hur during a parade (almost killing Messala), Ben-Hur and his family face the wrath of the Roman governor.

Intent on sending a message to the Jews that he will have zero tolerance for rebellious behavior, Messala jails Ben-Hur's mother and sister and sells Ben-Hur into slavery. As Ben-Hur is taken away from his native land, he plots his escape and eventual return to exact vengeance on his sworn enemy... Ben-Hur's arrival in Jerusalem coincides with the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth...

Charlton Heston makes quite an impression in his title role of Ben-Hur, following up well on the heals of his mesmerizing performance as Moses in the equally successful film, The Ten Commandments. Heston's resounding voice bodes well for hero characters pulled from the myths of ancient times. His larger-than-life persona conjures images of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but without the accent. Heston's performance is complimented by a series of action sequences which set the tone for its designation as an epic film. One such series involves a battle between the slave ship on which Ben-Hur resides and another ship which attacks it. The other, and most memorable, scene from the film is when Ben-Hur engages Messala in a chariot race (which even if you haven't seen the movie, you've probably seen this part).

Overall, Ben-Hur lives up to its hype as an Oscar Award-winning blockbuster (it still holds the record for most Academy Awards, although the record has since been tied). However, the film itself is beginning to show its age in that modern epics such as Gladiator are far better in terms of entertainment value. The length of Ben-Hur is probably an hour to an hour-and-a-half longer than it should be. The plot can be slow and droning at times. Nevertheless, Ben-Hur remains a Hollywood classic and a definite must-see movie...

The spectacular images inside the 2.76:1 widescreen aspect are amazing to take in; you will want to view this film on a screen 36"" or larger, otherwise you'll be sitting REALLY close to the set.

The famous chariot race is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed.

  How big?  Consider this - of the eleven Academy Awards won by this one, the Supporting Actor winner Hugh Griffith didn't even first appear until an hour and forty minutes into the movie, a time when most good movies have gone to bed.

  This movie really needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can put it on.  The actors' nostril should be as big as hubcaps when they're shot in close-up.  Even in its original 2:76-1 aspect ratio BEN-HUR loses a bit of its punch the smaller it's shown.",1099612800,,850,4.617449664429531

1337508,5,B00003OSTA,"""Ben-Hur"" is a great example of the kind of large scale film-making that Hollywood occasionally did and in this case they did it first rate.  Probably what killed this kind of film-making is the excesses of later spectacles like ""Cleopatra"".  Thankfully, with the help of CGI, it was revived with ""Gladiator"".  Much has been said about the classic set-pieces (the chariot race, the battle at sea, etc.).  The central conflict of this film between the former friends Judah(Charlton Heston), the Hebrew, and Messala(Stephen Boyd), the Roman Centurion is what is most compelling about this film.  Boyd's rendering of the despicable Messala ranks as one of the great acts of villainy in screen history.  Heston, who many dismiss unfairly as a lesser actor(probably because of his conservative politics and presidency in the NRA) gives a commanding performance which is not an easy task when you're working on an epic scale like this.  His work in ""The Ten Commandments"" was probably good preparation for this film.  Lest we forget this film is also subtitled ""A Story of the Christ"".  Jesus makes appearances in this film, photographed from behind and usually with swelling music.  Basically these scenes are a cue to forget our bitterness, no matter what injury has been done to us, because there are larger things in life than our current predicament.  On a final note the DVD contains a first rate documentary as well as a great commentary track from Heston that dispels the legendary rumor that he was wearing a wristwatch during the chariot race scenes.",1096156800,,1554,5.007782101167315
1337509,3,B00003OSTA,"According to most scholars Wallace (1827-1905) would have much preferred to be remembered for his military commands as a Union officer during the American Civil War--but following this he turned to literature, writing both poetry and fiction.  His 1873 book THE FAIR GOD was immensely popular, and such later works as 1888's THE BOYHOOD OF CHRIST and 1893's THE PRINCE OF INDIA were also well received.  But he made his name with a single work: BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST, first published in 1880.  An instant and massive best seller, it has been through countless editions, was one of the great stage successes of the early 20th Century, has been filmed twice.

The basic story of Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince sent into slavery whose life later intersects with that of Christ, is extremely well known, and Wallace gives it all the blood and thunder that he can muster, cramming page after page with plots and subplots, brutal struggles, shipwrecks, famine, plague--and of course the famous chariot race that Hollywood would so well imprint upon the popular imagination.  It is certainly one of the most influential works of both its era and this era.

It is also extremely, extremely Victorian, which is to say that the style is elaborately and deliberately wordy.  Detail exists for the sake of detail, Wallace never uses a single word when twenty or more will do, and his sentence construction drips with enough spurious punctuation marks to fuel an entire set of grammar texts.  The whole thing seems to go on forever, and the plot construction is heavy handed for good measure.

If you enjoy the works of lesser-known Victorian novelists, you might find BEN-HUR to your tastes.  But in spite of this novel's almost legendary reputation, if you shudder at the thought of Charles Dickens you'll cringe over Lew Wallace.  Recommended... but only to those studying literary history.

1337510,5,B00003OSTA,"I read every one of 217 previous reviews; trying to understand why people love this movie, but did not come to conclusion with repeated expressions like: ""Ben-hur is one of the greatest movies of all time"" or ""The chariot race is the BEST part of the movie"".. well it is definitely not like the chariot fight of Gladiator.

However, among these reviews I liked the following negative comments that I hereby revitalize to equal the determined incomprehensible comments about the GREATNESS of this stupid classic.

Quote

  Certainly not a bad movie, certainly not worth 11 oscars, i guess nothing better came out that year, because this movies so long they could only make this

  ""Ben Hur"" richly deserves its status as a gay cult film -- never before nor after was Charlton Heston so hunky.

  Another is the cascade of Oscars it received - especially one to Charlton Heston for smoldering (considering that alternatives that year included Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like It Hot,"" Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest,"" and James Stewart in ""Anatomy of a Murder""). This is not even one of Heston's best films.

  While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story.

  Jesus makes a cameo in this movie but to my great disappointment he doesn't take part in the chariot race.

  I would recommend this movie for anyone looking for an in depth history of the time period, or just for someone looking for a little action and a lot of sleep.

  I knew that I was not the only one having a hard time keeping mentally stimulated through this ""classic"" when three of the four people that were watching Ben-Hur with me were asleep at the same time.

  The chariot race is great, but on the way to that race you have to face hours of suffocating piety, starting with the Star Over Bethlehem and all that.

  Instead of the movie keeping the pace, I kept it myself, with a little help of the fastforward button.

  You just spend ten minutes listening two the opening music, before anything happens. I first thought it was some sort of mistake. When the story finally gets started you just wish you were back with the music.)

  the Charlton Heston ""Ben-Hur"" is so overblown that you may feel the need of an Alka-Seltzer at intermission

  Remember you're a Womble! The problem with this movie is it's blatant theft from Smokey and the Bandit, they obviously believe a ""Roman Twist"" would confuse us.

The chariot  race (i don't call it the finale because it happens an hour before the end of the movie) is incredible, the camera work is excellent and the race is pretty brutal with guys getting crushed by flipped chariots, horses trampling men, and juda takes a dive over the front of the chariot (it was actually kinda funny to see this guy flip over the chariot so quickly but its real).  There is a battle on a slave ship which is pretty violent for a G rated movie because it shows slaves with cut off hands and feet with bone sticking out and blood.

1337522,5,B00003OSTA,"When you hear the word epic, what does it make you think? A great hero's difficult journey? Well, that's what I think and Ben-Hur fits into that sub-genre perfectly. This film is remake of the 1925 master-piece of the same name. In my opinion, this is definitely the better version.

All aspects of this film are top notch. Charlton Heston, Hugh Griffith (who made the best performance) and the rest of the cast do an excellent job. William Wyler directs this film so well that it leaves no doubt in your mind that he has to be one of the gretest directors ever. The cinematography and the editing are breath-taking. The use of the 65mm camera was perfect for this epic because it gave the film the wide screen grandeur that it deserved. The rowing scene and the chariot race were edited almost flawlessly. And the other aspects were awesome too.

My only complaint is that the film is a little too long and has alot of dialogue in it but it's still really good. I also love the treatment they did of Christ. Instead of picturing His face in the scenes that He's in (which is only a couple), they just show His back or somehow edit around showing His face. Very good work because it leaves it to your imagination of what He might've looked like.

The film received an unprecidented 11 Academy Awards (only Titanic, which is horrible movie in my opinion and LOTR 3 have tied it) and I think it deserved every one of them. No film of it's time has come close to being as great as this film. If you want to see a great film, then this is it.",1092700800,,1538,4.351916376306621

Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a respected merchant in Judea whose people are under the yoke of Roman rule.  He soon breaks ties with his life-long Roman friend Messala (Stephen Boyd)after his family and livelihood fall victim to Roman injustice.  Condemened as a traitor to serve in the galleys under the command of Quintus Arius (Jack Hawkins), Judah Ben Hur keeps faith in his Lord and vows revenge against Messala.  Our hero is soon taken to fight Macedonian pirates and to impress the crowds in Rome's Circus Maximus.  Finally free, he returns to Judea to exact his revenge.  His woes and hatred go unabatated until the Resurrection.

The film's theme is similar to Job's story in The Old Testament.  A devout man's faith is tested by God's taking away of all that makes him human: his family, his wealth, his sense of self.  All that remains to test in him is his faith. God will not stop plaguing Judah with woes until he's convinced of his undying faith.  The story is epic and well adapted as a film with one of Miklos Rosza's most memorable musical scores.  Although the film is rather heavy handed with its evangelical theme (Jesus scenes with choir intruductions, divine miracles, the resurrection, salvation etc.) that's the theme of the book as intended by its author and is therefore unavoidable. Despite the often overpowering biblical theme: I find the the story to be a moving epic regardless.  My favorite part is when Quintus Arius descends in to the rowers' benches in the Roman Galleys and exclaims:

""...that's good, hate keeps a man alive: it gives him strength!  Now listen to me all of you! You are all condemned men whose purpose is to serve this ship, should you fail you will sink with this ship chained to your oar: row well and live!""

Although his muscular anglo-saxon build hardly met the physical requirements for the role, Charlton Heston's persona as Ben Hur brings a commanding figure and presence to the story.  His acting style is consistent with the other loin-cloth characters he played in other films before and after (i.e. Moses in 'The Ten Commandments' and Taylor in 'Planet of the Apes'.)  Jack Hawkins (Bridge on the River Kwai; Zulu) as Quintus Arius also brings a commanding presence with his theatrical background as the cynical consul.  Stephen Boyd as Messala plays one of the most memorable roles especially in the part where he affirms his hatred of Judah at the end of the chariot race: one of the most memorable performances in Hollywood history.  The worst performance in the film is without a doubt that of Haya Harareet as Esther: utterly unattractive and barely proficient in English, her vapid expressions and forced acting undermined the intensity of every scene she appeared in.  Being Palestinian,  the main reason for her casting in the role was most likely political instead of being based on any standard of competence: done so to demonstrate a spirit of cooperation between the Israeli government and Palestinian authorities at the time.

This is truly one of the greatest films ever made.  Director William Wyler did an outstanding job with this staggering film production.  The 20+ minute chariot race was a real event and it's still to this day an unprecedented spectacle in film: it involved no CGIs or studio shots of an actor riding a fake chariot with a moving backdrop.  Even for those who, like myself, don't care much for the evangelical themes that mark this story, this film presents a moving epic on injustice and a man's spiritual triumphs for which one doesn't need to be a devout Christian to enjoy.",1092009600,,3823,4.899068322981367

There are no words to describe this multiple (11) Oscar winning movie. The acting, the chariot races (!!!) and the costumes are all wonderful! It is simply amazing how a movie made in 1959 surpasses by far most movies that have been made in later years.  Ben Hur is about honor, bravery, and heroes from a time long gone.

1337528,4,B00003OSTA,"I have lost count of the times I've seen this movie, and have lately sat through yet another viewing.  As it is deep, exploratory and powerfully moving, I make no apologies for still finding something in it.  I may even be preaching to the nostalgically converted when, as a boy, I grew up with it, seeing it on its territory, the 'big screen.'  Having felt the same satisfaction then, I now find the space to appreciate it at a deeper emotive level. Those timeless emotions of thought and feeling in it, are layers I continue to find and appreciate.  Why does this film continue to stand the test of time?  Because of its eloquent handling of feelings and conditions everyone feels, from the brutality of tyranny to subsequent reconciliation.  I have read some overtly
critical opinion about Heston's acting being 'wooden,' 'overblown,' 'pretentious.'  If his is bad acting, what do you consider good?  Isn't it just a case of appropriate or straight acting?
  I think Heston's performance is sedate, solemn, deep with meaning, as is the case with most of the other stars who compliment his.  William Wyler judges walking towards doorways and entrances, standing in them, turning up unexpectedly, with
classic precision which is almost theatrical.
  The scene where Hur meets and crippled dying Messala learning his mother and sister have become lepers, is one of my favourites, dealing with the theme of human intimacy and tragedy in a moving way.  Heston's shadowy figure standing in the doorway at Boyd's assertion, 'there Drusus, I knew he'd come,' is beautifully harmonised by Miklos Roza's music.  I therefore agree with a comment that Boyd is Heston's foil dominating every scene he's in, making Hur see the incompletness or hollowness of his chariot victory.  I see no enemy, a sweat-glistened Heston admits.  Then Boyd rasps, 'is there still enough of a man left here for you to hate?  Let me help you,' struggling in his crippled body.  Wyler folds over this scene beautifully.  Hur pulling Messala's dead hand grasp from his leather shirt, then walking into a deserted stadium looking yonder, languishing, yet not languished.  As all the other stars in the picture bridge the gap of Heston's at times stylised or dull acting, there are many scenes like this one.  But I think Boyd, not Hugh Griffith, should have received the oscar for best supporting actor.  He went on to play a 'nicer' Roman officer named Livius opposite Sophia Loren in samuel Bronston's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
  BEN HUR, because of its long-term devotion to the timelessness of psychological pain, misery, devotion, loyalty, healing, reconciliation and ultimate fulfillment, are what set it apart from today's generation.  It belongs to a different era, one which had the space to explore those themes of humanity, lost today.  Like comparable epics, such as SCHINDLER'S LIST or THE LAST EMPEROR, it has the strength to move.  But despite obvious artifice and incorrect historical detail which don't measure up to the book, it is more lasting than the present materialist mediocrity.  What is more enduring; that or something richly achieved with conviction, purpose and
quasi-Shakesperean?  I know which I would choose.",1086220800,,3211,5.0379506641366225
1337529,5,B00003OSTA,"In an age where mass-produced cynicism casts a suspicious eye on virtually all aspects of life, Ben-Hur is still a masterpiece of cinema that, after all these years , has at it's center a thoughtful human drama that is still capable of resonating within the collective of human experience.
Thankfully, the film doesn't allow itself to become weighted down by it's religious themes.  These serve mostly as a backdrop for the film's more character-oriented narrative in which the entire range of human emotions is encapsulated.
Surely this is one of the greatest movies ever made as it's longevity has bourne out over the harshest test of all: time.",1085702400,,647,4.9907407407407405
1337530,3,B00003OSTA,"There are those who think that the reputation of the 1959 movie version of Ben-Hur is a victim of its success -- that it's remembered for the chariot race, for being the biggest, the widest, the longest, etc., rather than its ambition to upgrade the historical spectacle genre into a drama of character and the clash between the ancient Roman and Jewish cultures. True enough, the film does seem to try to balance the visual dazzle with a serious sense of purpose, but succeeds in that aim only fitfully.
Give the production some credit for making the effort, anyway. William Wyler, one of Hollywood's better commercial practitioners, was hired to direct. There certainly are long stretches of expository dialogue which aren't tarted up with scenery or action. They cast an unknown Israeli actress, Haya Harareet, as the female lead, which was pretty daring for a big-budget epic. (She doesn't set the screen on fire, but she holds up her end well enough, considering that the script gives her only one good line -- you'll know it when you hear it -- and somewhere in the second or third hour I found myself appreciating her.)
I understand they brought in several high-class script doctors, including Gore Vidal. Vidal supposedly added a gay element to the relationship between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala, although there is no evidence of it unless you are among those who think that by definition any strong attachment of love or hatred between men must be sublimated homosexuality. In any event, the story line never rises above the serviceable, and sometimes sinks into near suspended animation.
I hadn't seen Charlton Heston in a long time, and I was a bit surprised. He shows more acting technique here than I would have expected (probably Wyler deserves credit for it), but he can't carry it beyond technique. His is a completely exteriorized performance, an audio-animatronic version of suffering, revenge and love. The tedium of watching Heston is somewhat relieved by Stephen Boyd, who breathes a reasonable degree of life into the character of his nemesis, Messala. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell, as Ben-Hur's mother and sister respectively, are empty vessels. The only performance you can really savor is by Jack Hawkins, as an aristocratic Roman naval commander who saves Ben-Hur by ""adopting"" him. Hawkins should have won the best supporting role Oscar instead of Hugh Griffiths, who hams it up as an Arab sheik.
So what about the spectacle? Well, the famous chariot race is undeniably one of the best action scenes ever filmed. It's no surprise that it's what everybody remembers from the movie. A second-unit director who knew his business, and the film editor, got the timing and angles just about precisely right.
Some of the sets are handsome enough, but for the most part Wyler didn't make particularly good use of the frame's extremely wide aspect ratio (about 2.70 to 1, I'd guess). Considering that the film long predated digital effects, the SFX are decent for their period, although during the too-frequent stretches when the attention wanders, it's hard not to fixate on some obviously painted backdrops. Incidentally, the rocky scenery in the background of the chariot racecourse looks more like Colorado Springs than Rome's Palatine Hill.
The DVD transfer was clearly made from a clean new print, the colors often ravishing, but no amount of adjustment of my player's sharpness control could overcome a slight fuzziness in some scenes, although others (especially the action sequences) left nothing to be desired. It is as if the lab that performed the DVD authoring reserved their best efforts for what they considered the money shots.",1085356800,,3665,5.0495049504950495

I'ts easy to see why this film did so well, it is brilliant in almost every way.
For those who don't know, Ben Hur tells the tale of a young prince of Judah named Judah Ben-hur, (Charlton Heston), who has a falling out with his boyhood friend Messala, (Stephen Boyd), that has dramatic repercussions. After an accident involving his sister and a Roman Governor, Judah and his family are locked away by Messala. This begins an epic story of faith and struggle. Judah ends up in as a galley slave on a Roman vessel. After he saves the lifeof the new Roman leader on the ship Quintus Arius, (a brilliant Jack Hawkins, Judah gains prominance as a Charioteer and gets his chance for revenge.
Along the way, Judah has a few very moving meetings with Jesus of Nazereth, this scenes are some of the most touching of the movie. Charlton Heston gives a fantastic performance as does Stephen Boyd. It's an epic movie in every sense of the word and the chariot race is worth the price of the dvd alone.
The only real weakness in this otherwise perfect film is the charecter Esther, (played by Haya Harareet), I really wish they cast Jean Simmons or Deborah Kerr in this part.

Superb acting, especially from Heston and Boyd (his finest performance), magnificently photographed in 65 mm wide screen, stereophonic sound and with one of the finest music scores ever written (Miklos Rozsa). What I wanted to add is that many have not seen this film because some see it as a ""religious picture"", and though it was written as a ""tale of the Christ"", it should be noted that when writing it, the author, General Lew Wallace, was NOT a religious man at all.. he was making a point of writing in defense of spirituality because he was upset with a man who was a ""non-believer"" (agnostic). In the process of writing the novel Ben Hur, he became a Christian.  THIS FILM was made by a Jewish man, William Wyler... and intentionally written without showing Jesus' face or allowing the viewer to hear his voice. You never even see Jesus performing a miracle directly... only seeing the ""miracle"" at the end of the film INDIRECTLY through a heavy rainfall after the crucificion. THIS FILM is NOT about Jesus as much as it is about the futile and pointless exercise in revenge and anger. It is about loving thy neighbor and forgiveness.... Christian ideals for sure, but appealing to those of any faith that advocates peace, love and harmony. We are shown this by example in a fantasic story of epic proportions and that includes loads of emotion and tons of action.

1337558,5,B00003OSTA,"First released in 1959, ""Ben Hur"" is one the grandest, if not the most courageous exploration of sublimated hoe-more-sect-chew-all love between men.
The film takes place in Judea during Jesus Christ's lifetime. It begins when boyhood friends, Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) are reunited in Jerusalem as young men. Messala is now a Tribune in command of the Roman legions that occupy Judea and Judah is both a prince and a wealthy merchant who objects to the Roman occupation in principle but does not overtly oppose it. Under the pretext of discharging his duty as a Roman soldier, Messala urges Judah to inform on any friends or acquaintances that refuse to accept Roman rule. When Judah refuses to comply with this request, Messala turns it into a demand stating that Judah is either for him or against him.
In reality, Messala is sublimating his repressed sect-chew-all desire for Judah and expressing it in consciously acceptable terms. Messala and Judah spent their boyhood together until the age of fourteen when Messala was sent to Rome. Undoubtedly the separation was difficult for both boys but for obvious reasons it traumatized Messala much more. In the first place, Messala was separated from Judah during the advent of his sect-chew-all maturity and before he could resolve any burgeoning sect-chew-all feelings for him. But at the same time, Messala was also transposed from an environment in which he enjoyed relative physical and personal freedom (He and Judah hunted together, and men in Judea are cool about crying when they are upset.) to one in which he underwent rigorous, depersonalizing indoctrination as both a Roman citizen and as a military officer.
Few things could have produced a more disastrous result since Messala now not only repressed his feelings for Judah, but also lacked adequate emotional tools in which to resolve them. As a result, instead of returning to the lost paradise of youth (One he references when he asks Judah if he still hunts jackals and wolves.) Messala attempts to indoctrinate Judah in the same way that he was. On the surface Messala is commanding Judah, but on an emotional level he is actually pleading with him, essentially saying ""Look, I can't go back to what we were so let's love each other by having you become what I am."" If Judah could properly identify the emotional process at work then he could possibly avert disaster. For example, he could say, ""Forget about all this governing Judea stuff, let's talk about you and me."" But because Judah fails to recognize the emotional process at work, he inadvertently rejects Messala's emotional advances with catastrophic results. Messala's identity is now trapped in an in-between state since he cannot return to his youthful past and Judah will not join him in his adult present. As a result, in order to prevent his own psychic annihilation, Messala must now destroy Judah-not so much because he rejected him but because his continued presence reminds him of what he has lost forever. For this reason, Messala has Judah condemned as a galley slave and imprisons his mother and sister in the local dungeon where all three face certain death.
After three years in the galleys, Judah is partially freed by a Roman Consul who identifies him with his own dead son. Judah subsequently saves the Consul's life and as a result, the Consul adopts him and trains him to race horses in the Roman circus.
The Consul's relationship with Judah is partly paternalistic and partly sect-chew-all-iced. In liberating Judah and training him to ride in the circus, the Consul unconsciously provides him with the sect-chew-all mentoring he requires to resolve his conflict with Messala. After all, in order to race in the Roman games, Judah must think and behave as a Roman, which means that he has now become indoctrinated in the same manner as Messala. This is apparent when Judah returns to Judea and confronts Messala, who can barely conceal his pleasure toward the fact that Judah has come back not as a Jewish prince or galley slave, but as a Roman aristocrat.
The sect-chew-all conflict between the two men is ultimately resolved during the film's climactic chariot race whose sect-chew-all symbolism is all too apparent.  The chariot race takes place in a public arena in which men dressed in scanty, flashy costumes drive powerful horses from chariots mounted behind them.
At first Messala dominates this conflict in several manners. Messala has won this race during all the years of Judah's imprisonment and exile, which means that in a sense he has publicly declared his hoe-more-sect-chew-alit-E. Judah is popular as a hometown boy, but his racing skills (in other words, his sect-chew-all prowess) are unknown here although, ironically, they are well known in Rome. Messala acknowledges this during the start of the race when he smiles at Judah and says, ""Hail Jupiter, grant me victory today."" In doing this, Messala references the fact that they are now competing together in a Roman environment. In this sense, they have fulfilled Messala's original wish that, having lost their childhood bond, they at least become the same type of man. In referencing Jupiter, Messala subtly reminds Judah that the chariot race is a pagan conflict that recreates their lost youth. Messala is saying to Judah, ""Good, you're finally here, let's play.""
As the race progresses, Messala realizes that he cannot defeat Judah and begins to whip him furiously, which is essentially an open expression of his sect-chew-all feelings toward Judah. At first Judah is indignant, but then he seizes the whip and lashes back at Messala for the first time acknowledging his own sect-chew-all feelings toward him. This sect-chew-all expression literally overpowers Messala who is mortally injured. Shortly before his demise, however, Messala attempts to destroy Judah's hope of finding his imprisoned mother and sister (and thus of returning to their pre-sect-chew-all past). In the throes of death, Messala declares to Judah that ""the race"" (their sect-chew-all dance) ""goes on.""",1077062400,,6086,5.092092092092092

1337560,4,B00003OSTA,"In a setting in which Christ is on earth, not yet beginning his ministry (around A.D. 26), comes a marvelous story of a man's journey toward the Lord. This motion picture, directed by William Wyler, 1959, is a non-stop chariot race from beginning to end! Charlton Heston plays Judah Ben-Hur, a regarded prince among the Jewish people, but now condemned by his once-boyhood comrade, (Stephen Boyd as Massalla), who has become a Tribune and loyal citizen of the Roman Empire.
Due to major differences in cultural background and heritage, the two boys who grew up together are now mortal enemies as men. Friction comes to the surface when Massalla tries to use Judah to betray his own people. Then when an accident occurs, which causes the death of a Roman governor, Massalla uses this excuse to accuse Ben-Hur of this incident, and condemns him to the galleys to serve on Roman fleet battleships, while imprisoning his mother and sister.
This journey of Ben-Hur's life is a wild bumpy ride, in which he seeks revenge, to return to his family he lost, and also an unplanned aquaittence with Christ. An unparelleled film of its timeframe, ""Ben-Hur"" is a passionate, heart-warming movie filled with conflict, love, and hope. From the battleship scenes to the chariot race and even to the quiet appearances of Jesus, this film remains a classic masterpiece in our minds even today. Availabe on VHS and DVD.

Heston's comments are sometimes interesting, sometimes not; and he actually seems to think that the village where Jesus spent his early adulthood was Bethlehem rather than Nazareth!  But it was definitely wrth listening to it.
As for the film itself, it is great, if flawed. All the main actors give fine performances, especially Stephen Boyd as Messala and Jack Hawkins as Arius. It takes some liberties with the book - which is not a bad thing since I think the book wasn't a very good piece of work - and with history, but nothing too outrageous, apart from having a Circus Maximus in Jerusalem rather than Rome. On the other hand, the recreation of small details of daily life is very good - the business-as-usual manner of the jailer trying to find out where in the dungeons Ben-Hur's mother and sister might be; the backstage arrangements of the chariot race.
It does contain some historical absurdities, but less so than ""Gladiator"", for instance. And it does get a bit slow towards the end - - but altogether it remains a great film, and it certainly deserved its Oscars far more than, say, ""Titanic"".",1070496000,,1742,4.845637583892618

This is exactly the same way that I feel about Ben-Hur.  While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story.  The whole romantic interest was thrown in to draw more people into the theaters.  I feel that more time should have been focused on the actual plot.  The movie ponders along and eventually comes back to the story in a lazy manner.  If this movie were brought out today, then it would be seen as a valiant effort, but overproduced and bland.

1337587,5,B00003OSTA,"This novel written by Lew Wallace in the 1870's, and published in 1880 is nothing short of a timeless classic. It's timeless because it has been a big seller ever since it was published 124 years ago. Because the story is rich in character, people from all walks of religion and life can appreciate this story set in a time of global religious turmoil. Ben-Hur is the story of a Jew's life-long quarrel with his counterpart and nemesis Messala, amid the Roman occupation of ancient Palestine and among the rise of the Christian Religion.
Brief Synopsis: As childhood friends-become-enemies, Judah and Messala always had a burning desire to over achieve each other. As tensions grew with the end of childhood and the beginning of adulthood, the two parted ways only to meet one day under a very peculiar and dark circumstance. As a Roman Prince strode through the streets on his horse, followed by his royal guards and gang, Judah, on his home's rooftop, came flying out to see what all the hype was about. Upon his looking down at the Prince from the rooftop, Judah could scarce get close enough to the magical prince. As though kicked over by the foot of fate, a parcel of the rooftop was sent tumbling down toward the horseman sending his beast to run amuck. Then Roman Guard, Messala, in his final attempt to spite Judah Ben-Hur, quickly pointed his finger in the direction of the innocent Judah casting a glow of malice over him. Ben-Hur became nothing, and his life was reset anew, forever to surrender his soul to his captors. Now a slave, Judah, of the house of Hur, must redeem his life, and that of his family's name. He must rise above slavery and into poverty where he must begin his life anew. Quick is the rise of a true hero, one who knows defeat but cherishes freedom. Read Ben-Hur to find out how Judah's life long quest of redemption leads to salvation and conversion to Christianity and how the restoration of his name and life comes on the day Christ Himself is crucified.
Ben-Hur is the story of freedom, and how quickly it can be torn away from us. This story teaches you that you must forever and always be mindful of, and merit, your good fortune. To those interested in the history of Christ and the religious standoffs of the times, I would strongly suggest reading this novel.",1063065600,,2302,4.617073170731707
1337588,5,B00003OSTA,"So much has been written about this movie that it is nearly impossible to say anything new.  This DVD is the best rendition of the film. (Turner video artists have told me that they made several attempts to get the aspect ratio right and this is the one that finally succeeded.  The film led me to the book and then to the silent version.  If you are looking for film-to-screen accuracy, then the silent film is more faithful to Lew Wallace's novel.  For example, in his diaries, Charlton Heston says he argued with William Wyler about the character of Esther, who was far less prominent in the book and silent movie.  But, this is Hollywood movie making and you need a beautiful woman on the screen, although in the later part of the film, when Judah returns, she still looks ravishing, hardly a woman who has fallen from social grace.  There are several stars to watch for:  Hugh Griffith as the Shiek; Finlay Currie as Balthasar; Frank Thring as Pilate.  Finally, the  magnificent music score by Miklos Rozsa, who is often over-the-top in other films, but properly underscores this film and gives it a terrific dramatic impact.

1337604,5,B00003OSTA,"1959: Ben-Hur swept the Oscars with 11 Academy Awards. It brought audiences into the evolving Roman Empire in the time of Jesus. The film was based on the book. It was a blockbuster then and is still impressive to see on DVD to this day. Charleton Heston was the definition of manhood in his day, and his film roles were always larger-than-life. He played Moses in The Ten Commandments only a couple of years earlier. In this epic drama, Charleton Heston portrays Judah Ben-Hur with convincing prowess. Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in a galley ship. After a sinking, he saves a Roman lord and is granted property and status. Due to certain differences, Ben Hur and his former friend, Messala, break their ties and become rivals for power. Ben Hur and Messala's relationship is integral to the story and is performed very believably rather than cliche friends-turned-enemies deal. Ben Hur's mother and sister fall victim to lepresy. As such, they must live in caves as outcasts.
Eventually, Ben Hur's rivalry with Messala is tested on the chariot races. This scene is the most famous in cinema, some would claim. It is impressive, with masses gathered around a circular arena and with bombastic music in the background. Later, Ben Hur finds himself in Israel, in Jerusalem, when Jesus is being crucified. Through miracles, Ben Hur's mother and sister are cured of their lepresy. Ben Hur repents of his former ways and becomes a better person. This film has all the makings of an epic film. They don't do films like these anymore. Spectacular, dramatic, large crowds and a panorama of lush cinematography. On DVD, the experience is incredible.",1050796800,,1637,4.892086330935252
1337605,5,B00003OSTA,"Yes, this movie was made forty-plus years ago, so it contains an uncomfortable amount of silly overacting so prevalent in dramatic films of that period.  Yes, the film is rife with stereotypical depictions of Romans, Jews, and Arabs, and offers a very sanitized version of a leper colony.  And yes, the movie has a religious theme, which makes it almost unworthy in today's politically correct culture.  Despite all of the above, director William Wyler gave the world an engrossing, beautiful film, complete with stunning cinematography, a compelling story, moving musical score, and perhaps the most famous racing scene in the history of moviemaking.
I first saw BEN-HUR as a young boy at a theater; I was captivated throughout the three hours, thoroughly entertained and in awe of the majesty on the big screen.  The film instantly became one of my favorites, and remains so to this day.  Few things do I enjoy more than watching a beautifully crafted, well made movie, and my appreciation certainly was not unique, as the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1959.
The story is familiar to us all:  Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a young nobleman from a prominent Jewish family reunited with his childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who returns to Judea as a Roman tribune.  There is genuine warmth and friendship between the two men, yet the clash of their cultures drives a wedge between them--a wedge that becomes a chasm as Messala banishes Judah to the slave galleys and sends his mother and his sister to prison.  Thus Judah's life becomes a quest:  a quest to survive, a quest for vengeance.  Judah survives the galleys to become the adopted son of a Roman general (Jack Hawkins), and his triumphant return to Judea permits him to challenge and subsequently confront Messala in a chariot race--a breathtaking sequence of spellbinding, unforgettable scenes.
And although Judah's heart is twisted with anger, BEN-HUR is also the story of love, redemption, foregiveness--all depicted under the shadow of the crucifixion of Christ.  And in the aftermath of the crucifixion we witness a miracle, a wondrous event that makes this movie so compelling.
A sweeping, extraordinary epic, BEN-HUR is highly recommended and well worth three hours of anyone's time.

1337606,5,B00003OSTA,"?Ben-Hur? is the story of Jewish nobleman, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), who is imprisoned by his one-time boyhood friend, now the Roman tribune, Messalah (Stephen Boyd). Judah's path to God and Messalah's road to ruin parallel the Christ story. Made in 1959, at a time when the studio system, like ancient Rome, was crumbling, ?Ben-Hur? is a masterfully paced, fully realized and intense ?religious? experience. This is by far the greatest of the Bible-fiction epics. It is told with such sweep and scope that one can only sit back and marvel at William Wyler direction, which rightfully placed the emphasis on the human drama and relationships set against the massive pageantry that one comes to expect from such film fare. The production values never overshadow the story. The climactic chariot race is fifteen minutes of pure adrenaline-infused exhilaration, topped off by the fact that both Heston and Boyd did their own stunt work, which must have been a harrowing experience! On Oscar night this movie topped out with 13 nominations and 11 wins including BEST PICTURE, the most Oscars ever awarded any movie until James Cameron's ""Titanic"" tied it some fifty years later.
Warner Home Video has done an outstanding job on this transfer. Albeit, they have cropped the image to the more widely accepted 2:35:1 aspect ratio (MGM Camera 65 presented the film originally as 2:70:1) this is a dazzling anamorphic transfer, full of rich colors, fine detail and stunning clarity. Only in the darkest scenes does the disc falter slightly and lose its otherwise pristine image quality. No pixelization, edge enhancement, aliasing or fine detail shimmering is present. Extras include a thorough documentary with interviews from surviving principle cast and crew. The film itself is split across two sides of a flipper disc but is separated at the intermission half way mark - a forgivable stop. The 5.1 remix is stirring, powerful and engaging, particularly with Miklos Roza's brilliant score that fills the expanse and raises the hair on the back of one's neck. This is a must have for anyone who love Hollywood epics. Sadly, ?Ben-Hur? also represents one of the last enduring masterpiece to emerge from Hollywood?s greatest studio ? Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

We follow his travels throughout the movie, and the way Christ is pivitol at the turning points in his life.

1337660,5,B00003OSTA,"One critical comment made concerning Hollywood is that the quality of movies released for the past few years has deteriorated because studio executives have sought mere personalities as opposed to true actors to headline their feature films. I somewhat agreement with this sentiment, but I am also glad that there are those in Tinseltown who have decided to restore some quality masterpieces from the past onto DVD. One of those outstanding works is the eleven-time Oscar winning 1959 rendition of the epic Ben-Hur.
In this classic are top-notch performances from well-trained thespians who could make their parts come to life. Charlton Heston's portrayal of the leading character Judah Ben-Hur was truly flawless and would earn Heston an Academy Award for Best Actor. Ben-Hur, if done today, could easily be played out as a two-dimensional cardboard figure, but Heston skillfully explored and revealed many sides to this one individual. Intertwined are scenes with Ben-Hur as the following: a family man of honor, a man trying to maintain his religious faith and perspective while struggling with vengeful thoughts against one-time friend, Messala, and after the takeover of the Roman government, an embittered former proprietor who has suddenly faced despair after being stripped of birthrights and close family ties.
Stephen Boyd, who played Messala, was also perfect in the movie. Like Judah Ben-Hur, Messala was, himself, portrayed as a complex character but very easily could have been done otherwise. Messala was a despicable traitor and could have been simply just that, but thanks to the brilliant screenwriting and acting, intermittent scenes revealed a Messala who remembered and once cherished Judah and his family only to, thanks to turning points that would later come about, let the promises of power and promotion destroy any sentiments affiliated with his upbringing.
Throughout this movie are adverse attitudes and tones that conflict and, yet, run parallel. Ben-Hur is a character who overcomes many hardships and cruel hands of fate because he is motivated by hatred and thoughts of getting even with his former friend, Messala, who, in turn, is also a very determined man, for he is ascending up the ranks of the Roman Empire. Though he cannot project himself as becoming at least the exact ruling equivalent of a Caesar or Marcus Aurelius, Messala nonetheless sees a golden opportunity to use his somewhat subordinate status to become ultimately supreme, subordinate in the sense that he is a mere officer of the Roman Empire but supreme in the sense that he has the knowledge and charisma to potentially become the acting autocrat in Judea, a region where the most powerful in Rome are too far away to fully wield their influence.
Perhaps what made the motion picture Ben-Hur such a success was the ability to complement the humanistic elements with each of the storylines that in the end would amalgamate and constitute just what an epic should be. The tasks of bringing about individuals as believable people with conflicting feelings of devotion, love, rage, revenge, and hatred were, no doubt, undaunting. However, director William Wyler had both the cast and the vision make each of these attempts such a success that it has made one ponder the following question: What is it that ultimately motivates me in life?",1034380800,,3341,5.177449168207024
1337661,2,B00003OSTA,"I was very disappointed with Ben-Hur.  It just never grabbed me like I had thought it would.  Many people talk of this movie as one of the great classic films but I just do not agree.  I knew that I was not the only one having a hard time keeping mentally stimulated through this ""classic"" when three of the four people that were watching Ben-Hur with me were asleep at the same time.
The rowing scene that eventually gives way to the sea warfar was definitely enjoyable and I think just about everyone is somewhat familiar with the chariot race.  After that however, the movie is just slow and drawn out.  The Story itself is actually pretty good and for the most part the acting was exellent, but there were a lot of things that could have been abbreviated.
I can see why people might like this movie, but it just was not my style.  I do not regret viewing it, I would actually recommend everyone to see it at least once due to the fact that it is regarded as a classic.

1337662,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is one epic that really deserves the label.  Big in every sense of the world, yet it manages to be intimate and personal.  The story is familiar to most:  the childhood friendship of a Roman and a Jew turns sour when the two meet as adults.  Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy young Jewish prince who despite his wealth cannot deny the plight of his people.  Judah's belief that the Romans are killing his people destroys his friendship with Messala, now a Roman tribune.  To prove his loyalty to Rome, Messala has Judah sent to the galleys as a slave, based on trumped-up charges.  Judah vows revenge and is consumed with hate for Messala and Rome.  His chance encounter with Jesus Christ sets him on a path he never thought he'd walk down.  There is so much to admire about this film.  Charlton Heston in the title role does a wonderful job portraying the title character's torment.  Stephen Boyd as Messala, gives the performance of his life.  There are wonderful performances from the supporting cast:  Finlay Currie (Mr. Shunderson in People Will Talk) as Balthasar, Sam Jaffe as Simonides, and Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim.  Griffith's performance is one of the great characterizations in this film.  His sheik is wonderfully human and believable.  The way he interacts with his horses provide some of the film's best scenes.  Jack Hawkins (Academy Award Best Supporting Actor) is stolid and dignified as Heston's adoptive father.  As the love interest, Haya Harareet is believable as Esther, a slave in the service of the House of Hur, who has loved Judah from her youth.  The DVD transfer is beautiful and the sound is great.  It's too bad they opted for a two-sided disc instead of two.  The way they've labeled the single disc, it's difficult to know which is ""Side A,"" (the movie) and which is ""Side B,"" (the extras).  It's also unfortunate that Warner Brothers (who seems to own most of the MGM library), again used the less than wonderful cardboard packaging.  Some of the extras are worth a look.  Heston's commentary during the movie is fun, especially his recollections regarding the chariot race.  The screen tests of Cesare Danova and Leslie Nielsen (testing for Ben-Hur and Messala respectively) are enjoyable to watch.  You'll have fun noticing the zippered back of Danova's costume.  The test seems to favor Danova, since Nielsen is off camera during most of their scenes.  The ""screen test"" of Haya Harareet seems more like a costume or lighting test.  There's no dialogue and what we see is a rather short head shot of the actress.  All in all, Ben-Hur is one of the most enjoyable movie epics ever made.  William Wyler's skill with dramatic tension and emotional impact help the storyline direct the focus of the film, rather than the special effects, which are quite amazing, even by today's computer generated standards.  The chariot race between Judah and Messala, among many others, is still one of the screens great moments.  I've seen it a million times, it seems, but it always seems fresh and exciting.  The biblical aspect of the storyline is handled with great care and sensitivity.  The change in Judah's life because of his meeting with Jesus is one of film's emotional highlights.  As is the crucifixion and Judah's reunion with his mother and sister.  By all means get this DVD not for the extras or the packaging, but for the sheer power of its narrative, its great performances, its epic scale, its impeccable musical score, and that incredible chariot race!  Lastly, try and view this on the largest TV screen you can find.  The larger the screen the bigger the impact this film will have on the viewer.",1033689600,,3646,4.809983896940419

1337688,4,B00003OSTA,"Ben Hur is a wonderful movie and a must have for any collection of classic films. Truly, one of the great epic films.  Also it is a Biblical epic that, sadly, even when made today is only done for TV and not the big screen.  I honestly believe the big studios don't think there is a large enough audience for a film like this anymore, but I think they would be suprised how many people would go to see a quality film like this if it were made today.  While I enjoyed the presentation on the DVD, colors are sharp, music excellent, I was dissapointed by the lack of choice in screen format. I had not bought this film already on Laserdisc because even though the widescreen is the ""preferred"" presentation that is far more equivalent to a theatrical presentation, some of us never saw these films in the theaters but only on TV in the scanned and cropped format. Buying both the widescreen and fullscreen laserdiscs was a hefty investment...  I had already bought two discs for ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and planned to eventually do the same for ""Ben Hur"".  Mind you it was not a case of studio double dipping.  The widecreen for ""Lawrence"" was a restoration released years after the fullscreen.  I waited on Ben-Hur because of the glitzy promotionals for the upcoming Digital Video Disc. DVD was supposed to have the capacity to show each movie either widescreen or fullscreen on the same disc, or even in both 70mm and Todd AO as some films were shot both ways.  As a matter of fact this extra video capacity was tooted as a big advantage, among others, over laserdiscs. So far I only have one DVD disc, ""Legally Blonde"" that contains both formats. I have noticed it advertised on some Warner Brothers films such as ""The Lost Boys"", but not many others. I realize that for a film like ""Ben Hur"" a lot is lost in the pan and scan ""cropped format"" for TV screens, but that is exactly the way I saw the movie for years on TV and I was very dissapointed not to have a disc where I could compare the two formats. I received the DVD as a gift. I was also dissatisfied with the cardboard holder of the DVD which is a bit flimsy.  Fine for a TV movie release like Salems Lot, but not for one of the great films like Ben-Hur.  I wonder if they are planning to release a box set?  I have been hearing a great deal about the studio practice of ""Double-Dipping"", re-releasing an enhanced version, extended version, directors cut or box set of a film only a few months to a year or so after they released it on disc for the first time.  The hope is that the same people who bought the disc, will buy it again just a short time later to get some extras not offered with the first release.  With a wonderful film like Ben-Hur anything new would be tempting to own, but this practice doesn't seem a very fair way for the movie studios to do business.  In the long run people will catch on and they may actually hesitate to buy some DVD's, even a great classic like Ben-Hur, for fear that something better is going to be released a few months later.",1023926400,,3028,4.345744680851064

1337691,5,B00003OSTA,"This masterful movie epic is based on a novel by General Lew Wallace. The movie mostly revolves around the fictional Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a wealthy; well-respected; prominent member of the Jewish community; and exiled Prince in Judea at the time of Christ. Ben-Hur's life is parralled by that of Jesus, the two were born at approximately the same time and they briefly meet at crucial time's in their lives.
Judea has a new Tribune and a new governor. The new Tribune,  Messala, is an old friend of Judah's and he is excited to visit his childhood companion again. However, the two soon discover that they have grown into very different men with very different views of the world. Messala wishes Judah to betray some of his countrymen who have made hated remarks against Rome. Judah refuses and their friendship is quickly disolved. Not long after, a freak accident leads to Judah's arrest and the imprisonment of his mother and sister. Judah swears revenege as he is condemned to death in the slave galleys.
BEN-HUR won 11 Academy Awards and it is not difficult to understand why. Over forty years after it's initial release the movie is still amazing and spectaclar to watch. William Wyler won his third Best Director Oscar with BEN-HUR and rightly so: the blending of all the various elements from costume to makeup to acting to action sequences to scenery to sets is perfect, all without any CGI.
Charlton Heston has always been one of my favorite actors (I guess I enjoy his overemoting, that's usually better than no emotion at all) and he pulls off the performance of his career as Judah Ben-Hur. He never could quite pull of a performance that matched his work in BEN-HUR. And as a side note the rest of the cast is just as interesting to watch.
The movie runs for an incredible time of almost 3 and 1/2 hours. Yet, not once during that time does the film drag. It moves carefully from one point of the story to the next without ever losing continuity.
Judah's conversion to Christianity isn't as blatant as it is in the novel and other versions of the film. Yet, that in no way distracts from the power of the movie. In fact, Judah's conversion in this BEN-HUR seems much more believable and realistic. Not every Christian has a dramatic conversion experience.
BEN-HUR is a great movie. It's a tale of humanity told through the life of one man. It's filled with adventure, romance, revenege, action, drama, and even a little comedy. The action scenes are thrilling and the chariot scene has had a profound impact upon filmmaking (anyone see the pod race in THE PHANTOM MENACE). Movies don't get much better than that.",1018742400,,2638,4.72234273318872
1337692,5,B00003OSTA,"When it comes to movies like this, there is only one rating, ""5"". This is a Master Classic that should be in every collection. Charlton Heston and Jack Hawkins are flawless in this movie and the Chariot Race says it all.

1337693,5,B00003OSTA,"Just about everybody agrees that the 1959 version of ""Ben-Hur"" is a great movie. The DVD itself is what I'm reviewing here. The picture quality is very good, sound is nice, and the optional French dubbing is very well done. The movie is shown in its original (very) widescreen format. I've seen Ben-Hur on HBO, and they ridiculously show it in full-screen format.  You're missing half the picture that way. This movie was specifically created to take advantage of the widescreen process. There is a very long and informative documentary that includes: info about General Lew Wallace and the publication of his book Ben-Hur, the making of both Ben-Hur movies, interviews with writers, plenty of behind the scenes photos and film clips. Most interesting bonus is the screen test with Leslie Nielson, who was almost cast as Messala. The script they were using was not as refined or eloquent as the final version that made it into the movie.",1016928000,,937,4.8930817610062896

1337696,5,B00003OSTA,"What can I say that hasn't already been said below? I guess: GET THEE THIS MOVIE! :-) There is a reason why this movie is in the top 50 of all time movies ever produced as judged by the American Film Institute.
Some interesting points that may interest you:
The DVD has a featurette on the history of Ben Hur from the written story to the first plays and the silent movies. They show a lot of clips from the early attempts, too. It's narrated by Christopher Plummer. Top quality.
The DVD also has a commentary by Heston that is very interesting to listen to. It doesn't run the whole length of the feature but is in snippets (it fast forwards to the next one). I think that makes the commentary more accessible.
The movie itself still holds up well in story, characters, and in production. One interesting note comes from the featurette. The Christianity in this movie is a little toned down from the book and the first silent film (also worth watching). This is due to the changing times. In the book and first movie the conversion of Ben-Hur is clear but it's less clear here.
Still, the portrayal of Christ indirectly and the life of Ben Hur is wonderful and sure to please any audience.",1012348800,,1190,4.463302752293578
1337697,5,B00003OSTA,I want to write this review because I have both the DVD and the VCR of Ben Hur and the DVD is so much better that it is difficult to believe. The clarity and detail of the DVD make watching this great film a whole new experience. The chariot race is the greatest action sequence ever filmed and it is thrilling to watch with DVD. I have quite a collection of VCR movies but I've purchased this movie and about two dozen others for the joy of REALLY seeing it as I never have before. The added features about the making of the movie are also very enjoyable.,1012262400,,556,4.157407407407407

I just tried to make 5 fimls list of my all time favorite (You know how difficult it is). Cleverly, I tried to choose 5 top movies which will stay in the list whatever happens instead of trying to choose solid five. After five filmes popped upt,  I shut the door quickly. Here is the five (No order).
Ben-Hur
Chinese ghost story (I)
Jesus Christ Superstar
My life as a dog
The good, the bad and the ugly
The greatest Ben-hur has everything. Don't you agree? Epic, romance (not ugly though), history, God, chariots(!), battle at sea, revenge...but most importantly, everything was handled very well unlike the other so called epics. This is a real full range movie, greatest of all greatest. What can I say more? Well, here's my personal story though.
When I was a little boy, there was no VCR and my dad used to make me jealous by saying he and his girlfriend (turned out to be my mom, surely) watched it at a theater which had biggest screen in our country at that time.  I'd have to wait until 1982. Until then I had to be satisfied with a book of ben hur which was not that great. When I finally got a chance to watch this, I was a middle school student. Wow! I still remember the excitement when I saw a poster of Ben-Hur. The day, though, I was late due to some reason which I cannot remember. When I entered the theater, the scene of  underground prison scene was going on. Roman soldiers realize their prisoners (Judah's mom and sister) are SICK as I still remember so vividly.  I cannot believe it was 20 yrs ago...  This movie easily deserves the title of THE GREATEST. You would agree with me.",1011484800,,1643,4.356209150326797
1337709,5,B00003OSTA,"Set in the time of Christ during the height of the mighty Roman Empire, historical epic Ben-Hur follows the lives of two former childhood friends Judah Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Steven Boyd). They become the bitterest of enemies as they grow older, as the latter shows unswerving blind loyalty to the Roman Empire.
After Ben Hur refuses to help Messala round up what he perceives to be enemies of the Empire, he is framed for a crime he did not commit and is sentenced to a life of living hell on a galley ship as a slave.
His blind belief in his fate coupled with a thirst for vengeance helps him to survive this torturous existence. For three years, he is chained to an oar until during a battle with Greek pirates he saves the life of the Roman commander Quintas (Jack Hawkins), who takes Ben-Hur under his wing and frees him from his life of bondage. He becomes the main trainer of Quintas's stables and in time his adopted son and heir. Believing that Massala has killed his mother and sister, Ben-Hur exacts revenge by challenging him to a chariot race.
The 40 minute race took three months to shoot, in an arena that was a year in the making, and was one of the most ambitious set pieces ever staged by a major Hollywood studio, forming the focal point of the movie.
The DVD version of this movie has to be seen to be believed! The restore picture quality is awesome!",1010966400,,1387,4.443137254901961
1337710,5,B00003OSTA,"The movie Ben-Hur left out so much from the book, it was a wonderful read to re-discover the ""Real Ben-Hur"".  Its a fantastic read! Lots of things going on. Lewis Wallace definately has/had a definate flair for writing! Very well done!",1008288000,,235,4.7317073170731705
1337711,5,B00003OSTA,"One of few films that make me tear up. The cleansing of the lepers and Ben-Hur's realization that his Mother and Sister are healed just blows me away. One of the best films ever to be made.

1337712,5,B00003OSTA,I really love this film.  It's very good.  I highly recommend it and would give it more stars if I could.  Especially touching is the scene where Jesus gives Ben Hur a drink of water. It's a very moving film.,1007769600,,208,4.15
1337713,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur(A tale of the Christ)is in my opinion, with the possible exceptions of The Godfather and Citizen Kane, the greatest film ever made.
It won 11 Oscars so by Hollywood's own standards it is a timeless classic.
I have watched my copy so many times I think the film is starting to wear out.
This is an absolutely wonderful, uplifting film that I cannot recommend highly enough.",1006819200,,380,4.686567164179104
1337714,5,B00003OSTA,"The final invective the trampled Messala heaps on the head of Judah Ben-Hur summarizes the emptiness of revenge in this classic epic directed by William Wyler, which was the first film to win 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Judah (Charlton Heston) is a prince of the Jewish people and the childhood friend of Messala, a Roman tribune who has returned to Jerusalem to rule with an iron fist. Inevitably the two men quarrel, and Messala uses an accident as a pretext to send Judah off to the galleys as a slave and his sister and mother to the Castle Antonia to be forgotten for years. How Judah plots his revenge against Messala is the main impetus for the story. Yet while he was being herded across the desert years ago en route to the galleys, he did meet with an act of kindness when a carpenter gave him a drink of water which revived him. Although the carpenter is never seen and never speaks, the audience knows that this is Jesus. But while Judah remembers the act from time to time, he is still bent on his revenge. Through many turns of events, he achieves his freedom, encounters and returns the love of a loyal household slave, Esther, and gets his revenge at the climactic chariot race, but still he has no inner peace. It will take a supreme act of faith and a fateful meeting on the Via Dolorosa before Judah finds what he has been searching for all along.
""Ben-Hur"" is really an excellent movie, much finer than Heston's earlier ""The Ten Commandments"". Part of the reason is that the DeMille epic is played for high camp by some of the actors, while this movie is dead on serious for the whole three hours. Another reason is that Heston does much beter acting here, displaying a fuller range of emotions than he had in ""TTC"". Kudos as well to the beautiful actress playing Esther, who brings dignity and grace to her role. Her outstanding performance shows up the other two women in the show, Judah's mother and sister, who are weak actresses: a pity that these pivotal roles should not have been cast with greater care. However, the strength of the other stars carries the movie notwithstanding that.
""Ben-Hur"" earns its reputation as a spectacle with its exceptional chariot race. I heard that the great Russian composer Igor Stravinsky sat through the movie several times, just to see the chariot race over and over! Well, who can blame him. It's one of the most thrilling segments ever captured on film. Outstanding camera work and courageous stuntwork were hand in hand on this one.
When I was a kid, ""Ben-Hur"" lasted a full week on ""The 4:30 Movie"" because of its length. Today with VCRs and such, you can take it in during one big night--and I suggest you do so as soon as you have that opportunity.",1006646400,,2739,4.569105691056911
1337715,5,B00003OSTA,"Recently, I watched Ben-Hur for my first time on DVD The movie got off to a slow start and there are quite a few minutes I would have considered editing out (The overture alone is six minutes). But, after about half and hour or so, this movie really got going. The story revolves around Jonah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince who is arrested for attempting to murder a roman governor (Which was untrue. It was a mere accident) and forced into slavery. Ben-Hur is portrayed in an Academy Award winning performance by Charlton Heston. Some critics have complained in the years following the film's release that Heston is wooden in his role. While his performance isn't brilliant and does have some poor moments, he is excellent nonetheless. The rest of the cast is also good. The sets, cinematography and special effects are also excellent, which is probably why they won among the film's Eleven Academy Awards, a tally that wouldn't be equaled until 1997's Titanic.
I though at first that the opening scene of the film (The birth of Jesus Christ) had nothing to do with the movie. But Jesus was a main part in Ben-Hur's life, at least in his Hollywood life. He encouraged him to continue moving on when Jonah was a slave and also baptized him. When Jesus was dying at the cross, he performed one last miracle on the Hur family by curing Jonah's mother and sister of leprosy.
There is in this movie what is among the ten most celebrated action scenes in motion pictures: The chariot race. After more than forty years, the sequence has not lost its original excitement and is still inspiring directors today (See the pod race in Star Wars Episode One). What makes it so good is the way it was filmed. Sometimes, the camera angle makes it look as if we are spectators at the race. In other shots, we are chasing the chariots or even feel as though we are sitting in the driver's chair. The fact it was filmed in the 1950's before such a scene could be computer generated or filmed in front of a blue screen makes us appreciate it more because of the risks the producers took in filming it. Would such a scene be as great and realistic if filmed today?
The presentation on the DVD is Widescreen Anamorphic. The transfer is excellent with hardly any nicks or scratches. The extras are even more excellent. There is a superb documentary about the making of Ben-Hur, covering the book, stage productions, the 1907 short, the 1926 silent movies and of course the much celebrated 1959 movie. This documentary also shows revealing look at the making of the movie, exposing secrets of some of the special effects (One interesting tidbit: William Wyler, who directed the 1959 Ben-Hur, was an assistant director on the 1926 silent version).  There are also two theatrical trailers, screen tests and commentary from star Charlton Heston. The only major complaint I have is how you have to turn the disc over during the playing of the movie after the intermission to watch the rest of it. Taking the disc out of the box is also difficult as well.
Three-hour epics such as Ben-Hur are what can be considered an acquired taste. They are long and slow at times and often with unnecessary scenes. But this doesn't mean they aren't worth watching. If you want to learn about the Roman Empire or if you just feel like watching a good movie, Ben-Hur is highly recommended.",1005782400,,3341,4.643581081081081
1337716,5,B00003OSTA,"One of the greatest movies of all time, deserving of it's accolades, it shows the true story of Christ, though it never actually shows his face, and he appears only as a supporting actor in three scenes. One of the few Hollywood, mass-market films to portray Christians in a good light- an interesting movie to see on those unique historical grounds alone, before all the Christians die out. Great writing, directing, acting- see one scene where Ben-Hur is dying of thirst, and receives water. There are many great directing scenes, such as the use of action to show the intimacy yet violence inherent in Ben-Hur's relationship with his friend, when they first meet up and throw spears. So many films have alluded to different scenes in this (including car commercials) it is good to see in order to understand later cinematography.",1005091200,,832,4.907801418439717
1337717,5,B00003OSTA,"This is the best action-drama-religious-collossal movie I have ever watched! Considering the year it was made, it is considered as the best movie of the 20th century.
It certainly did't use CG. The background was painted by artists and the real movie set was only a part of it (mainly the foreground). All were composed and the result is the grandeur of the Roman empire. It was emphazised in the tribune set and especially, the horse racing set, which has stunned me the most.
The story was set in the first Century, begun at Christ's birth and ended by His crucifixion. The main character was a young man named Juda Ben Hur (Charlton Heston), a Jewish leader, and as a respected member of his tribe, he had a Roman bestfriend from childhood, Messala (Stephen Boyd), who was really eager to be Romans 'general'. The friendship was beginning to crack by their own perspectives and soon turned into enemies when Romans wanted to empower its reign over Juda's territory because there was a rumour about the Son of God, Jesus Christ.

1337728,5,B00003OSTA,"The theme of ""Ben Hur"" is:""Presentation and dramatization of the dichotomy regarding the nature of the Christian concept of the Kingdom of God,the ultimate purpose behind the coming of Jesus Christ and the means by which the Kingdom of God can be established on Earth.""

The jist of the plot,or the plot-theme is:""The story of a man who is a victim of injustice of the Romans and consequently,filled with growing hatred,bitterness and vengeance,seeks to overthrow the Roman empire by waging war with the much-awaited Messiah,or the Son of God-and establish the Kingdom of God on Earth.""
The dichotomy is this : one view is that the Kingdom of God is a political concept-which will replace the mighty Roman Empire-and that war and bloodshed will establish it.
On the contrary,the truth (the other side of the dichotomy) is that the Kingdom of God is a purely spiritual concept and that it can be established on Earth only through love,faith and good works.
It is difficult to decide who is the protagonist-Jesus Christ or Ben Hur.
Since Wallace's objective was to clarify the meaning behind the coming of Christ,we may say that Christ is the protagonist-though not many pages have been devoted to Him.

Ben Hur represents the erroneous side of the dichotomy. It is through his role we are made to understand what actually IS the Kingdom of God and what means can make it possible.
The story primarily deals with WHY Ben Hur follows the wrong path(how he is blinded by a strong sense of hatred and vindictiveness).
Laudable is the literary skill with which the story of Ben Hur has been inextricably interwoven with the life of Christ to bring out the purpose of the novel.

The dominating element in the novel is the heightened sense of suspense. Besides making it an action-packed thriller where events suceed each other with amazing rapidity,Wallace has infused into every chapter a stong element of suspense-from the very first to the very last.
Despite the neck-breaking speed with which the story proceeds,one never feels that the novelist has compromised on delineation of his characters' motives or psychology or the explanation of their actions or the events.
Another merit is the brilliant language. Without being over-detailed,vaguely metaphorical or losing track of the plot,Wallace's descriptions are characterised by an evaluative vividness,lucidity,clarity and charming poetry.
They do not,as in the case of many other novels take away from the story its tautness.
""Ben Hur"" has it all-a tight,taut,economized plot-structure;thrilling,suspenseful action;historical and religious value;a wide cast of inspiring,lovable heroic characters;an enthralling sense of drama and a rich,poetic style of writing.

The great sea battle and the famed chariot race are (unsurprisingly) two of my favorite scenes.  The film is presented in its super-wide MGM Camera 65 aspect ratio, and the transfer looks beautiful.  The colors are deep and rich, the picture virtually free of blemishes (except for two or three instances of a dropped frame).  Rozsa's beautiful music also shines through in a lovely 5.1 channel track.
The one danger, however, is in letting this splendid DVD lead viewers into thinking that this film has been fully restored, like _Lawrence of Arabia_.  As Robert Harris said in an interview, a DVD transfer can be made to look pristine, even though the film itself may be in terrible condition.  I sincerely hope this is not the case with _Ben Hur_, and if this is the unfortunate case, I urge that it be fully restored so that future generations can enjoy it in its original form and not only in a digital format.",997833600,,1068,4.684491978609626

The finest example of Wyler's work is on display in the new -- perhaps perfect -- iteration of the classic 1959 multi-Oscar winning Best Picture now in a stunning, meticulously restored Blu-ray transfer.

By 1957, the production was the biggest, most expensive film ever and MGM's future was riding on it. In today's dollars, the cost would be more than $250 million.

As the story goes, Civil War General Lew Wallace made a bet on a train that he could write a novel that would forever destroy the divinity of Jesus Christ.  But when his research and imagination delved into the harsh Roman world of 1st Century Palestine, something entirely unexpected emerged in his melodramatic tale of a Jewish prince on the road to revenge who crosses paths with the lowly carpenter from Nazareth.

William Wyler was an assistant director on the 1925 silent film version of Wallace's novel.  When he got the job of directing the 1959 remake, he said he wanted to ""out De Mille De Mille and who better than a Jew to tell the story of another Jew?""  When Academy Award time rolled around, the epic film garnered 11 Oscars (the most for any film and a tie with TITANIC) including Best Picture, Best Director and a Best Actor nod for Charlton Heston.

I met Heston several times socially and liked him very much.  He struck me as a surprisingly friendly and humble man who truly loved the process of acting as well as the creative collaboration of film production.  Clearly, he grasped the larger social and political import of the historical characters he often played.  It's hard to imagine any other actor better suited to the role of the wronged Judean Prince.  Heston, often derided for his strong stance on gun ownership and conservative politics, was one of the first celebrities to offer his face and name in the 60's struggle for equal rights.

The Blu-ray transfer (on two discs) of this Ultra Panavision 65 widescreen (2.76:1 aspect ratio!) wonder is as good as it gets.  This film has been meticulously restored (frame by frame) in a breathtaking transfer.  The chariot race, the finest sustained action sequence ever with a sound mix created from 53 separate audio tracks, is an incredible aural experience on this ultimate version.  The new Blu-ray version is truly startling in it's detail and rich tapestry of nuanced colors.  The Special Edition includes a replica of the journal (and sketches) Heston made during the landmark film's production and it is a fascinating read.  In a commentary track, Heston narrates some revealing moments.  He says when he was required to do a simple jump down stone steps, it suddenly reminded him of a recurring nightmare of a similar setting.  Wyler noticed something was wrong.  But when Heston did the jump, his dream disappeared.  There's also an interesting new feature-length documentary on Heston and his family life during production as well as a nice-looking disc with the original 1925 silent version of this truly majestic and epic story of revenge and redemption.",993686400,,3336,4.907308377896613

In all, this was a good book with well developed characters and good action; but while I was reading it I kept having images of Charlton Heston (who played Ben Hur in the popular movie) pop into my mind and generally ruin the scene. The other thing I didn't really like about this book is its portrayal of the cruxifiction of Jesus; but you'll just have to read it yourself.  I have read most of the religous accounts of the time and this one takes a few liberties, and I had a hard time determining exactly what was happening at times.

My favorite scene in the whole movie is when Ben Hur, while being force marched through the scorching desert heat, ends up in Nazareth. Ben Hur is on the verge of total despair due to his unquenched thirst. He watches the Roman officers, their horses, and other prisoners being given water to drink while he is refused water by one of the officers. He collapses upon the ground and you see in his face that all hope is gone, and then all of a sudden you see someone come over to him and pour cool water on his head and begin to give him water to drink. The Roman officer who had forbidden anyone to give him water sees this person attending to Ben Hur's thirst and he barks out a command towards the person giving the water, at this time the man stands up without saying a word and looks the Roman officer in the eyes (in this scene you never see the face of the Ben Hur's helper), and you can tell by the complete change of the officer's face that he has looked into the eyes of one who, by all appearances is a poor man, and yet trancedently superior to him. Of course, the compassionate person who helps Ben Hur at his greatest time of need is Christ Jesus the Lord. There are many other powerful scenes, but this one I believe is the best.",988588800,,1383,4.1835205992509366
1337763,5,B00003OSTA,"Watching the beautiful restoration of ""Ben Hur"" on DVD makes you appreciate like never before just how much we've lost with the passage of years. During the 50s and 60s, these big spectacles of ancient Rome, Egypt, etc. were taken for granted. We all went to see them, loved them, and that was that. Now, everything is computerized, the story's are nothing, the cast are forgettable (quick, can anyone remember the name of the actress who portrayed Cleopatra in the TV mini-series?) The extras on the Ben Hur DVD can entrance you for hours or, if you're like me, you like to spread it over several days. One complaint: there's much too much time devoted to author Gore Vidal in the documentary on the making of Ben Hur. Vidal goes on and on, ad nauseum, about how he was forced to work on the script (yeah, sure, Gore, I mean, after all this was only MGM, the greatest studio in the world at that time)and how he agreed if only they would end his two-year contract. Oh, pu-leeze! Ego, thy name is Gore. One more minor quibble is that the color restoration for Ben Hur isn't as rich and vibrant as on the 5-star DVD version of ""Cleopatra"", another masterpiece that has finally been brought back to show a new generation of movie buffs what Hollywood used to do several times a year. Miklos Roza's scroe is beautiful. When there was a cast of hundreds, that really meant a cast of hundreds of human beings, and not computerized blurs. Now, if only someone would bring us the Five Star edition of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" to join these marvelous spectacles like Ben Hur, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, Cleopatra, etc.",988588800,,1631,4.589041095890411

1337765,5,B00003OSTA,"The epic BEN-HUR characterises the acintillating deep focus of emotional expression while the movie has been remarkably dramatised by the Great Director ""William Wyler"". It can easily be regarded as the best and most honoured motion picture of all times.
BEN-HUR depicts most subtle human values, sentiments and the fighting spirit as displayed during times of turmoil and upheaval.
It was picturised in 1958 and the story relates to a period two thousand years back in time, however the viewers will never loose its captivating and spellbinding appeal which circumvents mankinds quintessential values, namely, hope and misery, faith and tyrrany, love and hatred, humily and cruelty, forbearance and revenge, power and morals and disease and death.
The immense scope of BEN-HUR can never be under-rated, although it requires a deep insight for a keen eye to explore a most intricate play of historical drama depicted in this biblical epic.",988416000,,939,5.308724832214765

1337767,5,B00003OSTA,"""Ben-Hur"" tells many stories which weave into one another to create the most gorgeous Biblical epic of our time, vividly retelling the story of the time in which Christ lived and died. These events are seen through the eyes of Judah Ben-Hur, the title character whose interaction with the unrest and confusion of these times becomes a sumptuous and highly emotional human drama from which I was unable to hold back tears. The movie's grand scale and moving storytelling, under the superb direction of William Wyler, are just the icing on this multi-faceted an breathtaking view of the time of Jesus.
Our main character, Judah Ben-Hur, is deeply unsettled by the intent of the Romans to take over the small town of Judea and convert its Jewish citizens into Roman citizens, which would mean their swearing of allegiance and worship to the Emporer of Rome. His unrest is further complicated by his friendship with the tribune of the Roman Army, Messala, whom he has known since childhood. Messala hopes he can rely on Judah's support, and that his friend's influence will make for an easier transition, while the armies of the Roman empire begin filling up the city.
Through sheer fate, an accident involving Judah and the new governor lands he and his family, his mother Mirriam and sister Tirzah, in the Roman prison, where Messala, who was earlier spurned by Judah in his request for support, sentences Judah to the galleys, with fates unknown for his family. Judah is forced to leave behind his family, his home, and a budding romance with his former servant Hester, with whom he visited before his arrest. His experiences in the galleys will lead him to become the adopted son of a council, a formidable rival against his nemesis in a grueling chariot race, and a strong and bold man whose devotion to his family and his love for Esther will drive him to survive any situation.
The fictional aspect of this story is set against the life of Christ, which begins the movie in a glorious opening depicting His birth. We are given a small glimpse of the Three Wisemen, who will appear later in the film to interact with Judah in his return to Judea. Judah will also come to see Christ face-to-face on numerous occasions, providing us a small glimpse of the power He held over people and the good deeds he gave unto them. On a small side note, I particularly liked the way in which Christ's is never seen, adding an air of mystery to a man whose life is enshrouded in it.
The history and the fiction never outweigh one another, but instead have a special way of working with one another so that we become enamored by both. Judah's experiences with Christ will further lead to his will to survive, and his segue from hardened feelings of hatred for his enemies to love for all those around him. The inevitable crucifiction, which comes in the last half hour, is a mesmerizing experience which will show the death of Christ as well as the cleansing of the world's impurities through the healing of Judah's mother and sister, who were stricken with leprocy while in prison. And the Roman empire is seen a magnificent light, especially once Judah is accepted into their circles when he saves the council's life.
Human depth and emotion is also very important to this epic, and it achieves this aspect in every way possible. The relationship between Judah and his family is intensified by his fight to survive in hopes that he might, one day, be able to free them again. Once stricken with the shamed disease, the two women decide never to see him again, allowing him to think them dead. Their decision is utterly gutwrenching, so don't try holding back tears. The romance between Judah and Esther shows not only their love but their hardships and troubles, which makes it all the more convincing and enticing to watch. The interaction between Judah and Messala is intense and provides much of the movie's conflicts, and we must question why Messala would do such things to an old friend. We can relate to these characters on many levels, which allows us to identify with the movie itself.
Director William Wyler sought out to make an epic out of this story, and his success in achieving this goal is spectacular and marvelous to look at. The movie's 300 grand and ominous set designs contribute to the vast and perplexing beauty of this period in time, while luxurious costumes, which were reported to be in excess of over 100,000 outfits for 8,000 extras, are meticulous and exact in detail and authenticity. The need for action is also present, which is met with a splendid sequence aboard a Roman sea vessel, which leads to a water battle, and the ever-popular chariot race which set a new standard in movie special effects in its day. To this day, this scene is intense and overflows with suspense, even when watched more than once. Music is also important, overflowing with sadness and uplifting chords which all sweep us into the movie's high-level emotion.
The cast is extremely likeable and easy on the eyes, while giving us performances that breach the limits of human depth. Charlton Heston, who played Moses in another Biblical epic, really outdoes himself here with this role, bringing out all of Judah Ben-Hur's emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Here is a very complex character whose interactions with his surroundings change his life in new and unforeseen ways, perhaps the most complex movie character in history. His nemesis, Messala, is played masterfully by Stephen Boyd, who makes Messala a perfectly crafty, pompous and deceptive enemy to match Judah. Esther is portrayed by Haya Harareet, who is subtly enticing, allowing her deep wisdom and powerful insight into Judah's actions and mind to shine through her intense physical beauty. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell are Mirriam and Tirzah, on whom a major portion of the emotional depth relies on. Their performances are extremely moving and deep, as is the rest of this fabulous ensemble cast.
Being one of the most incredible epics ever put to the screen, ""Ben-Hur"" defies all the obstacles and comes out unflawed. The story has everything going for it, and it meets all its goals through its dramatic storytelling, its powerhouse performances and epic scale and grandeur. I love movies like this, which continue to impress after multiple viewings, while also reaching for the heart and giving it a nice emotional tug. Judah is a hero for the ages, embodying everything we want in a character whose survival we wish for.",988070400,,6493,4.824215246636771
1337778,5,B00003OSTA,"Everyone knows that Ben-Hur is one of the greatest epic films of all time.  The story is timeless, the acting is strong, direction is visionary, and the score is appropriately elegant.  Many people have recently compared Gladiator to Ben-Hur and rightfully so.  As you watch Ben-Hur, you will realize that many of the key plot points and twists match Gladiator's.  Watch the chariot scene that still grips you today, and you think of The Phantom Menace's pod racing scene.  Keep in mind that the story of Ben-Hur originates in the 19th century.  That's how timeless and great this story is, in that movies winning Best Picture Oscars today still employ Ben-Hur's story points.
As for the DVD, one will not be disappointed.  They got the widescreen format perfectly proportioned to the original showing which used rare cameras to catch panoramic shots not seen today.  This is a must if you want to watch Ben-Hur.  If you get the chance, watch a pan-and-scan version of Ben-Hur and this DVD version.  You'll not only notice the better picture/sound but also the amount of picture you miss with pan-and-scan.  The difference is astonishing, and you'll wonder why you tolerated such a deprivation.
The special features on the DVD are in abundance and it's appropriate for a movie of such history.  There is a Charlton Heston commentary, a making of documentary (in depth and intriguing especially when discussing the chariot scene,) photo gallery, and that rare screen test featuring The Naked Gun star, Leslie Nielson as Messala.  Experience Ben-Hur properly with this DVD and see where most movies today get their ideas.",987984000,,1619,4.996268656716418
1337779,5,B00003OSTA,"In the late 1950's MGM was in trouble financially.  They desperately needed a hit that would put the studio back in the black and re-establish it as a major player.  They decided to bet the ranch on Ben-Hur.  They brought in William Wyler (""Wuthering Heights"", ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", ""Roman Holiday"") to direct and gave him carte blanche to spend whatever it took to make the film successful.  The result was the most expensive film made to that date at $50 Million (equivalent to $300 Million in today's dollars).  Many of the sets took over a year to build.
It was lucky the film ever was finished at all.  After six months in production, they still didn't have a cast and the script by Karl Tunberg was deemed unacceptable by Wyler.  Wyler brought in Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson (""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Death Takes a Holiday"", ""Key Largo"") to rewrite the screenplay and they frequently were doing desperate rewrites the night before shooting.  Producer Sam Zimbalist died during production.  The roman ships they built for the naval battle were top heavy and capsized, so they had to build a special tank where the ships were guided by wires and held upright.  An expensive 65mm camera was destroyed in a collision with a chariot.
Numerous leading men were reported to have turned down the part of Ben-Hur, most notably Paul Newman, who said he didn't have the legs to appear in a tunic.  Others who were considered were Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas.  Wyler couldn't find the right actor for the lead, so he turned to Charlton Heston, with whom he had done the film ""The Big Country"", the year before.  Heston accepted the part and the rest is history.
Despite all its production problems, the film is brilliantly done and stands as an archetype of film epics.  The sets and costumes are glorious, the direction superb and the acting compelling.  The chariot race is an outstanding orchestration of set construction, stunt work and filming that is superlative even by today's standards.  Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did almost all their own chariot driving, using stuntmen for only the most dangerous stunts.  This lent greater realism to the scenes, allowing more close-ups during the intense action.
Somehow, despite all the rewrites using three different writers, the story flowed smoothly to its final resolution.  The bitter rivalry between Judah and Messala, boyhood friends turned enemies by Messala's ambition, is well conceived and creates a sense of purpose that makes the ultimate confrontation as powerful as it is inevitable.
The entire cast is terrific.  Charlton Heston gives a career performance as Judah Ben-Hur.  His combination of strength, courage, compassion and perseverance creates an attractive and heroic character that few in film history have been able to equal.  Stephen Boyd is also fantastic as Messala, with a ruthless ambition and a cold heart that stamps out lifelong friendships for personal gain.  Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith lead a wonderful supporting cast.
This film is one of the most honored epics ever made.  It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 11 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), and Best Music.  It is number 72 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  The chariot race is one of the most exciting sequences ever filmed.  I rated it a 10/10.

1337781,4,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur is one of the greatest films of all time, winning 11 Academy Awards, including the award for best film of 1959.  It should have had a better DVD treatment.  Instead of using two discs, the movie is put on two sides of the same disc.  That is too bad, and smacks of cheapness.  By Comparison, Cleopatra, a less accomplished film, was put on two discs, with a third disc with bonus material thrown in for good measure.  (And for about the same price.)  The two-sided format will not bode well for long-term durability.
The master film that the DVD was made from does not seem to be restored footage, and some of it shows wear.  There are many dark places on the film, and DVD generally does not do well with dark screen areas, including those on this disc.  (It should be noted that the DVD of ""Spartacus"" had the same problem, and that was made from a restored master).  On one occasion, my player had difficulty reading one of the sides; I'm not sure why.  The widescreen version wastes a large amount of screen real estate in an attempt to preserve as much of the aspect ratio as possible, given the super-wide 70 millimeter Panavision process that the movie was shot in.

1337798,5,B00003OSTA,"Just as we ""Young Un`s"" lined up to awe at Ridley Scott`s and Russell Crowe`s virtual epic tour of the Roman world in ""Gladiator"", it`s sometimes hard to imagine that our own parents (or even great-grandparents in that matter) lined up to awe at epic visions they shall always call their own.  William Wyler`s and Charton Heston`s ""Ben-Hur"" delivered these visions and even more.  This film, complete with physical struggle and emotional anguish, blended with eternal themes of personal retribution and divine redemption, proves that even a forty year old film can carry the same compelling messages and visions without the aid of digital reality.  At times, I found this film to surpass ""Gladiator"" on many sides.  I`ll be quite blunt about it, Stephen Boyd`s Massala was a more vicious opponent to Judah Ben-Hur than Joaquin Phoenix`s Commodus was to Maximus.  Sure, Commodus showed no mercy as he swiftly swiped Maximus`s identity away from the Roman sphere of power after Maximus defied his claim to power, but Massala took a more deliberate act of personal retribution to vanquish his blood brother`s standing in Judea, illustating Massala`s stern allegiance to the Roman Way.  Yes, the acting is a bit theatric at times and there is a very overt religious message attached, but if you watch ""Ben-Hur"" closely you will understand how well constructed these parallels are.  As far as the Chariot spectacle goes, sorry Ridley, but this  scene shall always be film`s greatest tribute to Rome`s ancient glory.  The organic vitality of this scene is simply unmatched in speed, fury, and urgency, and its surprising outcome will leave you shocked!  Clearly, you will be at a loss if you don`t experienece ""Ben-Hur"", not only as a source of inspiration for our own epics, but also as a glimpse into the spectacles and values our older family members saw and learned from.  The DVD is a complete evening of entertainment, really!  Take time to notice the subleties of the color and sound.  Later, relish the outstanding documentary film about this production.  If you watch and listen very closely, you might notice that they never needed a computer to accomplish some very convincing illusions of size ans splendor, but that`s just movie magic for you, it inspires generation after generation, as this film always will.  Watch ""Ben-Hur"", enjoy it with your family.  And hey, do watch it side to side with ""Gladiator"" and notice their similarities, their differences and their wonder.

Ben-Hur won 11 Oscar's in 1959 including the ""Big 3"", Picture, Director - William Wyler and Actor - Charleton Heston.
This widescreen digitally restored picture & full sound (stereoized) DVD version is an absolute joy to watch & listen to.
The cast was meticulously casted and proved to be the right combination to provide the drama for ""General Lew Wallace's"" epic story.
In summary; This story parallels the ""The Story of the Christ"" Wallaces actual book title of this tale.
The setting is a Roman conquered and imprisoned Judah.  There is unrest & possible rebellion in the air. Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) a Jewish Prince and grown childhood friend Roman Centurian Messala (Stephen Boyd) clash with different adult views. Shortly after their falling out a serious accident occurs involving the new Roman Governor & the Hur family. Due to this accident Ben-Hur is arrested & sentenced to be Galley (slave) rower & his family is imprisoned to keep this possible rebellion from occuring. Hur promises he will return and seek Messala with a vengence.
The movie is a long interesting journey (over 3 hours)of Hur and Christ.  Their paths crossing at key times in each ones life.  The Sea Battle and the most famous & spectacluar 11 minute chariot race highlights this greatest of tales.

1337802,5,B00003OSTA,"William Wyler's Ben-Hur is actually the third version of the film to appear.  It was first done as a silent film, then remade in the 1920's and then tackled in this epic version.  The film literally employed a cast of thousands and at the time of its release in 1959 was a technical marvel.  Forty years later the film still stands up and the DVD version perfectly captures the grandeur of the film.  The chariot race is one of the most famous scenes in movie history and despite all the technological advances has yet to be duplicated or surpassed.  Charlton Heston won his only Oscar in the title role and he's at his bombastic, self-righteous and over-emoting best.  Jack Hawkins is excellent as his one-time best friend turned rival and Hugh Griffith is delightful as the sheik who supplies Ben Hur with the horses for the chariot race.  Mr. Griffith also won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor and Mr. Wyler won his third Best Director award as the film went on to win an unprecedented 11 awards (including Best Picture).  That was record that stood until 1997 when Titanic matched it.  One complaint about an otherwise superb DVD release is that instead of putting the almost four hour film along with all the extra material onto two disks, they made one double-sided disk.  The lettering distinguishing the two sides is extremely small and difficult to figure out and it is a nuisance to get up during the film to flip the disk over.",985132800,,1439,4.6299212598425195

I watched this scene three times since I bought this dvd.  However, there is so much more to Ben Hur than the chariot race.  Wthout giving away any specific scenes, this is a story of how God can influence one's life.  This is the most important reason why I would highly recommend investing in this dvd. The picture quality of this dvd is excellent.  The extras are very informative, especially Charlton Heston's commentary.  The commentary on this dvd has a unique option.  An icon appears on the screen when it is time to proceed to the next scene containing commentary.  In other words, you do not have to sit through the entire film to enjoy the commentary.

THe stupidity lies in Warner Brothers inability to dual layer the DVDs or at least break the film into two discs, one for the film and the other for the Special Features... such as Fight Club, etc. This would eliminate the need to switch the disc over during the intermission.
However, this is not such a problem, since their is an intermission in the movie. if this were a shorter film (like what WB did to Stargate) it would be appalling and horrible to destroy the movie's continuity by having to flip it.... but its ok and you should buy the DVD anyway.

The sound is absolutely sensational and full credits must be given to the tehnicians that converted the original mono soundtrack into wonderful 5.1 digital sound. The music of Ben-Hur is just one of its strong points and the 5.1 sound on this DVD makes the best movie of all time even better. The bonus material included on the single DVD is really outstanding.

1337806,5,B00003OSTA,"Ben-Hur
Score: 95/100
If you haven't seen it, or at least not heard about it, where have you been for the past century? Ben-Hur is one of the most globally acclaimed films of our time, and it won a record-shattering 11 Oscar's! It's hard to fault this classic, and if you have not yet seen it, go and do so now and thank me later.
Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) lives as a rich Jewish prince and merchant in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 1st century. Together with the new governor his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives as commanding officer of the Roman legions. At first they are happy to meet after a long time but their different politic views separate them. During the welcome parade a brick falls down from Judah's house and barely misses the governor. Although Messala knows that they are not guilty he sends Judah to the galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. But Judah swears to come back and take revenge.
Ben-Hur is an endlessly indulgent and involving movie that gets more famous, more brilliant every time you watch it. There is not a fault in the acting: Charlton Heston pulls off a legendary turn as Ben-Hur, winning himself an Oscar, and Stephen Boyd captures the evil nature of his comedy and really makes you hate his character, but not his acting skill. William Wyler's focused direction and Karl Tunberg's script only make it more recommendable, while the thunderous score, delicious set design and breathtaking cinematography make this film non-stop entertaining until the exhilirating last acts.
Absorbing, excellent and cinematically brilliant, Ben-Hur is the masterpiece that has changed cinema history forever. It is quite simply one of the finest epic movies that has been bought to our screen.",984787200,,1748,4.888888888888889

Charlton Heston in his finest role as a Jewish prince wrongly imprisoned along with his mother and sister and his subsequent, miraculous adventures on the high seas, in Rome, and back in Judea.  However wooden Heston may have been in some of his roles, not so here, he is wonderfully human even if some of his one liners are a bit clipped.  Stephen Boyd is magnificent and chilling as his boyhood friend and Roman antagonist.  The climactic chariot race between Heston, racing for Judea with a team of white horses owned by an Arab sheik, and Boyd, racing for Rome with his team of black horses, is one of the very few greatest scenes ever filmed, one can scarely breathe even if one has seen it a dozen times.  Wonderful supporting acting throughout, and of course the story is all the more profound because ultimately it is a tale of the rise and death of Christ, woven into the plot ever so gracefully and subtly, and ending on a beautiful note of redemption and peace.  They don't make em like this any more.  Absolutely compelling and mandatory.",984700800,,1131,4.597014925373134

The rest of the movie took a little while to get use to because of the overacting(compared to acting styles of today).

1337819,5,B00003OSTA,"When James Cameron accepted ""Titanic""'s 11th Oscar with the words ""Ben Who?""  the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should have risen as one and pelted him with copies of ""Ben Hur"".  Unfortunately it was the Academy who handed him the Best Picture Oscar that year (for reasons known only to themselves).
""Ben Hur"" -- one of the greatest movies ever made -- consists of three and a half hours of highlights and two minutes of exposition.  It is so well constructed -- it's story so well told -- that time flies by.  At the same time, one feels one has experienced the struggles of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston's best performance).
The wonderful moments are too numerous to mention:  A customer stopping by Joseph's carpentry shop and inquiring after Joseph's negligent son; Joseph calmly replies that his son -- Jesus, of course -- is off walking in the hills (communing with His Father Who Art in Heaven).  Reviews of ""Gladiator"" -- contrasting Ben-Hur's repeated references to Christianity with ""Gladiator""'s non-mention of it -- failed to note that the subtitle of the book Ben-Hur is based on is ""A Tale of the Christ"".
Or when Judah meets up with a man who breeds and trains chariot race horses, especially the scene where the beautiful white horses arrive in the tent to ""say good night.""
Or Judah speaking to Esther on the roof of his house -- a wonderful scene of love and restraint (i.e., sexual tension).
This film has everything:  A tender love story; humour; friendship; action; revenge -- one might think we were discussing ""The Princess Bride"".

If I was told I could only have one movie to take with me on a desert island, in space, etc. this would have to be it. As so many people have said it's the compilation of so many things that make it outstanding. The acting is super. No doubt in my mind this was Hestons best work. The effects have aged well. I dare anyone to find fault with a chariot race or a sea battle for that matter that even today make us believe they could have been filmed as they occured in ancient Roman times. Althouth I love the music from Gladiator, Star Wars, and others I still think that more emotions are touched by Ben Hur's musical score. I have to assume we are telling you kids to see this because any adult that has not seen it and loved it had to be on an island with no TVs for about 40 years.",984009600,,879,3.9717514124293785

Forget the acting;  forget the excitement;  forget everything about this film except the music,  and you still have the best that has ever been created.  Miklos Rozsa's score stands, in my opinion, as the most sensational achievement ever in film history.  and that's just the beginning.  The color, the costumes, the flawless direction of Mr. Wyler as many have alluded to, drew once-in-a-lifetime performances out of the entire cast.  When I was a senior in high school, my girl and I double- dated with another couple and we saw this movie.  As soon as the opening fanfare caught my attention, I was hopelessly hooked.  I have owned the music for this movie for over forty years.  It is something I have never tired of.  There is something new in the score each time I listen to it.  It, like the film itself, is timeless.  And I agree with others that Titanic, while it is a nice expensively-done film, cannot match the majesty of Ben-Hur for its marvelous sequences that offered little in the way of special effects.  The Chariot Race alone is worth the price of admission.  I have given this movie the five stars only because that's all that is allowed.",983750400,,1304,4.6
1337822,5,B00003OSTA,"This film when it was released in 1959 saw it's studio MGM teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and the fact that this film cost in 1958 close to $15 Million dollars was most assuredly a make or break film for the studio.
William Wyler the film's director, in order to make this film unique as if a running time close to four hours was not enough, filmed it in an aspect ratio of 2.76:1 using what was called MGM Camera 65, an Ultra Panavision process.
This film was one of only two films that were filmed in that process which is the widest of processes used in film to date.
Filmed utilizing 8000 extras, 300 sets, and over 100,000 costume changes this film epitomizes the word grand and released  a few years after the Ten Commandments, it helped quench the public thirst for Biblical films.
This new DVD release is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and the LFE channel(Low Frequency Effects) is apparent on two standout scenes, the Sea Battle scene, and the now infamous chariot scene which last close to 11 minutes.
There are quite a few special features on this DVD release most of which appear on side two of this disc including a documentary, Ben Hur: The Making Of An Epic, which is just under an hour long.
There was an open casting call for the lead role in this film and they have included on this DVD the original screen tests by Leslie Nielsen, and Cesare Danova which are interesting to see even though the quality of the audio and video are not up to the level of the film itself.
Also included are storyboard art and posters as well as film biographies of the cast with pictures of them in character from the film.
Overall this film is an incredible piece of work and presented in it's original aspect ratio with the enhanced sound combines to make an experience that should not be missed.
This film on the small screen does lose a little bit of it's lustre especially if your television is under 27 inches in size but this film begs to be seen in it's broad presentation, so even if you would normally shy away from widescreen presentations, this is the only way to view this film in my honest opinion.

1337850,3,B00003OSTA,"In 1880 Union General Lew Wallace was stationed at a Western outpost when he began writing Ben Hur to dispel the boredom of his job. General Wallace who fought in some of the major campaigns of the Civil War was also questioning the meaning of his faith when the novel was written.
There are few who do not know the basic premise of this novel and fewer still who have not seen the monumental MGM film based on it. This story chronicles the life of Judah Ben Hur and his desire for revenge against the Roman Messala and all of Rome for the wrongs done him and his family.
In plot the story is simple enough. Ben Hur has been wrongly convicted of an attempt to kill the Roman Governor of Judea and sentenced to death on the Roman galleys. His fortune has been stolen and his family locked away in a dungeon. Ben Hur survives the galleys and defeats his enemy in the now famous chariot race at the Circus at Antioch.
If this were the end of Wallace's story we would have been left with a decent story of revenge and nothing more. However, Wallace incorporates into his story (bookends it really) with the story of the Passion of Jesus.
Wallace uses the coming of Jesus to examine the issues of his own faith. To analyze the dual nature of Jesus as King and Redeemer. To Ben Hur and the fiercely nationalist Jews of his time the world was waiting for a King to come to overthrow the power of Rome. Ben Hur sees this king as an element of his revenge against Rome and uses his restored fortune to build an army in support of the king.
By the end of the novel Ben Hur realizes that the King was not to come to overthrow Rome but to be a Redeemer of souls. That the kingdom to be created was not to be one of this world.
Wallace's narrative takes some time to get used to. It is sluggish and detail oriented. Literally everything is described. If you are looking for a fast read this book is not for you. If you are looking for a novel in the grand scale which also works as a powerful religous meditation give this one a try. The book was a great best seller when it was written and it can still be powerful 120 years later.",977875200,,2119,4.208845208845209

But ""Ben-Hur"" has a unique look to it; made in 1959 and with a budget of only $15 million, William Wyler managed to make a film that was moving and inspiring -- it definitely inspired me in many ways with my acting, directing and writing. Though Heston plays his character, Judah Ben-Hur, very wooden-like, the film stays afloat with vibrant performances by Stephen Boyd as Messala, the Roman Tribune; Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim; and Haya Harareet as Esther, Judah's love interest (though Wyler regretted putting her in the film).

1337852,5,B00003OSTA,"In one of the most unique parlays in human history, Lew Wallace was not only a significant Union  General during the Civil War, he also wrote one of the best selling novels in all of literature.  After  the war, posted to a deadly dull Western fort, Wallace began writing to fill the empty hours.  Prompted by a casual discussion about the life and times of Jesus, he set this great story of revenge  against the backdrop of Christ's mission.
Judah Ben-Hur is a Jew of Jerusalem.  Arriving at manhood, he has become estranged from his  childhood friend Messala, a Roman noble.  The two exchange bitter words and when Ben-Hur later  accidentally dislodges a roof tile which strikes a Roman official, Messala has him sent to the galleys  and his mother and sister, Tirzah, sent to a leprosy infested prison cell.  As he is being led to the ship  on which he will be enslaved, Ben-Hur is offered a drink of water by an unforgettable stranger.  Onboard ship, Ben-Hur befriends the Roman admiral Arrius and, after saving his life, is made his heir  and a citizen of Rome.
Several years later, wealthy and well educated, Ben-Hur returns to Judea to look for his mother and  sister and wreak his revenge on Messala.  Vengeance comes when he vanquishes Messala in a chariot  race, but his family, freed from their squalid cell and suffering from leprosy, hide from him.  Meanwhile, Christ has come to Jerusalem preaching to increasing crowds and Ben-Hur, recognizing  the kindly stranger who once helped him, becomes a leader of a group of armed guards bent on  protecting him.  His devotion becomes all the more complete after Christ heals Tirzah and his mother.  But when the time comes, Ben-Hur heeds Christ's wishes and does not intervene.  He does manage to  return the long ago favor and give Christ a drink and remains to bear witness to the crucifixion.  The  story concludes with the increasingly wealthy Ben-Hur using his riches to fund the catacombs of Rome  from which Christianity would emerge to conquer the Empire.
It is no mystery why this is one of the most beloved of all American novels.  The savage revenge  theme, worthy of The Count of Monte Cristo, intertwines with the story of Christ to produce a story  that is thrilling, uplifting and timeless.

1337869,5,B00003OSTA,"This is a wonderful film, which I've watched countless times. It basically focuses on the life of a peace-loving  man named Judah Ben Hur, from his unfair banishment to the galleys to the famous chariot race. When he  refuses to help his friend betray his own people he is sent to be condemned  in the galley of a battle-ship. He escapes, and from then on he goes along  a journey of love, betrayal, and hate. At last he witnesses the death of  Christ, and he finally learns to forgive and to love unconditionally. THis  film has an interesting way of telling the life of christ, all the while  showing beautiful cinematography and displays a touching message.",955670400,,660,4.637931034482759

1337872,5,B00003OSTA,"Despite forty years of bashing by cynical critics, William Wyler's Ben-Hur lives on as the archetype of epic moviemaking.  By skillfully counterbalancing the majestic with the mundane, Wyler sought to humanize  the unwieldy scale of earlier Biblical films.  And, while the gripping  chariot race is considered the hallmark of the film, it is the small, human  elements that carry the story.  Judah Ben-Hur's love for the slave, Esther;  his devotion to mother and sister and his transformation from the vengeful  slayer of Messalla to follower of Jesus on the road to crucifixion is a  heroic character saga of a type many find unfashionable in today's  world.
The film abounds with stirring dialog and memorable imagery.  Witness the cruel centurion who leads Ben-Hur and others in chains to the  galleys.  ""No water for that one!"" he commands, pointing to the bleeding  and parched Ben-Hur.  And when Jesus himself emerges to disobey the order,  the Roman stands transfixed and impotent; the camera simply pauses for a  moment and allows us to study the conflict expressed in the man's shamed  and guilt-ridden face.  This scene is a small masterpiece of deft acting  and direction.
Or Messalla, having lost the chariot race, lies crushed  and near death, awaiting the arrival of Ben-Hur.  A surgeon nervously  pushes for permission to begin an amputation of his legs. ""I won't receive  him as half a man!"" he screams.  When Judah finally arrives Messalla  gleefully recounts the fate of his mother and sister, enjoying the horror  it instills in Ben-Hur's eyes.  In a veiled and malignant reference to how  the hatred of men perpetuates itself, Masallah sputters with his last  breath: ""It goes on, Judah...  The race, it goes on...""
Though notorious as a  ""guy"" film, Ben-Hur establishes female characters in strong, defining  roles.  Mother and daughter endure degradation, imprisonment and disease,  living only for the sake of each other and the faint hope that Judah is  alive.  Released from prison, disfigured and self-banished as lepers, they  plead with Esther to convince Judah that they are dead, wishing only to be  remembered, ""as we were"".  They hobble away into the shadows, sorrowfully  locked in each other's arms, but spiritually renewed by a stolen glimpse of  Ben-Hur in the distance.  The love between Esther and Judah is a study of  restrained passion.  The scenes where Heston and Haya Harareet are together  work well, proving the axiom that good actors generate their own chemistry;  (and, for Heston, it probably didn't hurt that Harareet was a stunning  beauty.)
A warning to cultural nihilists:  religious themes abound!  This is, after all, a Biblical Epic.  Nativity and Crucifixion scenes may  remind you of those ""Illustrated Bible"" editions you might have seen in  Sunday School.  But, in the hands of director Wyler, they are splendidly  and lovingly rendered.  The Jewishness of early Christianity is never  questioned; Esther refers to Jesus as  ""...a young Rabbi,"" a pacifist and  healer who ultimately takes the sword from the hand of Ben-Hur.  Overshadowing all in Judea is the heavy fist of Imperial Rome, its  tyrannical rule driving the people to be, in the words of the departing  Tribune, ""obsessed with religion.""
As with all great movies it is the  secondary players who invite repeated viewings.  Ben-Hur has many notables  in small, vivid roles.  Two lesser known examples:  Frank Thring, as  Pontius Pilate, in a speech rich with insinuations of realpolitic, cautions  Judah against crossing the will of Rome, (""There are many small men of envy  and ambition..."").  And Wyler's decision to cast veteran actor George Relph  as Tiberius was a stroke of genius.  In marked contrast to the majesty of  his surroundings, the Divine Emperor looks rumpled and flea-bitten; more  like a neglected grandfather than the power behind the Empire.
Ben-Hur is  a sumptuous delight of lavish craftsmanship.  It cries out for a DVD  edition that gives credit to its spectacular photography as well a (justly  famous) musical score.  Ted Turner, are you listening?",951609600,,4099,5.128048780487805

1337876,4,B00003OSTA,"Wonderfully made biblical epic which I caught on a late night channel. The well known story of the judean prince Judah Ben-Hur who is sold into slavery by his best friend remains a popular one in our family now going in  to the third generation. Also as an added side interest is the pivotal but  harrowing story of Christ and the crucifixtion complete with miracles &  choral singing. Despite the deeply religious overtones it is replete with  human conflicts. Love, betrayal, faith... and a chariot race at the end to  upstage any car chase scene Bruce Willis ever did.
I was impressed with  the supporting cast especially Jack Hawkins as Ben-Hur's adopted father and  australian actor Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate. But the acting laurels  must go to Hugh Griffith,as they certainly did at the 1963 Academy  awards,for his role as Sheikh Ilderim.  A rather uncouth big-hearted but  marvellously animated owner of a chariot racing stable who loves to  gamble,hates the romans and enjoys a good fight. He is a pleasure to watch  and at times provides some comic relief in this sombre & sonorous epic.  Gore Vidal,interviewed in  ""the Celluloid Closet"" provides us  with some interesting anecdotes about the writing of the script especially  the double-edged innuendos which amazingly made it past the strict  censorship of the time. Every one seemed to have fun with it including  Stephen Boyd who plays Messala. Only Chuck Heston didn't get the joke Vidal  recalls. Perhaps his staunch republicanism would not have seen the humour  of it. Despite the sacriligious perfidy of Vidal & co it is still a  very watchable film and i recommend it to all new generations. Give it a go.  Phantom Menace has nothing on this!",947116800,,1717,4.905923344947735
1337897,5,B00003OSTA,"I think 5-stars is not enough for this great movie. I've seen this film more than 10 times and each time I see it, it makes a new impression on me.
I find Stephen Boyd's acting brilliant, not to mention Charlton  Heston's.
- Messala : ""You've no other choice. You're either for me  or against me.""
- Judah : ""If that is the choice, then I am  against you.""
  I am touched by the sequence in which the conflict  between the two old friends reaches the peak and the friendship turns into  enmity, which comes from the sad situation of the conqueror and  conquered.
I am also very much impressed by the struggling look of the  eyes of Judah's on the galley and I like the breathtaking chariot race  sequence the most as many other people do.
It's really sorrowful when  Judah meets his mother and sister in the valley of the lepers but the last  scene is lovely with a happy ending.
This film has conflict, tragedy,  victory, revenge, humour, belief, love and more in it. All of these made up  the immortal masterpiece.

1337899,5,B00003OSTA,"No other film in history is worthy of winning more Oscars or honors than this grand scale production. I bought it when I was thirteen and fell in love with it immediately as did my family. What I love is the telling of  Christ's life and how one man must come to terms with his faith and the  political uprising of Rome at her zenith of world power. I have yet to see  an epic as large and grand scale as this or as moving. The music moves me  to tears each time I hear its blissful strains blow into the air. I always  feel my eyes water whenever I hear the main theme play. We watched this  film in my Bible History class in high school and the students were awed at  the sea battle and that chariot race. Truly it is the greatest action scene  ever put to celluloid without comparison to some ship busting apart in the  frigid waters of the North Atlantic. Though this film is longer than  ""TITANIC"" it has a more human drama captured through the eyes of  a director with a heart for sheer realism, no matter what time of history  the story takes place. All film collectors should put this in a special  spot on the video shelf as there is no other film of equal magnitude or  brilliance as this. ""TITANIC"" was banal compared to the  overwhelming emotion this film evokes. The Oscars was, again, just a  popularity contest in giving it eleven Oscars and the script wasn't even  nominated and I don't blame them. The story in ""Ben-Hur"" has  better reason to be emotional and tearful, as it presents a message that  will one day make an eternal decision for all upon this earth. Charlton  Heston is outstanding as Ben-Hur and well deserved his Oscar for Best  Actor.
