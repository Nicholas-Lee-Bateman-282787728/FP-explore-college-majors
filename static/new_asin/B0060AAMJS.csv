8490225,3,B0060AAMJS,"This is a mondo documentary of the counter cultures of Australia whose whole point is to exhibit full frontal nudity in every other episode.

Sex and nudity. 3 stars for the nudity.",1424131200,,181,4.65625
8490226,5,B0060AAMJS,"I like this movie, it shows a lot about Australia, but it was mad in the sixties, or the seventies, but it is some how worth what I paid for.",1376956800,,141,3.7333333333333334
8490227,2,B0060AAMJS,"This is a documentary style dvd with a polished voice over running commentary on what's plainly seen on the screen.  It tries to ttitillate thru nude beaches, bath houses & a strip club or 2.  There's even a cult like segment.  There's also scenes of Aboriginals living in squalor & a bunch of drunk people at a festival or 2.  Think the old Art Mann Presents without the prettier people & more hair.  I'd say skip it.",1360368000,,418,4.376623376623376
