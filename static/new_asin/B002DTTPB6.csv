audio is the same:  O.K. but a bit distorted. Too bad, as this is Barry in his best
young voice.  Good as always, but not worth a premium to the original issue.",1490400000,,242,4.1063829787234045
8366003,4,B002DTTPB6,"Be careful...the picture of the Blu-Ray shows Region 0 which is compatible everywhere.
  The Amazon product description says Region B only....
  Which is it, Amazon??",1380931200,,166,5.52
8366004,5,B002DTTPB6,"Can't say that I was a big Manilow fan. Bought this DVD because I enjoy all kinds of music, and the other reviews sounded good. The surprise for me, was how many of the songs I knew, but had forgotten. The quality of the DVD, both sound and video is very good, and Barry Manilow does put on a great show! Almost felt like I was at in Vegas. I recommend this one highly. If you're over 50 - you can't go wrong. If you're younger - take a listen, and enjoy someone who really does know how to ""write the songs that make the whole world sing.""",1328054400,,540,4.0092592592592595
