This review is from: Lully: Armide (DVD)
Was there a sale on red shifts for Baroque opera productions? An extended scene has the entire chorus, male and female in bright red shifts, the baritone Hatred -- hirsute head to toe -- as well. There was a use of it in the Salzburg production of Theodora in which the lead countertenor dons one. I purchased this recording based upon the scholarly positive reviews posted here. I doubt that I will watch it often due to certain aspects of its regietheater which I found off-putting. If it is true that Baroque opera especially lends itself to regietheater, I would invite comment as to why. Perhaps modernism with deconstruction must reject the strict moralizing of authority? By contrast, I was enchanted by the traditional Herve Niquet production of Lully's Persee. Acknowledging that I may just be a fuddy-duddy, allow me to explain.
The production begins cleverly with young tourists intruding late into the audience only to form a chorus to be joined by tourists on a dancing tour of Versailles. They are led by two lady museum guides (Armide's associates Glory and Wisdom). One of the tourists, a bemused befuddled tenor reminding me in manner of Pee Wee Herman (sorry), falls asleep in Louis' bed to become, if passive, a modern-dress crusader/hero/enemy of Armide, a cruel self-obsessed heroine (in red shift). In spite of herself she falls in love and by magic turns him into loving her, only to be tormented that he cannot love her otherwise. There is a scene in which all of the chorus, Hatred and her (his?) attendants in the red shifts, forceably, sadistically kiss Armide in parting. She is left stunned. There is a scene in which one of two young fellows, tourists with flashlights looking among the audience for monsters, is bewitched on stage by an admittedly toothsome entirely naked demon-lover female dancer. I rather liked it but found it distracting. (My wife`s eyes widened and eyebrows raised.) After their roll in the hay she disappears as if an illusion. The dancing throughout is modern and athletic: the tourists leaping and pumping arms in Broadway style; the courtiers at times in stiff procession and at times in dervish-like spinning. There is extended modern dance in sweeping Martha Graham moves by all dancers over the sleeping hero -- yes in red shifts. At the end,the hero summons the courage to reject Armide and exits the scene in bright red formal court costume of the same color and fabric of a dress worn earlier by Armide. There are other parallels. Are we to take it he has assumed her power? If so, is it a good thing? Or is it just a fashion device?Armide kills herself (in a red shift). We are returned to present day tourists in Versailles. The tourist/hero is awakened and urgently ushered from the room. One of the museum guides throws his shoes out the window. To add to my caviling, there now appears in Baroque opera productions not only a practice of dressing main male characters in red shifts but a trope of choreographed exaggerated hand movement. It worked for me as dance in the Glyndebourne Guilio Cesare but seems merely robotic here. Those who remember the group Devo will know what I mean. Admittedly, the printed synopsis included shows the original to be so complex as to be difficult indeed to stage traditionally. The music is splendid, the chorus glorious, the soloists excellent. Christie, as to be expected, is properly supportive. I only wish the production were less than what seemed to be a series of novel entr'actes and more a thorough work of art consistent with Lully's noble original. I am given to think that the French aesthetic can be admirable and trivial at the same time.

4465319,5,B004T6ABVE,"I am overwhelmed with enthusiasm for this production! It is sheer delight! I'm always leery of modern productions of the old masters (just look at the messes that have been made of Handel's beautiful operas). In the present case the director Robert Carsen has managed to produce a tasteful, fully artistic production that compliments the musical brilliance of William Christie's superb orchestra. Tasteful is the key; having Armide in brilliant scarlet and the rest of the cast in a silver grey was a stroke of genius. The ballets were fine and fit well with the action. Many of the same people were in the production of Rameau's Les Paladins where the music was superb but the action and dance were like Monty Python on steroids. Here the music was complimented by the actions on stage. The singing of all the many roles was well done. In particular the Armide of Stephanie d'Oustrac was particularly exciting. Her rendering of ""Enfin, il est en ma puissance"" was the high point of the opera; it is one of the most dramatic scenes in all opera. The only quibble I might have is the ending. This is a fantasy opera of magic and spells and such. It should have had a fantasy ending. Other composers have had the spurned Armide fly off on a dragon chariot. And here the librettist Quinault indicates something similar. However the director has Armide kill herself. This is a sudden Wozzeck realism injected into a pleasant fanasy world. Otherwise everything about this production is right on.",1313712000,3,1490,4.801556420233463
4465320,5,B004T6ABVE,"I find that William Christie, with whatever director he is working with, always manages to strike a fine balance between fidelity to the spirit of Baroque opera and making meaningful use of modern theatrical techniques that don't so much revise the work as put it into a context that makes it more accessible to a wider audience.  That's certainly the case when working with the opera director Robert Carsen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Borades/dp/B0001Z65PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Borades</a>), and the narrowing of the gap between the past and the present is taken quite literally in this production of Jean-Baptiste Lully's Armide (1686), the prologue filmed on location at Versailles, with ballet sequences much like the ones traditionally seen in the intervals of the televised New Year's Day Concerts from Vienna.  There on the bed of the King of France amidst the praise given to Louis XIV, Paul Agnew falls asleep and, like in a dream, goes back to a stylised past where the story of Armide unfolds.

Thereafter, there is less cleverness and a mostly straightforward operatic staging, but like Carsen and Christie's work together on Rameau's Les Borades, it's a highly stylised, fictional period setting, with elegant courtly uniformity of design and colour schemes to suggest location and mood.  It's utterly beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, making striking use of light and colour, but working also in coordination with the tone, mood and rhythm of the music score.  Christie, an American, is a recognised national treasure in France for the work he has done breathing life into the dusty, stuffy academicism of old-fashioned French Baroque opera, works his usual wonders here with Lully.  The content of the opera itself - a mythological story of a noble knight who resists the lure of bewitchment from a dangerous siren (Ulysees, Parsifal) - is nothing special and not particularly dramatic, but it's given a remarkably beautiful and sensitive treatment by Lully and librettist Philippe Quinault in their consideration of the characters and the emotional journey they undergo.  Although it follows the usual conventions of the Five-Act Baroque opera form, with recitative, aria and ballet sequences, there's a wonderful flow to the piece, which doesn't have the usual stop/start rhythms, but a musical coherence and gentleness that is closer to Monteverdi than the later heavier dance rhythms of Rameau.

As tastefully and as pitch-perfectly as Carsen, Christie and Les Arts Florissants present the work, in complete accord with each other and within the themes, tone and tenor of the original work, the singing brings out the wonderful, beautiful human touch and emotional heart of Lully's opera work.  Stephanie d'Oustrac takes Armide through a deeply emotional journey that culminates in her famous aria at the end of Act III (""Enfin, il est en ma puissance""), but she also harmonises beautifully with Paul Agnew's wonderful Renaud in their Act V duet (""Armide, vous m'aller quitter"").  Anders J. Dahlin also has the lovely aria of the fortunate lover in Act V, who advises all to take advantage of the fleeting years of youth and happiness before they are gone forever (again reminiscent of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo).  It may seem like little more than a divertissement, glorifying noble sentiments that have the power to enchant (banishing Hatred and inspiring Love), but the proof of these powers is in the enchantment of Lully's music itself.

There are no complaints with the presentation of the opera on Blu-ray.  The image is clear throughout, conveying the stunning colour schemes perfectly, with bold reds standing out against the subdued uniformity of the silver/grey and gold tones.  The soundtrack in the usual PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes gives a wonderful, warm stage to the music and the singing.  There's a fine half-hour extra feature 'Armide at Versailles', which has Christie and Carson talking about their approach to the production, but also has a superbly informative contribution from Benit Dratwicki on the fascinating history of the piece, its relevance to its time and its place in the tradition of the French tragdie-lyrique.",1310688000,10,4238,5.342342342342342
4465321,5,B004T6ABVE,"The first time I viewed this production on European television I was blown away.  I have seen each of William Christie's renditions of Rameau's operas staged (well... on DVD) and each set has been a treasure, not simply for Christie's fresh, suave interpretations of oft-neglected gems of French opera, but for the visual treats the directors and designers provide to the viewer.

There is just something about French baroque opera that benefits from regietheater.  I was eager to see Christie and his artistic team take on an opera from the father of French opera, Jean-Baptiste Lully.  He presents in this DVD set Lully's last complete tragedie-lyrique, Armide.  As an opera, the story of the sorceress Armida and the crusader Rinaldo has been done almost to death.  Composers from Handel (Rinaldo), Salieri (Armida) and Glueck (who used the same libretto as did Lully) set it to music.  To produce such a hackneyed story for modern audiences requires not only a fresh look at the music but also at the staging.

Robert Carsen is just the man for the job.  The staging is modern with strong hints of the French Baroque, inspired by the rooms at Versailles, yet covered in a monochromatic reflecting silver, colored occasionally and elegantly by the stage lighting.  All characters but a few are decked out in the same muted silver, but in petticoats that remind one of the costumes of the Baroque.

Stephanie D'Oustrac is stunning and regal in her red dresses that truly draws the eye amidst the muted surroundings.  Her voice carries a smoky quality that is perfect for the part of a sorceress queen.  Of special mention is the staging of the famous prelude, recitative and aria, ""Enfin, il est en ma puissance.""  Here, simplest is best as Carsen has only Mme D'Oustrac and the unconscious Renaud (played brilliantly by Paul Agnew), on a field of rose petals on a blacked out stage.  In this scene of attempted murder, D'Oustrac owns the stage.  The recit is one of Lully's most theatrical and convincing scenes, often recorded, but D'Oustrac has raised the bar here.  It is a difficult scene where the singer/actress must pull off rage and weakness at once.

The scene of La Haine is likewise one of those brilliant and utterly memorable scenes envisioned by Mr Carsen.  Again, simplest is best, as Laurent Naouri plays the travesti role of La Haine.  She and her followers wear nothing else but the same red nightgown donned by Armide.  Together with the choreography the scene is intense and sinister, proof of a good director - where such things can be pulled off with minimal theatrics.

The choreography is all modern, reminiscent of the dances in Christie's DVD of Rameaus Les Boreades, albeit more subdued.  Somehow, the modernity fits with this centuries old music.  A prime example is the Marche and Rondeau, ""Armide est encore plus aimable... Suivons Armide.""  Note the entry of Armide's minions, whose movements are timed and spaced precisely to fit the music.  The ballet to the famous Passacaille is dreamy and mesmerizing.

As for the music itself, Christie reminds us why Armide is Lully's most enduring work next to the incidental music to Moliere's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.  The tasteful addition of percussion (as was the practice in French Baroque) to Lully's dotted rhythms brings one back to the pomp and circumstance of Louis XIV's court.  You will not find yourself skipping over the recitatives in this production.

One could not hope for a better production of French Baroque opera on DVD.  Christie, Carsen and D'Oustrac especially do Lully's last tragedie-lyrique justice.  It is a lovely, sexy emotional roller coaster that I would highly recommend.",1306195200,49,3682,4.975450081833061
8440521,5,B004T6ABVE,Over the top!!!  This was so well produced that the Blu-ray was stolen.  I plan to replace it via Amazon.,1433376000,,105,4.2
8440522,1,B004T6ABVE,"I was looking forward to enjoying the wonderful music and story of Lully's Armide.  Although the music and singing were terrific the staging and production failed.  To be sure there were some clever modern techniques that were employed and that did add to the story.  I have no objection to an effort to modernize such a piece.  However, there exist in this production serious interpretive and moral failures.

Without getting into undue detail, one driving theme of the story is the choice between love and honor/glory/duty.  This is a classical theme running throughout ancient literature.  The Greeks esteemed honor (), glory () and duty ( ) above all virtues.  Love ( not ) was a competing virtue -- true honorable love.

This production pits not honorable love against glory but lust.  To be sure Armide uses sorcery to fool her enemy into a form of ""love"" that mimics true love but in doing so discovers its emptiness and failure and it becomes her undoing.

That lust is confounded with love is highlighted by the costumes, staging and emphasis on sexually explicit gestures and even full nudity.  The male heroes in this opera were not torn between pure lust and duty but between true love and duty - whether that true love was real or fake.  Lust is not on the radar here.

Thus, by substituting lust for love the producers miss the mark and destroy the entire ethos of the play.  Further, it decries their own moral failure to discriminate between love () and lust ().  And this is a sad commentary of our generation and of Europe.",1422748800,5,1541,4.6940298507462686
8440523,3,B004T6ABVE,"I let myself be convinced by all the positive reviews that this DVD has on Amazon.com, failing (to my regret) to fully appreciate Ben Franklin's negative review of it. The staging is tolerable in Acts I and V, but there are just parts of this production that sour the whole experience. Take, for example, those hairy-chested male demons in women's garb applying red lipstick on in Act III! Or the stark-naked female dancer in Act IV who is only thinly disguised behind some veils! (thankfully, she took good care of shaving her private parts before appearing in this production). Also, Mr. Carsen's decision to dress dancers as if they were tourists in the Prologue is perhaps acceptable, but dressing Ubalde and the Danish Knight in Act IV as such (with backpacks and all) is just too much for me. What a way to murder good taste. Lully must be rolling in his grave.",1335571200,11,867,4.673202614379085
8440524,3,B004T6ABVE,"To put it bluntly, for me, there was very little worth watching here except for the subtitles.  No quarrel with the beautiful music or performance but you can also get that, for less money, on Herreweghe's CD.  In the documentary, Robert Carsen explains that he wanted the production to be based on tourists at Versailles going through Louis XIV's bedroom!  I am not joking.  Now what the heck does that have to do with Armide and Renaud?  Carsen did a much more interesting job in the setting for Rameau's Boreades which while it had updated costumes, enchanted with its depiction of the seasons.  In Armide, two colors, silverish gray and bright red monopolized the visual aspect.  Some of the low points were Paul Agnew in his briefs on a bed singing on his knees and a devil character with a hairy chest in a red dress.  Save your money.",1330214400,8,841,4.597315436241611

The choreography reminded me of Tai-Chi classes except that, in Armide, all participants seemed to be ""under the influence"".  And, as I heard and saw it, their movements did not seem to ""cling"" to the music.  Get Atys if you have not done so already, and see the difference!",1326931200,4,441,4.9324324324324325

8440528,5,B004T6ABVE,"I've been a fan of William Christie and Les Arts for years. That is enough for me to purchase a CD or DVD. The music is glorious. However, stagings vary. A friend saw a production in Paris a few years ago which she described as  ""people leaping about in their underwear"". William Christie has, diplomatically, disagreed with this kind of production. I first read about the Armide in Opera News. More Eurotrash?  Undeterred, I ordered. Although I prefer the elegant (and expensive to mount) 18th Century stagings, the DVD production was a highly successful and enjoyable blend of Old and New. The set is musically and visually wonderful. Highly recommended!",1319155200,2,656,4.954545454545454
8440529,5,B004T6ABVE,"Productions of any opera by Wagner, Puccini, Strauss, even by Alban Berg necessarily take account of a living performance tradition, based on a continuum of interpretations stretching back to the premieres at which the composer himself would have been in attendance. There is no such living tradition pertinent to baroque opera. The thread was cut!  ""Baroque opera"" as we know it is an invention of our own era, and an expression of our own aesthetics. The paradox, however, is that the majority of recent baroque opera stagings have been aesthetically bi-polar; the musicians have consistently and fervently striven for ""historically informed performance practices"", using original instruments and authentic baroque vocal technique. Meanwhile, the stage directors, dance choreographers, costumers and set designers have self-consciously striven to captivate audiences with a diametrically opposite modernism: witty anachronism, surreal stagecraft, jazzy dance, effects borrowed from Cirque du Soleil. Hey, is that reasonable? Does it work for you, or for the box office? Well, sometimes yes and sometimes no ... but what's surprising about that? The same could be said of the stodgiest staging of La Triviata or Madama Clothsmoth; some productions succeed and some don't.

Frankly, this staging of Lully's Armide is not at all extreme, not in comparison to many of the available DVDs of Rameau and Handel operas. There are two components of this opera and thus of this staging. The prologue is an extended bit of sycophancy addressed to King Louis XIV. Lully knew his audience! It consisted of two men, Le Roi et lui meme (the King and himself). Lully's fulsome tribute to his patron, in this production, is wittily reshaped as a modern tour of the Palace of Versailles. The somewhat bumptious tourists reappear briefly later in the opera, singing from the audience, but the tale of the witch Armide and the crusader knight Renaud is not set in modern times at all. Rather, the costumes and stage objects set the story in a timeless semi-antiquity, which very likely would have been the ambience sought by Lully's own contemporaries. One man's opinion here, of course, but frankly I find the staging quite graceful and entertaining. It's the music that matters, anyway, and the music here is as polished  and lovely as music by Lully can ever be. Great singing, great instrumental ensemble, and the greatest conductor of French baroque since Lully smashed his big toe with his baton and died of gangrene.

Some viewers of this DVD have fretted over the scene on the second disk, in which those gorpless tourists reappear and encounter a 'spirit' from Armide's court, a bare naked dancer who pops up from the royal bed that dominates the sets of many scenes. Yes, as far as I could tell on the HD plasma screen of my TV, that dancer is as naked as a snake. However, she's veiled by a semi-transparent scrim of cloth. Do I need to remind you that everyone is naked under more or fewer layers of cloth? Or that the walls of Versailles, let alone of the Vatican, are lined with quite realistic pictures of naked women and men? Do we really need to react pruriently to a naked spirit veiled in gauze on a TV screen? Besides, there IS a tradition of nudity on the opera stage that stretches far back beyond so-called 'regietheater'. How about the Dance of the Veils in Richard Strauss's Salome? Quite a few divas - Maria Ewing for one - have gotten bare on stage in that role, all for art. And how about Prokofiev's Fiery Angel, in which dozens of male and female demons writhe on stage wearing nothing but body paint? Not to mention the nudity of modern dance companies like Pilobolus! There are credible memoirs of seeing naked dancers on stage in 17th C France, Lully's own era, in the operas of Francesco Cavalli. To be blunt, I'm sick and tired of American yelping about 'regietheater' and 'Euro-trash"". Whether it's chauvinism or fuddy-duddyism, it's misapplied. When America supports as many opera theaters, with as high standards of musicianship and creativity, as Europe -- Germany, Austria, France, Netherlands, Italy -- then Americans might have the right to sniff and snarl at ""Euro-trash"". Until then, ""Enough already!""

DVD opera fans, when Thanksgiving rolls around this year, remember to be grateful! This is a glorious era of musicianship, The virtuosity of singers and instrumentalists right now exceeds that of a few decades ago by orders of magnitude, and we have the sublime privilege of appreciating it in our own homes.",1316217600,11,4537,4.996031746031746
