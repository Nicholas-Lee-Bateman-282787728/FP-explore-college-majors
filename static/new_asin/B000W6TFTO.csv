8221363,5,B000W6TFTO,Love this video content and I buy it for my son's collection who enjoy the BabyFirst TV channel. I can have complete control to let him watch this to soothe him to sleep.,1421107200,,170,4.181818181818182
8221364,5,B000W6TFTO,"Very good for calming children, especially before bedtime.  I like that it's kind of relaxing and entertaining for adults too.  Doesn't drive you crazy like a lot of the children's shows.",1401235200,,187,5.0
8221365,5,B000W6TFTO,"Every time my 13 mth old is fussy, or being difficult, I put this in & put on the 'Sandman' or 'Mobiles' & she'll stop & watch it!  She even laughs, claps & stands directly in front of the tv, to get a better look!  The accompanying lullabies & classical music in the background, combined with the bold colors & different shapes of the mobile, captures her attention every time!  It's the same with Sandman, which is a lighted table, with a little bit of sand on top.  The person draws fun pictures & my baby's completely captivated, watching the pictures take form.  And she enjoys the music in the background too :)",1363737600,,617,4.424778761061947
