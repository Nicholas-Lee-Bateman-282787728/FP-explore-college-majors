8194047,4,B000Q20C4G,"I have owned this workout for a while and hadn't done it in a long time (I have over 30 workout tapes/DVDs). I did it this morning and man oh man, what a workout. I did make alterations such as one legged jumping jacks versus full high impact jacks and some of the moves I did NOT do on the step but did it on the floor. Regardless, I got a tremendous workout. Two sets of weights are used: light weight 3-5 lbs and heavier weights 8-10 lbs. Unless you are really toned and in shape with working out with weights I would recommend using 8 lbs max with this workout. Most of the reps are done quickly and 8 lbs is easier to handle when doing the upper body.",1217548800,,656,4.053846153846154
