8531324,5,B008W7JC0M,Interesting diversity of exercises--and Tracie does an excellent job of cueing.  I actually found this DVD much easier to do than Susan Harris's Sculpting Basics.  Although I love doing Susan's workout on the days I want to be challenged a little more. Great combo from The Firm!!,1519776000,,280,4.9361702127659575
8531325,5,B008W7JC0M,"I stumbled on this as a VHS tape back in 1997, when I was my late 40's. I added Firm Basics Abs, Buns & Thighs, and between them regained my  pre-baby, very in-shape body. Last time I looked, these weren't available in DVD. 68 now, and I know these well enough to modify as needed until I get back up to speed. I'm delighted by the re-release.",1494288000,3,343,4.119402985074627
8531326,5,B008W7JC0M,"This video changed my life. As a couch potato, I struggled to complete it the first two weeks. I was so out of shape! This is a beginners workout but is not easy.  I did noticed significant changes in my body to continue using it after the first two weeks. By the end of the month, I lost 10 lbs and looked slim. Then I decided to buy other "" old school "" Firm videos ( the classic, vol. 1-6). The later are for moderate exercisers. With these videos, I've lost 50 lbs!!!! I've been doing them since 5 yrs ago and been able to maintain my weight. Thanks To Ana Benson for designing such impressive workouts. Also, Tracie Long is a great instructor. She will guide you in order to maintain proper form during this video. You need a chair for this video as well as weights, and a broomstick for balance.",1480896000,2,801,4.235294117647059
8531327,5,B008W7JC0M,"Excellent work out.  Simple, tough, and effective.  Less than 45 minutes and every second is used wisely. Great instructor.",1448150400,3,123,5.421052631578948
8531328,5,B008W7JC0M,"A great workout and the trainer is very good at prompting you in advance of upcoming moves which are simple but effective.  I also have ""Tough Tape"" by the same trainer and I alternate them.",1446768000,2,190,4.428571428571429
8531329,5,B008W7JC0M,This is a great workout dvd. It tones all the muscles of your body using low impact moves. Tracie Long gives great instructions which are very helpful for the beginner. The moves and weights in this video can be modified to suit everyone's needs. I would highly recommend this workout tape.,1446336000,3,290,4.705882352941177
8531330,5,B008W7JC0M,Great workout. The Firm Workouts I used to do. Good for someone with joint problems.,1414627200,7,84,4.666666666666667
8531331,5,B008W7JC0M,"This is part of the Firm Basics tritrainer and it's been around for 16 yrs. The emphasis is in body sculpting with basic cardio moves in between without a wasted second of this 45 minute routine.
I've been doing this workout on and off for about 10 yrs because is perfect in every way specially when I feel I'm out of shape. After doing this 3 times per week alternating with various cardio routines every other day I get incredible results , I lose weight and fat and my body looks toned and fabulous.  Tracy Long will get you doing all the required repetitions of the exercises and you will hardly notice since it is perfectly coreographed with the music ( typical of older Firm tapes) . You will start with a 7 min warm-up and stretch ,27 min of standing weights and cardio and some seated routines followed by 9 mins of pecs,abs ,inner thighs and briidge moves. You'll also get pelvic floor exercises during the workout. A short stretch finishes all. I highly recommend this DVD .",1400630400,9,984,4.4972067039106145
