There was nothing in this video that had any connection to the mastiff. Showed other breeds and one mastiff running around which was moderately entertaining for my dog. No training information that was at all helpful.",1237161600,2,428,7.916666666666667
8184836,1,B000OFORN2,An utter waste.  19 minutes or bad background music while some monotone guy pats his puppy and states the obvious.,1233100800,,114,4.7
8184837,1,B000OFORN2,"I threw this DVD away after watching it last night. Only 19 minutes address the Mastiff, and what little information is offered is a highly abbreviated version of what can be found in any book on the breed. Worse, only two Mastiffs are shown: a brindle puppy and a fawn puppy. The brindle sits on a table while the amateurish narrator talks about the breed and pets the puppy, and the fawn is shown padding around in a park (and taking a bath). The background music made me want to pull my hair out. If I could give this video zero stars, I would. This is the worst video rip-off I've ever encountered. Don't waste your money.",1228176000,3,626,4.358974358974359
8184838,2,B000OFORN2,"I had a Mastiff some years ago and thought I would see if there was something new to learn since I just got a puppy. I found the DVD to be disinteresting and it seemed to be made by someone with a home editing program, instead of a professionally made flick. It may be useful for someone who has never had a large dog, but don't get it looking for anything unique. I thought the host was borish and the presentation was poor.",1191974400,6,425,4.132530120481928
8184839,1,B000OFORN2,"Well if you like your DVD to be real cheesy then this would be the one. There isn't much information about the breed on the DVD let alone they talk about the size the breed can get to but never show a full grown animal to compair. Was very disappointed in the DVD. I could have found more info on the breed by watching Turner and Hooch then the DVD.
 I would highly NOT recommend this to anyone.",1191715200,4,395,4.064102564102564
