My husband and I know the Cha Cha but there were some very good moves in this DVD that we could use in our dancing, if not the whole move, some of the steps can be combined with what we already know.  SalsaCrazy did it again, WONDERFUL",1325376000,2,302,4.101694915254237
8224723,1,B000WOYSDO,"If you have never danced in your life this is the video for you.  Asking for a refund, not much to this DVD than about a few moves.

If you saw the Salsa Crazy series, Bachata or Merengue they were good.  I wish to return the Cha Cha for refund or exchange.",1205625600,6,257,3.9038461538461537
