I love BEAN! FDTV is some funny stuff. FD did something different and people who don't understand uniqueness often don't understand art such as this. FDTV is creative and funny at the same time. If you are tired of the norm and ready to look outside the box and get a few laughs in at the same time, this DVD is for you! We'll be looking out for the next one!",1118275200,,525,4.106796116504855
2553369,5,B0009IRKDI,"i understand that with everything new, different and especially unique there will always be those out there who will not understand. I am so greatful for people like Galileo, Copernicus and FD. For a long time people thought the world was flat. Or the universe revolved around the earth. When Mozart wrote his first symphonies they were labeled trash. Look  me personally I'm not a hater. I'm an open minded individual who understands that to set an impression on the world YOU GOTTA BE DIFFERENT. I read a review on FDTV VOL 1 and was saddened to see a critic stuck on their normality of viewing DVD's. FD made this DVD from scratch. I personally am aware of the movie industry and marketing. FD started at 16 and made over 50 movies. This kid is a GENIUS. Do you know how difficult it is to make credits go down at the end of a movie. I'm in the industry so i know. Someone of technical skill must be able to do this. From reading his website I found out it was him who even made the menu selection screen on the DVD. I mean lets give this kid and his work credit. He's making a living like we all are. With no BUDGET! I mean like WARNERS BROS. or DREAMWORKdidn't pay this kid any money. This wasn't made on no multi-million dollar budget. I am amazed at how much fun i had watching FDTV and knowing there was no big budget. To me this helped in its uniqueness and its laughs. So as it was with Galileo and the rest of them some people will only appreciate FDTV VOL 1after Warner Bros, or Viacom (MTV) buys him or his work and volumes 2 and 3 come out on that bigger budget  some are so trained to identify with.",1118016000,,1614,4.237012987012987

2553371,5,B0009IRKDI,"Definitely the WORST DVD I purchased this year!!! -- or any year! Not one bit funny -- terrible production value. You will be BORED out of your mind! Amazed at how stupid it is and how you badly you were ripped off. It's like some high school kid made it. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!

You'll be SORRY if you waste money on this garbage!!!!!!!!!!!",1117929600,3,342,4.2615384615384615
2553372,4,B0009IRKDI,"I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE BUT I ENJOYED THIS VERY MUCH. AND FOR ALL THOSE OUT THERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION VALUE, DO U READ DESCRIPTIONS? IT CLEARLY STATES THAT IT IS AND UNDERGROUND JOINT. IF YOU WANT HOLLYWOOD GLITS AND GLAMOUR OVER SUBSTANCE GO HIT UP WARNER BROTHERS, I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT TO LAUGH, HALF WAY THROUGH I REALIZED THAT I WAS APART OF SOMETHING. WHEN THESE DUDES ARE ALL OVER HOLLYWOOD I CAN SAY I WAS ONE OF THEIR FIRST REAL FANS!",1117929600,,458,4.464285714285714
2553373,4,B0009IRKDI,"very funny, i understand that some people might not want to risk and purchase something that they haven't heard of but it is well worth. This thing is really good and buying it with the chappelles show season 2 will really save you some cash. and besides would it be next to chappelle season 2 if it wasn't good? c'mon now",1117843200,,322,4.295081967213115

I try to pride myself on being a fan of comedy but now i realize that there are gems out there that no one has discovered yet. Whoever gives this guy fd his big break won't be sorry. This is some of the most original and clever stuff i've seen in a long time.

2553377,4,B0009IRKDI,i liked this dvd. it was like watching mr bean in the hood. the only thing i didn't like about this dvd was that i thought the movies should be longer. they went by too quick. i liked most of the movies on here though. i want to see more of the fast motion skits too. that would have been better also. im gonna bring this to work and see what my buddy thinks of it.,1119312000,2,365,3.8157894736842106

FDTV was my first purchase on Amazon. I would have never bought this DVD if I hadn't met FD on the streets of NYC. He is passing out promotional DVDs with the Amazon.com logo on the back of the DVD. The promo was funny so I decided to buy it from Amazon. I am now a Amazon customer thanks to FD. This is my first review and I plan on writing more in the future.

The DVD was funny. I am looking at Thomas Bumbera's other reviews and he has never even bought anything with a black man's face on it.

Know what is going on before you bad mouth something. That kid FD is on the streets everyday trying to promote his product and bring new people to Amazon and people like Thomas Bumbera bad mouth and say it is all some scam. It is called hard work and promotion my friend. Good luck FD.",1119312000,2,791,4.025477707006369
2553379,5,B0009IRKDI,"is the same guy who is saying that this DVD isn't funny.

NOTE: THIS DVD HAD ME CRYING FROM LAUGHTER

I liked the FDTV DVD. I think that this sort of comedy is right on time. It is abstract yet simplistic. The simplicity generated a lot of laughs over at my house. I was expecting a Chappelle's Show 'knock-off' but it was totally opposite in a good way.

I was sad when I read a bad review just like I was sad when they cancelled ""Family Guy"" from FOX in 2002. Who was the guy that said, ""...this show is trash, CANCEL IT."" ? Obviously someone who didn't know the meaning of comedy.

It took the ""Adult Swin"" (Cartoon Network's latenight comedy block) crowd to let an idiot exec over at Fox know that Family Guy was a hit and it was here to stay.

I feel the same way about this DVD. I read a few negative reviews but then I think about that exec over at Fox and I figure some people just don't know a hit when they see it.

Now they wanna bring Family Guy back to FOX after 3 years of seeing that the show was a hit and that the following was incredible. I see the same thing happening with this FDTV. Maybe it will take 3 years for others to catch on. Who knows?

I know I love it and I will continue to support. Good luck guys. Keep up the good work. When will Vol. Two be on pre-order?",1119225600,,1290,3.9961089494163424
2553380,4,B0009IRKDI,"i liked this, i'm a film student at nyu and i really appreciated the style of this film, i showed it to my profesor and he was also impressed. now to get away from the analytical, i thought this was funny and creative. if u want something that is totally different from whats currently on tv then this is the buy for u.",1119139200,2,319,4.079365079365079
2553381,5,B0009IRKDI,this guy fd and man are wild. i never seen a dvd like this before. i watched this movie three times so far. im gonna get one more and pass it around the dorms at my college. people always steal my good dvds. this show rocks! if you ever need a cool white guy to act in the movies send me a email guys ahaha! *****,1119139200,2,313,3.757575757575758
2553382,5,B0009IRKDI,"I went to Borough of Manhattan Community College with FD and the little time I spent in class with him, I have nothing but good to say about that guy. When he walked into class, he had a star-like quality that I can't explain. Very humble, excitied and enthusiastic.

I supported what he was trying to do, so I bought his movie off of Amazon. It is sad to see how people are trying to ruin this guy that is trying to do something positive and shed some light on others. This guy really isn't rich. He is a struggling college student from the worst neighborhood in Brooklyn just like me.

Please stop the hate. Most of you people hating are probably doing much better than he is doing. Please don't insult other FDTV fans either. This comedy may not be for you.

We are in an age where someone with creativity can CREATE. If you splatter some paint on a canvas, people won't consider it art unless its in a art gallery. Isn't that backward?

To the guy who keeps writing bad reviews (I know you are the same person): Don't insult other people with a better sence of humor than you. I looked at your other reviews and I'm sad to say that I DON'T like the stuff you gave 5 STARS. Everything isn't made to please YOU.

This movie is for people with open minds and not people who just follow the norm and buy into what they see on t.v. like this guy J. White. This stuff is comical. It is urban comedy, very underground. Some of it is slapstick, some are just stories I can relate to growing up.

Had I grown up in Cincinnati, OH where the corn fields are, I may not be able to relate with this as well as someone from New York. But does that mean this DVD isn't a classic because I can't relate? Good luck FD... I thought they wait til you get famous to try and ruin you but I guess some people just have it so bad they just want to make it bad for everyone else.

Keep up the good work guys. Will be looking for Volume 2.",1119139200,3,1918,4.126005361930295
2553383,5,B0009IRKDI,"This is an independent movie. People who have bought this movie should recommend this movie with other DVDs. I recommended this movie with about 20 other comedy movies that I liked and own.

Why get mad everytime you turn on the t.v. and see a McDonalds ad?

Products need visibility.

Isn't that what we are suppose to do as customers at Amazon? Support the independents. Recommend this DVD with other funny stuff.

MY FAVORITE CHAPTERS ON FDTV: I thought the Do's & Don'ts, Wanted, Bike, The Chase, Infiltrate & Cwakhed the best out of the 29 movies. The behind the scenes footage was also funny. I liked when the homeless man got in front of the camera and said ""...what you guys doing?"". Funny stuff, rewinded it like 30Xs. Funny DVD, could turn out to be classic. This DVD should be getting more exposure but I know how pricely ads can be on an independent budget. Good work guys at FDTV.",1119139200,2,893,4.527950310559007
2553384,5,B0009IRKDI,I had a few friends over the other night for my birthday party. I popped the FDTV in and let the DVD play over and over. Everyone kept asking me what it was. All my friends want a copy now. This is some good stuff to watch with friends when you are hanging out. Funny stuff. When is Vol. 2 gonna be out?,1118448000,2,303,3.8253968253968256
2553385,5,B0009IRKDI,"Why do people hate FD? He's just a young guy trying to follow his dreams of being a director and actor. Everyone wants to be on television but we all know how many actors are lined up outside the Hollywood casting offices. Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. Stop comparing this to Stephen Spielberg and open up your mind. This was done by a lone young man with a dream. Look outside of the box. Don't be mad at someone else for chasing their dreams. FDTV reminds me of shows that started out with humble beginnings such as South Park. South Park started out as cheezy construction paper cut-outs. Most of you people can't see a diamond in the rough. You just want to jump on the stones that are on display in the diamond district instead of helping to encourage a new jewel to shine. I know these FDTV DVDs will keep getting better and better. If you watch the first movie, then the last movie on the DVD, you will see the growth in the works. Stop being so closed minded. We need something new on the scene. Don' t ruin something good for other people. There are a lot of people out there like me who enjoy this type of comedy. Keep up the good work FD. On the road to success there will be people trying to knock you down, but don't let that stop you FD.",1118361600,2,1277,4.216326530612245

I showed this DVD to my mom and she didn't reallu understand what was going on, but this isn't for moms anyway. hahahaha.... keep up the good work FD and Man. 5 stars.",1118361600,2,395,4.142857142857143

Good stuff fellas!! Keep it up!",1120867200,4,364,4.0
8118021,4,B0009IRKDI,I checked this out last night. It was pretty cool but it needed to be longer. The stuff was funny but some of the endings came too quick. I liked maybe 17 out of the 28 chapters. There should be an extended edition because I see that this is the limited edition. Should explain more about what was happening in some of the movies. Some people won't understand. Like a commentary track would be cool also. I wanted to see more movies like the last one on there. That would've been cool also. I like the on duty footage the most. Wheres my doughnuts?,1120262400,7,548,4.278846153846154
8118022,4,B0009IRKDI,"Maybe you got the wrong DVD my friend Don. My DVD was in full color. Or maybe it was that old Zenith television that you have. I liked this movie, but I don't see this as comedy. There are funny moments, but most of it seems like over dramatized urban life. Its funny because the way that it is displayed is so cheezy, you gotta crack a smile. Stop looking at this so technically. If this DVD was a Hollywood/ Warner Brothers production, I'd be upset as well Don. You expect so much out of these big time film production companies, we often get independent productions confused with these. I could tell if these guys had some real money to work with, it could be magic. There was a lot of stuff on this DVD. I like how so many scenerios were created with limited cast, locations and funds. These guys are entertaining. You really can't compare this with anything else because there isn't many DVDs like this in this genre. This is creativity at its best. I understand that its hard to write, direct, market, distribute, design, edit the footage, then come out of your pocket for DVD manufacturing... oh yea, then you gotta make people laugh too. A lot of hard work. Keep it up, your hard work isn't going unnoticed.",1120089600,7,1215,4.452914798206278
