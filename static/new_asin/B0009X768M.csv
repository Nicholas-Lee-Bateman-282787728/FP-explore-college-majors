2332243,4,B0009X768M,Have been looking for this movie for years!!! It was still as funny and enjoyable as when I watched it years ago. Glad I now have it in my library.,1155772800,,147,3.933333333333333
2332244,2,B0009X768M,"My family got cable tv in the early 80's, and I remember, as a kid, watching Dr. Detroit several times and liking it a lot.  I even taped it so that I could watch it when cable stopped showing it as much.  Well, flash forward over twenty years later and I just watched it again and, for whatever reason, the movie just didn't do it for me.  I chuckled a few times at some of the situations, but no out loud laughs.  The ""Dr. Detroit"" persona seemed more stupid than funny.  The ""Mom"" character that I remembered as so funny...wasn't.  Obviously, this movie is just not as good as I remembered.  The only memory of the film that I had that DOES still hold up is Donna Dixon:  she IS as unbelievably gorgeous as I thought.  But since there's no Donna Dixon nudity here, I can't find any reason to recommend it.",1151625600,2,808,4.2631578947368425
2332245,4,B0009X768M,"There's few things worse, cinematically speaking, than an unfunny comedy, and Dan Aykroyd has had his share of them...Caddyshack II (1988), Nothing But Trouble (1991), Canadian Bacon (1995), Sgt. Bilko (1996), Celtic Pride (1996), Blues Brothers 2000 (1998), the list seems endless...but know this, at some point in the past, he did appear in some classic comedies like The Blues Brothers (1980), Neighbors (1981), which I wish would see a DVD release, Trading Places (1983), and this film titled Doctor Detroit (1983).  Co-written by Bruce Jay Friedman (Stir Crazy, Splash), Carl Gottlieb (The Jerk, Caveman), and Robert Boris (Some Kind of Hero), and directed by Michael Pressman (The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training, Some Kind of Hero), the film features, as I mentioned, Dan Aykroyd, along with Howard Hesseman (""WKRP in Cincinnati"", This Is Spinal Tap, Rubin and Ed), Donna Dixon (Spies Like Us), Lydia Lei (Vice Squad), T.K. Carter (Seems Like Old Times, The Thing), Lynn Whitfield (Silverado, The Josephine Baker Story), Fran Drescher (The Hollywood Knights, This Is Spinal Tap), George Furth (Blazing Saddles), Nan Martin (Toys in the Attic), and Kate Murtagh (Waxwork II: Lost in Time), who can also be seen on the cover of Supertramps' biggest selling album ""Breakfast in America"", posing as the diner waitress holding aloft a glass of orange juice.

Aykroyd plays Clifford Skridlow, a professor of comparative literature (primarily focusing on such antiquated notions as chivalry and honor) who fancies speed walking, Indian food, foreign cinema, and lives with his parents (Cliff's father, played by Furth, is chancellor of the university)...basically the antithesis of cool...on the flipside we see Smooth Walker (Hesseman), man about town, making his living peddling the wares of his rather fine stable of ladies, who are coveted by Mom (Murtagh), the big cheese in town, and to whom Smooth is in debt up to his eyeballs.  Mom's willing to settle up (everything Smooth owes, including his ladies, in exchange for his life), but the quick thinking Smooth creates a fictional character called Doctor Detroit, claiming he's in charge of show, and is also trying to muscle in on Mom's territory.  After a couple of coincidental meetings, Smooth sets the nave Cliff up as the patsy, and splits town.  With the help of the girls and Smooth's driver Diavolo (Carter), Cliff dons the role as ""the bad man from Michigan"" out of a sense of honor and duty towards the ladies, assuming the role of their protector.  The situation quickly spirals out of control as the strain of leading a double life wears on Cliff, culminating in his worlds colliding when an alumni dinner and the player's ball are scheduled for the same night, at the same hotel, both of which he's supposed to be in attendance, in one persona or another...not only that, but Mom, along with her goons, decide to crash the party and settle the good doctor's hash once and for all.

This was a pretty ridiculous movie, but I enjoyed it, and thought it was pretty funny.  Aykroyd does a great job in his dual role, but is helped considerably by the supporting cast, especially the women, who are often dressed provocatively and hard not to notice (oh momma), including Ms. Dixon, who met and married Aykroyd during shooting of this film.  Also doing a great job is T.K. Carter, as Smooth's driver, and Kate Murtagh as `Mom', the film's heavy (both figuratively and literally).  Did anyone else notice Mom's baldheaded henchmen were named Johnny and Carson?  Get it?  Johnny Carson?  And if the one playing Johnny (Hank Salas) looks familiar, it's probably because he also played Mike, the thug Matt Dillon's character Melvin Moody hired to protect his interests in the 1980 film My Bodyguard.  The comedy doesn't flow as smoothly throughout here as in some of Aykroyd's other films of the time, but it is present, and in healthy doses.  A few of my favorite scenes include the one where Aykroyd dresses up as a southern gentleman lawyer to get one of the girls out of trouble (the courtroom judge was a real cracker), the scene where we first see Aykroyd as Doctor Detroit, dressed in a scruffy Kato Kaelin wig, yellow sports jacket, green polyester slacks, white platform boots, and a metal gauntlet on his hand, and then near the end, during the finale, when Doctor Detroit does battle with Mom at the hotel.  Another scene I really liked was during the Player's Ball, when James Brown was performing.  I've never seen a 50-year-old man do the splits like Brown did here, sliding back up as smooth as you please.  While I'm going that way I wanted to mention the music, which helped the film a lot.  There were some excellent songs spread throughout by such artists as Pattie Brooks, Devo, Rick James, Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, and The Godfather of Soul, The Hardest Working Man in Show Business, Soul Brother Number One, Mr. James Brown.  The film is rated R, but only because of profanity...alas, there is no real skin to be had here, which was kind of a disappointment given the attractive supporting female cast.

The widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic picture on this Universal Studios DVD release looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through very clear.  Surprisingly there are no special features, not even an original trailer, to be had, but I know the film didn't do very well at the time of its theatrical release, gaining more of a following, I think, from cable viewers (this was how I originally saw the film, since I wasn't old enough to see it in the theaters).  One thing I noticed was a couple of errors in the subtitles.  The one that stuck out was near the beginning, when T.K. Carter's character calls out to Skridlow (whose speed walking) from his car, ""Hey man, nice legs.""  In the movie, Skridlow replies ""Thank you"", but in the subtitles he says something very different...watch with English subtitles activated to see what I mean.

By the way, while the film does feature Detroit in the title, much of it was shot in Chicago, the exteriors at least, a favored location of Aykroyd.",1128988800,14,6134,4.884393063583815
2332246,5,B0009X768M,"All right, so it's not Shakespeare but it is almost as original. One of my personal favorites. Dan Aykroyd chews up the scenery as an appointed ""hero."" Some fine cast members like Fran Drescher, Howard Hesseman and the groovy T.K. Carter make this one a guilty pleasure. This finally made it to DVD but sadly, no trailer. Make an appointment.",1127347200,9,342,4.716666666666667
2332247,5,B0009X768M,"A relatively obscure cult classic, the movie is worth it just to see Aykroyd as Dr. Detroit doing battle with Kate Murtagh as Mom.  Don't expect a great plot since the storyline exists only to connect a series of otherwise disjointed scenes, but there are parts that still make me laugh out loud.  Fran Drescher does a great job as one of the hookers, and George Furth and Nan Martin as Aykroyd's parents are hilarious.",1127088000,4,419,4.573333333333333

2332264,3,B0009X768M,This is a pretty good movie.  One of Dan Aykroyd's better movies.  Usually his movie's have someone else in them like Eddie Murphy or John Belushi.  But this is his moviie. He plays a nerdy college professor who get's recruited to be a pimp.  His initial thought is to say no.  But when the girls come at him out of hot tub.  In something that looks like Bedazzled.  How can you turn that down.  So he becomes Dr. Detroit and takes on Chicago.  It co-stars Donna Dixon who I think he married.  Fran Drescher and Lynn Whitfield who I don't think were well known at the time.  The movie was set up for a sequel but bombed at the box office.  You never know what the public is going to like.,1487894400,,688,4.1679389312977095

2332481,2,B0009X768M,"Hey, it's Dan Aykroyd! How can this movie be a miss then? Well, here's how.

Although this is not a horrible movie, as I did manage to watch it from start to finish, so it's not boring or tedious to watch, it's just one of those old movies that could have been better than what it is. All you have do is check out the cover of the film and take note that it contains the movie, and no extra features to get the idea of how well this movie did and holds up today.

Dan plays Clifford Skridlow, a geek of a university teacher whom is also the son of the college he teaches at. The college is in a bit of financial trouble and are hoping a millionaire will fund the school or it will foreclose. Clifford finds himself mixed up with a pimp named Smooth Walker played by Howard Hessman (Police Academy 2/Head of the Class) whom wants Clifford to take on the persona of a fictional pimp he has made up to get out of paying a woman named Mom who runs the town. Doctor Detroit is born and takes over the town as the #1 and baddest pimp around. However Mom doesn't like competition and so Doctor Detroit finds himself the target of Mom who wants to take him out. Most of the other main characters in the film are the prostitutes of Smooth and the Doctor. One played by Fran Drescher well before her fame as The Nanny, and another by Donna Dixon who, well, if you don't know her name, you probably have only noticed her in the small parts she plays in various comedies over the years. The rest of the cast are mostly mildly recognizable actors you may have seen before.... oh, and James Brown makes an appearance too!

The movie tries to deliver laughs with sex, drugs and a bit of rock n roll pimpin' with some lite slap stick comedy thrown in the mix. But the entire overall formula of the movie leaves you wondering if Dan Aykroyd may have been trying to bite off more than he could chew as the main star of this geek to fake pimp lord role. The premise for a food comedy is there, but the character of Doctor Detroit himself is pretty lame, to me anyway. The weird voice, ugly wig and metallic hand made me wonder if Aykroyd really loved Doctor No and Bond films so much that he couldn't wait to portray a comedic parody of it as Doctor Detroit, or if it's just a case of you should test a character out on SNL or something to see if the thing works or not?

Watching this film you can really see the fact that Aykrod works better with a co-cast of stars, and not so much a solo performance. What was really missing the most from this film was someone else big enough to carry the comedy... someone like, Bill Murray, John Candy, John Belushi or Eddie Murphy. Some kind of involvement from a name like that would have helped this movies potential out alot.

As I said, it's not a terrible movie, it just could have been so much better. Maybe if he had have become the Doctor to save the college perhaps? I can however definitely see this movie being remade someday. It has the formula to be something great, it just needs a much better delivery.

I give it 2 stars.",1388102400,,3059,4.220512820512821

2332538,4,B0009X768M,"Funny, funny movie, and very, very absurd.  Clifford Skridlow (Aykroyd) is a history professor, taken in by ""Smooth"" Walker (Howard Hesseman) as a high-end manager of equally high-end call girls.  Walker has been scamming his boss, Mom, and is looking for a way out, so sets up Skridlow as his patsy.  What he doesn't count on is that Skridlow, who specializes in the culture of the Middle Ages, takes up defense of the four call girls as a knight errant of sorts, Doctor Detroit.

A little bit of the humor is dated, and the hair is *very* eighties, but the story is well done.  A sequel is clearly set up in the closing moments of the film, but the poor box office of what was expected to be a major hit prevented that from ever coming to be.  Still, Clifford's antics while he tries to balance his job, the call girls, and a major fundraiser for his university, and trying to catch a little sleep in between, are very entertaining.

One kvetch I have is the cover.  It's a small thing, but in the original poster and prior releases on VHS, Dan Aykroyd has a sword in his right hand, skewering a roast chicken, as he swings on a steel chain, clearly showing a swashbuckling theme.  On this version, his hand is empty.  No idea why the new release does this, except political correctness.  I mean, hell, doesn't every boy want to swing on a chain, brandishing a sword, with four call girls in the background?  (Joking....)

Seriously, though, this movie is not, *not*, NOT for children.  There are numerous sexual references (though oddly no nudity except on a TV set in the background), and the language is appropriately adult.  Trust me, you *don't* want to have to explain the mention of battery operated devices, underwater....

Why four stars?  Well, this is an older movie that misses at some points, but it is what it is, a comic romp, fairly absurd at times, very absurd at others, but just put the critical part of your brain on hold, and hit ""Play"".  Fran Drescher, as unbelievable as this may sound, is one of the call girls; never been a big fan of hers, but she doesn't hurt the film.  Look for a ""special appearance"" by James Brown near the finale.

All in all, an enjoyable and undeservedly forgotten movie from Aykroyd's early career.",1366502400,8,2251,4.552238805970149

2332566,2,B0009X768M,"I wonder if there is even one film actress who has not been offered the role of a prostitute.  Critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel once mused the reason so many movies include call girl characters is that is the only kind of woman the men who run Hollywood know.

Of course, in movies prostitution almost always seems to be a transaction between consenting adults.  As with the smash PRETTY WOMAN, the Dan Aykroyd farce DOCTOR DETROIT makes being a call girl appear as likely a career choice as accounting or teaching.  I don't hear any female high school graduates saying, ""I'm gonna be a hooker - I really wanted to be a tax accountant but that requires college and I want to start earning now!""

A 1983 comedy, DOCTOR DETROIT presents an innocuous college professor who gets mixed up in an organized crime power struggle involving prostitution and other illegal activity.  Thanks to a capable cast including Aykroyd, Fran Drescher,  T.K. Carter, Howard Hesseman, Andrew Duggan, and George Furth, the action is once in a while humorous, with uninteresting parts that at least never go on to the point where you give up on the film.

Some of DOCTOR DETROIT's best moments belong to Lydia Lei, who, according to the INTERNATIONAL MOVIES DATABASE web site, was about halfway through a decade-long movie & television acting career when she made this title.  Lei's an energetic presence in her portrayal of Jasmine, one of the call girls who helps Aykroyd get in and out of his fine mess.  It is unfortunate her talents may not have been used this well elsewhere.  (I saw Lydia Lei in one other movie, the bomb thriller VICE SQUAD, where she again plays a girl for hire.)

What DOCTOR DETROIT needs most is a more engaging villain.  Actress Kate Murtagh does her best as mob boss Mom but except for menacing people and having her goons chase around Aykroyd every so often, she does not get to do enough to make you root against her.

The plot is corny but its the perfect framework to hang a collection of verbal and visual puns, anecdotes and poking fun at stereotypes.

In this way it is very much the same formula used in the BB movie

The scene where Akroyd impersonates a southern lawyer, complete with a colonel sanders looking outfit he just bought from an attorney in the same courthouse is for me a laugh riot.

The movie was filmed in Chicago and as a native that appealed to me.  Lots of visual and dialogue references to the locale.

I can't imagine I'm alone in appreciating this movie...... it's been recently reissued after being unavailable for a number of years........",1155859200,6,1039,4.5978260869565215
