2244465,5,B0007UPHRO,"One of the first ""novelty films"" every made, The President's Mysterty stands the test of time even without the publicity it recieved when it first came out. This is like the Survivor of its time. The name comes from the fact that FDR spectulated about the plot points  and then a magazine editor got someone to make the mystery move that the president had suggested. The plot is simple - a guy wants to disappear but also take his money with him. How he does it and how he gets caught is the basic plot.",1148256000,2,503,4.294736842105263

2244468,3,B0007UPHRO,"Wall Street & big business evil.  Poor working people & farmers good. One bad rich man sees the light & uses his money (which he made in big business & Wall St.) to save town, workers, farmers & by extension, maybe the country.  Using his evil money in this way he also wins the girl.  All (apparently including President FDR) live happily ever after.  Except evil, rich, Wall St., big businessman & hired thugs who go to jail.  If you really believe this fairy tale, please read a little Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek & even former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel who confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption & modern day robber barons as well as communism.  There are places in a free economy for cooperatives, unions, big business, small business, investment, workers -  in short, for all of us.  I believe that this Amazon Prime transfer is shorter than the original movie. This may explain why it is short on mystery & long on fairy tale.",1422230400,,982,4.735294117647059

2244474,5,B0007UPHRO,"The Presidents Mystery, 1936 film

How can a man disappear with $5 million and not be traced? This story is an answer. The film starts with a tall office building. The CEO says production must be kept down to keep profits up. They want lawyer Blake to go to Washington to lobby Congress. Will the Trades Reconstruction Corporation bill pass? No; are small industries doomed? Lawyer Jim Blake goes fishing on his vacation. A young girl uses a net to harvest fish from a stream. This breaks the game laws [unknown before the 20th century]. Sharon Brown gives away these fish to the hungry. Blake sees the effects of Federal law on the unemployed workmen in the small village of Springdale, where most stores are out of business. The produce from the farmers can not be packaged and sold, so neither the cannery workers nor the farmers have any money. The consumers don't have money to buy their products. Its a vicious circle that results when workers are oppressed by low wages and high taxes.

Blake has trouble at home. He liquidates his stocks for cash. His wife Ilka is worried, will she make a terrible mistake? Will Blake try to fake his own death with a body in his car. [No comment on this part of the story?] The police close the murder case after they find the burned body in Blakes car. If a competitor buys the railroad how can the canning factory ship its goods? A competitor swears out a warrant against Jim Blake. The film shows how undercover operatives are used to spread rumors and fear. Provocation can get people to act against their own interests. People loot the cannery in a riot. The farmers arrive to stop this. Work together to save yourselves is still good advice. A confession clears Jim Blake. The men who incited the riot are arrested, the canned goods will be delivered by trucks to the railroad depot and then sent to markets across the country. The storys happy ending seems forced.

However the problem of consumption still remains. People with little money cant buy products. Without sales there is a cessation of production. The cause of any recession or depression is the lack of purchasing by consumers. To prevent or cure this you need higher wages and lower taxes on people earning below the median wage. Policies that make the wealthy richer lead to another recession of depression as the night follows the day. This film is a simple lesson in economics told in an entertaining way. It is needed by the many who lack this basic knowledge because of deliberate mis-education. As a murder mystery this story leaves too many loose ends. The name of this movie came from the desire of a President. Can another President make America great again?",1264377600,,2681,4.6758474576271185
2244475,5,B0007UPHRO,"Shot during FDR's first term in office, The Presidents Mystery is essentially an anti-capitalist pro union propoganda film masquerading as a murder mystery. The entire plot and theme was suggested by FDR to a short story writer who then wrote up the mystery into a serial magazine novel before it became a film. The concept was a sensation at the time and because FDR was so loved it became the most popular film of the year. Today it seems a bit dated but I give it 5 stars for its strong historical value.",1154131200,,507,4.462365591397849

8051841,4,B0007UPHRO,"This movie, as I understand it, was based on a short story by FDR.  It is quite obviously a very low budget production (it was released during the depths of the depression, in 1936).  It seems that every scene was filmed in one take.  So it is far from polished.

The story is good.  There are some pretty big details missing (but I understand that this is a too redacted version of the original).  It's sort-of the antithesis of Atlas Shrugged.",1473292800,,445,4.432098765432099
