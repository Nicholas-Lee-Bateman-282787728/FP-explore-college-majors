8005231,3,B00011ZB02,I ordered this because i thought it would be really bad and at the same time fun to watch and what i got were the same results from both films:),1469145600,,144,3.8333333333333335

8005233,3,B00011ZB02,I bought this dvd a few weeks ago because i've never seen Satan Clause and was eager to watch it. Let me just say it's BAD with a capital B. What it reminds me of is a public television movie some teenagers threw together during the weekend to have playing during Halloween and Christmas. First off you can't see anything! The lighting is so dark that it's taxing just to figure out what's going on. I figured they did this so we couldn't be able to tell that all the scenes in this movie are filmed in the same spot. The movie is just a minute over an hour which makes the assumption that this was filmed for public television more close to the truth. The acting is terrible. And the only time you can actually see anything was for establishing shots and Santa's lair and one in an apartment. The ending is a great cop-out that doesn't make sense or fit into any form of reality. Now for Psycho Santa. What a difference between these two movies. Psycho Santa is still a very low budget movie that was shot on video. But the director makes the best of it by building some good suspense and decent story lines. I actually found myself engrossed in the storyline. The director and writers create great suspense and i felt myself on the edge of my seat a couple times. My hope is whoever the team is behind Psycho Santa would go on to make movies for the horror genre with a much bigger budget because i think they could do great things for this genre.,1350950400,,1449,4.311355311355311
8005234,3,B00011ZB02,"Psycho Santa has some elements of suspense that a lot of other independent movies just don't have.  I gave this movie three and half stars.  The biggest downfall to the movie is the 'dead air' time that works for the first couple of scenes to build suspense. The problem is- when you do this with every scene it tends to lose it's momentum.
There is an actual story line that is very original- the Santa used in the movie is actually quite creepy in the way he walks around with a huge knife.  There is a decent amount of gore in the movie.  I don't want to give too much away but I really liked the fact that the movie didn't kill off every single character that runs from the killer- some of them actually do get away and this is refreshing to see in a movie because it's
different especially for this type of movie genre.  I thought the editing ang, lighting and camera angles used in the movie were very good.
I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this B horror movie.  Give it a chance!  With the exception of some dead air time in the movie- the movie flows quite nicely and is filmed quite well.  Of course some of the acting is quite cardboard but for the most part- It's well done.  By the way, the second movie on the disc Satan Claus is EXTREMELY STUPID- Don't even waste your time with this one. The lighting in the movie is HORRIBLE.",1182124800,4,1354,4.237354085603113
