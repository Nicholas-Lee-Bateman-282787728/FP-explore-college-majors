8081589,1,B000B5KX2Y,"To put it simply, this is an amateur-shot Wayne Otto's seminar tape transferred over to a DVD.

No menu. Audio quality is terrible as is the fuzzy/dark video footage, probably shot with one of those cheap camcorders.

Wayne shows a few interesting techniques and comments on his title fights, and, I guess, you could pick up a few things here and there for your kumite training. But any of the positives in terms of content are overshadowed by poor production quality.

I've had a very bad luck with Kombat Klub's DVDs. It looks like it's a company that's ran by some teenager from his/her parents' basement. My advice: stay away from their tapes (even when they call them DVDs).",1140825600,2,679,4.689075630252101
