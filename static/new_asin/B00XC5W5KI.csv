8715679,5,B00XC5W5KI,"Though there is not one bit of that ""In Yo' Face"" 3D (nothing emerges from the screen) but
what I was pleased to discover was a realistically textured presentation with nice separation
between the characters and the background.  There are some fairly impressive 3D moments
in the film such as when Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) is rescuing Flint (Bill Hader) by throwing a
rope down a deep chasm.  To the 3D viewer, the rope has this visual sensation of being suspended
in air.  There are smaller moments where characters placed inside the rescue ship look so lifelike
that you feel as if you could reach inside and touch them.

You are not going to win anyone over on 3D with a bad transfer.  Everything in the 3D world
needs to look meticulous.  This is the big reason why Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs works
so well for this format.  The transfer itself is flawless and rich in colors.  With the 3D eyewear
in place there was a bit of brightness lost, but it seemed to intensify the level of color saturation.
There is a scene where Flint's weather making invention buries the town in snow cones and
ice cream, all brought to life in brilliant colors that bring the viewer into a wonderland of their own.

I saw no ghosting problems within the transfer.

The visually intoxicating experience is well matched with an active DTS-HD track that seems
well detailed and mixed, as well as skillfully placing effect noise in proper channels.

Included are 3D trailers for Open Season and Monster House.

CONCLUSION

When I laid eyes on one of the first animated 3D feature releases to Blu-ray, Monsters
vs. Aliens, I was not especially pleased.  That was a transfer plagued with ghosting
problems.  I was a little apprehensive I would find the same here.  However, I am very
happy to report that Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is flawless, highly enjoyable 3D
content.  Sony seems to be doing some great stuff here and I look forward to giving you
my impressions of Monster House and Open Season in 3D shortly.",1453075200,,2007,4.640226628895184
