The presentation is disjointed with the camera work and commentary sometimes out of sync , creating confusion. For clarity, I believe we ought to be allowed to look at the art work while the commentator is discussing certain features. I can remember several places where the commentator drew my attention to something in a painting while the camera had gone on to picture something else. You really have to already know quite a bit about the artists and the city  to be able to follow this.",1346457600,4,632,4.584070796460177
