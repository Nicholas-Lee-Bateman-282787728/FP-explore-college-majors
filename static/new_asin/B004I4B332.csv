8430040,3,B004I4B332,"Nothing to brag about. The movie is a mixture of political propaganda with some skin thrown in for  good measure. Supposedly set in Columbia it gives me understanding why I don't wanna visit this really crazy country  and experience life in concentration camp first hand. Sure, plenty of people visit Columbia and nothing bad happened to them, sure, I visited Egypt once and nothing bad happened to me but somehow I don't wanna go second time. The main point is political statements and skin are not enough for 21 century, we need something that really changing life to better.",1433980800,,577,4.818181818181818
8430041,2,B004I4B332,"In 1951 Columbia Manuel is a beaten political prisoner who manages to escape. He plans to cross the desert, then the river to political asylum. He is forced to take a rich beautiful hostage, the daughter of people he is revolting against. He treats her with the brutality he has been shown, and later rapes her.

The ending twist was pleasantly unexpected.

The film was a poor transfer and the escape was boring with no subplot.

8430043,3,B004I4B332,"Beautiful woman kidnapped, forced on a cross country trip by mule & by foot.  Suffered rape, humiliation, & maybe a bit of Stockholm Syndrome before being rescued.  She trades her body for their assistance, revenge & eventual release back to her loving, rich father.
Transfer is not very good but watchable.  I watched it with the subtitles.
This is NOT an explicit movie, for those hoping for one.
Would have given it a better rating had the quality of the film been improved upon.  Dont just take any print you can find & burn a disc.  Clean it up.",1316995200,16,550,4.515151515151516
