5837668,5,B00DNR0DPO,The Gathering was filmed in the Ohio town I grew up in. It is a heart warming story and has always been one of my favorite Christmas movies. I am glad to see it on DVD.,1403395200,2,168,3.6944444444444446
5837669,4,B00DNR0DPO,"The Gathering is my favorite Christmas movie but it is never played on television.  I taped it years ago on a VHS and had to watch that version until now.  Ed Asner (Adam) is great as the dying gruff father.  Gregory Harrison plays ""Bud,"" the estranged son.  Bud is a chilled out, likable guy (with dark hair).  The rest of the cast are all very good, especially Lawrence Pressman as ""Tom,"" the other son at odds with the old man.  The Gathering works because of the great script and the actors believeable performances.

On the other hand, The Gathering Part 2 suffers from a poor script and although the same great cast are in this movie (All but you Bud and Toni - and of course Ed Asner) the performances don't work as well.  First of all, Bud is now played by Jameson Parker.  Bud's character is now not pleasant and likeable and he has ""fair"" hair.  Julie and George's kids had platinum blonde hair in the first movie but have jet black hair in part 2.  Continuity problems aside, The Gathering Part 2 is uncomfortable to watch.
Kate (Maureen Stapleton) is being persued romantically by Victor Wainwright (Efram Zimbalist Jr.), a rich executive who the family believe is after Kate's money and Thorton Industries.  There is a ""romantic"" scene with Kate and Victor in his hotel room that will make you squirm. Another scene that is hard to watch is when the family does father's ""famous Christmas recitation.""  Buds' problem with Tom is that Tom fiqured out Dad was dying and Bud didn't, so Bud is grouchy with Tom throughout the film.  Even when they resolve the problem you want to give Bud a slap.
Bruce Davison (George), Rebecca Balding (Julie), Gail Strickland (Peggy) and Veronica Hamel (Helen) are all great in the first one and do admirable jobs in this one, considering the weak script they had to work with.
Too bad they didn't make The Gathering Part 3 where Victor takes Kate for all she's got, Thorton Industries crumbles and the whole family has a pauper's Christmas.  Of course Julie and George's kids have red hair.
The Gathering Part 2 is worth watching for it's unintentional humor.
The Gathering Part 1 is worth watching because it is a great Christmas movie.",1403222400,15,2183,4.6484375

5837687,5,B00DNR0DPO,I just ordered this movie after watching my old taped from TV vhs tape from the 70s that we could barely see! One of my all time favorite Christmas movies because of the stellar cast and a much less sappy  plot than so many holiday movies made for TV have. This movie also causes one to think about what is really important and ponder what choices we might make if we knew our remaining time was limited. So more than just entertainment is provided along with the engaging storyline. A perfect holiday movie for adults and more mature children.,1482710400,,544,4.494949494949495
5837688,5,B00DNR0DPO,I love this movie. I remember watching it as a kid and have been looking for it for a while. I finally found it and bought it just before Christmas. It was better than I remember. Such a sweet story of reconciliation.,1482710400,,217,4.190476190476191

The importance of family at Christmas really hits home. Great cast and directing.

8595221,5,B00DNR0DPO,"We have seen both of these movies several years ago which I taped. But the taped versions have eroded by now, so these DVDs were a very good investment. The first one with Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton is a very good Christmas story. Asner's character is dying from a bad heart, and he wants to see his family for the last time. There are conflicts with how he treated them many years prior, and he left his wife as well. It has a message, and we both found it just as enlightening as when we first saw it.",1517529600,,507,4.1313131313131315
