3941692,5,B002KJAIG0,"I had the privilege of attending a standing-room only screening of ""Bicycle Dreams""  at the Little Roxie in San Francisco earlier this year. This is such an incredible American tale - the cyclists, their teams, the guys who shot this film. It didn't hurt that I was actually sitting behind Shanna Armstrong, the first solo female winner of this race.  I'm a cycling fanatic. I had to own this DVD.  But, this is one of those DVDs that will bring anyone back over and over to watch these riveting stories of people who are each so unique but are all willing to give *everything* for this sport.

You really want ""Bicycle Dreams"" in your library!

3941693,5,B002KJAIG0,"I'm writing with prejudice, I am a cyclist. Never have I witnessed such a crystal clear depiction of what it feels like to spend hours on the bike. I am awed by Auerbach's prospective, he made you feel as if you were there with the RAAM competitors. You felt their pleasure and pain. You understood why they were doing this. This documentary made sense of what could easily be misconstrued as a ridiculous attempt for recognition. It is doubtful that RAAM soloist finishers will ever become famous, but they will have a sense of satisfaction few others will ever achieve.

3941694,5,B002KJAIG0,An incredible film about incredible people doing incredible things.  Take a glimpse into the world of ultra cycling and find out why these amazing people do the things they do.  Be sure to have a box of tissues close by as your emotions will be pushed to unexpected limits as you experience the race alongside the riders and crews struggling with this amazing race. You will never forget the stories held within this film.  A must see for anyone with any sense of adventure!!,1252368000,3,475,4.630952380952381
3941695,5,B002KJAIG0,"One of the greatest documentaries I have ever viewed.  Auerbach brings you into the lives of the riders and the rigors of the event in a most personal way. For anyone interested at the breadth of the human will when confronted with the most grueling circumstances, buy this video.",1252368000,3,280,4.714285714285714
3941696,5,B002KJAIG0,"I was familiar with bicycling's Race Across America Marathon but had never been immersed in the event the way this film allows... This race is truly unlike anything else, an awful test of mankind against his own demons and case of repeatedly pushing oneself to the brink - this film had me in tears more than once and joyful as well.  Hats off to the athletes, their families and supporters, and to the maker of this wonderful film. See it, you will be enriched by the experience...",1252281600,2,482,4.540229885057471
3941697,5,B002KJAIG0,"I learned about Bicycle Dreams from a post on a cycling forum, so when I bought the movie I thought it was going to be a ""cyclist's"" film, focusing on the details of RAAM, the bikes, and the technicalities of the race.  But it isn't so much about RAAM as it is about the people involved in the race - who they are and why they do this amazing event.  Endurance athletes (especially ultra-endurance athletes) are a special group, and the athletes featured in the film are all likeable, easy to watch and, without exception, inspiring in their dedication and toughness.  I've watched this film more times than I can remember, and with each viewing I find it more engrossing and entertaining.  Whether you're a cyclist, an endurance athlete, or just fascinated by people who want achieve far beyond what is considered normal, you'll love Bicycle Dreams. It is well worth watching, again and again.

3941698,5,B002KJAIG0,"Received my copy in the mail today. My wife and I who have both been involved with the race for years were on the edge of our seats for the entire film. We laughed a little and cried a lot, absolutely riveting. We were both standing under that canopy at the BP Station here in Ohio when that ...lightning bolt struck.  We also made homemade signs days in advance of Dr. Bob's anticipated arrival.
This film is about so much more than a bike race.
A MUST HAVE RAAM collection piece!

Kudos to Stephen Auerbach!!",1252108800,2,510,4.3578947368421055
3941699,5,B002KJAIG0,"When I ordered this film, I was already familiar with the Race Across America (RAAM) from my ties with the local American Diabetes Association here in RTP.  One of the founders of Team Type I (TTI) had spoken of RAAM at a recent event with the juvenile diabetes support group.  To hear the effort it took complete RAAM as a team, I could only imagine the effort it would take in the individual competition.  ""Bicycle Dreams"" quickly took the images I formed in my mind about the individual competition and put them into real perspective.  Stephen Auerbach sets the initial stage with interviews of several competitors, but you are not sure if these crazy people have already completed the race or if this was pre-race material.  What really catches you off guard, is the fact that these folks are not crazy.  They are, for the most part, normal cyclists with a desire to compete at the extreme endurance level.  Each one of the profiled riders is slowly introduced and their story developed over the next seven days.  There is no focus on the equipment or anything other than the riders themselves.  Within the first few minutes of actual race coverage, you start to feel like you are part a support team.  As the documentary continues, you are drawn deeper into the fray that is RAAM.  By the end, you are left with utmost respect for those that race.  The photography is on par with most documentaries and it seems at times that there is not a portion of the race that escapes the many embedded camera operators.  As a volunteer photographer for several charity rides in my area, I quickly realize that there is a finite set of shots and inevitably some shots will all start looking the same.  This is somewhat true with the photography in the film, but fine editing and the backdrop of the American landscape distracts from any repeat offender sequences.

This documentary will touch your heart.  The feeling left with me after watching the film is one of great respect for the competitors, their support teams, and families.",1252022400,3,2028,4.7025495750708215
3941700,5,B002KJAIG0,"I LOVE this movie!!
First off I thought the toughest bike race on the planet was the 'Tour de France' - after seeing this film I've learn it's not even close.  This film will inspire you, it will make think, and most important it will help stop the those voices that tell you - 'it can't be done'.  After seeing this film  the world opens up to you - you realize the only thing holding you back from being successful at whatever you choose - is you.  Anyone can do anything once they decide to stop listening to those voices. If you know someone who believes they can't do something - THEY need to see this film.  If your coach, your team needs to see this film.  EVERYONE on the planet would benefit from seeing the men and women in this film tackle a coast to coast (1 stage) race that's 800+ miles longer than the 'Tour de France' and takes place not over 23 days like the Tour but between 8-12 days.  The movie will change you, some more than others, BUT after seeing this film you can't help but come out the other side a changed person - how much??  See the film.",1251417600,,1069,4.180487804878049
3941701,5,B002KJAIG0,"I've been a cyclist for years and have never found a cycling related film that I found engrossing.  I watch the Tour de France but completely understand why the majority of people think it's boring.  ""Bicycle Dreams"", on the other hand, is something I think every athlete, and everyone looking for athletic inspiration, should watch.

The movie follows the riders of the Race Across America (RAAM) but that's about where the cycling related aspects end.  There's no talk about equipment, cycling experience, or the history of the sport.  There's minimal talk even of training.  What the movie is about is the physical and mental suffering the race creates and the competitors experience.  One of the things that surprised me the most is that the movie isn't full of 24 year old professional athletes but ""normal"" people that have chosen an extraordinary challenge to test their limits.  The movie focuses on several riders, all between the ages of 30-50+ that have successful professional careers from teachers to doctors, and all of whom have a family life to balance with their training.

By the end of the movie you feel close to the riders, inspired to push yourself, and if nothing else, sheer awe at the physical strength and mental determination of these riders.  I highly recommend this movie.",1250553600,,1301,4.953917050691245

3941737,2,B002KJAIG0,"I found both this film and the similar ""Race Across America"" boring and unpleasant.  I cared about no one in the films, there is no story nor is there any sense of the magnificent panorama of America rolling by.  At some point, grit and heroics (in a pointless endeavor) reveal the tedious characters of the participants.  I recognize that with distance cycling -- as in other endurance sports -- the capacity to tolerate the suffering is a big part of the endeavor.  Folks who need this are welcome to it, but it is uninteresting as they flatten themselves into this blinkered, one-dimensional obsession.

I have recently returned to cycling as a senior citizen after a half dozen years completely off the bike.  The recovery of fitness is exhilarating, and I find myself beginning to think about more modestly demanding cycling adventures like a 500-mile, non-competitive tour across my own state.  For me, an endeavor of a mere 500 miles (including a couple of mountain days) would be fanatical and desperate and dangerously unhealthy endeavor, although I recognize that it is not at all an unreasonable thing for very fit cyclists who routinely put in a lot of miles.  But I turn away from the siren song of the irrelevantly heroic.  I will challenge myself within reasonable limits and try to extend myself on the bike, but I will not get crazy.  And this RAAM thing is a crazy stunt for anybody.  Anybody who could do it is not someone whom I would like to have a beer with or even care about (or want to watch a film about).

(All of this cannot help but make me reflect on the Tour de France, which I follow and enjoy.  I must say that I have thought a few times that many of the TdF stars are essentially uninteresting and one-dimensional.  The Tour, though, is somewhat redeemed for me by the team aspect and all of the complexity and the various goals within the race short of being the overall GC winner.  And then there is the fact that the athletes do, at least, sleep at night, eat well, and get a lot care.  So it is not like watching to see who can hold his hand in a flame for the longest time.)",1424649600,,2113,4.492146596858639

3941769,4,B002KJAIG0,"This race is insane.  I'm a senior racee, Duathlete, which probably makes me a bit insane.  Further evidence of insanity:  Who at 60 years old goes all out in a race for 2 hours with an average heart rate of 162 BPM?  23 MPH time trialist at age 62?  The point is I do things that make me appreciate athletic endurance.

The movie opened my eyes to how compulsive behavior can be life threatening.  The people who do this race have problems, serious issues.  But who am I to say what is insane and what is not?

This is not a movie about the joys of competition.  It's about the will power of the human being, about the insanity a competition can create, and the horror of what can go wrong when add ride sleep deprived.  There is no joy of victory, just the agony of defeat and victory.

I ride because I love it, not to prove something to anyone.  I compete because I love it, and not to prove anything.  Maybe what I do is no different than those in the movie, but I sure hope so...",1388448000,,985,4.142857142857143

I watched the movie about 5 times over Christmas break.  What I loved most about this was the depiction of the TEAMS of people who support the athletes.  As a triathlete, I know that without your support team, things don't happen.  And it's particularly true for the Race Across America.  Watching how the support crews took care of the athletes, day and night, was eye-opening.  And to see what these athletes go through during such a grueling race...

The cyclists their back up teams and the film maker have made such an amazing film and it has made me inspired to go out on my bike even more well worth watching but have your hankies ready.

It would be impossible.
Really one of those ""Had to have been there, done that and gotten the T-Shirt"", kind of things.
 I truly believe that Stephen Auerbach has captured, what would have to be, the closest thing, to actually being there and participating in the RAAM!

I have told so many people about this film.
My message to them is always the same...
That you do not have to be a cyclist to enjoy this film.
 It is a film that truly captures the heart of the ""Human Spirit"".
It shows, more than any film that I have ever seen, how we, as humans are capable of achieving ANYTHING, that we put our minds to.
ANYTHING!!!

However, the film is really about people, not only racers who would train and enter the race, but also the people supporting the riders both near and far.  We glimpse the riders' lives, people they love and who also sacrifice for them so they can also sacrifice.  Through all these people and their interviews, we see some of the meaning of life, the philosophy behind it, lessons learned, many through blood and sweat and happiness and sadness.  I still personally reflect on the film long after the viewing.

The content and structure of the film are what turned me off.  The cast of characters in the film keeps expanding as it runs, and that gave the initial impression that the field of riders was smaller than it actually was.  The rambling nonsense that comes from exhausted rider's mouths isn't helpful - I think the film could have used more external analysis and a consistent point of view intellectually.  Even documentaries can have a point of view, and don't have to focus exclusively on the participants of the even.

But just think of racing across America, San Diego to Atlantic City, note I say RACING ACROSS AMERICA, or RAAM, did I say non stop, if your sleeping, you are losing time, this is a race.  The record is 8 days, 8 days to ride over 3,000 miles, the record average speed is 15mph, up the Rockies, stop lights, stop signs, 8 days of racing.
What would that take, who the heck would sign up for this?
They do about the same distance in the Tour de France, but over 21 days, and they sleep every night.

I've also met and ridden with several of the legends of RAAM from the early years including Pete Penseyres and Lon Haldeman.  All of them were pretty normal people who just liked to ride their bikes for very long distances.  This film on the other hand concentrates on the crazy people that are hard to associate with.  What is the point of this?  I found this movie boring as a result because in the end I was only interested in a couple of the riders who I could associate with (one of them died half way through).  My wife and I actually stopped watching the movie the first time after 15 minutes and only continued a couple days later because of all the raving reviews I read on Amazon.  In the end it was not worth almost 2 hrs of my time.  There was basically nothing in the movie about my favorite sport, cycling, and little about the event RAAM (history for example).  I guess I'm not really into movies about 'why' crazy people like to suffer which seemed to be the point of this movie.

Well, Bicycle Dreams doesn't have any of that. It does, however, almost show a rider being killed - thankfully, not the crash itself, but the reactions of the fellow participants in real time. Not entirely tasteful I think.

Hell on Wheels, while following the 2003 Tour de France, cleverly avoids showing the podium scenes, time standings etc. - a trick that seems especially brilliant now that we know what happened to the overall winner. Bicycle Dreams, of course, keeps telling the race positions all the time. Think reality tv rather than arthouse cinema...

I've been aware of RAAM since 1982, and have been biking for fitness with my family since the '60's. (All too well I remember the days of being run off the road by cars. I'm mentioning this for cycling ""street cred."") RAAM isn't for the faint hearted--even the movie is not for the faint hearted! The pain and madness of endurance cycling comes across vividly, as the riders traverse heat-shimmering deserts and endless, broiling cornfields. They ride up mountains and then snatch a few minutes of sleep in vans and RV's (depending on financial condition). The solo riders are men and women who are in a class all their own, physically and mentally, and as 3,000+ mile journey proves, questors seeking a personal grail. My only quibble is that it's a bit too long, but I certainly can understand the filmmaker's commitment to his story. I'd recommend this DVD to any cyclist, any sport's minded, or solitary sort of kid, or to anyone who wants to understand what, down at the core, American cycling is all about.",1330300800,,1223,4.746478873239437

This is what Bicycle Dreams captures by its essence.  Whether you ride long distances or not, heck, even if you haven't ridden a bike in 20 years, buy this film.  It embodies the deeper struggle of our human existence as we strive, struggle and learn from our failures.  Sports are a great metaphor for life at large, the greatest of these are endurance sports, with Bicycle Dreams taking you into a greater understanding of what it means to reach for the brass ring, no matter how big, no matter how small.  If you don't learn something about yourself and about life by simply watching this film, well, you need to do it again because you weren't paying attention.  Life changes in a heartbeat, in one moment you think all is lost, that perseverence is not to be had, then, in a moment, something happens.

The ride itself is amazing (and in moments, VERY sad).  The directors did a good job on highlighting several of the riders, including the winner.  The sad thing about this documentary is two of the cyclists have passed away since the making.  One during (sorry to burst the story), and the winner, which passed away soon after the making, from a training ride at his country (he was a great loss to the ultra cycling sport).  It will inspire you, not to ride, but to experience briefly a true athletes life, and dedication.  I still ride, and run; but I thank God I come home injury free.

3941846,3,B002KJAIG0,"While this film introduces the world to the madness that is the RAAM and the determination of the riders, I feel there are some key elements missing from the film. I first found out about this race and the film while listening to a RadioLab podcast about limits, where they discussed the limitations of humans, physically, mentally, and emotionally. The segment about the RAAM was moving and I wanted to know more, while experiencing the Elevation I was from the podcast, which brought me to the film.

The film follows the trials of a handful of riders from start to finish. It focuses more on the personal, and almost disconnects from the topic, questioning the abilities and decisions only indirectly and subtly. This film, however, needs a few additional things: narration, increased production value (most of the shots were done with a poor-quality SD camera), and details about not only the riders but also the race. I wanted to know how they prepare for it, the things they eat, statistics, ways they stay focused, engaged, etc. Besides, the film could have been made to be much more gut-wrenching, with the right music director and better editing.

3941848,2,B002KJAIG0,"If you're into hazing, you might like this movie.  The bicycle dreams in this movie were more like bicycle nightmares.  RAAM stands for Race Across America (Marathon?)  The goal is to cycle across America as fast as one can.  When it was over I felt as if I had witnessed a crime.  Nine days of around-the-clock cycling with a total of only ten-or-so hours of sleep is not extreme athleticism, it's extreme insanity.  When the riders complained that they were dying, they were serious.  The one death that did occur was treated as a sad and unfortunate aspect of a contest that includes hallucinations, vomiting, passing out, severe cramping, spinal cord trauma, pneumonia, and other obvious symptoms of distress.

As a documentary, it succeeded in illustrating a journey into pathological obsession.  I was expecting to see Lance Armstrong, Levi Leipheimer, George Hincapie, somebody from pro-cycling, but instead I saw several dozen men and one woman push themselves to the brink of death.  This odyssey would have been more inspiring and enjoyable to watch if the competitors, who were clearly committed to the event, would have had preset stages to win.

I love a movie that has a beginning, a middle and an end. This one delivers. Bicycle Dreams refers to the fantasy that these sleepless bike racers envision and embody.  Yet this film is no fantasy. This is a reality film. You see the gut-wrenching, sweaty, physical and mental toll this race takes on riders, crews, and their families. How do they do it? Why do they do it? You feel their pain. You are exhausted at the end. You crave sleep.  It's captivating, enthralling, intimidating, heart-wrenching and adventurous.

Before the film started I was a little concerned it would not hold their interest and we would end up going home early. I shouldn't have worried because they were totally into it from the start.  Afterwards they talked about how amazing the cyclists were and how real stories were better than made-up ones.

We had the added bonus of having one of the videographers for the film (Jessie Luna) introduce it and answer questions afterwards.

3941927,5,B002KJAIG0,"This film comes the closest I've seen to capturing the essence (in its complicated layers) of the human heart. What makes people desire something? How do they keep desiring it in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles? The drama, the pain, and the incredibly intimate moments captured on camera make for a documentary of stunning insight. I will never forget the French rider pulling off the road and saying ""I'm done. I wanted to test my limits and I saw them. But I have a wife and kids. RAAM isn't worth it."" Stephen Auerback has created a film that will move anyone, not just cyclists or extreme sports enthusiasts. The film isn't about cycling, it's about the human condition.",1256083200,,689,4.798319327731092
3941928,5,B002KJAIG0,"This movie contains an outstanding message, delivered in a way that is accurate, compelling and balanced. It is also riveting. The story is fascinating because of the clever choices made by Steven Auerbach. He chose diverse riders, with different reasons to ride; he used many complimentary cinematographic techniques; he featured a broad cross-section of the ride segments; and he chose to leave in the most physically and mentally uncomfortable moments in the journey of the most interesting riders. I watched this movie with my teenage son, who rides with me. He summed it up: ""you really can't predict which people will achieve the impossible"". A really fine sports movie, both in concept and execution.",1256083200,,707,5.2105263157894735
3941929,5,B002KJAIG0,"i originally heard about the movie through a FaceBook comment (and link) from a friend and checked out the preview online and thought it was awesome! I purchased two copies, one for a friend and another for myself. Anyone that has participated in endurance cycling will completely relate to the stories in this extremely well done documentary of one of the world's toughest endurance events. Commentary from the riders and their teams is great and keeps you riveted to your seat. I brought this along on an overnight cycling event that we had a couple of weeks ago with our cycling club, a relatively short ride (by comparison to RAAM) of 150 miles and 12,000 feet of climbing...everyone loved it and I think I sold a number of copies that evening as they all wanted their own copy. If you ride, this is one that you'll want to have in your collection. Well done Stephen and when is the next one coming out?",1255651200,,907,4.570552147239264
3941930,5,B002KJAIG0,"You need not be a cyclist to embrace this movie. It is not about bikes or gear. Yes, it portrays 10 cyclists who have little in common except their desire to finish RAAM. But at its heart this movie is about these athletes' will to prevail, to endure, to love, to depend, to trust, and to survive. The cyclists -- their stories, words, and pictures -- are the soul of this exceptional movie.

Auerbach uses words, scenes, and music beautifully to tell their collective and very personal stories. We see them ride past exhaustion, in and out of hallucination, literally asleep on their bikes. We see intimate camera shots while they argue with their incredible crews or are being cared for like babies during a 10 minute nap. We witness a terrible tragedy and its effect on each cyclist. With each mile, the existential questions each cyclist faces in his or her own personal stupor become more and more real.

By the time each cyclist finishes, we feel privileged to have glimpsed their extremely personal highest and lowest moments, of triumph and despair. We learn the power of pure, driving motivation. And we are more confident of our own capacity for hope and ability to prevail.

3941931,5,B002KJAIG0,"Stephen Auerbach had such challange to make this film what it has become. Not only did he capture what how difficult and pure this race is, he also ended up honoring a great man.  I met Bob Breedlove when I dated his daughter and rode RAGBRAI with him in 1998.  He has always been and inspiration to me on and off of the bike.

I feel that Stephen did Bob a great justice in the way that he scripted the film. If you were to spend more than 5 minutes with Bob, one could only imagine the struggle to make it inspiring.

Thanks again for the film. Having missed those last 5 days of Bob's life would have been even more tragic.

Even after watching the film, I plan to try my luck at this grueling race!!!",1254096000,,704,4.109489051094891
3941932,5,B002KJAIG0,"What an amazing story this film tells.  Inspiration, humor, tragedy - the experiences this film tells run the gamut of emotion.  I enjoy distance cycling myself but few people have kind of mettle this group has.  This film most adroitly portrays the experience through the minds of riders and the 'family' of support behind each participant.  It is a must see for anyone who can appreciate a sporting event of this nature as a microcosm of the totality of the human experience.  Thank you Mr. Auerbach.",1254096000,,502,4.790697674418604
3941963,5,B002KJAIG0,"Bicycle Dreams will send chills up your spine. It is not pretty, but is full of pain, sweat, a few looggies and even death, but it is the realest and perhaps most pure thing caught on film in quite some time. Any athlete, no matter their sport, will recognize the obsession that is clearly displayed by the subjects of this film. Non-cyclists will get a glimpses into the soul of those strange people you see riding down the road in the middle of nowhere. Buy this film, watch it and welcome to the world of endurance cycling where we are all lunatics. I will see you on the road.",1253750400,,580,4.330275229357798
3941964,4,B002KJAIG0,"As a cyclist who has been aware of RAAM since the beginning, I was really looking forward to this movie. They showed it at a local velodrome, and I missed the screening, so I bought the DVD. The movie is everything a documentary should be: Informative, touching, inspiring. I was continually shaking my head in amazement at the ordeal to which these athletes willingly chose to subject themselves.

However, I only give ""Bicycle Dreams"" four stars (wish it could be four-and-a-half) for a few reasons:

1. I would have liked to set the context a little better. For obvious reasons, Auerbach focuses on just a few cyclists in the race. But other than an establishing shot at the beginning, we have no idea how many people are actually riding. I know in the first RAAM in 1982 (back when it was the Great American Bike Race), there were just four competitors. It is mentioned that 288 people had ridden RAAM in the 24 years between that first race and when the movie was made. That averages to 12 per year. Yet we only meet half a dozen riders. It would have been nice to have ALL the competitors briefly introduced at the beginning, and then see their status at the end. (Also, that 288 number apparently applies only to the solo race category. There are 20 different categories, including eight-man teams, so that figure isn't quite accurate.)

2. Like so many documentaries, this one follows the sequence of set-up, exposition, interview, repeat. It is an effective storytelling device. But after a while, I started to lose track of who was who, or the relationship they had to one another. There was one trainer shown at the beginning (and a few times in the middle), who I didn't realize was actually participating in the race until near the end.

3. As a DVD, I would have liked some extras. I actually rarely watch extras, but this time, I would have loved to see more of the unused interview footage, maybe old press footage from when RAAM was covered on national TV, an interview with the founders of the race (even from old footage), etc. The fact that Jure Robic has gone on to win the race twice more is amazing and the sort of thing that could be mentioned in a DVD extra.

In any case, this is still a great film and very much worth watching. I hope it is entered for Oscar consideration in the documentary category this year. It certainly deserves a nomination. I found it as moving and exhilarating as last year's winner, ""Man on Wire.""",1253491200,5,2450,4.571753986332574
3941965,5,B002KJAIG0,"This is more than a movie about bicycling. It's about the human spirit and what it can accomplish. I've ridden a bike across the country (although I took three times as long), so I can testify to the enormity of the challenge these riders race. Compared to them, my struggles are easy, I am never tired and my saddle is comfortable!",1253145600,,332,4.459016393442623
3941966,5,B002KJAIG0,This film is a winner on several levels. Just the scope of the film making would make this a must see. Covering an event like RAAM  that lasts over 10days and giving the viewer such personal access to the riders makes this a filmatic masterpiece. When I walked out of the theater after seeing this film I felt emotionally drained (in a good way). I have shown it to several of my non cycling friends and they couldn't stop talking about this film.,1252886400,,447,4.385542168674699

3941968,5,B002KJAIG0,"When I saw this movie described on a cycling website I frequent, I knew I had to see it.  Yes, I'm an endurance cyclist, not a very good one, but a passionate one.  This movie portrays just about everything a long distance cyclist endures while riding across America.  The physical challenge is immense, but it's the mental challenge that can put one over the edge.  This group of cyclists, some unknown to each other, come together to challenge themselves.  One doesn't understand their motivations until you see this movie, but once you get to know them individually, it becomes more clear.  Yet, you wonder, and they do too, why they really do it and if it's worth it.  Only they can answer that question.  See this movie even if you're not a cyclist.

3941970,5,B002KJAIG0,Worth the $19.95. If your into cycling or endurance events then you have got to see this film. It captures the human spirit and is very well documented. Tragic and Inspiring.,1252800000,,174,4.645161290322581
3941971,5,B002KJAIG0,"If you have ever dreamed about RAAM or just wondered what it takes, this is the DVD for you.  I laughed, I cried but most of all, I was truly inspired by greatness.  The film doesn't explain how they do the things they do, but offers a tiny bit of insight into why.  If you have an ultra athlete in your life, this is the perfect gift.  I've watched it countless times, each and every time I enjoy it more than the time before.",1252627200,,427,4.0476190476190474

3941990,5,B002KJAIG0,"I was expecting a simple documentary about the hardest cycling (and probably all-time sporting) event in the world.  And while this film does justice to the race itself, the film really shines in its portrayal of the all of the people involved.  It's more than just the racers.  It's the families, the support crews, the organizers, the people in the towns across this country.  It's about complex emotions.  It resulted in laughter, awe and tears.  Beyond the great story lines, the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack and the narration are fantastic.  This is way beyond the usual race coverage that you've come to expect if all you watch is Tour de France coverage.  Most cyclists buy cycling related movies to watch while riding the rollers during the off-season.  This movie is not your best choice for that, but it will become one of your favorites while dreaming about your bicycle.",1252627200,,897,4.926666666666667
3941991,5,B002KJAIG0,I am a cyclist and runner and enjoy films about both.  I watched this film with my 18-year-old son and we were in awe of the cylists.  I'm still amazed at what they went through in their journey across the US. While I think they're quite mad -- it was fasinating and inspiring.  I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection!,1252627200,,333,4.338709677419355
3941992,5,B002KJAIG0,"I have enjoyed riding my bicycle as a kid and an adult.  I started riding again in 2006 and was fortunate to find some adult riders with the same passion.  They motivated me to ride much farther and faster at age 47 than I did at age 27.

I got interested in doing the RAIN (Ride Across Indiana) which is 160 miles in one day.  While I was searching for training advice I found the RAAM website and got very interested in the race and read all that I could about it.  After I complete RAIN, if I could do it 18 more times, add a 1000,000+ feet of climbing and deserts and ride with a couple hours sleep per day (at most) I could do RAAM.  I cannot even begin to comprehend.

When I found out about the movie I could not wait for it to become available.  It really captures the true essence of the race and gives me even more appreciation for the massive effort and mental toughness this event requires and the toll it takes upon it's participants.  Breaking Away and American Flyers are movies about bicycle racing.  Bicycle Dreams is about an Ultra Durance event that is in a whole other world and in a class by itself.  I recommend it highly.

The soundtrack is simple but awesome also and much more than I expected for a documentary.  It is so well done and captivating that I watch it over and over which is more than I can say for the even the best movies that I have purchased.  I will have to look and see what other projects that Steven Auerbach has done.  If they are even close to Bicycle Dreams they would be worth watching also.",1252627200,,1540,4.208191126279863
3941993,5,B002KJAIG0,"I thought I was prepared for the material in this film.  I mean I've been reading about the RAAM since it's inception  and I knew it was basically a masochistic exercise in sleep deprivation and exhaustion.  But the director makes you intimately involved with the players.  Not just the riders and the systematic demolition of their physical and mental abilities but the enormous effort of the support staff for these riders and the emotional battering they go through to keep the riders on the road.  I almost quit watching at the shocker halfway through the film because it hit me in hard the pit of the gut.  But you keep watching, in hope and morbid facination to see what happens next. The director doesn't always show you what is happening but you know, even more acutely, because he shows you how it affects the players in the film.  By the end you are as exhausted as the teams who finish and you feel the same endorphin high tempered with I'm-glad-it's-over-but man-what-a journey!

This is a first class film and will be of interest to cyclists, extreme athletes of any sport, students of the human psyche, and those who would like to personally see where the limits of human endurance are found.",1252627200,8,1206,4.682464454976303

Auerbach's movie gives an up-close and personal view of what drives the cyclists who pedal across deserts, mountain ranges and plains coast-to-coast in the Race Across America.

You feel their pain and personal struggles, you cry over their tragedies and you share their exhilaration when they finish.  You hear in their own words what makes them push themselves beyond normal human limits.

By the end, you'll know the answer to the question: What do you call the last cyclist to cross the RAAM finish line?
