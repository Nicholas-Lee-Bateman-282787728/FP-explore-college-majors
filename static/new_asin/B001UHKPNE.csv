3798358,2,B001UHKPNE,I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia and was looking for an exercise DVD I could do.  This one is not suitable for anyone with limited mobility.  If you have just been sedentary and want to get back in shape it is a good choice.,1280361600,4,236,4.340909090909091

I did the standing version, but a person who would rather sit can do the program sitting. I also like that this program is very therapeutic, is doctor recommended and as a result offers pain relief for aching joints. Definately recommend as a favorite arthritis program.",1268784000,8,537,7.2615384615384615
3798360,5,B001UHKPNE,"I'm the host of Functional Fitness on PBS and really enjoyed putting over 25 years of experience into this Functional Fitness Arthritis DVD to help you live better and without pain.  I'm proud to be able to offer you medically proven techniques to help you get back to life.  I was deeply inspired when a 30 year old female patient came to me because the doctor told her she would be in a wheelchair in 5 years from her rheumatoid arthritis.  I worked with her 5 days a week using the methods in Functional Fitness Arthritis and today she is pain free and walking just fine.  That was 10 years ago. I had another patient who was in a wheelchair because of the intense arthritis pain and after 12 weeks of these exercises, she was able to walk and go home and live on her own.  She was 90! To me helping others is the greatest success.
Healthiest Blessings,

Now that I'm properly stretched out and have learned how to take better care of myself, thanks to Functional Fitness Arthritis, I'm walking easier and enjoying myself more in every aspect of my life.

3798365,2,B001UHKPNE,"I have found many beginner yoga, pilates, and low impact routines on DVD that were much more effective, and hip arthritis-friendly than this one.  It alternated between exercises that were far too easy (I have taught Pilates myself for many years, so except for the arthritis pain I am in relatively good shape though a little overweight now that the hip issues have slowed me down) and exercises that I could not do because of the limits to my range of motion.  It was quite ""hokey"" too; not very professionally done.

3798382,5,B001UHKPNE,"I purchased this DVD/CD from a PBS pledge show and it's really terrific.  The DVD has exercises to help with joint pain in your back, neck,  shoulders, hands and/or your hips, so if you have arthritis in a specific area, the DVD menu gives you the option.  Or you can just hit play and do the whole thing. Also has a cd that you can play by the pool to instruct you as you do the exercises. The quality of the images is the best I've ever seen underwater - very clear so there's no guess work. As far as the ""frozen smiles"" the other person commented on, I welcome a smiling face.  If you prefer the drill type of instructor who screams and barks orders at you, this is not the dvd for you.  It's soothing. Specially after a hard day at work, I find this program good for stress release.",1366243200,16,787,4.151315789473684

Her presentation of how to follow along in the work out is so safe, she is so clear and easy to understand. I just love her video and how easy this is to follow along. Suzanne's gentle targeting of the shoulders and rhomboid major muscle groups really works for me and my arthritis condition. You can watch her DVD and then go to your pool and practice. Suzanne and Glenn are perfect instructors so full of vitality and it is that positive inspirational energy that drives me back to repeat all of her classes again.

Suzanne Andrews is a licensed rehabilitation therapist so I feel comfortable under her direction. There are exercises to help the knees, hips, hands, neck and shoulders, and because she offers two different levels for each move you can start out as a beginner and still have room to grow within the program. I really love the audio CD, it is perfect at guiding me while I do exercises in the pool.

3798389,5,B001UHKPNE,"I have suffered with arthritis for longer than I care to remember. My doctor has always stressed how important exercise is to relieving my joint pain, but when I'm suffering, I don't tend to want to workout. That all changed when a good friend told me to try the Functional Fitness Arthritis DVD. I was skeptical, I must admit, and figured it was just one of those fly by night exercise videos with no real potential for easing my aching joints. I am pleased to say I was wrong. This DVD has given me so much relief. I can't tell you enough how grateful I am that the creators of this fitness routine put this out there on DVD for arthritis sufferers. The exercises are easy to do and what I like most is the fact I can workout from the comforts of a chair if I am having a particulary painful day and don't feel like standing. For me, the Functional Fitness DVD has helped with stiffness that used to keep me laying around most of the day. I now have more energy and my joints move so much easier with very little stiffness most days. I feel like walking and doing things around the house. I'm even going out with friends and family more often. Never in a million years would I have guessed an exercise DVD would provide so much relief, but I'm glad I listened to my friend and tried this DVD. My arthritis is so much better. Thank you again to the creators of Functional Fitness.",1326153600,36,1381,4.295019157088123

3798391,5,B001UHKPNE,"I've had numerous back operations and enjoyed Suzanne Andrews other DVD's so I thought I'd try this one because I prefer to exercise at home. I've been through physical therapy and needed to continue my exercises. She offers you a choice of doing the exercises sitting or standing.  My mobility has improved a lot and she explains everything really well. So even if you don't have great mobility, if you keep doing it you will. But there is a catch, you have to do the program and not let it sit around collecting dust!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Functional-Fitness-Arthritis/dp/B001UHKPNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Functional Fitness Arthritis</a>",1280448000,2,697,6.040404040404041

8343674,5,B001UHKPNE,"Both of the workouts on this DVD are suitable for the 50+ age group.

I like doing these with my husband when I get home from work. I do a more vigorous workout in the morning but he doesnt do any workout in the morning. He is a remodeling contractor and is active throughout the day. He has good upper and lower body strength but his flexibility is not so good and he is beginning to suffer from arthritis. This causes aches and pains. These workouts are doable for him. He feels better afterwards.

The anti-aging workout is the easier of the two and consists mainly of gentle stretches. It begins with a standing routine and ends with a floor routine. I believe the joint integrity is all standing. It involves more movement. You use a ball, a lemon and a stretchy band. We substituted a pillow for the ball and a tennis ball for the lemon.

This is a great DVD for PM, preventative maintenance, to keep from suffering from the aches and pains of arthritis by retaining your flexibility.",1503360000,,990,4.458563535911602

8343680,5,B001UHKPNE,I have Suzanne Andrews Arthritis Walking Workout DVD from Amazon and got this dvd from another site.  the menu gives you a choice to do the workout with music or without music and also the option to skip the introduction and go directly to the exercises.  Music is relaxing an exercises helped with my joint pain (all over) when I can't get to my pool. 5 stars because it helps me move and get around better and I really like the gentle manner of the instructor.,1443484800,,462,4.3604651162790695
