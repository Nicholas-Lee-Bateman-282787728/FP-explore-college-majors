5459278,5,B00ANDFL3A,Good set of movies,1425600000,,18,3.75
5459279,3,B00ANDFL3A,"I bought this set for the cheesy '70s classic ""Logan's Run"". The box says that it's widescreen, but it's not. It's the full screen format. It's also not the best video/audio quality.

The other 3 films are widescreen as advertised. They all look and sound fine, commercial dvd quality. Some have extras.

Good set of fun movies for a cheap price.",1422921600,8,346,4.655737704918033

5459281,5,B00ANDFL3A,"Watched Logan's Run, which I haven't seen in years.  It was as good as I remember it.  I also like Omega Man and I am Legend, even though it doesn't follow the book exactly.  My daughter recommended Dark City.  4 great movies in one place.",1420588800,5,239,4.2444444444444445

5459284,5,B00ANDFL3A,"I bought this for Dark City, but ended up enjoying the other movies too - especially the Omega Man+I Am Legend tie it.",1408406400,,118,4.173913043478261
5459285,5,B00ANDFL3A,"This disk contains four really great films.  Omega Man and I Am Legend are two of the three movies based ion the Richard Matheson novel I Am Legend (the third being The Last Man On Earth staring Vincent Price).  Dark City is a dark and spooky sci-fi flick with a few nifty twists.  Logan's Run is a classic that has stood the test of time.  Each film has it's own disc and, though short on bonus features, are all good quality prints.  This is a great buy for anyone who loves classic sci-fi as well as the newer entries to the genre.",1386288000,20,534,4.196078431372549

5459288,5,B00ANDFL3A,"I bought this for Dark city and Omega Man, intend to watch ""Logan's Run"" someday.

For the price, having a lousy movie (or two) in the bunch is no biggie.",1493251200,,154,4.133333333333334
5459289,1,B00ANDFL3A,The only movie in this selection worth watching is I Am Legend. The other movies are as cheesy as can be. Safe your money and just get I am Legend.,1492992000,,147,3.933333333333333
5459290,5,B00ANDFL3A,I like these movies. Great value packet,1489708800,,39,4.714285714285714
5459291,3,B00ANDFL3A,"Buyer beware! If you prefer the letterbox version of movies and care if Logan's Run is letterbox or panscan - don't purchase this version. While Omega Man and I am Legend are both letter box, Logan's Run is panscan, which means I will be repurchasing it.... You can get a bluray of Omega Man and I Am Legend for $9 at the time of this writing. I have not watched Dark City (had never heard of it before) and had purchased this disk for the other three movies. I would have been better off purchasing the bluray combo and the Logan's Run DVD for $5 which I am now going to have to purchase to replace the panscan version included in this set.",1485216000,6,641,4.219512195121951

5459294,5,B00ANDFL3A,"I completely enjoyed watching the movie ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith.  Even though it was science fiction Will's wonderful presence  made it feel more believable, like that could be you getting through each day with your dog by your side thinking that you were the last human on earth.  This movie alone would make the purchase well worth it and yet there are three more to watch..  I haven't had time to watch the other three yet but hopefully they are as good as the first one.",1464307200,,484,4.465909090909091

5459297,5,B00ANDFL3A,"A fun pact of Post Apocalypse films stretching from the 60's through the 2000's. None of these is earth shattering, but they sure are interesting to kick back and watch.",1461974400,,169,4.666666666666667

8554636,5,B00ANDFL3A,The Omega Man is an awesome movie. I Am Legend stinks on ice. Logans Run is a good movie. Ive never seen Dark City. I would pay $9.99 for The Omega Man alone.,1520553600,,158,3.8181818181818183
8554637,5,B00ANDFL3A,"This review will cover the disk set itself rather than the contents.  I assume most potential buyers would know the movies they are buying.  I watched all four movies over a weekend.  All of the disks were in perfect shape and the movies played without problem.  At this price, this set is a steal!",1516147200,,298,4.462962962962963
8554638,3,B00ANDFL3A,"All 4 films are great! However, LOGAN'S RUN IS NOT WIDESCREEN. All others are as advertised.",1514678400,,92,4.8125
8554639,5,B00ANDFL3A,"So fyi Omega Man is the original I am Legend. By today's standards Omega Man seems hokey, but when it came out it was as cutting edge as I am Legend. Logan's Run is another old SciFi that hasn't aged that well, but still a decent movie for a rainy or snowy day. Dark City is an interesting movie and you will probably love it or hate it.",1510012800,,337,3.9705882352941178
8554640,5,B00ANDFL3A,"Quality, good movies. Specifically bought it for Dark City (LOVE it) and Logan's Run but I might check the others out.",1507248000,,118,4.666666666666667
8554641,4,B00ANDFL3A,Great 4pack. The only problem is cheesy Will Smith in Iam Legend.,1505779200,,65,4.5
