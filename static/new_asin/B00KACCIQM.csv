6408849,5,B00KACCIQM,"In a nutshell...
First, you should understand where the term, ""Penny Dreadful,"" came into being. During the Victorian Era (in the 1890s), London had just experienced the horrors of Jack the Ripper, and with the public's growing thirst for newspapers and magazines, more and more serialized stories began to appear in these magazines. You could buy them for a penny, and usually the stories were dreadfully written, hence ""Penny Dreadfuls."" BUT, take note, here; ""Penny Dreadful 2014"" is definitely NOT dreadfully written. Believe me, this Penny Dreadful contains only the best horror characters from the best writers in horror fiction (Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,  among others), and they all appear in A SINGLE STORYLINE, resulting in a more three-dimensional plot, which will definitely hold your interest.

""Penny Dreadful 2014"" takes place in 1891, and is a more CREATIVE, much DARKER, more MATURE horror tale, than what you may be used to seeing on TV. Sure, it includes some of the biggest names in classic horror, all in one creepy horror tale, with many more refreshing and deadly twists, than ever seen before, but this is exactly what I have yearned for. I do not like ""formula television,"" and I value a new approach - especially when it is a good one. Penny Dreadful is exactly my kind of story. The classic monsters are so much more interesting, when they are not held to the old standards (example: this Frankenstein monster speaks perfect English), and with this creepy, darker approach to storytelling, they dominate the screen even more.

The acting is excellent; the writing is superb, and as a series goes, there is more time to develop the plot, the characters, and the eerie atmosphere of mists and shadows, that keep you on the edge of your seat. I am already having trouble waiting a week for a new episode. Penny Dreadful is very promising, and if you like a refreshingly new, really good horror tale, with awesome special effects, you will like this one.",1400803200,438,2034,4.958944281524927
6408850,4,B00KACCIQM,"Penny Dreadfuls of the Victorian era were the equivalent of pulp fiction in the 1930s and grindhouse movies in the 1970s. They were gory, overly dramatic, and not meant to be taken seriously. This show stays true to that format. My husband and I had fun watching the first episode and picking out the tribute characters: Dr Frankenstein was the most obvious, but Josh Harnett's character reminded us of Agent Tom Sawyer from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Eva Green's character reminded us of Mina Harker from the same. I liked Eva Green's character a lot - when she's with other people. When she's alone with Jesus then it is like she is a whole other person. It was silly and suspenseful and the setting and costumes were all fascinating. Unfortunately only the first episode was available on YouTube and we don't have Showtime or a Blu-ray player, so that's it for us.",1400716800,3,879,4.751633986928105
6408851,5,B00KACCIQM,"Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s Hammer Studios rebooted a lot of classic monsters first made famous by Universal --Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, assorted werewolves, vampires, and ghouls. Hammer made a lot of sequels, taking Christopher Lee's Dracula all the way to the present, while Peter Cushing's Frankenstein Created Woman and made a Monster From Hell.

But unlike Universal, Hammer never made their own mash-ups, something like Frankenstein Meets Dracula or The Mummy vs. The Man Who Could Cheat Death.

Now we have Penny Dreadful to fill that void, a fun series where a whole bunch of creatures and concepts clash and mash, all done with a psycho-sexual undertone very familiar to Hammer fans.  The performances are great Josh Hartnet has come into his own and Eva Green is the Barbara Steele of the 21st Century. Rory Kinnear makes a great Frankenstein's monster, and Harry Treadaway a crazy mixed up Dr. Frankenstein who is both sexually repressed and a junkie. And I love Simon Russell Beale as Victorian scholar Ferdinand Lyle. Thanks to Showtime for giving us this fun series, and the more serious but just as entertaining Masters of Sex.",1400544000,44,1151,4.984375

There is not one original idea in this mess. The ""writers""  steal ideas from a half dozen classic English novels.
They combine them, and not at all successfully, into one big steaming pile.

6408853,5,B00KACCIQM,"The cynic in me is dead.  Long live Penny Dreadful!  I do not want to sound like I am giving you a lot of hyperbole but it's difficult not to. I have not liked a show this much since I first discovered Dark Shadows when I was thirteen-years-old.

Penny Dreadful begins with a slow burn pace but by the end of episode 2 everything had kicked into gear.  I cannot put into words how well this show has taken my breath away. I would like to fully apologize for the doubts I had toward it upon seeing the early preview clips.  I was utterly wrong.  Nothing is what it seems and this show is the best Gothic Horror TV series I have seen in years.

After dealing with the mediocre and pandering likes of Bitten and NBC's Dracula I had all but given up hope on my favorite genre of fiction but Penny Dreadful salvaged my faith in creativity.

Penny dreadful is named for the 19th century slang term for a cheap pulp novel or serial such as Varney The Vampire or other Gothic classics that were originally often published in installments.  Most of these works of literature dealt with terrifying and morbid premises and so were ""dreadful"" and obviously only cost a penny.

The TV series Penny Dreadful pits the likes of Victor Frankenstein, his creation, the immortal Dorian Gray (from the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde) and the characters of Dracula all in the same late nineteenth century setting.

The show has managed to surprise me already within it's first two episodes and it keeps me guessing.

The show is well acted with impressive and realistic production values.  It also bears detailed and clever writing.  Subtle nods to other works of classic literature are scattered through out in delightful Easter Egg quotes and references.  Also so far I have not caught a single glimpse of computer generated monster effects.  No.  Everything I have seen thus far has been done with skillful and realistic practical effects so that everything feels real and  tactile.  There is no cheap, cartoonish or watery CG to draw me out of the story.

I cannot put into words how much I love this show and hope that the third episode continues to impress me as the first two have.",1400457600,250,2184,4.565552699228792

6408857,1,B00KACCIQM,"This is sometimes beautiful crap. The dialogue is contrived and empty. The conflict is mostly contrived as well. It's full of clich&eacute;s. The popularity of this show is an indictment against humanity and a stain on the history of art. It's full-frontal nudity and gratuitous gore with a third-grade mentality. It's slow. The characters are generally unlikable and universally unbelievable. One of the worse elements is Frankenstein's monster. I don't blame the actor but he's poorly cast. One minute he's reading poetry and whinging about human cruelty and the next he's tearing his way through some poor innocent bastard's thoracic cavity or breaking an old man's neck. The morality is liberal pop. One wonders what sin Dorian Gray could commit in such a world. Eva Green is pretty but she lacks the personality and acting ability to carry this dead horse through three nauseating and stultifying seasons. It's all made sadder by the fact that the material had so much potential, but the writers were at a loss as to how to use it. Instead of creating interesting stories, they sling cheap and contradictory morality around. It's hip, for all I know, but it's not good. I will never be able to look at my fellowmen the same again.

6408875,3,B00KACCIQM,"I grew up on monster movies, which made me think this might be a great idea to reboot the whole thing.  After all, the basic monsters were from the Victorian and Romantic eras, why not unite them all in a series that adds new characters and overarching themes?  Of course, the execution counts as much as the script, and both are lacking in my viewing.

With the exception of the darkly passionate Timothy Dalton, the acting is pretty mediocre.  The others are simply not all that believable, even Eva Green, whom I must admit is not a very good actor in spite of her physical attributes.  But the script also didn't work for me:  the plots seemed schelpt together for their own sake. I actually thought the stories would have been better separately, as the originally appeared before Universal produced its series of comically bad sequels.  Even the long subplot of Eva's childhood and her entanglement with Dalton's daughter didn't work dramatically.

This is more a cult thing than great TV.  I will not get the sequels and do not recommend the series.",1492646400,,1055,4.721311475409836
6408876,3,B00KACCIQM,"Eva Green: A spooky girl in a spooky castle.

The French, as is widely accepted, have a great sense of knowledge about their external issues and national identity or psychology. No people that dramatically engaged in and won such a brutal civil war, would ever be able to ignore what it actually means to be a person born of that particular country; but this also partially accounts for why the actress Eva Green, hits at the ceiling of acting authenticity and yet does not break though it to greater psychological maturity or depth.
Because as is also known, the French, as individuals, have a poor relationship with their inner psychology and this means connection with the unconscious; the seat of all creative power. For an actor this is the key to either good acting or mere performance.
A person who wishes to reveal truth and honesty in their creative pursuits must communicate with and have a knowledge of how to conduct a proper relationship with their unconscious if they are ever to be considered a great artist or even merely genuine artists. an invisible partnership is made and a third ""something"" arrives when a person who enters into a creative endeavour  listens to their unconscious self; and it is for the very brave only. The unconscious and especially the collective unconscious, can speak in a language that is often disturbingly honest and strange enough to make even the strongest person baulk at the obligation.
To see ones true self in the mirror and accept the dark as well as the light of your character, is a very tough prospect. I suspect the French are mostly unable to do this. evidently, they are able and apt at speaking of the external but dodge the personal. this leaves an artist with two main areas of action; approximate art and seem shallow or delve into an inner life and accept ones short comings as well as strengths and show your real self to the world through whatever medium you accept as your avenue of art.
The French can not do this. it is the principal reason why their cinema (and national identity) has a predominately cynical nature and is mostly directed at mocking big themes like government and administrative and authoritative bureaucracies. this they do with significant ability and humorous consequence, but it is at the cost of inner recognition of the individual and therefore authentic contributions to cinematic art Cinema Du Look, for example.
A man receives all of his artistic talents, creative powers and insight from his anima: that is his inner feminine side that all men possess. all women possess a masculine side and that is called the animus, but a woman is not sent her creative ideas from her animus. A woman's creative powers and it should be noted, powers of great promise, already reside deep within her and can only be brought out by direct and honest communication with her unconscious self and the collective unconscious and here is a problem for Eva Green.
Nationally, and I suspect privately, the French Eva Green has more than one psychological stumbling block that prevents her from becoming a good or great actress and time is beginning to tell. From infantile film selection like the unoriginal Tim Burton film to fulfilling a tired cinematic convention as the female shadow prop for James Bond and Vanessa in Penny Dreadful , recent comments from Green concerning her irritation at not wanting to ""be married to a role"" nor no longer wanting to ""play the girlfriend"" or ""box named weird witch"", indicate the animus and unconscious within Green are now emerging and demanding a say. One can never ignore such inner messages because they are what powers the 3D avatar you actually, really are and to disregard such psychological prompts can sometimes mean disaster.
Here, one feels that Eva Green has some inkling that her film selection is juvenile and unfulfilling. Her nations psychological propensity for inner ignorance concerning a private relationship with the unconscious and her own private connection to this, are a roadblock to greater work themes and performances and leave her mostly, I suspect, frustratingly with out any proper roadmap to better work and better acting. what might be Green's obstacle be?
From her dyed black hair to that curious, cross nation, strangled accent that sometimes (for me) mars phrasing, Green is the evident physical embodiment of a persona. As is known, a persona is built around a person for the sole reason to disguise both inner and outer weaknesses and insecurities and especially inferiorities. it is a total performance right down to costume and even career selection and mate selection. all of this in the case of Green, will have been created around her, probably unconsciously, to present to the world the powerful modern day professional that can handle any male company including the worlds best spy. however, an audience is subliminally aware of this psychological mask and feels its distance; but more of this later.
So why was this persona manufactured by Eva Green in the first place? I suspect the real Green has been parked and moved aside to make only brief appearances;  to pave way for and to build this persona for a myriad of very sad reasons. I believe at some point in Green's distant past, either in her childhood or early adolescence, something causing Green significant emotional impact began the inevitable construction of that psychological defence shield and architecture known as the persona. away at once went the blonde hair and in was ushered that strange, hybrid accent that appears to have no real nationality.  something about the younger, blonde/French Green was deemed at the level of her unconscious and animus to be too prone to gather slights or abuses for her to continue with it. Also much can be said about the fact she is a twin and perhaps here she reveals an unconscious wish to distance herself as a conscious entity. I shall keep to myself other issues I believe are also a cause for the creation of this persona. It may even have needed a move away from France and the adoption of her dark costumes disguised as fashion to complete the task, but total obliteration of the real Green and her initial pains and issues will never be made complete.
This persona shouts to those who will listen and to those who will and can be fooled: Do not find me to be a dumb blonde or merely pretty. listen now to my cultivated and approximate posh accent. do not associate me with the class or region I am actually from. pass me by and leave me alone. let me escape from that past. find me to be a dark, curious and clever riddle. But forever stuck, onscreen and off-screen in an illusive and enigmatic ""spooky girl in a spooky castle"" psychological cul-de-sac. And a persona is an exhausting thing; a temporary psychological solution only.
This is why recently the real self of this actress has begun to surface to make statements concerning her issues with character selection and how they leave her unfulfilled, but this is merely a psychological rouse from Green's psyche in lieu of real work into her inner issues thus leading to proper, independent freedom from those issues: and all this tells us much about not only Green herself, but of those around her privately and professionally.
No one, it seems, in any strand of her life, possesses enough psychological intuition or courage to notice and to make mention of this persona to Green and how it might be effecting her life and performances. no one it seems has noticed that the distance created by the persona on screen leaves a clever audience disgruntled by the false approximation of truth of character that is handed to them through the screen. the eyes of a good actor must at all times reflect to an audience the authenticity afforded to it from the soul or psyche; that their unconscious being is met with, is undeniably offered to the audience from the actor and an assumption of truth and therefore quality is accepted; meaning, honest acting. with out inner truth it is superficial performance only.
to merely perform is fine for someone wanting only riches and fame or not possessed of much acting ability, but here one suspects that Green not only wants more for herself than this, but is also capable of it. But time is running out. A little more about those around her. what might be the reason she is apparently with out anyone about her to tell her of these important, intuitive and psychologically motivated inner workings? it could be that an inner protective moat that shields any and all talk of her unconscious world is all part of her persona. in other words, she needs it this way to survive. it could also be that she merely allows only shallow minions around her that do not wish to rock the boat for reasons of their own financial stability; she is obviously a wealthy provider. or more than likely, no one in her sphere of life is psychologically educated and developed enough to able to see what is actually going on in her inner life. That is very sad. they may have vague hunches and inklings, but they are all part in parcel of what is preventing Green from achieving both an authentic characterisation or a definitive screen presence and one of undeniable artistic quality.
Here, we could argue that Green is unfortunately surrounded only by the psychologically immature who do not actually see the real Green, but this is probably how she wants life to be. The real Green will now only show up in her real life and on screen through hard work on those earlier issues. Only when the naturally blonde Green reappears and the clipped, tight accent that seems to talk in strangled diction, is faced and dealt with, can an honest performance of any artistic merit be created. but more of this further on.
In addition to the seemingly superficial indicators of a persona such as the dyed hair, peculiar accent and childish film selection, it is staggering to contemplate that even the career choice of Green herself, could be a further, external psychic sign of her persona at work.
A career in acting out and inhabiting other peoples lives and worlds, enables a fragile psyche that hides behind a persona to further deny the true self at the excuse of the obligation of a career as a professional actress. the chance to live as other people for a good deal of one's life and to inhabit the worlds and words created by others, is often the earmark of a person with little idea about how to be a real integrated person, or as it seems, little interest in doing so.
The tell tale sign of this are the film choices themselves. Frequently she is the dark enigmatic animus or female shadow of a film: dark of hair, dark of costume and just about dark enough of character to be ambiguous and left alone and kept at a psychological distance: much like what is offered off screen by Green herself; eccentric and enigmatic, the inner self never allowed to be explored in any real depth.
From Penny Dreadful, Miss Peregrine, and Morgana in Camelot, and many other dark roles, there are simply too many ""spooky girl in spooky castle"" characters in Green's film choices to suggest mere coincidence. that she just so happens to have the exact look screen producers are seeking ,we now know is also by deep inner design born years in advance of such a career. But even so, her characters often stand on the dot point of the X of the Unus Mundus; the ""one world"" that connects the space between the next world and this one, and though we can see her trying, she just doesnt make it real enough of result to indicate a soul genuinely bridged.
Then one might ask, what is at the heart or the nucleolus of this persona that I suggest was built by Green in order to act as psychological protection? what powers it? what sent it and allowed this dark persona to bubble forth into Green's consciousness to take over the blonde and younger self? it is obvious it is her shadow self at play.
The shadow is the unknown something that inhabits every person's inner world and is made up of mostly negative and unacknowledged small and dark and petty elements of our unconscious world and psyche. the shadow can grip both a person and a nation. for example, Germany was gripped by a mass national shadow during world war two and a person can be gripped enough by a personal shadow to wholly submerge even their true hair colour and actual personality and accent etc.
shadow possession is also a convenient way for a person to dodge the responsibilities of psychological maturity and external consequences. all of this gave way to the birth of the witch or sorceress archetype that Eva Green evidently, physically shows to the world. and now we get to the real centre of the issue with Green's acting. A film fan must wade, subliminally, through an entire psychological stew of barriers and moats created by Green's unconscious, in order to watch her on screen. the effect on a sophisticated audience will be puzzling and irritating. much like a fly buzzing around the periphery that can not be explained or swatted away. for Green, I suspect, along with the well developed and all encompassing persona, the shadow possession and its effect onscreen and off, must be exhausting.
The shadow and how it effects Green's persona and unconscious will make all decisions for her. it will select her fashion, her film choices and even her relationships. it will even decide how she feels about people and thoughts of politics and ideas of the moment. something in her earlier life was not permitted and now it finds expression in her adult life as this persona and shadow at work. I would be curious to know what the dreams of this actress are like; who or what calls out to her as she dreams, I wonder. if Green is unaware of this suggested shadow possession, or can't even admit to the more negative sides of her psyche, then I would suggest her dreams and fantasy life can be quite dark and brutal. all of this of course, disguised by the costume of her persona.
In public life, a persona helps to declare to your public who you feel you ought be. I am the dark sorceress actress. I am more interesting than the blonde youth I once was etc. this might point to the fact that with out this outer performance that makes so many demands on Green's outer life, she herself may feel she is a non entity, as was mentioned earlier. but when a persona is unacknowledged or present most of the time in a persons life, as I suspect it is with Green, then it can create neurotic behaviour. And another brutal psychological consequence being, that by virtue of adopting the archetype of the witch sorceress, is the resulting persona is common and not unique. as evidence, there are more than a few Hollywood actresses who, like Green, have the dyed dark hair and so called gothic clothing both in presentation on and off screen. so if a part of Green's motivation for use of persona was to appear as an original, interesting and unique person, the common number of this archetype denies this; it has not worked.
so what can Green do? Eva Green is now at a curious psychological pathways. she evidently does not have people within her sphere of private or professional life to both recognise she is trapped in a loop nor are able to help her out of the cul-de-sac that might enable her as a person and an actor. But as was noted earlier, with various telling comments in her recent press, her unconscious is beginning to have its say. of course, the French Green will be mostly unaware of what this really means and may attribute it to film character choice fatigue; this might manifest its self in steaming anger that is hidden away from press and people.
she should enter into professional, female friendly, Jungian analysis and, though potentially painful, make real contact with her real unconscious life and find out and deal with the true origins for her persona and forgive those from her past (and herself). she must lose the trappings, costume and performance of that persona. lose the hair dye. be brave enough to speak in her natural voice, both vocally and psychologically. take classes at the actors studio to make contact with genuine emotions that can colour ones acting, in other words authenticity. then and only then will we see the real Eva Green on screen and in life. Mere superficial changes in character selection, genre or image, will never suffice.
A life spent hidden behind a persona can be an unimaginably lonely one. One only has to look at, for example, Marilyn Monroe to see just how lonely they can be and to what possible cost. when a psyche is deprived of not only knowing ones own true self and the distancing alienation of knowing that few in your life or public is interested in the real you, because they don't even know the real you (and hardly does the person at hand) due to your persona, then life can become unbearable. it creates for the actor (and the audiences) the curious performances Green is famous for, but it also builds a life and career all virtually on a fantasy self. Such dark and enigmatic characters and the like are fine when a performer is young, but as one matures in age, the sight of the peculiar and dark sorceress archetype materialises into that of the crone, rather than that of the wise old mother, Green should become.
Finally: If she is psychologically aware of all of this and is even strong enough to begin the task of genuine change, then I shall make two cautious predictions about Green and her career: One. she will win a role and win awards for that role, that sweep away at once all competition. she will be recognized as an actor of great depth and authority and not simply the spooky girl in a spooky castle, that she now inhabits. Two. having dealt with what ever misfortunes and inferiorities created her persona in the first instance, she may well find she no longer needs acting and will instead steer herself to some other pursuit that brings into her life a greater sense of accomplishment (I feel some part of her would already be aware of what this might be). however, and here, I shall sound dark misgivings: Considering the evidently entrenched persona of Green, her people's notorious inability of understanding their own private connection to the unconscious, and the sheer volume of seemingly unaware minions who perhaps occupy her life, coupled with the time and pain all of this will take, it is very unlikely to ever happen. Green will be, for the intuitive observer alone, the living portrait of a very popular, but adrift person trapped inside a false persona, that inhabits her off-screen and onscreen life alike: and this instead, will be the darkest role she will ever play.",1492560000,,18687,4.7190082644628095

6408878,3,B00KACCIQM,"This show is pretty good, but I'll admit, it could have been better. It has a fantastic and talented cast with great chemistry, but something has always felt off about this show. There are some things it excels at (creepy stuff mostly) but I often find myself thinking this show would have been better if it had been produced by Netflix or HBO.
Some moments fall too flat, and other moments are spent focusing on things for too long without a satisfying resolution or any meaning behind it.  Often tv shows will create a character with a purpose and the actor, or actress, they cast is so fantastic they find a way to keep them around longer and really allow a show to evolve with the actors. It's why the walking dead and game of thrones became so popular. Unfortunately, this show didn't fully utilize their best characters (Dr. Frankenstein, Ethan) or spent too long with characters I couldn't give a damn about (I'm looking at you Dorian Grey).
This is one of those shows that should have been a good 15 episodes long in order to really cover everything.  Honestly thid show had a lot of potential to be the next best thing, but instead it became 3 seasons of  The exorcism of Vanessa Ives",1491436800,,1193,4.513888888888889

6408940,5,B00KACCIQM,"Thoroughly enjoyed this three-season series.  I rarely write reviews for films, only if they truly impressed me.  This did.  From the moment each episode began, we were captivated with the creativity of the stories, the beautiful filming, excellent actors/acting, and the music.  So well blended together, the settings & filming were absolutely wonderful.  Even the opening credits were enjoyable & perfectly edited together; such visuals are rarely done so well.

Make no mistake, this is clearly entertainment for mature viewers.  It is graphic:  violence, gore, and sexual situations make this more appropriate for a sophisticated audience.  It all flows together; the excellent characters, and a finely crafted & very interesting plot, evolve so perfectly.  As each episode drew to its conclusion, we couldn't wait to see how the writer was going to weave together such an expanding, complex plot.

Even with a great story, amazing settings, and moving, beautiful music, without the perfect cast it wouldn't come off.  Each actor, starting with Eva Green, Billie Piper, and Timothy Dalton, populate a turn-of-the-century diverse group of people we come to understand & get quite vested in.  People from such disparate backgrounds, being seamlessly blended together, each bringing much needed contributions to the whole.

I could continue on, but see for yourself.  Again, if blood bothers you, if easily scared by things that go ""... bump in the night,"" then you might want to watch the Hallmark channel.  This amazing series will take the viewer on a pulse-pounding rollercoaster ride through the dark o' night.  Buckle-up and prepare for a superior journey!!",1477353600,2,1664,5.338461538461538

6408947,1,B00KACCIQM,"Screamo Frankenstein???  Seriously???  ""Penny Dreadful"" would be more respected if it 1. had decent writers behind it, and 2. used original characters instead of butchering the Dracula story and drastically altering all our beloved monsters..

The acting is amazing.  The production value is high.  Its the writing that makes this flick suffer.  At first glance, it appears we are in for the tale of the Murray family (the parental family of Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."")  It seems like we are about to get a whole new story that will  follow alongside the Dracula timeline, with other monsters thrown in for fun!  Sounds amazing, right?!  Sure.... until you see the 12-something year old girl have a threesome with 2 adults.  That's not edgy, its WRONG.  There's tid bits of promising horror interlaced with ever growing interludes of poetry, monologues, and endless ENDLESS exchanges and awkward, barely legal sex.  You will LITERALLY hear the same lines come out of different characters mouths, as if they all share the same voice.  TONS of Deus ex Machima.  The guy who spends 15 minutes renouncing god performs an on the spot exorcism.  The show has no continuity and does not even stay true to its own world.

It is NOT a clever story that takes place alongside the events of Dracula.  Rather, it is a poor re-imaging of the tale.  Instead of making their own characters, they butcher the ones we love and alter their histories so drastically that it would make no sense for Dracula and the Penny Dreadful story to coexist!  The amazing, brass balls van Helsing has one snippet of air time as a feeble old man who is easily duped.  Frankenstein is a dude in white face paint with black lipstick, and we have to listen to his every internal thought.  Intense scenes of witches struggling against the main character's faith look like nothing more than people straining to push through a bowel movement.  Eva Green is a real life Egyptologist, so of course vampires are supposedly creatures from sunny Egypt land.  ...This crap doesn't fit....

And don't get me STARTED on what they did to Dracula!  They turned him into a powerless panty-waste, and they even screw up explaining who he was in history!!  The talent-less hacks behind Penny Dreadful summed his entire ageless character up as  ""He started a war because he wanted blood.""  NO.

Look, if the writer's are going to steal Stoker's Dracula....  then at least do some research!!!!  HACKS!  Stoker's Dracula was based off the real life Vlad III voivode of Wallachia!  Half the world feared him as a terror, and half the world CELEBRATED him for restoring order and abolishing crime in a completely destabilized Wallachia!  What if you couldn't go to the supermarket without the real threat of being raped or murdered?  You'd probably cheer the dude that put an end to that!  At that time in history, the Ottoman empire had been impaling people into submission (from China to Greece to Armenia) for centuries!!!!  Dracula (Vlad III) and his father (Vlad II) were members of a Christian organization named the Order of the Dragon, whose purpose was to defend their land from the Ottomans.  Modern history tells us the tales of blood drinking came from angry Saxons who were furious that Vlad III Dracula was able to defend his land and restore order, because it took away from the stranglehold they had on the trade routes.  They assassinated his father Vlad II because of this.  It was political.  The historical Dracula was taken from his home as a child in forced tribute to the Ottomans, he learned about Impalement from the Ottomans and turned it back on them when he defended his country - refusing to suffer his people to live in chaos and refusing to pay tribute to the Ottoman overlord Mehmed.  After finally repelling the Ottomans and making Wallachia somewhat prosperous again, Vlad III was betrayed by another nobleman who was vying for the seat of Holy Roman Emporer, and defamed like his father was.

Modern history tells us that he was a desperate man with a limited army trying to defend his country by all means necessary, celebrated much more than feared.  So it bothers me that they take the ""Dracula"" character and screw up not only his fictional aspect but also his history as a real person.

I wish the acting HAD been terrible, because then I wouldn't have been ""tricked"" into watching so much of this garbage.",1476835200,,4405,4.805592543275632

Homeland is SO hit or miss, and I really just don't care much about the rest of their shows -- well maybe Shameless, but probably not enough to keep paying my subscription fees to stream, and Penny Dreadful was the hook for me.

6409048,1,B00KACCIQM,"Someone involved in the creation of this show loves their characters and story so much that they couldn't see them objectively. This affection ruins what would otherwise be a very compelling show by destroying viewers ability to suspend their disbelief. Here are a few examples arranged from gross to subtle:

This review contains spoilers from seasons one and two. You have been warned.

1. Frankensteins original creature is constantly harangued for being ugly, but he is really strikingly good looking. This makes his plight  preposterous, not tragic.
2. At the creation of Brona / Lily, how can Dr. Frankensteins machine of uninsulated knife switches and bare copper contacts function when it is drowned in a deluge of rainwater? This gross oversight makes our dear tragic scientist look incompetent when he should look like a conquering hero.
3. We wait and wait and wait to see the portrait of Dorian Grey. When we finally do, it looks like a cheap, B-Movie zombie pooping on a squat toilet. This image is laughable, not haunting.
4. We wait and wait and wait to see Ethan as a werewolf. When we finally do, he looks like Eddie Munster. This image is ludicrous, not awe-inspiring.
5. While on the subject of Ethan, great pains are taken in this narrative to establish how important he, the Hound (or Wolf) of God, will be in defeating the great evil that plagues Ms. Ives; however, when the time comes, all our glorious Hound does is get locked in a room, kill his best friend, and kill a witch who was already dying. This incongruity renders the entire plot arc ridiculous.
6. Great pains are also taken to establish that Dr. Frankensteins original creature had nowhere to go after he lost his job at the Grand Guignol. The creature moves in with the doctor, who promptly beings an affair with Brona / Lilly. She and Dr. Frankenstein are seen all over the apartment, making love, cooking, dressing, undressing, but where has the creature gone? How can Victor and Lily / Brona be living this way if he is nearby? His unexplained absence ruins this entire plot arc.
7. When Ms. Ives leaves the hovel of her witch mentor, she puts a scorpion sigil on the stone gate. This sigil is apparently effective since, when she returns much later, the house is totally untouched. Yet when she protects Sir Malcoms house with the same sigil, a witch seems free to visit Ethan because she doesnt believe in totems. How does this work? If the scorpion sigil is not effective, why didn't the nightcomers just break into the witchy hovel, steal the Book of Satanic Awesomeness, and destroy Ms. Ives company entirely? This oversight makes Ms. Ives powers, not to mention her very identity as scorpion avatar, seem questionable, not herculean, leaving the viewers confused by her when they should be impressed.
8. Much screen time is devoted to Bronas degenerative lung illness. We are led to believe that she is at deaths door just about the same time Ms. Ives begins to struggle with a major possession. Rather than juxtaposing these two plots, forcing Ethan to make a tough ethical choice, Brona just vanishes from the narrative. Are we to suppose that Brona has conveniently stopped dying just long enough for Ethan to help Ms. Ives? This might be okay if it was just for an evening, but, according to the narrative, Ms. Ives possession took at least a week. The arrival of winter snows during her episode suggests that it may have taken a month or more. This incongruity leaves the viewer wondering about Brona when they should be focused on Ms. Ives, and makes Ethan look careless when he should look compassionate.
9. Dr. Frankensteins second creature, Proteus, was born with almost no pyrotechnic fanfare. Based on the battery of black apparatus surrounding his head, some form of magnetism seems to have been employed in his creation, so he is born in a lovely, eerie silence. Given this fact, how is it possible that Brona / Lily who, the doctor tells us, was made even better than Proteus, is born in a veritable fireworks display of lightning and showering sparks? Comparing the two scenes makes Brona / Lilys creation seem laughably overwrought.

I am putting this these flaws down to love. Love sometimes blinds us to the faults of our beloved, keeping us from seeing them objectively. Someone creating this show loves it so much that they are blind to the flaws of the thing they have made, which, given the presence of a Frankenstein story, is especially ironic.",1469145600,5,4465,4.787289234760052

I found the first two episodes of PENNY DREADFUL to be so gory, bloody and disturbing that I thought I had had enough. Thankfully, I watched another episode and realized ""dreadful"" can sometimes be beautiful. There is a lot to dislike in PENNY DREADFUL. It can be over the top gruesome with its otherworldly demons or are they people lost in a power struggle between good and evil? Then the story turns to a tender if ill-fated love story between two doomed people. But then we are jarred back into the realm of demons and creatures and an unknown world. Creator John Logan must have had a few bad nightmares to create such havoc and mayhem in one series.

A very fine cast is headed by Josh Hartnett, Timothy Dalton and Eva Green. Hartnett shows a talent we haven't seen in the past and Dalton is actually growing more seductive and serene as the years have passed. The former James Bond means business in PENNY DREADFUL as Sir Malcolm Murray searching for his daughter now in the hands of some sort of demon. Eva Green lights up the Victorian era with her style. Unfortunately, her stint as a woman possessed by the devil goes way overboard (through no fault of her own).

Dr. Victor Frankenstein must pay a moral price for his first creation he abandoned and who now seeks revenge. Reeve  Carney gives a heartfelt portray of the handsome and mysterious Dorian Gray (who charms the cast members of both sexes into his bed). Of course, there are a lot of literary references here that might be lost to many viewers. Just why is Gray obsessed with one hidden painting that we never see? I know the story but will most people get the connection?

PENNY DREADFUL is set in violent 1881 England where misery, poverty and violence reigned. A series of macabre crime stories were published and called PENNY DREADFUL. The disheartened public was crazy for the books amidst the fears of Jack the Ripper in their streets.
This series is not for most people. You need a strong stomach to get through this very creative . Some views may find parts to be  disgusting and offensive yet there is a tenderness to some of the scenes and people just try to survive in a terrible time. The series gets sexually explicit at times so be prepared for anything.  Love still shines through at times. But let's be clear, this series can be awfully confusing at times. Just what is happening and who these otherworldly creatures are can be hard to understand at times.

I have a feeling most people will either love this series or absolutely hate PENNY DREADFUL. There won't be much in between. As for me, I am read for Season Two.",1465171200,,2858,4.535922330097088

With Frankenstein, vampires and werewolves involved I thought it would be much more interesting than it was and this show got a lot of rave reviews too.",1463702400,,284,4.480769230769231
6409288,2,B00KACCIQM,"I lied, it's the second most overrated show I've seen. But it still stands.

I watched all the way through the second season and have caught some of the most recent 3rd season currently airing but never saw what all the rave is about. Seeing the title and based on the previews and promotions, I expected a creepy show warranting it's title that homages the pulp horror books of the era and now-classics like Dracula and Frankenstein. I expected a show with an ensemble cast investigating the nigthmares and creatures written to be haunting the narrow streets of London.

The visuals are superb, cinematography and the depictions of Victorian London are excellently moody. The ensemble cast is undoubtedly talented but therein almost lies my biggest issue with the show. It is the epitome of form over function, style over substance.

I love Eva Green but she is by far the worst example of this. I think she's a tremendous actor but so much of that last half of S1 and almost all of S2 is devoted to nothing more than show casing her chops it'ls like they're desperately trying to convince the audience of what a great actor she is. But that's something that wasn't in doubt. Entire episodes are wasted that barely move the plot along and drone on choked full of dramatic monologue inducing moments that seem desperate to shock (her repeated use of profanity, which bothers me not in the least, just seems silly and disjointed). Frankenstein's monster is another example that drags on. The repetitive attempts to ""explore"" his anguish and humanity, always ending with the languishing tears as he falls short would be an interesting side-theme but is never explored more intellectually than as broken hearted blues of the Other and certainly not enough to carry enough screen time as is devoted to short lived tangents which always end in the same crying scene. Josh Hartnett's character I found one of the more exciting, but the show is so obsessed with trying to seem deeper than it is, he get's shafted in terms of character development and loose connections on his background which is only occassionally mentioned (NB: this is currently being explored more in S3).

I fully appreciate insightful, meaningful and symbolic fiction. I studied continental philosophy and love film/literary criticism. I also firmly believe (know) this can be done in a way that is also exciting. But Penny Dreadful has utterly failed to deliver it's promises on exciting action/drama and instead completely devoted itself to the kind of artistic-masturbation that borders on the tedious while the popular pulp horror genre it follows, added with a very large ensemble cast severely limits the authenticity and success at being as profound as it pretends to be.

For the life of me, I have no idea why this show is hyped as much as it is. I watched on waiting to be entertained but instead I was bored. Instead of an intriguing thriller with touches of the philosophical themes like Frankenstein, the horror of Dracula or the mystery of Jack the Ripper I got a hodgepodge of great actors prancing about with no direction trying to constantly put on a montage of dramatic soliliques that seems like a naked grab to hedge as many award winning performances into every single episode as possible without any regard for entertainment. There's a lot of potential here and maybe if they'd used less known actors they could have properly utilized the wealthy premise to it's wonderful possibilities. instead, those possibilities are held hostage to well-known actors trying to show off how great and deep their performances can be.",1463616000,2,3606,4.914614121510673

  But the cinematography is excellent and the portrayal of Victorian London overwhelming at times in that it transports you to that time and place.  Many of the episodes are more of a set-up for the following episode in which ""all hell breaks loose"" in one way or another.

Eva Green has truly exceeded my expectations and as I've already seen the second season I can attest to the fact that her performance only gets better and better. Josh Hartnett is still pretty hot, which also exceeded my expectations.

6409342,3,B00KACCIQM,"I must preface this review with the fact that I did continue onto season 2 (and really like the second season) despite the flaws of the first season.
The first season of Penny Dreadful is intriguing, but I was completely baffled by a show that has violence, possession, etc... and still manages to be boring.  The story, characters and acting is all good, but I couldn't help but feel that it would have been much more entertaining if it had been compressed into maybe three episodes.  Most of the time I felt like nothing was going on, and the plots that were in play I felt like I knew how  they were going to turn out, and the final confrontation felt extremely anti-climatic.  If you are interested in this series I would recommend starting with the second season, which is far more intriguing than the first season.
 What made me continue onto the second season was Eva Green's haunting portrayal of Vanessa Ives, she was the only reason I kept going, and I'm glad that I did.  All of the characters have great potential in this first season, but none of them do anything beyond what the audience already knows from the classic fairy tales.  Dr. Frankenstein makes a monster, Wolfman kills people, Vampires drink blood, Dr. Van Helsing knows stuff.  If you have no knowledge of classic horror you might be more intrigued with the first season, but for those who already know the basics you will probably be board and should just move to the second season where the original content starts to happen.

In conclusion, the first season is really a very very long introduction to each of the characters and the acult world that they fight, or are part of.  For those who know classic horror already, just skip to the second season.  For those who don't you still could probably just skip to the second season.",1463097600,3,1810,4.607476635514018
6409343,5,B00KACCIQM,Best series out there.  Very creative with the use of classic horror figures. Lots of gore and jump out of your seat scenes.  Can't wait to start season 2.

Hartnett shows surprising depth as an actor, and the rest of the cast seems to have thrown caution to the wind and just rolled with the out-there script. This show is absolute perfection for a weekend of binge watching. I'm coupling it with wine, fried chicken, lots of ice cream, and a home pedicure once I start season two.

Didnt expect for this to scare me as much as it did as i've seen many exorcist/horror movies befor.  Other characters are good also except dr. victor frankenstein who is so young as oppose to what im used to seeing him as a middle aged, if not an old man.  I don't like his acting.  Van helsing was really old and very little role given to him and got killed early in this series. Totally different role from the movie long ago with hugh jackman.  This series hav vampires, witches, a wearwolf, the fallen angel (lucifer), and a dorian gray who seems to be inhuman as he heals wounds like wolverine.  They hav not revealed what dorian gray is or wat hes purpose is yet but thats what im waiting to find out.

Fun to watch the initial shock and awe as we recognize what have become stock characters fade into folk we actually care about. Bravo! A steady stream of 19th century horrors and monstrosities - Dorian Gray, Frankenstein, Wolfman, Dracula - uncork, uncoil, and writhe through the story.

6409493,5,B00KACCIQM,"A phenomenal series with incredible actors and dialog along with a fantastic musical score. John Logan (writer/producer of award-winning plays, films and television) has outdone himself with this story of men and women who have as many secrets and flaws as the creatures they interact with.

There is not a bad scene here; every actor excels in each scene and each scene adds layers to the story which takes you back and forth from current to past. The myriad complexities that make up the flaws and strengths of each person as they grapple with who they were and who they must become to fight the evils that surround them and try to consume them, physically and spiritually, is phenomenal to behold.

I can't say enough about the actors that are in this series - everyone plays their part to perfection with special note to Eva Green who excel as the marred and often abhorrent heroine and Rory Kinnear as Frankenstein's monster, who is at once soft and cerebral and terrifying and cruel.

If you like stories that include the realm of mystical - if you liked those stories as a child that included the scary and unbelievable which you knew weren't real but you looked under the bed anyway before you crawled into it - then this series is for you.",1459209600,2,1248,4.638009049773756

I also find it satisfying in a historical sense in that the 19th century was the beginning of presenting these now iconic characterizations.",1458000000,,405,5.296875
6409513,4,B00KACCIQM,"I like this show, it really transports you back to the Victorian age with good costumes and sets. It makes one glad we have antibiotics for the time being. Also, the horror is slow and creeping. Nothing is over the top, the various characters from literature are about the most realistically portrayed I've seen. So that means Frankenstein's monster looks like a sewn together human, not a caricature. This is certainly not Twilight with their pretty boy sparkly skin. But it's also not a jump scare every two minutes either. I like Eva Green and Timothy Dalton, both are quite good in this as are the other players but Dalton in particular comes as a pleasant surprise as I haven't seen him in much beyond his Bond days except for comedy (Chuck and Hot Fuzz).",1458000000,,760,4.637037037037037

6409546,5,B00KACCIQM,"Sucked me in. Of course, I saw previews before season 1 came out and then promptly forgot about it until I was cruising my Amazon Prime Video and found it again. It was worth ordering the Showtime subscription just to watch both season 1 and 2. If you like the Victorian Era mixed with some supernatural elements you'll enjoy this. It isn't corny, which is helpful considering the dark tone it strikes. I can't wait to watch Season 3. I literally power watched both seasons with just a little sleep break on days I wasn't working. Even then, it was hard not to cut back on my sleep just to watch it.",1454630400,2,599,4.357142857142857

6409548,4,B00KACCIQM,dark and intriguing with complex story lines and characters with depth. I also enjoy the way they updated some of the ancient classic characters,1454544000,,144,5.041666666666667
6409549,5,B00KACCIQM,"By far, my favorite show these days.  Eva Green barely needs special effects or CGI to make her body-bending performances super creepy.",1454544000,,135,5.136363636363637
6409550,5,B00KACCIQM,"Enticing, Satiable and Intriguing are the first words that come into my mind after watching the first season of this show. I absolutely love this show. I mean I generally enjoy anything horror with a Victorian setting but this just blew it out of the water. I will start with the story which takes place in 1890's London and delves into a story about a man trying to find his daughter along with numerous other side plots which all are very fascinating. I will move onto the acting which in my opinion is what this show is all about. I mean I have never seen a show that has had so many relatable characters as this show. I honestly couldn't pick a favorite. I mean you have Eva Green, Josh Hartnett, Reeve Carney, Harry Treadaway, Rory Kinnear, Danny Sapani and Timothy Dalton who is a Beast. I couldn't have picked better actors and actresses who evoke so much emotion in the scenes that it creates such a palpable atmosphere. The action is Superbly crafted being as it was created by John Logan who is the writer known for the recent 007 movies as well as Gladiator and The Last Samurai. The executive producer is Sam Mendes who is the director of the past two 007 films as well as Jarhead. The action is on point with very gruesome and in your face fight scenes that are very visceral and extremely chaotic. I will now move onto the cinematography and the location which was shot expertly and they filmed in both London and Ireland which I was happy to see because the aesthetic is certainly there without a doubt. I will close by saying this is a Phenomenal show which I pray continues for many seasons to come and the third season is coming out in May,2016. I plan on watching the second season tomorrow so I will post my review for that as soon as I finish it. Penny Dreadful isn't a show that you want to miss and if you love dark and Victorian London settings with many famous characters then you will certainly be in for an entertaining ride.",1454544000,,1952,4.409972299168975
6409551,5,B00KACCIQM,"Awesome. I loved it so much, I subscribed to ShowTime so I could see the second season!!",1454371200,,88,4.235294117647059
6409552,1,B00KACCIQM,"Too many liberties taken with classic literature.  This has little to do with the actual ""Penny Dreadfuls"" of the Victorian era and doesn't even make reference to the most famous one - Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  Instead it involves characters from Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Grey, Dracula, none of which are Penny Dreadfuls. Bottom line though is that I didn't like any of these characters enough to watch them for hours.",1454284800,6,477,4.8765432098765435
6409553,2,B00KACCIQM,"Yes, dreadful pretty much covers it. This is a monster mash, and not in a good way. Numerous classic literary Gothic characters/monsters have been reduced to cartoon caricatures, and one note stereotypes. A spooky role call including Frakenstein and his monster, Dorian Gray, Dracula and his vampires, werewolves, spiritualists and demonically possessed women.
 Unlike the original creations, not particularly tragic and not frightening. No moral dilemmas, no crises of conscience in this mess. A lot of gratuitous gore and the obligatory sex scenes. More Grand Guignol freak show than suspenseful horror entertainment.
 The acting is fine, the production values are impressive but the teleplays might as well be three day old fish. The writing stinks. Derivative and uninspired.
FYI: A penny dreadful chapbook frequently plagiarized, abridged and reduced a popular work of fiction to it's lowest common sensationalist denominator. The chapbook was then cheaply made and cheaply sold to the British working class reader. Springheel Jack, Varney the Vampire, Wagner the Werewolf and Sweeney Todd were popular penny dreadfuls.
The publishers focused on the blood and guts and excised any literary quality and coherence from their versions, in that sense this penny dreadful series is true to the genre and has been very well named.",1454198400,,1329,5.478048780487805

It was on my to-watch list for some time but I don't pay for Showtime/HBO/Starz and had to wait for it to be available and wanted to make sure it was renewed for another season before starting it (as is my policy). I have to say I was very pleased with this period gothic fantasy drama. Very artistic, very bloody, very macabre. Not for children and not for faint of heart. It has lots of full frontal/back nudity for both male/fem/other and pretty explicit sexual scenes. It deals with vampires, werewolves, young Frankenstein and his ""monsters"", Satan, demonic possession, etc. It has plenty of jump scares and certainly keeps the watcher on their toes and gives you just enough of the story arch each episode to keep you wanting more while still maintaining a good plot and character progression.",1453680000,2,817,4.801418439716312

Poetic and old sayings are used well in the right places. Actors are committed and really pull you in. When you look at it looks like a beautiful painting (lights, colors, camera angles). The music is so wonderful! I can`t believe this was written (composed) `just` for a tv show.  This is true for Season 1 and season 2. Have them both on dvds and keep rewatching them and discover new little things each time.  My favorite tv show!!!

Every single character good and bad was so well casted beautifully acted. The Possesion episode. Holy moly not since the original Exorcist has a demon possesion movie scared the living pants off of me. I love how the series has taken all the late 1800's tales and spun them into one beautiful creation. I've watched each episode over and over again. John Claire (Caliban) is one of my favorite characters. Dorian Grey...is so mysertious and strange. I'm still trying to understand his purpose. Oh and season 2 is as fantastic as season 1. I wonder how they plan on bringing all the characters together....because I will be heart broken if they don't. I hope they tie in elements of Sweeny Todd, Jack the Riper (or was that Ethan Chandlers work), Jekyel and Hyde and maybe even Sleepy Hollow. I'm hooked.",1448236800,2,1069,4.515463917525773

And I was intrigued with the idea of great old legends being given a new slant. I find the actor playing The Creature to be particularly engaging (his mix of rage, pathos and self-indulgent egoism is wonderful). I am a bit impatient with the writers throwing a gratuitous sex scene to the viewers whenever the plot slows down a bit. The encounter between Dorian Gray and the American Werewolf (whose shape changing ability was never in doubt---no surprises there) was confusing and the scene in which the medium has intercourse with a phantom lover was, for me, vulgar. Perhaps they will do a better job with season 2. I'm still not entirely sure if I will be pursuing it but if I do it will be for Frankenstein's ""Creature"" more than anyone else.",1446768000,,924,4.674846625766871

I am obsessed now. I must have watched each season at least 5 times. Eva Green is a marvel, but the rest of the cast is amazing as well. The sets and landscapes are gorgeous -- I have put them on with the sound off while doing other things just so when I take a break and look up, I'll have something lovely to look at. The costumes are unbelievable -- I also sew, and have spent a lot of time freeze-framing shots of several of the outfits. And on top of all of that, the story is killer! The series somehow magically manages to stick to all the tropes that make Gothic great while simultaneously turning them on their heads.

6409668,4,B00KACCIQM,"After a sloppy start, Penny Dreadful hits its stride in midseason thanks to a stand out performance by Eva Green.  Josh Hartnett as the American gunslinger looks out of place in this dark, ghoul-infested London, designed to evoke the Penny Dreadful serials of the 19th century.  With so many beastly murders how else to explain this carnage than an underworld of vampire-like creatures who serve the Devil?  John Logan takes his subject a bit too seriously, but the tone and the acting is first rate.  Logan pays fine attention to his characters, building them slowly with some story lines left dangling for later seasons.  If there is any real fault it is that the demons pretty much remain faceless and we really don't learn what makes them tick, despite Dr. Frankenstein's autopsies.

The first season pretty much focuses on Sir Malcolm Murray and the daughter he lost to the underworld and hopes to regain.  He has solicited the help of an odd company of gentlemen and one woman, who steals the show.  I couldn't take my eyes off Eva Green as Vanessa Ives, particularly during the seance when she becomes possessed with Sir Malcolm's daughter and subsequently the devil himself.  This is pure 19th century Gothic and Eva Green has thrown herself into the role as fully as I have seen anyone do so.  Logan infuses the pulp fiction of the time with passages from Byron, Shelly and Keats, largely quoted by the most original monster since Mary Shelly's creation.  The film is as much about unrequited romance as it is horror, seamlessly woven together.  There is even Dorian Gray.  This is what makes the series so unusual.  It is clearly aimed at viewers who read.  It is very rare you get this on cable television and I am so glad Showtime has chosen to run with the series.  Logan has given himself infinite opportunities here.",1442793600,,1831,4.746835443037975

Their struggle to still fit in to a ""normal"" society while struggling with their afflictions is really written with genius. The writing absolutely draws you in. You can feel empathy towards the characters in the same way that the older movies drew out feelings of compassion while you still struggle with your emotions that these are really monstrous people or creations.

We have Frankenstein's creation displaced in time and space competing for top spot with Dracula who appears to have spirited Mina away from a father she never originally had. He seems to be a kind of Allan Quartermain explorer type obsessed with finding the origin of the Nile and racked with guilt over the loss of both children: his son accompanied him on one ill-fated trip. Buffalo Bill, in the guise of Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) also plays a prominent part together with Dorian Gray convincingly mincing his way through the lot and corrupting any and every one he can literally lay his hands upon.

Th writers apparently couldn't create characters of their own so the went out and latched on to the work now in the public domain of others. Frankenstein, Dorian Gray, etc. Then they concocted these bogus plot lines to play off characters they never created in the first plaf4e.  Then rounded up a bunch of actors willing to give thew audience what they really want--gratuitous sex and nudity and some major gore. Oh there' an assortment of werewolves, monsters...even a flake scene with Dorian spitting on the tranny. How cool is that?

What audiences really want for these series (Game of Thrones, Masters of Sex) is to see actors basically humiliating themselves for the roll and a check.
Speaking of the trans character, the actor (a young Puerto Rican man) who had to introduce his character the first day on the set by dropping his robe so we could get an extended gander at his penis. Is this what good TV has come to? You have to shove a penis at me to tell your story? Apparently these  actors will seemingly do anything for money. Be honest. You take the sex and nudity out of any of these shows and the audience drops by half. The soft core is what they come fr.

6409707,5,B00KACCIQM,"Penny Dreadful is different from much of what has been on TV for a while.  It is set in London during the Victorian era, taking the characters from classic horror novels like Frankenstein, Dracula and Dorian Gray, and combining them into an 8 episode story line that involves the missing daughter of a famous British explorer, Sir Malcom played by Timothy Dalton, and the struggle to locate and save her by Malcom, her childhood best friend Vanessa Ives (played by Eva Green), and a hired gun Mr. Chandler played by Josh Hartnett.

The show packs a lot into the 8 episodes.  It does very well with the shorter season story as many of the cable shows have been going with.  It does wrap up the main story by the end of the season, seemingly anyway, but very much leaves the viewer with a sense of ""what's next"" for the various characters, and leaves the resolution of some of the ancillary story lines open to be explored further in season 2.  I think 8 episodes is the perfect length for the season, which allowed them to focus on one main story, have the other side stories going, but could keep them to the side without making it stale.

For those who gets the discs, the show looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  For extras, there are about 25 minutes worth of extras devoted to the show itself, basically a series of 9 short (between 2 and 4 minute) behind the scenes and making of featurettes.  The only thing that was missing were interviews with the cast and episode commentaries.  Then you get the first two episodes of the series Ray Donovan.  Okay for what is there, but could have had more.  You could definitely tell they were stretching to put material on a third disc.  It could have easily been a 2 disc set.  That said, it is still a great show and worth adding to your collection.",1440892800,,1796,4.439024390243903

And they wasted Scott -Wolf; not even featured series regular in opening credits, after first star status in Party of Five!  Sarah Drew ,too merited opening  credits.  Although often annoying on Grey's, she's talented and added so much to Everwood's third season.  She's so refreshing. Could've done so much more with Scott.  Never saw Everwood on tv.  Bought it for Scott Wolf who deserved more screen time and better storylines.  Love Ephram and young Vivian, appreciated Meryl more and more each season.  What happened to Deborah Mooney and John Beasely this season?  It was the ensemble cast that made this show great.  Less screen time for these highly talented supporting cast, greats, including James Earl Jones made last season a snoozer.  Enough of Bright and Nina already! .",1439510400,,847,5.139705882352941

The cast, costumes, set, make-up, and even the storyline are superior to many other shows of this genre.  Even though most may be familiar with the key characters from assorted tales, the way the writers cobbled the characters interactions together is delightful and will keep you guessing on what will happen next.

The blu-ray video quality is marvelous through out the season 1.  What a treat!

My one disappointment is that there were only 8 episodes and I was mistakenly expecting at least 10 episodes like each of the Game of Thrones seasons.  Oh well.",1438732800,,717,4.788617886178862

6409786,5,B00KACCIQM,"Fun, flawed, mysterious series great for fans of late 19th century England through the lens of supernatural, mystical, gothic horror. Incorporations of characters of 19th gothic literature like Dr. Frankenstein and Dorian Grey, put a strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and is kind of confusing (like when Mary Shelley's brother, the poet Percy Shelley, is quoted by Frankenstein's monster).
The coolest parts of the show are the characters and supernatural elements that're NOT from literature.

6409792,2,B00KACCIQM,"This is what comes from ignoring the basis for a great series, good writing. They spent a lot of effort achieving a look and a mood, but then they don't go anywhere. The first monster scene is illustrative of this. Dalton, Green and Hartnett are in a cellar, dimly lit and then Dalton leads them down a timber lined passage as the music throbs to the steps of the characters, all dramatically lit and filmed. Then, nothing. a dead stop before the action picks up again. Also one notices that there are several awkward cuts between scenes, abrupt and jarring. As for the acting, Dalton and Warner are great, but they have little to say. Eva Green spends most of her time rolling around swearing, and the actress who portrays the Irish whore with TB has an uneven accent that is entirely incomprehensible. The series has a lot of graphic nudity and sexuality that does little to advance the threadbare plot. The omni sexual Dorian Gray bangs everything in sight, including Josh Hartnett, and the Doctor Frankenstein is accompanied by the naked genitals of several corpses. I found myself fast forwarding through some of the lengthy inane speeches, and almost entirely through the two Eva Green episodes of her possession and childhood. Penny Dreadful has the look and promise of gothic horror, but they forgot to hire a writer. Penny Dreadful is dreadfully boring.",1437436800,,1362,4.8247863247863245

6409841,5,B00KACCIQM,"Unflinchingly brave in its endeavors, Penny Dreadful is not for the faint heart, or easily offended.

For those who want something for a mature palette, this 5 star recommendation could not glow more readily. As a self fashioned connoisseur of the darker story telling, this delivers to all counts.

For those that crave the bizarre, and know what talent is, Jake Logan has a truly rare gift for developing full characters with minimal effort, and incredible mystery.

Watched on ShowTime On Demand, was so impressed that I didn't even give second thought to a 20 dollar purchase on Amazon.

6409871,5,B00KACCIQM,"For those of you that like the Horror genre in a grown-up package this is for you. The show being hosted on Showtime provides much more explicit content than is available on regular network TV. Along with the large doses of violence, gore and sex, there is a also a very literate script and great dialogue on display. The acting is outstanding from the whole cast, but this this is a showcase of some very fine work from Eva Green. Some of the past work by Ms. Green has been full on camp (see Camelot and the 300 sequel) and I was worried that the show could also move it that direction too. Not to worry, she provides a wide range of subtlety and emotion in these episodes, to the point that she is undoubtably doing the best work of her career. This show is not for the faint of heart, but is one of, if not the best show currently on tv.",1435622400,,841,4.1656441717791415

Among the group is Mina father Sir Malcolm Reynolds.  Famed explorer and big game hunter from the dark continent of Africa.  It is he who really gathering these man together to combat something that comes from the past of human history.  They also recruit Ethan Chandler an American sharpshooter traveling with a show featuring the wild west of America and harboring a dark past.  Sir Malcolm also enlists the aid of a young doctor by the name of Frankenstein.  Who believes in science and that one day it will over come death itself.  They also meet the young and dashing lord Dorian Grey whose appetite's for anything new and different are never ending.  Each person must come to grips with what they left behind or the demons they must still endure.
  For Sir Malcolm it is the knowledge that both of his children are lost to him.  For Ethan it the fact that while he loves many women he is really hiding from the fact that if he even lets one close enough they may find out his darkest secret that he still harbors to this day.  For Doctor Frankenstein it is the fact that his work has given him great advances and that his first break through has come back to haunt him.  For Dorian Grey  it is the fear that one day the world will no longer hold anything for him.  That is until he comes across Vanessa Ives.
  As they deal with the struggles of themselves they deal in what they have discovered an ancient evil that has laid claim to the living and wants to rule the Earth under the cloak of darkness.

Why three stars? I expect more from my Blu-Rays. I want commentary, exclusive featurettes, mini documentaries, deleted scenes, gag reels, etc. All this Blu-Ray offers is a handful of 1-2 minute clips that are all available on YouTube and two episodes OF ANOTHER SHOW. Showtime, I don't care about your other shows, I care about this one -- enough to have bought it, anyway.

But, whatever, right? It's $20. Penny Dreadful isn't available through any of the common streaming services, and you would pay way more for Showtime. Just a bit bummed that such little effort was put into this product.",1435017600,,865,4.837837837837838

Van Helsing is a guilty pleasure, one that I watch whenever it's on. It's loaded with Victorian/Universal Studios monsters, over the top action, ridiculous situations, and hammy acting. It's terrific.

Penny Dreadful also has a load of Victorian/Universal Studios monsters and characters. But while one is entertaining, the other is a slow slow, even the action scenes are ho-hum.

I tried watching PD last year and fell asleep. Gave another go recently and made it all the way through, and it wasn't too bad, but I got to the end and thought, really, Frankenstein? This was the big reveal? And frankly, by the end, I was so aware I was watching a paste-together, mash-up of a story I couldn't help thinking the writers and director were too pleased with their cuteness.

Acting, good, some dialog is really witty, music competent, lighting sufficiently moody, but not enough to warrant watching another episode. Also: gore and nudity and foul language is what teenagers think is grown-up entertainment. It ain't.",1433894400,4,1024,5.0773809523809526

6409941,3,B00KACCIQM,Mah its ok time killer. Not so much a monster killing show as a sope opra about monster hunters... action scenes are few and far between and for the most part seems to be aimed at emo kids that have watched to much Tim Burton.,1433808000,,226,4.044444444444444

6409943,5,B00KACCIQM,"At last, a horror film series that is better than any cinema movie, and it is for mature grown ups!

We, the audience, are permitted to enter a mysterious supernatural world that is populated with incredibly interesting characters from European folklore. The setting is a stunningly accurate recreation of Tory, London.  The impeccable music soars with emotion.  The sophisticated poetic language over flows with historical, art, and literary allusions and references that I recognize--the result of a classical education. All of the characters give powerful A+, Oscar-quality performances. The unusually strong bold anti-hero female roles are especially intriguing.",1433721600,,666,5.775510204081633

Timothy Dalton, and Josh Hartnett are wonderful, as well. Mr. Dalton's Green-eyes will capture your soul, and Mr. Hartnett is a Wolf you want to love.  Excellent horror with Historical romance idealism. London of this period (early idustrial age) is dark and fore-boading. The cinematography makes you feel the chill in the air, and makes you want to brush the cinders off your clothes!  Liking it very much!",1433116800,,565,5.0978260869565215

6409978,5,B00KACCIQM,"I started watching this series on my Apple TV as most of my other shows had come to an end for the summer.  When I heard that Eva Green (Casino Royale) and Timothy Dalton (Living Daylights, License to Kill) were paired into one show, I thought I'd watch and see just what it was all about.  To my amazement, this show rocks!  Not only do you get all the dark characters of the late 1800s, but mystery and suspense that just makes you want to chew off all your fingernails while watching it.  After the first episode I was hooked.  Next thing I knew, I had completed season one in a marathon watch - 3 episodes per night.

I must say all the actors chosen for their parts surely do them justice. The sets are spectacular and each show simply has you glued to your tv. For real, you don't even want to pause it to go pee!

I'm hoping I don't have to wait an entire year for Season 2 on Apple as I don't subscribe to Showtime. But even if I have to, I'll will surely be worth the wait!",1433030400,,982,4.083333333333333

Only complaint I have are a couple of gratuitous sex scenes.  I don't mind sex scenes that fit within a story, but I don't like when they are injected purely for shock value.

6410007,4,B00KACCIQM,"Well done so far, just finished episode 4, save for the bizarre same sex event at the end of 4, (where the heck did that come from?  So out of context.  Every series now has a mandated same sex situation regardless of historicity, plot etc..., this needs to end).  So, I am a fan of the show, the neo-gothic atmosphere, mixing and contrast between the ancient other and dark with the relatively new light of science and rationality give the show great tension and expresses the zeitgeist of the day.  Further, the smooth weaving of multiple complex stories rooted in 19th century literature is done with great skill.",1432684800,,616,4.675925925925926

6410071,1,B00KACCIQM,"The story begins with Sir Malcolm Murray, well acted by Timothy Dalton, who is searching for his daughter who has been stolen by unknown monsters. He is assisted by several others: his man servant, well played by Danny Sapani, an American sharp shooter
played by Josh Hartnett who is fine in the part, and Dr. Victor Frankenstein -who in this series looks about 14 years old- and seems, as we used to say, too dumb to live. Eva Green plays a friend of his daughter who is trying to assist Sir Malcolm whilst fighting her own battle with the demons who possess her. This poor actress is required to ""chew the scenery"" in virtually every episode and succeeds in becoming terminally boring rather than the beautiful and
mysterious character we met at the beginning of the story.
This tale of Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein's monster might have been combined into an interesting story if
you enjoy the horror genre. But (for me) gratuitous and repeated sex of almost every variety-we haven't yet seen bestiality-, violence, and anti-Christian screeds interrupted the story line rather than enhanced it. What might have been mystery amplified by dread disappeared into the gross-like a insane person fascinated with his own s**t.",1431216000,7,1232,4.985436893203883

I definitely need to keep watching so i can see what direction this show ends up going. The only reason i gave this show 4 stars is that it can sometimes be a little too dark for me. If your not a fan of shows like American Horror Story or Supernatural this is not a show i would recommend. Although if you like strong character development and a cast the you can never completely figure out, the performances by each actor are very well done. Everyone is very damaged in very different ways that you end up rooting for them to find a happy ending.  This show is able to take the overdone vampire story and make it original. Picture a vampire based series set in a time when vampires didn't have a name or classification and are being discovered for the first time.

As an author of horror, I was surprised at how well this series was written and how creatively interwoven the diverse stories are. The sets and costumes are fantastically accurate for the time period as well. But I must admit, it is Eva Green as Miss Vanessa Ives who steals the series. I wasn't familiar with her before this series, but she's an incredible actress. Her appearance ranges from beautiful to bizarre, and she has an incredible range. You might recognize the actress who plays Brona from the BBC series ""Being Human"" as she was the ghost.

Frankenstein's monster is probably the low point of the series, but that storyline promises to get more interesting in season 2. The acting is excellent all around, although Eva Green tops all.

As for Penny Dreadful, as concept, I was willing to see what happens as modern day Victorian literature is brought to the small screen. Spring-heeled Jack and Varney the Vampire would have been more ... interesting.  Not to mention the American (unless this was British made) 1800's UFO (balloons or dirigibles, think  Robur the Conqueror) or the Steam Man of the Plains.

Since this is Britannica's Penny Dreadfuls, I will not mention French or Germanic versions ( or the rest of Europe's Pulp Fiction) or Asia's stuff.  (For the last look up Opium Wars and Railroad coolies.)",1430179200,2,765,4.875968992248062
6410124,5,B00KACCIQM,"Love the storyline, not sure about the graphic sex in some of the stories.  Part of the charm of this type of genre is the workings of one's personal imagination when involved in the story.  If a story/series is well written, and the actors are at their professional best, do we really need soft porn to make it work?  I think not. In fact I believe it would be a better presentation; and your audience could be expanded, because parents might let their 14+ year olds watch this series like we all did years ago.  Filling up on the Bella Lugosi's Dracula, Boris Karloff'sFrankenstein, the Wolfman and Mummy, all of those wonderful movies, made with no naked people having sex all over the place, but absolutely thrilling, chilling and enjoyable.  I like using my imagination.

This is a one of a kind, awesome fantabulous production.

I originally downloaded the first episode because Josh Hartnett was in it, and well, I had a huge crush on him when I was a teenager. Took me not even 20 minutes into the show, and I was hooked.

Not so with Penny Dreadful! It would have been very easy for this to turn into a simple re-hashing of old chestnuts, but the extremely high quality of the writing, acting, sets, and yes--the makeup/costumes makes this series tremendously entertaining. I was familiar with Eva Long from ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut of that movie, her character will make much more sense), but dayum! What she's packed into the first season is not easily forgotten. It's great to find a series where the scripts are fantastic and provide the wonderfully talented cast opportunities to *really* show you what they're made of.

Green for her acting skills and technique, She reminds me of the dramatic actresses from the 1930 & 40's like Betty Davis and the like. Bravo! Ms. Greens acting skills compare to the grand opera singer's  amongst all singing genres.!  I soaked up her performance like the linen cloths that soaked up the blood from the gory scenes. The scenes where the grey haired female vampires fought the heroes got a bit monotonous but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed each epidode with all it's characters, intertwining story lines, wonderful costumes and cinematography. The show  earned an A+ in all it's efforts. Yet I wonder if season two will keep my vivid interest? We will have to wait shortly and see.

6410140,5,B00KACCIQM,"I was looking forward to seeing this and I wasn't disappointed, although... I could've done with less of the antics of the medium.  Five minutes of her posturing, snorting, spouting vulgarities in a squeaky voice and rolling around on the floor or crawling on tabletops was enough but to carry it throughout the series to such lengths was boring. I read a book while her performance was going on, impatiently thinking, ""Hurry up, let's get on to Dorian Gray, Dr. Frankenstein and something interesting."" They might've made her a little more attractive, too, since she seemed to draw men to her. I really couldn't see the allure. It must've been something very subtle. Indeed the other characters, though re-written for this series' sake, are much more interesting and I looked forward to their performances impatiently.

This is a well-written series which doesn't pull any punches where the times, vagaries, and vices of that era are concerned.  Well-acted, well-written, the scenery and backgrounds are like paintings from that era, and the storyline leaves not much to the imagination, in spite of its revamping of the stories most of those who like this genre are so familiar with.  There's plenty of drama, horror, and angst, as well as a generous dollop of nudity and sex, and it left me looking forward to Season 2 with no qualms except I hope the medium has fewer ""possessions"" in the coming months....and if they actually get back to Africa as Sir Malcolm plans, dare I hope the Mummy will be making an appearance, also?",1429833600,3,1529,4.891891891891892

I have the feeling that these characters have gone from the pages of books, to begin to live by their own laws.

Instead, I think it is both fair and wholly honest to describe Penny Dreadful as some of the most inventive fun I've had with a series of any kind. Watching the first season of Penny Dreadful feels like I'm seeing House of Cards for the first time, or BBC's Sherlock. There is little on par with this combined level of cleverness, originality, and knuckle-busting pacing. Penny Dreadful has been an intensely savory meal, and I can't help but hunger for the next season.",1428105600,2,578,4.514285714285714

  Later at a Wild West Show, Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett), is putting on a one-man ""Buffalo Bill"" show for the audience at this carnival in London. Vanessa is watching. Ethan is a sharp-shooter. Later, Vanessa requests Ethan for his services for some night work. He is asked to show up at this address 11:00pm. He does and Vanessa takes him to a dreadful place with sick people.

6410202,5,B00KACCIQM,"How could you not like Josh Hartnett in any kind of movie?

Tortured souls looking for redemption, each and every one of them.

 I enjoyed the suspense, though a little predictable.

Reeves Carney does an admirable job at Dorian Gray, making this little known or acted character quite interesting.  Eva Green's character is well done.  Appropriately dark and brooding.  Harry Treadaway plays a wonderfully addicted Frankenstein. Timothy Dalton always plays his characters to the T.  Maybe it is his superb natural English accent (thought he is from Wales), or that glint in his eye, but I always love his characters.

And Josh Hartnett, what could I say.  That bowler hat looks smashing on his head.  Actually I can't say very much more without ruining his very well done character.

Just buy it and enjoy.",1427241600,2,806,4.932835820895522

6410221,5,B00KACCIQM,This is a very adult series and at times very erotic. The action scenes can be very violent and bloody. The characters are exciting and the acting is very good. The story line seems a little weak and I have yet to develop a strong attachment to any of the characters.

6410223,1,B00KACCIQM,"I really wanted to like this show. I stuck through to nearly the last episode before I finally called it quits.

Remove the perverted sex, vulgar language and bloody images and you have actors stumbling (usually naked) through a weak story with a muddled plot and confusing array of clues for what is to come.

Penny Dreadful moves at a snail's pace. Without the sex, cussing and bloody imagery, there is only about an hour's worth of story in 8 episodes.

Sadly, we aren't much further at the end of the show than the beginning.

Eva Green steals the show with her amazing ability to move seamlessly from buttoned-up semi-prude to devil-possessed witch.

But her character never really moves forward. She just continues to battle the demons in an endless stream of sex and possessions and prayer.

I will give the show props for atmosphere, costumes and sets, but even these can't help a show lacking plot.",1425945600,19,907,4.745222929936306

What killed this show for me was the terrible and predictable writing.  I don't want to ruin anything with spoilers but every plot twist was painfully predictable and much appears included only for shock value.  I will not watch the second season because this one was just so poorly written.,1425859200,13,464,4.609756097560975

Combine that with outstanding actors alongside the brilliant writing and you've got one hell of a show.

6410254,5,B00KACCIQM,"If you had told me the premise of ""Penny Dreadful"" before I'd seen it, I would have probably rolled my eyes. A collection of famous characters from 19th century Gothic horror novels thrown together into an original plot? Yeah that worked SO well for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/League-Of-Extraordinary-Gentlemen/dp/B000JJLTA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B001JIAK66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>&nbsp;movies. (Not).

So the fact that ""Penny Dreadful"" manages to be compelling, thought-provoking, and genuinely interested in engaging the themes of the books that inspired it is a miracle in itself. One of its particular strengths is in throwing the viewer into a strange situation without much context as to what's going on or why. As each episode unfolds we get more clues as to who these characters are and what they're trying to achieve, but the show is content to take its time in divulging answers, and is exceptionally good at the ""show don't tell"" rule. If you want to understand what's happening, you have to pay close attention.

""Penny Dreadful"" focuses mainly on the odd dynamic that exists between the mysterious Vanessa Ives and her guardian Sir Malcolm Murray. It's kinda-sorta-mostly a paternal vibe (in a very dark and dysfunctional way) but at the same time you can feel more-than-a-little hint of sexual chemistry between them. For the first few episodes at least, you'll be watching their interactions carefully, trying to figure out what their history together might be.

It soon becomes clear that the pair are looking for someone, and in this search they employ the services of American gunslinger Ethan Chandler and dedicated surgeon Victor Frankenstein. As the show goes on, other familiar names and faces pop up: Dorian Gray, Abraham van Helsing, Mina Murray, and of course, Frankenstein's Monster (here called Caliban).

As well as this, the show seems determined to throw in every single Gothic trope that was ever known to the genre. Sances, opium dens, vampires, Jack the Ripper, consumption, resurrectionists, heavy mist, candlelight, demonic possession, spiritualism, big game hunters, darkest Africa, madhouses, Egyptology, exorcisms - you name it, it's here. Needless to say, if you're a fan of Gothic horror, then this show is the Holy Grail.

Vanessa Ives is a role that's finally worthy of Eva Green's beauty, intensity and fearlessness as an actress. Her body contortions, facial expressions, measured tones, magnificent side-eying - she's absolutely riveting, and I swear, she DOESN'T BLINK. Whenever she's in conversation with somebody, Green never closes her eyes.

Timothy Dalton is a shoe-in for Sir Malcolm Murray, a paragon of Victorian masculinity; whilst Henry Treadwell is Victor Frankenstein, whose youth helps exemplify the contrast that exists between the passionate, thoughtful poet and the cold and ruthless doctor. Rory Kinnear as Frankenstein's Creature manages to emote through makeup that makes him the most accurate rendering of Shelley's descriptions I've ever seen. No green skin or neck bolts here!

Billie Piper puts on a good show as Brona Croft, a young woman dying of consumption who struggles to live out her remaining days with as much dignity as possible - even in the face of her sordid surroundings. And who would have thought Josh Harnett had this in him? As American gunslinger Ethan Croft, he's portrayed as deeply sensitive and gentle despite his brash exterior. Watch him closely though - it's clear he has a secret, and when the show is finally ready to reveal what it is, you might well be cheering in your seat.

Only Reeve Carney's Dorian Gray feels a little extraneous, his background left unexplained and his storyline unconnected to the central narrative. Likewise, Danny Sapani's Sembene, Malcolm's trusted right-hand man, is embarrassingly underused. Ah well, there's always next season.

The show also boasts an incredibly talented supporting cast: David Warner, Alun Armstrong, Helen McCrory and Anna Chancellor pop up for small but memorable roles.

It's definitely not for everyone. It's dark and disturbing and gory - and quite terrifying at times! It also assumes some familiarity with the source material (pretty much everything to do with Dorian Gray will be incomprehensible to anyone unaware of his story) for plenty of the twists and subversions depend on knowing *what* exactly is being subverted.

It's amazing how much gets packed into eight episodes, and how well the writers pull off the fusion of literary characters into a single narrative. Every second of ""Penny Dreadful"" counts, even as the luxurious pacing allows the actors to actually *work* at conveying information, emotions and relationships through their eyes and body language.

I've already watched the first season three times already - and it holds up beautifully with each re-watch, yielding more clues and insight into the storyline every time. The music and sound is also wonderful, filled with whispers and echoes and meaningful little cues, and the costumes, set dressing and make-up are stunning.

I really can't rave enough about it. If you love Gothic Horror, then ""Penny Dreadful"" is tailor made for you.",1424476800,,5373,5.537804878048781

I was hoping for something in the vein of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or Steampunk or even a new original show with all the classic monsters in it. Man was I wrong! The show focuses on a woman that isn't even in the classics and some lame power she has that makes no sense. There is an entire episode dedicated to her being tied to a bed and screaming. Really? The only good character is Dorian Gray. His dialogue is amazing, but you see him so little that it's few and far between. I would skip this one if you are looking for a great show.

I so dislike writing bad reviews because I know how much effort goes into any given production.  I gave it a three star because I know alot of people like blood, guts, and gore and creepiness of every sort.  I don't, but will tolerate it if it tells a good story and moves along.

6410281,3,B00KACCIQM,"There are many factors as to why I wanted to see this show. Cast writer/producers, setting, and the concept. Then I heard the music and it instantly hooks you into the mood and atmosphere of the proceedings. It IS another cast member. All of these things are fantastic taken separately, however, as a coherent whole it fails.

I love that some of my favorite Victorian monsters are all re-imagined and all populating the same time and space concurrently. This can lead to an explosion of great story ideas. The show is violently graphic, as it should be. These are after all (fictional) monsters. But monsters non-the-less.
The general populace lived in fear and it shows. Poverty was rampant, murderous scum did their deeds in the guise of nightfall and the aristocracy did their evil deeds in plain sight, but with nicer clothes and nicer homes.

All in all, you can see where every single penny goes in this show. So, why not five stars?

My issue with the show lies in its general/ main story.
For me it was not well told and even an interesting character as Ms. Saint Ives I don't think deserves as many episodes as she got. There are only eight precious episodes and she was showcased (by my count) in at least 3. This leaves 5 shows to tell a main story.

Also the main story was for lack of a better word, dull. Which is embarrassing to say when you take into consideration that these characters are. I feel that the characters where well beyond the task given, but the writer purposefully prolonged the inevitable for the sake of fulfilling show requirements.

So you see, I wanted to spend all my time with these characters, just not doing what they were doing.

Also, some characters did nothing to improve, enhanced, move along, or accentuate the story in any way. Dorian Grey, Sembene? You could remove them from the show (as is) and literally nothing changes.

There is partial nudity and R rated sex. Some scenes of homosexuality (if you need to keep track of these things)
Please bear in mind that these are deplorable characters, monsters and villains. We are seeing the world through their eyes. These are NOT heroes or the ""good guys"", they are meant to do vile acts. Keep your expectations within reason.

I hope next season weaves a great story for these fantastic characters and treats them with the respect they deserve.",1423612800,,2343,4.669902912621359

6410288,5,B00KACCIQM,"Universal Pictures, towards the end of its cycle of horror movies in the 1940s, began having monster mashes, films where Frankenstein and the Wolf Man and Dracula butted heads with each other.  John Logan, the creator of Penny Dreadful, is doing much the same thing here.  However, he is not using the film versions of the monsters for inspiration.  Rather, following Alan Moore's example, he is going back to their literary roots.  He specifically said, in one of his many YouTube videos, that he was combining the story lines of Frankenstein, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Dracula.  Although he didn't mention it in any video I saw (and, darn, who has the time to listen to them all?), he also added a prostitute dying of tuberculosis who might remind one of a certain Les Misrables character.  He has an African explorer as a lead character, but he cites the real and great Victorian explorers as his inspirations, not H. Rider Haggard and his Allan Quatermain.  He probably won't admit to borrowing from the non-Victorian and non-classy William Peter Blatty.

This is the team of five heroes banded together to rescue Mina Harker nee Murray from a vampire master.

1. Sir Malcolm Murray, the African explorer.
2. Vanessa Ives, who like the woman from Acts with an unclean spirit has psychic abilities because of her resident demon
3. Ethan Chandler, an American sharpshooter, hired gun, werewolf (the latter trait not much emphasized)
4. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, a young physician in need of money to finance his researches
5. Sembene, an African who works as Sir Malcolm's servant but is obviously something more

There are others out of the team but connected to the members:

1. Dorian Gray, a young man enamored of Miss Ives but quite happy to seduce anyone who is available
2. Frankenstein's monster, who, to my joy, is very much Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, angry over his creator's desertion, insistent on having a bride made, well educated in the great English poets (as is Miss Ives' devil)
3. Brona Croft, an Irish prostitute dying of tuberculosis whom Chandler loves and whom Frankenstein has designs on

If you want to know where Dracula is, know that the vampire master is not a courtly European count but a Nosferatu who speaks only in growls and hisses.  Very disappointing, that.

Logan has largely succeeded with his classy mix of Masterpiece Theatre sets and costumes, gothic story lines, and aberrant sex and violence.  I'm tempted to go through the actors who play the characters and tell you how good they are but there are too many of them.  I will give special notice to Eva Green as Vanessa Ives.  She had to disrupt a sance in one episode by displaying a small legion of dead and angry spirits.  In another, she had to lose her mind and be subjected to the very best Victorian treatment for mental illness, said treatment based on hydrotherapy and what looked like small-scale trepanning.  In the penultimate episode, she went through a possession so believable that I feared to watch.",1422748800,,3016,4.844054580896686

They decided to push the sexuality over the brink instead of relying upon good, solid storytelling with interesting characters.

Dalton is exemplary in his role and is one of the better parts of the show.  Hartnett also excels although the writing of certain scenes with him was not his fault but the directors/writers downfall.

 Luckily, season two has been confirmed, so having already tasted something similar to the League of (very), Interesting Gentlemen - and ladies - we are set up and waiting for Wolfy to appear more regularly, an invisible person to pop up (or not), Captain Nemo to astound us with his steampunkery (or perhaps his daughter...?), plus Mr. Hyde, a swarm of Herbert George W's lunar bugs (on a return visit, care of some recycled Cavorite), a mummy or two and perhaps something more reptillian too...?

6410373,2,B00KACCIQM,"As others have said, this show has good production values and good actors. The basic idea has potential. However, most of the show's characters and plots develop through stereotypes that restrict the show from actually exploring anything meaningfully weird. Borrowing interesting characters from literature is a failed crutch. For instance, instead of attempting to explore concepts of surfaces and corruption through Dorian Gray, the show's writers make him into an orgy-bored pretty boy spouting banal truisms that would have earned the scorn of Oscar Wilde. Brona Croft, played very well by Billie Piper, is the most interesting character, but is stunted by having to play the love interest of the poorly written Ethan Chandler.",1419897600,,731,5.421052631578948

Perhaps the intermingling storylines will now begin to fold open and explain more. That being said everything else about the show is great. The atmosphere sets such a dark tone, dreary and repressive. Definitely a show to watch at night, the costumes add to the ambiance by looking sad and worn.
Each character reveals a little bit more every week, so you begin to wonder how they must all connect. The actors are such a diverse group that it is kind of fascinating to just watch a scene and see how the words bounce around and where they land.

The only reason I even watched it when it played on Showtime (and I DVR'd it and didn't watch it until a couple of months after it ended-dumb me) was that I LOVE Eva Green.  She's one of my very favorite actresses.  I also like Josh Hartnett, so I figured that, at the worst, I would enjoy watching the two of them apply their talents to Victorian roles.  I was hooked on the first episode and binge watched the entire series.  Then, I watched it again.  I have a friend who works for Showtime and  I sent her an email telling her how much I had liked the show and she replied in telling me that a second season was underway.  I was overjoyed and cannot wait!  As soon as this season 1 came out on DVD, I bought it.  I could not even wait for the price to come down.

6410403,5,B00KACCIQM,"It seems like every content producer is trying to capitalize on the current craze for monsters and demons. So much of it (in my opinion) is like adding a monster ""skin"" over-top the same tired stories and played-out modern dramatic woes. Penny Dreadful is a bit different. Yes, it's using the old monster archetypes to weave a narrative, but the characters who inhibit the roles (monster and not-monsters) feel much more fully-realized and truly seem to have an edge, darkness and personal affliction (if you will) that drive the stories and interactions on a deeper level.

A superb cast, including character actors you've seen a million times but couldn't name; a complex storyline that fascinates and works, weaving fiction and literary fiction in a very original way; metaphyics, poetry, music, spiritualism, gore, and hocus pocus with intelligence; and eliciting great warmth and sadness from the characters and story.  If you enjoy the era of Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, Dickens, and Conrad, this is for you.  Every once and a while cable is this good.  PD will entain, make you think, and get you to feel--the big three.  Highly recommended and you can watch it more than once.",1418860800,,748,5.081967213114754

6410415,1,B00KACCIQM,"I was looking forward to this since they said their story lines would involve vampires, Dorian Gray, Frankenstein etc. but so far I am really disappointed (& I've only watched 2 episodes so far). For starters, too many creepy crawly bugs; too much graphic (disgusting) violence; graphic (vulgar) language: & graphic nudity. I'm not a prude, I just find it all unnecessary & detracts from the storyline. If you have a good story, you don't need all the graphic garbage. (It's no wonder kids today don't know the difference between acceptable & unacceptable behavior when this is always what they see in the media.)  So far I find the story lines rather weak - & the director must have agreed, which is probably why they put in all of the graphic garbage to try & keep people interested. It has the opposite effect on me. Sure, they're dealing with vampires, Dorian Gray, & Frankenstein in the first 2 episodes, but it's weak. I'll try & muddle through the rest of the episodes (I think there are 10 on this DVD) but I doubt I'll make it to the end.  It should be called TRULY DREADFUL.  (I honestly do NOT understand how anyone can rate this garbage 5 stars. I'm surprised David Warner & Timothy Dalton would even be in anything this bad. *update - I can't even get through the 4th episode. What a waste of money!)

6410452,3,B00KACCIQM,"If you weren't aware penny dreadfuls were cheaply made British weekly magazines made at the turn of the century that depicted lurid tales of adventure and sensationalized fiction that sold for a penny, thus the name. The stories were more in tune with the readers of the time as low cost examples of fiction they could enjoy but never care too much about. The same could be said of this series.

I truly wanted to love this series. It had such a great look to it right from the start. Timothy Dalton is Sir Malcolm Murray, an aristocratic adventurer in Victorian London who is searching for someone we later learn is his daughter. Helping him in this task is Vanessa Ives (Eva Green), a woman in tune with the supernatural, a good thing since the evil beings that have absconded with his daughter are almost all supernatural in one form or another. As the show opens the two of them recruit an American gunslinger named Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) from a Wild West show to be the muscle and weapon expert they need in certain circumstances.

As the series progresses were introduced to a number of characters taken straight from the pages of gothic horror novels that took place during this time period. Its difficult to explain the series any further without revealing who these characters are but Ill do my best to work around that problem. One is a doctor whose past comes to haunt him as the show moves forward. Another is a man whose debauchery seems to know no bounds. And the evil that haunts the world of Sir Murray is an evil that has seen his portrayal on screen done for decades now. Their stories intertwine with that of the search for Murrays daughter as well as events that take place in the lives of the three main characters.

Dalton does well with his role here, offering the once mighty warrior in his prime now older and wiser, using every means at his command to rescue the one thing that means the most to him. Green plays the mysterious woman well but as with anything involving her eventually resorts to removing her clothing. Im beginning to think she insists on this in her contracts. Hartnett is perhaps the weakest of the three doing little more than shooting his six guns now and then and bedding down a local prostitute he falls in love with.

Im sure Im in the minority here but this series does what nearly every pay channel series does these days. It feels the need to push front and center nudity and sex scenes that involve nearly everything imaginable. Its as if they feel the need to insert this to make sure that people know they cant get this on regular TV. For me this gets boring. I will commend this program though for not diving in only seconds from the main credits but waiting at least a few minutes before we get a glimpse of Hartnetts posterior as he slams into a young fan up against a wagon in broad daylight. Ive always felt that if your story was solid enough you don't have to resort to this repetitively. Apparently the makers of this show don't think they can hold you week after week without tossing it in.

While being a show that takes place in a time when horror fiction was at its peak and involving some of the greatest creations of that time, it rarely if ever feels terrifying or even surprising. A few good special effects sequences are well done and when the story is actually there involving the battle between good and evil it is to be commended. If those in charge would get rid of the time wasting material and stick with the story perhaps this could be a great show. As it stands it is only a decent one. I wouldnt say it isn't worth watching because of the good parts but know going in what you have to sit through to get to those moments. If Victorian filled horror is your cup of tea then this is for youas long as your morals aren't along the Victorian era type.",1417564800,29,3837,4.4446022727272725

I love period shows that totally submerge you in an era - and Penny Dreadful does not skimp when it comes to submerging. The clothes, the backdrop, the language - heck, the streets even look smokey like they did when Jack the Ripper walked them from the gaslights that were used to light the streets (I think that's the reason). But the superb cast is what really makes this series. Eva Green is show stopping as Vanessa Ives and Reeve Carney as Dorian Gray is a real standout. The entire cast makes this 8 episode season enthralling from beginning to end. Season 2 is already in the works and from what I've heard, it's 2 episodes longer than the first, so if you haven't seen Season 1, hurry and watch it so you'll be ready when Season 2 begins, you won't be sorry, it's well worth your time.",1417392000,4,858,4.36875

I felt that they were a good slow building story line that built upon the characters and yes it did have a slow pace that just made certain scenes that much better.  The acting alone deserves 5 stars.  Billy Piper who played Rose on Doctor Who, was phenomenal.  In Doctor Who I thought she was a bit dull and had no charisma.  She practically ate up the scenery whenever she was there.  The character Vanessa Ives was so riveting that during several of her performances she made me gasp.  Josh Hartnett who I had basically written off as an actor after some of his last few movies, his understated performance brought much heart to the series.  I was amazed by the depth and breath these actors brought to their individual characters.  The only disappointment I had was the ending.  It really should have been 10-12 episodes instead of 8.",1416787200,,927,4.530120481927711

6410510,5,B00KACCIQM,"The famous African explorer Sir Malcolm is looking for his daughter Mina with the help of possessed Catholic nymphomaniac seeress Vanessa.  It seems that Mina has fallen in with the wrong sort - the sort that are called ""hemophages,"" according to Dr. Van Helsing, who has an appearance in only two stories before his story arc is terminated with extreme prejudice by product of an all-too successful experiment by Dr. Victor Frankenstein in transcending the borders of life.  In dealing with the nests of hemophages, Sir Malcolm enlists the assistance of American fast-draw Ethan, who takes up with a women dying of tuberculosis, who happens to have a relationship with Dorian Gray, who lurks around Vanessa.

In short, we get introduced to almost every horror trope making its way around late-nineteenth century Britain, except, maybe, the Invisible Man and the Wolfman.

The production values are good. The setting is the gritty side of late Victorian England. The story moves along at a nice clip.  Some scenes are gory and there is gratuitous sex scenes  and nudity that will pop up just when your small children enter the room, so be alert.

6410516,5,B00KACCIQM,"""Penny Dreadful"" isn't for everyone, let me get that out of the way right at the beginning, but if you are a fan of late Victorian horror then this series is right down your alley. It takes its name from the cheap novellas that were such a delicious guilty pleasure for English gentlemen and ladies who had a taste for what might be called the more exotic forms of literature than were available from reputable publishers of the day. Those penny dreadfuls were full of evil villains, a few vampires, buxom maidens in desperate need of rescuing and what in those days would have been considered ""unspeakable desires.""
This series carries on that tradition in excellent form. It has a wonderful ensemble cast headed by Timothy Dalton, Eva Green, Billlie Piper and Josh Hartnett. Its characters include not only Dr. Frankenstein - who works in London - and Dorian Gray, he of the ageless appearance, but also not one but two of Frankenstein's creations.
There is a fair amount of blood spilled during the series and both Ms. Piper and Ms. Green sometimes appear without a stitch... as I said, it's not for everyone so if you're offended by bloody scenes or naked bodies you'll likely want to give this a pass.
But if you are not troubled by those things and you do like a really good horror show, then by all means check out ""Penny Dreadful."" It's a wonderful series with some really interesting plot twists and some very fine actors doing what they do best, entertaining us.",1415145600,9,1472,4.665384615384616

6410526,4,B00KACCIQM,"Writer-creator-producer John Logan has taken some of the great horror and gothic novels, combined characters from each into a riveting and original series. ""Penny Dreadful"" (it's title taken from the nickname for lurid pulp fiction that would be serialized and sold at the time)takes elements of Dracula, Frankenstein, Dorian Grey and other popular horror legends combining them in a memorable new story. Characters from those novels appear (sometimes meeting an unexpected demise as Logan wanted to make the point that the series was not going to be faithful to the novels and stories he pulled the situations and characters from) in new and sometimes unexpected  ways.

Sir Malocolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) a well known explorer of Africa, his servant Sembene (Danny Sapani)and Vanessa Ives (Eva Green)search London for Murray's daugher Mina who has been kidnapped by a vampire and held hostage. Murray hires Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway)to help understand the creature that has his daughter and Ethan Chandler an American marksman to help defend them as they track the creature.

""Penny Dreadful"" has been renewed for a second season but writer-producer Logan manages to tie up most of the loose ends of season one leaving just enough strands undone for a strong second season.

Featuring a host of terrific supporting actors (David Warner, Billie Piper, Rory Kinnear, Reeve Carney), lives up to its name mixing a diverse pedigree of characters in a visually arresting tale.

Be aware if you are offended by nudity or sexual situations, there's plenty of both in the series.

The image quality for this dark series is exceptionally good. The cool color scheme is accurate to how the show was broadcast and is even more memorable in its blu-ray presentation. Blacks are solid and crisp thorughout with detail and depth only hinted at in the HD broadcast on Showtime. There's quite a bit of detail that was also only hinted at in the broadcast version.

The 5.1 lossless audio provides a terrific bedrock to build the ambient sounds of period London but dialog is clear throughout. We also get a Spanish 2.0 mix that's quite nice sounding. Subtitles are available for English.

The blu-ray Paramount/CBS release improves on their previous offerings which often were had few special features for their important Showtime shows such as ""Dexter"". This set features no commentary tracks which is disappointing given the complex plotting and carefully cultivated look of the show.

We get 10 production blogs (also available at the Penny Dreadful website) which run around two to three minutes each. While there are quite good (albeit brief)look behind the curtain, it would be nice to see a production documentary and commentary tracks. One can wish I suppose that Paramount/CBS will one day understand that fans of shows like this that will buy it want that sort of thing.

As with many other series that Paramount/CBS releases on home video, the studio has included two episodes from another terrific series that they are trying to promote ""Ray Donovan"". Luckily, you don't have to access these (as with some of the extras for ""Dexter"") from BD-Live or the web.

While I would have liked Paramount/CBS to include more special features (and include commentary tracks), this is a solid set if you can get it for a good price. The series itself is terrific and well worth investing in.

6410528,5,B00KACCIQM,"If there is a television series I have been more impacted by than A&E's ""Penny Dreadful,"" I would have to travel all the way back to ""Deadwood."" If you love gothic romance, Victorian England, the iconic creatures and legends of the penny dreadfuls themselves, inspired, vibrant writing, directing, production; this is a must visit world. After the pilot episode, I was expecting quality campyness from what followed, what I found instead is authentic moments of brilliance, grounded in consistent, ever richer excellence. Eva Green's riveting performance leads the feature film cast, into depths of character and breadth of storytelling rarely attempted, let alone perfectly realized in any medium. The first season erupts with kinetic energy, paces with adult measure and sophistication, yet builds towards a climax of startling satisfaction and surprise.

Here is a unique take on Frankenstein, both creator and creation, capable of moving you to tears and haunting your heart, a Van Helsing to captivate you, undead creatures shudderingly unnerving and free of cliche, a Dorian Grey worthy of his painting in the closet, all orbiting Timothy Dalton's grounded, agonizing performance as Sir Malcolm Murray, an aging explorer, searching for his kidnapped daughter, Mina. The character is clearly a career pinnacle for this actor, whom I had clearly underestimated.

A complex and delicious mash up of the very cream of the Gothic Thriller genre, with cast and creative team clearly striving to create enduring work, not simply the riddle of the week, ""Penny Dreadful"" will reward those drawn to the dark side, with a well of soul who's bottom cannot be glimpsed with even a piercing gaze.

We watched and recorded the series when it was on DirecTv and even though it was in High-Def, it was not even close to this quality. The cinematography is very artful.

Watching as the cinematographer moves his focus point across a semi-profile, stops for a moment and then continues on is a joy.

6410540,4,B00KACCIQM,"""Penny Dreadful: Season One""
(Showtime, 2014)
. . . . .

A Gothic horror mash-up, ""Penny Dreadful"" concatenates characters and motifs from numerous 19th Century popular genre fiction stories -- Frankenstein, Dracula, Dorian Gray and others cross paths amid a densely thicketed, horror-filled plotline in 1890's London, a darkened metropolis populated with monsters both human and supernatural. Slashers, seers, vampires, werewolves, mummies, mystics, prostitutes, adventurers and philosophers abound in the show's gritty, grotesque demimonde.

It should be mentioned that the show owes a large but unrecognized debt to Alan Moore's graphic novel series, ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" which also gathered together iconic characters from vintage pulp fiction and combined their talents in new, sinister stories.  But where Moore punctuated his adventures with a hefty dose of humor, Showtime's ""Penny Dreadful"" is deadly serious. The show is packed full of highly gratuitous sex, violence, profanity and gore, yet another step in the transgressive one-upsmanship of the cable TV era. ""True Blood"" and ""American Horror"" have got nothing on this show as far as raunchiness and grotesquery... Some of the characterizations are uneven, although the show gathers strength as it unfolds - one of the best threads is the update of Frankenstein, with a particularly compelling and innovative portrayal of the Monster.

Viewers who are squeamish or weary of gross-out tropes may want to avoid this one, though horror devotees will delight in its insistent, in-your-face bloodiness and creative creepiness. On balance, it is a powerful and purposefully unsettling show. Recommended, for the right viewers. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1414454400,,1743,5.6923076923076925

6410555,3,B00KACCIQM,"Penny Dreadful is a British/American horror series, presented by Showtime. The series makes an almost valiant attempt to combine three, four or more literary and cinema classics into one excessive and long episodic horror stew.

The protagonists include Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, the Dracula novel's entire cast of characters (Dracula, Mina, Renfield, Van Helsing etc.) Dorian Gay and his portrait, and (spoiler) an American cowboy/werewolf.  I suspect other monsters and story book characters will make their appearance before the series ends. (The Mummy maybe?). It all takes place in London.

The following items, in my point of view, are the main positives of the series: An obvious big budget as revealed by a multitude of extras, elaborate, expensive looking Victorian sets, buildings, gardens, streets and concert halls. Fine camera work, photography, framing, art direction and lighting. Well-tailored, authentic looking costumes. A decent bunch of seasoned actors, (albeit sometimes questionably directed). And finally, a certain charm in catching an occasional character or scene that is actually from one of the novels. Of course, this is only fun if one has read the novels.

The negatives: A jumbled script that jumps, starts, stops and sputters over and over again. Unnecessary over-the-top gore, blood, debauchery, and depravity, I suppose this is supposed to be in the style of the Grand Guignol, theater, which also make an appearance. Occasionally an actor seems to go in and out of character. There is a bad habit where the camera remains on characters facial reactions for an embarrassingly long time (this is likely the director or editor's choice and not the actors). There are a heap of uneven and confusing character decisions as well. And it's all performed in a very bloody stiff upper lip, dead serious manner without a hint of humor anywhere.  Even the darkest of Universal horror films had a bit of humor thrown in.  ""On your way, old fly eater""

Episodes one through three were over the top as already mentioned but still held my interest for a number of reasons (catching scenes from the novels for example).  But by the end of the fourth episode I was so numbed-out, bored and occasionally disgusted by the unadulterated excess that I could not continue with this series. My review does not go past season four.

If you watch a fair share of monster, vampire or thriller cinema you come to expect a degree of blood, gore and lechery, and that pretty much goes without saying.  In the case of Penny Dreadful there is blood, gore and lechery a-plenty in all varieties, shapes and sizes but it's heaped on with a trowel and it stops the momentum of the plot every time it appears.

I do not recall any animal cruelty in episodes one through three. Although there was plenty of human/monster cruelty, which is to be expected. We are talking Dracula, Frankenstein and Dorian Grey here. Seeing a man's body torn asunder by hand in glorious close-up or a woman with tuberculosis spewing blood in another's face during love making is typical of the many overly exaggerated nihilistic spectacles presented in the series.

Episode four raises the bar a big fat notch in human depravity, callousness, squalor, and disease with the addition of a big helping of simulated violence to animals and animal cruelty.

I think it is important for viewers who are sensitive to animal cruelty to understand what they are in. It's not fun. I have included a short description of the action that takes place around animal violence in episode four.  These examples will also serve as an idea of the kind of depravity this series generally presents as entertainment. (I don't believe these are spoilers because these scenes seem to have absolutely nothing to do with the plot)

A mad man called Fenton (based on Dracula's Renfield) is chained in a dark cellar screaming that he needs to devour insects and animals. A servant calmly walks into the room cradling a live cat. The servant suddenly and violently twists the cat's head, breaking the animal's neck with a sound crack. The servant then throws the dead animal's body at the mad man. The cat is devoured in closed up, as the Fenton/Renfield character uses his teeth to bite and tear at the animal's fur and flesh. The camera makes sure we do not miss any of the gore or the dead animal's insides. Three onlookers do little more then shrug.

A short while later two men enter a betting palace filled with what appear to be Victorian gentlemen. Baskets of rats are brought out and dumped into a pit. A cheering crowd begins to bet on how many rats a dog will kill. The dog is then introduced and thrown into the pit with the rats. The killing and gore produced by the battling animals is shown in raging, violent close up. The camera practically gets inside the dogs mouth as it slaughters the rats. The animal's blood is splattered on the clothes and faces of many men. One man appears to be in a euphoric ecstasy as he savors the blood he wipes from his face. Characters argue that only a weak man would turn away from the animal carnage. The animal battle scene seems to go on forever and after a time becomes inter-cut with scenes of men in a bar fight. The film-makers seem to be making a statement that there is some sort of equivalency between the men and animals, neglecting that the men fight by choice while the innocent animals are in survival as a reaction to an unnatural environment forced upon them by wacky script writers.

Beside the introduction of animal violence, Episode Four, as it's directed by Dearbhla Walsh, lost much of its coherent connection to the previous three episodes. It seems to me that the script writers realized they could not stretch the many plots and sub plots to fill the multitude of episodes this sereis will generate.  I suspect Dearbhla was handed a script that didn't progress the story or the characters but instead focused on anything-goes sex, gore, depravity, debauchery and animal cruelty for a big chunk of the episodes 45 minute length. What's a director to do?

I assume that Showtime believes this type of entertainment achieves ratings and audience loyalty. Showtime may be right, as I'm absolutely sure there is an audience for this type of entertainment as can be seen by the large quantity of four and five star reviews on Amazon.com. But for me, by the end of the fourth episode, Penny Dreadful's unadulterated excess managed to eclipse just about anything that is compelling or interesting about the worlds most famous horror icons.  The Penny Dreadful series will ultimately have allot episodes, I foresee no improvement and life is too short. So it's Goodbye Monsters.",1414195200,4,6703,4.863157894736842

6410560,5,B00KACCIQM,"My hubby and I love, love, love this series and can't wait for season two -- WARNING the rest of my review will contain spoilers so tread carefully.

As we often do, the hubster and I like to watch shows online and soak up a  season in a few days. Penny Dreadful left me wanting more with just 8 episodes in thier first season. The Victorian atmosphere? Beautiful!  Writing, heck yeah outstanding, what! And nods to old Horror miesters like Shelly, Wilde, Hawthorne, Melville and the like just makes me smile.

Now, to address the inevitable shrieks about nudity and sexuality in these episodes, which usually begin with ""I am not a prude but... (insert prude like statement).""  Dude. We don't live in a PG-13 world so why the desire to showcase everything ala Barney? Are we not adults?  Even if the sex is gratituious -- so what?  I don't think it detracts from the tale, in fact, in many parts it enhances, helping  highlight aspects of the story that may need  exemplifiying. Example, when Vanessa finally gives in to her lust for Dorian Gray and time stands still during coitus, we finally gleen the horrific nature of her awful curse. Could that aspect had been told sans sex?  Sure, but it was told BEST this way as in one fell swoop we see the sad reality of Vanessa fate, as she is doomed to be a passionate, sensual creature and yet never be able to give into her desires. I found that sex scene poignant, moving, dark, beautiful and tear jerkingly sad. Those who just saw gratituos sex truly missed the point of that scene altogether.

Why freak about this other primary, lovely and essential biolgical function? It's not like we are watching people take a dump -- we're watching something beautiful unfold and IMHO these scenes are tastefully done. Besides, as I said before things don't have to be necessary to be enjoybale additons, other wise, why add spice to anything?! Eye candy is nice and there is plenty to spare even outside the bedroom in Penny D.

Fan girl gush: I have to say I love every character within the tale, including Dorian Gray, who comes accross more haunted and pitiable than scary. The hubby and I were discussing this (Dorian is his least favorite character) and I came to the conclusion that Dorian Gray is being intpereted as more mysterious and forelorn as well as seductive and alluring as per Wilde.  Dark things can be intriuging, put perhaps not alluring to the mainstream--his darkness resides in his portrait which is one aspect of mystery that yes, I would not want to see as we can invent any montrosity  we wish upon the canvas. If anything, Grays picture should remain clothed more so than the actors. LOL!

My only quibble is with Vanessa's possession -- It felt too much like The Exorcist, not a bad thing per se, but I really felt they could have been a bit more creative with that aspect since they were toying with canon anyway.  Her battle took up an entire storyline and just felt too much like a been there and done that scenario. Still, the season ends with the enthralling premise of Vanessa perhaps learning to live with her demon and maybe even control it. Humph. If Dorian were half as smart as he thinks he is, he'd woo Vanessa by helping her learn to contain her monster so he can have his way with her.

Something tells me he's more vindicative than smart.

Dr. Frankenstien's creation getting a bride that turns out to be our gunsligner's woebegone Gaelic lassie was predictable but as far as forseeable thing go, still intruigng.  I can't help but wonder how that whole thing is going to turn out.

All and all a great start to a compelling series -- I hope they keep it inventive and imagntive while continuing  to prop  up the old maestros in this well crafted, decadent, dark world...",1414022400,3,3757,4.584454409566518

6410577,4,B00KACCIQM,"PD for short is one of those rare treats that comes along that are to far and few between in the sea of horror genre shows and movies out there. It hits its mark on every level (writing, acting, direction, cinematography) and oozes all the elements we horror junkies lust for. The story very cleverly melds so many of the classic horror story characters from the Victorian era aa well as taking place in this time period  Dr. Frankinstien (Treadway) Frankinstien (Kinnear), Vampires, Werewolves (Hartnett), Dorian Gray (Carney), possessed (Green) and more with a dash of a Sir Conan Doyle character mixed in (Dalton). The Victorian age is part of the backdrop to the story along with the industrial revolution that was sweeping the western world by storm. The advent of electricty, telegraph network information highway, spiritual reawakening and a wide range of effects it thrust upon the people of this era play a significant role in telling this story. There was only eight episodes for the first season, but we are treated with some very good story telling that helps us not only connect with the characters, but empathize with the personal demons they are at odds with to control and suppress from one another. We are only treated with small hints of their alter egos in some cases this season that I'm sure will be more widely explored/exposed next season to everyones delight and or horror???
The show can be fairly graphic (gore, body parts, autopsies) as well as full frontal/back male and female nudity with straight, gay and lesbian sex scenes. When there is cursing it too can be pretty graphic using the f...word and the c...word and others, however it is fairly infrequent.
I found the only real downside was the over use of the nude and sex scenes. Sometimes a story needs these elements to make the story, but this series is so well done it really doesn't need this to make or carry the story. ""Sometimes less is more"" Don't get me wrong I don't mind nudity if its needed or its for laughs, but as I mentioned I don't think this show needs the ""shock and awe"". Its that good, but only if the above mention items aren't to offensive. There are a few other somewhat minor things that I took issue with, but if I list them it might spoil a scene or give to much of the story away.

Not too sure initially, so I purchased only the first episode only to end up buying the entire series immediately.  I sat and watched the entire season this Saturday...I couldn't help myself - I watched the entire thing!  A couple of people mentioned the nudity and all the sex, and I had to stop and think...was there??  And with Dorian Grey/Gray, yes I guess there was but I have to say the sex or nudity was part of the story, not something just thrown in for whatever reasons nudity is normally added.  However, one point I recall thinking when Dorian and Josh Hartnett's character became ""friendly"" that I rolled my eyes because, ""Why are they adding this?""  And, I'm glad it was just that ONE scene.  It added absolutely nothing, in fact, it detracted from the film because all of a sudden a hunk like Hartnett is kissing and I'm thinking....why the hell did they do that, I hope they're not going to have an affair??  Thankfully, just thrown in.  I guess the same reason most homosexual scenes are added...I support gays.  Yeah, great, now quit throwing in these scenes that trash an otherwise creepy, horror movie that has me sitting on the edge of my seat.

But I was taken off guard and surprised how quickly the show ramped out and how good it was.

6410584,5,B00KACCIQM,"I'm not sure I can write a review that gives this work the credit I feel due.  John Logan is the genius behing this wonderful story and if his name doesn't ring a bell, his works will.  From Gladiator to Skyfall, Star Trek Nemisis to Rango, and Sweeny Tood, Hugo and The Aviator, he is a wonder of storytelling genius.  And Penny Dreadful is just that!  I read some posts from  people who were disapointed it was not a ""better slasher flick"", horror in the friday the 13th vein.  This is not that!!  Penny Dreadful is a lush, full story of great characters, bigger than life events with expert detail given to every aspect of its total grand experience.
  The music is a character all it's own.  Seldom have I heard such a glorious score flowing from one scene to another with a majesty of it's own.  There are breathtaking scenes that without the lush musical score would simply not be what they are.  But it is given center stage!
  Don't expect the same old stories.  While they are great, these are not them, once again, this work takes on new
territory.  We get all the classics, from Frankensein, to characters from Dracula;there is Dorian Grey and Mina and others you will recognize, but the stories are very differant, yet never dismissed or discounted in any way.  It is a new grand experience with these iconic creatures.  And there are new ones.  Our main figure, played with such energy from Eva Green that it takes your breath away.  I am certain she will not just be nominated,but will win the best actress catagory next Sept. But i digress(wait till you see her in all her characters glory..WOW!) ""Penny Dreadfuls"" were the pulp fiction books that the common people bought for a penny, filled with gruesome, bloody tales of horror for all to devour.  This is where the title comes from.  When I began watching I was ignorant of all this, I thought it referred to Eva Greens character.  Not even close, and that is how it goes with this tale out of  victorian London.  And you get a raw feeling of the stench of the streets, the disease and filth the common people dealt with daily, with juxtaposition placed almost subtly of the great wealth had by some.  Dorian Grey is one of the lucky, with wealth, beauty and nothing but time!  This storyline is one of my favorite.  Steeped in mystery and
suspense,lust and power, dark powers lurking just around  incredable beauty.
  So much of the story is told with this juxtaposition of beauty and decay, life and death, disease and renewal.  Sophisticated twists and turns, suspenceful and horrific, gory and beautiful, all at the same time.  And done with the ease of a talented dancer.  You can not know what is in store for you inside this incrediable story.  But if you are looking for a beautifully done and told mystery, horror, suspense tale within a tale within a tale, masterfully told with some of the most impressively beautiful language, music and cinematography I have seen, then Penny Dreadful is for you!  One of the more impressive things about this work is that it is nothing like you have ever seen on tv.  Every scene in every way feels like an expensively done, sweeping big budget movie.  And I already said what I think of Eva Green's preformance.  Josh Hartnett, out of nowhere gives the preformances of a lifetime.  I am so impressed his preformance.  Not an easy character, his also needs just thr right nuance to be done correctly.  And he nails it!.  Timothy Dalton is a powerhouse and gives another preformance of a lifetime.  I do not exaggerate!  All the others are impressive and powerful,there isn't a one that falls short.  I am usually not easy to impress when it comes to what I like in a series or movie, especially regarding the acting.  So when I say impressive, I truly mean just that.  This is a one of a kind  experience, not to be missed by those who enjoy the horror fantasy genre.  Those who do not like blood, gore and horror and it is considerable should beware.  The whole is so wonderful, the drama and acting, music and cinematography so well done, I wish you could see it.  But it is not for the squeemish.  From the 1st scene to the last it is hair raising, with alot of carnage, gore and blood...well done..lol..but certainly not for those who do not enjoy a good gorror...thats ""GOREORROR""...Can't wait for my Blu Ray to arrive thursday!",1413244800,6,4348,4.579220779220779

6410586,4,B00KACCIQM,"Penny Dreadful: The Complete First Season takes its name from the sensationalist serialized stories in newspapers and magazines of the Victorian Era. You could buy them for a penny, they were written with little subtlety, and the subject matter exploited the gruesome and ghastly. The Jack the Ripper murders were fresh in the minds of Londoners, and the penny dreadfuls became enormously popular.

The Showtime series incorporates assorted monsters, literary characters, and real-life personalities in a single storyline that often seems forced to include so many colorful ingredients. The first episode is rather slow, but by the second episode, all the relationships are in place. Set in 1891, the show places Victor Frankenstein, Dorian Gray, and Dracula alongside five new characters as they deal with dark and sinister situations. The Gothic flavor is sustained throughout and the production design adds immeasurably to atmosphere. If you know the original stories, the episodes resonate particularly  strongly. The cast includes Reeve Carney, Timothy Dalton, Eva Green, Rory Kinnear, Josh Hartnett, Billie Piper, and Danny Sapani.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include featurettes on the origin of penny dreadfuls, the Grand Guignol, and the science of medicine. Two episodes of Ray Donovan are also included.",1413158400,,1327,5.5594059405940595
6410587,5,B00KACCIQM,"Slowly paced, character-driven, romantic, and historically accurate.  Beautiful dark Victorian settings, costumes, background life.  The era is brought to life so well, that you lose yourself into the show visually.  Then, the acting begins.

WOW!  This is really the Eva Green show with everybody else playing a minor monstrous role, in my opinion.  If you are not scared and/or supremely creeped out when her character stares down a vampire and, on another occasion, gets possessed, you're lying to yourself to keep sane.  Check your pants.  You peed a little.  This show is scary.

Not that everybody else is not EXCELLENT.  They are.  No question.  The performances bring to life effortlessly such odd characters as Frankentein's monster (Caliban) and an American cowboy without coming off the least bit corny, cliche, or melodramatic.

And this cast of characters is diverse, unique, mysterious.

That frightening air of mystery that surrounds each character is a hallmark of this well-written show.  No one is expendable.  Not one character is written half-assedly.  Like the last twelve series characters you just watched on American TV.  The writers take their work seriously, and do a fantastic job.

Penny Dreadful makes traditional monsters scary and interesting again.  Vampires are horrific.  Demons and Satan are lurking about, and are a real threat.  Mad scientists and serial killers and Frankentein's monster, Oh My!  You get a new twist on Van Helsing, Mina Harker, vampires in general, and Dorian Gray!  Very cool.  Plus, some new characters that will touch your heart and freak you out (Proteus, for example).

Every character is worth following.  Every character has something dark and hideous to contend with.  Every character is a unique monster of his/her own.

The end of this season EXPLODES with an excellent twist that will make monster lovers NEED to catch Season 2.  :)

If there is any flaw, it might be its pacing--especially to us American audiences who have become used to Hollywood vomiting fast-paced drivel with too many explosions every Friday.

I find Penny Dreadful to be a darkly beautiful piece of film work that incorporates monsters intelligently, sacrifices none of their literary dignity, and snaps into horrific scares at just the right moments.

Instead we're given a handful of characters with preposterous story lines--chasing vampires (yawn) and creating Frankenstein's bride--and (for some reason) an American cowboy who's a werewolf. This show is more like ""True Blood"" than its own creation. This could have--SHOULD HAVE--been a whip-smart, chilling series; however, including characters such as Dorian Grey pushes this dangerously close to ""Once Upon a Time"" territory, albeit with a slightly more literary tone.

But the story is so convoluted and forced that I find myself rolling my eyes and guffawing, rather than gasping in shock. Perhaps I'm simply *too* well-acquainted with the material to take this seriously.

Also, not to sound like a prude, but at a certain point, everybody having sex with everybody else just becomes ridiculous. (This is a common problem when TV writers have a small ensemble cast like this.) The characters' motivations are inadequately explained, so you are constantly grasping for meaning and context. People make speeches and give each other meaningful glances, but it's like I tell the newbies in my writer's group: you're not building suspense when you withhold information; you're just irritating your audience.

This is what happens when the writers are more interested in the setting or concept than the characters: the characters end up being chess pieces that get moved around aimlessly in order to forward the plot. And by the way, they could have spent more time on the plot and less time standing around staring at each other. This is not a pacing issue, it's a competency in directing/writing issue.

EDIT: The second season is better, as it veers further from the literary roots into original-ish storytelling, and thus gives the characters space to develop.

Theres a wealth of highly successful constituents to go around in this first season, but for those excited to see Green, you're the biggest winners because she unequivocally steals the show. For the character of Vanessa Ives isn't normal in the least  her aptitude to invoke spiders in her preliminary scene proves it  but even with her out-of-this-world abilities, somewhat detached temperament mysterious and salacious quality she brings to bear, Green still manages to secrete just the slightest degree of human dignity and warmth to make her a strong character for the show  if anything she is indeed the lynchpin of the show.

Ethans character travels around with Colonel Brewsters Wild West Show gun-slinging to give the audience a quick thrill, but Vanessa has other plans for his skill set; she wants Ethan to join her and legendary explorer, Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton), on their assignment to rescue Sir Malcolms daughter (Mina Harker, of Dracula fame). Ethans the outsider getting his first glimpse in and that makes him the key to introducing viewers to this world, and Ethan has his own dark narrative to tell. Sir Malcolm Murray, a father and husband who seems to have lost his nearest and dearest. He seems only to have the single minded purpose to save his daughter Mina - that said Vanessa and Sir Malcolm seem to have cemented a rather dysfunctional father-daughter bond. He has interesting man servant who is quick with the blade  is his back story yet to be told? I am somewhat lost with Dorian Grey's role in the scheme of things - and has Dorian Grey (Dorian Grey's painting) finished seducing all the rest of the characters?

Frankensteins monster comes to life time and time again on celluloid. However, the success of this reimagining is almost wholly reliant on on Treadaways performance  and he pulls it off impressively. You see Treadaways intense commitment to the characters values and quirks turns Frankenstein into a many faceted main player in minutes, and that allows the viewer to feel the weight of his discoveries. Even though we've got zero information on Treadaways version of Dr. Frankenstein prior to the events of the first season, its difficult not to both understand and feel what this feat means to him through merely his austere yet wildly communicative reaction shots at times.

The performances here are very good, the visuals are outstanding and the carnage and creature work is particularly well done, but Penny Dreadful doesn't conjure that must-see feeling until the end of each episode. You find you honestly want to keep watching, but a little more momentum and energy during certain portions of the series couldn't have hurt. This series gives you rich, and at times sumptuous settings, there is curious mythology and enchanting characters, Penny Dreadful seems to have all the potential in the world  I keenly await season two.",1409097600,,2910,5.018672199170124
6410605,4,B00KACCIQM,"Showtime was wise to offer the premier of their latest series Penny Dreadful on a preview weekend. I watched and was captivated by the show enough to visit my cable provider and add the network. Having since also watched Masters of Sex, another new and engaging program, Id say the premier channel has a satisfied customer. Given that my cable provider makes dropping services more costly than adding ones (adding Showtime to my cable/internet bill, along with HBO, is now cheaper than it was without Showtime.go figure), it might not be as expensive as it seems to subscribe.

Most of the other reviews have summarized things pretty comprehensively, so Ill spare the re-hashing of the titles backstory and the character lineages. What have impressed me thus far are the atmosphere, the brilliant writing, and some magnificent acting. The show is a tour de force for Eva Green, demonstrating a range I had never known she possessed and making her performances positively spellbinding. Timothy Dalton plays the bereaved vengeful father with a simmering brew of arrogance, condescension, and guilt, befitting a wealthy Englishmen of the Victorian Era. Josh Hartnett is Ethan Chandler, a hot-headed American marksman playing up his cowboy role, and Harry Treadaway plays Victor Frankenstein as a bookish, socially inept fellow who is the cerebral balance to Hartnetts raging and macho Ethan. There are others of note (Billie Piper as the tragic prostitute  is there any other kind in such dramas?), but they are all not fully developed, especially the superfluous Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney  a man more known for his music than his acting). A heavy handed tool of unrestrained and unrepentant hedonism in the carefully maintained Victorian landscape, Gray hasn't yet been given a larger purpose. Sadly, he seems to be added more for titillation than anything else, and thats a shameful waste of Wildes most notorious fictional character. On the other hand, I truly enjoy Frankensteins creation (Rory Kinnear), a sympathetic yet angry being trying to find his place in a world that is appalled by him and has shown him little but cruelty. I like that he is a thoughtful and intelligent being instead of the plodding child-like one of popular culture, and am curious to see how he is brought along.

It bears note that Im not a big fan of the current glut of woefully uninspired supernatural programming, and even less of a fan of the horror genre. Additionally, while Ive read Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Portrait of Dorian Gray, not one of them is on my short list of favorite books. In short, Im not the target audience. Yet, the marketing prior to its debut was intriguing and the hauntingly gorgeous theme and visuals set the trap within minutes of my first glance, such that now Im thoroughly addicted. The writing is poetic and beautiful, if in a few cases a bit overdone, the acting is strong, in particular Green, Piper, and Kinnear, and the production as a whole is perfect. We are given a tragically gorgeous 19th century London, replete with the social disparities awash in dismal grays and muted elegance. While PD displays some growing pains, in particular thin characters and a penchant for throwing a lot of underdeveloped plot lines at the audience in order to attract a wide audience, it still offers plenty of upside going forward. I look forward with great enthusiasm to Season Two!",1407110400,15,3399,4.97887323943662

I think the writing and scripts for each episode are a little lack luster, amateur and boring. I will continue to watch for the rest of the season probably to give it a chance. Its not horrible. It just takes itself to serious, but its kind of silly at the same time, not funny, just silly. I think it may do better if there was a little more actual humor in it. Its kind of hard to describe it. It revolves around this gunslinger played by Josh Hartnet and a clairvoyant chick with a guilt ridden past played by Eva Green and the father of Mina Harker who has been kidnapped by Dracula played by Timothy Dalton. The actors do a good job with the script they have been given.  This is one of those Supernatural fests, like the show Supernatural (but not as good). It has everything in it from vampires to exorcisms and demons and ghost and prophecies and sances and Frankenstein and his monster, etc. There are two main plot lines going on. Eva Green, Josh Hartnet and Timothy Dalton are all trying to find Mina Harker in one story line and the other revolves around Dr. Frankenstein and his monster.

6410608,5,B00KACCIQM,"Although turn-of-the-last-century London feels like an almost too-familiar setting lately, what with all the movies and series that bring viewers back to the same relatively cramped street-grid and calendar-block, 'Penny Dreadful' is perhaps the best example of Gothic Horror I've seen. The actors, the writers, and directors, all evince a confidence with the material, a comfort with and understanding of the psychological underpinnings of the genre, and the neurotic repression that inspired the various monsters of the 19th century. Penny Dreadful accomplishes with apparent ease what so many others have failed at, making the vampire and the werewolf and Frankenstein's monster things to be feared, instead of campy relics of another age. The monsters that each generation favors speak to its' deepest anxieties. The notion of a Zombie Apocalypse, or any 'apocalypse' not related to Christian dogma, would seem ridiculous to Victorians. But the Zombie reflect our fears that the mistakes of previous generations (the dead) have set us on a self-destructive (cannibalistic) path, our thoughtless consumer culture  inevitably dragging us into an ecological abyss (the mindless and insatiable hunger of the undead; the criticisms of consumer culture inherent in the 'Zombie-Apocalypse'/'Survival Horror' genre -- strongest in Romero's 'Night/Dawn/Day of the Dead' trilogy, but present in both '28 Days Later', 'The Walking Dead' and many others-- almost always address the giddy thrill of wandering through empty stores, taking whatever's needed or wanted; often, the only moments of happiness involve cashless shopping sprees and fortuitous discoveries of untouched food and weapons). The favorite nightmares of the Victorians spoke to them as well. In a time when repression of natural urges was a must, when desires were never expressed or acted upon without social and even legal (ask Oscar Wilde) repercussions, the werewolf held a significance that has diminished with age. For the Victorians, the idea of losing control, turning into an animal, was one of their greatest worries, and the horror of having one's basest hungers exposed was as frightening as the beast itself. And while the explicitly sexual essence of the vampire is taken for granted in the 21st century, Bram Stoker's novel, with it's references to the drinking of blood and eternal damnation, expressed a very basic spiritual conflict. It suggested sexuality as a dangerous temptation, a curse; that giving in to lust and using others for sex was akin to feeding on their blood, their soul, and to risk damning not just yourself but them as well, infecting them. Sex was serious business, and never taken lightly. As attitudes toward sex changed, so did the view of vampires. They went from being 'the monster' to the tragic hero/anti-hero, and 'the curse' was sometimes considered 'the gift'. Frankenstein's terrible creation, in Penny Dreadful taking the name 'Caliban' (from Shakespeare's final play, 'The Tempest'), is an articulate and less physically imposing vision of Shelley's original. This reflects a deep philosophical shift -- Mary Shelley's Monster was 'born' an innocent, essentially good, an expression of the 'radical' liberal beliefs of her parents and Jean-Jacques Rousseau that man is born good, and that it is society that corrupts. 'Caliban' represents the flip side of the nature/nurture argument, a thoroughly unlikable and self-obsessed being who paradoxically claims he is superior to mortal man, yet hates Victor Frankenstein, his creator, ostensibly because he abandoned the screaming, bloody, naked, freak seconds after 'stealing fire from the gods'. Both versions express a fear that is not limited to any time or place, a fear that is older than the written word, the fear that our children might one day become monsters. Regardless of what we believe about human nature, every parent worries that their son or daughter might go 'wrong'; I wonder if Adolf Hitler's mother read Frankenstein...

Penny Dreadful re-creates a world of manners and unbending, unending social judgement, where the aristocratic upper classes live a sophisticated existence of material comforts and intellectual pursuits, while the lower classes live with open sewers and rats and a thousand deadly or disfiguring infectious diseases. Fictional characters from 19th Century literature converge on this Victorian England far nastier than the various London's of pulp and ink they knew. Dr. Frankenstein is a bit older than he appears; he should be as grey-haired and stiff in the joints as Abraham Van Helsing. Shelley created the character as a teen, and published her book anonymously in 1818. Mina Harker's father, Malcolm Murray, and the decadent immortal Dorian Gray, with his painted-Azazel, are more at home in the 1890's.

The story revolves around Sir Malcolm Murray's search for his daughter, who is, of course, the Mina Harker from Dracula. He is aided by Mina's childhood friend, a Medium named Vanessa Ives (played by Eva Green, who is excellent, as always; there are no actresses that can combine beauty and sexual allure with such an utterly convincing menace. She has the ability to focus those gorgeous blue-grey eyes like weapons, from 'a withering gaze' to a full-on assault. She portrays Ives with a haunted perfection -- the viewer can intuit the characters' tormented history long before it is recounted). The two seek out further help of a more violent nature from Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett, who also does a nice job), recruited from a travelling 'Wild West' show, where he wore makeup and impressed the crowds as a trick-shooter. Chandler is the one major character who doesn't have a literary connection of some sort; I wonder if, earlier in the shows development, they tried shoe-horning in an American character like Tom Sawyer, before someone remembered how lame that turned out in the terrible film adaptation of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and decided their American character could remain a mystery. If so, good call. The secret that he protects until the final minutes of the season is far more dramatic. I doubt many people were too shocked by the revelation, since the writers and directors pretty much beat you over the head with it;&nbsp;&nbsp;the women being torn to shreds, Chandler waking up disheveled and disoriented, the scene in the zoo, and even the imagery in the opening credits, all might as well be replaced with a neon sign. But I watched the series over a two day period, and it's easier to forget the details going a week between episodes. Needless to say, it'll be fun to see what they do with it next season.

In the first episode, the viewer experiences the action from Chandler's POV, following Murray and Ives through the filth-strewn cobble-stone streets, down a maze of alleys and courtyards and stables, oblivious as to where they're going, who or what they're looking for, or why.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vampires they find are not the one they're looking for, obviously, but in a nice Del Toro-esque detail, the eldest one possesses an exo-skeleton under it's skin (which I guess means it isn't technically an exo-skeleton, but close enough). It is covered in ancient characters and glyphs, which brings them to a seriously anti-social Victor Frankenstein for help in making sense of the creature. Eventually, they convince him to work for them, but the Doctor is deeply immersed in experiments of his own, and you can likely guess what kind. Things take a shocking turn for Dr. Frankenstein, and the viewer, later on. Dorian Gray is the final member of their little gang, but remains on the outer periphery, usually a negative, destabilizing presence, but difficult to resist. He is introduced as he seduces a young woman dying of Tuberculosis (played by former Dr. Who star Billie Piper), kissing her even as she coughs up a bloody, infectious froth in his mouth, in what is probably the unsafest sex scene in TV history. Other literary characters make appearances, such as Abraham Van Helsing, and there are some very unexpected turns in the action (as well as some predictable twists, but audiences are so savvy anymore it's impossible to shock them at every juncture... not to mention dangerous. Trying to baffle viewers was what led 'Lost' so far from shore with it's scripting that it barely made it back. Sometimes I think it's better for TV writers to avoid fan sites and reviews. Novelists don't stop at the end of each completed chapter to check online for reader response; it would drive them insane).

The notion of placing characters like Dr. Frankenstein and Dorian Gray in the same end-of-the-century London that Jack the Ripper inhabits was risky and interesting, but not very original, so this show entered battle with a bullet in its leg, and I was prepared to let it die if it didn't grab me in the first few minutes. Thankfully, it proved to be very entertaining from the start, so I didn't give up on it. The more I watched, the more I appreciated just how flawlessly it executed the task of updating Gothic Horror while remaining true to it's essence. It's not high art, by any means, but it is beautifully shot and the acting is superb. But then, Gothic Horror was never high art -- 'Dracula' by Stoker, Shelley's 'Frankenstein', even the stories of Charles Dickens and Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', all were the 19th century equivalents of the authors you find on the New York Times Bestseller List. But shows like Penny Dreadful and Game of Thrones demonstrate how popular entertainment can transcend the perceived limitations of their medium. There's a brilliant and understated moment of meta-narrative in episode 7, when Dr. Frankenstein is examining Vanessa Ives as her self-control is usurped by the demonic presence inside her. She quotes a line of poetry from 'Adonais', an elegy for Keats (who was mentioned earlier by the Egyptian Vampire/Demon in Murray's likeness), by Percy Bysshe Shelley. She quotes from a poem about the death of a 'creator', written by the husband of the woman who created HIM. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, 'the Modern Prometheus', is visibly disturbed, as if he just had a brush with the 'Promethea' who gave him life, and could unmake his fictional bones with a whisper. Clever work for a TV show, but the television series isn't a 'trash medium' anymore. It was the same with comics, and now video games; 'trash mediums' don't exist. Great things can be created anywhere at anytime, whether it's executed in spray paint on a box-car or a mass-produced graphic on the back of a cereal box (it could happen... but I'm not holding my breath).

The sets and the wardrobe are appropriately ostentatious or dilapidated, depending on the scene, and the dialogue is written by someone with a good ear for the many accents and their subtle variations. Josh Hartnett returns from... wherever Josh Hartnett's been, to lend some American charisma, and Timothy Dalton is the perfect choice for Malcolm Murray, given an Alan Quatermain-like past as an African Adventurer, an aristocrat who knows how to throw a punch and fight with a knife. Billie Piper gives a remarkable performance as the doomed prostitute who falls in love with Chandler; the show has been renewed for a second season, and it looks like she'll have a large role to play, despite the obvious handicap of being dead. I imagine the writers and producers have plans for Reeve Carney's Dorian Gray to become more of a central character in season 2, but Gray is a tricky one to write for. Wherever the coming episodes take this series, I have no doubt its audience will continue to grow. There are more horror series being developed than ever before, but this might turn out to be the best of the lot.",1405900800,28,11761,5.091191709844559
6410609,5,B00KACCIQM,"I went into Penny Dreadful hoping to like it. I never expected that I would love it as much as I did. It looks beautiful -- the sets and costumes are works of art. The stories are tense, fraught with emotion, and darkly twisted. But the real gem of this show is the characters themselves. The actors are amazing, especially Eva Green. Each and every one of them brings such an incredibly nuanced performance to each episode. There is a vulnerability to each of them, coupled with a morally ambiguous edge that makes for fantastic viewing. I never thought my heart would break for Dorian Gray! If you are a fan of the dark Victorian, you must watch this show.",1404950400,2,658,4.491666666666666
6410610,5,B00KACCIQM,"To some extent this series is a bit of a mess! There is so much going on that it's easy to get lost amongst the mixture of plot elements that appear to have been put together rather in the manner of someone cheating when completing a puzzle by cutting the first pieces they pick up to force them to fit. We have Frankenstein's creation displaced in time and space competing for top spot with Dracula who appears to have spirited Mina away from a father she never originally had. He seems to be a kind of Allan Quartermain explorer type obsessed with finding the origin of the Nile and racked with guilt over the loss of both children: his son accompanied him on one ill-fated trip. Buffalo Bill, in the guise of Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) also plays a prominent part together with Dorian Gray convincingly mincing his way through the lot and corrupting any and every one he can literally lay his hands upon. And in the monster's attraction to Maude, an ingnue playing at the local Grand Guignol theatre, there is even a hint of Gaston Laroux's famous phantom.

Central to all this mayhem is the figure of Vanessa Ives played by Eva Green who gives an astonishing performance as the possessed friend of Mina whose aforementioned father, Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton), is convinced holds the key to his daughter's fate: so chuck in a bit of the Exorcist as well! A brilliantly hammy turn by Simon Russell Beale as an utterly dotty Egyptologist and a curious sprinkle of Billie Piper as a consumptive Irish whore completes the dish. All we are missing is the slightly puzzling absence of Mr Hyde: but (hopefully) it's still early days yet!

So, utterly unoriginal and yet utterly compelling: it plays upon the viewer's knowledge of all of those Gothic ingredients to create a heady brew that looks absolutely sumptuous and is very, very definitely for adult consumption only. This is the grown-up relative of the recent Jonathan Rees Myers, Dracula which, though good, is a pale shadow of this gloriously exotic concoction.

This is the most exciting series I've seen. It`s a beautifully polished production with so many great performers in one series. Eva Green especially, beautiful with so much vitality in her performance, her background as a young girl, walking through the maze was dark and exciting. Her guilt. When Mina walked in on her fiance fornicating with Vanessa, Vanessa with her head, and  eyes, upside down luridly watching her, the perpetually bored Dorian suffering through one more orgy.  Here was someone that had been around for a long time, had experienced most things there were to experience, yet he looked about the room as if to say ""what else is there?"".  Brona coughed up in Dorian's face and he found it to be a turn on, he asked if she felt things more because she was dying. I thought Dorian was beautiful, the way he thoughtfully pondered when questioned. But he was also cruel, at the expense of others, being hungry for new experiences. The guilt Vanessa felt while copulating with Dorian was a portal for evil to come through and take over her.  The sex scenes were significant parts of the plot. Not for shock value! The most interesting part was the exchange between Caliban and Maud. Maud an ingenue at first treated him with kindness having no idea that she was dealing with a sick and twisted creature, and the sad consequences of his pathetic misunderstanding . The treatment of the animals was bothersome. Other than that I enjoyed the whole package and never saw anything quite like Penny Dreadful. It`s terrific.

6410613,5,B00KACCIQM,"The first thing that many people who see the title of Showtime's latest foray into original programming end up asking themselves is ""What the heck is a Penny Dreadful?"" and it's a totally valid question. Penny Dreadfuls were short stories that became popular in the Victorian era of London amongst the working classes. They were sparsely written, cheaply printed, lurid horror and crime stories that were sold for... a penny, making them an early form of the art form that we would come to know as ""pulp fiction"". It is this type of literature that has, in part, inspired showrunner/writer John Logan (SKYFALL, THE LAST SAMURAI), along with his SKYFALL director Sam Mendes, to create a show with many of the elements of the Penny Dreadfuls (horror, sex, gore, monsters, the supernatural), but to give it a level of sophistication in content, writing, plotting and performance that is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Showtime's other brilliant original shows like MASTERS OF SEX and HOMELAND.

The show focuses around a quintet of desperate and lost souls: Vanessa Ives (Eva Green, CASINO ROYALE) is a strong, independent modern woman whose soul is torn between darkness and light; Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton) is a fierce explorer who has returned home to constantly increasing tragic occurences; Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) is a brash American ex-patriate and performing sharpshooter fleeing from his own dark past; Brona Croft (Billie Piper, DOCTOR WHO) is a brave but tragic Northern Irish lass suffering from consumption, and Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) who has a price to pay for exploring the fringes of science. Murray and Ives have brought Chandler and Frankenstein into their quest to find Murray's daughter Mina (Olivia Llewellyn) and save her from the preternatural evil she has fallen victim to. Also inserting himself into the lives of these characters at different times is the beautifully young and hedonistic Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney), and always around the periphery is Frankenstein's creation, now called Caliban (Rory Kinnear), who hates his creator for abandoning him.

Using characters that are extremely well-established in Victorian literature like Shelley's Frankenstein, characters from Stoker's DRACULA, such as Mina Harker and Abraham Van Helsing (David Warner), and Wilde's Gray might give the viewer bad flashbacks of a B-grade attempt at making another LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, but thankfully that is not the case. Aside from who these characters are, they exist mostly on the periphery of their own stories so they can firmly exist in this new tale, which is part of the show's genius. Many of the new characters are archetypes (Chandler as the handsome and fearsome Yankee gunslinger, Ives as the beautiful and darkly mysterious woman) that through extensive characterization and incredibly solid acting, grow far beyond the archetypal characters they would be in something lesser. Dalton does probably his best work in decades here as the volatile yet controlled Sir Malcolm. Treadaway is exceptional as the egotistical yet fearful Frankenstein. Carney is pitch perfect as Gray, with his orgies and absinthe and his appreciation of beauty and its duplicity. Piper is wonderful as Brona, projecting a courage and sexiness in the face of her withering, although her northern Irish accent might take a bit to get used to. Kinnear is tremendous as ""the creature"", who plays the both the tragic and the fury of his situation, but still demands empathy and compassion. Hartnett does his most complex work yet here as the hired gun with several depths still to plumb. But while all of these actors do great, and in some cases, career-best work, the show thoroughly belongs to Eva Green. With her piercing eyes, her smooth and easy smile, and the way she seems to glide across a room; all of this belies a great darkness and fearsome sexuality behind her beauty and charm and class. The arc of Vanessa, as we discover it, from the incredibly intense seance scene in Episode 2, to her dark and tragic past revealed in Episode 5 to her utter desperation and horror in Episode 7. The finale might feel a little on the weaker side because it's not terribly surprising. Everything that you think is going to happen does happen, with the exception of one HUGE shocking revelation about one of the characters near the end that some people say audiences are able to see coming from early on in the show, but I never saw it coming. At all. There's also a brilliant scene with Vanessa and a Welsh priest where they talk vaguely about her possession and how whatever is inside her has changed her into something abnormal. The priest replies, ""Do you really want to be normal?"" and knowing what the characters do, the question is indeed prescient.

The visual feast this program also serves up is a delight of beauty and grotesqueries. Gray's home and its absence of anything practical except for his dozens and dozens of portraits; Ethan and Brona's dockside squalor; Victor's dank and cluttered laboratory; the Murray home with its huge maps and imposing heights and depths, and the theatre of the Grand Guignol (the theatrical equivalent of the penny dreadful) which invokes amazement, gore-filled horror and heartbreak; all of these things help establish not only the setting but the tone and atmosphere of the show. It also has no shyness for the more sensational elements either. The show has heaping helpings of gore, nudity and sex, much like the penny dreadfuls of old, and thankfully, it seldom seems gratuitous.

It's easy to pigeonhole PENNY DREADFUL as a horror show, but that's just scratching the surface of a multi-faceted drama of damaged and desperate people suffering from and/or committing horrifying acts. But under the skilled and careful eyes of Logan and Mendes, this is another amazing program from Showtime and easily one of the best new shows of 2014.",1403913600,285,5938,5.068507157464213
6410614,2,B00KACCIQM,"The actors are excellent, a startlingly good cast.
The period pieces are Very well executed.

The stories.... are half finished bits and pieces randomly thrown together that are left unresolved.

(And .... yes, I am aware that Penny Dreadfuls were short stories.)
The difference is that short stories have a beginning, middle and end (even if strands are left deliberately dangling).
They also have a point, a coherent story that is self contained.

It feels like the pages of multiple stories were thrown together in a blender.
Vampires, demons, werewolves, Frankenstein..... sometimes all in an episode and frequently with no particular plot to hold the logic together.

There Is stated to be an over-arching plot but the random, disorganized manner in which it is approached on again, off again (mostly off) completely destroys any sense of urgency to the point where one wonders if it was just a maguffin to drag the cast together.

Save the show. Can the writer.

Truthfully, the real monster here is the writer. He takes a marvelous cast and production crew and sends them round and round with no plot or remotely credible plan (even given ALOT of latitude).",1403827200,16,1164,4.974226804123711
6410615,4,B00KACCIQM,Obviously haven't seen the bluray yet but wanted to comment about the show for those who may have stopped watching it. I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not for the first two shows but I hung in. The last three shows have been incredible. Eva Green gave an amazing performance in the last one (6-22-14). I really hope this gets another season. If you haven't seen it or stopped watching it early on try to catch the reruns.,1403827200,2,425,4.325

6410617,5,B00KACCIQM,"Please keep the seasons coming.  You can't wait till the next show.  Josh Hartnett is spellbounding.  I've seen a lot
of horror shows, but none can compare to this show.  The performances are on target with the atmosphere of the time it is centered in.  Hartnett's brooding personality , classic good looks and mesmerizing voice fits his character right on que.  Penny Dreadful is a spectacular show.",1403136000,4,400,4.895522388059701
6410618,5,B00KACCIQM,"If you like the genre, then this is the best you will ever see. There are constant surprises, the scenery, costumes, and photography constitute a work of art in themselves, and every actor creates a convincing character. The language is beautiful and their voices and delivery of the lines convince me that the cast is among the finest talent alive today-hypnotizing. The casting director (or who ever assembled this cast) is a genius. I can not imagine anyone else in these roles. Each actor cast his or her own kind of spell upon the viewer. I have never been one to be anxious for the next episode in anything in the past, but now I understand how one can get that way. Mystery and the supernatural, eroticism and the physical beauty of the actors make the show rather addictive. Of course you must see it in order of the episode to get the full effect and power that has been captured, and you are cheating yourself if you don't. I am now a real fan of every actor in the show and have the greatest respect for all the hundreds of creative people who caused it to materialize.",1402531200,13,1080,4.459595959595959
6410619,2,B00KACCIQM,"Filmed half in the dark with a script to match, Penny Dreadful does a disservice to a good cast by serving up threadbare monster themes and delaying audience involvement with any one character. 4 episodes in and I know 3 things.\
  1. There isn't enough time spent with any one character to make me care about any of them.
  2. The world is in grave danger from dark forces. ( Now they ,yawn, have my full attention.)
  3. They have managed the impossible in one sense and made Eva Green unattractive.
Although it hasn't happened yet, I think we know whose spare parts are going into Frankenstein's offspring's bride. I won't be there to see it .",1402444800,14,646,4.478632478632479
6410620,1,B00KACCIQM,"This is a gothic retelling of classic monster tales like Dracula and Frankenstein. The idea is sound and it is well crafted but the plot has some issues that should have been taken care of before production began. Plot points don't fit together very well and the time line is off kilter. The addition of tons of graphic sex (much of perverted/twisted) does nothing to move the story along. In fact it makes matters worse and slows down the story to a crawl since much of it has noting at all to do with what is going on. We get that Dorian Grey is morally bankrupt and loving it but we don't get the guy/girl, girl/girl, guy/guy action every ten seconds. Is this a porn flick or a horror series? I'm totally confused. I can see that some of it explains the character's motives or history but aside from that there is too much sex going on and not enough monster action.",1402358400,31,869,4.37037037037037
6410621,4,B00KACCIQM,"I like when a show like this first starts. It usually is good before hitting season 3 which for most go downhill but still we tune in because the first several seasons got us hooked to the characters, plot or something and we all like closure. Just watched the 4th episode and to be honest not quite sure what direction they are going in - and that latest scene between Ethan and Dorian just had me going ""huh?"" But I already know I will  stay tuned because for those that like their shows dark and supernatural, only ones on regular TV are oriented to teens (imo), so I'll take what I can get. As to the sex scenes...it comes with the territory and definitely made a lot of paid tv shows popular so probably thinking thats what they are going for. Time will tell.",1401753600,4,764,4.305555555555555
6410622,4,B00KACCIQM,"I cannot stop watching this show/ I continue to be amazed at the level of depth these actors bring to their characters...truly masters of their craft. I find each of their characters so engaging. Mr. Kinnear's portrayal of the creature made my heart ache for this character as a poor lost soul. Perhaps it is Mr. Kinnear's training as a Shakespearian actor which brings such richness to this character. Ms. Green is simply phenomenal, and she has clearly mastered the difficulties that this role must present with the highs and lows of this character's temperament.
Josh Hartnett is not only wonderful to look at, but he conveys the melancholy of his existence as he lives between the worlds of good and evil.
Sir Malcolm is wonderful as is the mysterious Sembene and evil Mrs. Poole.

Last night's episode was particularly good until...and I resort back to my original criticism, the sex scenes went over the top. The audience gets it...the Victorian Era was one of repression yet with an under current of bawdiness. During the day you had proper women, covering piano legs, contrast to Victorian brothels. It was a dark era. Anyone who knows anything about Victorian history knows this. But I could have done without the more explicit sex scenes. I opened up my laptop and started reading work emails during those portions. Nothing against sex at all, just not entertained by it. So I have resigned myself to continue watching this wonderful show, and just turn away from the parts I find uninteresting. Please note this is a review of the May 31st episode not Nightwork",1401667200,11,1572,4.843866171003717
6410623,5,B00KACCIQM,"Penny Dreadful is exceptionally well written, and the period tone is captured perfectly. Story arcs are twisting and twisted and Eva Green is just stunning in her portrayal. Billie Piper nails her Northern Irish accent - in fact the entire cast is faultless. Best thing on UK TV screens for a long long time!!",1401408000,4,309,4.7407407407407405
6410624,3,B00KACCIQM,"I'll be addressing two issues: the content, and the content, with pros and cons of both.
First, this is a very atmospheric show, and I like the low-lit dingy feel of it. So far, it has the air of what a procedural should be; the mystery is drawn out (even though everyone except for the actual characters knows that they're chasing Dracula (Whoops, spoilers!). I like the fact that vampires are evil again, and I appreciate the comparison of Dracula and the Devil; it makes for a very creepy vibe, and it's nice to see that they're borrowing a good chunk from their source material (Dracula is the only book I've actually read that pertains to the series; I hardly recognize any of the other characters).
The cons side of the content is that the action can get a bit muddled sometimes. Not so much like the action SCENES, though those can be a little hard to follow on account of the aforementioned low lighting, but the fact that everyone MUMBLES makes the story a tad hard to follow. Motivations are a little weird too, at times, but I suppose figuring out why someone did something is all part of the fun.
Now for the content: somewhat connected to content above, but slightly different. The characters are pretty cool cucumbers, for the most part. I like the interplay between Frankenstein and his monster (and his other monster), which almost makes me want to read Frankenstein. Almost. Also, Josh Hartnett's character is a werewolf, so that's pretty awesome. Miss Ives is an odd character, and I'm not sure at all (1) where she comes from in literature or (2) what she's supposed to be. All in all, this is like what League of Extraordinary Gentleman should have been; less overproduction, more acting.
Cons: Sex. I don't like my television or my movies coital, and this has some long drawn-out sex scenes. It's uncomfortable, arguably unnecessary, and just flat-out rude. This ruined Game of Thrones for me as well; good acting, good cinema, terrible morals. And don't give me excuses like, ""It's more historically accurate."" or ""It's what the character would do."" or ""It helps you sympathize with the characters."" It brings in viewers, and it makes you numb. It desensitizes, demoralizes and hides out in your mind making up excuses for sin. You're probably is putting together a defense right now, and you don't even know why.
There's also cursing, the occult, gore, fun stuff like that. I don't like that either, but this is a dark show, and that's something I pretty much expected. Besides, you gotta have a bad guy, and this bad guy is particularly spiritual in nature. I just wish the good guys acted more like, you know, good guys; hunting evil doesn't mean you have to become evil, and those that do have already lost the fight.",1401148800,13,2743,4.704781704781705
6410625,3,B00KACCIQM,"Icky spiders and ghoulie monsters and seances and a sickening amount of blood and grunge can't quite mask the silly melodramatic nature of this series.  It's like the Addams Family meets Frankenstein meets Night of the Living Dead, all thrown together in a gussied-up, costumed, Victorian mishmash.  The central thrust of the proceedings is that Timothy Dalton is trying to find his lost daughter.  She occasionally reappears, perhaps the victim of demon spirits.  Meantime, you have Dr. Frankenstein's ""first-born"" coming back to threaten him, and Dorian Gray (yes, that Dorian Gray) surfacing for no apparent reason (looking dandy in morning coat and such) other than why don't we throw every conceivable literary monster allusion into the mix, and Renfield lifted out of Dracula, and plenty of large-breasted tavern wenches for the obligatory, gratuitous sex scenes.  There's even an Egyptologist deciphering hieroglyphics and warning us that bad things are ahead.  Not half as bad, I might add, as sitting through future episodes of this claptrap.  It's silly and pretentious and obvious.  Clunk-clunk.",1401062400,14,1106,5.426900584795321
