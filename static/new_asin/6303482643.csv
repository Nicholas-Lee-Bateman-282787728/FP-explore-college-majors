670393,5,6303482643,"Terror of the Autons is not only my favouite story of the Jon Pertwee era of Doctor Who, but it is also my favourite Doctor Who story of all time. The story not only brings back the Nestine Autons, but it also marks the  first appearance of the Doctor's ""best enemy"". The Master. The  Doctor, with the help of UNIT must figure out a way to stop the Master from  channeling the entire Nestine Invasion fleet to Earth before it's too late.  Jon Pertwee's performance as the Doctor is dead posh and the scenes between  him and Roger Delgado (the Master) are such a treat to watch. Although all  the Doctor/Master stories I've seen thus far have been nothing short of  great, this one is the first and by far, the best out of all of them. A  must have for not only fans of Jon Pertwee, but fans of Doctor Who in  general.",950659200,15,817,4.253246753246753
670394,5,6303482643,"The Nestenes are back and this time they are helped by one of the Doctor's own people, ""The Master"".  The Master steals the last surving Nestene unit that a Museum loaned from UNIT HQ.  The Master finds a nearby  radio telescope the reactivate the Nestence unit, and then takes over a  family owned plastic factory to make Auton bodies and other plastics for  the Nestene to use in their attempt to take over Earth.  When Doctor Who  fans talk about the Master they always bring up Roger Delgado, and why not.  Delgado's Master is a con-man, a talker, a man that shows his vanity(his  weekness), and most imporantly someone who can completely control the minds  of people (more less), including the Doctor's new companion Jo Grant played  by Katy Manning. Delgado does not dispoint in his frist story as the Master  and after watching it, you will say Delgado ""IS"" The Master.  The  attacks by the Nestene are much better in this story, ranging from the  Autons who are more frighing in this story, to killer dolls, and plastic  flowers, even the telephone cords are lethal.  This is the last appearance  of the Nestene, but it's the first of many confrontations the Doctor will  have with the Master.  If you love this kind of Doctor Who adventure,  you'll love ""Terror Of The Autons"".

670608,4,6303482643,"Terror of the Autons kicked off Series 8 of the Classic Doctor Who.  The Autons were a decent threat, but not an overshadowing one unlike the Daleks or the Cybermen. The serial served as an introduction for both a new companion and the Doctor's archenemy, the Master.

The Doctor is fairly clever in this one though does seem to be a bit of a prima dona as he relates to the Brigadier and others around him.

On the companion side, Jo was a definite mental downgrade from scientist Liz Shaw and the previous female companion Zoe, but she makes up in other ways, as she saves the Doctor's life a couple times with her training as a civilian UNIT agent. She's generally sunshiny and a notch about 1960s companions like Victoria and Paulie.

As for the Master, the story gives me an impression that he's the Doctor's version of a Bond villain who manages to come up with the most off the wall schemes and choose stylistic evil plans rather than practical and simple ones that might actually work . The Master gains control over plastic and proceeds on a spree of murders and attempted murders that kills victims in the most undignified ways: death by inflatable chair, death by ugly looking plastic doll, death by plastic flower, and attempted murder by phone cord. Yep, the Master sneaks into UNIT HQ installs an extra long phone cord, so he can call, speak to the doctor and command the phone cord to strangle the doctor. Merely planting a small bomb is something for lesser villains to do.

And then there's his outrageous plastic flower distribution...As the Doctor points out, the Master's plans are most often inefficient and impractical, no matter how ingenuous they are.

Still, the Master is set to be a truly worthy foe for the doctor in every single story of this season. This story is just the proverbial tip of the iceberg.",1394496000,2,1833,4.6419753086419755
670609,5,6303482643,"The Return of the Autons and the introduction of Jo Grant and Roger Delgado as The Master. I loved this episode when I first saw it decades ago, and love it just as much now!",1391904000,,174,4.0
670737,5,6303482643,"This is more exciting to watch compared to Spearhead From Space. I saw this twice. Spearhead From Space and Terror of the Autons are somewhat difficult for me to understand. Due to its heavy intelligent dialogue.  It's alot better than modern 2005 Doctor Who epidode Rose from Series 1 with the 9th Doctor pops out of nowhere.

The Brigadeire Lethridge Stewart assigned the Doctor a new assistant named Josephine Grant. Since Elizabeth Shaw already went back to Cambridge to become a science major.

The Master played by Delgado, is good at hipnotizing people. Especially the guy at the circus. He even took over the plastic dolls factory. The autons disguise themselves as  carnival dummies with yellow hats. And uses dafodils. A sunflower like plant to spray peoples face covered in plastic.

I heard The Master is stuck on Earth.
Well, it's a much better story than Spearhead From Space. This has alot of action when The Doctor and Jo were rescued by 2 police officers, who turned out to be faceless Autons.

The episode Rose, seems childish. That was the first Doctor Who episode I watch on PBS. Then I explored watching alot of Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker and Peter Davison.

Best Auton story out of the 3.

Coming from an attention defictit illiterate guy from me. Yeah, I love it!!!!",1365724800,2,1285,4.782805429864253
670738,5,6303482643,I love the classic series.  I'm not dissing the new series.  But there's something special about the older stuff. And you can't beat Degado for being the Master!,1360281600,,161,4.714285714285714
670739,4,6303482643,"That's the main reason I got it, and it's pretty good overall.  The Master was a great villain, & the Autons are really creepy.  I can see why this episode caused a controversy.  And the Doctor was his usual good self as always.  But there is one thing I didn't like about it: His new companion Jo Grant.  I know I said I liked her in the other Third Doctor adventure I saw, but here she was stupid, at least in parts 1 & 4.  She was fine in parts 2 & 3 though, but still her low points were annoying.  But it's still a good serial, just not the best.",1359072000,,551,3.90990990990991
670740,5,6303482643,I liked this story. Just like the other if you like Doctor Who you will like this one. The special effects are cheesy but a good story.,1356393600,,135,4.037037037037037
670741,4,6303482643,"""Terror of the Autons"" is one of the few entries in Doctor Who series to genuinely live up to its billing as a ""terror"" story. And it marked a major milestone in the series as well, introducing a recurring villain to the Doctor's now Earth-bound adventures, the Master, and one of the Doctor's most popular companions, Jo Grant.

As noted in the Special Features, the Master was conceived by producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks to serve as a sort of Dr. Moriarty character to match wits each week with the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes. The Time Lords had exiled the Doctor to Earth at this point in the series as punishment for interfering with time--and to save the BBC money.

The genius in this otherwise quotidian casting decision lay in the choice of veteran BBC character actor Roger Delgado to play the role. Actress Katy Manning says Delgado's sinister gaze was enough to make one's blood run cold, and he would remain a popular, if malevolent, feature of the series until his untimely death in 1973.

The casting of Manning as the Doctor's new companion, Jo Grant, also set off somewhat of a viewer mania. Manning's on-screen energy alongside Jon Pertwee as the Doctor was obvious from the beginning, despite her pixie build and the little-known fact that she was extremely shortsighted and did not wear eyeglasses on the set.

The return of the Autons aided by the Master includes several genuinely unsettling scenes: a man being smothered by an inflatable plastic chair, a policeman unmasked to reveal a faceless Auton underneath, and a character being attacked and killed by an ugly plastic troll doll. My wife and daughter walked into the room just as the troll doll was coming to life and, even without the benefit of context, were sufficiently creeped out by what they saw to beg me to turn the show off. The story received numerous complaints at the time that it would make children afraid of policemen and their own toys. Virtually all of these complaints came from adults, of course.",1309737600,4,2015,4.7982708933717575
670742,5,6303482643,"This is a watershed story for several reasons. It introduces both Jo Grant and The Master and the Pertwee/Letts formula really gels as the production team hits its second-season stride.  Except for the 4-part 'Spearhead from Space' the four stories in Pertwee's first season were far too long and padded, running 7 episodes each. One slightly clunky seven-parter like 'Ambassadors of Death' and there's more than a quarter of the season gone.
The Doctor also has further interaction with the Time Lords plus the story was notoriously deemed too scary for its young viewers (not by the kids, of course, but by media and 'family values' watchdogs.)  Policemen turn out to be Autons, Auton flowers shoot gas, and a little rubber devil comes to life and kills people. Good stuff.
This may be the finest story of the Pertwee era, or at least among the top 5.
Finally on DVD.  Buy it!",1300233600,6,878,4.7631578947368425
670743,5,6303482643,"Not as good as ""The Claws of Axos"", but it sure does make a good story and a worthy sequel to ""Spearhead from Space"". The Nestenes and their Auton soilders made their first appearnce alongside Jon Pertwee's Doctor at the beginning of last season, and were a hit. Now they return in this season with a new enemy for the Doctor to face - the Master!

Roger Delgado's performance of the renegade Time Lord is brilliant, and he is no doubt the best Master of them all. The Autons make a fightening reappearance as they once again try to take over Earth with the aid of the Master. UNIT member Captain Yates makes his first appearance in this story and was great, and as for the Doctor's new assissant, Jo Grant, she didn't make the best premiere of them all, but she no doubt made a great new companion as later stories will show. The story has a lot of suspenseful and eerie moments with some nice action scenes and Barry Letts' directing is brilliant - to bad he liked to use so much bad CSO effects though. The story itself is great and lots of fun to watch. ""Dr. Who"" writer Robert Holmes has done it again. Highly recommended!",1238976000,5,1127,4.366666666666666
670744,5,6303482643,"If only Mao knew!
Combining a ride of almost Magical Mystery Tour proportions this third Doctor adventure combines the evil Master with the Nestenes to produce another action packed thriller.
Whereas the first Auton adventure made us look twice at dummies, I mean mannequins, in this story the plastic combining Nestene conciousness develops a whole new series of lines, including telephone cables, daffodils and oversized masks.
The Doctor and Jo and the irrascible Master provide an action packed adventure story which grabs the attention throughout. The plot is strong with few of the flaws which characterise a number of the Pertwee episodes and there is a sort of surreal side too which prompts the comparison with Magical Mystery Tour. The notion of the flowers that kill with their lethal plastic projectile to suffocate their victims is not that far fetched an idea especially in view of the assasination of the official in London by an assailant armed with a poisoned tipped umbrella.
This must be a strong condidate for transfer to DVD soon.
One of Pertwee's best.",1034121600,,1074,5.073446327683616
670745,5,6303482643,"I am the Reviewer, and you will read this.  You will read this... you will read this...
One year after the events of Spearhead From Space, the Doctor has to deal with the Autons again, because a surviving Nestene energy unit that the Brigadier loaned to a museum has been stolen by his arch-enemy, the Master.  The Master, a Time Lord like the Doctor, plans to use the globe and a radio telescope to broadcast a signal to invite the Nestenes to victory where they failed before.  He also commandeers a plastics factory run by the weak-minded Rex Farrell.  Anyone whom he can't hypnotize, he dispatches in ruthless ways, as he does with Mr. McDermott and Mr. Farrell's father.  The Doctor, meanwhile, gets a new assistant, the clumsy but adorable Jo Grant, and is drawn into the crisis upon hearing of a raid on a radio telescope research center.  Thus begins the opening story of Season Eight, Terror Of The Autons, a classic of classics.
The scene of a Time Lord in a suit, bowler hat, and brolley appearing in mid-air with the noise of a materializing TARDIS borders on the surreal.  He and the Doctor trade barbs, but the newcomer is here to warn him about the Master.
Katy Manning, as the cute, blonde, clumsy, and kooky Jo Grant, made her debut here and she's one of the reasons why the Pertwee era is my favorite in the series' history.  The miniskirts would come much later, but this is a taste of this season and the ninth and tenth seasons.  She accidentally ruins one of his experiments, and the Doctor, who calls her a ""hamfisted bun vendor,"" for that mistake, demands that the Brigadier get rid of her.  Jo proves herself worthy by procuring some much-needed parts for him.  She eventually becomes one of his longest serving and most beloved assistants.
Roger Delgado is a suave villain and throughout his appearances, I found it hard to hate him.  He was charming unlike Anthony Ainley's slimey and odious rendition.  Pity he came out in only eight stories and died in a tragic car accident in 1973, thus barring any possible returns to Who.
The troll doll, which raised the ire of viewers, is an ugly thing, which makes it all the more menacing as it stalks the elder Mr. Farrell.  The scene of fake policemen (Autons) ordered by the Master to kill the Master and Jo also got angry complaints from Scotland Yard.  Gosh, how I love controversial programs, and those that portray policeman (even fake ones), as villains.  Yes, I'm still judge the police over the Rodney King, Malice Green, and Amadou Diallo incidents.
It's interesting how our overwhelming dependence on plastic was made plainly clear, and how we'd be in a death trap if anything plastic could come to life and kill us.  Strangled by my headphones, impaled by a flying CD,... and I hate to think what the toilet seat would do.
This is also the second of three stories whose colour episodes were lost and had to be recreated using a black and white PAL, a colour NTSC version, and synchronizing the two.  The video has a film-like quality as a result, and gives it a nostalgic 70's look.
One of my favorite Who stories of all time, not only because of the return of the Autons, but the debut of Katy Manning as Jo Grant and Roger Delgado as the Master.  Richard Franklin also makes his debut as Captain Mike Yates and a possible love interest for Jo, a concept that was never realized.  And the late Michael Wisher, best known as Davros, makes his Who debut in this story.

670746,4,6303482643,"This Jon Pertwee tale has a notorious reputation - it is the story that brought Dr Who its first big controversy. Depicting murderous policemen, dolls and daffodils, it sparked outcry, outrage and was even discussed in parliament. Oh, how it was corrupting the kiddies of Britain! They would be too scared of going to bed with their teddy bears or approaching a police officer! Cue Mary Whitehouse, who would later bring forth her tirades against the evil, godless programme, crusading as an ambassador for all that's good and nice. (Mrs Whitehouse always brings out this reviewer's sarcastic side!) Today such a story would not raise a single eyebrow - it really shouldn't have way back in 1971. It wasn't until the 1980s that violence became a real problem for Dr Who - the Jon Pertwee era is in fact one of the most ""cleanest"" periods of the show when it came to violence - death was always bloodless, ""laser gun"" style. However, I will concede that ""Terror of the Autons"" DOES has disturbing images. The idea of daffodils coming alive and suffocating people is one of them. One of the story's most memorable and vivid scenes is when McDermott is slowly smothered by the plastic chair. The Autons walking about in their freakish carnival masks is another. However, this is a credit to Robert Holmes, one of the series' best writers. For isn't that the purpose of science fiction? To stretch our imaginations and present outlandish scenarios? They may be disturbing, but they leave an impact on the viewer. That is what ""Terror of the Autons"" achieves overall. The story is basically a sequel to the excellent ""Spearhead From Space"", the first Nestene/Auton story. It is basically the same story told again; it is not terribly original, and in my opinion inferior to its prequel, but is told on a grander scale. It introduces the ""UNIT family"", with assistant Jo Grant, UNIT officer Mike Yates and the Master all making their first appearances. While ""Spearhead From Space"" was basically a horror tale, with a cold, creepy feel to it; ""Terror of the Autons"" is an action oriented remake. It has terrific moments, some great suspenseful scenes and quiet linking moments that in no way slow down the story. It also brings out more of the childishness and arrogance of Jon Pertwee's Doctor (his verbal tirade against the civil servant Brownrose is so uncharacteristic of the Doctor as we have known him). A few complaints: the CSO effects look truly awful (especially inside the Farrels' kitchen); the solution is rushed and a bit too convenient. However, it is an extremely pacy, fast moving story. It's not as good as the first Auton story and lacks originality, but it has its moments that make it an enjoyable story in its own right.",970272000,14,2736,4.823404255319149

UNIT is fleshed out a bit more with Mike Yates being brought in and Jo Grant is introduced as the new assistant. The big reason this is better is that Roger Delgado is introduced as the Master.
