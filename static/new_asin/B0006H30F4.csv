2184021,3,B0006H30F4,"St. Marie-La-Mauderne, a small fishing village near Quebec, has fallen on hard times. The locals, including Germaine (Raymond Bouchard) collect their welfare checks from the post office and promptly cash them at the bank every month, proceeding from one to the other like prisoners going to the exercise yard. A company is considering the small town for a new factory, which would give the town an enormous boost, both morally and financially. The one catch is that there is no full-time doctor in residence; the company's insurance policy requires this. Germaine and his friends go about recruiting a doctor. Soon, Dr. Christopher Lewis (David Boutin) arrives, for a month trial. The townsfolk tap his phone and try to make sure that he has everything he could ever want. During the month, he also eyes the only single woman in the entire town, the post mistress. Will he be convinced to stay in the town?

""Seducing Dr. Lewis"", a French Canadian film, is a charming little film, much like ""Waking Ned Devine"" or ""Local Hero"". The film depicts the lives of the people in this small town, making them believable and eccentric.

""Seducing"" doesn't break any new ground, what it does is provide a sweet, sometimes funny little slice of life. As we are introduced to the characters and the town, we learn what life in St. Marie-La-Mauderne was like in the good old days, when fishing was lucrative. This is a funny segment and easily sets the tone for the remainder of the film. In present day, the town has fallen on hard times. Many of the people stay because this is what their entire lives have been. When things become so bad, some people start to move or threaten to move. The offer of a new factory is made and the town works towards that.

The arrival of Dr. Lewis isn't an entirely voluntary one. Many doctors receive the notices from the town and laughingly throw them away. Dr. Lewis is ""encouraged"" to visit the town and initially scoffs at the small town. As he learns that the restaurant serves Beef Bourguignon and the town plays Cricket, two of his favorite things, he starts to warm to them. Of course, both of these things are lies and the townspeople are merely putting on a show.

The film throws in a couple of complications along the way, to keep things interesting. The company building the town needs a certain number of people living in the vicinity, to adequately staff the facility. When company officials visit, Germain gives them a tour, following the townspeople from one location to the other, giving the appearance of a lot more people.

The outcome of the film is predictable, perhaps, but it is also good-natured. I know of a few people who will not go to violent films. They want to see happy films about people. Well, ""Seducing Dr. Lewis"" is for you. It is the perfect rental for a night in, after a tough week at work. Get some French take out and enjoy a visit to a sleepy little fishing village called St. Marie-La-Mauderne.",1111536000,5,2960,4.673704414587332

2184023,4,B0006H30F4,"Set in a village on a small island in Quebec, this charming story belongs to a genre of whimsical films that are usually set in Ireland or Scotland -- about a quaint and remote village's relationship with the more urban, modern world.  These movies typically emphasize the beauty of the area and the shrewdness of the villagers, and this movie is no exception.  The villagers have been living on welfare for 8 years (the fish are gone) and desperately want the respectability of paychecks -- and there's hope of attracting a factory to the town -- but they would need a doctor in the town to get a factory.  So -- they set about to attract a doctor.  They manage to get a doctor to spend a month there (not willingly -- he's forced to live there for a month to avoid a DUI conviction) and from the beginning, are determined to make him love the village so much that he'll stay.  They'll do anything to land this big fish, and that's where the comedy comes in.  This big-city surgeon is no match for the machinations of these conspiring fishermen.

This film is predictable but charming. The seaside fishing village scenery makes you want to pack your suitcase so you can see it for yourself. It's a pleasant evening's entertainment but light.

2184024,3,B0006H30F4,"What will a village go through to get back their dignity is the question this film poses.  And in this case, the answer is quite a bit.

St. Marie La Mauderne has seen better days.  The town's main employment, fishing, has gone the way of the dinosaur, and most of the once-proud citizens have been on welfare for several years.  Enter the prospect of a factory which would employ all who wished to work, but there's a catch:  they require a doctor in residence.  It seems like a hopeless situation, but then the citizenry get lucky--a Montreal doctor has an altercation with a cop who turns out to be the former mayor of St. Marie, and a month-long stay is negotiated.  It is then up to the villagers to make the young doctor want to stay, and so begins their seduction of Dr. Lewis using, among other things, cricket, a tapped phone, and beef stroganoff.

In a way, it reminds me of Doc Hollywood, the late '80's film starring Michael J. Fox, who is forced to practice medicine in a small town after a car accident, but in this film the town pretends it is something it is not in order to woo him into staying.

I very much enjoyed this movie, despite my growing indignation as the film went on of the town's emotional manipulation of the doctor, who turns out to be kind of goofy and sweet.  All is worked out in the end, thankfully, and the end is a satisfying and happy one.  A very charming film...",1106956800,,1404,4.361538461538461

This Audience Award Winner from the 2003 Sundance Festival is the most refreshing film that I have seen in a while. Cut very much in the mold of earlier British comedies such as AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL AND CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN,SAVING GRACE,THE FULL MONTY and VERY ANNIE MARY,Montreal -based film director Jean-Francois Pouliot (THE LITTLE BOOK OF REVENGE also with the same screen writer Ken Scott of MAURICE RICHARD fame), SEDUCING DR.LEWIS (Le Grand Seduction)takes us into the small fishing village of Mt. Marie-Le-Mauderne at a wild and desperate peek at the 120 inhabitants of this tiny hamlet. Simply put,the town is going under and in order to get a plastics factory to come to their little island they must procure the services of a full time Doctor. They know that their village offers nothing for someone from the ""big city"" of Montreal three hours away,so the villagers set about to ""gild the lily"" as it were to reinvent their town to attract a physician in the most ingenious,unconventional and comical of ways. Drug busted Dr. Christopher Lewis (David Boutin of HOCKELAGA and BLACK EYED DOG) all of a sudden finds himself on a small ferry en route to the tiny island. He is modern,loves hockey,fusion jazz and comfortability,and St. Marie will go to any crazy costs to give him what he wants (or this case, thinks he needs!).Will this pack of lies and deceptions that Mt. Marie's citizens work, or will they all be exposed? You really need to see this film to believe it. It is uproariously funny and clever if not slightly formulaic and sappy;but then again it did win over an entire Sundance audience as it did me. Well worth the price on DVD or VHS.
The film is beautifully shot,edited with a gorgeous and appropriately winning soundtrack by Jean-Marie Benoit(JESUS OF MONTREAL).
This is to also encourage viewers to delve into the world of films from Montreal,Quebec,Canada. They are a wonderfully refreshing

Synopsis: With the departure of the once plentiful fishing livelihood the quaint island township of St-Marie-La Mauderne is now on the verge of extinction. Their only chance for survival is to convince a plastic company to build a factory on their island that would provide jobs and self-esteem to a community on welfare. However there are two major obstacles they must first overcome if they have any hope of attracting big business;

1- They must have a population of at least 210 residents and
2- The must have a full-time Doctor living and practicing on the island.

Those are definitely problems since they have a population of only 110 people. Now attracting a doctor, that's a problem they might be able to do something about. This film tells the story about how they went about saving their way of life.

Critique: Released in '02 the lighthearted film `Seducing Dr. Lewis' (La Grande Seduction) is what I like to think of as Quebec's answer to `Waking Ned Devine'. While this French Canadian film is not as quirky or imaginative as the '98 British comedy set in a rural Irish community it does possess a quiet charm all its own, creating an engaging, likeable cast of characters that should sufficiently charm the audience for the duration of the film.

2184056,3,B0006H30F4,"""Seducing Dr. Lewis"" (2002) is a French Canadian film that I enjoyed, and that is likely to please the spectator that simply wants to be entertained. From my point of view, this is a funny albeit somewhat predictable film, that will make you laugh but that won't surprise you.

The story takes place in a remote and very small village, St. Marie-La-Mauderne, where people cannot find work and must ask for welfare checks. That makes them extremely sad, almost gloomy, because for them a job means dignity, and that is something they don't think they have.

Thanksfully, hope appears for the citizens of St. Marie-La-Mauderne in the form of a project to build a factory. Unfortunately, there is a condition they will need to fulfill, as the factory will only be built if they can find a doctor that wants to live in their town.

Of course, when chance brings Dr. Lewis to their little town for a short sjour, the citizens of St. Marie-La-Mauderne are extremely happy, and prepared to do everything to make him realize that their town is an ideal place to live. How far will they go? Well, just rent this dvd and watch. It won't be boring :)

2184058,4,B0006H30F4,"**Being a current student of French studying Quebecois culture, I chose to write this review in French, for the Francophones who may feel a little left out on the critique of one of their own movies.**

 La Grande Sduction  est une grande comdie qubcoise qu'on doit voir bientt. La ville Sainte Marie La Moderne dans le nord du Qubec tait en ruines, avec tout le monde en scurit sociale et en chmage. Mais le maire de la ville, Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard) a de l'espoir pour leur ville. Il veut qu'une fabrique vienne pour donner du travail et les negotions encore un fois. Mais pour cela d'arriver, on a besoin d'un docteur pour le peuple. Quand un jeune homme, le Docteur Lewis (David Boutin) crit qu'il arrive pour voir la ville, les gens font une grande opration pour lui plaisir. Ils ont change toute la ville pour tre ce qu'il aime, et le docteur vraiment commence d'aimer la belle ville marinire. A la fin, le jeune docteur compte rendu de ce que tout est une mensonge- mais avec les meilleures intentions. Il dcide de vivre dans la ville et travailler comme leur docteur. C'est vraiment une bonne fin.

 Ce film est gnial pour beaucoup de raisons, la premire est le choix des acteurs. Ils dmontrent physiquement les diffrences culturelles entre les rgions du mme pays. Le jeune docteur Smith est de la grande ville, Montral, et il a beaucoup de savoir faire et il ne sait rien de la vie rurale. Il est beau et les choses matrielles sont importantes pour lui, au dpart. A l'autre cot sont les gens de la Sainte Marie, surtout Germain et Yvon (Pierre Collin), qui ont les visages de ceux qui ont travail pour beaucoup d'ans. Ils sont durs de constitution et de mots, avec beaucoup de rides, et ils ne savent rien de la vie urbaine. Les deux cots des hommes sont  la mme fois nave de la vie de l'autre.

  L'interprtation faite pour les acteurs tait trs bonne aussi, parce qu'ils sont les acteurs qubcois trs connus. Bien sur, l'utilisation d'une ville rel dans le nord du Qubec a donne au film une sentiment de la familiarit et ralit- ce n'est pas une scne cre pour Hollywood. Les gens de la ville peuvent tre les gens de n'importe pas ville; parce que toujours la famille, le travail, et le bonheur sont les choses le plus importantes. C'est trs important que ce film a les acteurs vraiment qubcois, parce qu'ils ont besoin de reprsentation dans le monde cinmatique. Petit  petit, avec les films russis pour tout le monde comme ce film ci, le Qubec toujours accumule le respect qu'elle mrite.

 La musique est une composante essentielle de chaque film, qui peut donner une certaine motion au lecteur. La bande sonore de La Grande Sduction est une belle mlange des motions qui incluent la tristesse, le bonheur, la fte, et le rflexion, tout a travers du ton, du son et du rythme de la musique. Jean-Marie Benot, le compositeur, nous donne le sentiment de vivre dans cette petite ville qui est rustique et calme, et aussi nous donne le sens de la vie urbaine de Montral, qui est compltement le contraire.

 Ce film n'est pas une histoire originale, mais c'est une comdie propre que toute la famille peut apprcier. Les personnages sont trs connus et semblables de nous-mmes, de chaque personnage qui apparat dans la vie actuelle. La bande sonore est le parfait fonde pour un voyage au nord du Qubec. Et les rles jous pour les acteurs sont gniaux et amusants  la fois. On veut voir ce film pour rire et pour voir un peu de la vie qubcoise qu'est normalement cache.",1149206400,7,3473,4.5880452342487885
2184059,5,B0006H30F4,"SEDUCING DR LEWIS by Jean-Franois Pouliot

 The Brits love French films when the French show their shortcomings or their typical way of tackling a problem they have created. There is more than that in this film. French Canada: a tiny, isolated, impoverished but VERY happy village far from the madding crowd and limited by the ocean. They were promised a factory if they have a doctor. (I won't say who's doing his job!). Unfortunately, no doctors fancy moving there despite their desperate attempts. Then Destiny chose poor young Dr Lewis to be sent, shall I say sentenced for a year in the happy village. The population will stop at nothing to make him happy enough to want to stay. For them the end justifies the means. As they find out -in an unorthodox way- that Dr Lewis is a fan of cricket, they decide to learn it thanks to the unique computer of the village. And they will make a lot more sacrifices and concessions.

Five reasons to watch this film:

Funny from beginning to end

French countrymen learning the esoteric rules of cricket.

Bribes reaching remote corners

People determined to save their home with a ruthless solidarity

A story to relieve stress and make your morbid view of humanity change in minutes.",1142899200,,1228,4.732394366197183
2184060,5,B0006H30F4,"The hero of this film is a small town in Quebec that has aged badly.  The fishing industry is dead, and there has been no other work to take its place.  The men of the town trudge through their days complacently, having resigned themselves to accept welfare checks from the government at expense to their manhood.  Even the mayor is leaving town for a better life elsewhere.  Just about everyone in the town has given up on it.

There is, however, a way out: a large company is going to build a factory there, and thus give meaning and life to the zombie-like male population.  However, there is also a very difficult condition: the town must first hire a full-time physician.

And so, the town cooperates to seduce a doctor to making this blighted town (that is yet paradoxically beautiful in its imperfections) his desire.

So, this movie is a very interesting twist on the romantic comedy.  On the first hand, it is a man who is the object of a seduction.  Secondly, it is a village that is doing the seduction, and coping as its plans topple comically out-of-control.

The players in the seduction are wonderfully un-suave and salty, and their efforts are all the more earnest for it.

PS  I should admit that title of this review is misleading in one small way: there is a very attractive actress in the film (Lucie Laurier, ""Eve"").  However, her character is refreshingly not involved in the seduction at all.",1133654400,8,1415,4.6305220883534135
2184061,3,B0006H30F4,"'Seducing Dr. Lewis' is a quirky little film from Canada, the country which have produced many quirky little films.  But the film is a comedy, enjoyable if predictable and overlong, and should be recommended to those who love the films like 'Waking Ned Devine.'

Like 'Ned,' the film is about a small community, fictional St.-Marie-La-Mauderne in Quebec Canada, and the residents who must keep on lying to 'seduce Dr. Lewis.'  This small island has only 125 people, and is seeing a gradual but steady economic depression.  In short, they need more jobs.

Fortunately, there is a plan of building a new factory in this village.  Unfortunately, however, they need a doctor as full-time resident for the plan to materialize.  So what should they do?

The answer is 'Seducing Dr. Lewis.'  When young doctor Christopher Lewis arrives from the mainland, the villagers join forces to provide whatever he likes without his knowing.  If they know -- in fact they spy -- that Lewis loves cricket, they not only form cricket teams of their own, but fakes a 'the final' of 'the annual competition' to show how the villagers love this sport.  Even if they don't know even how to play.

[CHARMING CHARACTERS] Honestly, Dr. Lewis (David Boutin) is not as charming as the lovely villagers.  Actually, all the funny part comes from these charming people all played by Canadian actors especially Raymond Bouchard who outshines everyone else as the stubborn leader of the 'seduction' plan.  Like his character, the film is full of good-natured feelings.

However, for all the praises (at Sundance, for instance), I for one didn't like some part of it.  The predictable nature of the film can be easily ignored, but as I said before, the young doctor is a rather dull character.  And if the villagers are so nice people -- and actually they all are -- you just don't need this contrived plan to convince the doctor that it's nice to live in this beautiful island.

Another regrettable thing is that some characters are clearly wasted.  When you see beautiful Lucie Laurier as Eve, who distances herself from the fuss and watches Dr. Lewis with doubtful eyes, you expect something might happen between them.  Sorry, but not much.  Some may call it subdued direction.  I wanted to think so, but after seeing the film spend too much time in showing unnecessary elements like Dr. Lewis's girlfriend, I think that's only a flaw and the first-time director Jean-Franois Pouliot is to be blamed.

For all its flaws, 'Seducing Dr. Lewis' is a charming comedy.  And the charms are mainly from the charming villagers played by talented Canadian actors.  And the landscape of the village.",1125014400,,2657,4.890380313199105

Given the troublesome world we have today, so full of violence, greed and sadness, just slipping this disk in and running it lightens the heart. Even the fact that it is in French with English subtitles doesn't deter it's charm for one moment. The shenanigans this little clan of islanders off the coast of Canada use to lure and retain the doctor needed, before a factory will come to the island and provide work and wages are hysterical, bringing tears of laughter to one's eyes. This is not high slapstick comedy but gentle, subtle comedy that heightens the sentimental and tender story of a group of proud working class humans efforts to once again become productive citizens of society after circumstances have demoralized and humiliated them by forcing them onto the welfare rolls. Not a flick for those seeking high thrills and action but for those needing a good laugh, a lightening of heart, and a peek, just for a moment, of life that is still communal and holds out hope.",1122076800,9,1117,4.618090452261306

This movie takes place on an island once supported by its fishing industry, but now desperately in need of another means of maintaining its existence. The islanders must cope with this challenge, and to do so, they try to trick a big-city doctor into setting up a practice on the island.

There are many laugh-out-loud moments, especially the cricket game and when the villagers run from one building to another to try to convince the doctor that the population is larger than it really is.

Following the precedent of ""Doc Hollywood"" and ""Northern Exposure,"" the film highlights the attractive simplicity of small town life and makes it almost as irresistible to the audience as it supposed to be to Doctor Lewis.  The film has a couple small, but glaring, conceptual similarities to its predecessors: 1) as in ""Doc Hollywood,"" the doctor is a plastic surgeon--i.e. just the sort of person who needs an adorable small town to straighten out his priorities, and 2) as in ""Northern Exposure"" the doctor is looking at a limited, 5-year stint in the town, something that seems more plausible than seeing a young doctor dedicating his entire future career to a town of just over 100 people.  All in all, ""Seducing Doctor Lewis"" is the seductive little film it sets out to be, nearly mustering a charm equal to ""Waking Ned Divine.""  And one has to admire the filmmakers for sidestepping the potential cliches that the film's ending could have stooped to.  David Boutin, also, plays a very likable doctor, while looking strangely like a Dominique Pinon whose body has been stretched to leading-man proportions.",1117238400,,1375,4.935064935064935

The actor who plays the protagonist reminded me of Topal (as Tevya in ""Fiddler on the Roof"") or Phillipe Noiret in ""Cinema Paradiso"" and the brilliantly funny ""Les Ripoux (My New Partner)"".  It's a movie guaranteed to make you laugh out loud several times and to leave you smiling at the end.  A very charming Seduction.  Be advised:  It's in French, with optional English sub-titles, but well worth watching despite the ""inconvenience"" of the sub-titles.",1346976000,,1073,5.056818181818182

Since I live on a small island that is primarily a lobstering community, I thought I might like it.  I ended up laughing outloud but don't think I would have had I read a review of it.  Timing and not knowing what's coming next can make a book or a film.",1287964800,,358,3.810810810810811
8041601,5,B0006H30F4,"This 2003 film, Seducing Dr. Lewis,  is a fun and quirky French film about a small Canadian village of about 120 people in St.-Marie-La-Mauderne where fishing isn't good, and the folks line up to receive their welfare checks where the money lasts 2 weeks and the shame lasts a month.

A company wants to build a factory here, and a requirement is the town must have 200 people and a doctor, which they don't have either.  So, in order to lure a doctor with a committment to sign and stay on, the townspeople band together to play along with the deceptive schemes, including tapping his phone to find out as much as possible.  The doctor arrives to discover some oddball things going on.  One deception is that the town has a cricket team; and they know absolutely nothing about cricket, but it is hilarious as they attempt to construct a game in view of the arriving doctor.  Since the fishing is poor, they place frozen fish in the sea so the doctor can catch something.

This is a fun and a feel-good comedy, it is not stupid, but clever writing, crazy plot, memorable characters and overall a quirky storyline.  There are beautiful views of the sea, the sky and the quaint village itself.  This is a clean movie with no offensive language, nor situations.  Director Jean-Francois Pouliot has been a successful director of film and television commercials.  See this! ......Rizzo",1282089600,,1380,4.708333333333333
