8139786,4,B000HIP4HY,The dvds were shipped fast but License to drive had a scratch on it which is the only reason I bought this set. It still played ok so I kept it. Over all this was a good buy.,1268179200,,174,3.6052631578947367
8139787,4,B000HIP4HY,"The best of these 3 movies is License To Drive,very funny and very 80's. Then the second one is Mischief with a well done back to the 50's. But Moving Violations is the very worst of all,I did not laugh once. Nothing can be perfect. But the low cost of this 3 pack DVD,was worth it anyway.",1183420800,,289,4.087719298245614
