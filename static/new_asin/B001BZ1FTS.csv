8285297,5,B001BZ1FTS,"Most of the videos contained in this collection were in heavy rotation on MTV back in the 80's, but they are much better than the garden variety music videos. There aren't any blonde bimbos in revealing costumes, or mountain top/cliff side guitar solos, the Kinks are far too witty to indulge in such rock and roll cliches. Julien Temple directed all the conceptual clips, they're really like mini-movies. ""Come Dancing"" is my favorite rock video ever - the lyrics are really like a script for the song, so all the Kinks have to do is act it out. ""Don't Forget to Dance"" is sort of like the sequal, both videos feature Ray Davies' 'spiv' character (who also reappears in ""Do it Again""). ""State of Confusion"" is the funniest one of the bunch, one 4-minute long tribute to Ray's klutziness (the expression on bassist Jim Rodford's face in one scene is priceless). The live clips are all taken from the band's ""One for the Road"" video, which is a must have for any fans of the band. Once again, I'm reminded of the guitar mastery of Dave Davies, and the incredible energy level these guys displayed in their concert appearances. It's too bad there isn't a similar video collection from the Kinks' MCA years, but this is an excellent summary of their very successful Arista output.",1244160000,2,1277,4.68
