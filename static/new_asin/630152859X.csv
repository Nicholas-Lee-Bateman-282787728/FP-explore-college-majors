341611,5,630152859X,"A must buy for all history buffs especially telegraph buffs! I'm elated to have a copy of Western Union in my movie collection. The movie is about how Western Union set up telegraph poles across the United States to the west coast. Showing all the struggle, killing of people, all in the effort to set up communications across the nation. At the end of the movie it showed how wonderful it was to have communications from east to west. This was the beginning of what was later to become telephone communications!

341612,4,630152859X,"It might seem strange that Fritz Lang would make a western, since his forte was clearly the crime film, but then you remember that his first American film, ""Fury,"" was about a lynching and you realize that the Old West has long been an ideal location for playing out the major themes of the American identity.  ""Western Union"" is the story of the first trans-continental telegraph line being strung across the west, which represents the director's interest in modern technology, although clearly this is retrospective in the same way that ""Metropolis"" was futuristic.  Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is fleeing a posse and when his goes lame he ends up with Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), a telegraph engineer who hires the outlaw as a scout.  Richard Blake (Robert Young) is a surveyor who arrives from the east and takes a spark to Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore), the sister of Edward, which sets up the film's love triangle.  Meanwhile, Confederate raiders led by Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) are stealing cattle and disrupting the building of the telegraph line.  Shaw is caught in the middle of this as well because he has a relationship with Slade.

Because this is a Fritz Lang film ""Western Union"" does not play out the way you think in terms of who gets the girl and who kills who in the big gunfight at the end.  Shaw is trying to reform and his efforts are contrasted with those of the raiders, who call themselves Confederates but are clearly more interested in profiting from their actions.  Shaw was one of  Quantrill's raiders and we understand that was a legitimate guerilla group unlike the one headed by Slade.  Despite being handicapped because he has come from the East and likes to wear nice clothes, the character of Blake emerges as a hero as well (we can tell because he starts dressing like a cowboy), which is certainly something of a surprise.  For that matter, Sue Creighton is more than widow dressing in the film, because she is also a telegraph operator and is as excited about the building of the telegraph as anyone.  Still, the big picture of the telegraph becomes secondary to Shaw's personal struggle.

This was Lang's second color film and the director takes advantage of the setting to offer up some great shots of the beautiful landscapes filmed by Edward Cronjager.  The flaw in ""Western Union"" are the comic episodes, which really cut against the grain of the film.  You have Chill Willis as Homer Kettle and Slim Summerville as Cookie (the cook) who is always scared witless by the Wild West, providing the unnecessary comic relief and John Carradine bringing his distinctive touch to the role of Doc Murdoch.  This is one of Scott's better roles and better performances, and given the stakes involved from his perspective the humor is at least misplaced if not forced.  Jagger was always a solid character actor and even Young manages to do something with the strictures of his character.

""Western Union"" was Lang's second Western, the first being ""The Return of Frank James,"" which better fits the traditional Lang mold.  You cannot tell the story of how the ""singing wire"" was strung from Omaha to Salt Lake City and just focus on the technological accomplishment so the dilemmas faced by Shaw become the real driving force of the narrative.  The 1941 film was a personal favorite of Lang's and the director took pride in photographing Native Americans wearing accurate warpaint and battle gear.  Lang made one more western, ""Rancho Notorious,"" and if there is a clear commonality to this trio of westerns made by a master director who immigrated from Germany, it would be the theme of a man ruled by fate.  However, in ""Western Union"" it would seem that fate wins.  Final Note: I have never managed to spot him, but Jay Silverheels (a.k.a. Tonto from ""The Lone Ranger"") is an uncredited extra in this film.",1097280000,12,3852,4.820668693009119

341667,5,630152859X,"WESTERN UNION, though not unknown, has been underrated since its release.
1- Some have snickered at the Hollywoodization of Fritz Lang in doing a Western. But Lang was associated with Joe May before rocketing  to fame and the early post-WWI German mania for Westerns reminds one of the Italian Spaghetti Western craze in the 60s-70s.
2- Lang gets an iconic, groundbreaking performance from the stoic Randolph Scott. This is arguably the first ""A"" Western depicting ""The Man With A Past,"" foreshadowing such as SHANE, MAN OF THE WEST, THE SEARCHERS, THE GUNFIGHTER, THE HANGING TREE, etc. There is an adult undercurrent, different than but related to STAGECOACH and the classic, underappreciated THE WESTERNER. Further, the Cain/Abel narrative core (Shaw/Slade) was w/o precedent in serious Westerns.
3- This is a genuine Technicolor epic, sparing no expense yet preserving a central dramatic, emotional core w/o, say, major stars who carried, say, DeMille's preceding B/W Western epics THE PLAINSMAN and UNION PACIFIC. The DeMilles are great but unserious. Here, the actors are compelling and unlike DeMille, Lang isn't the true star. Unlike DeMille, too, the script is narrative- and character-driven. Of course a Technicolor and B/W movie can't really be compared but it's harder to retain dramatic impact in Color than B/W.
4- WESTERN UNION is, then, a classic -- action-filled, BIG and romantic. And tragic. Tragic is good.",1461456000,,1427,5.314159292035399

Image quality. Very fine. Probably the best we're going get of this 1941 Technicolor classic without a full-scale restoration of the original elements. And it deserves a Robert A. Harris treatment. Film grain is evident which is a good sign.

Audio quality. Very good. The mono track is clear and clean and the dialog never gets buried in the mix.

Extras. A nicely done collection of promotional film stills.

Languages. German, English. No subtitles -- gosh darn it.

341684,5,630152859X,"A fabulous and opulent western directed by Fritz Lang, based on a Zane Grey novel, and starring Robert Young as Richard Blake, Randolph Scott as Vance Shaw, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore as Edward & Sue Creighton along with a cast of tried & true character actors that reads like a ""Who's Who"" list straight out of 5 Star Casting.  Even the Indians include two of the most famous of them all, ""Iron Eyes"" Cody & Jay Silverheels plus Chief Thundercloud and Chief John Big Tree for good measure!  There are no bad or half hearted performances in this sprawling tale of the kind of men it took to get those poles into the ground and the ""Singing Wire"" up so that Western Union could follow the movement through the heartland and to our western shores. In the face of Indian uprisings, double dealing and threats by those who would sabotage the progress of Western Union for personal gain, many lives were forfeit.  Backed by a lively love triangle involving our Blake, Shaw and Miss Creighton, her brother, Edward, tries desperately to get and keep up those all important wires through Indian territory.

Vance Shaw is a former Confederate soldier whose way of life has become that of an outlaw involved in a gang which includes his brother, Jack Slade!  Slade, played by the quintessential bad-guy we all love to hate, Barton MacLane. While racing across the plains, trying to escape capture by a posse that is after him, Vance Shaw finds Creighton lying injured on the trail. With several broken ribs, Creighton is unable to ride as he is and Shaw is just about to steal his horse, leaving him stranded when Creighton makes him an offer to help him back to town!  Vance Shaw makes the decision of his life when he says yes to this offer.  Shaw happens to speak the tongue of the Sioux and Creighton needs help with the Indians who keep raiding his horse stockyards and attacking his crews.  He offers Shaw a job and he is subsequently introduced to Sue Creighton, Edward's beautiful sister, who is also being eyed by Richard Blake, the very green, tenderfoot engineer from back east who has also been hired to help Western Union.  Vance Shaw is doing very well in his new job, is happily involved with Sue Creighton and is a great help to Edward with his knowledge of the territory.  He has come to rely, heavily, on Shaw but something happens that neither he nor Shaw is expecting involving the Indians, Shaw's brother and Western Union that will lead to tragedy and a showdown between brothers.  I'll leave it right there so you can see for yourselves hat happens here.  It is an exciting and well crafted film and I can but highly recommend it since it really is a must have film in this genre.",1422230400,3,2699,4.588357588357589

341686,4,630152859X,"I'd give it four and half stars. I grew up on Randolph Scott westerns and still am a fan. Generally rode the most beautiful dark palomino horse that to that point, I had ever seen. But Scott was always ramrod straight, spoke little, and behaved admirably. He represented the quintessential western hero. This movie reaches way back, to when Scott was not as type cast, and played a bad guy, or at least a guy with less than a stellar past, who tries to go straight. He's not the sole star, sharing with Robert Young and Dean Jagger (with hair) , but to my mind Scott's character that's most interesting in the film.  It's a colorful and pretty fun outing with Hollywood Indians battling the wire being strung across their land. Then there's Scott's former gang who wants to plunder and steal from the wire stringing crew. For the western film collector, it's a must have. Highly recommend.",1419120000,2,889,4.6265822784810124

341721,4,630152859X,"WESTERN UNION (released 1941) (reviewed 2014)

Time was when a Hollywood film had a shelf life of nine months. Thats how long it took a film title to work its way down the food chain from first-run release to your lowly neighborhood theater.

Not a single Hollywood functionary in the 1930s and `40s thought in terms of posterity. Oh sure, an occasional film would be cleaned up for re-release (a money-maker like Gone With the Wind, for example). But mostly it was a matter of one and done.

Then came VHS and DVD, and todays wondrous new methods for restoring and preserving past film treasures. Which came out looking as good as theyd ever looked in theaters. And so a good film finally achieved the same level of permanence as a good book.

Enter Western Union, circa 1941. Culled from a Zane Grey novel, the 20th Century Fox film was shot in genuine Technicolor, not in the putrid shades of color so prevalent today.

Its cast features Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore, who at the time was the most beautiful maiden on the planet. Its important to list Robert Young first in the credits because this is NOT your standard Randolph Scott oater.

Western Union is character driven  unusual for a Western in any era. It has historical implications, purporting to show the challenges facing the crews that braved Indian attacks and other impediments to unite a nation with an unbroken strand of telegraph wire.

Robert Young is a tenderfoot who falls for the girl. Randy Scott is a roamer with a troubled past who falls for the girl. Dean Jagger is the girls brother striving to keep peace between them as the telegraph builders come under savage Indian attack.

Or are the attackers Indians? Someone better find out, pardner. Sounds formulaic? Its not  no more so than any film or novel whose characters come with honest human motivations.

A bonus for the discerning viewer is the vastly underrated Barton McLane as the chief skulldugger. McLane was the best villain Hollywood ever produced, and he managed it without resorting to any of the garish torture methods favored by our present-day fiends. (Does the Johnny Depp-utized Lone Ranger fiasco strike a chord?)

Randolph Scott continued to crank out oaters for 25 years. He never approached this level of plausible engagement again.

Robert Young segued over to a TV family sitcom as a kindly father who told his kids what they needed to know. This was before Google.

Virginia Gilmore might have become a household word based on her gentle wit and other attractions. Instead she married Yul Brynner. Some consolation prize.

Meanwhile Western Union lives on  gonna get that telegraph line built one of these days, pardner.

In WESTERN UNION, Edward Creighton, played by Dean Jagger, is a chief enginer for the telegarph company installing poles and wires from Omaha to Salt Lake City during the Civil War era.

Crieghton hires Vance Shaw, played by  Randolph Scott, an ex-outlaw, as what now would be known as a facilitator.  Vance enters a usually friendly rivalary with an engineer/surveyer from Harvard, Richard Blake, played by Robert Young, over the courtship of Creighton's lovely sister, Sue, played by Virgina Gilmore.
Vance and Richard also have disagreements about work related matters as well but when some genuine as well as  ersatz Indians led by Jack Slade,who as I have said, is played by  Barton McLaine, start trying to steal from and destroy the construction efforts of Western Union, all bets are off in this pretty exciting western film.

I'm not going to call WESTERN UNION a groundbreaking western but in its way, WESTERN UNION does seem to set a  new convention or two.  It has an excellent if underused cast of supporting players and, being a Fritz Lang production, is especially well photographed. And, being a Fritz Lang production, it has some of the usual Langian attributes including the somewhat  strange relationship,if you can call it that, between Vance Shaw and his outlaw brother,Jack Slade,as I have said is  played by Barton MacLain.

WESTERN UNION is well worth seeking out, just as an example of an early Technicolor western, although it is a lot more than that. I give it Four
and One Half Stars.",1284854400,11,1812,4.88562091503268

341762,5,630152859X,"Lang does Hawks as well as Hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary Western, before settling down into typical deterministic, dark and guilt-haunted fatalism for the dark finale.

This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and being pursued, we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but discovering that Creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix him up first. This is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief, clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.

Cut to a few weeks or months later, with Creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants him anyway, repaying a debt and sensing something quality. Also hired is a tenderfoot, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the Easterner Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both of the hires vie for Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of Howard Hawks' ""Red River"" or ""Only Angels Have Wings"" than most Lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter, and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual Langian themes of the haunted past, dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. Shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew, and Shaw has to wrestle with what, if anything, he is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), leader of the outlaws.

Beautifully shot in early Technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations, this is for my money easily Lang's best western and one of his very best films, conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him, showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.

My old VHS is perfectly serviceable, but this badly needs an official, quality DVD release - easily one of the best westerns of the 1940s, if not of the American cinema as a whole.",1253491200,8,3490,4.56140350877193

341764,3,630152859X,"Director Fritz Lang's attention to historic and human details play an integral role in ""Western Union""  a fictitious account of the telegraph line's evolution in the 1860s. Generally acknowledged as the first epic-scale Western in color, the 1941 Fox production is a rather conventional Hollywood endeavor. Despite the excessive comic relief and overemphasis on romance, the German filmmaker incorporates some of his fatalistic vision into the proceedings  embodied by Randolph Scott's tragic characterization. Lang's individual shadings add moments of realism to what could have been an overblown Cecil B. DeMille-type spectacle. ""Western Union"" remains an important film in its breakthrough casting of Scott, whose dark qualities would be further explored in his collaborations with director Budd Boetticher.",1248307200,6,810,5.914529914529915
