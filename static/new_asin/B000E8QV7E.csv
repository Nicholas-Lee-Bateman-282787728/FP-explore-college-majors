8502716,5,B000E8QV7E,This is Great DVD Rachel Elizabeth is on top form a pity other models are on it would have been better if DVD was an hour of of Rachel,1460678400,,134,3.6551724137931036
8502717,4,B000E8QV7E,"This is one of the best of the many, many Peach productions that I own. In fact the only two strikes against it are that there are too many breast implants among the models here (which can be a pretty big strike although not terrible in this case), and that some of the later vignettes lag a little.

Other than that, you have some scorchingly-hot turns by covergirl Rachel Elizabeth, Jamie Hammer (here credited as ""Sophia"" for some reason) and Julianna Prada (who I've never seen in another production). As far as explicitness this one ranks right up there near the top of all Peach productions, and it doesn't skimp on rear nudity at all, both of which get major applause from me. This is a quibble that many  buyers won't have but it bugs me a bit that so many of these vignettes were familiar to me already from other Peach releases--a lot of other people wouldn't know the difference because they don't own 30 or 40 of these the way that I do. (A lot of Peach releases are just compilations)

The run time is the typical one hour for Peach. Included are some trailers for other Peach releases and a neat little interview with Rachel.",1401321600,,1139,4.466346153846154
8502718,1,B000E8QV7E,If all you want to see in a video is naked women posing then this is it for you.  I felt it sucked only watched a third of it and threw it away. Not worth saving.,1258761600,,162,3.5
8502719,4,B000E8QV7E,"she is very hott and so is this dvd, the solo scenes are best the duos with other girls are nothing to write home about but the dvd is missing the alot of the pink factor that puts others ahead of this one but for a good price get it",1207785600,6,233,3.68
8502720,5,B000E8QV7E,"As I am now a veteran of Peach & its various brands and lines, I'm starting to learn which ones to get and which ones to avoid. The Peach Obsession line can vary from wild to mild, but the babes are usually hot, and seems Peach is reacting to customer feedback. The Rachel DVD is one of the better ones: its newer, good combination of favorites & fresh faces/ blondes and brunettes, really good productions values and smoking hot talent.

The ""Rachel"" is brunette cover-babe Rachel Elizabeth - I'm generally more into blondes but this coy, sexy stunner puts on a fantastic show here w/ a pretty face, great body, big boobs and a willingness to ""bare all"". She is in several solo scenes and a couple pairings and doesn't mind getting down and dirty or giving open-legged spreads that are 2-die-4.

Equally hot here is super busty wrestling/fitness babe Tylene Buck, who doesn't mind getting super-raunchy either and has a pairing here w/ Rachel that's stellar. Also of note were cute blonde Lonnie (great spreads) and busty Latina Sophia aka Jaime Hammer. A couple of other girl 2 & 3-somes (about 8-10 scenes total - very good) really make this one worth-while, and Rachel proves definitely ""qualified"" to be featured here in several scenes, in living, ""pink"" color.",1184025600,7,1266,4.776255707762557
