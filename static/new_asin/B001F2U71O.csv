3563296,5,B001F2U71O,"Ah! My Goddess! has a little bit of everything - it's cute, funny, endearing, and has pretty much all the good anime qualities you'd expect.  My only complaint is that it only ran 2 seasons - if it ran 10 it wouldn't be enough though.  Definitely worth watching.",1277337600,4,262,4.4375
3563297,4,B001F2U71O,"While the first season of Ah My Goddess! introduced you to the all the characters and their motivations, Flights of Fancy does a very good job to further flesh out these characters and introduces two new ones.  However, while the first season generally saw no direct interference with the main protaganists' relationship, the second season directly goes that route to forcefully develop said relationship.  While this works as a plot device, it does conflict with some of the clean charm and innocence that made the first season so refreshing.  Still much of the fare remains, while all the characters are further developed.  A very good follow-up to the first season.",1236124800,,668,5.045454545454546
3563298,4,B001F2U71O,"This review is for the continuation of the Ah! My Goddess (AMG) TV series, Sorezore no Tsubasa. It can be be watched without watching the previous series but it's probably best not to because all the major character introductions were handled in the first series.

AMG is your standard romantic comedy (rom-com), complete with a rather pathetic male lead and a huge amount of large breasted females around him. It has its quirks, such as supernatural elements in the way of Goddesses and demons, as well as some robots, but the main focus is on the comedy side, with the supernatural stuff often used as a means of getting more laughs out of viewers.

Keiichi, the pathetic male lead mentioned above, lives with no less than three Goddesses: Belldandy, a doormat who has no evil in her heart and would do anything for Keiichi; Urd, Belldandy's half Goddess, half demon big sister who likes wearing revealing clothes and attempting to push the lead couple closer together and Skuld, Belldandy's younger sister who wants all of her big sister to herself and is an expert at building machines. The four different personalites work well together, with Urd being my favourite by far because she comes across as the most real character and has had the most development in AMG to date.

A few weeks after finishing the first season (S1), I typed up a very short review. I commenting that, although the plot didn't really advance after the start, instead going around in a seemingly endless circle, people would walk away glad that AMG is a 'circular' series because it's so heart-warming and charming.

After finishing season 2 (S2), I'm starting to think I was incorrect. The fact that the relationship between Keiichi and Belldandy didn't advance beyond them 'sort of' confessing their love for each other wasn't a bothersome issue in S1 because it dealt with the start of the story, including the introduction of all the key characters. It also ended fairly strongly for the start of a lengthy rom-com saga, with the last few episodes being about Belldandy stopping the Lord of Terror from destroying the world.

In S2, however, there was only the introduction of mostly unimportant characters to draw the viewers attention away from Keiichi and Belldandy 's relationship. And there was no Lord of Terror type of story this time around to the end the series purposefully. Apart from one or two episodes that continued on from where the previous episode ended, the entire series was episodic. Even the final episode that aired on TV (22) was random, with little to no build-up. Even though I'm not doubting that all the content included in the series was taken from the manga, it wouldn't be unfair to label most of what was included as filler designed to stretch the story beyond reasonable limits. The manga is still on-going after something like 20 years, and I read that Keiichi and Belldandy STILL haven't kissed even in the manga, so I'm sure it'll only get worse in the future TV series. I'm hoping not but I can't see any way for the story to have lasted for 20 volumes without 90% of the chapters not adding anything constructive.

Watching S2 actually made me start to dislike both Keiichi and Belldandy. Keiichi's a complete loser, lacking any backbone, and his inability to even openly admit his love for Belldandy after living in the same house for over a year made him look really, really pathetic. It's normal for the lead character in a rom-com to be like that but the endless length of AMG makes it much more of an annoyance. And as for Belldandy, her carefree and 'love everyone, no matter what' attitude became bothersome as the series went on. You'd expect a woman to get a little sexually frustrated with a guy who can't even bring himself to kiss her, despite his obvious feelings, yet she seems more than happy to go her entire life without so much as kissing...unless cooking gives her orgasmic pleasure, which isn't out of the question going on how much she cares about what Keiichi thinks of it, her passive personality is as fake as you can get -- it'd only work well in an erotic game.

The only episodes I truly enjoyed, aside from a few that made me laugh, such as the one involving the plum spirit singing about how he loved Urd, were those that attempted to add character development, and those were few and far between. There was one episode near the start that presented Tamiya, the comical senior who bosses around wimpy Keiichi, as a real person who could fall in love, and there were another two that attempted to develop Skuld, the kid Goddess who wants Belldandy (her 'big sister') all to herself, into a more mature character by bringing a young male into the picture...but that was it really in terms of character development. Near enough everything else could be discarded without it damaging the series.

Another issue I have is how the supernatural (the Goddess and demon stuff) was handled. I'm well aware that, first and foremost, AMG is a rom-com and that the viewer isn't supposed to take anything seriously. However, I can't deny that it bugged me how Urd, a Goddess and one of Keiichi's harem, casually revealed her mother to be the leader of demon kind, and the same goes for seeing the leader of demon kind become just another member of Keiichi's harem. Goddesses are supposed to stop demon kind from doing demonic stuff, yet the three Goddesses at Keiichi's house see no problem with talking to them and being friendly... Shouldn't they attack demons on sight; not befriend them? It's all a bit too silly, even for a rom-com.

As for the visual and sound side, AMG (both seasons) is the most visually pleasing rom-com anime I've seen. The range of colours used is impressive, the art is very consistent, the anmation is good when it needs to be and the computer graphics blend well. The new music used in S2 isn't as good as the music from S1 but that isn't a big issue when S1 music gets used as well. In short, there are no problems.

Even though I've spent a lot of time complaining in the above paragraphs, I did actually enjoy watching it quite a bit. Not as much as S1 but that's to be expected -- after all, the start is always stronger than the middle, and stories usually only ever come close to matching the start near the end. It was very easy to watch because of its episodic nature and, despite a few characters coming across as fake, AMG isn't short of likeable characters. I rate S1 8-9/10, giving it 8/10 on MAL, and I rate S2 7-8/10, also giving it 8/10 on MAL. If I could I'd rate S1 8.5/10 and S2 7.5/10, but MAL doesn't allow me to give 0.5 ratings and makes it look like I view the two series as equal in terms of quality.

If there's to be a third season I hope Sayako, the posh chick and 'queen' of Keiichi's college, appears more. She only appeared during the early episodes of S2, which is a shame when she was probably my favourite character in S1. I also hope Megumi, Keiichi's tomboy of a younger sister, appears for more than a few seconds in any future AMG offerings. I can understand why most of the S1 supporting cast didn't get much time in S2 - they'd already had their own episodes in S1 - but they are far better characters than the likes of Peroth; the Goddess who acts like a hooker (I got the impression she only 'helps' humans sexually). I'd hate to see more poor characters thrown in and less time being given to the more likeable characters.

Anyway, enough. I rate the series 7.5/10 and, despite its flaws, hope a third season will be created. If there's still no progress after that then I'll consider dropping everything AMG, but until then I'll stay interested in seeing more of Belldandy.

Rating: 7.5/10",1235692800,2,7699,4.623262618873445

3563300,5,B001F2U71O,"I heard about Ah! My Goddess when I was in junior high from a classmate. When I accidentally discovered season 1 at Best Buy, I decided that I had to get it. I immediately fell in love with Belldandy's optimistic confidence and caring heart. I also enjoyed Keiichi's shyness and determination. It reminded me of myself. I couldn't wait for season 2.
 The voice acting for both Japanese and English dubbed are both rather decently equal in my opinion. The opening theme catches me from the start. The romance between Belldandy and Keiichi finds difficulty and perserverance. With difficulties from Urd's love potions, Skuld's inventions, Marller's evil wits, Megumi's nosiness, and the autoclub's crazy ideas, it proves quite challenging for Keiichi and Belldandy. Season 2 also introduces a few new interesting characters.
By far, this series of ""Ah! My Goddess"" has become my absolute #1 favorite anime of all time. It is well worth getting both seasons. I really hope season 3 makes it soon.",1230508800,,993,5.0181818181818185

3563345,5,B001F2U71O,"Ever since watching the first season back in 2005, I fell in love with this series. I really liked the characters and the story, but lost track of it over the years. It wasn't until recently that I got a chance to watch both seasons of the English dub, which was pretty well done IMO. I enjoyed the series enough that I wanted to buy both seasons, but since season 1 is out of print, season 2 was all I could afford. Thankfully this FUNimation release is quite affordable, allowing you to own the second season for less than 20 bucks.

If you are a fan of this series, buying this should be a no brainer. If you are not a fan, or not a fan yet, MediaBlaster (the publishers of the first season) has the complete first season in English on YouTube. If you check that out and like it, you should consider buying this.",1371254400,2,815,4.2243589743589745

3563349,5,B001F2U71O,"I'm assuming if anyone's checking out this dvd set, its because you are a fan of the series and you want to support it. I don't really want to get into the synopsis of the series since theres a hundred of reviews like that here on Amazon. Im going to actually talk about the dvds and the packaging they come in. This is what I was most concerned with since theres two other dvd sets released by Funinmation. One of the them sets has the SAVE logo, the one without the SAVE logo, and the first release that features Belldandy, Skuld, and Urd. According to the website the Rightstuff(I also happened to have purchased my copy from them, the non-SAVE one and the SAVE logo carry special features and the same aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The third copy doesnt carry special features and the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 but apparently comes with an Ah! my goddess keychain if you buy new according to Rightstuff. Between the SAVE logo and the non-SAVE logo, the SAVE logo has a green banner that has the words SAVE but you save a few bucks if you don't buy the non-SAVE logo. I highly recommend getting this DVD set if you want nice DVD boxart but still want a decent aspect ratio.",1361664000,,1167,4.382488479262673

3563372,5,B001F2U71O,"Keiichi is a very lucky young man. He has 3 Goddesses living with him. One of them is his girlfriend. He becomes an even luckier young man in season 2. The sexiest Goddess yet has come to grant him a wish. Somehow he reaches the Goddess help line again, and the Goddess Peorth comes to grant him his wish. Belldandy is upset with this. She feels that since Peorth has come, she may not have granted Keiichi's true wish. Peorth has certainly thrown a wrench in the works. This season has everything season 1 had and more.

I have loved the Ah! My Goddess series since it first came out with the short OVA. The second season is great. The animation, and soundtrack are both very good. I think the weakest part of this show is the English Dub. There are definitely better voice actors out there. I prefer to watch things in English. I don't like reading subtitles when I'm trying to watch something at the same time. A lot of people prefer the original language with subs. If you're one of them then this series should give you noting to dislike. Even though I said the English Dub is weak; it doesn't hurt the show either. Overall Ah! My Goddess season 2 is great and it's got a little something for everyone.",1351641600,5,1207,4.388392857142857

3563378,4,B001F2U71O,"If you love, love, love romantic/ relationship anime, then this series is perfect for you. I was introduced to Ah my goddess by watching the Movie before any of the TV Series. The animation was beautiful and I got hooked right away. I have seen the entire series, and I own the Movie, and I gotta tell ya, the 2nd season isn't all that great. The 1st season was wonderful, it had  a good solid story line, you got to learn and love the characters, and it had a good plot to the series. But season 2 is all fluff people. ***SPOILERS*** So Keichi made his wish and he has Belldandy by his side forever, and he is stuck with her two sisters, Urd and Skuld (Urd being older, Skuld being younger than Belldandy) So anyway, all is well and pretty much the entire second season is about Keichi telling Belldandy how much he loves her, which we all already know because he has told her, and we fans are pretty observant and know they love each other.
So the second season is just 25 episodes of showing everyday life with Keichi and Belldandy, and a little bit of drama every other episode or so.
So, after that exhaustive review, my advice would be to go and buy/ watch season 1, buy/ watch the AH My Goddess Movie, and be content because season 2 is nothing more than fluff with more fluff.
This anime does have great animation, and the movie is done very well. The music and voice actors are well cast, so I do enjoy this anime. I just don't enjoy 25 episodes of the same old thing over and over.",1314403200,7,1491,4.268551236749117

I liked the first season. It introduced the characters, set up the plot involving a relationship between our male protagonist & beautiful Goddess. It was a cute story that implied a real relationship was heading somewhere romantic. In the first season, our man Keiichi was kind of passive & wimpy towards life, but would rise to be heroic when the time calls. It looked like he would stand up & become a man at some point.
If you want to see that relationship progress, forget about it in the follow up season. This season is more episodic with various goofy challenges for Keiichi & the Godess siblings living with him. There is very little relationship progression, and if anything more regression to an unrealistic relationship. After 24 more episodes, Keiichi still doesn't have the sack to even hold hands with or admit any feelings at all to the girlfriend he's lived with for two years. I can go with a lot of silly things in anime, but one thing that really gets under my skin is the repeated use of a loaf of a guy character who is totally passive about everything happening around him constantly causing misunderstanding comedy/drama. They have to make the male protaganist incredibely stupid & wimpy for this plot device to work, turning Keiichi into nothing more than a foil for the plot instead of a realistic person.",1310083200,5,1398,4.686991869918699

If you don't have season One, that's ok also, you can pick up the story quite easily, it is not ""LOST"" or anything like that, it is a bit of whimsical fun for a rainy afternoon.

As far as the physical product is concerned, the disc case is no thicker than your standard DVD box, and contains four discs on which the 26 episodes are contained. I had no problems with discs out of place or damaged, as some boxes are won't to deliver.
Getting to the show itself, if you've seen Season 1, then you know what you're in for. Nothing TERRIBLY huge changes this season, so if you're looking for immense plot development and/or twists, this may not be the right series for you.
