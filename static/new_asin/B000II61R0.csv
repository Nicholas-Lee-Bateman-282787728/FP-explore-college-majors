8145593,3,B000II61R0,"It's nice to have a film about my favorite composer. I felt that the movie moved in different directions, beginning story threads that were never resolved. I also felt, as much as I adore Sibelius's music, that his music was often played in the background in places where it didn't fit. This isn't the best directed film ever, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I would only recommend this film to devoted fans of Sibelius such as myself. I plan on reading a book about Jean Sibelius in the near future to see how much of this film is true and to learn more about this fantastic composer. If you plan on getting this DVD, just be sure it will play on your player. I have a multi-region player so it'll play just about any DVD.",1245542400,2,725,4.377777777777778
