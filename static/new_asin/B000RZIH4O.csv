2877235,4,B000RZIH4O,"Want to visit all the New York sites significant in John Lennon's life but don't know where to start?  This DVD should be required viewing before planning such a trip. Interviews with Bob Gruen, David Peel, and Lennon's Japanese language instructor provide a fascinating portrait of his New York years.  Susan Ryan also interjects interesting facts about the history of New York itself.  If you can't see these sites in person, ""John Lennon's New York"" is the next best thing!",1190851200,8,476,4.925
2877236,4,B000RZIH4O,"Outside of London and, of course, Liverpool, New York City has more sites associated with The Beatles than any other city. John Lennon spent most of the last decade of his life in NYC so there are also plenty of sites associated with Lennon's post-Beatles life and they're virtually all here on this DVD. Trina Yannicos and Susan Ryan take us on an entertaining and informative tour of the Big Apple's Lennon sites. A must for any non-New Yorker Lennonphiles thinking of making the trip to NYC and handy for New York-based fans as well.",1190764800,5,536,4.652631578947369
8203315,3,B000RZIH4O,Some good info but not as good as I thought. Also said it ran for 300 min which it didn't.,1478822400,,90,3.55
8203316,5,B000RZIH4O,I took the NYC Beatle tour with Susan Ryan just in April.  I love her personality! She really knows & loves NYC and the Beatles !!  It was the best 2 hour walking tour ever !!  I bought the DVD and watched it later. It was Fabulous to see all the interviews!  There are a few places on the DVD that aren't there any longer so that was great to see.  If you take her tour first or after you watch the DVD----either way--you will love both !!!,1368316800,,441,3.965909090909091
8203317,1,B000RZIH4O,"Short and simple - my discs don't play on any of my 4 DVD players. Yep, I'm right here in Maryland so its not me.",1294099200,,113,3.56
8203318,4,B000RZIH4O,The DVD gives a wonderful overview of the highlights in NYC of places that John Lennon frequented. Ms. Ryan provides colorful information on the DVD as well and she is an engaging presence.  I agree with others that Ms. Yannicos may want to consider voice lessons if she is to continue on this path--her voice's tone and constant use of the term 'actually' are an unfortunate distraction. Despite that drawback I recommend this highly to any Lennon fan or anyone seeking a walking tour in NYC that is music related or Beatles related. A++++.,1276473600,,541,4.75531914893617
8203319,1,B000RZIH4O,"Nice try, but good Lord, it's actually an actually horrible video.  BUT, not because the places they visited, but the commentary is terrible.  Ruins it.  The chick with the whiny voice--count the 'actually's--terrible.  This could have been a wonderful documentary, but...no.. Actually...",1251244800,,288,5.785714285714286
8203320,5,B000RZIH4O,"I purchased the DVD for my daughter and I to watch and we both thoroughly enjoyed the tour given by Trina and Susan! The DVD provides insight into the life Lennon lived in NYC and the locations he visited. Trina and Susan really know their facts on John and NYC. We enjoyed the DVD so much that we already booked an actual tour with Susan while we are vacationing in New Yok.

Bottom Line: The DVD is worth the money and you will enjoy it!",1246147200,,439,4.1647058823529415
8203321,4,B000RZIH4O,"If you enjoy a thorough and lively tour through the haunts of the places John used to hang out and the people he knew.  Check this DVD out.  I was entertained by the touring of Susan and Trina.  They truly have amassed a great deal of knowledge making this DVD a great educational tool for the fan wanting to learn it all about John when he lived in NYC.  Some places, liek LaFortuna are disappearing and this is a wonderful tribute to these places.

I found out a few things I didn't know and I know quite a bit about John and his life.  I'm a Beatles Historian and used to work at the Hard Rock Vault as their expert on The Beatles.  Pick up this delightful and thorough DVD and spend an afternoon getting lost in the memories with Trina, Susan and their guests.",1223596800,4,764,4.227586206896552

8203323,5,B000RZIH4O,"In the 40 plus years since The Beatles sang on Ed Sullivan, Americans have been digesting the same tired diet of Beatle information. So many books, mags, movies, etc. tell the same ole story. But the ground covered (lol) in Ryan's and Yannicos's ""John Lennon's New York"" is new, fresh, and yes...interesting! This walking tour of the city isn't just a glimpse of The Dakota or Strawberry Fields. You will see John's pharmacy, the intimate cafe where he sipped early morning cappucinos, and the friends he made while in New York City. If you're bored with the routine Beatle fare (as I was!) and want to LEARN something new about John, you'll love the video. Since it is three hours long, you get your money's worth. I absolutely loved it.",1208131200,3,738,4.684615384615385
8203324,3,B000RZIH4O,I have been to NY and researched all the spots that were associated with John Lennon and the producers did a good job.  Only negaative is the speakers voice....WOW!,1194480000,,164,4.655172413793103
