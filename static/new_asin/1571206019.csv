188148,5,1571206019,Like all of Judith Baker Montano's books and DVDs this is very user friendly.  And a feast for the eye.,1229385600,11,103,4.15
188149,5,1571206019,"This is a fantastic video.  I was very impressed and happy with this.  I made a small crazy quilt purse several years ago, but needed a refresher.  Even if you have never made a crazy quilt block before, using this video you can learn to make a crazy quilt wall hanging or a pillow or anything you want.  The possibilities are endless.  The video is very good, shows detail of her hands, shows different threads to use for embroidery and some great information on embellishment using ribbon and wonderful techniques for making a couple of flowers using just plain satin ribbon.  Also, shows how to select fabrics for your crazy quilt block and there is a segment on color selection.  Another thing I like about the video is that, after you have watched it and you want to go back later to review just the embroidery techniques, there is a menu at the beginning where you can choose the part that you want to watch.  You don't have to watch the whole thing again, or forward through trying to find what you need.  Very happy with this purchase.  I highly recommend it.",1357862400,3,1067,4.510416666666667
188150,5,1571206019,A great way to have a comprehensive class with Judith Baker Montano. Her crazy quilt technique is excellent and her samples are inspiring.,1349049600,,138,5.043478260869565
188151,5,1571206019,Received the DVD in short time and in great condition.  The crazy quilting and embroidery in this are awesome!  Very easy to understand and if you are a visual person you will love it!,1334016000,,184,4.382352941176471
188152,5,1571206019,What a pleasure learning all about crazy quilts. The Teacher explained every step in detail and added her helpful hints and short cuts.  This DVD is truly amazing.  The camera man focused on her hands so every detail and step she taught was seen and understood clearly. This DVD gets an A+,1330128000,4,289,4.538461538461538
188153,5,1571206019,"I enjoyed it and felt that even though I am a veteran quilter, have most of Judith's books and even attended a lunch lecture by her at the show in Houston--I still learned from it. Very well done and thorough.  You won't regret buying this one.",1311811200,2,244,4.304347826086956
188154,5,1571206019,"Great instructor, high quality DVD.  I always appreciate master artist quilters who are willing to share their skills on DVD.  It makes it so much more accessible to people who can't afford to travel to quilt conventions etc.  Judith has a very charming, warm and engaging personality so its a pure joy to listen to her instruct.  I learned more from this DVD than I did from previous books I've purchased on crazy quilting.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1300665600,4,454,4.69620253164557
188155,5,1571206019,"This is a keeper.  If you are interested in Crazy Quilting, this is a book you should have.  I have done other types of quilting, but this was new to me.  I had some ideas of how it should work, however I'm glad I decide to get this reference book because it saved me from making a few errors.  Because you can use such luscious (and expensive) fabrics, threads, and adornments; you don't want many mistakes!  It was originally published in 1986 and has been revised and reprinted in 2001 and is truly one of the best technique guides out (evidences by not having gone out of print in over 20+ years).  I would also suggest getting her DVD (the same title), I used them both together as if I were attending a class.  I was Crazy Quilting in no time at all and enjoying the whole process.",1269216000,7,787,4.277027027027027
188156,5,1571206019,"If you've never done crazy quilting, this video will get you on your way.  The multi-chapter format makes it easy to get right to what you want to watch or re-watch.",1257292800,2,165,4.32258064516129
188157,4,1571206019,I bought this item thinking it was a book.  When a DVD arrived I was very dissapointed and a bit angry the purchase hadn't been clearer.  But I watched the DVD and was very impressed by the quality of the content. It gave me much better visualising than I would be able to get in a book and picked up on handy hints that I might of just brushed over.  Overall was very impressed with detail of the DVD.,1256774400,3,402,4.063291139240507
188158,5,1571206019,"I'm a beginner Crazy Quilter and embroiderer and have found this DVD to be really helpful! I don't learn easily by watching and trying to emulate but JBM really makes me feel confident to try the stitches and putting together a CQ block. I recommend this DVD with absolutely no reservations. She teaches about color theory, shows how to assemble a block, teaches how to embellish a block, how to ribbon embroidery, attach laces, ribbons and charms, and covers all aspects of CQ'ing. Don't know what I'd do without it!",1239321600,21,517,4.7555555555555555

7797301,5,1571206019,"I've always admired crazy quilts in museums, and while I love quilting, I never felt I had the skills necessary to make one. However Judith teaches in this video that it's not as hard as it looks. She goes into a lot of detail on choosing fabrics, how to choose textures, colors, etc. Then she demonstrates from beginning to finishing how to make the quilt using foundation muslin, how to do the decorative stitches, etc. I immediately bought a grab bag of velvet, satin and brocade scraps and did a table runner. How pretty! It looks great and looks much more difficult to do than it actually was. I will watch this one over and over as I learn something new each time. Try it!",1370044800,,678,4.432
