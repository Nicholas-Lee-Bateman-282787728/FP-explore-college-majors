7895567,5,6305825742,"This First Draw set is an unbelieveably priced collection of the pilots or premier episodes of popular westerns of the past.  Once I saw that two episodes of Have Gun Will Travel was included I was sold.  Richard Boone playing Paladin was the epitome of cool decked out in his all black outfit and pencil thin moustache.  One episode included a young Charles Bronson playing a bad guy.
A youthful, pre-spaghetti western Clint Eastwood playing in Rawhide also was something special.  I was never a big fan of Gunsmoke but James Arness diligently does his thing as Marshal Matt Dillon in the pilot episode.
Also included in this set was the initial episode of the Wild Wild West which was a more recent and cutting edge western that I always enjoyed.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin playing secret agents working for President U.S. Grant combined the ingenuity of a James Bond type plot with the earthiness of an old style western.
This set was a very nostalgic blast from the past at a ridiculously cheap price.  I highly recommend it.",1042588800,20,1033,4.711111111111111
