3526711,3,B001D7T45Q,It will have been nice to add to this collection of the Titans the great Houston Oilers Games since there's no way you can find the games of the Oilers on DVD.,1328486400,,159,4.0
3526712,3,B001D7T45Q,"i wasn't gonna get this because im a HUDGE Jaguars fan, and i dispise the titans, but it has the 1999 afc championship in which the jags played in, so im probably will buy it for that reason alone",1312070400,,196,4.051282051282051
3526713,5,B001D7T45Q,"love it!!! I love it so much that i am in the process of buying the greatest games of other teams. I wish that the NFL could/would product these in a better way. Perhaps a person could pick any three to five games and have them converted to a video/DVD pack. That would be something!!! As far as the Titans go, they could easily make a five or ten games.  i would love to see the November 2009 game between the Titans and Cardinal where Vince Young throws for over 350 yards and makes a game winning throw on the last play of the game!!!  So perhaps, we will have a volume 2.",1307577600,,575,4.079646017699115
3526714,3,B001D7T45Q,"The quality of the 3 greatest games is acceptable and I did get what I expected, but for an item that was ""in-stock"" it took forever to get. I normally do not use express shipping, but I was needing these DVDs asap so I was thinking it would be a good investment. 10 days is NOT express. I normally receive regular deliveries in less than 7 days. I will never pay extra for shipping again.",1252540800,,389,4.2
3526715,4,B001D7T45Q,"In this 3-pack, you get the Music City Miracle game, the 1999-2000 AFC Championship game against the Jaguars, and Vince Young's first game in Houston, where he scored the winning TD in OT.

This is the full replay (minus commericals) of the televised game.  The only real negative is that the games were not shot in HD, so you don't get the clarity that you see in today's games.  They still look really good.

The choice of the Houston game probably wasn't the best, since Vince isn't the starter now.  It was still a great game for him, but I would have liked the 1999-2000 Indy playoff game, the 2002-2003 Steelers playoff game, or even the 2003-2004 Baltimore playoff game instead.",1249430400,6,685,4.628099173553719
3526716,1,B001D7T45Q,"This DVD set shows three DVD's, while Amazon states there are ten.  The other series that show ten, Amazon states 2.  Makes you want to wait until after they come out to truly find out.",1218499200,,185,4.257142857142857
8292099,3,B001D7T45Q,This isn't not a review just wondering why there is no greatest game series for the Miami dolphins whith all the great dan Marino games there has to be at least three they can pick and put them together I would jump on it as soon as they made it,1517616000,,245,3.92
8292100,5,B001D7T45Q,"Awesome! My husband loved this as one of his Father's Day gifts. He shared it was good to see the entire games again, as they are rarely shown all the way through because of the years they were played.",1497916800,,201,4.17948717948718
8292101,5,B001D7T45Q,"As a Titans fan, I loved the DVD..  You get a blast from the past!!!! Steve mcnair and eddie George.

8292102,5,B001D7T45Q,Great Seller A+,1486944000,,15,4.333333333333333
8292103,4,B001D7T45Q,"This small three game ""best of"" set includes the craziest ending in a post-season contest, one that cemented forever the Buffalo Bills reputation for post-season hard luck. That DVD, (disc one) of this package, is well worth the price of admission.

You may not recall that Titans/Bills clash, for it was the very first post-season game, a Saturday afternoon affair, of the 1999 playoffs (game occurred on 1/8/00). I've seen it and still cannot believe how this one went down.

Even non-Titans fans will marvel at the last few actual time minutes of this incredible game; events so amazing you'd swear they were part of a fictional movie.",1469491200,,638,4.898148148148148
8292104,4,B001D7T45Q,Great games with Air Mcnair!,1444176000,,28,4.8
8292105,3,B001D7T45Q,I enjoyed the three games but those Titans teams played in a lot of big games from 1999-2003. It would have been great to include a few more.,1439337600,,141,4.071428571428571

8292107,5,B001D7T45Q,Great dvd it was great to relive the music city miracle one more time. Nice purchase,1424995200,,84,4.3125
8292108,3,B001D7T45Q,"Decent selection , although not having Titans playoff wins against Steelers or ravens was a letdown. If not that season then a game from 08 playoff year would've sufficed. Either way RIP Air McNair and can't complain having the Music Cith Miracle",1422316800,,246,4.880952380952381
