8535104,5,B00939MRSW,"This is scary good!. I saw this somewhere else and it isn't one that can be forgotten very quickly. This man doesn't hold back he gives you the recipes for just about anything you could ever want to do and some you'd be afraid to do. Especially considering the law of three,that should tell you the type of stuff he includes. Sadly the man in the video adn the cover was very ill possible terminally ill if I remember correctly so he wanted to get his knowledge out here for the new Witches as well as the ones of us that have already been on this path for awhile. Trust me you WILL learn new and wonderous things!. Blessed Be...",1425427200,,629,4.25
8535105,4,B00939MRSW,"Although beief, I enjoyed the subject matter. I would have liked the last portion of this presentation to have been edited better. I don't have zoom capacity which is ehat is needed to get a reasonable viewing at this point. Orherwise I would have given 5 stars.",1406851200,,262,4.595744680851064
8535106,4,B00939MRSW,i loved the creepy intros. some practical information regarding subjects that many in the craft are reluctant to discuss ie cursing and use of entheogens.,1378252800,4,154,5.2
8535107,5,B00939MRSW,"If you are interested in Traditional Witchcraft and you go hunting about in video land there isn't much that is genuine, true or of the least quality on Youtube or here on Amazon, etc.  This on the other hand is unabashedly and forthrightly within the realm of what you would be looking for as such.  A rare find indeed.  Highly recommended.

Regarding the flying ointment segment: I don't agree that application of salve or oil on the genitals is advised or necessary or works best. The perineum or the fold of the arm is more common and safer. Also the effects of these alkaloids can last much longer and be recurring. The vid says half an hour. I've seen it go on and off and on again for a week or more depending on dosage. Mushrooms like Amanita in proper strength/dosage are reliably of short duration to within say 2 or 3 hours. The witch plants like Mandragora and so on, are not reliably of short duration at all.

Also the constant refrain that this 'should be done in ritual' with chanting and focus and so on: perhaps a bit more description and example would be helpful rather than simply saying that repeatedly then leaving it out otherwise.  It is important but I'm afraid that this will fall on deaf ears without further explanation.

Most if not all of the content of this DVD is available on youtube for free by the way.",1375833600,5,1337,4.477366255144033
8535108,5,B00939MRSW,"This DVD is by my brother who is extremely knowledgeable, sincere and passionate about his subject.
I bought it because he has a terminal illness and not very long to live, so for me it will be more of a living memorial.
So whether you have an particular interest or merely idle curiosity about the subject of British Witchcraft you will learn an enormous amount and it is a hugely fascinating and informative!",1348963200,13,410,4.63013698630137
8535109,5,B00939MRSW,Along with my wife Anna I watched British Witchcraft by Nick Ridge. We were thrilled to be able to have a view into this other world of British Witchcraft. As I have been looking for educational reasources on this subject for some time it was nice to be able to peer into the practices of this lesser known and to a greater extent hidden form of Witchcraft. And Nick Ridge did a phenomenal job of presenting the various individual subject matter covered in this Dvd. I would greatly recommend this Dvd to anyone that would like to peek into the world of the Cunningfolk of England-Two thumbs up to Nick Ridge I hope he creates more works on his version of the Art of British Witchcraft.,1347321600,10,686,4.4523809523809526
8535110,5,B00939MRSW,"having watched this very informative, well crafted dvd. i feel i now have more knowledge on british witchcraft and herbalism. thank you to Nick for sharing his years of knowlegde on these very interesting aspects of traditional british witchcraft. I enjoyed the very real and down to earth presentation which made it feel like this was not a lecture but a personal conversation between two people. Very refreshing to see someone with such passion about a subject close to my own heart.",1346457600,4,485,4.926829268292683
