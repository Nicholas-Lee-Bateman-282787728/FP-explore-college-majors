Wonderful stretching, strengthening moves, then followed by fun and challenging dance moves.  I purchased 2 additional ones years ago in case my original dies, but it's still going.  Wish they'd put on DVD!",1455408000,2,369,4.903225806451613

8046034,5,B000793A1A,"I have had this video for years, but it seems that every time I move, I manage to lose it but it worth buying again and again. This is a good workout video for someone who is NOT looking to slide up and down a dance pole.",1285113600,2,221,3.723404255319149
