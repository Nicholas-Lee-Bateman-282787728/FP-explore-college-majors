She loved this video and danced along happily!",1406678400,,137,4.708333333333333
8488043,5,B005WOADYW,"My nineteen-month-old daughter absolutely LOVES and adores Barney. This was her very first Barney video, and she will watch it day and night.

Her first copy was stolen by someone I thought was a friend, so I was desperate to find her another one. When I found it here on Amazon, I was delighted. It was perfect. The same video she loved, and she was ecstatic to see it on the screen once more.

It's a cute little video with catchy songs, education and moral lessons every child should learn.

I used to be obsessed with Barney as a child, and it's wonderful to see that he's still going strong enough to be here on Amazon.",1405555200,,624,4.362068965517241

8488048,4,B005WOADYW,"Having 3 girls I feel like my life has been filled with Barney for the last 10 years . . . but I really don't mind. His classic ""I Love You"" song will guarantee me some hugs and kisses each time without fail. Gotta love that!

There are 3 episodes in this compilation - 2 we haven't seen before and 1 from when my oldest daughter was a baby. Each one talked about the importance of friendship and being nice to one another.

Kaila really enjoyed this DVD like she does all the other Barney television episodes. The message of friendship is very important for kids who are just starting pre-school and Barney makes it fun to learn and use your imagination. Barney: I Love My Friends is a great addition to our family library.",1326585600,,724,4.355555555555555
