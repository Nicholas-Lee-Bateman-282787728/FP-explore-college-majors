Laura rides her horse Bunny to town. Carolyn bargains for a bolt of cloth. [Note the home-made box on the table.] Mary knits at Mrs. Whipple's home. Charles is near to completing those wheels. Carey spends her penny on a star. Charles wants to buy a stove but it's sold. Later he shoots a turkey for food. Mr. Olesen delivers a heavy crate to the Ingall's home. Mary gets a warm fur shawl for Christmas. Pa gets a warm shirt. Laura gets a saddle for her pony. Ma gets a cast-iron stove (fuel efficient). They learn Laura traded her pony for that stove.

A Christmas They Never Forgot
Hester-Sue arrives with her wagon. Mary has returned! There is a Christmas feast. The snow falls heavily, their guests cannot leave. Carolyn tells a story from her past. Her father died when she was young and her mother remarried. [Quite common in the 19th century when death parted married couples frequently.] Young Carolyn reconciles to the change. A young man tells his story. The older brother told his younger brother the truth about Santa Claus. But his father explained Santa's delivery system. [Outsourcing.] Outside the wind howled. Laura tells about their first Christmas in Kansas. [Crossing a stream in winter can kill.] Mr. Edwards brought the girls presents for Christmas. Their own tin cups. Sweet potatoes too. ""It was the best Christmas ever."" Someone must stay up to watch the fire overnight. Hester-Sue remembers her past on a plantation. [Did they have toy trains in those days?] What presents will they get? ""Thanks, Santa."" They are snowed in the next morning. Snowshoes allow a trip to the barn. ""Merry Christmas!"" The presents are retrieved from the barn.
