8074127,4,B0009K742S,"Asterix is one of the funniest, well drawn Franco-Belgian series, alongside Tintin, lucky Luke and Spirou. It is set in 50 BC and revolves around a village of Gauls in Normandy, France that resist Julius Caesar's mighty Roman Army with the help of a magic potion brewed by the village druid Getafix.

This boxset contains 3 cartoons. The first, ""Asterix and Cleopatra"", is the oldest, made in the late 60's. In it, Cleopatra bets caesar that the Egyptians could build him a palace in less than 3 months in Alexandria to prove to him that the Egyptians are the greatest people in the Civilized world. She hires architect Edifis to help her, and he goes to Gaul to seek Asterix, Obelix and Getafix's help. The animation is not as good as the other two cartoons, but what it lacks for in art, it makes up for in spirit. The cartoon has a good feel to it, and the songs are enjoyable. On the whole, it is a good adaptation of the comic book installment of the same name. I would give this movie a 3 out of 5.

The second movie "" The Twelve Tasks of Asterix""( les Douzes Travaux D'Asterix) is the best movie in this boxset. Made in 1976, it was the only movie made entirely under the control of the two Asterix co-creators, Albert Uderzo and the late Rene Goscinny. The animation is quite amazing for it's time, and is still amazing today. This wasn't based on any book, but was an idea developed by the co-creators. The story is that Julius Caesar sets the Gauls twelve Herculean tasks to perform, and should they succeed in each and every one, he will surrender Rome to them and officially declare that the Gaulish Villagers are Gods. The plot is hilarious, and personally this is my favorite Asterix movie. It deserves a 5 out of 5.

The third movie, ""le Coup Du Menhir"" ,is a mixture of two Asterix books, ""Big Fight"" and ""Asterix and the Soothsayer"". In it, Obelix heavily injures the druid Getafix in an attempt to save him from being kidnapped by the Romans. As a result, Getafix gets amnesia, and with his memory goes the formula to the magic potion, a secret only Getafix himself knows. And to make matters worse, a wandering soothsayer calls in during a storm and everyone in the village but Asterix is convinced that his prophecies are accurate. The storyline is good, although I'm not alright with the idea of mixing two Asterix books together to make a movie. The animation is also good ( it was made in he 80's).

All in all, this collection is worth getting since it contains the better Asterix cartoons.",1123286400,5,2514,4.506578947368421
