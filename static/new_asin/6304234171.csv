8594573,5,6304234171,"This is proof that you do not have to leave your house for an  evening of fine entertainment.  It was worth it just to see my favorite, Frederica von Stade, doing a delightful rendition of her signature number from La Pericole.... she is warm and charming as usual.",1068336000,,265,4.5
8594574,5,6304234171,"This video is one of the best productions I've seen. The camera work, sound, and presentation are first rate. The only disapointment was that so many of the selections were cut out. I only received Volume 1 and there are no others offered. I think the total performance was about six hours. This volume is only 160 minutes.",1065484800,,323,4.586206896551724
