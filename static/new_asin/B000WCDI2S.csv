8222414,1,B000WCDI2S,"This Documentary is not a video documentary at all. It's a still picture documentary like a powerpoint presentation.
It's very basic, poorly made, the narrator's voice is too atonal and dull, too short at 19 minutes and definitely not worth the price.
A much better option as a documentary on Bhutan is
Bhutan: Taking The Middle Path To Happiness  by  Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba (Actor), Lyonpo Jigme Yoezar Thinley (Actor), Thomas Vendetti (Director), Producers: John Wehrheim & Robert Stone (Director",1343952000,4,495,5.253164556962025
