208062,5,581990608X,"There were four of us in the family caught up in this Korean drama. We loved it! Beautifully filmed too, American film makers should take lessons.",1436745600,9,146,4.653846153846154
208063,5,581990608X,"Loved it. Watched it twice within 2 months time. My absolute favorite. I'm trying to convince myself the ending was good, but I think it was bittersweet. Again, I just wish the Korean dramas would once in awhile have a ""happy ever after"" ending.",1434240000,3,245,4.590909090909091
208064,4,581990608X,"Is stunning. Gut wrenching, amazing cast, costume design and musical sound track.",1433030400,3,81,5.833333333333333
208065,5,581990608X,"As someone that knows no Korean, it had me hooked from the characters, storyline, and backdrops.

Each character brought something to the overall story that as every episode ended, you had to stay awake to watch ""just one more"" It took almost 2 weeks to watch them all.

You will think this is cliche when watching some scenes but it still keeps you watching all the way to the end. Be prepared to cry a lot!!",1432857600,2,409,4.368421052631579
208066,5,581990608X,"Found this movie on HULU PLUS. All 51 episodes. Loving it. To get an idea of what it is about, please, read the editorial reviews. They do a much better job then I would do. However, I can share with you that the acting,  script ( so well written), cinematography ( the settings  and costumes are so lavish and beautiful),acting ( the characters are so believable), and directing is superb. This movie holds my interest more than any epic I have ever seen. And, it is, truly, an epic. It has romance ( without all the grunts, groans, and tongue tying) so common in American movies, treachery, betrayal, and action. I am on episode 14. I am excited to have found something so  different than I wound  have seen on any cable network. Remember, it is a Korean movie, so there are subtitles. You will enjoy it!",1432598400,3,806,4.462585034013605
208067,5,581990608X,Excellent drama.  Great subtitles.,1431648000,,34,7.5
208068,1,581990608X,"Even though Ha Ji Won is one of our favorite Korean actresses I returned this one without even watching the film.  I've never seen such poor packaging for a DVD collection: a couple of hooks and DVD sleeves in a box that had to be taped shut, all this inserted into a flimsy paper box. I'll try the Singapore version which has some indications of being packaged better (cross my fingers).  I don't care how good the movie is, the publisher/distributor should be embarrassed to deliver a product with such poor packaging.",1413590400,4,520,4.641304347826087
208069,5,581990608X,I love this show and just had to have the DVD set of the series,1498262400,,63,3.2666666666666666
208070,5,581990608X,Loved it!!  Didn't mind the occasional grammatical or spelling errors in the sub titles. Enjoyed the gorgeous costumes and  sets.,1497916800,,129,5.4
208071,5,581990608X,Excellent quality,1489622400,,17,8.0
208072,2,581990608X,What a disappointment. The English subtitles are almost non-existent. One can't follow the story at all. Paid a lot of money for a movie I really can't watch. I've watched other Korean dramas with excellent English sub-titles. This series really falls short.,1489363200,2,258,5.166666666666667
208073,5,581990608X,Happy spouse.,1482192000,,13,6.0
208074,5,581990608X,I love this movie. The actors and actresses really did their part very well.  I have one favorite actor the Viceroy he's very serious but brainy on his part. And he's cute as well. I love the story I learned the history. Overall rating perect very clear.,1477008000,,254,4.404255319148936
208075,5,581990608X,Clean and interesting,1471219200,,21,6.333333333333333
208076,5,581990608X,Bought this for my mom and she loves it! Watches it over and over and got me hooked on it as well.,1466726400,,98,3.5
208077,4,581990608X,"Very good Korean historical drama.  Got kinda long in parts, but over all very good movie.",1466294400,,90,4.625
208078,5,581990608X,"I loved this tv series and first viewed it online.  This set has the alternate ending that was rebroadcast after the first broadcast.  The initial ending was ok, but this was better as it kept with the theme of ""protecting"" others.  I will say that the subtitles online were much better.  These were good at times, then pretty bad, then good -- it was always a mix, but still worth purchasing.  Probably my most favorite historical series, followed by Yi San.  You will experience every emotion possible and use a lot of tissues.  The acting and script were superb.  Ha Ji Won was astonishing in her portrayal of Empress Ki -- she had many challenges and significant growth as the character and was able to act convincingly.  She is now my favorite Korean actress.  Guys should enjoy this as well, because there are plenty of action scenes, political maneuvering, palace intrigue, and great male characters.  Realize that it is not historically accurate but a drama based on the life of Empress Ki.  You can purchase the soundtrack music (on iTunes) as well.  Can't say enough good things about this one.",1465776000,3,1104,4.747368421052632
208079,5,581990608X,"I watched few episodes on The Korean channel and it did not really appeal to me, maybe because I missed lots otof them. Then  when I red the reviews I decided to purchase it and now I so excited about it. In general I am a huge fan of K-dramas especially of the period ones.",1464220800,2,274,3.981818181818182
208080,3,581990608X,My box was broken when i got it. I can still put it on a shelf and it looks nice but the dvds fall out when you take the box set off of the shelf. Other than that the shipping was fast,1463011200,,184,3.4047619047619047
208081,5,581990608X,"The video is of very good quality also with very good subtitleing, very easy to follow the story. Packageing look little cheap but I'll take that with the Excelent Video and Translation any time. Loved it all. Hard to stop watching (even after six episodes)",1462924800,,257,4.733333333333333
208082,5,581990608X,Actors were perfect for the rolls. Costumes and set were brilliantlying done,1461542400,,76,5.416666666666667
208083,2,581990608X,"Korean filmmakers must be having a brain-drain. This is the third series I've watched where a woman poses as a man (for years!) and none of the men seem to notice. I'd hate to think that Korean men are so nave as to not notice. Many of the people in this film I've seen in other film series, so I know they can act better than this. The acting is very hammy. Best I can say is that it's mildly entertaining.",1460160000,2,407,4.037037037037037
208084,4,581990608X,Picture and sound is good although I was disappointed the format was 4:3 and not 16:9.  There are some misspelling in the subtitle.,1456963200,3,131,4.695652173913044
208085,5,581990608X,ONE OF THE BEST KOREAN DRAMAS EVER MADE!!!,1448323200,,42,4.375
208086,5,581990608X,"Beautiful packaging and great drama, too. Throughout, there were not a dull moments.  Cinematography was beautifully done. The costumes were something else, too. For a person who have interest in fashion field, this is an inspirational. I love Korean drams because they are very clean, deliver story without a excessive sex seances (unlike, over exposed American's films). I would recommend it to all. You will not walk away bored instead you will be an awh.",1448150400,9,458,5.1066666666666665
208087,5,581990608X,I'm a huge movie guy.  Korean drama with no english had me doubtful that I enjoy it.  I glad to say I was wrong!  My whole house was hooked on this for 3 weeks.  It's like a korean Lord of the rings mixed with the Notebook and sprinkle of Kill Bill revenge on it.  After watching this you may look at your friends/enemies differently.  Worth every penny but I really want it on blu ray.  I love it so much I'm gonna get it on both formats.,1442620800,,439,3.9770114942528734
208088,5,581990608X,This was my first Korean classic drama . I enjoyed very much because good story line and beautiful actors. I love Chi Chang Wook.,1442016000,,129,4.416666666666667
7802608,5,581990608X,"I've watched about a dozen historical Korean dramas, and this one's my favorite.  Ha Ji Won does a tremendous job playing a Korean slave girl who fights her way to the top of the Chinese empire.  She has a unique ability to play someone who is beautiful and super tough, without being hard.  That's a very difficult thing to pull off.  She seems to specialize in that kind of role.  If you like her in this, try Secret Garden, which is also excellent.

The Emperor is played by Ji Chang-wook.  As a guy, I'm not into guys, but after watching over a hundred k-dramas, I'd pick him as the best looking actor in South Korea.  If you like him in this, try the k-drama Healer.  He's absolutely awesome in that series.

If you want to try historical k-dramas, you couldn't pick a better one to start with than this.",1522800000,,809,4.369127516778524
7802609,5,581990608X,"Empress Ki is a high quality, classy, thought-provoking drama without an ounce of profanity or blatant sex!  How refreshing!  The multi-leveled, complex storyline and superior acting coupled with such exquisite costuming moved this work of art to the category of an epic classic!",1519430400,,279,5.465116279069767

7802612,3,581990608X,I sure wish it was dubbed in English but at least it has english subtitles. I like the storyline and costumes and drama but I don't always feel like reading 100% to understand. Thats the only negative.,1512864000,,201,4.45945945945946
