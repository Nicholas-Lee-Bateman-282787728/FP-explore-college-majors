3629626,5,B001HC788M,If you like musicals Rodgers and Hammerstein's  are still the best .  This 3 movie pack is so good and such a pleasure . But I watched Carousel first so I wouldn't go to bed crying :),1366761600,,183,3.918918918918919

3629628,4,B001HC788M,"Three early Broadway musicals by the definitive team of Rodgers & Hammerstein are here released in a single case.  Of the three, the best is probably ""Oklahoma!,"" filmed in 1955, which happens also to have been the team's breakout hit on stage twelve years earlier.  Gordon MacRae plays Curly McLain, a young cowboy in early 20th-century Oklahoma, who is courting Laurey Williams (Shirley Jones in her film debut), a pretty farm girl being raised by her spry and sprightly Aunt Eller (Charlotte Greenwood).  But Laurey thinks he's presumptuous and doesn't like to be gossiped about, and takes pride in the fact that she has ""never...looked back to sigh/Over a romance behind me.""  So she keeps running hot and cold until she finally agrees to go to the box social with her aunt's farmhand, the sinister Jud Frye (Rod Steiger), whose feelings for her are far deeper than she knew--and, as Curly finds out, frightening.  Meanwhile Curly's friend Will Parker (Gene Nelson) tries to win Ado Annie Carnes (Gloria Grahame), whose farmer father (James Whitmore) has given his word that if he's ever worth as much as $50 he can have her.  All the original songs from the Broadway version are here, and the script follows the stage book tightly.

""Carousel"" teams MacRae and Jones again (a year later), this time in 1880's New England; he's Billy Bigelow, who barks for a travelling carousel (""Of course, it takes talent to do that well""), and she's Julie Jordan, a mill girl who falls in love with him--and he with her, despite the fact that neither of them has any intention of doing any such thing, or of marrying anyone.  But marry they do, and there their troubles begin, for they both lose their jobs over it, and Billy has no skill at anything but barking--and too much pride to try to learn any new ones.  Though a very good adaptation, this one unfortunately drops some exposition (how Julie's friend Carrie Pipperidge (Barbara Ruick) and her beau Enoch Snow (Robert Rounseville) make up, how Enoch gets so prosperous 15 years later, and how Billy ends up polishing stars in Heaven), which would have made it more enjoyable.

The third movie in the set was actually the first one made: ""State Fair"" was filmed in 1945, a remake of a version of 12 years earlier.  Despite having introduced at least one song (""It Might As Well Be Spring"") that everyone will recognize, it's much less interesting than either of the other two.  The Frake family--restless Margy (Jeanne Crain), whose longtime beau is pressuring her to marry; her brother Wayne (Dick Haymes), whose girlfriend is stuck at home owing to her grandmother's illness; mother Melissa (Fay Bainter) with pickles and mincemeat to enter in the contests; and father Abel (Charles Winninger) with his beloved prize Hampshire boar, Blue Boy--sets off for the Iowa State Fair, and there both Margy and Wayne find love (or at least they think they do) while their parents cope with the competition and the vagaries of judges.  While your mileage may vary, I found that I really couldn't get too excited about the Frakes' fortunes, and while I'll definitely be keeping the set, I doubt I'll watch this element of it another time.",1278115200,4,3177,4.828729281767956

8308637,3,B001HC788M,"Since I'm not a movie reviewer, I won't give in-depth reviews, but Carousel was pretty enjoyable. Oklahoma was a bit strange, especially the very long 'dream sequence'. Haven't watched State Fair yet, but all in all, the quality and delivery was good, and seems like a great value.",1443916800,,281,4.875
8308638,1,B001HC788M,"Oklahoma is my favorite all-time musical, followed closely by Carousel and State Fair.  However, I give it one star because there are scenes missing, and some scenes are different.  The changes are often subtle, but it totally ruins the feel of the scene.  And I HATE the wide screen!  Sometimes the feet are cut off and sometimes the tops of their heads, but let's be sure to show all the scenery behind!!  Especially in Oklahoma!  I love to see Will and the dancer's feet when they're tap dancing, but they are cut off at the knees.  This was definitely not worth the expensive price, even though it's 3 classic movies.",1427155200,3,621,4.590909090909091
