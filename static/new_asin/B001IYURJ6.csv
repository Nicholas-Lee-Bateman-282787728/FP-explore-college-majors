8311572,4,B001IYURJ6,"My title is the direct translation of the spanish title. We hear this sentence in one scene and it is very significant for all characters. In order to move on, one must once in a while forget about the past.
""Quemar las naves"" is a coming-out story, that takes place in very religious Mexico, which makes it even more luring. The centre plot focuses on the life of Sebastian and Helena (siblings) and their dying of cancer mother, former pop singer, Eugenia...
If you look for cheap blue scenes or a lot of naked flesh, I am gonna spare your time. Don't watch it.
For all others, ""To burn the bridges"" is a moving, romantic, well acted film. I enjoyed it enormously.",1345334400,,666,4.467213114754099
8311573,4,B001IYURJ6,"Well made film on how teenagers of smaller cities and towns of Mexico deal with coming out.  The acting is good and the story is simple, but interesting.",1343088000,2,153,4.464285714285714
8311574,1,B001IYURJ6,"This SLICE OF LIFE movie was poorly acted, and had no plot or direction.  A waste of money, and time to sit and watch it expecting it might eventually pick up.  It didn't.",1327708800,,171,4.151515151515151
8311575,5,B001IYURJ6,"Surrounded by strong women and bullies, Sebastian (Angel Onesimo Nevarez) drifts on a cloud of his own. Not that the other characters don't have their dreams: his sister Helena (Irene Azuela) is learning English; his dying mother Eugenia (Claudette Maille) is lost in her days as a singer; schoolmate Juan (Bernardo Benitez) wants to go back home; and rich cousin Ismael (Ramon Valdes) tries to break free from round-the-clock bodyguard protection. But Sebastian's imagination is of a different dimension altogether:  Like Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) in ""Into the Wild,"" Sebastian's desire to escape transforms his surroundings and illuminates those that come into contact with him.

Angel Onesimo Nevarez is perfect as the silent, introverted Sebastian; Irene Azuela is stunning as his overcompensating sister. Even the baroque churches, paintings and cobblestone streets of Zacatecas, Mexico, appear to be dreaming under Francisco Franco's direction.",1286582400,6,962,5.767605633802817
