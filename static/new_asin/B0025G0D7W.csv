8351059,5,B0025G0D7W,"As is obvious, there are two movies on this.

The first seems to be a self promotion gimic for a few supermodels (perhap keen to get in to acting).  It is a fun, tongue-in-cheek James Bond rip-off action flick which is basically a means of showing off the fact that the leading ladies (the new Swedish Bikini Team) are absolutely gorgeous.  This gets the movie five stars.  Forget the plot (it is about foiling international terrorist bombers) forget the acting, watch the girls as they strut their stuff, bounce around and kick butt, ahd have a laugh.

The only star of note is John Rhys-Davies, and I assume he did it for fun because even he doesn't seem to take it seriously.

The other movie, the Prosecutor, is a complete waste of time.  They have put a bit of cleavage on the front cover, but there isn't any in the movie.  It isn't played for fun, and it isn't fun to watch.  Boring script, wooden acting, inept direction, unimaginative plot.  It comes across as a failed pilot for a 1970's TV show.  The plot involves prosecuting some crime figure, and the bad guys try to sabotage the trial by threats and kidnapping.

But you don't have to watch The Prosecutor.  Watch to other movie on the disc and be satisfied.

Just don't buy Never Say Never Mind from the Swedish Bikini Team web-site.  They didn't deliver, and wouldn't respond to my e-mails.",1288828800,,1357,4.549586776859504
