3628803,4,B001HBVE7Y,This fills in the gaps in understanding how widespread the anti-war movement was in the 1960s-70s. It ran deep in the armed forces forcing the American government to withdraw. FTA is the anti-USO show.,1376438400,3,201,4.9411764705882355
3628804,1,B001HBVE7Y,"The 60's are over and we who lived it are all old and almost gone. Nobody is watching us anymore and we don't have to pretend to be cool in order to fit in. I was a liberal once and I remember trying so hard to say the right things and look the right way and do all the right drugs. Then I got old and undesirable looking (got to be young right?) and for the first time in my life I started looking at things from the standpoint of their own merits. Is Vietnam under its current leadership the kind of country where people live in freedom with a fair and democratic government or is it run by a handful of so called Communists who divert all power and wealth to themselves? Was the Korean war a mistake? Is it bad that we were at least able to save half of the nation so that Koreans could live in freedom and prosperity or should we applaud the so called Communists of North Korea for starving and enslaving their people while a 28 year old spoiled deviant ruler threatens the world with nuclear holocaust? Do you really think for one minute that you would be happy living in China or Russia which despite improvements in standards of living still don't offer anywhere near the freedom we enjoy?  OK, I've said enough and now it's your turn to start throwing all your liberal turds at me but I think you're all shallow minded and so very fortunate you never had to eat the bitter fruit from the seeds you sowed.",1364515200,7,1412,4.24907063197026
3628805,4,B001HBVE7Y,"This film celebrates some forgotten history of the US Anti-War Movement.

During the US war against Vietnam, GI war resistors organized an active anti-war resistance movement within their own military organizations.  Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland (who played Hawkeye in the original M*A*S*H movie) were among those performers who toured the Pacific Rim to entertain and encourage GI war resistors.

The film contains some hard-hitting and vibrant performances, showcasing local grass-roots musicians and reminding us how music unites, supports and energizes popular resistance movements.",1359504000,6,590,6.0
3628806,5,B001HBVE7Y,Great snapshot of the mood and issues of anti-war servicemen and women during the Vietnam war.  The satire of the vaudeville style performances is first rate. Michael Alaimo shines as a comedic genius.  And Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland show the social change commitment in early years.,1348790400,3,289,5.127659574468085
3628807,5,B001HBVE7Y,"This is exactly the corrective to the view out there that the anti-war movement and the army were somehow different during the Vietnam era.  The army, like US society, was split.  To see the number of soldiers who attended these shows, and their laughter at the skits that mock the idiocy of their commanding officers, is to see that the movement against the war was inside and outside the army.  Is the content of the skits hilarious or inventive?  Not particularly.  But I would rather see this concrete evidence of solidarity with the soldiers from the anti-war movement than Bob Hope's silly jingoistic USO shows any day.  The ""F"" in the title, by the way, stands not for ""Free"" the Army, but for a rather more forceful verb.

The film also shows, incidentally, the not insignificant sexism in the subsequent vilification of Fonda from the right.  Why was there never the same level of vilification (which I would also have disagreed with) of Sutherland?  Sexism.

If you are interested in completing your view of the war and of the movement against it, this is a good place to go.

Gerald Nicosia's Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans' Movement is a history based on hundreds of interviews with men who fought in Vietnam and then came home to be active in the antiwar movement. The War Within: America's Battle Over Vietnam by Tom Wells is a comprehensive history of the antiwar movement, from its earliest days to the end of the war in 1975.

For an excellent history that focuses specifically on the GI rebellion during the war, read David Cortright's Soldiers in Revolt, republished by Haymarket Books.",1275264000,12,1969,4.801186943620178
3628808,2,B001HBVE7Y,This was a typical anti-vietnam war movie with Jane Fonda. I was curious as to its anti 1970's content. Watched the whole thing but to me it is not worth sharing with anyone.,1261180800,5,174,4.303030303030303
3628809,2,B001HBVE7Y,"Vietnam Era Veteran. Was unaware that this movie was ever made. I was a bit busy, at the time. Knew what I was getting, when I purchased the movie, although I wasn't aware that Donald Southerland shared the same views.
Political views were quite evident, but I was fighting for her right to say what she was saying, even though I might not have agreed with it. Some of it was funny to watch, but would not want to sit down and take the message seriously.",1237507200,5,454,4.290697674418604
3628810,3,B001HBVE7Y,"I'm thrilled this is out FINALLY, it's an interesting movie, certainly the original demonstration wouldn't have gone so smoothly had Sutherland and Fonda not been involved, but as far as entertainment value, it's forced and mixed to say the least. Maybe if Abbie Hoffman, Lenny Bruce or the Smothers Brothers Variety writers had been involved at this point, it would have been a wittier, more clever show. As it stands, it has the subtlety of an axe through a forehead. Since a similar high profile show with ""stars"" wasn't done to protest our last ten years of administration, I think FTA shows how much more guts people had then to fight for something they believed in, without fear of unpopularity or jail time.",1234656000,13,714,4.813008130081301
8308554,5,B001HBVE7Y,Great film!,1522195200,,11,5.0
8308555,2,B001HBVE7Y,"It is a documentary that is against the US involvement in the war in Vietnam by people who mostly don't understand the war in Vietnam. There were certainly legitimate reasons to oppose the US involvement. For one thing, the war enacted a draft that compelled people to fight against their will, unlike all the wars since then. I think morally it is justifiable to defend a sovereign country from a hostile take over by a repressive communist government backed by the Soviet Union and Communist China. However, it is also justifiable to question the wisdom of doing so, especially when there is no strategy to win the war. The worst part of this documentary of protest is that some of the participants actually believed that the communists in North Vietnam were more humane than America which was absolutely false. For instance, Jane Fonda said that prisoners in Hanoi were being treated humanely when in fact they underwent very cruel torture.",1518220800,,943,4.9

8308557,1,B001HBVE7Y,"It was one thing to be against the war in Vietnam. It is entirely another thing to openly espouse Marxist rhetoric, as this movie does. In one scene in the Philippines,  for example, at least 5 minutes were spent showing a communist march complete with interviews on the need for a Marxist revolution. All manner of Marxist buzzwords and beliefs were dropped by the wealthy, ignorant celebrities who have no idea what it would be like to actually live in a Stalinist society devoid of civil rights. It was probably good for Donald Southerland's career that this footage was lost for such a long time. Jane Fonda's career was severely damaged because of her commonly known beliefs.
As a Marine Corps veteran, I can only say I am totally ashamed by so many of the servicemen who had Anti-American beliefs.  The 60's generation is definitely in contention for the sorriest generation. I am sure many of them would have protested WW2 as well.",1493510400,,938,4.748466257668712
8308558,4,B001HBVE7Y,"Donald Sutherland had just made ""MASH"", Jane Fonda had just cut her hair but wasn't ""Hanoi Jane"" yet, but anyone who questions whether or not she supported the troops at the time should watch this and judge for themselves. The ""entertainment"" is dated but it seemed like their hearts were in the right place. Some of the soldiers they interview gave their honest insight at the time about a war they didn't choose to fight in, but some of what they say mirrors what soldiers today have said about wars we currently fight in. We still have cynical soldiers that ask ""what are we fighting  for?"". There is one tense moment with a drunk heckler stopping the show, but they seemed to have a lot of love and support from the audience. A lot of soldiers today on active duty would never be on camera speaking their mind against their leaders.",1424044800,3,836,4.5364238410596025
8308559,1,B001HBVE7Y,home movie.  Has historical value only.,1410480000,,39,5.5
8308560,3,B001HBVE7Y,"This important documentary about the antiwar movement during the Vietnam conflict is fascinating for uncovering hidden history of the resistance to the war and to U.S. imperialism in the Pacific Rim among the troops themselves.  We see soldiers in all their humanity as they react to their plight at being drafted or recruited to fight a war they did not believe in.  The FTA show was remarkable for the way it captured their disaffection and focused on specific issues that were creating their unrest at the time.

Unfortunately, the film gives only a fragmentary view of the show, which was put together by some very good writers and had top performers.  The coherence of the material is lost in the scattershot approach.  Only Donald Sutherland's riveting soliloquy at the finale gives a sense of the show's ability to deeply affect an audience.  Didactically, the film is good, covering a catalog of grievances, but missed the chance to show the power of theater, ""political vaudeville, as Jane Fonda called it, to spark social protest.  Fonda's 20 minute present day interview, reminiscing on the genesis of the show and its impact, if included on the disc, is almost better than the film itself for making the viewer understand what the experience was all about.",1408838400,3,1268,4.952830188679245
8308561,5,B001HBVE7Y,I had been wanting to see this movie for years. I was glad to finally find it on DVD. A must for all Jane Fonda fans.,1388534400,3,117,3.5384615384615383
8308562,5,B001HBVE7Y,This is an extremely important historical film. It features many interviews with soldiers stationed at different bases during the Vietnam war.  It shows how Jane Fonda and Paul Mooney along with many others tried to fight the hypocrisy  associated with the Vietnam war. They did. This with humorous skits poking fun  at different wartime situation. This film is an absolute must watch.,1380931200,3,385,5.17741935483871
8308563,3,B001HBVE7Y,"But the movie itself, subject matter, sucks big time. As a Vietnam Veteran, I have been aware of this drivel, but never had the chance to actually see it before. It should be seen by all to see just how wrong and misguided Hanoi Jane, Donald Sutherland and the rest were back then. Their vitriol towards all but those ready to desert is known and documented in this movie.",1379808000,3,372,4.405797101449275
