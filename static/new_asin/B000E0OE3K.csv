2476807,5,B000E0OE3K,"A few years back while at film school, I was trapped at a boring party where the host decided to drag out an old videotape that featured his version of Star Wars using his old action figures. It was so painful and boring that I swore Congress should enact laws banning such forms of entertainment.

When I heard about Robot Chicken, I braced myself for the worse. Thankfully I didn't write my senator.  Seth and his gang have created a fun spoof of things from the last 30 years using action figures and in many cases - real celeb voices. I've been glue to the show since it first hit Adult Swim. Hey that really is Joey Fatone trying to avenge his former boybanders' murders. It really is Scarlett Johansen dating the geek.

They keep the jokes coming in the 11 minute episodes so it doesn't get as boring as an episode of SNL. Sure not everthing clicks, but you don't have too long to wait for the next piece. Some may call this ""MTV"" style, but it's from Martin and Rowan's Laugh In even a bit of Dave Allen at Large.

I do have a lot of favorite moments, but the Shatner's wig saving the world is a medal winner.",1138060800,53,1116,4.274881516587678
2476808,5,B000E0OE3K,"I started reading ""Twisted Mego Theatre"" (Mego being the notoriously cheap-and-crappy line of barely-conceived comic book figures, most notably, the ""well-endowed"" Hulk figure.) back in 1997 in the pages of ToyFare at the tender and stupid age of 14. Who knew that 8 years of pleading and whining with God to get them their own show would happen?

Famous F.O.O.T. (Friends Of Ol' ToyFare) veteran Seth (Biggest Geek Award winner) Green and Matt Seinreich (hope I got his name right), as well as Editor-In-Chief of ToyFare Tom Root, all got together and (to be best of my knowledge) drank a whole bunch of alcohol smoked God-knows-what and decided that the completely screwed-up stories that appeared every month in ToyFare were meant for something better than 4 pages a month. The really diabolic thing is that Cartoon Network listened, producing a whole bunch of episodes that would have made the writers of Action! and Family Guy blanch. Don't believe me? Watch the Tooth Fairy episode and tell me nothing worse has ever been perpetrated on television.

After all of the geekdom that never got me any during High School, it is worth saying the following (in all capital letters):

IF YOU EVER SWIPED YOUR SISTER'S BARBIE DOLLS AND PLAYED ""SHORE LEAVE FOR G.I. JOE""!

IF YOU EVER CACKLED WHEN YOUR BUDDIES HAD SHREDDER AND KRANG GET MARRIED!

IF YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT FARTS, MURDER, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BEING A SLACKER WERE HILARIOUS! Note: You probably also think George Carlin and Denis (f***ing) Leary are funny. (In other words, one of my kind)

SEE HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I!

(and Robot Chicken)

P.S.: Green! Seinrich! Root! Will we ever get to see the funny-as-hell (and the most prolific piece of Twisted ToyFare Theatre) Spider-Man, Hulk and Thor misadventures?

(Also, you can get the Twisted ToyFare Theatre collections here on Amazon! BUY THEM ALL!)",1137801600,,1867,4.958333333333333

2476810,5,B000E0OE3K,"I just wanted to write this review because the only review of this show is actually wrong. The show isn't claymation, it's stop motion action figures. The orgins of this show actually stem from two things: the mad scientist scenario is an homage to MST3K and the actual programs are an extension of a feature titled ""Twisted Toyfare Theater"" in a magazine entitled Toyfare. Okay, now that I have clarified these miscrepancies, on to an actual review. The shows aren't exactly peabody award winners, but if you're like me and grew up in the 70's and 80's you'll get a good chuckle out of seeing your favorite action figures in hilarious and sometimes compromising positions. My main problem with the show was that the episodes are only 13 minutes long. Something like this definitely needs to be upgraded to a half hour at least. If you're a fan of Family Guy and it's ilk, give this show a good look, but if you are easily offended, steer clear. It's definitely not a kid's show.",1135814400,30,979,4.632183908045977

2476828,4,B000E0OE3K,"This is one of those shows you'll likely either love or hate with an equal passion.  I bought the first three seasons used for literally pennies on the dollar, so I really cannot complain. Will you like this show? Hmmm... Let me clarify your tastes by asking you this: Did you enjoy Revenge of the Nerds, the old Batman show, Napoleon Dynamite, Sigmund & The Sea Monsters, The G.I. Joe Adventure Team, Celebrity Death Match, SuperFriends, and Manimal? If you loudly screamed ""Yes!"" to any or all of these then first, get some help! Second, place your order right now for Season One since, IMHO, you are fully-primed to thoroughly enjoy the twisted genius that is ROBOT CHICKEN. If you turned up your nose or rolled your eyes at any of the above-listed titles then do yourself a favor and steer clear. No genre or topic is left un-riffed. A bunch of guys take toys from their youth and use crude stop-motion animation to make the figures come to life, creating funny (often hilarious) skits in a raunchy SNL style that's sure to please those who haven't lost their inner child and can fully enjoy a good fart joke now & then without being ashamed. >>>But please note that this show is ripe with scatological & sexual humor and contains some harsh (F-bombs included) language, so it is most definitely NOT for young kids, despite the toy/action figure look of the show.<<< The episodes contained in Season 1 are in good shape on this DVD collection.

2476839,4,B000E0OE3K,"Robot Chicken is a stop-motion animated sketch show based on the premise of a mad scientist turning a chicken into a cyborg and forcing it to watch short movies. The shorts run the gamut of scenarios and hilarity, from gags of just a couple of seconds to spoofs lasting most of the show's average eleven minute runtime. Some of them fall flat, but the longer sketches trend toward greatness. Abide by the MA rating: despite being stop-motion animated, this show is most definitely not for children. A great deal of the humor is aimed at people who remember cartoons created to sell toy lines. Season one has some chestnuts for the ages, like a super race spoof in episode 3, or the martial arts contest parody in episode 9. If you like season one, chances are you'll like the rest of the series too.",1405296000,,799,4.555555555555555

2476841,4,B000E0OE3K,"Robot Chicken was fun for a VERY brief time, meaning the first season and then it died. This is just my opinion, but the first season is excellent, and a funny concept that seemed like it could possibly go on, not for more than 3 or 4 seasons though. I recommend this first season if you like the type of shows that are on Adult Swim, it's one of their better ones in my opinion, this Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Harvey Birdman.

It's pretty much the perfect show for a guy staring forty in the face and still refusing to give up his cartoons or action figure collecting.  It's bawdy, it's quick, and it makes inside jokes for those of us who bask in the joy of refusing to get old and boring.

Also, if you have ever liked an actor who is working now, Seth Green has probably gotten them to come make fun of themselves and/or the characters they have played.  For me, the insanely long list of A-listers who have a sense of humor about themselves reads like a list of actors that have earned my money in their future endeavors.",1366761600,,634,4.3474576271186445

The only minor problem is that because of the young age of its creators
their material is often geared at young adults. Yes they do touch subjects

2476910,1,B000E0OE3K,"Robot Chicken is not, as an Amazon review says, a mixture of Laugh In and KaBlam!. It would be if someone other than Seth Green had made it, but those shows, to their eternal credit, were PG rated, and Robot Chicken is not. Any truly creative souls can work within the limits and boundaries of a G or PG rating. Look at Lucille Ball. Robot Chicken is the latest in the decline and fall of Cartoon network and Adult Swim. What began as very creative, post-modern humor, with Williams Street and Space Ghost, has steadily declined with its loss of innocence.

It happened with Ren and Stimpy, which started as innovative and creative with John K., went to hades after Nick fired said creator, and ended in the unwatchable mess on Spike TV. It happened with Futurama, which began as one of the most creative and brilliant creations in the history of animation, and gathered a cult following on Cartoon Network, and then unbelievably made a movie for Comedy Central, which was cut into four parts, Bender's Big Score and three others.

It's still very surprising that Star Wars would allow itself to be associated with either the Robot Chicken or Family Guy parodies, since Star Wars is the PG movie that brought people back to the theaters. They were empty before that. Or have the studios forgotten that? Have they forgotten that it's the family audience that revived movies, TV, video (they bought VHS longer than anyone else did), and provided all the non-pornography support for on demand movies? Do studios still not see how eager they are for old TV to come out on DVD? Do the shirts really not know why? If you really can't make imaginative PG and G rated TV and movies, get out of the business. You don't belong there. Go and make trash which you glorify with the name pornography. Do you really go to bed at night telling yourself you're making a diffference by selling condoms? How about abstinence?

But don't be surprised if this audience stops going to movies and quits watching your shows. When they start voting, it will be no. And don't be surprised if someday someone gets into places like Cartoon Network and starts making real TV with PG and G ratings and shows you how it's done.",1225584000,5,2196,4.625641025641026
2476911,5,B000E0OE3K,"This show is an ingenius and hilarious collection of skits that parody pop culture of recent and many years before with excellent stop-motion animation and clay animation done by action figures and puppets. It is created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich as it brings toys to life on the small screen in ways you can't imagine. This is one of AdultSwim's most popular and creative shows as it's sort of a animated version of SNL, MADTV or Monty Python but made for adults even to the child of the 80's and 90's who can recongize the references and characters.

On this first season we got 20 episodes with nifty skits like my personal faves ""Great Pumpkin"" with Charlie Brown and the gang getting murdered by the one creature Linus worships so much on Halloween, the ""Smurfs"" parody on ""Se7en"" and "" A look at where is Dr. Teeth and The Band"". I also love how they would do a ""Diary of Ann Frank"" starring Hillary Duff, this is one of the funniest shows i've ever seen even to Retro people as well.

This DVD contains a bunch of great extras like deleted scenes including an extended version ""Smufs Se7en"", deleted animatics, photo gallery, animation meetings, alternate audio takes, Promos, Bumps, Commentaries, Animatic to episode comparision, wire comparisions, behind the scenes and Sweet J presents skits.",1220572800,,1311,4.79646017699115
2476922,5,B000E0OE3K,"Indeed, that is what you will say, if you've never seen Robot Chicken before.  On the surface, each episode seems like crudely done stop motion animation--but delve a little deeper.  The real magic is in the tightly written (and gloriously gloriously violent!!) episodes that revel in the non-sequitor and the from way way out of left field references you may pick up on.  A typical episode has two main running stories that last about 3-5 minutes with a veritable crapload of Laugh-In style gags thrown in.  If you are expecting high-brow humor, it will be there, but this show is more akin to the Family Guy with jokes that run the gamit of being surreal and obscure to very crude (fart/vomit/and sex scenes abound).  Although I'm not partial to fart jokes, there is a really good skit about what happens when Mikey gets ahold of a pop rocks and soda.  My favorite skits:  The Great Pumpkin Skit--Linus's reaction shot after he conjures his pumpkin has to be seen to be believed!  The Smurf murder mystery--complete with all those annoying Smurfin' references  The Bloopers--these can get very out of control!  As for extras, each episode has a commentary track to it.  In fact, my advice is to watch two or three episodes one day and then watch them again the next day with the commentary playing.  It's not exactly revelatory, but Seth and Matt should get their kudos for giving each episode (all 20 of them!) their personal attention.  The Pros for this set:  deleted scenes for many of the skits, uncensored puppet violence, and a very reasonable price tag (I paid $13 and it was worth every cent!)  The Cons:  the commentary tracks tend to ramble and not make much sense sometimes; the worst:  the censored dialogue--I don't know if the bleeping was intended by Seth and Matt, but I was expecting an uncensored version like what Family Guy gives you:  I mean, come one, it would have been worth it to hear Pokemon really going off.....",1220140800,,1942,4.712166172106825
2476923,5,B000E0OE3K,"this dvd set is great, the price is the best anywhere, even better than the price of both seasons together at this site (season 1 and 2 seperate are cheaper thant hte box set).  It is so funny becuase its so fast paced, joke joke joke. they make sure they do the best work even if its a 15 min show.  I was totally hooked and bought both seasons after just seeing 1 eposode! Of course not having the Star Wars Episode in this sucks, but the star wars DVD that just came out is awesome itself, and has lots of extras to make it worth getting alone.",1217462400,,547,4.055555555555555
2476924,3,B000E0OE3K,I watched a couple of episodes on TV... and laughed a lot.. decided to get the two set CD..... watched CD 1 for a while... laughed a little...CD 2 (this one) is just as up and down..  but really think this cd should be watched with a group of people... some of it is funny..  some not so funny... I feel that I could have spent my money elsewhere for better value..,1216080000,3,365,4.055555555555555

All 20 episodes on this 2 dvd set are great and this dvd set is only the beggining of the insanity on Robot Chicken. Honestly i liked this season more than season two and season three i didn't catch too much off but thats not the point. if you love insane humor and adult swim than buy this dvd set today",1215475200,,448,4.160919540229885
2476926,5,B000E0OE3K,"that's really all i can say to sum up this show with comedic and downright funny episodes.  While they don't last long, it doesnt really need to with everything that's working in this show.  No issue or person is taboo or left alone.  It really has to be seen to believe just how all this happens and is put together to make a show that while very violent is still so freakin funny.  That you can help but to laugh out loud at all that's happening here.

With many featurettes, deleted scenes and how this show came about along with several different would be names for the show and also some ads plugging the Robot Chicken show.  It's all that and a Robot Chicken.",1211846400,,665,4.32258064516129
2476927,5,B000E0OE3K,"If you watch Adult Swim, you have seen Robot Chicken, 11 minute stretch of rapid fire sketch jokes, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes.  Seth Green and Co.  use a lot of pop culture satire, taking toys from the last 20 years and throwing them into improbable situations.  The nice thing about the DVD is that if you are interested in more than 11 minutes of this type of entertainments, you can keep watching.  Plus, some of the scenes are fun to pause on.",1211673600,,465,4.310344827586207
2476928,1,B000E0OE3K,"I've seen many of this shows episodes simply because I love Adult Swim overall.  I have to say that of all the comedy shows on Adult Swim I find all of them at least slightly amusing except this one.  You can say I don't get it, but I love other shows that some people think are awful (Tim and Eric).  Every joke in this show is predictable.  I've tried to look deeper into the jokes to see if I'm missing something but I don't think so.  Seth Green is not funny.  This show is just plain awful.  The writing (and voice acting) is what makes it so bad.  It's like I know what is coming in every scene before it happens, and when it does happen it happens in the most unfunny way possible.  How did Seth Green ever become famous?",1209513600,6,728,4.1063829787234045
2476929,5,B000E0OE3K,"i enjoy this show. it's funny... i want to say it's like an r rated simpsons, but it's more arbitrary and it mocks things more openly. i'm guaranteed at least one chuckle per episode and though sometimes i feel like one or two skits are trying too hard, for the most part it's a great way to pass the time. i like that a lot of the skits are short (like the flipping of the channels they show in the beginning) because any longer and they'd loose their appeal, so cudos to the writers on that one, and sadly i enjoy that it promotes the short attention span because i like thinking, a lot, but sometimes a break's nice. and finally i like what they mock and i think they do a good job of it.",1209513600,,691,4.088235294117647
2476930,5,B000E0OE3K,"Robot Chicken is awesome. I'm not sure what else to say about it. It is a show that takes a lot of work to make and the results reflect this. One thing I love about the dvd is the bonus features. The parts where Seth Green acts out the episodes are really funny.

Part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim these short sketches are nothing short of comedic genius. From G.I. Joe parodies which is my favorite one, to Calvin and Hobbes they dabble in a little bit of everything from past and present pop culture. If you have not been tuning in to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and you are a fan of Family Guy Cartoons and Sick and Funny Animated Shorts, then buy this DVD and you will not regret it.",1191715200,,611,4.368421052631579

2476950,5,B000E0OE3K,"This is great! This is the best thing I've seen Cartoon Network do. Seth Green is a warped genius. This is madness in it's purest form.

Robot Chicken is a sketch show that uses action figures and various dolls to act out scenes in stop motion animation. It's only fifteen minutes long and only airs once a week but it's great fun. It's so completely random that you have no idea what's going to happen next. Nothing is sacred. Adult Swim has a real gem with this one.

This show is fun. It's like watching a mad man play with his old childhood toys. You can't help but look as you see Seth Green's sick imagination unfold bizarre and comedic situations for several famous characters with their action figure counter parts. Various celebrities lend their voices. I hope this show lasts a good long while.",1186704000,2,804,4.537931034482758

2476955,4,B000E0OE3K,"Who'd've thought that watching puppeteers' work could be funny again?  Who'd've thought Seth Green could help make such a funny show?  Well, whether his putting his name on the show brought more attention to it or if he actually helped the peeps with the animation, to me it's a moot point, as this was actually entertaining, and if I lose my copy, I'll be purchasing another, it really is very funny, in an adult sort of way.  Superhero dolls dancing on tables, and my personal favorite, ""Kill Bunny"" in the style of ""Kill Bill""... hilarious...

If you have a few extra dollars and want to laugh with some friends maybe, get this and send them home laughing!",1176163200,,659,4.6068376068376065

2476958,1,B000E0OE3K,"If you take the toys we loved from the 80's and animate them in short, stop-motion pop-culture parodies of everything from Kill Bill to American Idol, throw in voices like Mark Hamill, Phyllis Diller, Christian Slater, Hulk Hogan, Ashton Kutcher, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth MacFarlane, and music by Les Claypool, how could it possibly go wrong? Adult Swim's Robot Chicken will show you how.

They've secretly replaced the humor with a barrage of bowel movements, flatulence, and more bowel movements.  Let's see if you can spot the difference.  Apparently there are some who can't.  There's nothing wrong with crude humor (as this show claims to have) but Seth Green and Co. just add an extra helping of 'crude' to cover up the fact that there's little to no humor.

One scene opens with Skeletor, Mumm-Ra, Cobra Commander, and Lex Luthor sitting in a car together, stuck in traffic.  In this scenario, anything that happened would be hilarious.  Anything EXCEPT Skeletor farting and forcing the other villians to smell it.  Brilliant, right? Right?

So if you love super heroes but have always wanted to see them sitting on the toilet, then Robot Chicken is for you.  Otherwise, stick with the Simpsons for pop-culture parodies that are actually funny.  Maybe Seth Green should stick to doing voices and just play with his toys on the toilet at home to his heart's content.  And possibly think about some therapy.  Can anyone really be this obsessed with going to the bathroom?.",1169683200,14,1480,4.94331983805668

2477000,5,B000E0OE3K,"I was totally unaware of this show until it popped up in a recommedations from Amazon (I don't have cable or dish TV, so I don't see Cartoon Network).  The price at the time was good, it sounded funny, so I took a chance.

Sure glad I did.  The episodes are only 15 minutes or so long. Each contains quite a few ""skits"" varying from 5 seconds to about 3 minutes long.  It's all animated unbelievably crudely, and that's part of the charm.  It's all about the twisted combinations of action figures with story lines.  And a great voice cast.  For example, a favorite of mine was KILL BUNNY.  What do you do with a Jesus action figure?  A spoof of the trailer for Kill Bill, of course.  When Jesus heals Daryl Hannah, instead of plucking her other eye out, I thought I'd keel over laughing.

Not every skit is a winner.  No one will like them all.  But they go by so fast, that even the clunckers (An A-Team spoof seems redundant) only take a minute of your time.  These are great to watch when you have limited time, need a quick pick-me-up, or have a large group of people over who can't concentrate on anything too long.

Also, anything that has music by Les Claypool automatically takes a step UP in the cool department.  It's not the greatest thing since sliced bread, doesn't hold a candle to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, but it is funny.  If you want funny...you get it.  If you want genius, a high budget and uncanny special effects...keep looking.",1167955200,2,1447,4.437262357414449
2477001,5,B000E0OE3K,"Imagine the most random, twisted, bizarre, disturbing, warped situations that you could possibly think of. Multiply that by 100. Now imagine that acted out by action figures.

This is Robot Chicken, by far one of the most disturbing yet unbelievably hilarious television shows ever produced. Words cannot begin to do justice to the insanity Seth Green and company churn out.

Not all of the episodes hit the mark, but the episodes that do hit the mark, hit the mark HARD. Some of the most surreal things I've ever seen.

The weak concept of this show is to take celebrities and cultural icons and to animate them with claymation (edit: ""stop motion animation,"" to be more precise and inclusive), then to put them in unexpected situations, often pitting them violently against one another (yes, derivative of ""Celebrity Deathmatch,"" and probably even less entertaining).  The end result can be described by nothing more flattering than ""obscene slapstick.""  It takes slapstick to a ridiculous extreme, as if slapstick wasn't already ridiculous enough.  If you're into lowbrow humor, you'll love Robot Chicken.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself using the DVD as a coaster (if you can resist the temptation to smash it into pieces with a hammer).  Seriously, you can't find a single scene that doesn't rely on something gratuitously vulgar, violent, or potentially offensive.  The laziest ""humor"" around.

To clarify, my disgust of this series is not in its mature or even its offensive content, but rather in its blatantly juvenile humor (using the term ""humor"" loosely).  Imagine yourself at the age of 13 while your parents are asleep, defiantly basking in the cesspool of cheap, risque, late-night comedy.

there's just something realistic(in context at least) of Skeletor, the antagonist from the He-Man cartoon of my youth, locking the windows during his carpool to work and letting a silent but deadly loose while they are stuck in traffic. ""that was a good one!"" he says to the confusion of his carpooling band of 1980's villains. the confusion doesn't last long as they all desperately battle for freedom from the foul confines of the sealed vehicle.

i know someone gave this a one star rating. that same person, in their other reviews, claimed that Beethoven was not an appropriate movie for kids (you know, the kid's movie about the dog...) and that leonardo dicaprio shouldn't make R rated mmovies because 'she is in love with him.'

2477052,5,B000E0OE3K,"One of the most popular and by far the shortest shows on Cartoon Network, ROBOT CHICKEN is a series of sketches (running about 12 minutes each) that uses action figures and other toys in stop-motion animation to skewer pop culture:  movies, television shows, commercials, famous novels, politics, American History, amusement parks, current events, music, and more get parodied in this first season.  The sketches happen rather quickly with jokes (some witty, some not) flying out at a rate that someone with ADD would have a hard time keeping up with.  What's even more amazing is that many of the original actors perform for the show: Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker; Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise host a road race between famous toy-toons; Scarlett Johansen as herself in a ""win-a-date-with"" spoof; etc.

Some of my favorite sketches on this DVD set include the ""Kill Bunny"" parody where Jesus hunts down the Easter Bunny KILL BILL-style; the ""The Great Pumpkin"" where the Peanuts gang discovers that ""The Great Pumpkin"" is a real horror monster that eats the flesh of children; the Smurfs sketch that parodies the movie SEVEN; the sketch where the real Michael Jackson returns to Earth from space to fight the fake Michael Jackson; the road race that is hosted by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise; and the A-TEAM parody.  There are all sorts of other sketches, but these are some of my favorites.

Extras on the set include commentaries on all the episodes (some of these are interesting, but apparently they made all these commentaries in one day so there are certain points that are rather dull and repetitive--you find out everything you could possibly want to know about the opening sequence where the road-kill chicken is brought back to life), deleted scenes, some original SWEET J Presents sketches, behind the scenes featurette, wire comparisons of some of the sketches, animatic to episode comparisons of a few sketches, a photo gallery, sample of animation meetings, alternate audio takes, tv promos, and several Cartoon Network bumps.",1157500800,6,2043,5.065476190476191

The Wire Comparisons bit was interesting for some of the ""How Did They *Do* That?"" stuff. A lot of the deleted stuff was rightfully deleted, though there are some interesting bits in the ""director's cut"" of  Smurfs/Se7en.

Be sure to catch the Animation Meetings bits where Seth Green acts out some of the scenes. Comedy gold, especially him doing the voices and movements for the boy and his whored-out sister for ""Pimp My Sister"" and acting out the parts in ""Easter Bunny.""

They could have left the Bumps and Promos off without me missing them at all.

2477072,5,B000E0OE3K,"Created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich, Robot Chicken is a blast of pop culture irreverance.  Comprised of skits starring action figures and toys, Robot Chicken is often inspired, and frequently tear inducing hilarious, sheer comic bliss that is the highlight of the Adult Swim lineup.  Those who grew up in the 80's in particular will find much to laugh about here, as the Transformers, Voltron, He-Man, the Thundercats, the Dukes of Hazzard, Star Trek, Star Wars, and many more are spoofed in ways you'll never forget; especially Autobot leader Optimus Prime and his battle with prostate cancer.  There's also skits spoofing more recent pop culture, such as the Kill Bill-spoofing Kill Bunny in which Jesus Christ slices his way through Santa Claus and a roomful of sword wielding Jews in an effort to take revenge on the Easter Bunny.  There's also Mark Hamil voicing Luke Skywalker and walking off the set of Empire Strikes Back as Darth Vader reveals all the twists to come in the Star Wars universe.  There's more standouts, including the pop-sicle stick production of Debbie Does Dallas, a Blooper show in which the host frequently commits suicide, and a look at what the eighth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer would have been.  The cast of the theatrical version of Scooby Doo meet their demise when they investigate Camp Crystal Lake and meet hockey mask killer Jason Voorhees, and there's also a very funny and lengthy skit where the members of N*Sync are killed, leaving Joey Fatone (who voices himself) alive and seeking revenge under the training of the late Pat Morita.  There's a host of guest voices throughout the first season of Robot Chicken, including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mila Kunis, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, Scarlet Johansson, Erika Christensen, Amy Smart, Topher Grace, Ashton Kutcher, Wilmer Valderamma, Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachel Leigh Cook, Dax Shepard, and Breckin Meyer; all of which help make the show something special.

-

Twisted - Check!

Demented - Check!

Funny - Check!

Highly Entertaining - Check!

THE PREMISE, a mad scientist makes a robot chicken, brainwashes the chicken and forces it to watch non-stop, countless hours of TV, the sketches that we see, are apparently a conglomeration of what the Chicken's Brain has registered.

-Sound odd? Indeed it does....

Seriously, Robot Chicken, is fantastically, well thought out, sketch comedy using cartoons, toys and references which any child of the 80's (like myself) will enjoy.  It is done in Start/Stop animation and hysterically funny... poking fun at such characters as Scooby Doo, Transformers, He-Man, Volton and then some more modern characters like the Olson Twins and Hilary Duff.

Overall there is just too much going on to really attempt to describe it, Just watch this, reminisce, laugh and enjoy.

Seth Green and his co-conspirators have cooked up an inspired melange of spoofs (I think my favorites had to be the Cannonball Run and Real World: Metropolis bits) and short, often Monty Pythonesque bits, all done in stop motion animation with what often appear to be modified off-the-shelf action figures.  Along the way they take on cultural icons as disparate as Gandhi, the Olsen twins, Voltron and the A-Team.  The extras are worth a view and the DVD allows you to slow down and catch bits in backgrounds and crowded shots you might otherwise miss.  The episodes are 15 minutes each which are a perfect length, great for a quick laugh but nothing goes on overly long.

It is a monthly panel based humor story using superhero Mego figures and other toy line dolls to create some wild and hilarious situations.  There are six volumes of collected stories available over a [...]  ""Robot Chicken"" was inspired by these great stories.  So, if you like the series, I highly recommend checking them out and reading Toyfare Magazine each month.

As for the Cartoon Network series, it is really enjoyable.  There are too many scat and peeing jokes in my opinion, but everything else is laugh-out-loud funny.  I'm not exactly sure, but I think Matt Henreich (writer and producer with Seth Green) was once a staff member with Toyfare Magazine and worked on the TTT series.  So his comic view with figures gives the groundwork for the ""Robot Chicken"" show.  If you loved ""Toy Story"" and had fun blowing up or just finding ways to destroy your figures/dolls in your youth or just came up with crazy situations to play with them in, then ""Robot Chicken"" is perfect entertainment.  This is not comedy for kids.  The series is very adult oriented.

I don't just watch 1 episode and judge it. I carefully examine each episode before I make my decission...",1142899200,11,838,4.276729559748428
2477091,5,B000E0OE3K,"Normally, I wouldn't address the idiocy of a reviewer's comments, simply because I feel that everybody is entitled to their own opinion. However, ""S. Alix"" and his ""the show is getting better with every season"" comment needs to be addressed. Fine, you don't like the show. Fine, you feel the show ""reeks of desperation."" But who are you to say that the show is getting better ""with every season?"" Numbnuts: the second season will not aire until April 2nd. Considering you don't even know what season the show is in, I will shrug your comments off as the random drivel that they truly are.",1142899200,2,588,4.663461538461538
2477092,5,B000E0OE3K,"Ever since this show first premiered on Adult Swim, I've wanted the DVD! With classics like ""Voltron Got Served"", ""This is Your Brain..."", and ""Enter the Fat One"" (which I'm watching now), this series is a must-have! Skits like those make the show hilarious, but what makes it so great is the voice talent by actors Seth Green, Macaulay Culkin, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mila Kunis, and a lot of other surprising guest appearances. (I hate that the end credits run by so fast because I want to see whose voices were on that night's show.) Any fan of Adult Swim should have this is their video library!",1142726400,3,598,4.598130841121495
2477093,4,B000E0OE3K,"The topics and humor in this show come fast and in a highly random manner, which may not appeal to everyone, but if you like the old 1-minute ""blackout"" type of sketches done years ago on many variety shows, then Robot Chicken will appeal to you. If a gag misses the mark for you it will be over fast and the next one will be rolling by moments later, a gag that may be very different and a lot funnier to you. There's something for everyone, as pop-culture, politics and more are skewered using action figures and other models in a rapid parade of stop-motion comedy sketches. My personal favorites are those that use action figures from some popular cartoon, comic book or movie, placing them in character in situations where they are forced to deal with everyday frustrations and problems. It's bust-a-gutt funny when you see Lex Luthor and Skeletor stuck in traffic, Transformers suffering from severe chronic illnesses, and more. There's also a hilarious bit where a stop-motion Mark Hamill (who voices himself) walks off the set of Star Wars after Darth Vader spouts a string of the most improbable explanations of how things work in Star Wars mythology. Many other actors and well-known personalities provide guest voices on the show, often poking fun at themselves or work they have done in the past.

Robot Chicken Vol. 1 is funny enough to warrant repeated viewing and I'm looking forward both to buying this DVD set and to seeing the second season of the show which begins in April 2006.",1142467200,43,1498,4.739463601532567
2477094,2,B000E0OE3K,"I admire what Seth and company are trying to do with this show but at times it just reeks of desperation to get any kind of a laugh out of you. You may get one quality skit in its 11 minute time span. The show is getting better with every season but this first season shows that they didn't quite figure out what they were trying to do.

Their are some inspired skits but not enough to warrant a purchase for this other wise sub par adult swim show.",1142467200,5,449,4.044943820224719
2477095,5,B000E0OE3K,"I really enjoy the fact that this product hasn't come out yet and people are already writing reviews on it.  The only comparison I can draw from is watching the show itself on CN.  The show is not quite as racey as up-and-comers like Moral Orel however the show does put a wonderful spin on (in most cases) 15 seconds of WTF???

As a recreational viewer of ""Adult Swim"", Cartoon Network's afterhours mature audience programming, I would often catch myself staying up late to watch the 15 minute Micro-show (as long as it wasn't on 3 hours later!).  Robot chicken is a brutal slap in the face for what alot of America has on it's mind.  So long as you aren't a ""super-conservative"" most people find themselves slapping their knee at least once an episode.  I am definitly going to pick this one up the day it comes out!",1142380800,2,818,4.456375838926174
2477096,4,B000E0OE3K,I never thought this series would be any good but it was really funny. There is nothing normal about Robot Chicken but the best way to define it is the what if game you play with your friends when you're in a really dumb mood. You know when you say to somebody hey what if there is really two Mike Jackson's and one is an alien and the other was abducted or hey what if Transformers had a break dance competition with the alien. One of my favorites would have to be Alien's daughter dating Predator's son. This is an ok show and it certainly is nothing like anything out on TV right now.,1140566400,2,587,4.157894736842105
2477097,5,B000E0OE3K,"I have always said it takes absolute genius to create utter stupidity. 'Robot Chicken' proves that I am right. This is a show that has everything a avid television fan could ever want. It captures the essence of everything television is about, from channel surfing to reality tv and it is shown through stop motion camera. Yep, you don't need extremely expensive effects to creat good television. All you need is a ton of clay and a bunch of old action figures and barbie dolls. Then have them all do things from going on space adventures, have them lured by satan to do nothing but watch TIVO, and yes go at it on the dinning room table in their trailer park home. What could be any better?

What is so great about this show is that it wanted to capture the very essance of television in modern society. Yes, that is extremly far fetched but if you think about it its true. Each episode only lasts about 10 minutes and is basically the day in the life of someone flipping through channels. The show says whatever it wants to say and everything you never had the guts to say. This is a must have for all those with a sick sence of humor and love for anything pop culture. But please don't try any of the things you see on this show at home. In other words....DON'T PUT THE BABY IN THE BULDOZER!",1138752000,8,1294,4.325102880658436
