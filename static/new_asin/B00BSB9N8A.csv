However, the intro song is not the regular one they had when it played on Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid.  That was also something I was okay with.  Then they have some of the shorter episodes combined with other ones so they have 2 episodes for each chapter when you watch it.  The problem here is that it doesn't allow you to go to the point in the episode where you want.  You have to watch it from beginning to end without stopping or you run the risk of it starting back at the beginning.  It may be my computer but I don't have this problem with any other DVD I own.  Also, I pressed pause and then came back to watch the episode and it took me back to the beginning of the chapter.  It didn't do this every time but it was a random feature and if I fast forwarded it, sometimes it would play where I stopped fast forwarding and sometimes it would take me back to the beginning;  again, another random feature.  Very frustrating",1420848000,4,1108,4.083333333333333
