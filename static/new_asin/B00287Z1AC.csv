8355947,4,B00287Z1AC,"I bought the entire DVD series from Amazon and the product looked good. It was used, so the packaging was slightly damaged but the DVDs looked fine. They were gifts, and since I gave them away without testing them, I can only hope they work. If they don't, you will hear from me in a revised review.",1314489600,,299,4.2631578947368425
8355948,5,B00287Z1AC,"Hunter X Hunter is one of my favorite shows, and the English dubbing on this is good enough you don't need to use subtitles.",1293321600,,124,4.208333333333333
8355949,5,B00287Z1AC,"this has been an excellent series.

With great characters, fighters of various styles and of course.  The main course being the Hunter Exam which we find it involves two parts.  The ""second"" part is the mastering of nen.  Which is a skill(power) that the hunters use in a variety of ways throughout their Hunter career some are better at it than others. Hunter X Hunter is a very solid show that continues to evolve as more of the back story unfolds.

I can't wait for the next volume.",1263168000,,485,4.465909090909091

8355951,4,B00287Z1AC,"Thought I'd post up this info as almost everywhere lacks it or has it incorrect (even Viz's own site).

Box Set contains episodes 31-46. 16 episodes instead of the normal 15 to even out the extra two that come from the total 62 episodes.

Also, Viz has decided to completely remove ending two from the show and instead continue using the first ending. Total drag... as ending one is terrible.

Box 3 finishes up the Hunter Exam and then has a one episode ""cool off"" at the end before one of the best arcs of the series starts up. Definitely can't wait for the final box in December.",1250035200,6,582,4.37037037037037
8355952,4,B00287Z1AC,"Train, train, train. Fight, fight, fight. ""Hunter x Hunter Volume 3"" is all about training and fighting -- whether it's to get money, a friend, or a long-awaited duel with one's nemesis (who turns out to be even creepier than we first thought). It gets a bit tedious when our prepubescent heroes spend several episodes learning how to use their hidden superpowers, but it seems to be pretty important -- and sparks off a new arc.

Determined to get Killua back, Gon and his buddies head for Mt. Kukura, the home of the Zoldyck family -- only to discover that it's a nearly impenetrable fortress guarded by a vast man-eating canine and deadly preteen butlers. And after training to get inside without being killed, the gang encounters the biggest obstacle of all: Killua's mother. But the deciding factor in this fight over Killua's fate is his enigmatic father.

Then the boys split off from Kurapika and Leorio for the next six months. Since they're broke, they head off to the Heaven's Arena to make some money by fighting; with Gon's newly-minted strength, they rapidly shoot up the Tower. They also encounter a young martial-artist named Zushi and his master Wing, who teaches them about the aura-utilizing techniques of ""nen"" -- which are essential for a Hunter. Unfortunately, Hisoka has followed them to the Tower, intent on a fight with Gon.

And in the meantime, Kurapika is also learning about nen, but his quest and his powers have a much darker purpose, and he's willing to risk far more to accomplish his goal. He's even determined to give up his friends.

The first arc in ""Hunter x Hunter Volume 3"" is obviously all about ripping Killua back from his assassin family, and becoming strong enough that they even merit the family's notice. And the second is about the two boys learning how to become more powerful -- not only do they become more experienced in hand-to-hand combat, but they start learning all about the required superhuman powers that a shonen anime has to have. Lots of talking about aura and

It gets a bit tedious when the boys are doing stuff like meditating or messing with water glasses, but the writers inject some fun running gags (Killua's constant torture of the high-strung elevator girl). It's far more interesting when they are learning to be stronger and utilizing their power in fights, and there's a pretty even balance of action and comic relief (such as the ""slippers"" scene, or Killua breaking the bank with all the chocolate he can find).

And the action becomes pretty hardcore near the end, although Hisoka's fight with Kastro is  fragmented enough to give you seizures (and the gruesome aftermath is hidden behind potted plants). But there's also some exquisitely ghastly imagery in the last episode -- Kurapika bound in his own vinelike chains, floating in a red sea, or walking alone through the rainy streets.

Boy-assassin Killua gets the most development in this volume: without his family casting a shadow over him, he becomes a lot more amusing and quirky. And Gon finally gets his fight with Hisoka, who turns out to be even more of a freaky fight-pervert than we ever expected (he gets very doe-eyed when Gon is pummeling him), as well as a few new revelations about what he does when he's not stalking little boys. And we briefly see into the depths of Kurapika's desire for vengeance -- which seems to be at the start of a NEW arc.

""Hunter X Hunter Volume 3"" is most concerned with training, fighting, and wresting Killua from his ""loving"" family. And although the teaching-about-nen subplot is a bit dull, the new storyline promises to be interesting.",1246406400,2,3616,4.809983896940419
