8606145,2,B00EJUXNAG,Movies are very hard to understand unless you are from Britain or Ireland.  No closed captioning. There were a couple of movies I enjoyed. Hitchcocks later films were much more enjoyable.,1487721600,,187,5.032258064516129

8606150,5,B00EJUXNAG,Not Hitchcock's best. But some of his earlier work. It will be good to look at this. Seller packaged DVD perfectly and sent it in a timely manner. Would not hesitate to purchase from seller again.,1453680000,6,196,4.472222222222222
8606151,3,B00EJUXNAG,"I've tried hard to like this set.  However, after viewing five of the films, I'm disheartened that the transfers to DVD lack any enhancement...the films were simply transferred with all the warts of the ravages of time included.  The soundtrack is muddled for the most part.  That, combined with the various British accents makes about half of the dialogue indecipherable, so I lose much of the story.  I hope I see improvement in the remaining 10 films, but don't expect to see anything better than what I've seen so far.",1424390400,13,522,4.766666666666667
8606152,4,B00EJUXNAG,"If your not a hitch fan , you may not like some of these titles. the film quality is not great on a few. But for this many movies at this low price. I am happy with this set.",1417478400,7,174,3.4871794871794872
