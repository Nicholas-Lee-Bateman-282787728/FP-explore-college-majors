If it weren't for Lugosi's purposely camp acting and Tor Johnson as the loathsome Lobo, this film wouldn't be worth watching at all, even with its terrible  rubber octopus. Except for a few daylight outside scenes, most of it's shot  on stage.  The trees, the rain, the lightning, the evil dwelling, the  subterranean chamber of horrors (a combination of Dr. Frankenstein and Las  Vegas), the atomic ray (mini portable mike boom with attached photo  enlarger), the operating table (padded doctor's examination table with  restraining straps), are all fakes and ad hoc incongruities.  The Monster  Octopus is so bad, everyone that lands on it has to scream and roll around  and grab at its tentacles to make it look alive.  And it's no use trying to  excuse the acting; everyone except Lugosi and Johnson seem destined to  break into TV commercials.  The directing is the usual Wood style: no  attempt whatsoever to edit anything.  And the storyline: universally  reviled and misunderstood super medical genius (Lugosi, aka Varnoff)  retreats to seclusion with his atavistic assistant (Johnson, aka Lobo) to  perfect his master work: supermen from men (except that, oops, all the  experiments die).  Notable scenes: Varnoff and Lobo chuckle  maliciously (Lobo is mute, so he can only grin) as they watch their latest  victim struggle with the monster rubber octopus on the other side of the  door; Lobo gets the hots for King, and Lugosi
beats him down with a limp  whip (Lobo also has a hat fetish); Lugosi hypnotizes King to sleep two or  three times (get a load of the hand action); Lobo and Lugosi-look-alike  battle in the subterranean chamber for the luscious body of Loretta King.  Notable quotes: ""You will soon be as big as a giant...with the strength  of twenty men...or, like all the others...dead.""  What a genius!  These are just a few of the immortal gems awaiting you in this terrible  sci-fi horror classic.  I can't really recommend this movie to anyone  except a hard-core terrible movie buff such as myself, because movies of  this sort are an acquired taste (one must wade through the truly bad stuff  to get to the ""good"" stuff).

The story begins with the worst storm in years. Two men seek shelter in an old deserted house. They are turned away, and see the monster. A man is attacked by the tentacles of an octopus. [On land?] The other is captured by the Monster. Vornoff has a test subject now. [Isn't this more funny than scary?] Oops! Another mistake. A man is arrested for vagrancy (for 72 hours). The Captain gets his newspapers (humor). People disappear in the swamp. ""There is no such thing as monsters in the 20th century."" A newspaper reporter wants to learn more. Who bought the old Willows place? Professor Strowsky tells about the Loch Ness monster. He will investigate for himself. [Great dialogue?] Lobo captures Janet. What is causing the changes in the weather?

They find Janet Lawton's car! A foreign government wants Vornoff to return to his country. He was expelled for wanting to experiment on humans with atomic chemicals. There is drama in the conversation. [The rubber octopus is funny, not scary.] Ha-ha-ha. [No flashlight for the dark?] How many bullets in that revolver? Janet is in the laboratory. The policeman discovers her. But Lobo acts. Suddenly Lobo goes loco! Will he save Janet? Will Janet free Lt. Craig? Will Vornoff get a taste of his own medicine? [Is this believable?] Vornoff is turned into a super-creature. [Really his double.] The fight causes a fire. The police arrive, then shoot at Vornoff without any effect.

1017195,2,6305400989,"Bride of the Monster, aka Bride of the Atom

An Ed Wood film.  Need I say more?

Bela Lugosi's last speaking part in this 1956 campy silliness as a mad doctor who somehow makes a fierce octopus that grabs people that walk too near Lake Marsh.  The two guys who first get it are commenting on how unnatural the lightning is, and this is most likely caused by atomic bombs.  Of course we don't listen to that, those are just a couple of superstitious hunters, right?

Well, after an attempt to get out of the rain but they are rebuffed by Lugosi's character (Dr. Varnoff) and his mute friend Lobo (who actually screams when you whip him, go figure).  One guy falls in the swamp and gets attacked by the aforementioned octopus (why he just doesn't stand up, I don't know) and the other guy is put on a table and experimented on.

He dies.

Somehow a female reporter (Loretta King) gets the headlines that a monster is on the loose.  This is not confirmed by the police nor anyone else.  How she got that headline in the paper is anyone's guess.  Her fianc is on the police force, too and they have a chat with the police chief, bantering about.  The chief (Henry Dunn, also seen on Teenagers from Outer Space, my review is buried on that farce elsewhere) has a pet bird that sits on his shoulder. Joy.

Anyway, long story short, Lugosi gets the girl on the table.  Lobo likes her too much to see her fry and saves her.  He then performed the experiment on Varnoff.  Unfortunately the machine works on Varnoff, killing everyone else.  Strange.

How can Lobo and Varnoff be bullet proof, yet the bullets don't mark their clothing?  Why do guns have 7 or 8 bullets in them?  Why are the alligators near the swamp also bullet proof?  Oh, and there is a small spy problem with a doctor who wants to take Varnoff back home to some communist country to help them make supermen.  That does not work out too well either.

Campy dialogue, overacting and an awful bantering episode between the chief and a file room woman -- awrghh....

Good movie to see for a laugh.  I was surprised that the machine actually worked and did not kill Varnoff.  Lugosi's double was about a foot taller and wider than the slight Hungarian actor.

Two stars for effort.  Did you know that hypnosis can work through solid wood doors if you curl your fingers just right?

1017196,3,6305400989,"Prime nonsense from the imagination of Ed Wood, featuring his regular ""stock company"" (Paul Marco, Tor Johnson, Dolores Fuller).  BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is arguably his most polished and coherent effort, though it's of course also loaded with the stiff dialogue, clunky special effects and clumsy continuity errors we all love from this masterly moviemaker whose heart and best intentions were always in the right place.

Bela Lugosi is zany Dr. Vornoff, who lives in a ramshackle mansion in the middle of a swamp.  Armed with brutish lab assistant Lobo (Tor Johnson) and a giant plastic octopus, Vornoff conducts experiments on trespassers, by trying to harness atomic energy in a quest to create a race of super-humans.  Snoopy reporter Janet Lawton (Loretta King) looks set to be his next victim when she decides to investigate the latest series of swamp disappearances...

The ""highlight"" of BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is the mechanical rubber octopus, which Wood ""borrowed"" from the props department of Republic Studios.  It was made for the John Wayne picture WAKE OF THE RED WITCH (1948).  Unfortunately, Wood forgot to borrow the mechanical motor that caused the tentacles to thrash about, so the victims of the octopus had to physically sit on top of the creature and make the tentacles move themselves!

Loretta King allegedly nabbed the role of Janet because she had just come into a small inheritance and would also bankroll the film.  The story is maintained by Dolores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend and GLEN OR GLENDA? leading lady; who was originally slated to play Janet but instead relegated to only one scene and a few lines of dialogue in a small role as one of Janet's friends.  However, in interviews, Ms King later denied those allegations, stating that money never exchanged hands and she was in fact offered the role by an agent.  Whatever the reason, I'm glad Loretta King won the role over Ms Fuller.  As an actress, Ms Fuller was a fantastic songwriter.

BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is perfect entertainment for late-night movie buffs.",1245888000,2,2043,4.991150442477876
1017197,5,6305400989,"In my estimation, part of the general concern about the shift from physical media to digital is the well-founded fear that some of cinema's greatest ""treasures"" will not be given the time, effort and expense necessary to convert them.  What I'm suggesting is that things like B-movies, which we enjoy because they're so terrible, might get short-shrift.

Fortunately it appears that Amazon is willing to support our beloved ""classics,"" as evidenced by the inclusion of Bride of the Monster in their digital catalog.

This, of course, is one of Ed Wood's legendary stinkers, featuring the dynamic duo from the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space, the oversized Swede Johnson and a fortunately still-living-at-the-time Lugosi.  As far as B-movies go, anything with Johnson's lumbering frame in it is an instant classic, and special touches like Lugosi's tangle with a rubber octopus are just icing on the cake.

As you may be able to tell from the preview video, this version of Bride of the Monster has been digitally re-touched and colorized, ensuring that the quality of presentation is suitable to viewing on a high-resolution computer monitor.",1228435200,2,1143,5.1567567567567565

Wood's direction is vibrant and healthy - enthusiastic performances were pulled out of every actor large or small. No aspect is strained or repeated unnecessarily.

Despite his wasted look and frail physique--quite a contrast to his powerful, handsome presence in such '30's classics as The Black Cat and The Invisible Ray--Bela still did an admirable job: he was truly one of a kind; no one could do the mad scientist any better.

You've got the mad scientist who is still practicing his forbidden experiments in a creepy old mansion.  Plus he's still being pursued and persecuted from people in his own country who originally mocked his genius.

His laboratory is accessible through a secret entrance behind the fireplace.

He's got a nice monster in the swamp for getting rid of people.

But it's the execution of the movie that some people (not me) may find disappointing.

Maybe it will be the refridgerator and stove down in the lab.  I guess Bella could have made himself a nice snack in between radiating peoples' brains.

Maybe it will be the monster in the tank that just doesn't seem to be that interested in eating people.

Anyway the aging Bella gives the performance of his life.  He even falls back on some of his Dracula skills to hypnotize the lovely heroine (the 'bride').

Actually as some other reviewers mentioned I'm not exactly sure what she was supposed to be the bride of.  Someone suggested Bella was going to hook her up with Lobo.

1017334,1,6305400989,"Believe me, a one star rating is generous!  I've seen some bad B horror and science fiction movies in my time and this one has to rank among the worst.  It comes close to Plan Nine from Outer Space, as the worst movie ever released.  Poor Bela Lugosi!  This movie proves the fact that a drug addict will do anything to get a fix.  These type of movies do have a hypnotic effect in that you keep watching because you can't believe how bad it is until at last the horror is over.",1139443200,,477,4.086021505376344
1017335,4,6305400989,"Ed Wood was a lousy filmaker and director. His movies are notoriously bad. That's what makes them watchable. This film is arguably one of his better attempts. That is truly frightening. That's OK because the only frightening thing about this ""monster movie"" is that it was supposed to be taken seriously. That in itself is amusing.

The story is of a series of mysterious dissapearances in the swamp near town. The police and a snoopy woman reporter are all there to investigate. As it turns out, the reason for the mysterious vanishings is a mad scientist fugitive from Easter Europe who is trying to use atomic energy to creat a race of atomic supermen to conquer the world. Hilarious.

Bela Lougosi plays the mad scientist. Watching him is amusing on its own. His conception of ""mad scientist"" seems to comprise his accent, gratuitous pseudo-scientific words and some strange throwbacks to his earlier career as Dracula. His is one of the better acting jobs.

Tor Johnson, a former pro wrestler, plays the evil sidekick and monster. His dialog consists of ""ARRRRGH!"" He too is fun to watch.

Perhaps the best single job of acting in this film is by the giant octopus. It is made of rubber and says nothing.

It may seem like I am blasting this film. I am when it comes to serious cinema. It is, however, so poorly done as to be worth buying and watching. This is especially true of Ed Wood fans.",1116633600,3,1398,4.6437246963562755
1017336,4,6305400989,"""Bride of the Monster,"" also known as ""Bride of the Atom,"" is the 1956 Ed Wood film where Bela Lugosi wrestles with a giant fake octopus (oh, THAT Ed Wood film). The argument here is not that this is a good movie, but we are talking Ed Wood, which means a whole different criteria for evaluating a film and your enjoyment in viewing same. Yes, this is a bad film, but there is such an earnestness to Wood's efforts that he is obviously oblivious to it all, which makes the film equally endearing and depressing. The man got his movies made, so I just do not see this as sad as those people who finally get the opportunity to make a film and make some dreadful splatter flick. So, now, Ed Wood is not in the lowest circle of the cinematic inferno. This is NOT a four-star film, my friends, just a four-star cinematic experience. Big difference.

Lugosi is the evil mad scientist Dr. Eric Vornoff, who uses his dumb assistant, Lobo (Tor Johnson) to capture the locals so he can use atomic energy to transform them into supermen back as his laboratory in an abandoned house in the middle of a swamp where the pet rubber octopus out back is used to dispose of the mistakes. Intrepid girl reporter Janet Lawton (Loretta King) investigates the disappearances, although her fiance, Detective Lt. Dick Craig (Tony McCoy) tries to warn her off. Janet is captured by Lobo and (horrors) forced to wear a wedding dress (thereby justifying if not explaining the title). Can Dick and the other cops rescue her in time?

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" remains the apex of bad Ed Wood films, but all things considered ""Bride of the Monster"" has to come in second. The acting is probably worse, but so is the script, so I just do not find as many memorably lines that force you to howl in laughter. Much is made of Lugosi's participation in these Ed Wood flicks and this is the one where the old actor has the most to do as he goes tampering with God's domain. He gives it his all despite the problems with the script and the fact there is no budget for making this movie.

""Night of the Ghouls"" is considered a sequel to this film because Tor Johnson again plays ""Lobo,"" but do not expect any more continuity between the two than that if you bother to track it down, but then there is not reason for you to do so. After ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" this is the Ed Wood film to check out, and if you really want to find out more about Ed then ""Glen or Glenda."" But beyond those three, and obviously the ""Ed Wood"" bio-pic from Tim Burton starring Johnny Depp, you are on your own",1099958400,,2553,4.359243697478991

I know he's acheived a cult status at this point, but Ed Wood was an intense man with an extreme passion for this medium, and this film should be watched by everyone.  Lugosi is so amazing, he tries so hard.  Watch Ed Wood by Burton and Depp, and then watch this movie.  It'll break your heart.",1098403200,2,405,4.141025641025641
1017338,4,6305400989,"Basically this a sci-fi flick with an interesting story. The actors were not as atrocious as in Glen or Glenda. Sure they were wooden, but they weren't as cardboard cut out as Dolores was in that or many of the actors that were in that. In some ways though sympathies have to go to Bela Lugosi. He tries his damnedest to do his best in every film and is only let down by nearly all of those around him. His assistant Lobo ( or Tor ) isn't so bad himself. He plays the silent part well and knows how to carry out his job perfectly. It's just a pity he had to be in this film. Everybody else just is a bit too hammy in their acting to be really believable and well when it comes to inanimate objects that are pretending to be snakes or giant octopusses, the less said the better! Well actually, I might as well divulge them anyway......basically see them scream and squirm and toss and turn when the thing does absolutely nothing is hilarious.
Another problem is the ending which happens a little too quick. I know some might just turn off the DVD when they think it's all just crap but it seems Ed spent ages on how to plot the suspense and leaves you short changed on the ending. Just a simple few words "" He messed with..."" blah blah blah and kaboosh show's over folks. It's not so much of a happy ending as more of a botched job of an ending.

1017472,2,6305400989,"Ed Wood films cannot be described without resorting to pejoratives.  ""So bad, it's funny"" doesn't capture the essence of this movie.  That speaks volumes, considering the many examples of schlock cinema that is out there in cheesy movie land.  Bela Lugosi, regardless of the serious merits of his actor's work record, has the dubious distinction of starring in some of the lowest of the low budget turkeys of all time.  As Varnoff, the crazed scientist, he seeks to create a master race of atomic giants.  Bela's lab/dungeon displays a flat wall that is painted to suggest rock.  Note the prominent sink, cabinets, and refrigerator that look as if they emerged from a Good Housekeeping ad of 1955.  Surpassing the absurdities of the set are the platform shoes (suggesting atomic height) worn by Bela's double during the climactic battle with Lobo (Tor Johnson).  The inanimate rubber octopus is the stuff of low budget legend.  The metal cap with wires attached worn by the victim strapped to the table compliment the ersatz Frankenstein aura of the electrodes and the other hardware.  The angora effect is evident.  The moderately priced DVD edition has a sharp image, but dark tones abound.  The audio is inferior.  Considering the silly dialogue, that isn't all bad news.  Collectors of vintage cheesy horror flicks need this movie in their library regardless of the challenges.  Bela Lugosi fans still ponder his professional decline.  From the original Universal Studios Dracula to Ed Wood was a downward spiral of just over 20 years.  Proceed at your peril.  ;-)",1085011200,3,1568,5.035019455252918

A MUST for your collection if you loved the movie ""Ed Wood"", because this is the actual film where some scenes in ""Wood"" were re-created. The best part of this film is the speech made by Bela Lugosi about ""having no home""... though poorly written, Lugosi delivers the lines with such conviction and emotion, HOW he says it is far more important than what he is actually saying .... he was wonderful in this film.
The transfer on this DVD is clear and sharp and sound is superb. I love this odd movie but I know I will enjoy it again and again. I recommend this one highly for the camp and unintentional comedy it contains, but also for being one of the purest examples of truly bad 50s horror.",1084665600,2,942,4.357954545454546
1017474,5,6305400989,"'Bride of the Monster' is probably Ed Wood's genuinely best movie, though it is, of course, still a low budget piece of cinematic cheese. I love Wood, and think his films are delightful in their ingenuity, stream-of-consciousness dialogue, illogical editing, and weirdo cast members and hangers on (I particularly miss Criswell and Vampira in this one.) In 'Bride of the Monster' (originally 'Bride of the Atom') Wood weaves a tale of mayhem, aging lunatic scientists (Bela Lugosi as Dr. Eric Vornoff) and their mute giant henchmen (Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson as 'Lobo'), pretty news reporters (Dolores Fuller), and giant rubber octopi. The story is fairly irrelevant, as in most Wood films, although some see this as Ed's anti-nuclear picture, which though reasonable, is not my personal opinion. I think the nuclear backdrop in the film is a device to explain the presence of Lugosi and his plot to make 'atomic powered supermen' to take over the world, but I could be wrong and you are free to have your own interpretation.
The standout bits of unintentional comedy in this movie (present in all Wood films, though here less than most) are the colander on the head device in Vornoff's laboratory, the incredibly silly looking rubber octopus that cast members had to deal with (this is a story in itself as Ed appropriated the octopus from a major studio, but forgot to bring the device that made it work, so cast members ended up pulling the legs around them in their 'death struggle' scenes), and the now famous atomic explosion (requested by a financial backer of the film) at the end, which has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. Pure Ed Wood genius, in other words.
The movie is the last one ever by Bela Lugosi (the minute or so of Lugosi in 'Plan 9' was used after Bela's death), and some of his performance is excellent, particularly the beginning of the genuinely autobiographical ""I have no home"" speech. He also exhibits the creepy double-jointed finger movements he was famous for in 'Dracula' and they are still very creepy. The other acting, while not Oscar worthy, is also a step above the typical Wood film.
In summary, I think 'Bride of the Monster' is worth five stars for several reasons: first, it is probably Wood's genuinely best film; two, it is fun to watch in the spirit of campy old monster movies; and three, Bela Lugosi shines in his last role. Sure it's wacky, disjointed, and at times nonsensical, but if you get into the spirit of it, it's a fun film to watch by yourself, of better yet, with likeminded friends.",1080864000,27,2564,4.764044943820225

Also, Tor Johnson plays ""LOBO"" Dr. Vornoff's hulking zombie assistant with far more animation than his PLAN 9 role as a hulking zombie police detective. My only complaint is that Vampira was not in BOTM to round out the terrible trio! Plot? Dr. Vornoff (sounds like cheap vodka doesn't it?) is attempting to take over the world by creating an army of radiated supermen (unfortunately, he keeps killing his victims instead). He and Lobo live in a big, spooky abandoned house with their pet octopus (??!). A female reporter gets nosey after a pair of locals disappear. She goes to the ""vacant"" old house to snoop around. She is captured by Lobo and taken to Vornoff's lab. Somehow, she ends up in a wedding dress and is set to be zapped by Vornoff's evil contraption, when suddenly, Lobo goes berserk, untying the girl and attacking Vornoff! This leads to Dr. V being zonked by his own machine, turning him into a giant (check out the Bela-double in the 7"" platform KISS shoes). This all ends in a duel between Bela and the lifeless rubber octopus. Now, from what I've just described, how can you possibly lose??

Amusing,but not as good/bad as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The movie is still worth a look if only for the ""seriousness"" with which Wood made it.

1017611,3,6305400989,"Bela Lugosi, Jr. once said in an interview that his father always gave his best to a performance, no matter how bad the movie itself was. This is true in the case of ""Bride of the Monster."" Lugosi's performance is the highlight of the film; despite his obviously frail health, he does a good job as Dr. Eric Vornoff, employing Dracula-like hand motions, extreme close-ups of his glaring eyes, and evil little chuckles.
As for the rest of the film...well, it's not as bad as I would have expcted an Ed Wood film to be. Sure, the octopus is so fake it's ridiculous, and the dreaded atomic machine is a doctor's examining table with a salad bowl for your head, but it's not a total shambles of a production to the extent than ""Plan 9"" would be.
The movie probably looks better than it did originally, due to a very good transfer to DVD; the picture is great for an old movie which was at the time cheaply made. The sound, however, could have been a little better; I had turn my TV volume almost all the way up in order to hear Loretta King speak and make out what Lugosi was saying, with his thick accent.
If you're a fan of the movie ""Ed Wood,"" it's worth checking out to see the real ""Bride"" portrayed in that film. I would also recommend it to loyal Lugosi fans who want to see Bela in his final speaking role. He said he wanted to work until the end, and although ""Bride"" is by no stretch a worthy farewell to such a fine actor, you will still enjoy Lugosi's performance.",1043366400,9,1472,4.298561151079137

The victims are fitted with a funny hat, have a piece of photograph processing equipment aimed at them, and are fed to the giant rubber octopus out back.
Spunky gal reporter Janet (Loretta King) decides to investigate the locals' disappearances much to the collective chagrin of her straight arrow fiance, detective Dick (Tony McCoy) and Captain Robbins (Harvey B. Dunn). Janet is captured by Lobo and held prisoner. Dick and his partner follow convenient victim Professor Strowski (George Becwar) to the swamp. For some unknown reason, perhaps to explain the title, Janet is eventually dressed in a wedding gown. Soon, Dick and Janet do battle with Vornoff and Lobo as Robbins and half a half dozen cops close in.
Written and directed by Ed Wood, this film is awful but not as technically inept as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" Wood does let his cast aspire to whole new depths of lousy acting. The entire cast is stiff, and the audience's sympathy falls squarely on Lugosi. His performance is not just bad, it is sad.
As mentioned, the ""bride"" in the title is King, but who is she supposed to be marrying? Vornoff? Lobo? The rubber octopus? There is a throw away line about her being the bride of an atom, which makes no sense.
Ed Wood is looked upon with fondness today; some might say he simply made films that are child-like and innocent. I have seen some of his films, and they are instead both childish and insolent. Good intentions do not a good film make, and the only thing good here are its intentions. I do not recommend it.

If you look past the cheesy octopus (no worse than the hysterical devil bat), the cheap sets and the lame acting (better than Scared to Death!), if you suspend a little disbelief and realize this movie was made for a song -- then actually it is pretty darned good. One reason for this is that Bela Lugosi gets ample screen time and if Ed Wood was a bit unimaginative he at least knew what it was that made Lugosi a legend and reprises little details from the mad scientific leering of the Devil Bat to the idiosyncratic hand gestures of White Zombie.
Bela is given a chance to shine in his final speaking performance and shine he does. The movie has its flaws, but Bela is not one of them. He is old and looks weak, but he carries the movie like a true champion. He makes empty dialog sound meaningful and implausible scenarios seem poignant (well almost poignant).
Bela's ""I have no home"" monolog is beautiful. He could make dialog such as ""I have proven that I am alright!"" sound good. Lugosi gives his all in his last performance, and it is a great performance, even if he does have to wrestle with a fake octopus.",1015027200,2,1362,4.303501945525292

I had to jump in and review this DVD because I was very leery of buying it based on a fairly negative review last year in Scarlet Street magazine. Their complaints: 1) badly-framed trailer; 2) too much headroom in many shots; 3) many scenes too dark; 4) much darker than previous VHS issue; 5) end title shot is minus atom bomb explosion/Hollywood U.S.A. titles. My responses: 1) the trailer is badly-framed, but it is also sharper, cleaner, and with better tonal values than I have ever seen it; 2) I don't think you can fault Image for including as much of the actual frame as possible-framing issues (at least in this case) implicate the filmmakers, not the DVD transfer; 3) & 4) I have the previous VHS issue, and if it's the one referred to in Scarlet Street (which I think it is) it's way too bright, and the DVD is really more accurate, I think, in rendering the tonal values. The daytime shots and interiors all look perfectly fine to me. There are some night shots that are a bit dense, but you can tell they were just underlit because when lightning flashes everything looks perfectly exposed. There probably is more detail in those shots on the VHS since the brightness is jacked up; the rest of the movie looks washed-out and flat on the tape; 5) the plain white-on-black end titles do not seem to have been tacked on by Wade Williams, appearing instead to be from some theatrical issue of the movie (since they optically dissolve into the final credit roll). Personally, I can live without the original end title shot seeing as how the rest of the movie looks 500% better than the tape, and you still get a few good mushroom cloud shots before ""The End."" Otherwise SS agreed that the print/transfer is very sharp (in some shots you can see the individual hairs on people's necks). There is some minor flecking throughout but I didn't notice any major scratchy areas or jumps. In sum, don't be afraid to purchase, I was very pleasantly surprised and can honestly say I've never seen a better copy on TV or tape. Minus one star only because there are no extras other than the (badly-framed) trailer and chapter stops, and the light flecking on the print. P.S. On second viewing, I think some of the complaints about darkness/lighting in this movie are due to the fact that in a number of scenes the actors, particularly Bela and Tor, refuse to ""stay in their light."" If you observe closely you can see how the DP's low-key lighting scheme is destroyed by Wood's allowing Bela and Tor to wander about the set from ""pool of light"" to ""pool of light,"" often exchanging dialogue in the midst of near-darkness. The static shots of talking people, etc., do not suffer from this problem. See for yourself.",998524800,6,2788,4.589178356713427
1017616,5,6305400989,"Thus utters a frail-looking Bela Lugosi in this laughably awful EC comic-like film directed by the notorious Ed Wood. Bela was in terrible physical health when this film was made - his 20-year morphine/methadone addiction had taken its toll on the 72-year old actor. Shortly after this film was completed, the great man entered himself into the hospital to kick his heinous habit. ...And he did! However, I have mixed feelings when I watch Lugosi in this film. I laugh (WITH him, not at him) in his grand, over-the-top performance, but I also want to cry when I see how ravaged he looks, and how shameful his addiction must have been for him. Aside, ""Bride"" is a lot of fun, if a little slow in spots. From the incredibly cheap laboratory set (did Bela make 8 x 10s of his victims? There is a photographic enlarger on a microphone stand, positioned over the ""operating table""!), to the visibly inert rubber octopus (Wood and his cronies failed to steal the octopus' motor when they ""borrowed"" it from Republic's prop department), to the hokey 40s B-movie dialogue, this film is manna to the trashy film lover. The DVD's picture quality is razor-sharp, so you can enjoy every nuance of Bela's performance, as well as the aforementioned laboratory set, to lovely little details, such as the leopard-print throw in Loretta King's car, Tony McCoy's tattoos, and the fact that it is NOT Lugosi grappling with Tor ""Lobo"" Johnson, nor is he wrestling the lethargic octopus. It is stuntman Eddie Parker, wearing a hellified pair of platform shoes! I love Ed Wood's films - they are hard NOT to love, in their naive goofiness.

But if you're not already an Ed Head, this is not the movie to make you one. I'd recommend instead Ed's debut ""Glen or Glenda"" or his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". ""Bride"" is draggy even by Wooden standards. And there's only one moment of classic Ed Wood dialogue: The police captain tells the female investigative reporter, ""Nobody believes in monsters anymore. This is the 20th century."" and she replies, ""Don't count on it."" She then realizes the jaw-dropping stupidity of what's just been said[i.e., that we can't count on what century it is] and adds in an obvious ad-lib, ""Uh, don't count on there being no such things as monsters, I mean!"" Also... fans will appreciate that the very same reporter will later get nicely tied up by the fiendish Lugosi, and what a fetching Damsel-in-Distress she makes, too, with her sobbing and her bosom heaving as she squirms helplessly against her bonds and...uh, that is, if you're the kind of [person]  who's into that sort of thing. That stuff doesn't interest ME in the least, as you can plainly see. Don't count on it.",978739200,3,1214,4.753554502369668
1017618,3,6305400989,"Ed Wood said this film would be a whole lot better than ""Glen or Glenda"". What he said was only partly true. ""Bride of the Monster"" (originally called ""Bride of the Atom"") is still a terrible movie.
Once again, Bela Lugosi stars as a mad scientist, bent on revenge. Aided by his assistant Lobo, he performs experiments on captured victims. Loretta King (playing a role originally intended for Wood's fiance) becomes the latest victim of the mad scientist's fiendish schemes.
""Bride of the Monster"" looks as if every scene was filmed in one take. Although in Tim Burton's biopic ""Ed Wood"", the making of ""Bride of the Monster"" shows Lobo walking into a door frame. That wasn't shown in the finished product, so Wood must have had some vestige of professionalism.
Like ""Glen or Glenda"" the film is padded out with stock footage of wild jungle, an atomic explosion and a writhing octopus (which  fools people into thinking that the rubber octopus the actors tangle with is a terrifying predator).
I once heard that in addition to using stock footage, Wood also took a home movie camera into cinemas so he could steal the soundtracks from other people's movies. I suppose that's what you call appropriation.
Although there is killing and violence in ""Bride of the Monster"" the film has a naive innocence about it. There are films a lot worse than this.",975715200,3,1348,4.785407725321888
1017619,3,6305400989,One of Ed Woods more famous films. Not as bad as the reputation says. If you like the old Monogram films with Bela Lugosi you'll like this one too. Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist trying to create superhumans in his cottage in the swamps. Tor Johnson is perfectly cast as Bela's angora loving servant Lobo. A must for lovers of old horror movies.,970704000,,348,4.453125
1017620,2,6305400989,"Released in 1956, ""Bride of the Monster"" is an enjoyable schlock-fest from Grade-Z auteur Edward D. Wood, Jr. However, the film rises above its ultra-low budget thanks to the presence of Bela Lugosi. Regardless of personal and professional misfortunes, Bela plays Dr. Eric Vornoff as though it were the performance of his life. Sadly, it would be Lugosi's last starring and speaking role. Despite the amateurish supporting cast and obvious production flaws (who can forget that rubber octopus), ""Bride of the Monster"" has a comic-book charm that's hard to resist  definitely superior to Wood's ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953) and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (1959). Hollywood has managed to surpass Ed Wood's cinematic ineptitude on a larger scale with ""Showgirls"" and ""Battlefield Earth."" For once, let's give the Master of Bad Cinema his due.",970444800,18,834,5.223880597014926

I was surprised at the parallel alienation of the mad doctor and Lobo but their responses were opposite. For me, it adds a (somewhat sad) humanistic quality.

were acting and still better than 99% of the no talent hacks in hollyweird today! This movie is by far not even close to the worst movie
ever made! Yes it's not up to Universal classic horror but neither was the budget Wood had either! If you over look some bad acting by
a the girl and the guy in the main roles the rest of the cast are good and funny like most of these type of movies. The story is written well
and not bad job directing either. It's one of my favorite movies and not as bad as most reviewers comment! A must have for Bela fans.",1428883200,,692,3.985611510791367

Wrestler Toj Johnson, veteran of 31 films, provided his expertise being able to play a mute (unless whipped) a role he would encore. This was the era when cars looked like tanks and bras were fashioned after bullets. I'm not sure the title was truly fitting. And what was that major league mushroom cloud at the end?

An enjoyable sci-fi horror film from the legendary Ed Wood is one of those so bad it's good kind of films with a charm to it. Sure some of the special effects are low budget like the octopus for example and the story is a bit out of place yet the lighting and camera work is very good. It's sad to see this is Bela's last role before his death and he was a fantastic actor no doubt, i first saw this movie on TV when i was 9 back in 91 on TNT and i also enjoyed the MST3K version when i was 11 when the episode first aired. This movie is a bit slow in places but still enjoyable no doubt.

The DVD has good picture quality for being an Image release and has trailer with it.",1370649600,,1094,4.083720930232558

It may be putrid but it sure ain't boring. If yer lookin' for well-crafted cinema keep movin' right along, folks - but if you love ""so bad it's good"" (and ya probably wouldn't be reading this if ya didn't) then by all means pitch yer tent and stay awhile!",1341014400,,547,4.425742574257426
