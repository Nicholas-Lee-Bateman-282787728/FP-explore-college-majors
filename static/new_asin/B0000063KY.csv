7903897,3,B0000063KY,"One of the two videos in this package, ""Pro Sports Bloopers,"" is a mildly amusing 30-minute video includes some decent ""blooper"" footage from such unremembered pro sports leagues as the USFL, USBL, and CBA. It also has some B&W newsreel footage of what was considered unusual sports from the 1930's, like women's soccer and tackle football, as well as dog soccer and a ping-pong specialist playing a game against himself. The boxer's mom jumping into the ring and swinging her shoe to stop a fight is somewhat interesting. There is some spectacular footage of a four-man acrobatic slam-dunk team from the 1970's and some college footage of Manute Bol. The only major league, major sport footage is from when the Philadelphia Phillies' bus broke down in 1986 in Florida. Seeing one player sticking his thumb and hat out of the bus window is very amusing and really gets accross the point of how bored they were waiting for their bus to be fixed or something.

As this video is only 30 minutes long, you won't get that bored, but it makes for better ""ambient"" video at a bar or party than it would a serious choice for sitting down and watching.",1118188800,,1143,4.686567164179104
