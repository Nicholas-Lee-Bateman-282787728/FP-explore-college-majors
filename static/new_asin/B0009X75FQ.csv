From start to finish, EXCELLENT. If you do not have a sense of humor, do not buy this movie. This was definitely a good investment.",1139270400,4,297,3.966666666666667
2332206,1,B0009X75FQ,This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time buying it. They have reject actors playing the parts of Dame Dash and Jay-Z (who do terrible jobs)!! Movie had no point to it.. Simply terrible.,1138492800,5,213,4.35

8069018,1,B0009X75FQ,"I love hip hop, but this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The story line was trash and even worse, the acting. Save your money for a real movie.",1390003200,,167,3.9411764705882355

8069023,3,B0009X75FQ,"This was an ok way to spend your time when you have nothing else to do.  The people who portray members of ""The Rock"" really don't look much like the actual individuals, but maybe thats part of the comedic equation.  All in all it has its laugh out loud moments, so I would say its worth it to check it out.",1200614400,,307,4.016393442622951
8069024,1,B0009X75FQ,"This movie sucks. Talentless gibberish and stereotypical garbage. I really don't see how anyone rational could say this movie is of any value. Its boring, its stupid, it wasn't funny at all. I'll probably get a drinking problem now trying to forget that I ever had to watch this trash.

Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even think about this movie. Its bad! I would give it a -5 if I could. This should be put in the same place as Arsenio Hall, FORGOTTEN!",1175990400,8,457,4.376470588235295
