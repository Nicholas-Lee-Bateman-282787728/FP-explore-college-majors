8006792,3,B00015HXBS,"Sword of Venus (1953) Starring Robert Clarke, Catherine McLeod, Dan O'Herlihy, William Shallert, Marjorie Stapp, Merritt Stone, Renee DeMarco, Eric Colmar, and Stuart Randall.  Directed by Harold Daniels.  Written and produced by Aubrey Wisberg and Jack Pollexfen

This black & white film stars Robert Clarke as Dantes, the only son of the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo.  Three people are out to get Dantes for both revenge and for his inheritance. To do this they plan a trap for him while he is on a trip from Paris to Monte Cristo.  The trap involves a woman (Catherine McLeod) who seeks Dantes help claiming that she is running away from an unloving husband.  Later, the alleged husband catches Dantes and the woman at an inn and threatens Dantes with a sword.  In self defense, Dantes shoots the man who feigns death (blanks in the gun).  He escapes but is soon caught and put in prison.  The lawyer of the three (played by William Shallert, known to some as Patty Duke's father in the 60s TV show), convinces Dantes that if he marries the woman he will get a pardon, though the real reason is so that she will inherit the Monte Cristo fortune after Dantes is condemned to death. Although Dantes is set for the guillotine, political circumstances in Paris commute the sentence to life at hard labor.  This twist causes the three to come up with another plan to kill him.  That doesn't work either and Dantes escapes from his captivity.  Another complication arises in that Dante's father dies and leaves the fortune to the nearest male heir leaving ""the wife"" out of it.  Now a whole new plan is hatched.  In the meantime, the woman, now Dantes wife, decides she will no longer have any part of the scheme and has, in fact, fallen in love with him - probably because he is so hopelessly nave as to believe anything the bad guys tell him. The final scheme is complicated to the point of confusing.

Overall the film has to its credit the fact that you never know what will happen next.  With all of the bungled plans it could have been a comedy.  Hey, maybe it was and I took it too seriously.  In any case, though, I think it's worth watching.  The quality of the film is not great but viewable and the sound is fine.  All the actors are talented and Clarke fits the role of leading man quite well.  McLeod's change from scoundrel to lover seems sudden and in need of more explanation, but, after all, it is a B movie, and one shouldn't expect too much.",1322697600,2,2458,4.515837104072398
