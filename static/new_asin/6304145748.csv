7862638,5,6304145748,Great combination of what medical care was like back then and the personal life of the female doctor.  Very enjoyable.,1391817600,,118,4.9
7862639,3,6304145748,"I enjoyed the medical setting, the era and the costumes but it did not hold my interest very long so I will not buy anymore of the series.",1380153600,,138,3.9642857142857144
7862640,1,6304145748,"Four stars for season one and two, three stars for season three and ABSOLUTELY ZERO stars for season 4. What on earth were they thinking in those two, final extended episodes?
Did the writer get brain damage? One of the best features of episode plots was the relationship between Eleanor and her father - and he's disappeared. Not even an attempt at explanation. Eleanor turns into a dimwitted, short sighted, emotional shrew and Dr. Marsham degenerates into Victorian depravity. Then, she loses her clinic, gets pregnant, ruins another man's career and aspirations, gets married and supposedly lives Victorianly happy ever after. How fulfilling - if you're a pre-60's teenager. What kind of ending is this?

Just view the first three seasons - watching the 4th will just make you want to puke. The 4th season was simply abysmal and makes you wish you hadn't started the whole series. I'm only guessing the BBC was taking advice from HBO. We put up with the gore-very moderate in comparison to the extremely boring, repetitive formula of gratuitous sex, violence, and obscenities of HBO-but did the new BBC/HBO union try to make this more marketable by putting in more about deviant? Child prostitution, selling young girls? Child abuse and pedophiles seem to be the hot selling themes in the big-sellers of advertising (all TV is interested in) in the USA, so that's all I can think the BBC is pandering too with season 4. Ugh! What a bunch of losers.

Here we were, immersed in an almost-authentic Victorian world and then Eleanor turns into a vapid, shallow, and downright silly character. I can't say Eleanor's character was ever well cast (those little, dreadful yellow teeth!), but she did a good job as a plain-Jane protagonist (even though other characters were supposed to find her beautiful - not believable). Take away the writer's awards; she's betrayed the whole profession of writing. Take away all BBC's government funding. British taxpayers should not have to fund the drivel of the final episodes.",1302739200,2,2014,4.991071428571429
7862641,5,6304145748,"When this series was first bradcast on our PBS TV staion WGBH Boston, I taped the series off air.  Then, I discovered I recorded the third episode twice & missed the second completely.  When I saw the set for sale in the WGBH catalog, I ordered it & finally, got to see the second episode!  This is a video set I watch over & over again.  I do this before I loan it to friends, just so I can keep the plots of the episodes ""straght"" in my mind.  When these series are broadcast, Russell Baker gives an opening & closing commentary on the episode.  These are missing from the commercial versions.  Without this commentary, the viewe may not know that the female lead Jemma Redgrave is related to Lyn Redgrave & Venessa Redgrave - They are Jemms's aunts.

I am a student of history, especially medical & nursing history.  This series gives me lots of insight into treatments that worked & didn't work in that era.  The actor Robert Hardy, who played Sigfried Farnan in ""All Creatures Great & Small"" plays a devious ""Sir Herbert"", one of the surgical professors at the East London Hospital.  He only appears in a small number of the episdes.  But, he is a prominent character in the first episode.  I got the impression Elanor Bramwell would have liked to kill Sir Herbert in that first episode, but when Lady Cora Petersgave Elanor the opportunity to serve the sick & poor in another setting, Elanor no longer had to deal with Sir Herbert.",1257638400,,1437,4.501930501930502
7862642,5,6304145748,"Spunk, determination, and trial are a part of this young woman's experience on becoming a doctor in London at the turn of the century.  A mix of intrigue, humor, and conscience spice each episode in a different way.  An entertaining study in the development of women's rights and social consciencness mixed with romance.  I highly recommend it.  Better than ER.",1002240000,10,361,4.966666666666667
7862643,5,6304145748,"I'm not a fan of medical dramas, so when I first read about Bramwell's appearance on Masterpiece Theatre, I wasn't honestly expecting to become so utterly addicted to this wonderfully acted, skillfully written glimpse into the 1890s medical profession.
Dr. Eleanor Bramwell is a female who treads into the typically masculine world of medicine in the mid 1890s.  Because she is a woman, she encounters immediate prejudice, is laughed at by colleagues, and, due to some of her moral objections, is soon banned from her position in a London hospital.  However, with the aid of wealthy female friend of the family, Eleanor finds herself in charge of a charitable thrift in the poverty-stricken East End.
As Eleanor, Jemma Redgraves gives a performance so believable that you quickly become attached to the persevering doctor.  Not only is her Eleanor talented, determined, and caring, but she is as flawed as any real human being-never a two-dimensional, stereotypical women's libber.  You applaud some of her decisions, while you might question others.  Bramwell episodes offer the viewer riveting drama, plot twists, and social commentary, as well as an engaging relationship between Eleanor and her physician father, who would prefer to have his daughter either married or caring for respectable ladies in a private practice.
I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in female social history, medicine, Victorian lives, or merely enthralling entertainment that's both intelligent and emotional.",994204800,10,1505,5.414529914529915
7862644,5,6304145748,"Meet Eleanor Branwell the only woman in her medical class. Daily she must endure the taunts and sexist remarks of her classmates and professor. Witnessing the out dated surgical practices of her professor sickens her and he refuses to even allow her to do surgery. Sounds like a woman in the the late 1960's or early 1970's trying to break into the medical field, right? WRONG!
  Our heroine is a woman from Victorian England just before the turn of the century. Fed up with the insults and abuse of patients Eleanor rebells against her professor who gladly bans her from the hospital. Fortunately she is given another chance by a Lady Cora Peters who enables her to set up a charity infirmary, The Thrift, in the East End slums.
  Jemma Redgrave plays this determined young woman who refuses to bow down to the conventions of her day. Jemma's remarkable performance gives depth and vitality to a character who is ahead of her time yet in many ways is still a woman of her times.
  Eleanor is not a saint. She is rigid in her moral and class attitudes which displays itself in the way she treats her servants and workers on the job. She is quick to judge and believes that she is always right. Such an attitude gets her into conflict with her father and Lady Peters. She shares the prejudices of her time but this is a woman of feeling who really cares about people. Throughout the series we see her grow into more understanding.
  Bramwell covers the ethical and moral issues of medicine that we face today in addition to other problems. It tells the story of people trying to make a difference in a world of greed, prestige, religious and racial bigotry, and poverty. You see the worst and best of people. You have great acting and great episodes in this video.",969926400,20,1763,4.556962025316456
7862645,4,6304145748,"I went to Law School in the early 1970s when only 15% of us were women.  Compared to Dr. Bramwell though, we had it easy.  We didn't think so but, after seeing this series, I conclude one had to have a hide like a super  rhino to survive as an MD back then. Everyone felt it was very apropos to  just pound away at a woman professional then. They especially loved  throwing the word ""spinster"" in her face about every ten minutes  or so. Bramwell survives, even thrives, based on a number of factors.  She  has a lot of grit and determination but she also has a father in private  practice and a widowed patroness looking for a worthy medical charity to  endow.  Enter Dr. Bramwell and The Thrift, a Free Clinic ahead of its time.
