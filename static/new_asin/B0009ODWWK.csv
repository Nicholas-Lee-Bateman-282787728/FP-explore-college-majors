8158214,4,B0009ODWWK,"Sherlock Holmes: Dressed to Kill &Terror by Night

These two movies were adapted from the Sherlock Holmes stories. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the four long stories and fifty-six short stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading; you will appreciate them more as an adult. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Dressed to Kill [1946] is about stolen music boxes. One has an engraved plate that can be used to print counterfeit 5 notes that cant be distinguished from genuine 5 notes! Can Sherlock Holmes recover the plates and catch the criminals?

Terror By Night [1946] is about an expensive diamond which brings bad luck to its owner. Sherlock Holmes will guard it. There is a murder in a railway carriage, one of the passengers must be the murderer!",1471305600,,1143,4.973821989528796
8158215,2,B0009ODWWK,"Do not buy Critic's Choice Sherlock Holmes DVD's as the one above.  I purchased this one and others and am sorry I did. They are poor quality, shakey blurry, and faded.  I purchased MPI Double Feature Sherlock Holmes and am very happy.  MPI are very clear,  not shaky, and you will not be sorry. I don't know why the person above is recommending Critic's Choice unless he is the seller?

I am now looking for MPI replacements, so I can get rid of my Critic's Choice.  Unless you have no choice and need the episode, then do it, but I recommend to wait and get MPI.  Good Luck!!!!",1284422400,,579,4.305555555555555
8158216,4,B0009ODWWK,"It's always nice to get a bargain. There is no shortage of the public domain versions of these two perennial Sherlock Holmes favorites on budget home video releases. You can even find other Sherlock Holmes double features. The advantage with the present version from Critics Choice lies in the crispness of the prints. The print and sound quality of ""Terror by Night"" in particular are better than I've experienced on other labels in the price class. Beware the shorter, badly edited version (56 mins) that you will sometimes find of this film. The present version, at 60 minutes, is just right and is told with breathtaking economy. It also has Holmes simply narrate his reasons for suspecting Duncan Bleak (Alan Mowbray) as the culprit. I have seen another version in which this narration occurs over flashbacks from the previous scenes, which can be very confusing!",1222041600,,868,4.993103448275862
