8079671,5,B000ASKKIE,"This was a great dvd. The instructions were easy to follow and it gave lots of different looks to try, not to mention loads of techniques to use to create your own looks... unlike other dvds that just give you 2 or 3 looks. This was more than worth its money and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn face painting...great for Halloween!",1155859200,,350,4.318181818181818
