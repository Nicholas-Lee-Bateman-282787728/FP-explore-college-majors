5926414,3,B00EKGXB7O,"Howdy folks, I like all Westerns and it is my favourite genre. I have collected over twenty from Amazon quite recently, and such wonderful scripts they have. The older fifty year and more as well as the recent new westerns. Thank you. Robert Warren...Melbourne, Australia.",1428796800,,272,5.066666666666666

5926416,4,B00EKGXB7O,"The plot is simple enough: Young boy witnesses the brutal murder of his father by a band of outlaws.  Years later as a young man, he begins his pursuit of those responsible and is determined to act out his revenge on each of the players.  But it's the unexpected plot twists and turns along the way that make this movie unique and add to it's appeal.  The acting and cinematography are excellent.  Probably not a movie for the youngsters...due to some graphic violence and one scene containing partial female nudity---though tastefully done in my opinion.  Remember that this is a South American ""western"", so naturally the dialogue is done in Spanish.  But the DVD gives the viewer the option to select either English or Spanish audio.  Likewise, both English and Spanish subtitles are provided.

So why not a 5-star review?  Because I do not speak Spanish, I selected the English audio.  Unfortunately the English audio is not near as convincing as the actual Spanish audio.  The English-speaking dub-over is...well, to describe it in one word...lame.  The English speaking guys sound like weenies.  Partway through the movie I had to switch-up and revert back to the Spanish-speaking audio and use the English subtitles.

All that said, this movie is a cool action flick with many of the elements one expects to find in a western---the relentless tug-of-war between good and evil, beautiful scenery with lots of dry open country (including desert with saguaro cactus), horses, gunplay, strong language at times, and the pursuit of justice in an otherwise lawless land.",1400976000,3,1571,5.015444015444015

5926458,4,B00EKGXB7O,"Over sixty percent of the viewers on amazon gave this film only one or two stars. I liked it. It is an Argentinian film with actors speaking the language of the land, but I had no problem following the film with the subtitles. The actors look different than American actors (the heroine had bad teeth and many men had unruly beards), wore different cloths than American cowboys, and acted very differently than Americans do in American films. As in many English films, the film-makers do not attempt to choose actors who look good. As in spaghetti westerns, there are many times when people stare without talking. There is lots of action. The color is somewhat more subdued than in American films, but this caused me no problem.
The film had a somewhat mystical - or, perhaps, one might call it a religious - atmosphere at times because some of the people spoke about a saint from time to time and prayed to him, and the saint had a significant part in the film.
One can isolate four plots in the film:
1. A boy sees his father killed by six bandits. Ten years later he seeks revenge.
2. The young man falls in love with a young woman who is terrorized by one of the six bandits who sleeps with her when he wants, against her will, and who also terrorizes and robs many other people. He has a large group of men with guns who work for him.
3. Who is the saint called the pauper, who stays always on his horse, never getting off, and why did he become a saint?

8606381,4,B00EKGXB7O,"RELEASED IN 2010 (and on DVD in the USA in 2013) and directed by Fernando Spiner, Six Shooters chronicles events in Argentina when a gang of six outlaw gauchos murder a boys father and ten years later the young man (Nazareno Casero) sets out to kill em all. Claudio Rissi plays the main heavy while Mariana Anghileri appears as the requisite babe. Pablo Cedrn is on hand as a mysterious horse-riding saint in the mountains.

The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. Surprisingly, the production quality is top-of-the-line on every level, on par with 2011s Blackthorn, another modern South American Western. There are some elements of One Eyed Jacks (1961) and Spaghetti Westerns, but without the goofiness of the latter. This is a thoroughly austere Western thats a little too artsy for its own good, which might make it play better on repeat viewings. There are themes of vengeance, repentance and forgiveness, but some people just CANT be saints. Maybe someday though.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 43 minutes and was shot in Amaicha del Valle, Tucumn, Argentina. WRITERS: Antonio Di Benedetto (story) and Valentn Javier Diment, Santiago Hadida & Spiner (script).
