8579347,4,B00CAYH2P0,"This is the 2011 season of Shark Week, although the blu-ray was released in 2013.  It's a 2 disk set running 301 minutes.  Here is the description from Discovery;

Is the world having a ""shark invasion""? Do sharks hone in on human flesh? Why does each shark species have a unique mode of attack? Study the patterns and unravel the truth behind the most powerful predators of the sea! See what washes up when Great Whites return to the waters where Jaws was filmed, and tour the thrashing blue waters of Shark City, where sharks themselves must fight to survive. With more than five hours of real-life Jaws accounts, scientific research, and razor-sharp, teeth-snapping action, you'll be able to dive in and investigate the stealth and savagery of these fascinating creatures.
Includes:
Great White Invasion
Rogue Sharks
Summer of the Shark
Killer Sharks
How Shark's Hunt
Jaws Comes Home",1404086400,6,886,4.932885906040268
