7334591,5,B011LW42W2,"I had already saw this movie on TV and had ordered it for a Youth Group, but the DVD was damaged and the sound and picture kept going out. We had 65 children that sat through the disruption and to our surprise hung in there.  We were embarrassed because we had opened the package that day at the Church and it was a bad product.  I had to put 5 star because I could not penalize the movie for a defected DVD.

I have waited to late to exchange it so my $24.00 was lost, but not getting it returned for another is on me and not Amazon.",1525737600,,534,3.925925925925926

Amazing teachers control a classroom full of kids on edge and the mad man losing his grip on reality.

7334605,1,B011LW42W2,"What do you do when the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and the like come to your door? Do you invite them in and listen to their spiel of insanity? If you do, then this movie is for you.

For anyone else, stop watching after the bomb goes off and the kids have all made it out.

Although the cover picture for this movie looks like it's advertising some kind of cool horror movie about Omen/Exorcist-type kids, turns out that's not what it is at all. Good thing I watched it free on Prime. Otherwise I'd be wanting a refund.

The first half of the movie is decent enough to keep you watching, and the kids are cute, and it's not bad quality, but then they suddenly throw some weird Book of Mormon kind of thing at you. The last half of the movie is cringey supernaturalist propaganda. It's not even Christian; it's some weird supernatural thing that would make any Christian hit the stop button at the cringey misuse of the religion. I kept watching because I was curious about how bad it was going to get. There is, seriously, no joking, a point in this movie when a woman tells her husband that if he refuses to believe in supernatural beings she'll take the kids and leave him. Woman's face stays soaking wet for the entire second half of the movie, and the look on her face when she looks at her husband -- it's like someone confronting a man who's been caught with child pornography or some other sick thing.

Go ahead and watch the first half. But turn it off at about the point when the kid Jason is back at home watching police shows and the parents and doctor start talking about having ""a big talk."" It leads you to think there's going to be some big reveal, like Jason is a demon who possessed the guy and made him blow up the school or that he had done something to the guy to make him target the school or some other thing. Instead, it's what-the-%#^@ story and from that point, it gets cringier and cringier until the end.

That's FIVE cringeys in one review (SO wink to EACH of those who have already watched the movie).

I did like that in the end credits they put the before and after photos of the kids from the real event, but having them come in all teary-eyed shoving more X Files nonsense in your face ruined that nice touch.",1511308800,,2246,4.323040380047506

7334609,5,B011LW42W2,Skeptics will doubt what happened but the story tells it plainly.  It was a good movie and got me to thinking about my own relationship with God.  The kids stories were great and had the most impact.  Second was the bomb experts analysis of what happened but could not be explained or that should not have happened.  God does work at odds to our way of thinking sometimes.  Prayer is one of the greatest weapons we have against the evil of this world.,1510617600,,451,4.385542168674699

I wonder if all the reviewers that were Negative even bothered to check out the Truth of this story? Reminds me of the Jews that saw the LORD JESUS CHRIST raise Lazurus from the dead. How even tho they just saw a Miracle, all they could do was run and tell the Unbelieveing Pharisees
's what they saw, but didn't believe.
 The man in Hell in Luke 16, said, if one rose from the Dead, my Family would believe. Abraham was right, JESUS CHRIST did Rise from the dead, and men, women, teens, still refuse to believe!",1507507200,,575,4.324074074074074

Poor script writing, some poor acting regardless of the writing. The story itself is interesting for history but the film moves so slow when not needed that many will loose interest. To me the movie never depicted anything extraordinary or heaven intervening as it suggests.  If this movie depicts what really happened that day, it is what one would expect. If this town is as religious based as they say, you could expect children to say angels were in the room with them.",1507507200,,622,4.654545454545454

7334627,4,B011LW42W2,Viewed by my mother who was touched by the religious approach this movie took.  Very touching and emotional.  You will be drawn to feel deeply for the characters. My mother found it strange that this town did not have any people of color represented at all. In all towns in America there is some presence of individuals of different races and or nationalities  - even if adopted or working there and living elsewhere. The director could have done more justice in the movie to show how  people of many other cultures rely upon prayer to deal with life threatening situations. Worth the time to watch and discuss.,1505520000,,611,4.682242990654205

Yes, we are a Catholic family and believe in God and this movie truly fortified our beliefs that the Angels around us are more family then not.

If you want to have your own beliefs reinforced then give this a watch.  I'm sure you'll come away with it the same way other religious types here have.  For those who are not devoutly religious, skip it.

7334645,2,B011LW42W2,"I just got finished watching The Case for Christ which was competitive against most mainstream films you might see. So, maybe I'm a bit hard to please considering I'm not a Christian film fan but I watched a pretty good one hours earlier. I did not realize this would be a Christian film when I saw it suggested, but I assumed there'd be an element of faith. I give it two stars because I do believe in God and at their core these film makers were trying to get that message out....but, the acting was poor, the characters were written as dunces....every single one of them...the women were bigger dunces, the wife of the police officer was a badger and reminded me of a sharknado actress' performance...They lay it on very heavily that there's no other explanation for survival than a miracle...forgetting (as many do) that every day Christian people die horrible, torturous deaths...the Bible says this world is not our home, yet so many people are ""blessed"" to survive as others die horribly... It could be a miracle these children survived...but what about the teacher that didn't? What about every child that gets cancer? The Bible is clear we don't become angels when we die... yet this film names dead loved ones as angels. In other words...this felt like a very Christian American bubble film where God and genies may interchangeable. It's a feel good hallmark movie the second half, but I feel like Christian films and music could go further. They tend to be so manufactured and cheaply presented which does the opposite of drawing non-believers in. Why is it that mainstream/independent films can pull us into the emotions and turmoil but Christian films typically can't? It's not budget. Christian films should not be afraid to be real, gritty, and true...to break away from the Barbie mold...from everyone knowing the answers and guiding the one troubled guy who doesn't...to the belief in a genie God... In short, the acting was poor (besides the bomber and Doris)...the dialogue was cheap. The plot jumps hard into a guilt trip for unbelievers at the end, no smooth flow into the questions, rather, a demand without much exploration of possibilities. The real story is far more compelling. I feel guilty for knocking it down but it's a good example of where most Christian films stand, so fans of the way they are will like this too. I'm an easy target for touching spiritual moments... this had scenes that were intended to cause tears...zilch for me and I had a loved one die in an explosion that haunts me every day. I would check out the Case for Christ though...very relevant, down to earth, easy to relate to...I cried buckets.",1503100800,2,2647,4.794310722100657

7334708,1,B011LW42W2,"This will not show as a verified purchase because I haven't yet viewed the movie.  I usually read reviews before putting a movie on my watch list and like to check out the one star reviews to see if there is anything that would red flag my desire to watch.  But I want to comment on what I've seen here.

It looks like a lot of viewers pan the movie because it is about Mormon Christians; but according to the reviewers, being Mormon,is not being Christian. I imagine such writers if consistent would not watch a Jewish movie or an eastern movie expressing Zen or Buddhist ideas since they are ""not Christian"" as well.  That's their choice.  But I am wondering how Christian it is to attack another Christian denomination as ""Not Christian"" just because their views aren't identical with one's own.  I am putting this ""review"" as a single star rating because that is where I am finding this type of religious bigotry.

Is the definition of a Christian ""one who believes angels are pure spirits who were never humans""?  Is Christianity limited to what is found in the Bible?  My understanding of the term ""Christian"" is ""One who is a follower of Christ.""  More deeply, those who believe Christ was the Son of God who suffered, died and was resurrected in atonement for our sins""  Most believe that only through Christ, in some way or form, can we attain heaven.""  Beyond that the Christian sects are all over the board. Attack the lesser elements as heresy if you must (from your perspective), but don't even suggest that they are not Christians.

Some  believe that all Christian truth is found only in the Bible and nowhere else.  Catholics (are they not Christians as well?) believe God's truth comes through Divine Revelation and Tradition as well as the scriptures.  Calvinists and Reformed believe in predestination.  Some Christians believe in purgatory.  Some claim to not believe in hell.  Catholics believe that Christ is physically present in the Eucharist.  Most Protestants do not.  Mormons don't believe after Christ's coming that God would with suddenly cease to send His spokesmen and prophets to the earth; they believe and that the Lord's prophets still exist.

On the question of the Bible: Some believe it is literal.  Some believe it is accurate for the people it was originally directed toward.  Different denominations may or may not accept the Apocrypha or other ""Books"" of the Bible.  The books of the Bible were written by men, inspired of God.  But the decision of which books were inspired and should be within the Bible was and is a matter of disagreement among believers.  Mormons believe that the single writer of the Book of Mormon was a prophet of God and hence accept it along with the traditional Bible as the word of God.  In fact they often refer to it as ""another testament"" of Jesus Christ -- just as some might likewise accept any of the Apocrypha books.

Can deceased relatives be angels? As a young Catholic, I was taught that angels were ""beings of light"", ""pure spirits"" without bodies.  They could, however, take on a body as demonstrated in various Bible passages. We were also taught that humans who went to heaven were ""saints"" who could intercede for us, facilitate miracles, and yes, even appear to us.  I suspect that Mormons have extended the Catholic definition of angels to include what Catholics call ""saints"".  Would it have made the movie less objectionable to those who complain about dead relatives being angels if it had referred to them as ""saints""?

This is all so shallow. To suggest that Mormons are not Christian because they define angels differently or because they accept another sacred book as legitimate is like saying that Catholics aren't Christian because they believe in the Immaculate Conception; or that Protestants are not Christians because they believe in ""faith without good works"".

If I believe that I can receive whisperings from the Holy Spirit and Divine inspiration from reading the Bible, while you believe that only Church authorities can accurately interpret the meaning of Biblical passages, does that make either of us less Christian?  Yes, I know that there are disagreements within Christianity, but the Mormon's are one of the few that actually proclaim Christ in their name, 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.""

If you are a Christian, or even a God believing non-Christian, you will probably enjoy this movie and be moved by it.

7335050,5,B011LW42W2,"I thought this movie was well done and I love that the whole, true story 'behind the story' is being told that we didn't get in the news. I especially appreciated the updated family photos during the credits at the end of the movie of the children who are now adults with children of their own,and listening to some brief comments from some of them. I'm not one who usually watches intense movies, especially about children being terrorized, so the first half of this was difficult for me. I cried and clenched up even though I already knew all the children and teachers survived before watching it, the acting and writing was that good. The last half of the movie... what the children reported and the numerous 'coincidences' that had to happen to keep everyone safe made all the tension and terror in the beginning worth it. If you don't believe in angels, the power of prayer and divine intervention, this movie just might get you to reconsider those doubts of yours.",1483401600,14,970,4.645348837209302

7335082,5,B011LW42W2,"Great movie, not sure about the scientific evidence of the facts. it is very strange to me what was claimed by all those children.
Difficult to consider it as a coincidence and I am wondering if something was told to those children the weeks before from their teachers.

I wish I could believe there are angels, but I find difficult to understand why some angels should manifest and avoid a disaster like the one of Cokeville, but doing nothing for other disasters where million of children have been killed. See Aleppo, etc. I know this is not the appropriate place for this observation but what I mean is that no scientific analysis and reports are known about the  so called "" Cokeville miracle""

said that, a very nice and powerful movie. It is easy to empathize with the Sheriff and he is definitely a good actor.",1483228800,,818,4.589041095890411

7335302,5,B011LW42W2,"I don't usually review movies but this one deserves a review.

At first I thought this movie was going to go nowhere and then it pulled me in.  I don't usually shed tears during a movie but this True Story actually touched me and really made me think.  I even texted other people and encouraged them to see this movie and they are having difficulty finding it since they don't have Amazon Prime.

I was impressed to hear/see how these elementary kids in such a difficult situation began to pray, this showed that their parents upbringing really was a source of comfort.  One of the kids indicated that he knew god wouldn't let them down.  The older kids at the high school were pulled from class and assembled together to pray too during the crisis.  I was skeptical so I checked the facts on the story and it did happen but the principal was a guy in real life instead of a girl depicted in the movie.  He worried if he would loose his job because he asked the kids to pray with him but there was no recourse taken against him. Furthermore the community also stopped their day and prayed for the safety of the kids.

You never hear this stuff and hearing how the first graders were hesitated to share an experience with angles, for fear of being made fun of, really impressed me.  It was a personal experience they had that comforted them and they didn't want anyone to belittle it. I kinda wish I lived there now.

I was impressed with those kids, per the incident report many had burns, but the bomb investigation afterwards indicated that something turned the explosive force upward away from the children which should have torn them apart though nothing was found that could have done that.

Stream this movie, you will be impressed and my wonder if you too need to give prayer another look.",1480636800,6,1796,4.492307692307692

Our Heavenly Father is so loving and kind.  He cares so much about each of us...That is the foundational truth.  When we reach out to Him with our small faith...He answers in a HUGE way.  Not because our faith is so big...But rather because HE IS SO BIG!  Believe God for miracles in your life. Believe Him for changing your life.  Start today.  Change your perspective.  You have big problems...but God....He has HUGE POWER! He wants to invade your life and change things.  Let him do that today...Humbly bend your knee in submission to Jesus Christ.

7335331,1,B011LW42W2,"So people who are dead come back to warn us? People who are dead are indeed alive. Alive for eternity in heaven. Residing with God or they are residing in Hell. People do not become angels. Actually the saints rule over angels. (1 Cor. 6) Angels are always male. It is appointed once for man to die, then the judgement. The example of the man (in Hell) who begs to go back to warn his family of the horrors that await them because they do not believe, is refused by the Lord Himself. (Luke 16) Anytime the Lord appears on earth prior to the birth of Christ, He is male. There is no reference to Him again on earth until the second coming. *Judgment""..So these beings kids saw, are not the Lord and are not family members. Somehow they contrived this in their minds. Who started it and the other kids just took off with it? The worst part of the movie however is the depiction that somehow a man (the father) becomes a believer because of that testimony of angels. The truth of scripture tells us ""believing"" is believing Christ died for sinners. No where in the movie does this man admit he has sinned against God because he didn't believe the work Christ did for him. So there is no salvation for that man.

That is honest & forthcoming. As a person of deep faith, I often struggle with Whys like that. But I am so grateful that all these people did survive.

I know there are people in that town who didn't believe the ancestor / angel myth, but you don't hear from them.  You just see everyone convert to being faithful as they ""should.""

I am curious as to how he thought he was going to get away... probably didn't care he was such a whacko.  Also of interest is how do crazed idiots like this get people to buy in?  Strange human condition that we see often.  Jonestown comes to mind.  As for the miracle/angel thing... take it or leave it... certainly a fascinating set of circumstances.  That none of these kids died is a miracle in itself.  Check it out.  You don't come away going 'what a waste of time!'

7335532,1,B011LW42W2,"This movie is not a Christian movie.  It is a movie about a Mormon family and Mormon community and their experience with ancestors coming back from the dead to protect their descendants, namely children that find themselves trapped in a classroom with a madman who wants to blow them all up.  Although the producer or director of this movie thought it would be a good idea not to identify this movie as a strictly Mormon movie, I think it was a bad idea.  Mormons are not Christians.  If the makers of this movie think Mormonism is theologically correct why would they down play it.  Christian theology is very different from Mormonism. To the Mormon, the Bible is the Word of God but only as far as it is translated correctly, but the Book of Mormon is God's Word without any conditions or limitations. To the Christian the Bible is the inerrant Word of God and man does not decide what is correctly translated or not as it is God's word not mans. To the Christian the book of Mormon is a heresy. I am not saying this to be intolerant or judgmental.  There are major differences between the Christian faith and Mormonism plain and simple. For instance the Bible makes it very clear that God strongly objects to us messing with the occult, sances and the like to attempt to have contact with the dead. Jesus also tells a parable in which Lazarus and a rich man die.  When the rich man wants to tell his family to change their ways so they would not end up in hades where he was, Jesus says that the rich man was not granted that opportunity.  According to the Bible, the dead do not come back as angels to do anything with the living which begs the question, who were these specters that protected these children and led them out of the building after the explosion? Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11:14 ""And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.  It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve."" And in Galatians 1:8 it says, ""But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under Gods curse!""  These ""angels"" deceived the children at Cokeville because they posed as the children's ancestors when in fact angels are created heavenly beings that have never been nor will ever be human.  ""The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, O you His angels, you mighty ones who do His bidding, who obey the voice of His word!  Praise the Lord, all His heavenly hosts, you His servants who do His will. Praise the Lord, all His works everywhere in His dominion."" Psalm 103:19-22",1474329600,3,2694,4.497950819672131

7335539,5,B011LW42W2,"I had to speak up as it cracked me up how many people were upset that this movie was about faith when the title has the word MIRACLE in it.  What were you expecting??  I cried throughout the movie as it wasn't hard to feel what those children and adults felt.  Shame on people who go in to watch what was obviously touted as a movie about a miracle happening then complain about the movie being about religion.  That would be like me watching a movie that shows the exploitation of underage children and then being made because there are references to pornography in it.  Was the movie low budget and could have used a little help?  Yes, but I don't think anyone made this movie to make money, they did it to share a story and I think they shared it wonderfully.",1474243200,7,762,4.293706293706293

7335633,5,B011LW42W2,"I just finished watching this film, and it is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen depicted.  I am Muslim, and I did not find this film 'exclusive' in the least.  It is an honest re-telling of an experience that happened within a Christian community (hence a Christian perspective) but if anything, I felt this story focused more on a town that took the time to remember and thank God for his numerous blessings, sought his protection, and loved their family and neighbors, which is highly relatable, no matter what your faith background.  I thought it was amazing that so many people in that town, on that day, in such a crisis, took the time to offer sincere prayers for family, friend, and stranger alike - often times in our lives, we forget that sincere connection with God in our daily lives and only remember Him when we are in crisis, but these families welcomed God into their lives every day- I have no doubt that Divine intervention took place that day.  I also found the dad's struggle with his faith very well-depicted.  Nathan Stephens' performance was nuanced yet clearly communicated the doubts with which he was struggling.

7335695,4,B011LW42W2,"A film that relates the true story of the 1986 Cokeville Wyoming hostage crisis, without preaching.  The surrounding farming community, only about 600 strong, was traditionally religious, and some still believe that prayer saved the lives of all the children that day.  The film manages to stay classy, and is well-produced and well-acted, only occasionally sliding into saccharine moralizing. This comes mainly in the last 20 minutes or so. Still, it is tolerable, even for the non-religious person who likes to think about supernatural intervention in our lives, the power of the unseen, and true accounts.  NOTE:  Amazon needs to be careful about the writers of ""Trivia"".  For this film, some idiot armchair quarterback whined that a clock on the wall said the wrong time. Actually, the reviewer is himself wrong: he assumes that the school day had just started, but in fact the incident began at about 1 pm and continued for two and a half hours . .. in which case the clock would be accurate.",1472860800,,997,4.910714285714286

Whether or not angels actually helped the folks in the classroom to survive the awful madman and his wife is kind of beside the point in this mess. The way the story is presented, chopped up, and not concluded in many ways, really makes you wonder what really happened.
The actors appear to be getting poor direction as to how to play their lines, and the vacant stares of most of the characters does not convey the terror of the situation. The conclusion does not make a feasible case for what may have happened in the classroom or anything much about the psyche of the madman and his wife.

I'm always amused when Christians see their idols Christ and Mary, or muslims follow their quran which teaches them to kill or any other silliness. I believe in God, one God and not idols, so, this was a great movie up until the (don't want to give anything away) conclusion of the hostage scene but the rest was more Christian silliness trying once again to validate their idolatry. If these religious freaks aren't screaming that everyone who doesn't worship jesus is going to hell, then they are making up some ""miracle"" stories that never happened. I'm glad those kids and teachers are okay ..God without a doubt watched over them but sick to death of the propaganda bs that anything other than God saved those people.

7336217,2,B011LW42W2,"I really wanted to like this film. I was pretty disappointed. Christense took on a tough task trying to adapt the story to the big screen, and his attempt in telling a coherent tale mostly succeeded. We get to the heart of teh action fairly quickly in the film, which then tries to explain it as a miracle in the last half.

But it was a little too centered on one man's faith journey. The central character, Ron Hartley, isn't very sympathetic. If he wasn't used as the storytelling device, it wouldn't matter, but the audience is supposed to relate to his reluctance to believe. Reluctance is natural, Hartley just comes around in the most forced and contrived ways.

Sarah Kent was great as Claudia Hartley, and the kids delivered mostly great performances.

One final thing. In a period piece, some attempt should be made to periodize. This event happened in the 1980s, but vehicles and dress were a strange ensemble of everything from the mid 1990s to the present.",1469404800,4,969,4.688235294117647

However, it was very entertaining to those who have had shields of prejudice fall from our eyes.  I to have had angels that have not only protected me, but like the sheriff that found it so hard to believe that there is a God, or that maybe if there is one that he wanted nothing to do with me.  I too have seen those shields fall from my own eyes and been filled with a knowledge that he is real and that he loves me.  Yes a terrible sinner like me.  I have been bathed in the light of his angels and have knelled at his feet and asked forgiveness.  I no longer doubt weather or not he is there, I know he is and I do not pray as much as I should or attend church on a regular basis. but all i have to do is close my eyes and pray a little prayer and I am right back beside him, and he is watching over me, always and forever.",1469404800,3,977,3.7783251231527095

7336319,2,B011LW42W2,"The acting is passable and the storyline loosely reflects the official record of the actual event.  Calling it ""miraculous"" that a low yield gasoline bomb (rigged up by a rank amateur) misfired and achieved only partial detonation seems a bit of a stretch.  If everyone had walked away unscathed after the explosion then maybe attaching ""miraculous"" would have been more understandable.  With 79 injuries (about half of the hostages) of varying degrees of seriousness, resulting from both the bomb and gunshots, I think ""lucky"" is more appropriate.  Then again, the burn victims might not have felt that lucky.

However, the target audience almost certainly believes in angels and divine intervention already, so the movie should be an enjoyable affirmation for them.  So far as confirmation of the angelic or divine, anyone not predisposed to believe in such will almost certainly remain unmoved by the anecdotal ""evidence"" presented in the film.",1469059200,2,947,5.28

7336323,2,B011LW42W2,"I'm afraid I didn't find it believable or convincing. It wasn't as horrible as some religious propaganda films are. The characters seemed decent enough. But there were subtle political messages in there (""I may get fired for this, but let's pray"") that detracted. And the fact that 100% of the families were all Christian seemed propaganda too. No Jews? No Muslims? Only people who believe in Jesus? So it's a preachy, one-side, not convincing film. But it was done in good faith I guess, so I wouldn't give it a one star.",1469059200,4,522,4.684782608695652

7336328,4,B011LW42W2,"Very inspirational movie that speaks on the power of prayer and the disbelief that will often follow miracles of God. Faith-based movies are tough to judge because while miraculous [fiction] may be entertaining, present-day miracles will reveal every ounce of doubt inside. That is one of the themes that is played out in this movie. The disbelief in God, even when His works happen right in front of you.

The only reason why this couldn't get five stars is because while the acting was fine, the dialogue had its corny moments. I always wish for more believable writing in Faith-based movies. The element of truth behind this real-life event strongly challenges people's skepticism, though. Through over a hundred eye witnesses, the events are described in detail to be a work of God. It's our choice whether or not to believe it.",1468972800,,832,4.900709219858156

Yes, the acting sucked and yes, the wife did threaten to leave her husband (police officer) if he didn't go to church, pray, believe in god, etc. I don't knock anyone's ability to believe. But this was just sodden tear-jerker crap. God/Jesus chose to save this small town's children, but meanwhile the world is going down the toilet.

What I did do, after it was over, was google the story. Read numerous sources, because the religious angle is predominate. Yes, It happened in 1986. Really small town mostly comprised of Mormons. The angels didn't come to be public knowledge until way after the event and after victims spend much time together recovering. yeah. just not my thing.",1468800000,18,845,4.70945945945946

7336392,5,B011LW42W2,"From the news, there was much said about this situation, but none of it came close to describing what really happened.  This movie touched on so many emotions.  The craziness that comes from hate.  The craziness that comes from living with someone enveloped in hate and losing sight of what is real.  The fear of the hostages and the faith that lead them to be strong in the face of death.  Most amazing was that these were children who turned to God in a moment of desperate hope.  And the underlying search of a man to restore his faith when his occupation caused him to doubt when God lets bad things happen.  If God took away every problem that is in the world, where would be faith?",1468800000,8,687,4.362204724409449

7336394,5,B011LW42W2,"This movie, based on the true story that occurred in Cokesville, WY in 1986, adheres very closely to the actual events that took place. For those who saw the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" episode back in the 90's covering this event, the story is already a familiar one. For those who have not seen that or are not aware of this story, it is nothing short of inspirational. What secular non-believers will see as a series of fortuitous events is, as the parents in the movie proclaim - too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence. Too many ""coincidences"" came about to ensure that all 154 people, all stuffed into one small room, manage to survive relatively unharmed. The ONLY possible answer is that a MIRACLE occurred!

The movie itself is moderately paced and it easily keeps your attention. The acting is well done (one little girl is just too adorable) and the production value rivals some mainstream Hollywood drivel.

One reviewer on Netflix criticized this movie because of ""... the exclusivity of Christianity."" This movie is based on REAL LIFE. You cannot take a true story and embellish it with all aspects of Political Correctness just in the interest of inclusiveness. To do so waters down the message and perverts truth. ""What about Columbine, Connecticut, etc."" that reviewer asks. Perhaps it is because in this school, God was welcomed with open arms... not so with Columbine or Connecticut or any other public school today.

Others here on Amazon have rated this 1-star because it is a Christian film. People... MIRACLE is IN the title of this movie and the description explicitly describes a ""miraculous, heavenly intervention"". If this isn't your kind of movie, then don't watch it in the first place. But then to rate it 1-star on top of that. That would be like me reviewing romance novels - which I NEVER read or like!

7336444,4,B011LW42W2,"This is a 'wonder'-ful story; an adaptation of a real-life event that occurred in the quiet American Midwest on a typical Friday morning, in 1986.  The wonder is that this is just a moment in time - another clip of mankind's brutality to his own-kind, an unfortunate ongoing happenstance since the days of the caveman.  The wonder is this is a civilized nation's 'home-grown stuff;' arriving long before today's (c2016) multiple social-media platforms, the ongoing incidents' and their brutal escalations (rather local or otherwise).  It may (perhaps should) cause you to stop and wonder how and why civilization have evolved into so much more turmoil that (cynicism applied) as a whole - no-one and no-place, child nor adult is truly 'safe' anymore, anywhere, anytime.  That's a sad state of evolution.  But let your cynicism dissipate; study the contents of this story. If  you are a religious type, the storyline makes you stop and ponder.

I am not putting down the message, however when they pan to the actor and try to have them make angel face while talking about the ladies in white, it loses the effect. I believe them less, not more. I think the same film would have done better with actors who inhabited their characters more than preached their message. After a weak beginning, they took their time setting up the 'facts' of the story, then rushed to preach what was hard to belief. If they had maintained the pacing and integrity of the characters, it would have been at least a 3.5-4 for an independent production. The kids though did an awesome job, and the villain's wife was great. Everyone else just didn't seem to believe their own parts.

7336470,5,B011LW42W2,"On May 16, 1986 in the sleepy town of Cokeville, Wyoming, a madman took an entire elementary school hostage. The Cokeville Miracle follows the true story of that fateful day, and the investigators account as he looks into evidences of a purported miracle.  This was an amazing movie!  One that will leave you knowing the power of prayer.  After this tragedy, some of the children were interviewed separately and they all had an experience that there were angels with them.  They all prayed, they were not told to pray, they just reached out to a higher power and were saved.  I know from first hand experience the power of prayer. This is a remarkable movie",1468540800,5,657,4.678260869565217

Acting is not that good, filming/directing not that good, so if those things are important to you, it might not be the movie for you. If you have an hour or so to kill, enjoy true stories of faith-based storyline, then it is worth watching. There were a lot of events that happened in this story, and it is hard to believe there was not divine intervention when you hear the children's versions. Too much to be considered coincidence.

I feel like it insults my intellect when people insist, like in these ratings, that some movie will send me to my knees and giving up all that I took many years learning, to fall back into some dark age thinking. Many religions,which these people refuse to learn about, teach about all kinds of ways which great things come to people. It is called Karma. I don't believe in Angles but I have seen Karma in action.  I kind of laughed at the little kid way of this movie; ""now I lay me down to sleep."" forced on little kids and how it affects their ability to see reality.

It is based on a true incident of a deranged man and wife taking over a grammar school and preparing to kill all the children.

This story is not just about one miracles, it covers a lot of miracles that happened that day during this mad man's quest. And make no mistake, this man was as mad as a hatter! And even though I really felt for the children that were held hostage, I really felt for the daughter of the mad man--the idea that she was going to have to live with what her parents did for the rest of her life. I can imagine that she needed a lot of help herself after all of this was over--hope she is doing OK now. I plan to do some research on this tragedy & also what happened to the daughter. This movie will make you think. If you have any doubts about weather God and angels exists, then this movie should help you to make up your mind.

Many today fight for their 'rights' to have and use guns but Jesus said that if you 'live by the sword, you shall die by the sword'. Many Christians reject this and prefer the writings of the Constitution of the United States as if it pre-empts God's Word and His Spirit today. God says He will protect us but they refuse to believe He will do this without the use of violence. This REAL STORY stands as a testimony that God made all arrangements to ensure that no further violence would be perpetrated and as you have noticed at the end, only 2 people lost their lives, the 2 evil ones who sought to destroy all those children and their teachers. Prayer to God in faith changed everything and because they 'believed' God would rescue them, He did!",1466553600,2,947,4.380681818181818

But I didn't expect it to focus so heavily much on Christian's belief which is a little bit turn off because it does not feel real half of time. The reason behind the bomb and hostage at the school is a little bit unclearly, and there are some holes there and there. Where is food and water if the criminals plan on stay for ten days? Also the act of actor/actress does not make the event itself really happen. All children in the classroom suddenly calmly praying at the same time which is kind of odd. If the children were crying, or feel scared or something and then do prayer together, then I would find it more believable. I feel it give mixed message and one I do not like that there are godly reason for the event to happen. I know this is just a movie that ""inspire"" by that event, but I could not take that event serious through the movie.",1466380800,,941,4.175824175824176

7337147,2,B011LW42W2,"I rarely write reviews but felt I had to for this movie. This movie is about a true event of a school held hostage by two deranged people armed with guns and a bomb.  It is an armature production and it shows but it is not terrible. The story-line could have been tighter, and characters could have been better developed. The acting is okay but nothing to be amazed at. There is a better made for tv dramatization  featuring Richard Thomas as the bomber called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Save-the-Children/dp/B0000APVJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Save the Children</a>.

The message behind the movie is that God, or at least angels, are real and  miracles do happen.  Spoiler alert: Everyone but the two criminals survive and those who make it out alive claim angles helped them.  Granted these are mostly children who claim these things but who are we to argue that children might have made stuff up.  When the kids start identifying dead family members from photo albums as the angels who saved them most of the grown ups are astounded. How could the children know these dead relatives?  Could it be because they have seen these photos before, I mean it's not like this is the first time the parents have let the kids look at photo albums before.  Or is this a thing people do, withholding dead relative's identity until a kid sees and angel and then bring out the album to see if the kid can pull the angels face out of a photo line up?

As cynical as I may be I actually want to believe in miracles like this.  I do in fact want to believe in a world where God intervenes in terrible circumstances to make things better.  Part of my problem is that it does indeed seem like there were divine forces at work here to save these kids.  So where was God when Sandy Hook happened?  This show makes a big deal out of the hostages praying, the families praying, the community, and even the world praying for the safety of the kids.  So did the Sandy Hook victims get the short end of the stick because the gun man killed them before people had a chance to pray to God for help?  To their credit there is a tid-bit line at the end of the movie where they acknowledge that they don't know why some people live through terrible things and others don't.  So at least their as baffled as the rest of us. So I guess that's a problem I have with God rather than this movie.

But that brings me to thing I hated in this movie which was the portrayal of the Dad-cop struggling with his faith crisis.  It was insulting to him and to everyone else who struggles with issues of belief.  From the beginning the guy has lost his faith because of what he has seen as a cop.  What does his wife and family do?  Do they rally around him in his soul's time of need.  No they sneer at him and guilt trip him as if to say ""What is wrong with you? Stop being such a jerk.""  Which is really the movie's message to all people struggling with their faith.  The wife even goes as far in the end to essentially say to him ""I love you and your the best man I know, but if you don't believe in god then I don't think I want you to be a part of my life or our children's lives.  Get with the God program or you'll loose us."" Gee with you holding that over his head how can he say no.  As I myself have struggle with my own faith and been on the receiving end of people doing the same thing to varying degrees I hate to see this movie propped up like a paragon.  This is not how you should treat the people you love who are struggling with their faith.  It minimizes their pain and then mocks them for it.

All in all, decent dramatized portrayal of the Cokeville incident, but mostly a rude and demeaning slap in the face to anyone who dares doubt God.",1466208000,7,3774,4.357653791130186

The school was still closed and his risk for blood clots would've been to high to return to taking care of children. But oh wait this is a movie. That used partial facts to make idiot people out there believe that innocent childrens prayers can save them. No. This couple had 0 intentions of actually killing the kids.

You feel the connection with the people in the story, especially if you a parent or have been involved in education.

Incredible that our beloved relatives in the spirit world know what is happening to their mortal relatives.
The children's story, or is it their testimony, didn't change with time and the bomb's explosion was irregular but they add up; against the law of physics. Then again it isn't against the law of physics if what they had testified are true.

Then again they were all hallucinating from inhaling excessive amount of gasoline vapor, and in their high state - their combined mental energy were able to shape the path of the explosion and the lunatic from shooting at them except for the teacher, not to forget they also controlled the trajectory, timing of the exploding ammunition too so that one got hit by 5.56mm rounds.

I think their testimony is a lot easier to accept - miraculous.
Angels (our guardian) live as does God our Saviour Jesus Christ in this confused, immoral, greedy and self-centered world.

The acting was magnificent, as was the pacing, the music etc.  And that is to say nothing of the wonderful message and spirit of the movie.  I appreciated how at the end, the movie makers did acknowledge that not every hostage situation ends in such a positive way.  In this situation, every single innocent person lived, and only the perpetrators died.  That is not always the case.  Even so, there is a God, and it's important to note His hand in the miracles that do happen.

Showing the perspective of the officer who struggled was a great move by the movie makers as well.  His journey from doubt to belief was admirable.  All of us doubt, and many disbelieve at different points in our lives, and showing him, a good decent man struggling the way he did, yet finally coming to his own understanding was very hopeful.

I did wonder a little at some things, not enough to lower the rating.  The van the bad guys used seemed a little modern.  It didn't look like a van that would be used in 1986.  But I could be wrong, and it didn't affect my appreciation of the story itself.",1453507200,,1118,4.3951219512195125

Any Christian who views this will undoubtedly love it. And any non-Christian who views it, might have a life-changing experience.
Many of these types of movies are cheesy, campy, and have some less-than-stellar acting and directing in it. I'm happy to say that was NOT the case in this movie.  It was very well done even from a technical side.  I don't want to give anything away so let's just say...prepare to be surprised and inspired!

In reality, the film makers downplayed the miracle(s) to make the movie more ""real"" for skeptics and cynics.  Fiction is limited by what's possible; real life isn't.

7337356,4,B011LW42W2,"I don't know how anyone could end this movie and not believe that God is real and miracles exist.

This movie is based on actual events that occurred in Cokeville, Wyoming 1986.  I wasn't familiar with this story before hearing about the movie coming out.  I was a young teenager in 1986 and not paying attention to the world around me much past how it effected me directly.  But this story deserves to be heard.  It is a movie that speaks of tragedy and triumph.  It is based on faith in God and the miracles that surrounded a school full of children when a terrorist took over.

As I watched this movie, I was filled with all kinds of emotions.  As a parent, one of my worst nightmares is to have something like this happen to one of my children.  I can't even imagine how scary this day must have been for all involved.  I was touched by the efforts of the teachers who were willing to sacrifice themselves to save those children and did whatever they could that day to protect them.  My heart was full of gratitude for the miracles that the people of Cokeville received that day.

It's hard to understand why some people get miracles like this and some do not.  There are so many instances of terror in schools that do not end this way.  It breaks my heart.  But while I do not know why miracles happen for some and not for others, I do know that when miracles happen, we should celebrate and acknowledge them as such.

I didn't know this until this movie was coming out, but there is a family in my neighborhood that was involved in this.  They had two children in this school on this day.  That really brought this story closer to home for me.  It's been great to hear about their support for this movie.

This was such a good movie.  It enlightened me, it made me feel.  I ended the movie feeling so emotional but also so grateful.

Content:  I would not let my young teenage daughter watch this.  She is very sensitive to things like this and because I know her, I know it would scare her for sure.  It is rated PG-13 for a good reason.  While there isn't anything overly graphic, the scenes are portrayed very realistically and may frighten children.",1443744000,4,2159,4.35929648241206

7337370,5,B011LW42W2,"TRUE, Faith Promoting, Suspenseful Masterpiece

On May 16th 1986 a mentally crazed man, with enough explosives to completely destroy the building and kill all of the people inside, occupied an elementary school in Cokeville, Wyoming.  He held all of the 154 people in the school hostage and threatened to blow up the school if he did not receive a two million dollar ransom for each of the 136 children.

What happened in the school was beyond belief for everyone, from believers to atheists. Prayers were answered. When the bomb went off, every one of the 154 hostages were able to escape by following directions from what we would call guardian angels; deceased relatives who came to them. The children said it was angels that saved them. The only people to die in the explosion were the bomber and his wife.

This TRUE story was confirmed by dozens and dozens of witnesses who were actually in the school when it was blown up. The Cokeville Miracle is as intense as any film. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout this unforgettable motion picture. Even the details portrayed actually happened. There was no screenplay. The director told me he just filmed the story as it was given to him by those who were in the school.

Acting in the film is superb. One memorable performance was a teacher who volunteered with the captor to give her life for the children. It was also a conversion experience for an unbelieving man whose story is told in the film.

Evidence in the film for life beyond the grave is unquestionable because there were so many witnesses, because of how the people were saved, and because it is true from beginning to end.  Seeing the film will be a faith promoting experience for people of all Christian faiths, and non-Christian faiths as well. It could also be a conversion experience for skeptics and non-believers.
