2667817,5,B000JBXHI2,"This is yet another series we inherited from the British back in the early 70s.  Here it ran all in 1 season while there it took 2 (as usual).  Tony Curtis a self made rich kid from a poor family in Brooklyn, Roger Moore the typical British aristocrat.  Together they team up to tackle cases the law won't or couldn't touch around the globe.  Both sets were originally released by A&E separately (I got them both from Marketplace Sellers for a tad less than the price for this combo deal,) and if the photograph is true, all your are getting is the 2 separate sets for a combined reduced price.  It's not like the previously (some more recent than others) released Megasets of Nero Wolfe, Space 1999, Prisoner, Danger Man/Secret Agent (both original and now the new coming combo of that) or Upstairs Downstairs/Thomas & Sarah set, so my advice get the best deal you can.  If this turns out to be an actual complete megaset rather than just a nice deal for the 2 separate sets in 1 piece of cellophane, I will modify my review. As a program, it's a rare find, as a ""deal"", watch all 3 listings carefully, VERY CAREFULLY.  UPDATE:  If you really want the full series in 1 set, you can get it from the UK store in a special edition ""9 disc set"".  Kicker is you will also have to buy a multi region player.  Fortunately several Amazon sellers here in the USA store for great prices (I have 1 en route as I type this).:-)",1169942400,13,1416,4.349809885931559

2667824,4,B000JBXHI2,"This was one of my favorite shows 45 years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it on this DVD release. Tony Curtis and Roger more cast together was the perfect buddy team.  Roger More excelled as representing established wealthy playboy type while Tony Curtis excelled in portraying urban New York working class image of self made rich man. Both had the same goals in life, party,have fun,meet women and create lots of problems in the pursuit of these ends. There's a good time to be had by all watching this series made during an era where everything wasn't portrayed so dark and somber as it is now.
The DVD quality is quite good although I wouldn't go as far as to say it is as good as the early A&E release of this series.",1493510400,6,719,4.406015037593985

2667834,3,B000JBXHI2,"The premise of The Persuaders is simply this; two wealthy playboys- a British aristocrat and ex-race car driver is paired with an ex-NYC street urchin turned millionaire by an unscrupulous judge and set to traipsing about Europe solving crimes.  My recollection of watching Roger Moore and Tony Curtis during the series broadcast days was that the snappy repartee between them was a lot funnier and clever; turns out its not when viewed in 2017.

  The musical score apart from the dirge-like opening theme is mostly by way of Ringling Brothers.  Its not all terrible but much of its just goofy and just annoying and detracts from the action on the screen.  John Barry's certainly done better work than this.

  Theres plenty of cartoonish violence, mostly rollicking fist fights where no one has a mark on them afterwards and bloodless shootings and stabbings.  Its not as bad as the old movie serials from the 50s where every stick of furniture in a room would be destroyed in a brawl but its not far removed.  When accompanied by music by Looney Tunes its eye rolling.

  Since its the early 70s the wardrobe is cringe worthy.  Moores Lord Sinclair comes off better with mostly tailored suits with the requisite wide lapels and ties and occasionally an ascot (OK, he is an aristocrat).  Poor Tony Curtis however must have angered the costume department.  First of all, his Danny Wilde is a glove fetishist to rival Mary Todd Lincoln and hes got gloves on in most every scene regardless of the time of year or location.  The vast majority of his outfits are so foppish they would have embarrassed Liberace!  Its like wardrobe was told they were shooting a 20th century version of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Curtis was playing Sir Percy.

  Wikipedia sources say that Curtis and Moore didn't get along particularly well during the filming and that Curtis was over indulging on marijuana at the time.  Supposedly they used real champagne on the set and there was plenty of imbibing which may explain a lot.  The plots are ridiculous and repetitive so its no wonder that the plug was pulled after one season.  Recommended only if you're nostalgic for cheesy TV early 70s style.",1487203200,7,2175,4.797843665768194

2667839,4,B000JBXHI2,"OK, it's a bit hammy with two rich playboys, the self-made American tough guy and the effete and wealthy British Lord no less. But give the show a chance because it's not as bad as it sounds. Tony Curtis and Roger Moore are two highly talented actors who take what could have been a boiler-plate premise and made it work through sheer ability on their part. There's also the natural chemistry between the two stars. I don't know how they got on in real life, but on the screen they really seem to be enjoying themselves.

2667877,5,B000JBXHI2,"A classic British/American TV series that should have lasted more than one season like a lot of great classic shows! At least they made
enough episodes that you can enjoy over and over without getting tired of them. Roger Moore and Tony Curtis may not have been best
friends off the set but when the cameras were rolling they were rocking! They had a great chemistry and Curtis one liners and sense of
humor from both of them really made this one work. The stories are well written directed and of course acted with some great co stars
from british and American TV and movies. There's plenty of action but also mystery and twist and turns in the plots. The cars Moore and
Curtis drive are just as much part of the show and used in some great driving stunts. I remember watching this as a kid on ABC and
then it was GONE! and I only saw a few of those rerun 'movies' of just episodes thrown together for TV! I have had this for about 10
years and still enjoy it like it was a new show. It was just too good not to last longer. One of the few show as a kid that is actually as
good as I remember like Thriller, Hitchcock, Rockford, Baretta, Alias Smith and Jones, Barnaby Jones etc...great shows that live on.
Network TV or movies have nothing that can match this show today! Highly recommend this series for real TV movie fans.",1434585600,,1326,4.286852589641434

2667885,5,B000JBXHI2,"The Persuaders! was a 70's nugget produced in England. The best part of this series was the interplay between it's two stars Tony Curtis and Roger Moore. They seem to be having a great time trying to constantly out-do each other while trying to solve cases the legal authorities originally couldn't. Moore plays Lord Bret Sinclair,born and bred a British aristocrat, while Curtis plays Danny Wilde,a self-made millionaire from the slums of Brooklyn. Exotic locales and women are part of the fun in this tongue-in cheek adventure series. The cultural differences between the two are never more apparent than when they're camping out on Bret's estate in one episode. While Danny sleeps with only a blanket for protection, Bret has a deluxe tent complete with mini-bar and freezer. The only problem I have with the set is it only contains 24 episodes, due to the fact it wasn't poular in the U.S. and production was stopped after just one season. A must for Moore fans to see what he did to bide his time between The Saint and James Bond.",1247961600,7,1035,4.7555555555555555

2667887,5,B000JBXHI2,"The 1971 series ""The Persuaders"" is nothing short of a television equivalent  to a truck load of precious gems. With an, at that time in British television uheard of, huge waddle of cash thrown at the production of this series (around 100K pounds per episode), they had the means to make ""The Persuaders"" big. And they did. The signature theme music by John Barry and the colourful introduction of the characters that comes with it. The lavishness of the sets and on-location shootings, the signature Bahama Yellow Aston Martin DBS and the red Dino Ferrari, the scotch.

They managed to create a world, a believable world, in which British peer Lord Brett Sinclair, in the comely shape of Roger Moore, and American diamond-in-the-rough oil millionaire Danny Wilde, played to perfection by Tony Curtis, would solve cases that the courts could not, or would not, handle all while keeping up a busy globetrotting playboy lifestyle with fast cars, fast women, gambling, and plenty of fine cognac. It is a safe and entertaining world to get immersed into with proper fistfights, loads of drink, and beautiful women. Much like James Bond as it were.

But the biggest boon, by far, is the humour, much of the which derives from the observations of differences between the British and the Americans as seen in the relationship between, as well as the laddish and playful wit of, the two main protagonists.

""The Persuaders"" may seem old and tired and a bit ridiculous to modern eyes, like indeed any old TV series might, but I don't think it is. The stories are well written, well acted, and well directed. It is an innocent and interesting world in which Sinclair and Wilde work their magic, and I think, a world we all would like to be in (in some way or other).

It's a shame that Sir Lew Grade, co-creator of the series, was so keen on breaking into the American market (where the series fared badly), that he cancelled the series after only one season although it was doing very well in the rest of the world. Although I guess that only makes it that much more precious, doesn't it?

In a word: definitely one for the lads (lads here meaning men and women). Highest possible recommendation.",1214092800,44,2187,4.727034120734908
2667888,5,B000JBXHI2,"The full set available in the UK and on amazon.co.uk was also released in 2006, but it is not this A&E basic compilation.  It has two extra DVDs, including a great ""The Persuaders Revisited"" documentary, that visits Tony Curtis in 2006 in his present home in Las Vegas and Sir Roger Moore in his home in Monte Carlo.  Between the two of them, I think Moore has got the better idea for a residence... :-))

Anyhow, at about the same price as this U.S. version is, plus having the PAL system's better colors and extra line resolution, getting the series from the UK site is a better option.  Make sure that the DVD player is PAL capable (most of them are) and that it is region-free.

8149570,4,B000JBXHI2,"The Persuaders was a production made by ITC entertainment and appeared on British television in the early 1970s. This action-adventure series was perhaps the most expensive production brought to television at the time. The filming was location based in England, Italy and France, and brought the pairing of Roger Moore and Tony Curtis. They played two very different characters who are reluctantly brought together to solve mysteries and cases that the police or the judiciary could do nothing about. Tony Curtis's character was Danny Wilde, a self-made man who grew up in the slums of New York City and eventually made his fortune. While his partner Lord Brett Sinclair (Roger Moore) is a refined British nobleman, Oxford-educated, ex-British Army and former racing driver. Danny Wilde drives a Ferrari Dino 246 GT while Brett Sinclair drives an Aston Martin DBS they both had personalised number plates. The one thing they have in common is that they are playboys who meet while on holiday on the Cote d'Azur. Unfortunately, their first meeting ends in a fistfight. Due to the intervention of a judge, they have the choice of either going to jail or help him sort out a case. As their adventures continue, either they stumble into situations or into other accidental occurrences; this then develops, into a case. For me the most memorable part of the show was the split screen opening sequences, as we see a montage of their lives which comes to realization, from their childhood to the present, this is played out in a series of short sequences combining photographs with a live image and various news clippings denoting their varied lifestyles. To further, enhance the sequences there is the very memorable and catchy signature theme created by John Barry.

There was ever only one season of the series, this is because Roger Moore was offered, and accepted the role of James Bond, in the Bond franchise. It is important to note that the powers that be were prepared to finance and put together a second series. It is said Tony Curtis and Roger Moore off-screen did not seem to get on well, and various anecdotal statements by their co-stars and alike attest to this fact. Each episode was like a mini film and in some ways; there is no surprise as each episode swallowed up the equivalent budget of a whole series. While the series may seem dated by today's standards this was a popular show, at the time and still much loved by former viewers and fans. The Persuaders can be considered the last of a cycle of adventure themed series that began a decade or so earlier with Patrick McGoohan's Danger Man.

This was a good series where the narrative may not have been that diverse, but as a whole series had an impact. Not to sound repetitive but those opening title sequences with the montage of each protagonist's life and the corresponding haunting title music by John Barry make it a classic of 1970s television.",1512604800,2,2919,4.824351297405189
