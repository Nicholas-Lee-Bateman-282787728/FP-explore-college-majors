7879643,5,6304959117,Kids can't seem to help but like Blue and all her friends.  They are bright and colorful.  The songs are interesting and repeated each episode to make it easy for the children to memorize.  The arts and crafts on this tape can easily be replicated at home with your own children.,1078531200,2,279,4.431372549019608
7879644,5,6304959117,"I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Blue's Clues. However, what is important is that my son is. HE enjoys it and has learned from this video.
My son can tell you what colors will mix into what colors (red and white make pink) and it was because of this video. He has experimented and learned other combinations since then. Thanks to this video for stimulating his curiousity about colors and mixing colors.
For this reason alone it's worth five stars! However, the whole video is like this, full of learning and great starting points for experimenting and learning more about arts and crafts.
Very fun.
Enjoy.",1028246400,7,611,4.5636363636363635
