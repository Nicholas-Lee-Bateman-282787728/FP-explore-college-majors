8111393,2,B000EMGF1M,"The presence of Mariangela Melato and the resemblance of leading man Michele Placido to Giancarlo Giannini evoke memories of Wertmuller's great early films like Love And Anarchy, The Seduction Of Mimi, and Swept Away (and you can add her masterpiece, Seven Beauties, for the association with Giannini). Unfortunately, that's where the similarities end. Summer Night is a tired rehash of the class war themes of Swept Away without any of the originality of the latter (perhaps if this film had been made before Swept Away, then it would have been tagged as the original one and Swept Away a pale imitation). Melato plays a rich environmentalist who kidnaps a Sicilian gangster (of course, from a class well below hers) who himself had been responsible for the kidnapping of a number of rich people for lucrative ransom. Melato's plan is to recoup the ransom money in exchange for her prisoner. Of course, the tables are more or less turned when she winds up in bed with her captive. Interestingly, an almost misogynistic view of the world from a female director (men really hold power over women - all women really want/need is good sex). Not much to recommend aside from the beautiful scenery.",1341014400,,1193,4.910891089108911
8111394,5,B000EMGF1M,"I watched the movie, ""Swept Away"" with this beautiful Italian actress, Mariangela Melato, in which she is mistreated by a man (with my daughter who was repelled by the violence the character had to endure, it's a comedy; my daughter took it too literally).  Well this movie, ""Summer Night"" is the flip side where the female inflicts pain and suffering on a male and I know my daughter will love it! The same, lovely, blond Italian is a riot as she spews forth politically incorrect class warfare on her victim. She is super rich, he is supposedly poor.  In Italian dialogue, the subtitles are very good but you have to pay attention and read them as fast as they come at you.  You will want to watch this a lot more than once and you will laugh you butt off. It's that funny.  The ending is where she gets her comeuppance and I found that excruciatingly funny too. Not for those viewers who aren't happy unless the same old Hollywood hacks have starring roles, this movie is a stimulant to the intellectuals among us.  European viewers won't need any help with this; they will feel right at home. I love you, Mariangela Melato!",1305849600,3,1127,4.532019704433497
8111395,4,B000EMGF1M,"Lina Wertmuller's ""Summer Night"" (1986) or ""Notte d'estate con profilo greco, occhi a mandorla e odore di basilico"" (Summer Night, with Greek Profile, Almond Eyes and Scent of Basil) could pass as the companion piece to ""Swept Away,"" made 12 years earlier. Both deal with socio-political conflict and sexual power-play with the lovely Mariangela Melato the central character in each. In ""Summer Night,"" the tables are turned, with the man in chains and the woman holding the leash. Again Melato, now middle-aged, plays a rich upper-class woman, Signora Bolk. But this time she gets to kidnap Giuseppe 'Beppe' Catania (Michele Placido), a leftist rebel who has made a habit of kidnapping and holding members of the upper-class for ransom. She intends holding him for ransom instead, demanding the return of all the money he has extorted from the rich over the years, some 100 million lira. Holding him chained, blindfolded and bound in her luxurious private villa on the island of Sardinia, she develops an increasingly amorous interest in him, to the point where when he points out that prisoners in jail are allowed conjugal visits, she hires Swedish callgirls to cater to his needs and then anonymously joins them in their little orgy. It is much lighter in tone than ""Swept Away,"" perhaps because it isn't so brutal in its depiction of sexual violence and also perhaps because this time it is the man in chains and we don't feel so guilty laughing about that, then when it is the woman being subjugated. Also, Beppe plays it very tongue-in-cheek and doesn't look like he minds in the least being in chains. Just like in ""Swept Away,"" the twist at the end finds the man and woman exchanging places. Only this time there is a ""happier"" ending with Melato carried off on horseback by her kidnapper. Not a politically correct ending in this day and age but fully in keeping with Wertmuller's thumbing her nose at society. Lina Wertmuller may have done it all before in ""Swept Away"" but she is never less than entertaining and this revisit is replete with sumptuous sets and beautifully shot on and around the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It is a pleasure to watch.

The film is transferred in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1, pillarboxed into a 16x9 anamorphic widescreen. There is slight cropping of the upper and lower edges with some loss of visual information in those areas but this is minimal and quite unnoticeable. It has been beautifully restored and remastered. The print is free of dirt or defects. Colors are rich, vibrant and quite sumptuous. The picture is sharp with minimal grain. Black levels are deep and rich. All in all, a beautiful transfer. Sound is in the original Italian 2.0 Stereo but with surprisingly good bass extension, heard mostly in the music. Optional English subtitles are included. Like ""Swept Away,"" there are no extras save for a few trailers for other Koch-Lorber releases.",1148342400,15,2920,4.910931174089069
8111396,1,B000EMGF1M,"I did not like the movie a little too degrading for women and men, however my review of the Seller should have been excellent as I mistook him for another seller and gave him a bad review, but he did deliver on time and make sure there was no problem.",1028678400,,251,4.04
