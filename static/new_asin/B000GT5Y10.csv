8134380,5,B000GT5Y10,"An extraordinary movie made by an extraordinary actor of Indian Cinema... Kamal Hassan. The scenes, dialogues and the emotions exactly reflect the rustic and pristine traditional situation of rural India. How factions form and how people align themselves and quarrel over agricultural land, water and how some manipulate human nature is very subtly portrayed. I think Hollywood would be proud of this masterpiece.",1177977600,,413,5.571428571428571
