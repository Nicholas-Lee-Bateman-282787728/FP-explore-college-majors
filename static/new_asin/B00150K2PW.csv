8256876,4,B00150K2PW,"This could be a three or a four. It was I believe a made for TV movie from the BBC. Overall, it's a nice little film to entertain you on a slow night or afternoon. It's also a chance to see Tom Baker trying to play a character other than Dr. Who. He doesn't quite pull it off, even with the heavy makeup. Then there's Perry Mason, played by Raymond Burr, operating incognito as an Egyptian without Della and Paul in tow. In other words, Raymond Burr didn't quite pull of playing a character other than Perry Mason. He made the same facial expressions, the same sighs and long dramatic pauses, and I kept waiting for him to turn and ask someone, ""Isn't true that on the night in question..."" There are a lot of other fine old actors in this who do a superb job. However, if you're into King Tut and Egyptology, you may be horrified at the creative license taken by the film, but if you can get pass that and enjoy the romantic notion of Egypt during this time period, you will enjoy it.",1457740800,,985,4.24468085106383
