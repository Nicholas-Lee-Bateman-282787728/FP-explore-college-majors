7898028,5,6305884285,"If you're a fan of Sammo Hung's films, you've GOT to have an appreciation for bad film.  That's ""good"" bad film.  The kind that's so bad that it's good.  Many of his films are of that kind of experience that only Sammo can bring.  Sappy dialogue, strange plots, and depending on the film, stuff that could never take off commercially in America.  It's often an alien experience watching a Sammo Hung film.  I'll tell you as long as I have a restored version of his films, with english dialogue dubbed in, I'm a happy camper.

At first when I saw Filthy Guy (which ought to be called ""Dirty Fool"".  No one in the film EVER says ""Filthy Guy""), I thought I was in for a real stinker.  Right from the get go, it's not brought over in a restored fashion, it's definitely not in widescreen, and the english dubbed voices are beyond terrible.  They're downright embarrassing.  And then I realized:  THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SO FUN TO WATCH!

Fans of badly dubbed kung-fu films need look no further for a more ridiculous and loony film than this.  The dialogue is so ridiculous in this picture, that I have watched it nearly 50 times already and there are still parts of the film where I can't figure out what in the world they're talking about.

Believe me, don't believe any bad reviews on this film.  This film is a dream come true for sappy kung-fu movie fans.  The sappiest, the corniest, the dopiest Sammo film ever made.  And that's not said lightly.

Watch the movie first then read the synopsis. I liked this movie, it's pretty funny which makes up for its low budget. The local landowner tries to kill Filthy Guy because they believe a prophecy saying he will be the next emperor. The land owner wants the emperorship for himself so he must kill his own servant Filthy Guy who is about a durable as Curly from the Three Stooges. In the end the action come up as he frees a political prisoner, becomes famous, rebels join him and two hot babes fight along side him. If you like Sammo's comedy then this is one to get.",1041897600,2,707,4.2444444444444445
