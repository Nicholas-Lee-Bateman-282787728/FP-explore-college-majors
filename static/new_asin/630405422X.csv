794053,3,630405422X,"If you're looking for action, this one's got it all. Lauren Bacall plays a doctor's wife who is devoted to saving a crown prince in India from Muslim factions who wish to destroy the last semblance of the prince's father's rule. With a hardy band of British and Indian players, they set out on a dangerous mission by  train that includes ambushes, scenes of carnage and a dastardly plot to kill the crown prince in a breathtaking bridge scene that's not to be missed. Ms. Bacall is radiant, and plays this one with a quiet dignity well-suited to her strong lady's role. Wilfrid Hyde-White is a delight and Kenneth More's Capt. Scott is an A-1 action hero, with foibles and faults, but in the end a very stiff British upper lip. Herbert Lom is simply the devil incarnate, and you'll see why. As I said before, this is a Saturday-morning serial with a sophisticated worldview (geopolitical discussions are not just the backdrop, but the point) and enough well-paced action to more than satisfy.",1071532800,16,992,4.734104046242774

She is never really good in anything after Bogart,and here she is not terribly good, always the same droning voice, and a remarkable loss of looks after the 40's. The action is the star here, and it is excellent. Kenneth Moore is best.
This used to be called Northwest Frontier and other things. I think Voyage to India as well. Twentieth Century Fox did not believe in this film at all, and it was the next to last of a three pic deal Bacall had with Fox. The others were The Gift Of Love and Shock Treatment.

794056,4,630405422X,"As a Lauren Bacall fan, I found ""Flame Over India"" immensely enjoyable. A reviewer once called it one of her best performances and I agree. As Catherine Wyatt, widow of a doctor and governess of a young prince in early-twentieth-century India, Bacall crackles and pops, assisted by a sturdy cast including British actor Kenneth More as Army Captain Scott, the man charged with bringing the young prince to safety in the midst of religious warfare.

There is  also a very credible attraction that develops between the Bacall and More  characters.  Bacall's character is quite outspoken (the kind of character  she did a lot when she got older), while More is amused by her and  attracted to her.

794258,4,630405422X,"North West Frontier, 1959 film

This movie takes place in British Colonial India in the early 20th century. There is a revolt against the British and their colonial allies. Their fort is attacked by the rebels, there is no hope unless they can get reinforcements. The local heir to the throne, a young prince, is safe in this fort. But it is very important to save his life since he commands the loyalty of millions. There is an old switching engine that can carry one coach, so this will be used to carry the prince and a few passengers to safety. This steam locomotive can break through the barricade and carry the passengers out of the surrounded and doomed fort. When they later arrive at a train station they find the passengers in an earlier train were all slaughtered. At the next station they are able to fill the water tank. We get a hint about a problem passenger.

There is drama when they stop to replace a missing rail and come under rifle fire. A heliograph can send a message over many miles. Peters, the arms salesman, knows little about using his product. [Believable?] Van Leyden, the Dutch journalist, is under suspicion because of his personal beliefs (sympathy for the rebels?). The princes governess is an American widow; she rescued a baby from the massacred train. An elderly civil servant, and a lady, round out the passengers. A military officer, Captain Scott, and a few Indian soldiers provide protection. The locomotive engineer is the real hero, he keeps the old engine running. The last crisis comes when they must cross a high bridge that has been damaged. Their light train must proceed slowly and carefully, and does so. Are they safe now? Another heliograph blinks its message on the horizon.

Van Leyden is kept under guard. What can happen when they pass into a tunnel? Will there be a threat to the passengers? Will Van Leyden try to kill the young prince? Can he succeed, or will there be a happy ending? There is drama from the suspense in wanting to see what happens. We learn the American governess knows how to use a rifle. There are threats from horsemen, but the train outruns them to arrive safely in Cawnpore. They hear good news about the relief of Haserabad. What does the young prince plan to do in the future? (An ironic ending to this story.)

This movie has a wide range of characters and actors whose national backgrounds should appeal to American, British, and Indian audiences. Its a good movie with a message about divided loyalties. Is it ever right to kill one person to possibly save thousands? The Northwest Frontier is near Pakistan; Afghanistan is next door. This movie was also named Flame Over India.",1462060800,,2665,4.688034188034188

I find the dynamics of a small group of disparate refugees traveling an old train, thru dangerous county, being chased by thronging enemies REALLY interesting.  There's an American nanny, a small Hindi child (heir of a Maharaja), a Colonial British soldier, an angry Dutch/Indonesian Muslim newspaperman, a proud dyed-in the wool Bristish matron (wife of a Consul), a humble Hindi train engineer, and a cavalier French arms dealer.

794427,4,630405422X,"J. Lee Thompson's adventure (retitled FLAME OVER INDIA) is a dramatic tale of an hazardous train journey to take Indian Prince Kishan (Govind Raja Ross) out of the clutch of Muslim rebels and into safety.  The passengers comprise a diverse group - the brave soldier Captain Scott (Kenneth More), the feisty doctor's wife (Lauren Bacall), the impassive governor's spouse (Ursula Jeans), a British bureaucrat (Wilfrid Hyde White), an arms-dealer (Eugene Deckers) and a Dutch journalist (Herbert Lom) who turns out to be a saboteur in disguise.

Thrillingly photographed by Geoffrey Unsworth in India, NORTH-WEST PASSAGE contains some spectacular sequences as the beaten-up old train plows across the Indian landscape under Gupta's (I. S. Johar's) control.  Frequently attacked by Muslim rebels, who are seen galloping towards the train on horseback, the passengers manage to repel them with a combination of luck and sheer courage.  The film does contain its fair share of stereotypes: Hyde-White's Bridie is suave yet naive; Jeans does a fair job of sustaining her stiff upper lip in the face of adversity; while Bacall shows a commendable disdain for British authority (as an American, she is accustomed to having her own way).

Yet the film is a fascinating product of its time, as it tries to transmit a liberal message at a time when the British Empire was in the process of breaking up.  More's Captain Scott is both brave yet fair (it is no coincidence that his name should recall that of the intrepid polar explorer, immortalized in SCOTT OF THE ANTARCTIC (1948)), and tries his best to look after the Prince.  While Lom's Van Leyden possesses violent instincts, he continually castigates the British for their desire to divide and rule: what is evident from the Governor's wife's behavior, both towards the Prince and to a little Indian baby they find on the way, is that she is not interested in power, but rather trying to help people in distress.  Likewise Bacall makes every effort to look after the Prince, as well as helping Scott out when all seems lost.  Whereas the British are still in power - the action takes place in 1905, some forty-three years before India gained independence - they are more than willing to share it, and thereby ensure that everyone is entitled to equal treatment under the law.  Such policies were also pursued at the end of the Fifties (when the film was released) as the British oversaw a series of peaceful transitions to independent government in both Africa and Asia.",1409443200,,2514,4.978520286396181

It is the North West Frontier of India at the turn of the century. Captain Scott [Kenneth More CBE] is sent by the British Governor to rescue a five-year-old Prince and his American Governess, Catherine Wyatt [Lauren Bacall], when a rebellion breaks out amongst the tribesmen. Captain Scott is instructed to take the child to safety in Kalapur, which is 300 miles away, on the pretext that while he is alive, no rebellion can succeed. They are forced to travel on an old and fragile train, but it soon becomes clear that the danger from the train is the least of their worries. Someone on the train is trying to kill the Prince.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: If you are a great fan and enjoy adventure and mysterious intrigue, well you might find VCI Entertainment's new Blu-ray of Flame Over India [aka: North West Frontier]  is a brilliant and amazing pleasant surprise. It's a large-scale colonial epic filmed on location that features warring rebel cavalry, an imperial English outpost and a desperate race to escape on a rickety, unreliable train. Although the English star Kenneth More has first billing, the always-interesting Lauren Bacall draws our attention in an atypical action-adventure film.

Although the quality of his output soon went downhill, English director J. Lee Thompson made consistently good dramas and small-scale thrillers in the 1950s. He turned heads with his sweat-soaked desert war tale with the film Ice Cold In Alex and struck pay dirt with the excellent Tiger Bay, a suspense film starring tiny tot Hayley Mills in her first role. That led to this large-scale epic in awesome CinemaScope and Color by Deluxe.

Flame Over India (original title North West Frontier) has a lot in common with John Ford's Stagecoach in that it's essentially about a motley mix of Anglos confined in a train car, racing across an Indian plain trying to evade ""bloodthirsty savages."" It may be a blatant reworking of Stagecoach as the original story was co-written by Patrick Ford and Maureen O'Hara's husband Will Price. The final screenplay was adapted from a script by screenwriter Frank S. Nugent, the writer of eleven John Ford films.

The action takes place in 1905, when Indian independence was a dream of the future. While the Muslim rebels are gathering in the hills, preparing to storm the Maharaja's palace and kill his son, a six-year-old Hindu prince who will be the future leader of the country. The Maharaja appeals to the British to take his son to safety in Delhi. Intrepid Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott [Kenneth More] rescues a child prince just before a horde of rebels overruns his father's palace, killing everyone. Scott takes the child to the besieged fort city of Hasarabad, but misses the last train out. The young prince must be saved to defeat the rebellion and the locals are loyal to his bloodline. English administrator Sir John Wyndham [Ian Hunter] the Governor and doesn't know what to do, as armed relief cannot reach the fort anytime soon.

Seeing this disaster as an opportunity to make good and Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott enlists the aid of railroad employee Gupta [I.S. Johar] the driver, who is able to repair a tiny switchyard engine capable of pulling a single coach out of rebel territory. In a daring escape, the train rams its way through the fortress gates and gets away before the siege cavalry can stop it. Booked to ride are Gupta, Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott, the little prince, Sir John's wife Lady Windham [Ursula Jeans] the Governor's Wife, bureaucrat Mr. Bridie [Wilfrid  Hyde-White] and shifty arms dealer Mr. Peters [Eugene Deckers]. Dutch-Indian journalist Peter van Leyden [Herbert Lom] forces Lady Wyndham to allow him aboard at the last minute. Accompanying the prince is his governess Catherine Wyatt [Lauren Bacall], a feisty American with experience in India.

More trouble comes almost immediately. At the very first rail stop, Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott's travellers discover that rebels have ambushed the previous train and slaughtered every man, woman and child. Catherine Wyatt finds a living baby in the carnage, and brings it along. Tensions stay high as the tiny group learns that the rebels have sabotaged the rails in more than one place, especially the crisis occurs at a bridge crossing where part of the rail has been damaged. The passengers have to disembark and make their way by foot across part of the track which stretches perilously over a ravine. Scott and the prince almost fall when Van Leyden seems hesitant in passing the boy over to Scott. To the dismay of some of the other passengers, who believe he is over-reacting, and Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott accuses Peter van Leyden of deliberately trying to cause the death of the prince, and places him under armed guard in a separate carriage and one of the passengers is acting very suspicious as well, and may be trying to subvert the desperate flight to freedom!

Although filmed in 1958, the exciting and suspenseful Flame Over India could have been written in 1929, or even 1860 for that matter. It takes the attitude that India's childlike primitives would slaughter one another indiscriminately were it not for the benign guardianship of their selfless, noble English administrators. We all love or at least enjoy wonderful colonial stories like The Four Feathers and Gunga Din. Flame Over India comes along too late to get away with its reactionary tone and the filmmakers clearly think that India and Pakistan should be begging their English masters to return. Of all the English films in denial over the End of the British Empire, this may be the most stubborn.

The passengers may be strict stereotypes, but they are acted with spirit and style. The stately Lady Wyndham expresses contempt for the ungrateful savages, who do not appreciate the many years of hard work put into India by dedicated men like her husband. Gupta talks to his engine in Pidgin English, like a latter-day Gunga Din. Catherine Wyatt puts forward an assertive personality (and how could Ms. Lauren Bacall not do so?) but spends a lot of time serving tea. The cheerful Mr. Bridie chirps happy thoughts, but still betrays the opinion that Peter van Layden, a ""half-breed Muslim"" is by definition socially unacceptable. Capt. William Charles Willoughby Scott thinks that Peter van Layden's parentage is reason enough to distrust him. And everybody has harsh words for Peter van Layden's self-important arms merchant. The film simplifies the local rebellion as simple terrorism.

Peter van Leyden [Herbert Lom] is a real nasty piece of work, a sneaky, resentful zealot who takes advantage of the accommodating English for his own malign purposes. He reveals his religion by balking at picking up a pigskin box, and gives away his villainy with a constant stream of menacing anti-British remarks. And sure enough Van Leyden turns out to be not only lazy and selfish, but a kill-crazy demon as well. The insensitive screenplay believes every bit of this racism is fine and dandy. It's as if the writers read Rudyard Kipling but ignored his sympathies for the Hindu and Muslim underdogs.

The film portrays the rebels as faceless delinquents with no cause except anarchy. The Muslim horsemen trying to stop the train behave like ""stupid"" Indians in American westerns, breaking only one rail and weakening just one bridge. They harass the train with rifle fire, but press a real attack only once. They're easily deterred as soon as noble Brits put up the slightest resistance.

J. Lee Thompson's direction does a brilliant job, and finds many dramatic angles as the train moves through hostile territory or stands exposed to enemy fire while Captain Scott and company try to repair a rail. The crowd and action scenes are acceptable and certainly expensive-looking. We can't tell if the giant palaces we see are miniatures or not, as they look real. The pacing is frequently uneven, as people often stand around talking when quick action is needed. The train pauses at the massacre site much longer than it ought to. Kenneth More and Lauran Bacall play a long scene amid a welter of corpses, surely knowing that the unseen killers could return at any moment.

Kenneth More was one of England's most popular actors at the time. I find him essentially charmless in this particular outing. Lauren Bacall plays her role straight, as if doing an Indian version of her previous Blood Alley. Among this cast, she may have had the most experience with distant locations, having braved equatorial jungles while on location for The African Queen. A specialist in surly, menacing ethnics, Herbert Lom walks away with the show. He received few starring roles like in Phantom of the Opera [1962] but was always in demand, and especially in the hilarious riotous Pink Panther films.

In terms of a simple story effectively told, Flame Over India makes the grade. Turn off your political brain and it will be a surprise treat, a large-scale vintage adventure thriller that slipped under the radar.

To my recollection it is the first CinemasCope feature released by VCI Entertainment on Blu-ray, and the results, if not as spectacular as might have been hoped, are at least it is very solid. VCI Entertainment has had a tendency with some of their Blu-ray releases to smear on the digital noise reduction with a fairly aggressive hand, though for the most part their The Rank Collection releases have been spared that approach, something which continues here. Not only is grain visible, in a couple of shots it gets perilously close to noise levels, especially in some shots of the sky. The image is decently crisp and clear and fine object detail is quite pleasing in close-ups. In terms of the colour timing, things are a bit yellow throughout several swaths of this presentation, giving flesh tones a jaundiced look and bathing a lot of the image in a sort of saffron hue. Because of this tendency, reds drift toward orange and blues have a slightly green tinge. This anomaly is worst in the film's opening 30 minutes or so, and while it improves markedly after that point, it's prevalent off and on throughout to one degree or another. A good telecine colourist could have at least ameliorated this had they colour timed this release against a reference print, but perhaps there wasn't one available to them. The elements are in quite good condition, with only occasional scratches and a stray line or two (usually in the middle of the frame) remaining after what is advertised as a ""restoration.""

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Flame Over India features two uncompressed LPCM audio tracks (despite VCI's continued insistence on their Blu-ray releases that they have ""Dolby"" tracks), one the film's original mono track delivered via 2.0 LPCM Mono track and a so-called ""enhanced"" track delivered via the 4.0 LPCM track [aka Enhanced 4 Channel]. Stick with the 2.0 track for a number of reasons. It offers excellent fidelity with really nice dynamic range, and well prioritized dialogue, effects and score. While the 4.0 track does significantly open up the sound field, especially in some of the action sequences, it also has a number of truly bizarre anomalies, including really bad phasing and chorusing, and at circa 1:55:00 or so, a completely weird looping echo of a baby crying that makes the poor tot sound like the spawn of Satan.

Finally, whatever you call it, Flame Over India [aka North West Frontier] is a very thrilling adventure yarn, full of some fantastic scenery and local colour. Lauran Bacall and Kenneth More make for a very appealing lead duo, and the supporting cast is full of familiar faces, all of whom do fine work. This was a sumptuous CinemaScope production and helped elevate J. Lee Thompson to the A-list rank (no pun intended, considering this film's studio) of directors. The Blu-ray video is decently sharp and well detailed; the colour timing is really peculiarly yellow in the opening half hour especially. The ""enhanced"" LPMC 4.0 audio also has some significant problems, though at least the 2.0 LPCM mix sounds fine. For those who can overlook these niggling issues, Flame Over India offers a great story and some very exciting set pieces, and with caveats noted, but sadly there was no Extras, which is a shame, as I am sure somewhere in the Rank Organisation vaults there is some brilliant outtakes and interviews with the main actors. Despite this, I have always loved this film ever since I first viewed it on British Television, usually shown on a Sunday afternoon and when VCI Entertainment announced its final release, I of course had to Order it instantly and of course it is a great honour to now have this classic British Rank Collection film included in my ever increasing VCI Entertainment Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

But the cast of Lauren Bacall and Herbert Lom are just not believeable in their roles here and the movie just moves way to SLOW by modern standards.

794743,5,630405422X,"Hang onto your pith helmet, grab your Enfiled rifle and scramble aboard the last train from a distant outpost of the waning British Empire as it hurtles into danger, thrills and high adventure.
This splendid movie has everything; great cast, fine script, three-dimensional characters, flawless directing, gorgeous photography & editing and a rousing score. Even the restored print is flawless.
A genuine widescreen epic from 1959, originally titled NORTH WEST FRONTIER and retitled FLAME OVER INDIA for American release, this is the kind of superior adventure tale the British do so well, set in Northern India c. 1905 amid the bloody religious wars that resulted in the eventual breakaway of the Muslim state of Pakistan decades later.
From the first scene in a remote Indian palace high in the Hindu Kush, the story takes off quite literally with a bang and never lets up. Beautifully paced, building tension, suspense and enough daring-do to keep even the most jaded viewer riveted, the plot is spare, compelling and thoroughly believable: A motley ensemble of disparate characters are thrown together by fate onto a broken-down train in headlong flight from religious fanatics bent on killing them and their charge, a six year-old boy prince.
But it's much more than just a generic actioner. The characters are complex, well-drawn and realistic, including a brave but charmingly unassuming British Army officer (Kenneth More), a feisty, outspoken but empathetic American governess, (Lauren Bacall), a despicably cynical arms dealer selling guns to both sides (appalled at the idea of being imminently dispatched by his own merchandise), a mad, articulate but very human and plausible villain, and the endearingly humble but courageous Indian train engineer who saves everyone's bacon more than once.
The historical details are fed to us with generous portions of well-timed action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, hairs-breadth escapes and just enough humor to keep it all from becoming ponderous or heavy-handed.
Politics aside, this is a wonderful example of the expertly crafted filmmaking of the 1950's, minus the Spielberg action clichs of later years, and no phony-looking CGI green-screen computer FX in sight. The spectacular stunts and locations are all the more exciting because they're essentially real.
Not quite David Lean, this film is nevertheless a fascinating character study of the various dramatis personae involved in the Indian civil war, British, Hindu and Muslim, briefly sketching the nature of the antipathy between Muslim and Hindu still causing enmity between India and Pakistan today. That it never quite rises above its high adventure themes into true greatness is hardly a complaint, given the excellent quality of the storytelling and production values. In other words, you won't mind a bit that it isn't LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.
This is the kind of movie they're talking about when they say, ""The dan't make 'em like that any more!""",1337472000,2,2959,5.338329764453961

The famous theme  used in the film  is unforgettable. A pity they  did not use the words of the song as well. Probably because it was a boating song.(jolly boating weather etc)Somehow it fits  beautifully into this  adventure on a train in India.

The real stars though are the engine and its driver, Gupta, played by I.S. Johar. His picturesque (not quite perfect) English is both funny and genuine, in the scheme of things. The American governess professes to speak her mind because that's what she has a mind for! The wife of the governor, in response to jibes about the British Empire, states in one beautiful delivery;""half the world is civilised only because we have made it so!""; a sublime riposte.

The movie is fun and reminds me of the British films I used to watch in Alaska when I was a kid (for some reason we always got English movies set in the jungle or the desert). The players in North West Frontier did an excellent job (led by Bacall), and this was as true for the leads as it was for the supporting cast. As far as the writing was concerned, there was quite a bit of plot twists and other devices (including a potential traitor!) and it made for great entertainment.

As a fan of classic war & historical films, I can say that the film exceeded my expectations. The story is set in 1905. It involves an English captain (Kenneth More) who has to take a 5 year old Hindu prince to safety and away from the Muslim rebels who have killed the prince's father. More's only means of travel is a old locomotive through hostile territory. This movie is filled with great action sequences, capably helmed by director J. Lee Thompson (who also directed The Guns Of Navarone). What's great about films like this is that they were filmed on real locations, using actual props (such as a real train) and they have a texture and realism about them that modern films cannot match. There is no CGI, no dumb teenagers, and no smart-aleck one-liners in this film. This DVD is presented in anomorphic 2:35 widescreen and the print looks stunning for a fifty-year old film. Also stunning is Lauren Bacall, who plays the governess of the young prince. Her character was obviously added to the film to give it a romantic angle, but Bacall brings her typical independent attitude to the role to make it more than just a token female. Also deserving kudos is I. S Johar, who plays the Indian train engineer. Some veiwers may see the role as a stereotype, but Johar steals the film.
Anyone interested in old-fashioned adventure and in films ""that they just don't make anymore"", should check out this underrated and well-made picture.",1243641600,7,1566,4.677536231884058

794815,4,630405422X,"This British film, released in England under the name ""Northwest Frontier"",  takes place in India in 1905,  during the time of the British Raj. As usual, there is some insurrection taking place in the Northwest frontier, and a Captain Scott (Kenneth Moore) is charged with taking a young Indian crown prince, along with Catherine Wyatt (Lauren Bacall), his American  governess, to safety. The prince is a Hindu, and it seems that some Muslim rebels wish to kill him.

Captain Scott, who keeps a stiff upper lip at all times, commissions an old wreck of a train with an illustrious name, The Empress of India,  to get him and his charges to safety. They board this train with several others, both British and Indian, one of whom harbors a traitorous secret. As the train chugs along several hundred miles towards safety, this hardy band is beset by insurrectionist ambushes, train trouble, and the machinations of the traitor amongst them.

Kenneth Moore is full of British derring-do as the beleaguered Captain who is nearly undone by the enemy within. Lauren Bacall, as a governess,  seems a little like a fish out of water, but manages to hang onto her role. I. S. Johar is delightful in the role of Gupta, the loyal native train conductor who comically struggles with his English. Wilfrid Hyde-White is endearing in the role of Bridie, the quintessential British civil servant.  Ursula Jeans is charming as the stalwart and resolute Lady Windham. Herbert Lom is appropriately sinister as the half-Dutch, half-Indian journalist, who has very decided views on British colonialism, as well as a secret agenda.

This is a gripping, action packed, old-fashioned adventure film that should appeal to all those who enjoy Anglo-Indian themes, as well as those who  enjoy a well-written and well-acted film.",1105920000,4,1801,5.0134228187919465

Scott keeping  safe the young Prince Kisha and his guardian Mrs Wyatt an American Widow. The problem is that the place is not longer safe and our hero must leave the fort  with a strange group in an old train machine: The Empress of India. And with a traitor among them

The story is not really very original, but has moments that show the craftsman J. Lee Thompson was, like the constant threatening of the rebels who are following the train  from the mountains, to the conflict  that India was living under the British control.

Kenneth More is absolutely brilliant as our sensible captain Scott. He knows his duty and always try to do his best but he is alone in the group. Lauren Bacall is a bitter woman after a marriage who was not what she expected but as long as the journey goes she is going to be more human not so introvertive. But the great  characters of this films are Wilfrid Hyde White ( the unforgetable Col. Pickering of My Fair Lady)who plays Birdie, the typical Civil servant who carries with him Britain. And Herbert Lom, playing a half Dutch journalist who is very critic with the British colonialism.

The film is really ejoyable, and although not a masterwork, it is better than many we must suffer today.",1105401600,4,1631,4.517006802721088
794817,5,630405422X,"Kenneth Moore is a British army officer charged with taking a young Hindu prince to safety when his life is threatened by Moslem rebels. With him is Lauren Bacall as the prince's American governess. They are obliged to make use of an ancient, rusty steam engine to carry them on a perilous journey through hostile territory. Moore and Bacall are both excellent in their roles, and there are fine performances too from Wilfrid Hyde White as a dithery bachelor, Ursula Jeans as a courageous Memsahib, Eugene Deckers as a sauve arms dealer, and Herbert Lom as a Eurasian journalist with a chip on his shoulder. The best performance in the film though is by I.S. Johar as Gupta, the engine driver devoted to his old engine Victoria. Their journey is almost unbearably exciting, with one peril after another to overcome. The best line comes at the end, when I.S. Johar is being carried off wounded and says triumphanty to Moore ""they said Victoria was finished, no good except but for shunting, let them speak now. She showed them!""",1091404800,8,1027,4.775280898876405

7863048,5,630405422X,"Wow, what a film! I was not expecting to like this movie so much. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it even better than the acclaimed A Passage to India. I was hooked from the very beginning as the king worriedly hands his son, the prince over to Kenneth More. The story has been described by othersa British captain (More) and a handful of others are attempting to escort a 6 year old Hindu prince to safety some 300 miles away all the while being stalked by a roving army of Muslim fanatics intent on killing the prince. They even massacre a trainload of innocent Hindu refugees in the process. There is a gripping tension that hangs over the whole film as their little train carrying the prince winds its way throughout the Indian countryside.

 Excellent cinematography and likable characters (except for one) are just some of the positives. I especially liked Gupta, the railway man. He and his broken English provide some comic relief in the midst of the ominous situation. It will be ready in a soon moment, sahib! And for a film made in 1959, the special effects were very realistic. The scene where they are high up on the rail bridge looked more real than most modern cartoon CGI junk. No profanity or nudity and no needless gore. There are subtitles for the hard of hearing.  I usually rate a movie by my willingness to want to watch it again. Well, with this one, I knew I'd want to watch it again before it was even over! What a good little movie as Lauren Bacall once referred to it.",1511308800,,1503,4.478102189781022

It's fairly honest, too, in portraying the criticism of the Empire, except that the critic ""turns out"" to be a real villain. A rousing story with viewpoints now forgotten.",1507593600,,310,4.553571428571429

I am familiar with the movie - the story/ writing /acting/production values of this movie are top notch and I have seen it in a fairly good DVD presentation in the past - but this Blu Ray version was shockingly bad!  The Best way I can describe it's picture quality is that I felt like I was watching a VHS tape on a VCR blown up on my 60"" HD TV! If that wasn't bad enough the film speed was not synchronized properly so you will receive an instant headache if you try to watch more than a minute of it! An Embarrassing rip off!
