3643814,5,B001HRYBN2,"I bought this set even though I already have cardio overdrive. This was my first firm DVD and I definitley one of my favorites. It has multiple cardio sections, two of which incorporate weights.
High def sculpt is nice for days you don't want to do cardio. It's a little slow moving in the beginning, but I really like that she incorporates stretching throughout the workout instead of having one long section at the end.
I didn't like hard core fusion very much when I first tried it, but it's growing on me. The toning sections are good and the cardio sections are super high intensity. Allie takes a bit of time explaining the moves so it's not hard to follow.
Cardio party is great when you just want to do some cardio. I like to use DVD if I want an extra long workout, so I do this one after completing a first. If you have a lot of firm DVDs you will probably recognize these exercises. For example, the section Alison leads is found in cardio overdrive. Allie's section incorporates a lot of dance moves; depending on your level of coordination you will probably love or hate this section. It's the last section so I usually just skip it.",1305244800,7,1146,4.436018957345971

All of the workouts are great.  This is what originally started my The Firm collection.",1444953600,,260,4.48936170212766

as well. What happened!",1400371200,,138,4.148148148148148
8309436,4,B001HRYBN2,"This seems to be a good workout and it keeps you moving.  As the instructor explains the steps, her and her workout group are going into the set and the same time.  I kinda like the fact that I don't have to stand still or grab the remote to fast forward through in order to keep my heart rate up.  I like the Firm series!",1376006400,,322,3.923076923076923
8309437,3,B001HRYBN2,"And definitely do your own stretching before and after... they are inadequate and too jerky (you can't stretch muscles while bouncing at high speed!)  I've pulled a muscle in my hip repeatedly with these dvd's.  Having said that, with my own warm-up, the two DVDs I do enjoy are Hi def sculpt and Cardio party.  The other two, Hard core fusion and Cardio overdrive are unnecessarily complicated and having done them each numerous times I still can't keep up with the moves because they change and combine too quickly.  I alternate the two I like from this set with other Firm tapes, including 60-minute routines, the 20-minute Stephanie Huckabee routines and yoga depending on the time available.  Bottom line, these are not bad but there are better choices out there.",1345939200,,768,4.876923076923077
