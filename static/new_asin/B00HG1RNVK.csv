8632599,5,B00HG1RNVK,"The video of this is on YouTube! In the search box type or copy and paste: ""The Secret Vatican @ Alien Connection""Tom Horn. Also, Thomas Horn and Cris Putnam put a lot of work into their books Exo-Vaticana and Petrus Romanus: The Final Pope Is Here. Both books are outstanding.",1392163200,,277,4.56
8632600,1,B00HG1RNVK,"This is Tom Horn on steroids. One of the most discombobulating presentations I've ever seen. His delivery was uncomfortable to watch. No need to purchase this. You can see it free on Youtube (search: The Secret Vatican @ Alien Connection) and there is nothing in this video that you can't hear him say on Prophecy in the News or in any of the various and abundant radio show and podcast interviews he's done that are available for free online.

I am not Catholic but the steady stream of Catholic jokes were in extremely poor taste. Not my idea of entertainment.
In previous venues and in his books he's quick to explain he is not a Catholic basher and I don't believe he is but in this video he goes so overboard I could certainly see how a Catholic viewer would be offended. Horn did a disservice to fellow evangelicals here.

Nothing, to me, justifies paying for this DVD. I came away from this wondering, for the life of me, why his behavior was so obnoxious. Again, uncomfortable to watch. Same regurgitated info he's already put out there while making the rounds to promote his books.",1389571200,3,1090,4.584615384615384
