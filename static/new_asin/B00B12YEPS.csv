8560475,5,B00B12YEPS,"This Just Planes DVD may be unique. Capt. Coupez of Brussels Airlines takes the A330 into two West African nation's airports; Banjul, The Gambie and Conarkry, Guinea, both of which have no operating navigation aids. Only radio contact with the airport's control towers is available. All operation is by visual flight rules. And Capt. Coupez notes that when landing at these airports the pilot must also be alert to animals that may be on the runway and birds in the area as both airports are in coastal areas. It seems rather incredible that modern jet aircraft would attempt such an operation, but, maybe the technology of such aircraft is just what makes this possible. Anyway it is thrilling to watch! The flights operating to Eskisehir, Turkey and Geneva, Switzerland are tame by comparison. Though in Turkey the landing and takeoff are on a narrow taxiway as the runway is undergoing rehabilitation. This is a fascinating video!",1478476800,,933,4.987179487179487
