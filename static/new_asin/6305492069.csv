1036320,4,6305492069,"Just a quick note: I don't think some of the reviewers have paid attention.  There are criticisms to Jackie Chan as director. Well, two notes: 1) He did not directed this movie  2) Most of the best Jackie Chan movies have been directed by him. He has been recognized as an excellent director.
Anyway, this movie was done for the construction of some association for directors from Hong Kong, and that explains why the multiple directors. Jackie Chan has said he is not satisfied with the final result of the movie.
But don't be scared.  This is an excellent comedy, using the old joke about mixed identities.  It is not heavy on the action side, but includes some nice fight scenes, including a final shutdown at a facility for testing cars.
If you are looking for one Chan movie, there are better ones to select for starters (Supercop, Operation Condor, Rumble in the Bronx).  But if you are a die hard fan, you will want to take a look at ""Twin Dragons"".",973209600,8,956,4.534883720930233

1036322,5,6305492069,"This is one of my favorite Chan movies. The whole film is played for laughs using the classic plot line of twins separated at birth who are reunited by accident as adults. The twins mix identities in many scenes  leading to fish-out-of-water humor. I particularly enjoyed the scene in  which the street-tough twin, Boomer, conducts an orchestra as a stand-in  for the famed-musician twin, John Ma. Through his tremendous energy (and  acrobatics), Boomer inspires a tepid orchestra to musical heights it has  never known before. Another really funny scene is the battle in the  Mitsubishi testing factory at the climax. Here, the theme of the  twins-acting-as-one, which has brought laughs throughout the film, reaches  its manic peak as Boomer helps martial-arts-impaired John Ma take down the  villain. Both of these scenes, especially the one in the factory, are so  hilarious, my kids and I were slapping each other on the back and howling  with laughter.
For those who love Jackie's stunts, there are some  amazing ones in this movie. One in particular blew me away: when he leaps  through the window of a car feet first.
I also like very much that in  Twin Dragons the women aren't just objects to be rescued from the villain,  as happens with such annoying predictability in most action films. Instead,  in this movie, something I've never seen before in quite this way, the  rescue-object is Boomer's ridiculous male best-friend, a scrawny fool who's  always in trouble, because he's addicted to baiting bad guys. Because  Boomer's pal is such a manipulative little jerk, the audience can freely  enjoy it when he frequently gets his comeuppance in the form of  dumped-on-the-rear slapstick.",952560000,8,1698,5.0577617328519855

1036324,1,6305492069,"Probably the worst Jackie Chan movie ever, it has very few fighting scenes, and only one or two even remotely Chan-like stunts. The technology to put them both on screen at the same time is awful as Chan passes through  himself several times. Plus, the supporting cast is terrible, especially  blue-collar Chan's sidekick.

1036325,2,6305492069,"This is one of the most boring and stupid movies, in which I have seen Jackie Chan as actor. Normally I like his movies, but this one was just only boring.

1036326,4,6305492069,"To review a Jackie Chan film is to admit that one has too much time on one's hands.  A more futile gesture is hard to imagine: I doubt anyone has ever decided whether or not to see a Chan movie based on anything so  trivial as a review or critique, and with good reason: Chan's track record  speaks for itself.  Over the past three decades, he's churned out dozens of  martial arts extravaganzas which have delighted audiences all over the  world, making him one of Asia's biggest (and richest) stars.  Chan fans, a  group I count myself part of, go to see his films not because of their  breathtaking intellect, but because we enjoy seeing the Master kick a  little ass, and make us laugh while he does so.  Who cares what the critics  think?
  Chan is a rare breed: a hybrid who possesses not only stunning  physical grace but also a sly streak of self-depreciating humor-- he's not  one of those buff Ah-nold clones, and that's part of his appeal: he looks  like ""everyman,"" and his characters use their wits (and a dash of  good ol' dumb luck) to pull themselves out of the dire situations they  continuously find themselves in.  In that regard, his performances parallel  the great silent comedians of cinema's earliest days: both Chaplin and  Buster Keaton are acknowledged by Chan as major influences.
  The plot  of ""Twin Dragons,"" made in 1992 but just released in America,  consists of the usual silliness: some bad guys are running around Hong  Kong, and only some tightly-edited kung-fu and astonishing stunt work by  Chan can make the streets safe again.  The twist this time is that Jackie  plays two roles, a pair of identical twin brothers separated at birth.  One  grows  up to be a master martial artist named Boomer, a tough guy raised in  the hard streets of Hong Kong.  His twin, John Ma, is a revered classical  pianist and conductor, educated in the finest schools and possessing no  martial arts ability.  Having no prior knowledge of each other's existence,  both men are soon mistaken for their twin, leading to some predictable but  amusing fish-out-of-water comedy (Boomer being forced to conduct a symphony  orchestra (one of Chan's all-time great comedic scenes), the wimpy Ma being  forced to duke it out with the bad guys, etc.)
  It's silly to even  consider commenting on the story itself; the dialogue and obligatory love  tangents (one of which features Maggie Cheung, Chan's co-star in  ""Supercop"") are here only to give the action sequences something  to alternate with.  Suffice it to say that this isn't  ""Casablanca,"" nor is it intended to be. It succeeds at what it  attempts to do: take the audience on a wild ride through some hilarious and  tense moments, with barely a moment to catch one's breath.  It's a winner  on two levels: this is not only the tightest Chan movie I've yet seen...  it's also the funniest.
  The only major disappointment with ""Twin  Dragons"" is the fact that there are no bloopers or outtakes attached  to the final reel.  (For those of you not in the know, Chan makes it a  policy to include a number of humorous outtakes intermixed with the end  credits of each of his movies, showing flubbed lines and stunts.)  It's a  long-standing tradition, and I'm perplexed as to why these were not  included with this American release of the film.  With such impressive  stunts, the outtakes are no doubt fascinating.",930268800,6,3380,4.743500866551127

1036392,3,6305492069,"This is probably the best Jackie Chan movie I have ever seen.

The story revolves around identical twins whose lives become inextricably intertwined when some confusion caused by a swapping of identity, in allusion to the literary classic ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" leads to the martial arts expert swapping identities with a composer devoid of any skills in wushu, lending to a series of highly comical situations, which packs the movie with laughs from start to end, although the fighting scenes leave something to be desired.

Nevertheless, this is why Jackie Chan is deservedly called the King of Kung Fu Comedy.",1351900800,,618,5.049019607843137
1036393,2,6305492069,"Jackie Chan's Twin Dragons is mildly entertaining but has mediocre fight scenes and humor that quickly becomes tiresome. The choreography is choppy and disorienting, rather like the overall flow of the movie. Much of the movie's humor hinges on people confusing the twin Jackie Chans for each other. It's not quite bad enough to be good, although there are some unexpectedly funny parts, such as when a man gets hit by a truck and bounces back and forth many times very quickly. But such moments are few and far between, and this is a movie best seen at most once.

1036448,3,6305492069,"THE TWIN DRAGONS (1992) was the first of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong films I ever saw. It was on a double bill with DRAGON INN (1992) at the old Sun Sing theater in New York's Chinatown, a cavernous space that closed some months later. I've been a fan of Jackie ever since and have sought out most of his Hong Kong films and even most of his American ones, as well as the Hong Kong films that got released in the U.S. in dubbed versions (with Jackie dubbing his own voice) from 1996 to 2000. TWIN DRAGONS was released to U.S. theaters in a cut, dubbed version in early 1999. This Fortune Star Legendary Collection release is the first high-quality edition I've ever had of the Hong Kong original and I'm quite happy about it. The subtitles have a few misspellings but the film otherwise looks and sounds great.

The film itself has a great farcical premise. Jackie plays twins separated at birth, one of whom grows up to be Yau Ma, a classical pianist/orchestra conductor raised in the west by his actual parents while the other is ""Die-Hard,"" a driver/mechanic raised on the Hong Kong streets who learned kung fu to defend himself. (He'd been snatched from the hospital as a newborn in a hostage situation gone bad and thrown down a hill where a street hooker found him and took him in, all seen in black-&-white in a pre-credits sequence.) When the world-famous pianist comes to Hong Kong, the paths of the twins cross for the first time. Each feels an inexplicable affinity for the other so that when one is subjected to great stress, so is the other, mere blocks or miles away, a phenomenon that baffles each of them. (This is all a take-off on ""The Corsican Brothers"" and it's a tactic used in the film when necessary for a laugh but forgotten the rest of the time.)

The best scenes are those in which the girlfriends each mistake the opposite brother for their boyfriend. Oddly, each girl winds up liking the mistaken brother better. Tong Sum (Nina Li Chi), the woman picked by a family friend to be Yau Ma's reluctant fianc, finds herself in bed with Die-Hard (she's expecting a massage, but gets a lot more) and is immediately smitten. Die-Hard's nightclub-singing girlfriend Barbara (Maggie Cheung) is impressed with Yau Ma's musical skills and sings a lovely song while Yau Ma plays the piano. Confusion reigns whenever the right brother shows up with no recall of what each of the girls has just experienced with them and when each brother is forced into a situation requiring the other brother (i.e., the street Jackie has to conduct an orchestra while musician Jackie is forced to drive a speeding car to help a crew of gangsters rescue their boss). There are a number of scenes like this and they're all quite funny and suspenseful. When the two brothers finally meet and confront each other, the joining of the two within the same frame struck me as flawless for the most part, although I'm sure I must have noticed matte lines when I saw it on the big screen. Regardless, the two Jackies both move around in the frame with each other as if they were actually twins. Interestingly, the point on the DVD time counter where the two Jackies face each other for the first time is...50:50! (Was this intentional or a happy accident?)

The only problem with all this is that the filmmakers felt obligated to load the film up with some trademark action and stunt sequences that tend to crowd out the farcical elements. These include a motorboat chase early in the film; a car-and-prison bus chase complete with a police shootout midway through the film; and a spectacular climactic confrontation between the two Jackies and a gang of thugs at a Hong Kong pier in which the action moves from the docks to a cargo ship to an auto-testing facility nearby. These are well-staged sequences and give Jackie ample opportunity to do his trademark kung fu and acrobatics, with an added comic angle of one of the Jackies being a non-fighter and having to cope in other ways. However, these sequences take us away from the two girlfriends for long stretches and they're never as funny as the hotel-set farcical scenes in which the two brothers slip in and out of scenes with their own girls and their opposite numbers. The film is enjoyable but the action scenes prevent it from being the great farce it could have been, along the lines of an earlier Jackie film, MIRACLES (1989, aka MR. CANTON AND LADY ROSE). Hence, three stars instead of four or five.

The film was made to benefit the Hong Kong Film Director's Guild and was directed by two of the major talents of the 1980s-90s Hong Kong New Wave, Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam. It is filled with cameo appearances by Hong Kong stars (David Chiang, Eric Tsang, Wang Lung Wei, Sylvia Chang, Philip Chan, etc.) and directors (Hark, Lam, John Woo, Wong Jing, Chor Yuen, Kirk Wong, etc.). The film's running time on this DVD is 99 minutes.",1266105600,,4878,4.6163594470046085
1036449,3,6305492069,"Neither bad dubbing nor shoddy split-screen special effects can sabotage the inspired  antics in ""Twin Dragons,"" a nimbly done action farce featuring martial arts sensation Jackie Chan as identical twin brothers separated at birth but reunited year later when evil Triad mobsters try to murder one of them.  Originally released as ""Shuang Long Hui"" in Hong Kong in 1992, ""Twin Dragons"" cost about $1.3 million, but this chopsocky slapstick earned megabucks at the Asian box office.  Along with acclaimed action co-directors Ringo Lam of ""Maximum Risk"" and Tsui Hark of ""Double Team"" and ""Knock Off"" at the helm, Chan starred in the movie to raise funds for the fledging Hong Kong Directors Guild.  Although seven years has elapsed since ""Shuang Long Hui"" opened, with VHS copies of it available under a number of titles, Dimension Films not only dusted off ""Twin Dragons"" but also has plastered it on screens across America.

Look-a-like brothers has been a favorite theme for novelists and filmmakers long before ""Twin Dragons"" appeared.  Mark Twain relied on same siblings as a staple plot device in his celebrated fiction.  Like the 1991 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller ""Double Impact,"" ""Twin Dragons"" casts Jackie Chan as heroic twins rather than as dramatic adversaries.  Anybody remember Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Man in the Iron Mask?"" ""Twin Dragons"" starts with a grim but vigorous black & white shoot-out at a hospital.  A wounded but dangerous felon escapes from a police escort.  Handcuffed to a cart, the villain swipes a detective's gun, shoots him as him, blows off the handcuffs and seizes one of the twin brothers.  Wielding the baby as a shield, the henchman shoots another cop and steals an ambulance.  An intrepid cop grabs the bumper and is dragged along the street until he puts a bullet in a rear tire.  As the vehicle lurches to a halt, the child is hurled into a public grove.  A drunken prostitute finds the child and raises him as her own son.

Meanwhile, the grief-stricken parents migrate to New York City with their surviving son.  Spared nothing by his indulgent parents, John Ma (Jackie Chan of ""Rush hour"") grows up to be a world famous concert pianist/conductor.  By comparison, scraping by on bits and pieces, the other twin--Boomer--develops incredible skills as a street fighter when he isn't fixing cars.  John Ma leaves the Big Apple to make his Hong Kong debut when the Asian gangsters mistake him for Boomer.  Boomer and hi troublesome buddy Tyson (Teddy Robin Kwan) owe the mob a hefty $300-thousand in HK funds, and they are out to collect when Ma shows up.

Scenarists Barry Wong, Tsui Hark, Cheung Tung Jo and Wong Yik have added a fillip a la Cheech & Chong's ""The Corsican Brothers"" to the twin brother hysterics by endowing them with a telekinetic link.  When John plays piano, Boomer watches while his fingers wriggle to a mysterious rhythm.  Only near the end of the action do the filmmakers exploit this psychic power for its full potential.  Separated from John by a fenced-in cage, Boomer acts out the kung-fu fight moves, and John inadvertently delivers those stunning blows to flatten his foes. Meanwhile, the scenarists have more fun with the familiar mistaken identities gag that dominates the first two-thirds of the film.  Fate and destiny play an immutable part in the proceedings.

In the tradition of Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors,"" Boomer and John Ma confuse themselves as well as their girlfriends. Inevitably, they wind up with the wrong girls, and the comic predicaments that emerge are entertaining.  The fights and the chases are fast-paced and hilariously staged, but then look at the helmers--Lam and Hark. The fight scene in the Mitsubishi testing facility is a triumphant of comedy and choreography.  If you can ignore the inferior dubbing and the obvious special effects, ""Twin Dragons"" is a rewarding riot of hilarity.  Hardcore Jackie Chan fans should be able to spot how Chan has modified many of the stunts over the years and used them for full effect in his ""Rush Hour"" movies.",1261008000,,4055,4.967407407407407
1036450,2,6305492069,"What do you get when you take two of the best action directors in Hong Kong near the peak of their powers - Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam - add two Jackie Chans and throw in his Police Story co-star Maggie Cheung?

1036453,2,6305492069,"Bad US dub aside (and they really should start releasing these films uncut and in their original language tracks), Twin Dragons has an interesting premise but rather shoddy execution. Through the use of various camera tricks and body-doubles, Jackie Chan plays a set of twins seperated at birth. One becomes a famous concert pianist, the other a streetwise mechanic. The trouble begins when the musical brother returns to Hong Kong for a concert, and the twins start sharing each others actions through a psychic link.

For my money, there wasn't enough of the twins interacting in the same frame, and too much of the typical 'mistaken identity' goofing associated with these stories. The effects used to make two Jackie Chans appear onscreen together are quite convincing, but the story resorts to the ""one twin ducks out while the other comes in"" device too often, sapping away the fun. The confusion with the two girlfriends is entertaining but ultimately overplayed, and even some of the scenes in the final car-testing area could've been cut (particularly the goofing in the heat/water rooms). My desire for a trimmer cut doesnt excuse the US version's butchering, however.

Really, Twin Dragons is worth 2.5 stars, but the sub-par US dvd keeps me from rounding up.

BUT the vast majority of them are exceedingly enjoyable nonetheless. One of the unique aspects of Chan's HK films is that they are primitive in a modern world. Had they been made 30 years earlier, he would be considered a master of the art these days.
If you can accept that ""TD"" has a plot that has been done literaly dozens and dozens of times over the decades, by everyone from Jerry Lewis to Cheech and Chong to Patty Duke, then this film is a hilarious and exiting take on that formula.",997228800,2,1272,4.653333333333333
1036520,3,6305492069,"This movie was made on the heels of Jean Claude Van Damme's own twin flick, Double Impact.  Chan not wanting to be outdone by a mediocre talent made his own. With hardly any fight scenes this movie relies heavily on the site gags and confusion caused by the Chan and his brother ""almost"" being in the room together.
The final fight scene in the auto factory is well worth the wait and another gem of a display of Jackies skills.  The rest of the movie I could have done without.",994032000,,478,4.3
1036521,3,6305492069,"I haven't as yet seen this DVD (I fully plan to as Jackie Chan dubbed on this release I am told).  The 3 stars are for the movie itself.  It is not the best Jackie Chan Hong Kong movie, the Police Story series and Project A 1 & 2 are much better but is definitely worth a look.  I have seen an old dubbed version (OK) and the Asian DVD release (better).  Before approaching any ""old"" Jackie Chan film (ie. ones done in Hong Kong before America!) viewers should be aware they are lower budgeted so don't have the capacity for special effects as in US movies.  Also, what a Chinese considers funny might not necessarily be what a westerner thinks is funny!  Keeping this in mind, I really liked this film.  The story is ""old"" (ie. twins separated at birth and coming together later in life with the expected mix-ups) but with Jackie (twice!) it is a lot of fun.  The last action scene in the car factory shows Jackie's amazing acrobatic and martial arts skills to perfection.  If you are Hong Kong movie buff, there are a lot of cameo appearances by HK actors and directors.  Jackie did not direct this film, so ignore any criticism of bad direction by him!  Most of the films Jackie directed himself are superb action pieces, though the acting is not very good in some.  Jackie is more interested in action than dialogue, though ""Accidental Spy"", his latest Asian release, is extremely good in all aspects, both action and action, with a good storyline.  Anyway, give Twin Dragons a look - it will be worth it.",991526400,6,1509,4.463503649635037
1036522,4,6305492069,"Twin Dragons is fairly typical of the recent Jackie Chan Hong Kong films that have been re-released lately.  The film, when Jackie isn't fighting, drags along.  The comedy is the broad farcical humor that is popular in Asian films.  It's a hit or miss thing.  I like it more often then not but it is definitely not for everyone.  The special effects aren't the greatest when the two Jackies are on screen together but still not bad considering the low budget and lack of a Hong Kong ILM branch.  I like the setting.  I've always enjoyed Jackie's films set in Hong Kong.  I also enjoyed the supporting cast.  Maggie Cheung is cute and spunky as usual.
The reason I rated this film with a four, and not a three, is because of the final fight scene.  Most of the film is lacking in action, which is what makes the usual slow points in his other films easier to take.  Here there are really two considerably brief action sequences early in the film and the grand finale.  The fight in the auto factory is as good an action sequence as I've ever seen in a movie.  Jackie shoots through the windows of cars like most people walk through a door.  The stunt where Jackie pulls himself up and over a wall before a car smashes into it has to be seen to be appreciated.
I would recommend buying this film only if you're a fan of Kung-Fu or Asian films but I would also suggest renting it to anyone.",990489600,3,1387,4.325581395348837
1036523,2,6305492069,"Great stunts, decent story, good fight scenes, but some of the action was just plain silly.  Most Jackie Chan movies try WAY too hard to be funny, and this one is no exception.  It just isn't funny and the attempts are silly and unintelligent.  They should just stick to fighting and stunts and they'll be fine.  Jackie Chan is terrible at comedy.",982540800,,347,4.548387096774194
