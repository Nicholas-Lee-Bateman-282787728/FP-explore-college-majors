He said he also learned from the interviews with the people who designed the roller coasters.  However, he likes video footage from the front seat on roller coasters and there was little of this.",1203292800,3,292,4.82

8031902,5,B0002TSZL0,great my kids love them they watch them over & over CANT wait more to  come i'll be looking today,1389225600,,97,3.85
8031903,5,B0002TSZL0,"This is a great movie!
It teaches you how to have lots of fun at a theme park{without getting motion sickness}.
And if you've seen other Popular Mechanics for Kids videos, you know about Charlie's Tip{which usually has an expiriment, as well as a tip},and Mechanix, with Nix and Tix.
But on the other hand, if you haven't seen any Popular Mechanics for kids videos, then I suggest you watch this one, and other videos in the series.
I hope you like it as much as I do!
Because this is one of my favorite non-fictional science series.
And I hope you think so, too.

8031904,5,B0002TSZL0,"My 6 and 8 year old boys love learning about roller coasters, especially some of the science and engineering involved with their design and construction.  This video delivers for that, and my boys have watched it many times.  Having kids as hosts on the video is great, too.",1360713600,,274,4.6875

Another interesting group of programs. Be a clown, join Circue du Soleil, find out how they make rides safe and fun.
What makes us get motion sickness? Get this dvd and learn.
My 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.
This was a series on tv at one time, apparently. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show was fab.
Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.
Some are surprising but all are interesting, informative and professionally made.
In earlier reviews of this series I forgot to mention that grown ups find these programs interesting as well.
My husband and I love them as well.",1260057600,2,1007,5.758389261744966
