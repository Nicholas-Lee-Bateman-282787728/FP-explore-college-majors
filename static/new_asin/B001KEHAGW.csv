3664480,4,B001KEHAGW,"The secret of Saya is finally revealed in the fourth volume of the dark, vampirish anime known as ""BLOOD+"".

The popular 50-episode anime series that was shown in Japan back in 2005-2006 and also in the US via ""Adult Swim"" on the Cartoon Network finally starts to catch some steam with more developments on the past of Saya.  What we have learned in the previous three volumes is that Saya is a person that has a special power and with the Red Shield, they set out to the road in an effort to destroy vampires aka Chiropterans and Diva, their queen.  Representing Red Shield is David who watches over Saya and her two adoptive brothers Kai and Riku.  Saya is aided by Hagi, who happens to have a special ability in order to protect Saya and joining the team is their bodyguard Lewis and Red Shield doctor Julia Silverstein.  You suspect something about Saya because she always receives these blood transfusions and her blood somehow powers up her sword and her eyes turn glowing red before she decimates her opponent.

In volume 4, the group now ends up in Russia to look for some leads on Diva and the Chiropterans and a doctor who may have created them or clones of them.

The following episodes included in this volume are:

  1. Episode 16 - Siberian Express - While on the train ride through Russia, the group is attacked by two Chiropterans and Saya and Hagi go to battle.  But for David, he questions how two of the Chiropterans can get into the train?
  2. Episode 17 - Do you Remember the Promise? - With Saya and Hagi thrown off the train in the last episode, both walk for shelter and start to begin their search for a doctor who was experimenting on cloning.  They end up meeting his daughter who wants to help them but is she really the daughter?
  3. Episode 18 - Moon Over Ekaterinburg - This episode focuses on Kai.  As Kai continues to feel that he is worthless in the battle against the Chiropterans, he is given back his father's pistol and while David and Lewis are investigating a building, they are attacked by a Chiropteran.
  4. Episode 19 - Broken Heart - The secret of Saya and Haji is revealed!  Eliza is revealed to be a Chiropteran who had been disguised as her (the original Eliza was killed in episode 16) and tells Saya everything about her and why she has been experiencing unusual dreams.
  5. Episode 20 - Chevalier - The secret of Saya becomes a shocker, especially when Kai finds out the truth about Saya.  Meanwhile, Diva's Chevalier's get together and try to figure out a plan on how to get Saya and Haji knowing that Saya's blood can kill them.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""BLOOD+"" was created for television and the video is presented in 1:33:1 full screen.  The animation is quite nice with character designs by Chizu Hashii, which this series is his first as a character designer.  The backgrounds are quite nice as the series tends features outdoor and indoor scenes but because this is more or less a vampiric anime that is quite dark and violent, the anime has it's dark feel to it.  But otherwise, I felt the anime was pretty cool and stylish.

As for audio, audio is presented only in stereo.  So, there are not much effects being used on all speakers but if your concern is voice acting, the English dub work is well done as the voice of Saya is done by popular video game and anime voice actress Kari Wahldren and popular anime voice actor Crispin Freeman does a great job as Hagi.  And the Japanese voice work is awesome!  Both Eri Kitarmura and Katsuyuki Konish also do a great job and the same goes to the others for their voice work.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, there are no special features included.

The fourth volume of ""BLOOD+"" is quite significant because it finally reveals what Saya and Haji truly are.  Why she has these special abilities and how her blood causes fear amongst the Chiropterans!

The animation and artistic backgrounds are done quite well in this series and for those who are looking for an anime that is dark, violent and bloody and action-packed, definitely can find that with this anime series.  But if there is one thing to remember is that ""BLOOD+"" is a 50-episode anime series, so you can expect around 12-volumes total.  It's a kind of series that you want to stay in for the long run.

As for the DVD, I do wish there were some kind of special features included.  Commentary or production stills, or textless opening or ending.  Something at least.  Well, there is one thing that you will see in ""BLOOD+"" and that is the inclusion of the sponsor stills that typically follow the intro theme in Japan.

For those who have been curious about this anime series, the first thing I must say is that if you are wondering if ""BLOOD+"" is a continuation of the ""BLOOD: The Last Vampire"" series, the answer is ""no"".  This is an original story and it has spawned not only anime series but manga and video games as well in Japan.  Second, because this anime series is unrated,  this anime although shown on Japanese television, is definitely not appropriate for young children.  There is plenty of violence and blood in this series.  So, that is another important tidbit to know about this series.

Overall, the series is well done and I enjoyed it.  It helps to have that awesome theme song by HYDE singing ""Season's Call"" kicking off the intro of the series and cool characters and dark villains.  So, you get a fair amount of action with each episode.

Volume 4 is pivotal and important in the series, so if you have the first three volumes of ""BLOOD+"", you definitely want to check this one out!",1234051200,19,5570,4.540160642570281

3664525,4,B001KEHAGW,"It is not a secret that I am a fan of anime.  While I may not be a devotee as some people are, I thoroughly enjoy many anime series.  I just finished watching the series Blood+, a 50-episode series that aired from 2005-2006.  The best way I could summarize my feelings about this series is that it is both entertaining and underwhelming.  It actually really kind of hurts me to say that, but I will explain.  As a rule- SPOILERS.

Plot
I suppose the best place to start with any series is the basic premise.  Here is a place where Blood+ really kind of was hit and miss.  The basic overview is this- a girl wakes up with amnesia and one day is attacked by a monster.  She learns that she is the only one who can stop these monsters because of her blood.  That is the story at it's most basic.  From here there are a lot of side stories and plot twists and other details.  I think that had the plot kind of stuck more to this basic premise, the series would have been stronger.  As it is, you really need to pay a lot of attention to this show.  For those that are willing to invest the time the payoff is rewarding.  The story takes it time and really wants to flesh out it's mythos.  That being said, this is an anime and there are certain tropes that are to be expected.  I find that when I talk to people who don't watch anime regularly or are new there are a lot of elements that are present in many anime shows that they have a hard time wrapping their heads around.  This stems from a basic cultural differences.  One of the big things that animes do that I have noticed is in regards to their dialog.  It is not uncommon to hear plot points that the audience should know all about be repeated- a lot.  Blood+ is no exception.  I'm not sure why this happens in so many anime series, but it does seem to be a common thread.  Overall, some people have critized this series for having a plot that is too thin, but I disagree.  I think that it becomes far to convoluted at times.  Trying to keep up with the 7 plus protagonists and 5 plus antagonists, not to mention the many side characters, can be a challenge.  As I stated earlier though, if you put the work and effort into this it can be a plus to the series.  I would have preferred a smaller group of main characters so that we could really get them to be a bit more fleshed out.  Which leads me to my next point.

Characters
For me, this is where the series really falls flat.  While the writers do spend a good deal of time on back-stories for the many characters, that is about all we get from them.  Once a character has been established, they really don't ever change.  Even between Series 1 and 2, in which a year elapses, there is really no growth from any of the characters.  The only character to have any kind of growth is Solomon, one of the main antagonists.  I'm going to focus on a couple of the characters to give an idea of where this is coming from.  Let's take a look at Sya, our main character of the series.  Many people say she is a vampire, and 2 movies have come out specifically stating so in the title (Blood: The Last Vampire).  I disagree with this idea.  Not only does she rarely suck blood (I can think of only about 3 times in the entire run of the series), but it is obvious she does not need it for sustenance.  She is shown eating regular food all of the time.  She is also out in the sun a lot.  For the purpose of the series though, I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing.  We learn about midway through the series that she is one of the Chiropteran, or the monsters she has been fighting.  Not only that, she is the first.  This has an expected affect on her as she struggles with this new information as well as disturbing truths about her past.  What we learn about Sya's past is that she can be a killing machine, at one point taking out almost an entire village during the Vietnam War.  However, the Sya of the series is not that- ever.  This makes sense at the start of the series as she has no idea who or what she is.  When she begins to fight she is understandable pretty bad.  She clearly knows how to handle a sword, but it is clumsy at best.  We would expect this to change, but it doesn't.  Even during the year when she is doing nothing but hunting Chiropterans she never improves as a fighter.  This is one of the biggest drawbacks of the series for me.  While everyone talks about her as this great savior, I wouldn't trust her in a schoolyard brawl looking at her fighting.  Because this is a show and she is the hero, she prevails, but it feels forced.  This may also be because the good guys are shown as really weak and the bad guys are shown as stronger and faster and altogether better.  Maybe they were going for the drama of having an opponent that was really strong, but it feels cheap.  I am a gamer and this is a tactic that lazy game designers will sometimes use.  They make the opponent ridiculously strong to increase the 'difficulty', but all it does is add frustration.  It would have been much more satisfying to see her develop as a fighter over time to meet the challenges of her opponents.  Instead every fight involves her and at least 1 other person fight a single enemy, whether it be a regular Chirpteran or one of the Chavaliers.  And the victories won always seem more deus ex machina than skill.  In an action series this is a huge misstep for me.  The audience is never given the opportunity to see a fully realized fighter in Sya, and so we never see a fully realized hero.  On top of that issue, she never emotionally seems to grow.  Despite the war going on around her, she always seems like the teenager we met at the beginning of the series.  To be fair, though, so does everyone else.
  To see this in action, look at the main side characters in her mini-army.  Kai, her adopted brother, starts the show as a whiny 16 year old boy who doesn't know how to handle the responsibility thrown at him.  This is understandable.  What is harder to comprehend is how after fighting in this war for a year he still seems the same.  He may not whine as much, but he still is crap with weapons, has no real way to defend himself, and moans about the same things over and over while throwing more temper tantrums than a toddler whose toy has been taken away.  David is the military vet who is too into his job at the cost of relationships, Louis is the comic relief, Joel is the head of the organization who doesn't appear to do much to stop anything, etc.  Once these archetypes are in place, they do not move.  One side character, Julia, is handled extremely clumsily.  She starts off good, then appears to switch sides, then comes back.  All with little explanation.
  The most well-rounded character is Haji, Saya's Chavalier (or protector).  This is ironic to me as he is the most deadpan character in the entire series.  Except for a couple of flashbacks Haji does not smile or show emotion of any kind.  Yet we see him change during his life.  We meet him as an adult and then get his back story, and then see him change at the end.  Granted, the change is not handled particularly well, but at least it's something.  On the topic of Chevaliers, Saya has 1, Diva has 5!  There is a slight change during the second half of season 2, but that's the ratio, 5-1.  On top of that, they are all super powerful.  Where Haji is quiet and mopey, Diva's protectors all have personality.  It doesn't change, but it's there.  One of my favorite characters is Nathan, one of Diva's chaveliers.  He knows what he is and uses it more to enjoy himself than anything.  He has a sense of fairness humor that really adds a lot to the show.

Verdict

Overall, if you are a fan of anime or action this series has something for you.  It does drag and would have benefited from maybe having only 25 episodes instead of 50, just to force the writers into making things a little tighter.  The characters, while mostly flat, are likeable.  The biggest disappointment for me lies with Saya.  My introduction to her was through the movie 'Blood', which takes place during the Vietnam War, when she was already a powerful warrior.  To see her go from the killing machine that was always referenced to a meek school girl, and never really come back was a bit of a let down.  During her big showdown with Diva it would have been great to see 2 combatants fighting with everything they had, but sadly that is not the case.  The twist is good, but ultimately not enough to fully redeem her character.

Outside of the cool action, the great Voice Actors and Actresses, the artwork, there is a developing plot that hooks you in.  Because while Saya Otonashi gets closer to her target we learn more and more about her background.  I don't wish to spoil it for you, but we learn a few shockers.  And we also realize that Diva's protectors have plans for Saya.  Too bad there are no extras but five episodes are good enough.",1245801600,,575,4.588235294117647
