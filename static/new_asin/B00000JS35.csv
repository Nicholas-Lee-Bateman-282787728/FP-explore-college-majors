7913458,1,B00000JS35,"While the wolves are indeed beautiful, they are obviously captive wolves living in an enclosure.  The narration is extremely dull and surprisingly uninformed. The video is overpriced and extremely short. If the Porters are knowledgeable about wolves, there appears no evidence of it in this video.  For a considerably lower price you can purchase some of the National Geographic films on wolves and observe real professionals at work filming real wild wolves in their natural habitat and actually receive an education at the same time.",985564800,16,535,5.2823529411764705
