But since it's been over a month and you still can't even locate the movie to send it to me and I have found it else where I will be canceling my order and getting my money back. I tried to give this a half a star for effort but it won't let me, you got lucky and got a full one. Thanks,",1200528000,,340,3.608108108108108

7951349,1,B00005QY8Z,"I was fooled! I thought this had something to do with the COPS TV show. Not at all.

This is a set of not ""B"" movies but ""C"" movies from the 50's and 60's. Totally unknown actors and movies which have something to do with investigation or police (as 80% of movies often have).

It is a discrase to even sell this sh**t!!",1116201600,5,320,4.063492063492063
