I have never seen Hackers before, I figure that if it is in with these 2 it has to be good.",1368316800,,247,3.769230769230769
8196832,5,B000QQJ3R4,"It's great to go back in time to see what the early days of personal computers was like!  ""Hackers"" and the shadow of what looks to be Bill Gates in ""Ant-Trust"" can leave you speechless!  Then throw in ""WarGames"" as if it never really happened.  Very soon the games will be over. All I would need is ""The Net"", ""Firewall"", and ""Enemy of the State"" to round out this trio!",1325462400,,371,4.271428571428571
8196833,5,B000QQJ3R4,"This collection contains some great films that have strong computer hacker/espionage themes. The first film, ""War Games"" stars Matthew Broderick as an underachieving high school student and computer enthusiast who inadvertently starts a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia after hacking into a government artificial intelligence system, which he thinks is a prototype video game. Of course, this sparks a race against time to thwart the destruction of the world as we know it.

The film was shot in 1983, so if you don't mind the quirks of movies from that era this should be an entertaining thriller.
Next in the lineup was ""Hackers"" starring Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie. This film is by far the most delinquent of the three. A group of young cyber criminals end up being blamed for a computer virus they didn't plant, which leads to them having to expose an elaborate cover up. If I were to grade this movie on its accuracy in the portrayal of hackers it would be a negative 4 stars. However, movies are meant to be entertaining, and quite honestly most people would rather watch paint dry than pay to watch a true account of a hacker's life.

The last film, ""Anti Trust"", posed the most plausible storyline within this collection. The film stars Ryan Phillippe and Tim Robbins. Phillippe assumes the role of a recent college grad, who also happens to be a computer genius, and Robbins is cast as a Bill Gates type software tycoon who wants to recruit the youngest, hottest talent in computer programmers and he has his eyes set on Phillipe's character. Phillippe and his best friend part ways because of their differing ideologies about supporting the free software movement and working for software giants (like Microsoft). Shortly after starting his new career, Phillipe's friend turns up dead, and he has a growing suspicion that his new boss is somehow behind it. There are a lot of twist and turns in this film, and the acting is quite good. The film also deserves a gold star for staying true to the technology without losing casual watchers whom have limited experience with computers.",1258761600,2,2107,4.85
