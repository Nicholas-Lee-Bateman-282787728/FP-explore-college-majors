5054031,5,B0074B2N8A,Two great works of animation for the price of one! It is a two disk set so the quality of both the transfers are great instead of it coming together on one disk. If you are a fan of animation this is definitely worth picking up for your collection.,1424217600,,248,4.081632653061225

5054033,5,B0074B2N8A,"I got this set here for five dollars at Best Buy about a year and a half ago, and I am highly satisfied with this set.

First thing that needs to be made note of is that this is not a one-disc-two-films garbage release with no special features. This is a two-disc set featuring reprintings of the original discs, retaining all the features on the original discs.

Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is an interquel to the original TV anime by Sunrise. This is an excellently paced and exciting action film, with all the film noir smokiness and charm that gave the original its unique feel. Special features for this film are abundant, with three language tracks (English, Japanese, French), Japanese-to-English subtitles, French subtitles, English dub closed captions, interviews with the English and Japanese casts and crews, character studies, character biographies, concept art, storyboard comparisons, and clean opening and ending videos of the songs ""Ask DNA"" and ""Gotta Knock a Little Harder"". There are also a ton of trailers, including this film's original Red Band theatrical trailer, as well as trailers for xXx, Steamboy, Memories, I Spy, Bad Boys II and Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis.

American Pop is an historical fiction drama directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of adult animation's leading creative minds. It follows the story of four generations of an immigrant family whose lives revolve around popular American music. It's a superb drama with an amazing soundtrack, and should not be missed. Unlike Bebop, Pop has significantly less in the realm of special features. You get the main feature, English and Spanish stereo audio tracks, English, Spanish and French subtitles, and the original theatrical trailer. But really, the movie is good enough to stand on its own, so the special features don't need to be extravagant.

Altogether, this felt like a steal, as if I was paying $5 for a $30+ value. Pick this one up. It's worth every penny.",1421539200,3,1939,5.05
5054034,5,B0074B2N8A,I haven't seen these movies since you could rent VHS at the video store.  Finding them both together on a dvd set was amazing!  Watching them again was awesome!  I now remember why I always said these movies are great!,1395100800,,218,4.4
5054035,5,B0074B2N8A,"I am a fan of animation. But I am actually a big fan of both anime & Ralph Bakshi. I think they are the best examples of good classic, traditional animation.

Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (Anime) - I love Cowboy Bebop. The show is incredible, and the movie is just as good. So good you can just watch the movie without seeing the show and still get a good idea of whats going on and what its about. Well written, beautifully cinematographed, and a killer famous English voice cast: Spike voiced by Steve Blum (Toonami Tom), Faye voiced by Wendee Lee (Konata from Lucky Star), Jet voiced by Beau Billingslea (Barret Wallace from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children), & Ed voiced by Melissa Fahn (Gaz from Invader Zim). The movie is one of the best anime films made.

American Pop (Ralph Bakshi) - If theres anything I am, Im a huge Ralph Bakshi fan. His animation is fantastic. I personally think his bad ones are good, but don't worry, this isn't one of them. I actually think this is one of his masterpieces. The animation isn't like his early work, this is actually at a time where he was going through his rotoscoping phase. But that doesnt stop how dramatic and how deep the story goes. Well crafted with great music latter on, and great psychedelic art backgrounds.

This is over all a great buy and a high recommendation to people who love good traditional animated motion pictures. A must buy!",1383350400,2,1394,4.5458167330677295
5054036,5,B0074B2N8A,"Two great films for under 10 bucks.  Hard to pass up.  I paid around 12.00 for my Cowboy Beebop movie alone.  I would bet this is a repackage, where the studios rounded up movies that were not selling and repackaged them.  Nothing to be weary of though.  Most repackages go without a hitch...

Film wise these are two good choices.  Cowboy Beebop: The Movie is one of my favorites.  I am a big fan of the tv series and this movie catch's much thunder from that.  It's not a perfect film, but a good view none-the-less, especially at this price.  For those not familier, Cowboy Beebop's basic premise is a group of bounty hunters in space trying to make ends meat.  Many times failing miserably.  The action is intense, the landscapes the animators create are truly awe-inspiring AND this is one series that seems to have a lot of science on it's side.  The characters float on their ship, wormhole gates are used a lot.  Technical stuff that matters to me is mostly correct in this film.  If you have not ever seen the tv series, watch it early Sunday morning on Cartoon Network/Adult Swim at around 3:00 to 4:00 a.m.  I am not sure of the exact time.  Better yet buy the series and watch it in one massive Anime weekend.

American Pop is a highly praised film that I will honestly say I have never seen.  It is by the great Ralph Bakshi, who created Lord of The Rings the animated classic, Fire & Ice and Wizards, amoung other creations.  I have seen A LOT of positive reviews on this film, so it's safe to say it is not a stinker.  I just have never seen it, but I may now.

All and all I think this is a good deal for anyone who likes Anime, and has not seen either of these projects.  Although technically American Pop is not Anime.

Anyway If I didn't already own Cowboy Beebop I would buy this 2 disc set.  Who knows, if you are really a penny pincher Amazon may lower this price even further around the holidays, if you can wait that long.

Hope this review helps you, and as always remember to help control the pet population: make sure and spay and neuter your dogs and cats.  Convincing you dog to hold still while you do it, that's your problem...",1333497600,7,2158,4.316708229426434
