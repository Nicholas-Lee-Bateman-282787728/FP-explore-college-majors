2125870,5,B0002VEV0M,"It's simply amazing how the fine people at Troma keep sinking to new and unheard of lows in their pursuit of true independent ""art"". It is safe to say that there has never been a film to wander this far over line in terms of pure filth and perversion.
Gratuitous lesbian sex, dismemberments, blood, guts, anal sex, ku-fu action, terrible dubbing, amateurish acting, freakish mutants, vampires, aliens, the production value of a cheap porno...it's all here, and in abundance. There is NO plot and it makes NO sense whatsoever. It is TALES FROM THE CRAPPER, and it has no equal...it has no peers...and it has NO point!(other than being absolutely hilarious that is)
TALES FROM THE CRAPPER is pure b-movie bliss. If you are a Troma fan, you are going to love this. However, if you are easily offended or prudish, please stay far away from this movie...you have no business watching it. This is a movie for only the most hardcore of Troma fans and ""bad"" movie lovers.
If the above description looks like a good time at the movies for an obviously twisted individual like yourself, then by all means indulge. If not, turn around and run in the opposite direction as fast as you can!
With TALES FROM THE CRAPPER, the Troma Team has outdone themselves once again. This movie is not for the weak of heart...
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
The DVD boasts some nifty and colourful packaging, not to mention a TON of Tromatic extras including a 60 minute documentary on the making of the movie, deleted scenes, interviews, commentaries, trailers, and alot more Troma-riffic goodies.
This DVD is worth every penny, do yourself a favour and invite THE CRAP KEEPER into your living room.
YOU WILL BE TROMATIZED!!!",1097193600,4,1692,4.758503401360544
2125891,1,B0002VEV0M,"I've watched a ton of stuff from Troma and this is by far the worst film they have ever produced. This is even worse than the stuff they put out on those Triple B-Header collections. I'm all for stupidity, nudity and cheapness in films, but this movie is pretty much an insult to anyone with even 1 functional brain cell.

This film looks like it was made for 5 bucks. The acting is horrible, which isn't really anything new for Troma so I can let that slide. However, the annoying Boner-Vision pops up way too often and the jokes are so lame even a 5 year old wouldnt find them amusing. Ha ha, farting noises every time someone bends over and gay voices for guys with big muscles. You can tell that zero effort and thought went into this. Do yourself a favor and don't waste time watching this crap. You're better off watching Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD or even Demented Death Farm Massacre over this.",1303344000,,895,4.424242424242424
2125892,2,B0002VEV0M,"Even by Troma standards, this is pretty low.  Not because of the filth, sex, perversion and general goofiness--I like that stuff.  But the execution here is rather slipshod.  Really seems like stuff that they would otherwise have thrown out, put on display to make money.  At least the title is accurate.  But there's too much Lloyd Kaufmann.  He has a few good lines, but he's not as funny as he thinks he is.  Debbie Rochon is wasted in a small but potentially funny (and completely clothed role).  Julie Strain is best in pieces where she is overbearing, which is most of the time.  But when she's not on screen, the movie slows to a crawl. For me, there was just too much tedium and not enough laughs.",1247356800,3,705,4.488188976377953
2125893,4,B0002VEV0M,"Some more nasty cinematic spewage from Kaufman and the Troma squad.  If you like eating your own excrement(who doesn't?), you'll love this film.

The Tales quickly unfold with irrefutable astuteness and profound underlying themes.  Of course I'm talking about naked chicks.  Seriously, for the first 45 minutes there are more breasts served up than at Chic-Fil-A.  Strippers giving up the goods, how romantic.  It does get kinda hard to sit through.

Then thankfully the gore and madness start to kick in, Troma style.  There's some dazzling raunchy bravado, like when everybody's favorite 75lb serpent shlong goes backdoor on the lovely young lass.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't totally captivated.

This is some good clean fun.  Well, not really clean.  If you're a fan of Troma, you oughtta love it.  If you're a fan of the mass media wicked corporation mind control ignorant spoonfed monopolizing enterprising cinematic sludge conglomerate, [...]",1236902400,,953,5.190789473684211
2125894,5,B0002VEV0M,"Lloyd Kaufman hates this film. I'll admit it was pretty bad but I love Troma and cannot give it anything less then five stars. It has alot of nudity but thats not what the film for me. It was the overdubs. I loved when Troma has overdubs in there movies, its always funnier then most comedy films out today. Kaufman is a genius and his films may suck from time to time, but when they overdub the lines, its the funniest thing you'll hear for weeks.

Plus, Troma always gives the best dvds. There dvds are always full of great extras, mostly the same trailers over and over, but still good.",1225756800,,589,4.306306306306307
2125895,5,B0002VEV0M,"Tales from the Crapper is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver. The one that has brought us innovative and original REAL independent films for 30 plus years now: Troma. This is truly a very special film because it manages to be certainly not my favorite of the Troma-productions, but released on a disc that because of what I just said is one of my most valued and favorite DVD's. Not only counting the countless Troma discs I own, but counting my entire collection of films. The film itself is the result of an ill fated plan to produce a television series to be directed by a director who was trusted with a substantial amount of money (especially for Troma) to make something wonderful and delivered a lot of unfinished and incomphrehensible material before quitting (or being fired, I am not sure which at this moment). In order to prevent having to shove a vast investment down the toilet Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie. One movie that really consists of two, in the nice old Tales From The Crypt anthology fashion, hosted by the Crapkeeper played by Mr Kaufman himself. But, as I said, not quite my own favorite of all their movies. That is greatly due to a weird sense of discipline at the various sets, forgetting about the hard Troma rule of ""no booze on the set"" which was discovered by a furious Lloyd and other less respectable emplyees that Troma had at the time of the filming of the added scenes. All this made it all but impossible for Mr Kaufman to make a worthwile product in the editing room.

But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the troubled added scenes to an already misshapen startproduct he crafted not much less of a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as circumstances would allow the most brilliant

filmmaker to slice together and it is certainly highly entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with those elements that made Troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind. As a film itslef, though, not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. The genius of Independent Cinema however made the DVD of this film so much more than a release of a film with some extra's. The film is, when push comes to shove, actually only a part of the entire dvd that in its whole is a document of the difficult situation serious filmmakers find themselves in having to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few Very Big Ones who don't really allow any other players on their market turf. A document of the problems one has when trusting people to be on the level, only to find out that freedom sometimes is something that is hard to live up to and realisation that access to a Movie Budget when the Boss is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better.

The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS it, and doesn't want to make anyone think he believes it is. The full-length commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan's audio commentaries), mixing humor, sneers at those who deserve it and highly interesting information for anyone interested in Independent Filmmaking in such a fashion that watching the film again with this commentary straight after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting it is hard to stop. The feature-length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where Lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there. We see him somewhat desillusioned sometimes, different from his appearances in other Making Of Documents such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both to be found in the must-own MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE box set.

The added scenes with James Gunn (who started his carreer at Troma only to find success as a writer an now a director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone to start out with a Troma-released work, to later be a national hero with his South Park series) are entertaining and probably (as is much else on this release) a reason for obtaining this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters.

Loaded with much more than I could mention here (including a SECOND audio-coommentary) this is one of the best Troma-dvd-releases.",1152489600,4,4343,4.613195342820181
2125896,5,B0002VEV0M,"I can't understand why ""Tales from the Crapper"" only has a collective three star rating. This masterpiece cinema born from the ingenius mind of the master of comedy/horror Lloyd Kauffman is absolutely brilliant in every way and form. Starring the beautiful and perfect Julie Strain (who predictably bares her breasts in nearly every scene that she is in), tons of lesbian sex, full frontal nudity, violence and gore, and a ""Crapkeeper"" costume that should have won an Grammy award for its ingenuity and sophistication. Plus, there is the novel idea of ""boner vision"" to gain the attention of the disinterested viewer. Even if you only watch this film for the commentary scenes by Oliver Stone you will not regret it. Also, there are surprise appearances by Ron Jeremy and Trey Parker.
Check this one out!",1143676800,3,804,4.962962962962963

8033019,2,B0002VEV0M,"Even for Troma, this film is tasteless with gross scatological humor and nasty sex/gore scenes. But strangely, I did find the documentary/introduction by Lloyed Kaufman, founder of Troma, incredibly fascinating. Mr. Kaufman wanders around Los Angeles, with a camera pointed at himself, talking about all the trials and tribulations making this cinematic mess. You get a chance to see raw and startling behind the scenes footage of a group of awful filmmakers who were trying to complete this movie. This particular Troma film took 3 years to complete due to the sudden departure of producer India Allen. She quit, leaving a half done pile of unusable film. Kaufman rallied together a bunch of losers including writer Adam Jahnke, one of the directors Chad Ferrin, special effects guy Jim Ojala, line producer John Santos and A.D. Alisa Christensen at Troma Los Angeles, to finish this thing. The shocking part is Lloyd Kaufman had no idea what was really going on behind the scenes. He looks at the video clips and states his total disgust, anger and disappointment at all the goings on. The filmmakers are busy sitting around, smoking, drinking alcohol and occasionally filming with gross incompetence. You see one scene where they are busy guzzling down gin, vodka and whiskey and throwing up over the side of the Troma building. Its kind of sad as you hear the frustration in Kaufman's voice when he admits its his fault for being weak, not cracking down and basically giving up on the film. Its strangely compelling, seeing Kaufman in this serious and vulnerable form.  In another scene, Wes Craven drops by for a visit and after he leaves, the loser filmmakers start mocking him behind his back. Tragically, in the end, Troma Los Angeles is closed down and you see one of the guilty filmmakers knocking the Troma sign down with a sledgehammer. Mr. Kaufman makes a humorous final comment: ""if that *&%$#@!! worked on the film as hard as he is knocking the Troma sign down, maybe we would have a good film.""",1400198400,3,2010,4.87719298245614
8033020,1,B0002VEV0M,"Wow - a new low for me!!!  I KNOW that if Julie Strain is in a movie, it will be really bad, with lots of decent to great T&A viewing.  but beyond that the poor quality of the acting and the really cheesy FX are what makes most of these movies at least fun to watch when you want to become a vegetable infron of the TV.  But this thing is pure CRAP - FAR BEYOND it's title!!!  Save your money unless you are a VERY hardcore Julie Strain fan.",1367020800,,441,3.8666666666666667
8033021,3,B0002VEV0M,"The film starts out with a lame introduction followed by a second lame introduction. Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz need to release no one watches the movies to see their faces or hear their stupid monologue filled with dumb homosexual bits. The film could have also eliminated the feces material/jokes and just stuck to an occasional fart joke. Real movies don't need introductions.

Like a ""Family Guy"" episode, there is no real plot. The movie is about silicon strippers, mostly removing just the tops. Julie Strain removes her bottoms. It appears that the scenes in the movie of her at home were actually shot in her home. The movie boasts a certain type of vision which is nothing more than a small screen insert with a stripper. Loosely the plot of the first film is an alien space craft comes to earth and an alien is killing people at a strip club. Julie goes undercover to investigate. In the second film lesbian vampires strip for college boys as a fund raiser.

There is satire in the film. It makes fun of news, news reporters, cops, and Oliver Stone. Much of the humor was done with voice overs, aka ""What's Up Tiger Lily"" style as sexy dancers sound like they are males, and males at the strip club are made to sound gay. This worked fairly well as did Julie Strain as a ""Dirty Harry"" cop. Unfortunately there wasn't enough of the good stuff, so they used ""crap"" (literally) to fill in.

More nudity in the DVD extras, including more of Julie Strain. For those who can't get enough of Ms. Strain, I suggest watching the DVD extra of ""Delta Delta Die.""",1306713600,2,1565,4.562277580071174
