7926859,5,B00004Y7IB,"I'm not familiar with Berlioz' Te Deum, but I've watched this DVD several times and am very impressed with the music and performance.  Abbado drives the chorus, orchestra and organ to give a performance with a powerful impact, with a beautiful and dramatic result.

I'm also very impressed with the Abbado and VPO performance of Wagner's Meistersinger overture, a really clear and beautiful reading that lets you hear all the inner voices, and you can appreciate how complex the orchestration is.

A real winner of a disk, for those who like their Berlioz and Wagner.",1232496000,6,567,4.947368421052632
7926860,5,B00004Y7IB,"As of November 2007, this is the only DVD of the Berlioz Te Deum.  This is a massive and powerful perfomance in Franfurt's Alte Oper, an opera house transformed relatively recently into a concert hall with spendid acoustics and a terrific pipe organ.  Additionally, the rich hardwoods of the hall and the gleaming organ pipes are beautiful to look at.  The close-ups of singers and orchestral musicians are well placed and well timed.

Jose Carreras sings the tenor solo with his usual high standards of musicality and personal involvement, but overall he does not seem comfortable with the part, as he shifts back and forth between light head tones and a heavier, more operatic chest sound.

Ironically, the excellent concert hall is the only substantial problem with this performance:  Berlioz's huge Te Deum calls for the resonant acoustics of a large cathedral church.  For example:  the Denon CD of a performance in the vastness of the Cathedral of St. Join the Divine in New York City.  Therefore this performance lacks clear definition among the various choral groupings, especially the two boy-choirs.  On the other hand, soft orchestral passages and solos are clearly audible and supported by appropriate visuals.

If this DVD had worthy competition, I'd rate it with fewer than five stars - perhaps with four - but it has no competition at all.

The ""filler"" on this DVD is a performance of Wagner's Prelude to Act One of Die Meistersinger, also with Abbado conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.  The concert hall's acoustics are perfect in this case, allowing one to hear all of the details of Wagner's famous orchestral interweaving of the central themes of the opera",1195862400,7,1677,5.0108303249097474
