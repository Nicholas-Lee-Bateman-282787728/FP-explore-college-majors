5768380,4,B00D2UMHMO,"The video starts out with a short warm up, then you go into exercises where you are basically moving one leg for rather long periods of time. Tracy has you do all the exercises for one side all in a row, and then you switch to the other side. After the legs/butt exercises you move onto the abs section. Basically everything is a variation on a crunch. This is followed by a ""standing abs"" routine that is I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E to follow. She offers no instruction on how to move or in what direction, or what specific muscles you should be targeting. I found the standing abs to be absolutely ridiculous and I end up fast-forwarding through it because I look and feel like a total fool! After abs you do arms for a short period of time. A cool-down routine follows with a few stretches.

Overall it's a really great workout! The style of this video is really cool and modern. The music is good and it is rather relaxing! I've never been a huge exercise fan, but I feel motivated to do this workout. I enjoy it. It's hard and at the end, I feel really accomplished! You definitely need this!",1271548800,18,1089,4.417910447761194
5768421,5,B00D2UMHMO,"I really like Tracy Anderson.
I know her cues can be off and she whips her arms around a lot...
But.. SERIOUSLY you see RESULTS!!
That's all I want!!!
I take my time and do what I can - doing her workout for a day I see a difference.
If I put in two weeks with 30 minutes of cardio 6x's week - doing low 'healthy' carbs.
I'll drop a whole size!
Can't beat that!
I've done so many other workouts for endless weeks and don't see dramatic results as I do with Tracy!
So here's to being healthy and slim!",1421798400,4,500,3.9603960396039604
5768422,5,B00D2UMHMO,"I have several Tracy DVD's and love them all. I know that when I do her workouts that they are accomplishing things far different than usual routines. One has only to experience 'recovery' from one of Tracy's workouts to understand! I feel an all-over tiredness that isn't just a few key muscle groups, rather the whole body is involved, just as she says. I am working hard on this one.  This DVD is beautiful to watch and a real challenge to accomplish. One must intuitively understand the moves and find the coordination to do them, which comes with time and some effort. Definitely not easy, but worthwhile! I don't give a hoot about incorrect cues, sorry! The point is in learning the moves and doing them in sequence. You will barely need to look at the screen after some time and dedication. I am 54 by the way. I was pretty intimidated at first, but after 4 months and 6 times a week, I am learning a whole new approach to strength and flexibility! I have lost my belly, tightened my lower body, greatly improved my posture, cured an unstable knee... AND I am looking forward to wearing a sleeveless dress next summer. (My first ever!)

5768451,1,B00D2UMHMO,"I felt like I was supposed to watch her work out.  Her moves seemed to make her feel better, but it was hard to get past her facial expression.  Most instructors intend to teach, she seems more concerned with how she looks. She is pretty, but who cares?
I will say she had some good butt toning exercises, but it was only about 10m of the hour...the rest was just rhythmic dancing.",1402099200,5,381,4.277777777777778
5768452,2,B00D2UMHMO,"First of all, I would like to say couple words on Tracy's choice of clothing in these series: she wears no bra, and the stuff she wears it not athletically appropriate. You can see she is super uncomfortable herself, tugging at her top and pants all the time. Plus, the body grease and the pouty mouth. I think the standing arm series were not well thought through, and she often looks flatfooted and tired. BUT: if you work out with her, you end up with a pleasant feeling of tiredness, like after her better videos. I own almost all of her videos, and this was not a worthy purchase. If you'd like a bang for your buck, I suggest you go for her Mat Workout Video.",1401321600,5,665,4.285714285714286

5768455,2,B00D2UMHMO,"I literally just finished this DVD...It was my first time, so I may edit later.  I really like Tracy, as she has a different way of doing things.  I feel it too!  I really am not crazy of her free-style stuff because she says that they have a purpose (arm/hip movement stuff) but yet she doesn't show you how to do them here.  If there is a purpose, it really isn't free-style for us...right?  Also, in this video, there are some exercises that I just am not getting.  First time though, so I will I'm sure.  When you first start a video though, and are not getting a good portion of them, it doesn't make you want to continue.  At least, not me.  I wish I would not have spent my money on this one.  There are a few moves that I like.  I will try it some more, but think I will end up taking what I like and incorporating it into my own routine rather than following the DVD.  I do not recommend this one.",1398124800,,906,4.056497175141243

The camera swoops around her and the production and music are nice...but what's the point of that if you can't follow her.  I'm a pretty fair athlete and can follow dance moves so I gave this a try but just got frustrated with the lack of description.

I am 47 and an intermediate to advanced excerciser and have quite a collection of workout dvds. I loved this one as much as her Mat workout. I was able to follow along and the moves were enjoyable-I felt very stretched out and exhilarated after. The only moves I really dislike by Tracy are her standing abs-I feel so awkward and silly but I just improvise my own moves during those.

I am using this DVD to improve my Karate stances, and tone up.  It's really fun.  She knows what she is doing, and I have DVD #2 and #3 in this series, and each one evolves further with more difficult moves.  I'm very pleased with these DVD's, even if the moves look a little strange at times.  If it works, that's all that counts! Out of all the other DVD's she has produced that I checked out, I thought this series of three separate DVD's was her best work. Her Perfect Design Series - Sequence  DVD's, 1 through 3 are great.

This works you from head to toe. I agree that tracys workout are not meant for everyone but if you be patient with her your body will never be the same  again. I hated her workouts when i first started doing them but with patient I was able to understand what she is after. I have done every workouts under the sun and tracys workout gave me result like no other. My second favorite workout instructor is tonique. Even my friend who hated her workout before is now addicted and only do tracys workout.

5768501,4,B00D2UMHMO,"I know Tracy gets a lot of flack for her lack of cueing, and uneven reps.  But in this DVD she addresses these issues.  So, if you want results quick you must try her workouts.  I've been working out since the age of 12 (20 minute workout anyone?), I'm now 42 and probably in the best shape ever.  After having two kids I never thought I'd see my old shape return.  I tried it all from running, t-tap, Jillian, and barre.  I was toned but my abs never really came back, my love handles were still lingering and my hip flab was still hangin'.  Low and behold I tried Tracy's Mat workout on a lark.  At first I wasn't sure if I liked it.  It seemed too simple to really work.  But then what?  Obliques appearing?  Yay!  And my hip fat was melting, my legs looked amazing, my butt lifted and my outter thighs tighter.  Hallelujah.
The Perfect Design workouts are the next step to Tracy's Mat workout.  She has you do many reps on each side, and does not talk over the workout.  She relies on voiceover while doing the entire workout with you.  You will FEEL IT.  The lying abs section is challenging and really tightens and flattens.  My only complaint is her standing abs and unweighted arms sections are lacking.  Her movements are too fast and seem less coherent compared to the Mat Workout.
I often read complaints from career workout gurus or trainers who can't wrap their heads around Tracy's unconventional style.  But she's not for everyone.  If you like lots of bulk & bulging muscles this is not the workout for you.  If you prefer defined ""beauty"" muscles, sleeker muscle structure then try it out.
The other thing I love about Tracy is she does the entire workout with you so it feels like you have a workout buddy.  When you feel like quitting you'll be inspired not to.",1376697600,68,1780,4.422839506172839
5768502,2,B00D2UMHMO,"I own many workout DVDs and I have been a fitness instructor for many years.  As someone knowledgeable about fitness, I can honestly say that Tracy Anderson is duping the public, and is pretending to know how to instruct the public about how to achieve fitness.  This is one of the worst workouts I have ever seen.  The first section is supposedly a warm-up, but it is Tracy Anderson standing and moving her arms and body in all different directions without any instruction or explanation as to what she is doing, how she is doing it, or why she is doing it.  The next section is on the floor, with Tracy moving her legs around while on her hands and knees, but she also moves her upper body around for some reason that she doesn't explain.  The next section has Tracy in a bridge position with her arms behind her, doing strange in and out movements with one leg at a time, which is not only very hard on the wrists, but which makes no sense from an effectiveness standpoint.  Then she moves into an abdominal section which is okay because it's basically just variations of crunches and leg lifts while lying on your back, and while it's not always easy to follow what she's doing, it's easier to understand than the rest of the workout (which isn't saying much).  I would have given the workout 1 star, except for the fact that I believe that the abdominal section is acceptable in terms of form and effectiveness.  The next section consists of standing arms, which shows Tracy flailing her arms wildly and moving her torso and hips around in different directions.  As with most of the rest of the workout, there is no instruction, no explanation as to the purpose of the specific movements or the reason for them.  Tracy Anderson also gives an interview on the DVD, and repeatedly states that her mission is to help people find perfection in their body;  I find that ridiculous since there is no such thing as achieving perfection and anyone who strives to achieve physical perfection will only end up frustrated.  There is nothing in the interview that discusses the science behind what she is teaching.  That is because there is no scientific basis for what she teaches.  Plenty of people, including celebrities, have claimed to have achieved success through Tracy Anderson's teachings, but I take it all with a grain of salt.  I am sure that the people who claim success are doing far more than the Tracy Anderson Method in order to get their results.  The other ridiculous thing about this workout DVD is that Tracy's face looks annoyed and angry and like she can't wait for it to be over---just like anyone who is doing the workout will feel!  There are so many other excellent and qualified fitness instructors with great workout DVDs on the market---I strongly urge people to pass on this one.  It's not worth paying a penny for.",1376611200,14,2839,4.621513944223108
5768503,4,B00D2UMHMO,"The voiceover is really weird.. and she does a lot of  free style stuff, I wish there was a bit more structure and better direction.",1376524800,6,132,4.28
5768504,2,B00D2UMHMO,"I have been using TA's Mat Workout and loved it, so I was excited at what appeared to be the release of a new workout series.  What a disappointment.  Unbeknownst to me, this was simply a re-release of a 2010 workout, which you can tell right away by looking at TA's appearance.  Nonetheless, the one downside to the Mat Workout was the lack of direction. Well, that was nothing compared to this video. She almost NEVER tells you when to switch sides, the voiceover is boring and it is much more engaging to have an instructor talk through the workout while they do it. The BEST (meaning, worst) part is once the legs and abs are completed, TA just begins dancing and gyrating without ANY direction whatsoever. In fact, everyone I have showed this to LAUGHS at what a joke of a workout the second half is. She makes these weird movements with her abs and arms and you are simply supposed to follow along, which is impossible to do when she is not even following any sort of pattern. I am amazed this video was re-released because you would have to assume other people complained about the utter lack of direction in the past. Its shameful, to be honest. Glad I only spent 9.99 on this.",1376438400,24,1185,4.451612903225806
5768505,4,B00D2UMHMO,"Tracy's Perfect Design Series (PDS) came out a few years ago, and I never purchased it since the cost was so high for all three DVDs.  When I saw that it was being re-released, I decided to spring for the first two, and I really like them so far!

As I mentioned, this is a re-release, so it's the exact same workout as the original PDS Sequence 1.  (I just want to caution everyone so that they don't accidentally re-purchase a DVD that they might already own!)

The workout comes in at about 50 minutes, and is broken down as follows:

*  Warm-up -- about 4 or 5 minutes
*  Toning on the floor -- about 30 minutes
*  Toning while standing -- about 15 minutes

To do the workout, you'll want a mat and perhaps a set of one-pound ankle weights (although I'm not strong enough to use them).

If you're new to Tracy Anderson, her emphasis is on doing what she calls ""muscular structure"" moves to work the smaller ""accessory muscles.""

The workout will definitely work you from head to toe, and I was pleasantly sore after doing it.  I have pretty much all of her workouts, including Mat, Post-Pregnancy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Glutecentric/dp/B00BPDJHUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Glutecentric</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Hipcentric/dp/B00BPDI5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Hipcentric</a>&nbsp;workouts, and I found some really unique moves in PDS1 that I hadn't encountered in any of her other DVDs.

From what I have read online, a lot of women use Sequence 1 for a few weeks, before moving on to Sequences 2 and 3.  Tracy usually tells you not to do the same workout more than ten days in a row so that your body keeps making progress.

If you're new to Tracy Anderson, you may want to start with her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-Method-Mat-Workout/dp/B008DL4JVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson Method: Mat Workout</a>&nbsp;disk or the brand-new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Method-for-Beginners/dp/B00D2UMHC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Method for Beginners</a>&nbsp;DVD that just came out instead of PDS 1 to get used to her method and moves.  That being said, she does have much better cuing in this video than she has in the Metamorphosis workouts; there is a voiceover where she talks to you and gives you form pointers.  Don't expect too much emphasis, though, on how to do the moves; when I do any of TA's workouts, I'm always left wondering if I'm doing them quite right, and even reading her book didn't help me with that.

~~ Hope that helps! :-)  ~~",1375747200,82,2813,5.867321867321867
5768561,5,B00D2UMHMO,"As with all the other Tracy Anderson workouts (Method Mat, Metamorphosis, Dance Cardio, Rebounder/Trampoline--which is really AMAZING by the way) I have tried this Design Series and found it very challenging and exciting with unique stimulating moves (truly found NO WHERE ELSE in the exercise world) that I really have to push myself through every time. Some other reviews complain that Tracy does not gives much verbal instruction, I personally can't stand smiley over-exuberant instructors (Denise Austin makes me cringe...) and once you have done the workout a couple of times it all comes really naturally. This workout is for people wanting to change their workout routines for the long-term, so beyond the first workout I don't think you would really want constant chanting at you from a video unless you require belittling coddling to finish. If that is the case, this workout may just be too challenging. I find her brief comments and relative stoicism helpful and not distracting. She's guiding me through very complex work which demands your full attention and commitment, it should be serious she's not my bff.

Additionally, reviewers who do not like the standing abs section are not engaging their abs! These are VERY effective but you need to hold your ab muscles tight engaging them the entire time, you are certainly right that flopping around will not help you improve your form! It's easy to critique a program when you aren't willing to really work at it. Tracy's method is all about form so doing each movement with energy and precision is required. Go for a jog if you can't cut it...

Love you Tracy! Never change! Just give us more incredible challenging workouts! I will never go back to running on the treadmill and hours of weight lifting with little results :)",1370217600,14,1788,4.956666666666667
5768562,4,B00D2UMHMO,"You know, I really like Tracy Anderson, especially her toning moves.  She comes up with some really TOUGH, EFFECTIVE, CREATIVE (i.e. FUN!) strength workouts.  They are also relatively slow and easy to follow.  No problem there.

BUT...And there is a Big BUT - Her dance-like standing abs and arm work can be nice and effective (as in her ""Mat Workout""), or it can be a stressful hot mess (as in her ""Perfect Design Sequences II and III). This is the conflict that I face when I do her workouts.

The good: I love the lower body, ab mat work, and I even liked the standing ab and arm work in her ""Mat Workout"" DVD, but during the ""Perfect Design"" series, my enjoyment started to flounder.  While her lower body work was always wonderful and solid, her standing abs and arms moves became messy and rushed...and just not fun and not all that effective.  Why?  Mainly because you're spending more time frozen about which direction to move in than actually moving and working your muscles.  It's so bad that even with repeated viewings it doesn't get much better.  This is exasperated by the fact that Anderson COULD do better is she WANTED to, and just doesn't CARE to.

Yes, she is a creative and innovative instructor.  But she also, during my experience with ""Perfect Design,"" comes across as a bit arrogant and very lazy.  She HAS to know that the consumers of her DVDs, the people who help her earn her livelihood, her ""fans,"" if you will, want her to provide more instruction.  She knows this and still refuses to do it.  I think that speaks volumes about this woman's priorities.

Nonetheless...In my opinion, ""Perfect Design Series I"" is the least challenging and EASIEST TO FOLLOW of the 3 ""PD"" DVDs.  The moves are challenging and effective, but not crazy hard like Level 3 (I LOVE the chair work in Level 3!  Soo tough!).  Most of the moves are done on the floor, with the shorter standing abs and arms sections done on your feet.

While on the floor, you are put through a series of moves that work one side in a row, then are taken through a repetition of the moves working the other side of the body.  Some of my favorite lower body moves here: a move where you are on your hands and one knee while your working leg bends, lowers down, straightens behind you, then bends, is raised and is straightened diagonally towards the ceiling - NICE!; this ultimately transforms into another move where you rock forward and your hands and one knee, bringing the working knee to tap the ground diagonally, then raise and straighten the leg at a diagonal across your body to the opposite corner of the ceiling, repeating without a break - OUCH!, especially right after the previous move!  I also love the move where you are lying flat on your stomach and raise one leg slightly off the floor, out to the side, in to the other foot, rest briefly and repeat - KILLS the butt muscle on the working leg!

The floor ab work is also pretty solid.  It consists of unique variations of crunches and lower ab leg raises that really start to burn my abs by the end of the segment.  You begin with crunches done with your legs straight in a V.  You ultimately progress to crunches and held crunches while your legs are doing all sorts of acrobatic movements.  Very pretty, but also pretty tough. :-)

As I've mentioned, the standing abs and arms are the easiest to follow here.  Because of this, I get the most burn out of them here in ""PD Series 1.""  I flailed around hopelessly for just 3 or 4 days and then could generally keep along with the craziness!  Furthermore, my obliques and arms were burning by the end of the segment.  You then do a balance movement, composing of raising and lowering your left leg and right arm simultaneously before switching to the other side.  You then go back down on all fours to work your glute and hip with some awesome moves (while on all fours, you raise your bent leg out to the side, just like you were pretending to be a dog on a fire hydrant(!), then whip your leg straight out to the side , lower it then repeat).  After several reps, you then cross the same leg in a curtsey move behind your resting knee and then whip it out straight to the side and repeat.  Whew!  These moves are such a killer on top of my already-fatigued lower body that I can never get through them entirely without resting.

I'm really enjoying this...And then there's a stretch near the end that has Tracy leading you SILENTLY through a stretch that's done WITH YOUR HEAD DOWN!  Really??  Again, Tracy's laziness and refusal to do common sense instruction comes to the fore.  All she would have to do is TALK you through it.  She would only have to say, ""And now raise your right hand straight up.  Lower.  Now your right...""  But she says nothing, KNOWING that you are straining your neck awkwardly while your bent down on knees, head to the floor.  She knows what is right, and she refuses to do it.  I like Anderson, but that kind of ticks me off.

But ultimately, I really enjoyed this workout and wore it out well until I finally moved on to Level 2.  I would recommend this...to people who like results, like creativity and are not anal about things like ""proper instruction.""  :-)

UPDATE:  01/02/14: So Ms. TA has come out with a few new DVDs with - get this - detailed instruction!!  Nice!  :-)  Well, there you go.  I officially have no more complaints about the Tracy Anderson Method! She rocks for doing that! She is now, in my opinion, among the upper echelon of fitness instructors (next to Sylwia Wiesenberg of Tonique Fitness, Jessica Smith and any of The Firm instuctors, that is...).  :-)",1369094400,6,5615,4.4940711462450595
5768563,4,B00D2UMHMO,"Ok, so all the negative things the other reviewers commented on?  The weird costume she's wearing, the fake tan, the shimmer lotion, the odd camera angles, the annoying music, the strange production...those things are real.  And they are annoying.  Sometimes I get distracted watching Tracy in her gray satin knickerbocker pants, working it out.  And there are parts in the music that make me wonder what the producers were thinking.  The DVD is trying so hard to be slick and cool.

But none of those things have to do with the workout you'll get if you do this video.  Despite all the weird issues, it's still a good workout.  For the standing abs, I mainly just do the sort of standing abs she demonstrates in the mat workout.  If I watch the arms section before I do it, it's a lot easier to follow.  And this is something I have to do with her videos anyway, because the arm movements go so fast that I can't follow along unless I kind of know what's coming next.  For the part where she tells you to put your forehead on the floor and follow her arm movements, I can watch it first so I know what to do, and then just do it.  I love how that section works my arm muscles against gravity in a weird new way. Then I give myself the nice stretching session I know I want and need.  It's easy to adapt this to fit better, and rotate it with the mat workout so it doesn't grate too much with the annoying parts. I'm glad I got the mat workout first, so I'm a little bit familiar with what she does, and that makes it easier to figure out.

Also, I think Tracy learned a lot from this series, and I think it improved her skills as a trainer and as a DVD fitness coach.  She's not marketing this series on her website any more, and the exercises in Meta are filmed in a much simpler way that's easier to see and follow.  I think she took everything she learned from doing this, and used it to create something better.  In the meantime, while I save up for continuity, I plan to do this series and get stronger and familiarize myself with more of her exercises.",1363910400,7,2059,4.251928020565552
5768564,5,B00D2UMHMO,"I'm new to Tracy Anderson. Truth be told, I resisted her for a long time. But I'm so glad that I ignored my judgment and gave her DVDs a shot. I could not afford Metamorphasis and I found the box set on EBay for a VERY reasonable price!

I love the setting of this DVD. I love the coloring and the way you feel like you are in Tracy's private studio (which it may have been) working out one-on-one with her. The best way to do this series of DVDs is to ***watch the DVD before attempting to do it.*** The moves are complicated and require a lot of focus and attention to detail, so watching it before, skimming through will help you to grasp what she does. Also, listening to her explain it helped me correct my form while doing each of the moves. The lower body section is really fun and I like that she encourages you to use your arms in the moves and stay active throughout your whole body. I do other workouts besides Tracy's and using my arms and legs gracefully is very new, but I really enjoy it. It keeps it fun and fresh!

The ab section is tough! :) You've got to pay attention to the screen to see when she switches legs during moves because she may not queue. But after doing it a few times, I knew when to change.

The standing abs and arms was the most difficult to follow as I don't believe Tracy had a solid routine set up going into filming. I think she went with the flow of the moment and I find that's what she wants her viewers to do as well. At first I felt very confused, but I just went with it. Again, after a few run throughs I am getting better at it. You have to pay attention to her wrists and elbows, but it will come with time.

The cool down is nice. I did find it odd how she walked off and rolled her eyes abruptly as if she hated doing the DVD. haha. :) But it was a tough one!

All in all, I really love this DVD. It challenges me in new ways. It definitely takes time, patience, practice, and dedication. You won't get it right off the first or second time (especially the arms and standing abs) but keep at it. Once I let go of expectations and let this stuff stand on its own and not comparing it, I really appreciated it.",1357430400,2,2161,4.063380281690141

5768569,4,B00D2UMHMO,"after reading all the reviews on tracy's perfect design series, i decided to buy the box set. i just got it today and watched it through and i must say it's a lot better than i thought it would be after seeing some of the comments here.

it's true she makes a few mistakes on the voice over which is the reason i gave her 4 stars just like some other ppl here as well.

but what i like about this dvd is that most of the moves are a lot more fun and versatile than than the ones in her mat work out dvd. But for the standing abs and the arms section i would just use the moves from the mat work out because the ones in this dvd aren't that good really.

i also like the setting. it's just so simple and not too bright which is great when doing the work out early in the morning or late at night.

can't wait to get started with this new work out!
i'll write a better review once i've finished the 1st sequence ( u're supposed to do it for 30 days and then move onto another one).",1322265600,2,979,3.88
5768570,5,B00D2UMHMO,"I should start off by saying that I was doing the Bar Method on and off for years, and the only real result I saw from it was huge legs, and really painful ankles and knees. Then I discovered Tracy Anderson's Mat DVD (no, I am not secretly on her publicity team) and thought, wow, this frikkin kicks my butts and is gentle on my joints!

I then went on to later buy her dvds on QVC (cheaper than on her website). Her Post-Pregnancy DVD is hardcore. Like insane. I've been taking a break from that and doing the Perfect Design Sequence 1 and I absolutely love it. I understand all the complaints--it's dark outside. She looks like a street worker. She does not provide play-by-play instructions. A light shines in her face. Her voiceover directions are bad.

Yes, there are some serious doozies. There is a segment in the cool down where your forehead is on the floor and you're supposed to follow along doing arm exercises. At this point I just do my own variations on her arm movements.

However, these imperfections are minor to me. Just because I'm over the hill does not mean I necessarily want to see someone in a full-on sweatsuit telling me every little thing she's going to do. That's really annoying to me, but I understand how that would provide comfort to others. And I like the option of being able to turn off the voiceover when it gets to that point. I am fine just watching and following along--you'll get the hang of it the more you do it. Ultimately, all I really care about is an hour well spent.

This is a fun, hard workout!",1318982400,12,1544,4.4070175438596495
5768601,2,B00D2UMHMO,"I wanted to like this workout, I REALLY did but I'm sorry the lack of instruction turned me all the way off. Here's the thing, unless you're the type of disciplined individual that will power through any and every turn off to get your workout on, then things like bad music or the lack of instruction will make you not want to bother with that dvd after the first time. I wish I were more disciplined but I can admit that I'm not which is why I try to find dvds that are fun, interesting and challenging so that I will be able to get over the lazy-ass within to do the workout and see results from consistency.  I have other dvds that I can do that are challenging and provide sufficient instruction so you can begin to pick up the moves after watching it 1-2 times because isn't that the point???? To learn the moves to be able to do the workout all the way through on a consistent basis???? I don't understand how you market an exercise product that people will use without you standing right next to them to guide and correct them but provide almost zero instruction. The cardio video is the worst in this respect, it's hard to even predict what move she's going to do next, how many times are we supposed to sit there and watch or flounce around doing the wrong move for the purposes of picking up the moves??? Why did she think there was no reason to include instruction? I knew there was less instruction but I didn't realize that there was ZERO instruction on the cardio part. I used it twice and then gave up because I wasn't excited about doing this workout - that's the kiss of death for me.",1317254400,6,1601,4.301324503311259

I can't speak to the effectiveness of it because of that issue.

5768605,3,B00D2UMHMO,"I adore my previous Tracy Anderson dvds & do like this series but there are some huge production mistakes! First, Tracy does not instruct while she performs but overlays a canned speech twice, one for each leg,  and she even says ""for the right leg"" twice not mentioning the left leg. The worst part is she does not tell you to switch moves so when you're doing moves looking at the floor you have to keep looking up to see that she's moved on to other moves or switched legs. Then the cameraman keeps doing close ups of her on the arm work cutting off essential detailed arm moves AND there's a blinding spotlight reflection in our eyes! So we're blinded and can't see her arms or feet movements while she stresses to pay attention to and learn her detailed hand and arm movements. When the camera shows her full on we can easily see everything perfectly. I think the cameraman thought he was making slick visual interest but really ruined a larger percentage of the arm work parts on all 3 videos. Where was the editor on this? It's not practical for real life workouts. They should have had real people use the videos before they released them on a large scale. The content is still good but these are not as easy to watch & use day in and day out as the first series that Tracy made. They have a high annoyance factor.",1307577600,19,1322,4.373983739837398

This works the whole body very nicely and avoids bulk or too much emphasis on the large muscle groups only.  These Design series give you a nice sense of strength and empowerment.  Even though the workout is very difficult, it's also very relaxing as ironic as that sounds.  It gives you time to focus on the connection with your muscles and body.  I recommend it highly.

There is one leg/butt exercise done in reverse plank position which is very difficult to hold on your wrists-so I drop down to my forearms and just concentrate on getting a good glute/outer thigh stretch at that point. There is standing arms/abs-whcih is way more sporatic-confusing than in Mat. The ab section is good-but short. I do like this workout but it takes a little practice to know what is going on. She ques quite a bit in a voice-over style. Once you really get the routine memorized-you can go with the music only option which is really smart for future use, especially if you do the workout frequently.

5768609,4,B00D2UMHMO,"I bought the perfect design series (I, II, III) because I was looking for some variety in my daily exercise routine. I have a libray of workout DVD's The Firm, Tae-Bo, Denise Austin, Jillian Miachels, yoga, etc. but was getting sick of lunges, dips, squats, w/ weights. I had heard of Tracy Anderson and knew that she had trained Madonna and Gywneth Paltrow, and they look awesome so...I went ahead and bought the set, not quite knowing what to expect.

Already (day 10) I can tell that these are going to change my body. The leg sequence is particularly right on for those hard to tone areas on the back side. Yes there are some gliches in the instruction, TA doesn't seem to realize viewers are a mirror image (so she instructs you to use the left when it is your right). Her cues lag and you can be well into a sequence before she begins her voice over instruction. She also does this pouty check me out face, which is a little weird unless you're in a bar. However, I'm willing to forgive all of these instruction/ editing gliches because I think the workout really works.
She recommends that you do the perfect design sequence 6 days a week and add her dance cardio. I prefer to be outside so I get my cardio from running, hiking, tennis, etc. These DVD's lack cardio, they are only for toning, but are great for that. I feel longer and leaner already.

One more thought...
Although I'm enjoying the workout, I don't necessarily agree with all of her exercise philosophy.(never lift a weight above 3 lbs??) T A advocates being the teeniest tinest you can be, however I enjoy being strong and even like to lift weights occasionally. (GASP) I think that balance is key and these seems to provide that for me.  They are not unlike the results I've gotten from yoga, if I only could dedicate myself to a more deciplined practice.",1281139200,27,1830,4.506024096385542
5768610,4,B00D2UMHMO,"I have the entire series of Perfect Design, but they build upon each other.  I have done this one probably 20 times now and so am ready to review it.  First, it starts with her typical warm-up, then you do floor work all on your LEFT leg, but Tracy in voice over cues RIGHT.  This is the reason for only four stars as this should have been caught in editing as this is one of the better produced exercise DVDs out there.  After your LEFT side is done and you want to yell at the television, but you're too tired--you start your RIGHT side which is cued incorrectly again.  Then onto abdomen/core work.  No planks in this one, but it's a good section.  For the ""standing abs"" Tracy does not cue much at all, less than she does in her original Mat video, but it is something you can pick up on with time.  Her arm sequence this time does NOT include weights, but what's cool is she flows into a balance sequence next which I like a lot because it does challenge you.  Then she does a little more arm/stretching moves and down to the floor on all fours again to finish off your behind :)  Tracy is evil (in a good way).  You do a little more arm work on your knees using the floor to cue which I enjoyed.  However, she gets a little funky and is in child's pose doing arm work WITHOUT CUEING....so you can't see what she's doing.  Again, you can memorize it and she ends the workout with a final stretch.  Again, I don't like the fact that she took the time to do voice over and yet cued the wrong sides 99% of the time (there is one point where she says right and you are ACTUALLY on the right during the first lower body section/last exercise), but you would think that little thing could have been caught in editing.  Again the music is great and Tracy is encouraging.  All the form pointers for the Tracy Anderson Method are throughout the workout, you just have to do it a few times to get it.  There is no equipment except for a mat needed for this workout and if you have sensitive knees make sure it's a thick one, I don't have that problem but I have heard a few fans do and use knee pads.",1272585600,71,2095,4.158808933002481
8588700,2,B00D2UMHMO,"I love Tracy's mat workout and have been doing it for about a year, so I figured it was time to expand my collection. Having read that the Perfect Design series has better cuing and some different exercises, I ordered all three (used, thank goodness!) and prepared to get to work.

First, the positives. This series has completely different moves than the mat workout, the studio setting at night is soothing, and Tracy speaks in a calm, measured voice. Now for the negatives . . . .

Despite being a trained dancer, Tracy's moves are completely disconnected from the music and often follow no discernible pattern. My impression is that the music was added in post-production, because there is no way that a trained dancer could have such an appalling lack of rhythm. If you're not particularly coordinated, this might not bother you. But if you're someone who can't stand to move out of time with the music, this will drive you crazy (as it did me).

As for the cuing, it's pretty much non-existent, especially in the standing section. I'm not asking for her to break it down step-by-step, but consistent reps and a ""heads up"" when moving to the next exercise would make it much easier to follow. The arm exercises are laughably bad--no rhythm, no pattern, no cuing. It just looks like Tracy made it up on the spot. I ended up doing my own thing while I watched her do her own thing. Super frustrating.

In sum, Tracy's lack of rhythm and consistency, as well as her poor cuing, make the Perfect Design series a frustrating experience. If you're new to the Tracy Anderson method, start with her original Mat Workout. It's a much better video that can be followed by almost anyone. If you really want to try this series, do what I did and buy all three used. At least you won't have wasted $30.",1495411200,,1794,4.579439252336448

Her slow, elongated movements feel like they're not doing much at first, but they catch up with you, and that is how you get to work the small muscle groups that make for a long lean physique. The large muscle groups are always quick to take over if you give them the chance. Tracy works you from the inside out. It's healthier for the body, too, less impact and optimum core strength.

The soundtrack is great with some nice percussion and soothing, steady rhythms. Hypnotic even. Indeed, I feel a deep exhilaration throughout the routine, and especially after! Tracy's voice-overs may not be the most descriptive. I believe some are missing the point to think that is important. I have come to realize that Tracy's methods become intuitive after doing them awhile. You must make an honest effort to understand the routine. If you are persistent, 'small muscle groups' and 'opposing forces' take on a meaning of their own. You'll figure it out! I love how working one muscle group hinges on another so you are actually working your abs while doing the arm routine. Working your legs works the butt and the abs, and so on...The last section, standing abs and arms, I wish was longer. True, there is not much structure in this portion. Perhaps it is not a good introduction to the Tracy method ""arm"" routine, but once you KNOW and have viewed another of her Dvd's, it is easier to follow and benefit.
