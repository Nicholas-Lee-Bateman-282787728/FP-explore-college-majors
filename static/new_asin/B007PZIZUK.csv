8520903,2,B007PZIZUK,"This video says it covers ""The Keith Moon Years"", but only as long as those years are 1964-68. It stops before Tommy!! Short of some interview footage with Shel Talmy, this is nothing but rehashed video clips already available elsewhere.

It's also only an hour. A good hour, I guess, but could be so much more. I still can't get over that it stops before Tommy.",1373760000,5,362,4.484848484848484
8520904,1,B007PZIZUK,"It's a re-release of The Who Under Review! If you own The Who Under Review DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
I wish I had known this before I bought it. The only redeeming quality is that the packaging is nicer!",1352764800,9,196,4.051282051282051
8520905,4,B007PZIZUK,"This dvd is a re-release of Chrome Dreams' film, ""The Who Under Review"". If you have not purchased that dvd, (as I unfortunately did), you will enjoy the program.
Chrome Dreams has a very bad habit of re-releasing their dvds under new names to resell old product. I wish they would stop this practice.
This dvd is very well produced, however, and the critics and writers who narrate do a fine job of telling the story of the early Who. There are many music exerpts, and the sound quality is very good.
As I said, if you haven't purchased the original dvd, you will enjoy the show.",1349740800,45,580,4.429906542056075
