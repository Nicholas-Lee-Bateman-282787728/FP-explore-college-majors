When watching the first, not only was I really entertained, I really wondered about the Predator: its history, where it comes from, etc. I  thought maybe the second would address this: perhaps giving us a glimpse at  his home planet. But it didn't: the closest is when it shows the inside of  his ship. And I just can't understand Danny Glover being the one to save  earth from an interplanetary hunter. Maybe Arnold's acting wasn't as good,  but at least he looks the part. And I also thought setting it in a city  would make it better: more targets. But it didn't. It was good in places,  and showed off more Predator weaponry, but I still have to recommend the  first.",927590400,2,742,4.404411764705882

PREDATOR 2 is the electrifying action sequel that unleashes the deadly Predator in another jungle; the crime-riddled futuristic Los Angeles becomes the target of an alien predator, killing drug lords and police alike. Danny Glover stars as a hard-headed maverick Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan and a federal agent Gary Busey as Special Agent Peter Keyes, who are up against a savage alien, set out to capture the creature, who has come down to Planet Earth from a distant galaxy to hunt humans for sport.

FILM FACT: Due to a dispute over salary, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred as ""Dutch"" in the 1987 film, declined to return to the sequel. In PREDATOR 2, the main Predator was designed to look more urban and hip than its predecessor. The MPAA in America initially gave PREDATOR 2 an NC-17 rating, so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating. Although it had negative reviews, PREDATOR 2 is seen as a cult classic among fans of the film.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: PREDATOR 2 [1990] to my mind is a much underrated sci-fi classic film. Here the Predator alien goes on a safari in the heart of Los Angeles, and in the process dispatching of various drug dealers, which we all cheer in the process. That is until he gets his alien infrared eyes fixed on the lion of the jungle, Danny Glover who stars as a hard-headed maverick Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan. Having the alien Predator in the city is a brilliant idea, and so many opportunities for good fun times violence, especially in the grime sleazy urban backdrop sure led me to believe that it was bound to happen and the film PREDATOR 2 is the kind of Hollywood sequel that just had to be made.

The story takes place in the future of 1997, a time when, from the perspective of 1990 when this sequel was made, it seemed possible that gang violence would completely overrun Los Angeles in the coming years. Here we are in the sweltering jungle of Los Angeles, where the ozone city is overpowered by ruthless crime lords. This is where we find the alien Predator is high above watching the scene below through his infra-red vision, playing audio recordings to itself over and over of the humans.

Danny Glover stars as a hard-headed maverick Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan, who is classed as a violent cop of such ridiculous skill that he single-handedly ends a street war that has been raging for hours when the sci-fi film opens. Along with his team, that is made up of Danny Archuleta [Rubn Blades], Leona [Maria Conchita Alonso], and the self-absorbed new guy Jerry Lambert [Bill Paxton] and of course Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan attempts to find out who has been killing both sides of the Colombian and Jamaican gang rivalry.

This mysterious third party has been stringing up either sides victims after skinning them alive. Taking over the investigation is FBI suit Peter Keyes [Gary Busey], offering no end of cheesy comments and his band of men in black, who collectively keep Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan from finding out what the killer is. But then of course, the audience already knows who the culprit is, and who comes from an alien race of hunters who kill for sport, yet it takes most of the film for Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan to figure that out on his own who the killer is.

The plotline of this sequel follows the original closely in its basic structure, in that the hero slowly discovers he is being played with, but ultimately proves himself more capable than the alien Predator. Very little new information is communicated to the audience, aside from a new-fangled Predator gizmo or two. When, in the last five minutes, Lieutenant Michael Mike R. Harrigan chases the Predator to its mother ship, and discovers that the alien hunters have been around for centuries, because one of the group of Predator aliens gives him an object that is from the year 1715 and gives it to Danny Glover as a trophy, and proves they have been coming to Planet Earth a very long time.

Creature designer Stan Winston, who developed the Predator creature, insisted on mounting a Xenomorph skull on the Predator ship in the finale of PREDATOR 2. While understandable that the filmmakers sought to illustrate how the Predator was a daring hunter capable of stalking the most dangerous beasts across the galaxy.

Watching PREDATOR 2 is in the most sense, is shot with admirable special FX, but sadly failed at the box office, but not for the fans of this film, and ultimately killed off anymore of the sci-fi franchise forever. The screenplay by Jim Thomas and John Thomas, writers of the original Alien film franchise; but instead of doing something innovative, did not quite do it. But despite this, I still love this film very much and so glad I have added it to my Blu-ray collection.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has presents us with a stunning 1080p image presentation that is enhanced with the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. With this sequel the film elements seem to be cleaner and generally stronger, and the colours are bright and strong and there are a lot of flamboyant colours in the costume designs. As to the contrast aspect of the film, this is very well represented, with exceptional good shadow detail, and especially with some scenes are, in fact, very impressive. But of course with some scenes around Los Angeles with the nigh time scenes are very dark and hazy, so giving a very eerie atmospheric scenic atmosphere. But with the opening hot sun drenched scenes in Los Angeles, the image transfer has an abundance of colours, and probably represents the best overall sequence in the film from a technical standpoint. But overall, it is the best image presentation you will ever view, unless sometime in the future, they bring out a remastered Blu-ray disc, which I somehow doubt very much.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment lets you experience this film with a very aggressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience, that is helped along with the Alan Silvestri's organic film music film score, that relates to the urban grimy location of Los Angeles. The dialogue is crisp and clean, and not overpowered by the surround sounds and even more spectacular is the overpowering creepy sounds of the punctuating sounds of the creature's frightening howl. The rear channels play an integral role in this audio presentation; gunshots and ricochets, for instance, are heard in the back in most every action sequence, that of course lets the back speakers work hard to create a realistic atmosphere throughout, especially with the sounds of the inside of police headquarters features phones, typewriters and keyboards, and plenty of chatter filling the soundstage and creating a good, almost seamless, environment. The bass thump sounds, makes the sound experience very rowdy, loud, exciting, but not quite reference quality sonic experience. But despite this, the sound experiences you hear go really well with this sci-fi sequel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Director Stephen Hopkins: Here director Stephen Hopkins introduces himself and thanks for joining him on his personal views on the film 'PREDATOR 2, here he talks about the opening shot of the skyline of Los Angeles and was filmed via a helicopter and also filmed with an infrared camera that the police actually use for night-time surveillance. With the great shootout battle scene with the rival gangs and the police, we are informed that this was a four day shoot, and the street had to be blocked off, which annoyed a lot of people. Stephan goes into great detail about almost every aspect of the production of the film is discussed at great length, but unfortunately Stephen presents all his information in the audio commentary in a very matter of fact, instead of making it a much more entertaining audio commentary, I suppose that is because he was heavily involved with the film and has to be much more pedantic about his personal aspect of directing his film. While editing the film, Stephan reveals he was given  pirate video tape of the film in rough cut and showed how the special effects was achieved and was really angry about this situation. Stephan gives great praise about the films composer Alan Silvestri, especially with certain scenes in the film, where he heightens the atmospheric music, where otherwise the film would be viewed very mundane if there was no music. By the way, director Stephen Hopkins looks back with some amusement on the film's datedness and excessive swearing and also informs us of a very funny story about making an idiot and fool of himself live on the American TV programme Good Morning America. Stephen Hopkins makes a very poignant about the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger made the right choice of not appearing in his film and instead decided to be the main star actor in the film 'Terminator 2' instead. When the credits appear Stephan mentions the director of photography Peter levy, A.C.S., who has been friends of him for over 20 years. As the film comes to an end, Stephan asks us that he hopes we had a good time listening to his audio commentary and wonders if there are more Predator films coming our way? All the technical information you could ever dream of or want to know all aspect of the process of making or directing a film, is here, and if that sort of an audio commentary is up your alley, then by all means check this one out, it is your choice.

Audio Commentary by Screenwriters Jim Thomas and John Thomas: Here Jim Thomas and John Thomas gives us their personal invitation to hear their views on the film 'PREDATOR 2 via this audio commentary on their involvement in doing the screenplay for both PREDATOR and PREDATOR 2, and also informs us that it is a very long time since viewing the film 'PREDATOR 2. But these two screenwriters are able to provide a much better insight into the history of the film as opposed to discussing the technical aspects of the film. When you see the one gang member up high on the roof top, and is shot by Danny Glover, well the stunt double that falls the street below, nearly missed the air bag, because of the way he fell off the roof backwards. Both Jim Thomas and John Thomas give great praise about the actor Gary Busey and they talk specifically about his character in the film that in real life would be part of the secret aspect of the American Government that no one knows about that is a department that investigates strange happenings going on. They give great praise about producer Joel Silva, and how he really shines out in post-production, and really makes sure each scene is very polished and always gives out great energy and enthusiasm with all projects he is involved in. Screenwriters Jim Thomas and John Thomas mentions that the digital special effects had just started to emerge when PREDATOR 2 was being filmed, but of course they mention that the digital effects in PREDATOR 2  now looks dated, compared to modern digital special effects we see in films today. As the credits appear on the screen, Jim Thomas and John Thomas mentions that a lot of hard work went into the film and they hope you enjoyed watching the film with their audio commentary, and also mention that they enjoyed watching the film again and enjoying all the memories of working on the film, and especially all the people they worked with on the film, and now and again like to watch films again that they have worked and been evolved with, and so ends another fascinating audio commentary that I really enjoyed listening to.

Special Feature: The Hunters and The Hunted: The Making of 'PREDATOR 2 [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [35:41] This special feature is split into four subject headings, and are as follows: ORIGINS; THE HUMAN SPECIES; THE PREDATOR SPECIES and SUBTERRANEAN CLIMAX. What we actual view is extensive behind-the-scenes look at the filming, in-depth views on comparing the first film Predator and of course PREDATOR 2. We get a lot of personal comments about the film from cast and crew, especially the cast talking about their characters in the film, but one hilarious aspect is the Gary Busey's his own personal rambling summary of the film's plot, which in his mind hinges entirely on the ""Quantum Theory of Gravity,"" and ""It's intangible to this time and space."" We also get to see the brilliant workshop that makes all Predator items and how much work goes into producing very realistic stuff, as well as all the tricks of the trade special effects. All in all this is a really interesting special feature. Contributors include: John Thomas [Screenwriter], Jim Thomas [Screenwriter], John Rosengrant [Stan Winston Studios], Stephen Hopkins [Director], Bill Paxton [Jerry Lambert], Danny Glover [L.T. Mike Harrigan], Michael Levy [Executive Producer], Gary Davis [Stunt Coordinator], Kevin Peter Hall [The Predator], Gary Busey [Peter Keyes], Joel Silver [Producer], Maria Conchita Alonso [Leona], Rubn Blades [Danny Archuleta], Morton Downey Jr. [Tony Pope], Stan Winston [Creature Creation] and R. David Smith [Stunts].

Special Feature: Evolutions [2004] [1080i] [1.37:1] [6:16] With this special feature, we get to view three separate subjects that relate to the 'PREDATOR 2 film, which are as follows: SOMETHING ON THE ROOF; ENEMY IN THE ALLEY and SUBWAY SHOWDOWN. Here we get to focus of this feature is the filming and techniques used to shoot all the special effects scenes from the opening title, use of light bending camouflage to the classic scene on the subway where Bill Paxton meets his doom. This is also a very interesting instructional video presentation, where it takes viewers behind-the-scene looking at the construction of several of the film's dynamic visual effects. We get to hear a very insightful audio commentary, but we are not informed who this person is. As usual, you can either watch each item separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Weapons of Choice [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [6:48] The focus with this special feature is the weapons and armaments used by the alien Predator in the 'PREDATOR 2 film, from the telescopic pole, self-destruct mechanism to the famous net gun! Here we have six separate features that consist of GAUNTLET KNIVES; SELF-DESTRUCT; PLASMA CANNON; NET LAUNCHER; SMART WEAPON and TELSCOPING SPEAR. Here we get a totally fascinating and very detailed look on how the different weapons worked for the Predator alien, and it is really great to see a much closer look at each of the weapons. As usual, you can either watch each item separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Hard Core Segments [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [7:05] Here we get to view two separate in one special video feature, that consist of HARD CORE SPECIAL REPORT: CITY AT WAR and HARD CORE FROM PENTHOUSE TO SLAUGHTER HOUSE: A SPECIAL REPORT. These two items are the actual news report you viewed in the PREDATOR 2 film, but this time you get the full video broadcast, with extra footage that was not featured in the film, and features the obnoxious Tony Pope [Morton Downey Jr.].

Special Feature: Promotional Gallery [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [12:26] Here you get to view three 20th Century promotional video features, the first one we view is THE PREDATOR GOES TO TOWN is an archival making-of piece relating to the 1990 film and features remarks from John Thomas [Screenwriter], Jim Thomas [Screenwriter], Stephen Hopkins [Director], Danny Glover [L.T. Mike Harrigan], Gary Busey [Peter Keyes], Bill Paxton [Jerry Lambert], Robert Davi [Deputy Chief Phil Heinemann] and Stan Winston [Creature Creation]. We also get some goofy nerdy comments from Californians on the street of Los Angeles. The filmmakers go over the basic story issues and not much more. Next up is INTERNATIONAL MAKING OF FEATURETTE and this is a very brief feature that has interview snippets of cast and crew members promoting the film, as well as some film clips and behind-the-scene clips and finally, CREATING THE ULTIMATE HUNTER covers some of the technical aspects of the alien Predator and its hunting abilities, such as the heat vision he uses to find his prey and once again we get comments from the likes of from John Thomas [Screenwriter], Jim Thomas [Screenwriter], Rubn Blades [Danny Archuleta], Maria Conchita Alonso [Leona], Bill Paxton [Jerry Lambert], Robert Davi [Deputy Chief Phil Heinemann] and Stan Winston [Creature Creation]. Problem is that a lot of what we view is repeated from the other above special features on this Blu-ray disc.

Special feature: Websites: Here you can access different 20th Century websites, but of course your Blu-ray player has to be linked to the internet.

Finally, PREDATOR 2 [1990] is a sequel that tries, and more often than not, succeeds at being a good sequel to some great over the top cartoon violence, with great aplomb. The final act is mightily impressive and Danny Glover pulls it off with great style and especially with the low-key blue lighting, intense build up, and over the top carnage inside the slaughterhouse is as white-knuckle as anything you saw in the first sci-fi film. The expansions to the Predator mythology are creative, sensible, and very welcome. Danny Glover is a fine protagonist who is more than capable of going head to head with the alien baddie. But keep in mind this film PREDATOR 2 gives the science-fiction fans what they seek in this sequel film. Its core is solid enough for broad genre appeal, and I for one love this sci-fi film and critics off this film should come off their high horses and get a life, as it is a film of its kind and nothing too deep or intelligence, just a rollercoaster fun ride and especially with Danny Glover at the helm. Highly Recommended!

383362,4,6301963725,"In this sequel, we learn whether a regularly-sized man can do as well as a Schwarzenegger-sized man when he becomes prey to an unrelenting extraterrestrial predator that lives for the thrill of the hunt. The first movie took place in the sweltering, sticky heat of the jungles of Central America. PREDATOR 2 is set ten years later in the near future of Los Angeles, circa 1997 (this movie was released in 1990). In La La Land it is the height of summer, temperatures having soared to a savage 109 degrees. Tempers flare. System's broke. The cops not in charge anymore. The streets of L.A. are become a war zone, the stage on which the Colombian and Jamaican drug cartels enact their bloody gang war. And a visitor from outer space, drawn to stifling heat and conflict, is about to partake in this feast of carnage.

PREDATOR 2 falls in the sub-genre of sci-fi horror, the most shining examples of which are ALIEN, its sequel ALIENS, and John Carpenter's THE THING. PREDATOR 2 isn't as good as those three, but it's still watchable stuff. Frankly, I loved the first PREDATOR so much that, back in 1990, I couldn't wait to dive back into this universe. The premise is incredible, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME juiced up to far-fetched extremes, given a fantastical twist.

Danny Glover is no Schwarzenegger, and the character he plays, LAPD Metro Command's Lt. Mike Harrigan, is no Tier 1 operator like Major ""Dutch"" Schaefer. Mike Harrigan compensates for his lack of elite military skills by being a loco loose cannon. He's been eighteen years as an LAPD cop, and they've been eighteen colorful years. Lt. Harrigan has a history of excessive force. He's wrecked eleven patrol cars, a city bus, and a street sweeper. They call it that ""John Wayne attitude."" Frankly, it's a miracle dude made lieutenant.

It was a must that Lt. Harrigan right away establishes his action hero creds, and he does so in the opening sequence as he abruptly, violently resolves a wild gang shootout in the streets. Just as Dutch headed up a crew of life-takers, Harrigan has his own mean squad of hardcases, composed of veteran detective with the fly wardrobe Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), the tough-as-nails Leona Alvarado (Maria Conchita Alonzo), and cocky, hotshot new transfer Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), aka the Lone Ranger from Rampart Station. Except, truth be told, against a towering alien spine-ripper, Harrigan's cop asskickers do about as well as did Dutch's guerrilla-fighting asskickers.

In keeping faith with continuity, there's passing mention of the incident in Central America ten years ago. It's a reference dropped by secretive DEA Special Agent Peter Keys (Gary Busey) and his government goons. Keys doesn't give a what about the gang war. He's after the new player in town, the grotesque thing what's been going around stringing up corpses, skinning their flesh, tearing out their hearts. Not even King Willie's Jamaican voodoo gang is that brutal and primal. The press and the cops think there's a psycho killer on the loose. But that's just putting a positive spin on it.

No, this sequel is not as great as the first PREDATOR. Schwarzenegger's absence is too much of a void to fill. The first movie is also more effective because it relies more on escalating dread and relentless suspense and - this is key - on your imagination to do the heavy lifting. PREDATOR 2 prefers to show you those horror bits like it's show-and-tell in the classroom. Honestly, there's nothing the screen can show you that your terrified imagination can't top.

If nothing else, there's the curio factor of Danny Glover's landing the lead action hero part. That's rare for Glover. Normally, he's the cautious sidekick muttering, ""I'm too old for this sh--."" Glover can't match Schwarzenegger's imposing brawn and physicality, and the Predator's taking out L.A. badges isn't quite as badass as eradicating Dutch's significantly more lethal team. But Glover has conviction when he springs into action. And his cops go out in honorable fashion. There's a sniff of social satire in that massacre scene on the MTA subway train. As you know, a Predator hones in on weaponized targets, and what a desperate state of affairs must it be in the near future of 1997 when most commuters come armed and trigger-happy. We're only -20 years away from such alarming dystopia.

But the hugest point of interest isn't the cast or the action beats or the gory kills. No, it's all about that one Easter egg that catapulted nerd hordes into conniptions. Harrigan, last man standing, pursues the Predator into his alien vessel and catches a glimpse of a trophy case - and displayed in that case, among other things, is an Alien skull. This eventually led to a stab at an Alien/Predator shared universe and spawned two movies: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004) and ALIENS VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM (2007). If I had my druthers, some nerd filmmaker will go for the Dark Horse Comics trifecta and make ALIENS VS. PREDATOR VS. THE TERMINATOR.",1511740800,,4982,4.902728351126927

Had to review it, decades late, just to honor how much mojo it still has.  If you have never seen this film, bullshit, but if you haven't, for God's Sake don't tell anyone and watch it pronto but first see the first one with Arnold, and then this one and then the other Predator films too, all in the same day.  You will thank me.  If not, you've wandered into the wrong neighborhood, Padre.  Best scooch yersef back to Bing Crosby movies.

Yeah, it's aged.  But wow how little it kicks you out of the film.  It gets slow when you know what is coming next all the time, but there were many actions segments that got me about 80% invested.  Lots of improbables and liberties were taken with the laws of physics.  For its era, it packed a smack.  But, yeah, lots of stuff pretty much memorized and that wrung the work dry, but as a historical piece, if it's been decades, heck yeah, refresh your brains about it.  It's a bookmarked moment in time for American culture, circa who cares watch it.",1471305600,,1117,4.3173076923076925

383647,4,6301963725,"It seems like this film receives a lot of criticism soley on Arnold Schwarzenegger's absence, but don't let that keep you from checking out this unappreciated sequel. The movie offers more than what what it seems. Has a few cliche scenes of course but a lot of the action scenes make up for it. I enjoyed this almost as much as the original predator. Glover may come off as a bad casting choice at first but he kind of grows on you once you get deeper into the film. Only setbacks about this are the phony street gangs and this annoying reporter that shows up from time to time. Other than that I'd say this film is a exceptional installment to the series. Unlike the other forgettable sequel ""Predators"".

LAPD is being overunned by violent street gang wars and in the midst of it all comes an uninvited guest looking to kill for the sport of it.

Danny Glover plays as the bad ass lieutenant Mike Harrigan along with his team: best friend  Danny boy, Leona (Conchita Alonza), and Jerry (Bill Paxton) as the new recruit looking to make a name for himself.

You really get to see a piece of Hollywood creature costumes with actors in the suits that's pretty much a dead field now. Not sure why we never got a 3rd movie back then, proly low returns, I would've liked to have seen where the franchise went around that era still.  I liked the city setting. Danny Glover is fine, not amazing but belnds well in the gritty atmosphere. Some sequences are shot too confined where it's hard to get a scope of what's going on.

384014,5,6301963725,"I absolutely love this movie, and now that I know it's on Bluray I'm sure I'll love it even more. Danny Glover who seemed such a random choice to lead the cast was spectacular; and he made the role his own. His presence in hindsight actually just added another chapter in time to the lore and legend of the Predator series. My favorite part about the character, Harrigan is how he calls nearly everyone an @$$hole as a rule. This movie has action, suspense, grit, comedy and really feels hot. You can just feel the heat (which is one of the attractive factors to the Predator out for a safari manhunt) as Danny Glover appears to sweat through every scene. It's really put together well with minimal if any CGI (I miss those days of movie-making).
I only wish it had been more successful at the Box office so that I might have seen Danny Glover do it again in a sequel, as we all know it's all about the dough. Oh well, I guess I'll just cherish this gem for all it's worth.",1446508800,,973,4.293478260869565

384324,4,6301963725,"Towards the end of a very heated gun battle between the LA Police Department and a Colombian drug cartel. Lt. Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) along with members of his team are able to force the gangsters into their hideout, where they begin to reload and prepare for another strike. Another gun battle takes place that the cops have nothing to do with. When the battle is over, the cops inspect the chaos and notice that the drug pushers have been cut to pieces. Later on, a Jamaican drug cartel suffers the same attack. Together with his team, Harrigan seeks to learn the identity of this new killer and put an end to his horrific acts. -summary

If there was ever a movie to take a bashing for some stupid reasons it has to be this one. Directed by Stephen Hopkins, Predator 2 was released in 1990, and it's a direct sequel to the 1987 film. Although the movie isn't better than the original and I can think of other reasons besides the fact that ""oh, Arnold isn't in it"", and ""oh, oh, it's not in the jungle this time"". It's still a solid sequel that delivers with the action to a certain degree.

This movie appears as if Hopkins is assuming that the audience is familiar with the original, since it's not very strong with the initial story, instead it expands upon it in several ways later. Now don't take this the wrong way, this is still a solid stand alone movie and it's not really necessary to see the original. The movie takes place in the year of 1997, 10 years after the jungle incident, and the Predator monster has entered into the city searching for suitable sport, and he comes upon the highly aggressive drug cartels and the battle hardened police force. The original movie was a tough one to follow, and the jungle atmosphere was definitely the perfect setting due to several elements that enhanced the feel, which somewhat propelled the film from just a plain old action movie. This sequel really doesn't use its setting the same way, as it trades off that sense of isolation for a more crime-laden cityscape. This wasn't a bad move, since Hopkins was able to deliver a little more in the action department in which the film delivers quite a bit.

There are some good moments here in the form of vicious shootouts; but it's the Predator whom steals the show with new weapons added to his already awesome arsenal, which helps increase the high body count. This film almost feels like it was trying to make up for the second half of the first movie in terms of action. Unfortunately, as good as the action is, it also has some down moments with one fight taking place on a train, and I feel the lack of light takes away from the action a great deal. The plot really isn't all that thin due to another character named Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) being introduced. He's running an outfit that obviously has their own agenda, and this subplot does add to the overall story.

Predator 2 is still pretty heavy with the gore, as the viewer will be treated to brutal kills, and at least one nasty skull and spine moment. The special effects are very good and I also liked the set pieces, where one battle took place in the meat locker of a slaughter house. The amount of lighting seemed just right, as it captured that serious state of panic and confusion during the frenzy. One aspect of the film that suffers from ridiculous criticism happens to be the choice of the hero being Danny Glover. Despite being a better actor than Arnold, some folks had a hard time buying into him as an action hero. I can understand this since he was clearly in the shadow of Mel Gibson during the Lethal Weapon series; but I never really had a problem getting into his character as the cop whom plays by his own rules, and throws up the middle finger to authority. The rest of the cast were pretty decent, however I just couldn't shake how they were nothing but bodies to add to the death count.

The final act was worked out very well, and it was a nice foreshadow to the Alien vs. Predator movie, that the fans were predicting for years and ended up getting in 2004. This segment is also said to what spawned the Alien vs. Predator video game that debut in the early 90's. Overall, I found this to be a really good sequel, and action fans will likely have a bit of fun with it. The movie has 108 minute run time.

Cons: Pretty bland characters",1428537600,,4380,4.46067415730337

this 1990 sequel Predator 2 has been given a new High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen by 20th century fox
and the picture quality does look much sharper & clearer than the old DVD release for sure
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added aswell which does sound much better than the old Dolby digital mix

it doesn't stop there either, all the special features from the 2 Disc DVD set have been carried over which i think is a miracle
usually 20th century fox don't bother making the effort to carry over all the extras when they're reissuing a film on blu-ray
for eg John McTiernan's PREDATOR film first blu-ray release was barebones treatment by 20th century fox
Predator had to be reissued twice on blu-ray for all the special features to be carried over
which is the ULTIMATE HUNTER EDITION

so for this sequel, i think fans are very lucky that all the special features from the 2 Disc DVD have been carried over for sure
THE HUNTERS & THE HUNTED 35min making of featurette
plus the small featurettes, EVOLUTIONS, WEAPONS OF CHOICE, HARD CORE SEGMENTS
the Promo stills Gallery
TV spots, Theatrical trailer
plus the 2 Audio commentary tracks from the DVD release have also been carried over
all this on 1 blu-ray Disc incredible

definitley time to upgrade get this new blu-ray version of Predator 2
5 stars i gave it based on all the extras carried over from the 2 Disc DVD set",1424044800,4,1487,4.558052434456929

384496,5,6301963725,"Predator 2 is a great action packed movie. The movie is well made, well acted, and I liked it much more than the original film. This movie has lots of great scenes, including a horrifying scene in a Subway train where the Predator kills a bunch of people because they are all armed.

One of the things I love about the Predator species in this franchise is that despite the ferocious and terrifying way they kill their prey, Predators never hurt kids, unarmed adults, sick people, and pregnant women. I like that a lot about them. I get so tired of pure evil villains that destroy everything in their path, but the Predators are not like that. They seek only the strongest, and they never hurt innocent people.

The movie features very good performances by Danny Glover, Maria Conchita Alonso, and Bill Paxton. The Predator monster is really cool and scary, and Kevin Peter Hall does a great job playing him. If you love action-horror films, then I highly recommend you watch Predator 2.",1412985600,,987,4.666666666666667

384544,4,6301963725,"PREDATOR 2](1990) is a picture that has so many cast members from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/0790729695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>"" in it I kept expecting to see Mel Gibson do a walk-on at some point. Danny Glover stars as the very Irish-sounding Mike Harrigan (wonder if the lead was intended for Gibson?). Gary Busey, the albino villain ""Joshua"" of ""Lethal Weapon,"" is here head agent of a shadow outfit that's been tracking the alien. Steve Kahan, cousin of Richard Donner who was given the captain's role in ""Weapon,"" appears briefly at the beginning of ""Predator 2.""

Also in the cast: Maria Conchita Alonso (whatever happened to her?), Rubn Blades (ditto?), Bill Paxton as an annoying cop nicknamed ""the Lone Ranger,"" Morton Downey Jr. as an even more abrasive gossip TV show reporter, Adam Baldwin (least of that acting clan) and former&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ADAM-12/dp/B0009UC80Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ADAM-12</a>&nbsp;cop Kent McCord as Glover's boss.

We get the impression that this near-invisible carnivorous alien, played by Kevin Peter Hall, has some sort of conscience, for he seems to know that Ms. Alonso is pregnant and doesn't kill her even though she's in his grasp. BTW, Hall, an African-American actor who died of an AIDS-infected blood transfusion in 1991 at age 36, was also ""Harry"" of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HARRY-AND-THE-HENDERSONS/dp/B000MRNWKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS</a>&nbsp;(1987). The ex-basketballer reprised his role of this lovable Bigfoot monster on a TV series of the same name.

This exciting actioner is set on the streets of a Los Angeles gone mad. We open on a drug war between Jamaicans and Colombians that th4e police are unsuccessfully trying to shut down with their own bullets. The Predator lurks above, watching the violence with his unique infra-red vision. At first he strikes at the bad guys but soon he's killing cops. When Glover's best pal is a victim he vows revenge against something he still doesn't even know exists. When Busey and his hi-tech team show up, Danny also has them to contend with.

The thrills are almost too many and the pace breathlessly gory. The final surpising plot twist suggests there's more ""Predator"" sequels to come, but the picture failed to earn back costs in the U.S. so perhaps the franchise idea was put on hold until 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALIEN-VS-PREDATOR/dp/B000RRS7RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALIEN VS.

384616,4,6301963725,"This sequel begins with a heavy dose of the alien's psychedelic point of view.  However pretty, it does nothing to define the scene.  In this case, we're in LA in the middle of a turf war.  Everyone's shooting; everyone is yelling, everyone is angry and remains so for the bulk of this movie.  The dialog is entirely made up of expletives.  If it's considered a `swear' word, it's in this movie.  Since Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to reprise his role of Dutch, they hired Danny Glover instead (hardly an equable trade off as Glover is far too cumbersome in the role).  The story is alarmingly safe and similar to the original; another alien is hunting and collecting souvenirs of his visit to Earth.  This movie simply trades one jungle for another.  There's also another sneak among the fold in the form of Gary Busey.  Glover's team acts as bait, as the body count mounts.  Later, rather than sooner, it comes down to Glover VS the predator.  With a bigger cast comes more carnage.  Some of the casting is odd to say the least (Morton Downey, Jr. as a loudmouth journalist!).  TV cop Kent McCord plays a cop (how expected).  Adam Baldwin plays a thug (no surprise).  Bill Paxton pops in as a motor-mouth joker (type casting!).  The problem with this sequel is the lack of surprise.  Without the novelty of the original, this one plays like a knockoff.  (I'll give them points for being `green' and recycling practically every element from the first film into this one.)

I like it; I just wish there had been more films in this series.  Why design such a cool alien/monster only to under use it.",1400716800,,1599,4.619217081850533

384690,2,6301963725,"The movie studio's decision to  transfer the action and general storyline of the original Predator film from an exotic locale to ""the big city"" was a poor one indeed. This was a particularly counterintuitive move if we consider that in the original, the jungle itself was the key antagonist, the ever-present threat; ironically made evident in a bit of poetic irony when Anna's makes the statement, ""<the jungle came and took him>."" Its worth noting that the predator creature is finally revealed very late in the film, and really has little screen-time at all when compared to the hero (Schwarzenegger). Speaking of Schwarzenegger, any criticism of his acting abilities aside -especially so early in his Hollywood career -the man does have ample charisma and an obvious screen presence. You genuinely root for him, particularly when the film devolves (in a good way) into a primordial showdown between man and beast. Danny Glover, practically reprising the role of Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon), lacks that charisma entirely and many times I found myself rooting against him. His seemingly incessant ranting throughout the film is intolerable. Moreover, his dispatching of the predator in relatively short order is underwhelming, and ludicrous. As for the rest of his team, Ruben Blades (tolerable) lasts just long enough to become a revenge plot device; Bill Paxton is extremey annoying as the cartoonish ""Lone Ranger,"" and a far cry from the also annoying, but equal parts entertaining Hudson (Aliens); and Maria Conchita Alonzo is seemingly installed to remind us of the ""witty"" banter between Hudson and Vasquez in Aliens... it doesn't... at all. Gary Busey is much to cocky for a scientist with such intimate knowledge of the predator's unique skill set, and even the predator (Kevin Peter Hall) is an emotionless shadow of his former self, that is, when he's not screaming from the injuries he incurs at hands of Glover's Lt. Harrigan. In general, Predator 2 fails to deliver the goods, but does deserve a couple of stars at least for its creature/special effects which are a tad improved from what we saw in Predator.",1393113600,2,2120,5.091954022988506

384762,4,6301963725,"The first film is a hard act to follow and while the sequel doesn't quite hit the same mark, it is a decent sequel. This time the action moves the LA in the midst of a heat wave and all out gang war. Instead of Arnie and his crack team of soldiers we have Danny Glover as an over the top cop and his elite squad.

The first problem for me is that in the first film while it ended up with Arnie on his own, for the most part he was part of a team that all carried their wait. The interaction between them was also more interesting than it is in the sequel. Rather than leading and being part of a team it feels like Danny Glover is a lone maverick that just so happens to have a few people tagging along.

The other issue is the location, while it could have been an excellent setting for tangling with a Predator, it's not really utilised to it's full advantage, mostly because it doesn't build the same tension as the first film.

So far I've only compared it negatively to the original, but in fairness it does have a few things going for it. Danny Glover does do the cop on the edge thing very well and it does work in the context. You do get the feeling that he's managing to keep going by sheer balls. It also has Gary Busey, who is always a fun addition to any film. For the majority of his role he actually manages to be fairly reasonable, but his true colours are revealed by the end :-)

The other aspect I enjoyed was the small glimpses of the Predator's culture, the skulls on his trophy board were pretty cool and he has some new toys to play with. All in all it's a decent action film that provides an entertaining watch.",1388880000,,1634,4.112852664576803

Luckily Predator 2 only suffers from the latter. Not picking up Arnie's contract was a huge mistake, he was the heartbeat of the first film.

Adding Danny Glover could have been a good move but he needed a better supporting cast (not Mel Gibson). The whole plot line with the gangsters in a not too distant Los Angeles was extremely lame, but if you love the first Predator you've probably seen this movie and you also probably know what I'm saying here.",1388102400,,599,4.348214285714286

Alan Silvestri's mind-blowing score from Predator 1 is improved on the 0-10 scale by 11. Stephen Hopkins' direction is excellent and gives P2 a very special and hard-worked feel to it. The Cinematography is awesome and makes the film scary and unpredictable. The action sequences are also Grade A+. The breath-taking shootout at the beginning, the Train confrontation, and the final Battle. Wow! P2 combines the intense action of P1 and amps it up to eleven. The action sequences are even more though-out and better than those of P1. The acting is brilliant too. Danny Glover makes a great Hero as Harrigan and has one of his best roles ever. He makes Harrigan a likeable character that you'll root for all the way too the end. The level of violence and gore is also a LOT higher than the original's and any gore-hound will be in Heaven with this. I also must say that P2's settings and story are brilliant to the max. A crime- infested Los Angeles was the perfect spot for him to continue his Rampage and all of the sets, from the Meat Factory, Predator Ship and ""shot-out"" Buildings are mind-blowing. Predator 2 is all in all an excellent Grade A+ sequel that pretty much improves over the original Predator. I REALLY hope this review will give this underrated masterpiece a much better reputation.

384850,4,6301963725,"I think the original Predator was ground breaking. It was set in a tropical jungle involving tough military macho guys who couldn't match up to the invisible predator, except for one. But a sequel is always tougher because we already know the creature and what it is capable of and what its purpose is. To go back to the jungle would be too much of a copy cat idea. So moving the setting to the city and having the Predator hunt the human predators in the city was a good idea, but the problem is that most sequels involve at least the lead from the first movie. The second movie had an all new cast and none of them was Arnold so there was a disconnect there. I didn't like the movie the first time I saw it, but giving it some time and letting Arnold go, I was able to appreciate what they did with the second movie on its own merits. I loved the humor when the cop enters the predator spaceship and there is an Alien skull as a souvenir on the wall.

It is fun for a night when thinking sensibly and seriously, or watching something that reminds one of the real world, is not what you need. Pure Escapism is the order of the day.
Danny Glover, Gary Busey and company, deal professionally with their tasks, using standard techniques they learned in Acting 101: How to deal with Monsters in a  picture.

384908,4,6301963725,"WARNING! THIS MOVIE CONTAINS SCENES THAT MAY INDUCE SEIZURES IN PEOPLE WITH PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY!

I felt the need to preface the review proper with that, as neither the DVD, nor Amazon give any indication of this. As far as the film itself goes, Predator 2 can best be described as one part Predator, one part Robocop, one part Death Wish 3, and just a splash of Highlander (After claiming a trophy from Bill Paxton, the Predator has a Quickening). For some, this might seem completely stupid; others will see a kind of demented genius in it.

Much like Robocop, the film satirizes the depiction of violence in the media, here done through a series of news reports called Hard Core. This program seems to run in an alternate universe version of 1997, where a reported can show several skinned bodies and advocate the murder of criminals on live TV. This is a failing of the film, as while Robocop took place in a desensitized dystopian future, Predator 2 is set firmly in the decade it was made.

However, Predator 2 has one thing over Robocop; it's committed to it's message. Robocop satirized the rising levels of sex and violence in pop culture by depicting both in a comically overblown fashion; having its cake and eating it too. Predator 2, while still fully deserving it's R rating, is notably less graphic in its violence than the first, and because of that the condemning of graphic violent content rings more true.

Many people complain about the city setting, saying that it robs the film of a connection to the original. I respectfully disagree, as the ""concrete jungle"" of Los Angeles offers many of the things that helped make Predator intense; lots of high places and blind corners for the Predator to hide, and other dangers besides the Predator for the characters to worry about. This keeps the same spirit of the first, while giving the sequel it's own identity, rather than making it feel so similar you wonder why it exists.

The film's only real crime is not being as memorable as the first, but the bar was set very high in that regard. In short, most fans of the first will probably find Predator 2 a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi/horror movie, and a worthy successor to the Schwarzenegger classic.",1370390400,3,2226,4.741602067183463

384982,3,6301963725,"The previous film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger left a lot of questions unanswered. The sequel is set in Los Angeles and the film starts with the shooting between drug cartel groups and L.A.P.D. officers just like one of the scenes in Lethal Weapon series. While they are trying to find out what had happened after the bloody murders they are stopped by Federal Agents who are working on their agenda. Then the story turns up like a part of X-files. Special Agent Peter Keys is a Cigarette Smoking Man of this government cover-up mystery. Later it was found out that unidentified invisible monsters are actually warriors from another planet and has their own code of rules such as not attacking people unarmed. And the latter part of movie suggests that these creatures involved in historical battles such as Iwo Jima or Colonial days battles. What I was frustrated is not the film itself. The way the series left us in the dark. It is like ending the series in Back To The Future part 2 and left mysteries unsolved. I hope recent film Predators can answer some of the mysteries.

There is still a lot of dirt and grit from the original print that shows through the transfer, and the overall definition is a little flat but I actually think this is somewhat due to the source content.  Colors and contrast are quite nice though, and there is no significant enhancements or digital noise corrections present which can really detract.  I highly doubt that this film will get a reboot with a better transfer, so this is probably the best it is ever going to look.

Lieutenant Mike Harrigan of the LAPD is caught right in the middle, but he and his team are about to receive help from the most unlikely of allies: an alien Predator that has chosen LA as his new hunting ground! Conceptually, PREDATOR 2 is the perfect sequel. It does not attempt to recreate the first film, but rather moves the setting to the next logical location: The concrete jungles of LA. The Thomas Brothers turn in another action-packed script that attempts to outdo the original at every turn. There is more blood, more violence, and more gadgets as this sleek new urban Predator sets out to collect his human trophies using metal shurikens, razorwire nets, and spears. The redesigned costume and differing attack patterns show us that the Predator race is as varied and diverse as our own, which leads up to a shocking finale aboard the Predator spacecraft. Danny Glover offers a welcomed change of pace from Arnold and the gang, playing a breakneck cop with no regard for authority. For all of the awesome action sequences and gory murders, however, the story itself is often contrived, and conveniently places the Predator in all the right places at all the right times. PREDATOR 2 comes as close as any sequel could to reproducing the thrills and non-stop action of the original, while giving us something new entirely.

385068,3,6301963725,"When you have any movie as awesome as ""Predator,"" a sequel is bound to be a disappointment. This is doubly true if you set it in Los Angeles, with a side helping of ""shadowy government agency.""

So it's fairly obvious what is wrong from the start with ""Predator 2,"" which takes the primal hunter-and-hunted struggle out of the primal jungle, and sticks it right in the middle of a late-80s city. It's not a horrible film -- especially since it has Danny Glover -- but it doesn't have the viscerally fascinating quality of the first movie.

The Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs are currently in a massive war for Los Angeles, and the police seem to be helpless to stop them. But when several Jamaicans are brutally killed when they are murdering the Colombian drug lord, Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) sees a rippling, invisible shape -- and finds a mysterious weapon made out of an unknown element.

It turns out that an extraterrestrial Predator is hunting the gangs of L.A. -- and occasionally the cops too. And in turn, the Predator is being hunted by a covert government agency who want the scientific secrets that his technology may give them. But naturally, the conflict boils down to a battle between the deadly alien and the never-say-die Harrigan.

One of the best things about ""Predator"" is that it was a visceral, primal movie -- sweaty desperate people in the jungle, trying to escape/fight an unknown foe who can skin you alive. It's also very timeless, since the conflict could be easily transferred anywhere in the world, with any gang of hardened warriors.

""Predator 2""... does not have this feeling. It's very urban, very 80s/90s, very cop-movie. Now, it's not a terrible movie -- it has some nice gritty action scenes, and director Stephen Hopkins slips in some truly awesome horror moments (like the Predator carrying off the Jamaican drug-lord's head).  However, it's a little too... civilized at times, with too much police politics and too big a cast.

And while the shadowy government agency seeking to capture the Predator is a realistic twist, it feels a little too X-Filesian. It would have been awesome if there had been a real fight between the Predators and the government slime, but the agency just doesn't really factor in very much.

BUT... Danny Glover is staggeringly awesome as Harrigan. He's a normal cop who is fiery, uncompromising, tough and he never gives up no matter what -- he feels very much like a real guy. Glover's performance alone raises this movie above mediocrity, and Mar&iacute;a Conchita Alonso gives a good performance -- although Morton Downey Jr. and Bill Paxton are intensely annoying.

""Predator 2"" doesn't live up to the primal jungle suspense of the first movie, but it's worth watching for some nice gory moments and Danny Glover.",1332547200,2,2806,4.890526315789474

While it lacked the tension of the first film, it did provide an original story with a new location and with as much of an engaging alien hunter as the first, straying far from ""pale clone of its predecessor"". Sadly, the same can't be said for other entries in the franchise, though Predators does certainly rank higher than Aliens Vs. Predator ever could imagine. Predator 2 was a blast. It may be missing Arnold, but once you get into the movie, you'll be glad that they didn't resort to his star power for the sake of supercharging this sequel, which did not need it.",1320537600,2,748,4.35

385125,3,6301963725,"The only reason for films like this to exist is for the action sequences and special effects.  I remember when I saw the original `Predator' film.  It was exciting and thrilling and even for an 80's film, the special effects were phenomenal.  The effects and loud, bombastic action sequences don't disappoint here, but where the original film's spotty script was actually aided by the mystery of it all, this sequel is held back by lack of detail and the overall predictable nature of the set up.  Half of the fun of the original was that the jungle antics were out of the norm and that the questionable nature of the Predator's earthly hunting gave way to sudden fear and tingles in the spine.  With this installment the obvious hero has been replaced by Danny Glover, who is an ample actor but hardly an action star of Arnold's caliber (better actor, lesser hero), and the script is given a futuristic (but not too much so) setting in a more familiar setting, Los Angeles.  The film is not bad, but it isn't good either.  If you want a brainless romp through the city, then this will strike your fancy, but if you want something that feels a little more authentic and grounded in its genre then watch the original.  Sure, the original film isn't a masterpiece, but it is a classic piece of science fiction; which this is not.",1315267200,,1327,4.569620253164557

385127,3,6301963725,"Predator 2 (1990) transplants the formidable alien from the jungle, to the crime riddled streets of Los Angeles.  The setting isn't the only change, as the tone of the sequel is less serious and edgy, and has more of a comedic element.  The film features Danny Glover as LAPD detective Lt. Mike Harrigan, who is part of a team trying to keep a lid on a turf war between rival drug gangs, where gun battles in the street are common.  The conflict has drawn the interest of a Predator, who takes out some gang members during an encounter with the cops.

The Predator strikes again, slaughtering more criminals then displaying his naked trophy kills in dramatic fashion.  When Harrigan tries to investigate, he is banned from the crime scene by federal agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), who is heading a government operation, secretly on the trail of the Predator.  When Harrigan's group continues to investigate, team members Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), and Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso) all become casualties.  After an attack in a subway, Harrigan chases the creature as he travels across the rooftops.  He encounters Keyes' operation as they are about to spring a trap on the Predator, and discovers that he has been tangling with an alien.

Harrigan enters the meat packing plant, where Keyes and his team are preparing to ambush the creature, and soon finds himself battling the alien alone.  He injures the creature, who crashes into a nearby apartment building.  After a short break in the hostilities, Harrigan and the Predator have a battle to the death in a subterranean cavern below the building.

In step with many action films at the time, Predator 2 is big, loud, and violent, with an unsophisticated plot, and cartoonish characters.  Being a sequel, much of the suspense is gone, so the plan is to turn the alien loose, limit his prey mostly to cops and criminals, and then feature as much violence and destruction as possible.  The approach works, and Predator 2 certainly has some exciting moments, particularly in the third act, where after being behind the curve for most movie, Harrigan finally gets on the frontline of battle.  He acquits himself well, but the finish in a subterranean alien ship, is weak and ridiculous, with very subpar CG special effects for the Predators.

Although the film has a different tone, and lacks much of the feeling of suspense of the original, Predator 2 does deliver plenty of mayhem.  It's not a classic in the genre like its predecessor, but it entertains, and Stephen Hopkins (The Ghost And The Darkness) proves himself directing an action film.  Danny Glover doesn't have the smoothest moves, is bothered by birds, and isn't very convincing delivering corny one-liners, but he makes a competent, if slightly gangly action hero.  Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger, but then who is?  While Schwarzenegger declined to reprise his role as Dutch for Predator 2, Alan Silvestri returns to do the music, which does provide a much needed edge to the film.",1302048000,,3045,4.933333333333334

He goes around accidentally helping the police by killing the voodoo mafia. Why is he killing them? It's never explained as to why Predator is going after the voodoo people. I thought maybe they had killed or captured one of Predator's buddys or something but no they did nothing. Predator's just a racist.
So Predator goes around comittin genocide and eventually kills someone whose not black which turns out to be Danny Glovers partner. Danny Glover wants revenge and goes after Preds. But why was Predator in the city killing drug dealers to begin with!?

Anyway the movies sorta fun to watch and it has alot of great 90s dumbness added in.

385190,5,6301963725,"After it first came out critics and fans of the first film alike trashed this film, and personally I don't see why.  While it may take some things from the first film (it is a sequel after all), it doesn't overly do so like Predators does.  For starters it doesn't tease us with the Predator.  Right off the bat we see from the hunter's view as he watches humans fight in the streets, eventually selecting a main target in Lt. Mike Harrigan (played by Danny Glover).  The predator also has some new toys, like the smartdisk, spear and netgun. The film also explains the Predator honor code a little more than the first film, which only showed they will fight on even terms with prey they consider to worthy, as well as fight armed opponents for the most part.
A lot of people criticize Glover's casting in an action film as the lead, saying he can't pull it off.  I disaggree with that.  For starters do people forget Glover was in the Lethal Weapon films, in which he is involved in action scenes that involve gunplay.  After recently watching those films I buy Glover in an action role even more than I did before.  Granted he's not the same size as Arnold, but he's not supposed to be.  He's a cop, not a soldier.

As for the special features on the dvd, they're ok.  The documentary was very well done, but I wish they could have put on some deleted scenes (which I know for a fact exist; a whole subplot involving the female cop's pregnancy was all but cut out of the final film).  There's also two featuretes from when the film was being made, but they were on the bare bones dvd.

Nice new weapons for predator, which helped next generation movies like (avp) and comic books.
There was some good acting here and there like (Bill Paxton: ""Gameover man"", from the best alien film aliens), and Danny Glover and Peter Kevin Hall.
Ok now for negative.
The movie being put in the city was a problem.
There was some unnecessary nudity. I mean the predator drum theme is heard after the Lieutenant and the long ranger are speaking and then there is a quick sex scene, which seems like it just tagged along. I was disappointed the story didn't just continue with (Arnold Schwarznegger), but in another jungle, or a desert which would of been new. There were soo many debates on whether if (Elpida Carrillo) would even return, but she didn't even act in the movie. This would of been not too bad to put the movie in the city if we had more better actors, and a much better storyline.

385220,3,6301963725,"A sequel should do at least two things: 1) respect the established world of the previous installment(s) and 2) contribute to the mythology.  Aliens is the obvious example of a film that accomplished both these requirements.  The film manages to expand the scope of the original by introducing the space marines and giving us a glimpse of the alien hierarchy while simultaneously exploring themes from the first film, including an interrogation of feminism, rape and the military industrial complex.  Predator 2 is no Aliens.  However, I am happy to say that for a film that has a bad reputation, this sequel to the Schwarzenegger classic holds up surprisingly well.  At the very least, the movie does respect the rules honed in the first film, even if it never manages to truly justify its own existence.

 Predator 2's simple twist on the formula of the first film is that the predator is now in the city.  In a clever opening shot, the camera pans along tropical looking flora until we see the skyline of Los Angeles.  Supposedly, it was this new setting that turned Schwarzenegger off the project.  Normally, when a principal actor turns down a role for the sequel (think Batman Forever and Batman and Robin) this indicates a deeply flawed shift in the series, but in this case Schwarzenegger isn't missed.  The strength of the first movie was the ensemble nature of the cast, not just the central protagonist, and the writers would have been forced to come up with something pretty outlandish in order to keep all the characters from the Predator in the sequel.  (Although, Voodoo does play a key part of Predator 2, which likely means we were extremely close to a Predator versus Zombies movie.  Hollywood, if you're listening, I would love to see Predator tangle with a Zombie Blain).

 This time, instead of the Governator, Danny Glover steps up as the man who must hunt the hunter.  And while he may not have the `roided up muscles of Schwarzenegger, he brings an everyman quality to his character that grounds the more ostentatious sci-fi moments of the film.  Glover plays Mike Harrigan, a police officer caught in the middle of the sweltering urban heat and an escalating gang war between Columbians and Voodoo practicing Jamaicans (Voodoo is mostly practiced among Haitians, but okay, I'll bite).  We are first introduced to Harrigan when he storms into a firefight between the police and a Columbian gang in order to save two downed officers.  Draping two bullet proof vests over a car window, he places himself between the gang members and the wounded police and then manages to outflank several of the whooping and hollering Columbians.  The rest of the gang take refuge in a high rise, but when Harrigan and his team attempt to flush them out, instead of entering into another firefight, he finds almost the entire gang slaughtered with their blood and body parts strewn across walls and floors.

 Not only must Harrigan deal with a mysterious newcomer on the streets of LA, but he also must struggle with an unknown federal agency that wants to hobble Harrigan's freewheeling attitude.  Shortly after his heroics with the Columbian gang, Harrigan finds himself dressed down by Agent Keyes (Gary Busey) who tells him to play start playing by the rules.  In a subplot borrowed from the Alien films, it turns out Keyes belongs to a government agency (that is eerily similar to the same organization shown in the film Repo Man) entrusted with capturing the predator and, more importantly, his technology.  Oh, and Harrigan's team been assigned a new, unproven member, Jerry, played to an obnoxious hilt by Bill Paxton.  The film devotes most of its time to Harrigan and his team's investigation into the predator and how their attempts to piece together who it is that has the gall to murder the most vicious of L.A.'s gangs, as well as more than a few cops.

 Predator 2 keenly follows the formula and rules established in the first film.  Fans of the original film will likely remember the female prisoner's monologue about the predator's predilection for extreme tropical climates, specifically stating that the creature would appear only during the hottest of summers (this is a part of the film that the makers of Alien Vs. Predator apparently forgot).  In the sequel, the director has several characters make note of the asphalt melting heat and their uniforms are blotted with sweat stains, a nice allusion to the first film that respects the audience enough to let them make the connection.  While the look of the predator stays true to the delineation of the first film, Stan Winston has tweaked the predator design for this film, providing this creature with crowded dreadlocks, an elongated skull and the reptilian designs of a copperhead snake.  Towards the end of the film, we are treated with half a dozen or so different predators that both conform to the outlines of the alien from the first film and present a unique take on what a predator can look like.

 Furthermore, the predator's modus operandi isn't much different, which turns out to be both a strength and a weakness.  Once again, he searches for warriors, kills them and smuggles some trophies.  This time, however, the predator eschews subtly for wholesale slaughter.  Instead of picking enemies off one by one, he prefers to jump into the middle of a group and takes them out en mass.  The brash tactics are never explained.  Perhaps he's a much younger predator, used to eating everything in the cookie jar rather than savoring them one by one.  Age has a way of making you appreciate a kill.  Unfortunately, this tactic makes the predator far less interesting.  The first film formed a battle of wits between the predator and the mercenaries, but here the gangs and cops are completely outclassed.  If he came to Earth to hunt game, then it hardly seems like a sport--kind of like Dick Cheney driving around in an SUV in order to shoot quails and his friend's face.  If there's no effort then it's no fun.

 The director does manage to add his own stylized take on the urban predator.  There is one particular scene that provides a glimpse of what the film could have been.  The predator follows Harrigan to his meeting with King Willie, the leader of the Jamaican Voodoo gang.  After Harrigan leaves, the predator plunges from the rooftops and into the alleyway.  In a close shot we follow the invisible footsteps of the predator as he approaches King Willie who then brandishes two knives.  We cut to an image of his face screaming, which, as the visage moves farther away, is revealed to be a decapitated head in the grasp of the predator.  The filmmaker makes use of the indeterminate temporal nature of the cut--that we are never certain how much time has passed when a cut occurs--and what we expect to be an image from the middle of an intense brawl reveals itself as an easy kill for the predator.

 It's the filmmaker's attempts to broaden the mythology where the film ultimately fails.  This time around the predator has some new toys, including a boomerang death discus, a piano wire net and a double sided harpoon, and while the weaponry is fun, it adds little to the overall predator mythos.  The filmmakers make another attempt at expanding the universe at the end of the film when Harrigan stumbles into the predator ship and notices a trophy display, containing, most famously, the head of an alien from that other franchise.  When he finally kills the predator, one of the creature's brethren hands Harrigan an 18th century pistol, suggesting that humans have served as game for the predators for centuries.  But the fact that the predators have returned to Earth again and again was already established in the first film.  We do discover more about the predator's ethos when he refuses to kill Harrigan's female companion because she's with child, revealing that the predators are pro-life.  This, of course, begs the question as to whether or not the predator has a Jesus fish on the back of his spaceship.

Perhaps the most mystifying change to the formula of the first film was the decision to make it take place in the future (or the past depending on whether you start from when I'm writing or when the film was made).  Predator 2 takes place in 1997, a whole seven years from when it was made.  Of course, it is a 1997 that looks strangely like 1990, but with weirder looking guns and police cars that look like hybrid mini-vans.  The futuristic setting only serves to make the movie look older than it really is.

If the film only relied on momentum from the first film with a few new details, then I think it would have a much stronger reputation, but there are unfortunate performances throughout the movie.  Bill Paxton, who has turned in strong roles before, is at his guffawing worst.  The gangs are mostly cartoonish and are one step removed from Looney Tunes characters.  That is, if Bugs Bunny often left mounds of coke lying around and, instead of replacing Rabbit Season signs with Duck Season signs, decided to ritualistically murder Daffy Duck.  Shockingly, Gary Busey, who has transformed into a living breathing cartoon character himself, gives a nuanced performance by the standards of the film.

Predator 2 is a mixed bag of some old standbys and half formed ideas.  It may not deserve the awful reputation it has garnered over the years, but it is far from the classic of the first.  If you haven't seen the film in a long time, I would recommend a second visit.  You might be surprised at how entertaining the film still is.",1278201600,,9561,4.785975609756098

In the first film, Predator was being hunted in the jungle by the Godfather of Soundboard and Chink Webber with a side of Jessie the body. This one, not as much.

This time, Predator turns up in a different kind of jungle, L.A. Fantastic. While the first installment does not qualify as B, this one does. Apache was the main character for the first 15 minutes if the flick.  Now, Sid knows you're saying to yourself, ""Wait. I thought Apache got blown up by Arnold in the original?"" Well, you're right.

The place where the Predator resides . . . and is willing to find a few more people to add in his trophy collection. To be quite honest, I slightly prefer this to the original Predator film. The mains reasons are that the main antagonist is given a more thorough background. We get to see how he hunts and how he chooses his victims. We also get to see more weapons (such as the awe-inspiring circular blade). Also, I think that Danny Glover as Harrigan is a far more convincing character than Arnold as Dutch. He's not as muscular as Dutch, but he's equal when it comes to intelligence. His ongoing confrontations with the Predator are, in some ways, more epic (who can forget the final battle near the end of the film?). There is as much blood and gore as in the original, but it seems far more disturbing when taken a look at. The music is pretty much the same, but it's still able to blend in the entire movie despite the different environments.

Danny Glover (Harrigan), the rogue cop (remember Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon?) is mis-cast in this strange, goofy sequel to the original (the original, being far superior to this offering). And in fact, acts like the Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon. Maybe, they should have asked Mel Gibson to play his side-kick in this one. Nahhhhhh..... wouldn't have made a difference.

Reuben Blades (Danny) and Bill Paxton (Lambert), who play the other cops in Glover's ""team"" get their turns being gutted by the Predator.

Opinion: Predator 2 is an action packed ride with a few flaws. The only person you get to know is the hot-headed Harrigan. Everybody else in the movie comes and goes. Danny's anger is over the top sometimes. But the the storyline is decent and Harrigan stood his ground and fought Predator to a standstill like Dutch did without getting a royal buttkicking like Dutch got.

Stephen Hopkin's direction, while not on par with McTiernan's, is intense and exciting enough to keep the viewer interested.  Unfortunately, the script by the Thomas Brothers is...terrible.  Not as terrible as AvP Requiem's, but bad enough to induce some cringing at the dialogue.  Danny Glover gives a decent performance as the unlikely hero, Lt. Harrigan, but everyone else is just reading off of note cards (not that they had much to work with anyway).  Many of the characters, like Tony Pope and Jerry Lambert, are just plain dumb and obnoxious.

Thankfully, the effects work by Stan Winston, is, as usual, fantastic.  The Predator itself looks great, and Kevin Peter Hall gives a very different performance from the first film.

When Harrigan finally defeats it using its own weapons, you can't help but applaud.

385352,5,6301963725,"3 years after ""Predator"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger wowed audiences worldwide, 20th Century Fox had high hopes for even more box office success when they released ""Predator 2"". But this sequel wasn't without a major problem at first, when the film was to begin shooting, Arnold was busy filming ""Total Recall"" and unable to return for the sequel, leaving the creative team with a starring role that needed filling; instead of choosing yet another hulking muscle man to fill Arnold's shoes, Fox went with veteran actor Danny Glover who was having great success alongside Mel Gibson in the `Lethal Weapon' series. With a new actor in the lead role, a different director behind the camera, and a different type of story and location, would ""Predator 2"" find great success with audiences or would this be one hunt that was doomed to failure from the beginning?

""Predator 2"" takes place in the year 1997, in Los Angeles during the middle of an intense heat and crime wave that is sweeping the city. While the people cope with the heat, the cops of the city are fighting a very deadly war on crime, but the fighting is getting a little easier. Because something is killing the drug dealers that are running L.A.; however, no one knows what the killer looks like. The cops are opting to simply let the drug dealers get wiped out by this unseen assassin, but Lt. Harrigan (Danny Glover) feels that there is something far worse than your average killer behind these murders, and when he comes face to face with this killer, he'll soon find out what it's like to be the predator's prey.

When Arnold had to pass on filming the sequel to ""Predator"", generally a sign of bad things to come for the movie, it was a surprise that Fox went away from the action hero type of actor to play the lead. Going against what logic would dictate, at least what would stand for logic in Hollywood (basically the `keep using what worked before' mentality), 20th Century Fox brought in Danny Glover (not exactly an action guy) to go one-on-one with the galaxy's fiercest hunter. To my surprise, and probably to most people as well, Glover functioned surprisingly well in this type of role, and delivered a very believable performance, especially in the action scenes with the predator. The main supporting cast consisting of Gary Busey and Bill Paxton were equally memorable in their roles; Busey as the government agent whose intention is to capture the predator no matter the cost, and Paxton as a newly transferred cop who loves nothing more than seeing action on the streets. All of the actors really delivered strong performances, which was nice to see in this type of movie. Having the actors actually take the material seriously even though it is science-fiction raised the quality of this movie up beyond your typical monster movie fare.

The story for the movie was well paced with plenty of plot developments keeping things moving, not just seeming like just a bunch of talk simply to fill in the time between action scenes. I enjoyed the change of location from your average jungle to the urban jungle of Los Angeles, giving the predator a different environment to adapt to and new prey to hunt. The story also explored some of the code of conduct for the predators, which was interesting; such as, they won't harm unarmed people, they won't kill pregnant women, and if they are beaten they will take their own life. It was nice to see that the creators of this franchise wanted the fans to gain more of an understanding of what these predators are and why they do what they do, so I'm glad they brought those elements into the story, to give them more character rather than being just bloodthirsty killers.

As was the case with the first film, and that of the `Alien' franchise, great kudos must be given to the costumes department, in particular Stan Winston's work on the predator suit. 20th Century Fox must have really wanted to make the predators into iconic monsters of modern cinema, because the creatures were given much more screen time in this film than they were in the first one. Clearly the choice to give more screen time to the predator paid off, since they have successfully joined the ranks of being one of Hollywood's greatest movie monsters/villains of all time, serving as a testament to the great work that Stan Winston and his team put into this creature's development.

Two interesting side notes regarding ""Predator 2"": one, at the end of the film when the defeated predator kills himself and Lt. Harrigan is left on the ship by himself, when he looks in the trophy case you see a skull of a xenomorph or `alien' from the `Alien' franchise planting the seeds for the inevitable showdown seen in ""AVP: Alien Vs Predator"". Two, actor Bill Paxton has been killed on screen by 3 of the biggest villains/monsters in movie history, and they are as follows: the Terminator (""The Terminator""), an alien (""Aliens""), and a predator (""Predator 2""). Just thought I'd share that useless bit of information with you all, so now you've learned something.

""Predator 2"" managed to deliver to audiences an exciting thrill ride that fully equals the original film on every level, and to some may even be better than the original simply because you get to see more of the predator this time around, and the action is kicked up very early on. A definite must see for fans of the first film, the `Alien' franchise, or just action/monster movie fans in general.

385354,4,6301963725,"Skipping past my silly title, I actually liked this movie over Arnold Schwarzenegger's first ""Predator."" While Arnold has an incredible physique, Danny Glover is more down-to-earth and has to rely on his wits more than Arnold had to.

Danny Glover plays a maverick cop in the vein of Harry Callahan in Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies. As Danny hunts down Columbian drug lords he runs across an alien predator also hunting the same Columbian drug lords. While Danny should be happy that someone else is taking out Columbian drug lords, apparently Danny would rather it be the police instead of an alien hunter, so soon Danny finds himself on the trail of the alien.

The original ""Predator"" had a number of plot holes that were easy to ignore because of the nearly non-stop action. ""Predator 2"" has even more plot holes, and occasionally they intrude into the action enough that you have to pay attention to them. Perhaps the biggest plot hole is the arrogance and stupidity of Gary Bussey as government agent Peter Keyes. It seems that in action movies the feds always end up being portrayed as too good for everyone's own good, including their own. If Gary and his team were as technologically astute as they appeared to be, they should have recognized that the alien could see their lights in the meat locker. While that particular incident may have been the biggest plot hole, there are a number of others that are occasionally distracting that I will leave for the viewer to discover.

The real charm of this movie is that Danny is physically not a match for the predator, and thus must rely on his intelligence to thwart the predator. The predator clearly has its own arrogance, for which it ultimately pays, but along the way the interaction between Glover and the alien provide for some very good scenes.

In one scene the predator has Danny Glover in a very bad situation. Danny is able to make use of the alien's high tech boomerang weapon to cut off the alien's hand. The alien escapes into a building across the way. By using a cool looking colander the alien mixes a little glass and some other ingredients to make a kind of patch for the stub of his arm. The noise the alien makes as it puts the molten glass and ceramic on its arm scares a little old lady in her bed, providing for a funny moment as the alien leaps out of the lady's bathroom and then her apartment, soon followed by Danny Glover, who has in the meantime found a clever way to get between the two apartment buildings.

""Predator 2"" is not quite as slick as the first ""Predator,"" and the plot holes are bigger. For all that, I thought ""Predator 2"" achieved more of the potential of the alien hunter than the first movie, and the action was more frequent and more varied than in the first movie. As with the first movie the final show down is between the main character and the alien, and the outcome is just about as uncertain. While each movie has its charms and its weaknesses, and I am sure some prefer the first over the second, I still think the second has a lot to offer.

Note that there are a bunch of versions of this movie. Be sure to choose the version that best meets your needs and budget.

385356,5,6301963725,"Opening with the gang war between the Columbians and the Jamaicans in downtown L.A., you know that this movie is way different from the first movie that took place in the rain forests of Central America. But one thing's for sure, this movie is going to have action.

This movie takes place in the year 1997, which is now in our past but then future since it was made in 1990. Even with that said, this movie gives a good look at our possible future. The pollution has really caused the Green House Effect to become a bigger problem as they sweat constantly on this movie. This is just the right environment for a Yatja, better known as a Predator, since they love humid/hot environments. That is why they are in Central America.

Danny Glover (who plays Lieutenant Mike Harrigan in the movie) does an excellent action job. He's no Ahnold, but he is still very good. But the film really goes to Bill Paxton who plays Jerry Lambert, the new cop trying to prove himself as a good cop in the roughest parts of L.A. He brings his sassy, take no for an answer attitude; that was last scene in Aliens to this movie, which works. He actually becomes the anti-hero. Gotta love Kevin Peter Hall who once again portrayed the Predator, which he does the role even better in this film.

This movie is very underrated. There are many great things about this movie to love. To the simplest, the story. A cop trying to turn his war zone into a livable city again. The last thing he needed was this alien threat. The story handles itself very well with lots of needed action, but this movie is not as gory as the first.

The best thing about the Predator is that he is more detail. He looks a lot better than he did in the first movie, and the movement is much more tribal, all praise goes to Kevin who studied African tribes so he could master being the Predator, and it really shows in this film. The Predator's weapons are fantastic. You really do get to see the Predator's arsenal in this film. He has a disc that cuts all that comes in contact with it then returns to the alien's hand automatically. The net that pins you to the ground then gets tighter until you are sliced into pieces. And the staff, which can become a smaller size, excellent weapon indeed.

Now to the best scenes in the film. This film has many. Not including the action packed, opening 10 minute gang war at the beginning of the film, this movie has a lot of awesome scene involving the Predator. Mainly the subway scene. This is the big scene of the movie. Gang members are pestering the people on the sub, only to discover when they pull out their guns that everyone on the sub has one as well. Knowing this, the Predator tears the roof off of the sub car and begins to kill everyone; a real bloodbath except you can't really see it because the lights in the train are fading in and out. It's a real suspenseful scene. Everyone screaming with every now and then flickers of people scene being killed. I love it. This is my favorite scene in the entire movie.

There is another scene when the people trying to capture the Predator try to trap him by luring him to a warehouse full of beef. They also go in the warehouse wearing suits so the Predator can't see the heat off of their bodies, because that's the way the Predator can see his prey. Don't want to say what happens, but let's just say it doesn't go as planned.

Then there is the fight scene with Danny and the Predator. It goes from the top of the roof, to busting into grandma's bathroom which is hilarious! The grandma is standing outside of her bathroom listening to the Predator inside. She can hear the growling and says, ""Honey, I think there is someone in the bathroom."" All of the sudden she grabs a broom to hit whoever is inside but before that happens the Predator busts through the door and scares her. He then runs into the halls of the apartments. Then Danny is chasing him, so he comes through the bathroom as well. Scaring the woman again. He says ""Don't worry, I'm a cop"". She says, ""I don't think he gives an s***."" This is the funniest thing I've seen in a while. It's hilarious!

Then there is the scene with King Willie, the voodoo gang leader, when he fights the Predator. Let's just say, it's a scream!

Finally, the last scene I will mention with out spoiling the entire movie for ya, there is a scene where they going into the Colombian gang leaders room to find skinned bodies everywhere, awesome.

Overall, I say that this movie is awesome, not as good as the first, but pretty darn close",1139875200,8,4538,4.38525564803805

385408,5,6301963725,"In 1987, one of history's greatest movie monsters hit the screen: an extraterrestrial known as The Predator. The vicious alien warrior dropped in for some slaughter among the South American jungles, ultimately facing off with Arnold ""Terminator"" Schwarzenegger in what now has become a classic. But in 1990, The Predator hit the screen again in search of more slaughter, and found his game in the rough-n-wild habitat of Los Angeles, California. Too many times, sequels to great films have been disappointing. But bloody hell, Predator 2 could not have been better!

Danny Glover plays the driven cop, Mike Harrigan, in the middle of a town seemingly run by criminals. To make his job even harder, a new killer has come to play in the grim city, and this thing isn't human. It kills as it pleases, collecting the skulls of it's victims. It's equipped with dozens of out-of-this-world gadgets, including a cloaking device, laser blasters, a wicked spear, and more. It's a hunter of the worst kind, and it seems absolutely unstoppable. To make matters worse, there is a group of reseachers that don't want to defeat the creature, but rather capture it and learn from it. They try, of course, but you can predict the outcome. Whether he likes it or not, Harrigan seems to be the only one capable of stopping the monster. The enemy realizes this, and all hell breaks loose. It becomes a battle between the vigilante cop and the terrifying creature, right down to the very end where they face-off in the predator's spaceship!

Don't worry about cheesiness here. Just as the first one, Predator 2 succeeds in a terrifying roller coaster ride of realistic monster mayhem, packed full of action. Even a concept such as a fight scene in a spaceship (which, upon reading it, would sound silly) keeps the tense mood, refusing to let your mind drift from the horrific world of this man and his other-worldy enemy. The predator itself is just as mesmerizing. Sticking to basically the same full-body-suit as the first film, you could swear the alien is a living breathing thing right in front of your face. It remains one of the most terrifying and interesting creatures ever created. A great film crew (and cast) assist the predator in making this sequel well worth the purchase.",1124496000,,2267,4.855297157622739
385409,4,6301963725,"I'm a huge Aliens and Predators fan and I've been one since I was 13. For other fans like myself, you've probably seen the first Predator, which was a Sci-Fi Classic and introduced another fantastic, gruesome monster to the world back in 1987, coincidentally the year I was born. The action was pulse pounding and the storyline simple yet gripping. Fans the world over couldn't wait for the next Predator movie, and for 3 years they waited patiently. Then in 1990, Predator 2 was released, the long awaited sequel to ""Predator."" And here's my take on the film...

The year is 1997, 10 years after ""Predator."" The place, Los Angeles. Crime in the city is rife and the police seem powerless to stop druglords, thieves, murderers, rapists and robbers. Enter Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), a cop with his own rules and ideas of getting rid of the crime epedemic in L.A. This is not the only epedemic however as a great heat-wave hangs over the city. And as you may have learned from the previous movie, Predators are attracted by hot conditions and areas of conflict. And so in no time at all a Predator is lurking the streets and building tops of the city, hunting prey and searching for trophies. However, it seems that most of these trophies are criminals and drug-lords; (this is never really explained, but anyway) and so it seems that Harrigan and his partners must now discover the mystery behind these brutal murders. And of course, what they find is out of this world...the storyline is simple but really allows the action and intrigue to come to the fore, so it gets a comfy 4/5.

Unlike ""Predator,"" you don't really learn as much about the characters (except for Glover) and you don't really get to see the full spectrum of their personalities or grow any kind of attachment to them. There again, it may just make the idea of killing the other characters easier, so that doesn't really detract from the movie. The Predators themselves are realistic and as gruesome and ugly as ever, and Stephen Hopkins really succeeds in maintaining the pragmatic and ""dirty"" look of the Predators. Hopkins certainly keeps the franchise afloat with this movie that adds to the mythology behind the Preds. We find out that they are actually social creatures and have spaceships and customs like human beings. In this way we learn more about the Predators and find that they are complex, ancient beings that are, in some ways, more similar to humans than we previously thought. The movie gets 5/5 for maintaining the franchise and giving us a greater insight into the social structures of the Predators.

Not only are we introduced to new concepts about the social and traditional aspects concerning Predators, but also some new weapons! This is the first time we see the ""Disc"" weapon, which seems to have a built-in guidance system and seems capable of slicing through most materials. Harrigan actually steals and wields this weapon on the hunting Predator later on in the movie. We also see that Predators have more than one or two modes of vision, which is also interesting. This Predator also uses a different Med kit to the one in the original movie, which is pretty interesting as this Pred burns the wounds shut rather than suturing as in the first movie. And of course there are the normal weapons like the classic wristblade, spear and shoulder cannon. Hopkins has truly expanded on the story of the Predators and for that he is to be highly commended. 4.5/5 for allowing us to see deeper into the world of these monstrousities...

Overall it's not quite as good as the first, but it's still pretty strong and certainly won't disappoint fans. ""Predator 2"" gets 85% overall, so it gets a big fat ""A"" in my book. It lacks a little due to some small factors and just doesn't quite have the same appeal as the first movie, but that aside, it's very good. So buy it today if you love Sci-Fi action and are a Predator fan! A very good buy...",1124323200,,3944,4.695086705202312

I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10, and if I could give it an 11 out of 10, I would without hesitation. It was packed too the brim with blood and gore, intense fighting, strong language, and every other thing that an adult would want in a movie. There were many cool quotes, as well, and even a hot babe-NAKED!!!! And I should add that Danny Glover, the guy who played the hero, did a superb & excellent job and you all should have seen the extreme gunfire that goes for most of the movie. Any shooting fan would love it. Predator himself was as nasty as he should be, very cool and large and powerful, the weapons he used were stellar, and of course he was scary looking with or without his mask on, just like any sinister space monster should be. There were also a few funny parts, as well. Anyway, don't listen to the people who said this movie sucked.

385411,4,6301963725,"Through some of my first viewings of this movie, I really hated it.  I hated the style, didn't really like the characters, but lately I've realised that I really love this movie, still realizing that it's not as good as the original, but still entertaining for fans.  If you're the Roger Ebert type you won't like this film.  Danny Glover isn't meant to replace Arnold in any way, he's ment to tell the story of a completely different person in a different location.  Anyway, this DVD has some interesting stuff since it's really the first object on this planet that has devoted itself to Predator 2.  The documentary is still a sub-par less than an hour thing like we get on Predator 1 DVD, but hey, it's entertaining to watch.  We get some special effects featurettes, some pointless but fun weapons profiles and Fox decided not to confuse me with a trailer for the quadrilogy and actually use trailers from this movie.  I was also appreciative towards Fox for including the featurettes on the bare bones version DVD (which I bought, and then about a week later this DVD was announced *sigh*).  What I find most interesting is the Hard Core section of the complete segments.  Not really all of them are included, but we do get a good helping and what is included with them is the closest to deleted scenes that we'll get.  I don't understand why Alien Resurrection is good enough to get a numbered collector's edition digipack and Predator 2 just gets an amaray case with a slipcover.  Not that I like digipacks, they're just a little more classy.  To support my position on this, The Fly and The Fly II will both be in this series of collector's edition numbered DVD's.  The Fly II is not bad IMO, but if it gets a digipack, Predator 2 should also.",1120176000,4,1751,4.555910543130991
385412,4,6301963725,"After the huge success of Predator the studio thought it was inevitable to make a sequal.  The screenwriters from the first one also wrote this one which is one of the best monster, or sci-fi sequals ever to be captured on film.

Director Steven Hopkins signed on for this film, which takes place in 1997.  When it hit theaters it took place in the future.  The predator if you didn't already know, can adapt to any setting it is using invisible camaflague, they took that into an urban setting.

This time it's not only a science fiction story, but adventure, mystery, and horror.  Danny Glover does what he can with the scripts poor dialougue, but how much can he do?  Kevin Peter Hall the predator is the only actor on both Predator movies.

If you enjoyed the first one, you will most likely enjoy this one.  The special features on this version again are wonderful compared to the last edition which only had a trailer and two short featurettes, which are included on this version as well, so there is no reason to buy the other version.  There is a full length audio commentary with Director Stephen Hopkins and with the writers, as well as a making of featurette.

385414,3,6301963725,"Well, i don't own this DVD, but i have the cassete and have watched it on cable several times. To be honest, i don't think that this was even close to being as well done or original then the first Predator W/ Arnold. That said, even though it is a weak follow up, it does have its good points. This has been nothing more for me then a brainless action/violence flick that you would watch sometimes for killing time, and it does its job well in that role so i feel that 3 stars is acurate because it's not great but it still is good in some parts.

Now my first reaction to this film was mixed, i was having a hard time accepting the fact that Danny Glover was chosen for this role. Danny is a great actor, but he is not someone i would picture fighting the Predator (although he puts up a hell of a fight against it), i have always pictured him as the gruff, hardnosed Murtoch from the Leathal Weapon series. He plays LT Harrigan (who is basically a Murtoch w/ serious anger issues) in a crime infested Los Angles that is the next hunting ground for the Predator. Other actors here were Bill Paxton as some wise@$$ rookie cop who often gets lectured by LT Harrigan for not being a ""team player"", i'm glad when the Predator takes him out in the subway, he was the most insipid and useless character in the movie. Gary Busey plays as a govermant big wig secretly hunting the creator responsible for the number of bizzare killings in LA, this is a common role for Gary, so he fit in well for that part. At first you might hate him (which i did), but he becomes a cooler character when you learn more about him as the movie goes on, it almost makes you feel sorry for him when he gets severed in two from the Preds frisbee attack in the meat locker. Then there are the two secondary characters; Danny, who was Mike Harrigans (Danny Glover) best freind and partner who was killed by the Pred (which is basically the whole reason why Danny presues the thing) and the female cop (i forget her name, but she was also the female marine in Aliens), Both of these characters were severly underscpited. Danny is killed off so early that you had no time to develope any commection to him and could really care less that he is dead, and the female cop really does nothing but follow Harrigan around. Through the whole thing, you are basically watching Danny Glover go on  a @$$ kicking spree, there is no real cast of characters that are memorable or that you care about when they die, like in Pred 1.

This whole thing is one big ultra-violence fest, the opening secene is a giant battle in the steets of LA between the drug lords and the police. Such emphasis is put on this war between the Colombians, Jamacians and the police that it almost over shadows the fact that there is some creator out there hunting people down. I thought they went way overboard with some of this gang member stuff, and the final battle between Harrigan and Pred was a little bit of a let down. The most redeeming part of the whole movie is when we get to see inside the Predator ship, you find out that the Preds have been around long before humans have as there is a t-rex skull in the trophy room as well as a xenomorph skull (those bugs from the Alien series). The end was a serious let down to me, there is no clear winner or loser here, just some stupid flintlock pistol from 1678 he gets or whatever and ending with Danny Glover standing in a smoking crator looking like an albino shouting curses. The ending will kill you, because it is such a let down yet, it also makes you want to see the sequil to this. We waited 14 years for a sequil to the Predator story and we got that piece of c r a p AvP.

This is alright if you are interested in the Predator movies, but it is inferior to the first. However, this is by far better then AvP, which gets one star. Don't expect it to be as good as it was with Arnold, no, this is like a cross between COPS,Leathal Weapon and the occasional guest apperance of a invisible alien with a IR viewing helment and shoulder mounted laser cannon w/ a triangle dotted targeting system.",1116201600,,4092,4.276129032258065

385454,5,6301963725,"About Amazon's plot descriptions, I wish to make a few notes. They said there is little sense in the predator returning. I can't imagine why this would seem so odd. In this movie we learn the predators have been visiting Earth throughout just about all of human history. They keep coming here because there's never any shortage of interesting game. The predator in the first film was just one of many. Also Amazon asks what's the big deal with trying to stop the predator, since he kills drug dealers. First of all, I'd always thought the police were supposed to treat vigilantism itself as a crime, and besides which the way the predator mutaliates his prey suggests a really sick psycho, so the cops going after him makes perfect sense. Add to the fact that the predator kills Danny Glover's partner early on in the film, and I'd say the hero's motive for hunting the predator is pretty well established. Finally, people say Danny Glover is a poor replacement for Swartzenagger. Besides the fact that Glover's acting is superior, the first film, let's face it, was first and foremost a Swartzenagger vehicle. It was all about,""This time, Ah-nold's kicking alien ass!""

385457,4,6301963725,"Following a wildly successful film is never easy, especially one backed up with the star power of an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who apparently chose not to reprise his role as he didn't care for the script, feeling the idea of a Predator film set in a major metropolitan city was a poor one, instead working on a little film called Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)...perhaps you've heard of it...rumor has it Patrick Swayze was offered the starring role in this film, but couldn't accept due to injuries sustained during the filming of Road House...so with the success of Lethal Weapon (1987) and Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) under his belt, Danny Glover was chosen, for better or worse...written by Jim and John Thomas (the brothers behind the 1987 film Predator), Predator 2 (1990) was directed by Stephen Hopkins (Judgment Night, Lost in Space), and stars Danny Glover (Silverado, Lethal Weapon).  Also appearing is Gary `Mr. Head Injury' Busey (Under Siege, Black Sheep), Rubn Blades (Mo' Better Blues, The Two Jakes), Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man, Colors), Bill Paxton (Navy SEALS, Twister), Robert Davi (The Goonies, Die Hard), Adam Baldwin (My Bodyguard, D.C. Cab), Morton Downey Jr. (Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation), and Kevin Peter Hall (Harry and the Hendersons, Predator) as the Predator, but obviously not the same one as in the first film (well, obvious if only you've seen the first film, which you should before seeing this one).

The film is set in L.A. (the original setting was to be New York City), in the grim, near future of 1997 (remember, the film was released 1990, and back then, we didn't have the brightest outlook on the future).  The city and police are under siege by not only ruthless, excessively armed drug gangs, but also an oppressive heat wave.  Smack dab in the middle is Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Glover), a play by his own rules cop doing what's necessary to get the job done, which often rubs his superiors the wrong way (can you smell a clich here?  It's the first of many).  But wait, it appears there's a new player in town, one that even the powerful drug gangs seem to fear, later identified as an extraterrestrial being whom we've come to know as a Predator...apparently drawn by the hot climate and extreme amount of conflict, in town with a few days (and people) to kill, its prey being man, and begins making short work of the gangs, what with all the beheadings, disembowelings, flaying of skin, spine removals, and so on...this draws the attention of some gooberment types, headed by Peter Keyes (Busey), who have an interest in not only the alien, but its super awesoma weaponry and technology (oh my, another clich).  The stage is set, the players in place, the bloodbath ready to ensue...

I did enjoy this film, and I appreciated the effort to try and stick to the formula that made the first so successful, but the absence of director John McTiernan (he chose to instead direct The Hunt for Red October) and Arnold Schwarzenegger is painfully noticeable.  Glover and director Hopkins do a good job, but the effect is kind of like going from tender, juicy steak to a hamburger.  I like hamburgers, but next time you're in a restaurant, check the menu and notice the price difference between the two...anyway...one thing that has puzzled me with this film is the element of Predators visiting the Earth and hunting humans on a fairly regular basis.  The impression I got of the species is that their whole lifestyle, be that as it may, seems to revolve around the hunt, and the more difficult the prey, most likely the greater the prestige and status.  If that's the case, why do they visit the Earth, specifically to hunt humans?  Let's face it, we're pretty easy targets, given their technology, weapons, and various other strengths.  Sure, once in awhile they may come across a worthy opponent, like Schwarzenegger's character in the previous film, or Glover here, but in general, they mop the floor with us (I'm unsure the body count in this film, but it was very high)...but I digress, as is my wont...the script (which I heard had been re-written something like 20 times) is pretty rough, and the plot laden with clichs, but the pacing is strong, and the action thorough, so the end result is entertaining.  I heard a decent amount of violent gristle had been removed to avoid a NC-17 rating, so I was curious why, with this release, they didn't reinstate this material, or included in a `deleted scenes' section.  The film contains lots of gooey bits, but it did feel like parts (no pun intended) were missing.  Maybe those scenes excised don't exist anymore.  I sorta groaned at the composition of Glover's squad, an African American, two Hispanics (one male, one female in Blades and Alonso, respectively), and a Caucasian (Paxton), as I felt it was a lame attempt to present a cross section, I guess meant to represent the community...the actors did generally do a good job, but the material really wasn't there to allow for a cohesiveness to settle in, like in the first film.  I'm not talking so much about deep character development, as that wasn't a necessity in the first film, but Schwarzenegger and his crew felt like a real team, hardened by past experiences, and that wasn't the case here.  The inclusion of the new Predator weapons was cool, and the production overall is pretty slick, but ultimately falls a little short.  And can someone tell me how the huge Predator ship came to be parked underneath the city unnoticed by anyone?

The widscreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture looks sharp, and the audio clean and clear.  This is a 2 DVD set, with most all the special features (outlined in detail on the Amazon site) appearing on the 2nd DVD.  3 stars for the film, plus one for the release.

385460,3,6301963725,"Watching PREDATOR 2, it was easy for me to see Danny Glover and Mel Gibson's characters from the Lethal Weapon series wisecracking and chasing this alien killer.  Only in this one, Glover is the loose cannon and his compatriates are Maria Conchita Alonso (who I always enjoy) and Ruben Blades.  Not having been one of those blown away by PREDATOR (it was fun but nowhere near the level of ALIENS), I didn't really see the need for a sequel.  While the special effects are top notch, the Predator creature is not as menacing at times, because he is capable of being destroyed, and his invisible shenanigans get old after a while.  One big hole is the fact that we're told Maria Conchita is pregnant, but no follow up and where and who was the father?  Excuse the digression, that just puzzled me.  There's some exciting action sequences, but nothing we haven't seen before.  Glover overdoes his role, obviously not learning from Mel how to play a near psychotic cop; Gary Busey brings his usual sneer to the role of the mysterious government agent, and Kent McCord (Adam 12) pops up briefly as Glover's boss.  This year's AVP is a much better movie, but if you liked PREDATOR a lot, you'll probably enjoy this sequel.",1108598400,,1216,4.649532710280374
385461,2,6301963725,"This movie is typical Hollywood screwing up a good, clever idea and turning it into some sort of quasi-racial statement.  Hence, Danny Glover in the lead role as Afro-Super Cop who breaks all the rules of common sense, never questions his dumb-ass actions, and bores one to death with his highly unsnappy quips and Mr. Know-it-all, testosterone-head attitude.  It would have been better if he had been blown away in the first scene.  Then, we could all focus of the Predator and root for his ultimate success in the cesspool of Los Angeles.  The action scenes are acceptable, except when the Predator encounters Glover, who he decides to keep alive so the story can stumble along from one macho encounter to another.  All the white guys just don't measure up to Danny's smarts.  That's why he's left standing at the end, I guess. Having him look like he is attending an aboriginal wedding ceremony for the final scene is nice touch, though.  Overall, this flick could have been alot better without the implied social statements highlighting the greatness of the lead human.  Too bad the Predator lost this one.

The first half of the film is a bit weak, but the second half gets much better as we get to see the Predator in action.  Language is rough throughout, which is somewhat expected however it gets a little old afterwhile, the dialogue certainly could have better written.  There is one graphic sex/fight scene near the beginning of the film which I thought was over the top and not necessary - certainly not recommend for any age.  The extras on the second disc are pretty interesting, especially if you are into the whole Predator/Aliens saga.

385527,4,6301963725,"""Predator"" is one of those classic '80's sci-fi action films that trancends time. Like it's bretheren Aliens, Total Recall, Robocop and all the rest, they were bloodier, grungier, more foul-mouthed and more realistic movies (in a sense) than today's aciton flicks. Aliens and Predators were scary as hell because they were actually there, coming to kill you.

So how do you follow up a classic action film like Predator? You don't.

Predator 2 is the comic book to Predator's novel. The first one is a brooding, thrilling story that ratchets up the tension like only a novel can, fully depicting the desperate situation the characters are in. Predator 2 is the flashy, action-oriented comic book that splashes vivid images on the screen and goes for the throat with a ton of action. That doesn't make the sequel a crappier version of the original, simply a different slant on it.

Police are battling it out with rival gangs engaged in a turf war and that sounds like an average day in L.A. The L.A. of this movie was taking place, at the time, in the near future so it made sense that the police were less able to contain the violence of the city, and it also made sense that the news media had simply increased its blood-lust. This notion has been shown is several comic books over the years. Judge Dredd comes to mind, and this movie is certainly better than its adaptation.

Predator 2 is also a case of ""more of the same"" to a degree. Alot of what you see and how the story progresses is really a modification of the original (especially the thrilling climactic battle) BUT... more of the same in this case is not a bad thing, since the material it's repeating was so darn good.

Anyways, long story short... if you're bored one night and no one's around, make some popcorn, grab some Dr. Pepper, dim the lights and enjoy a purely visceral experience. Sometimes it's a lot of fun to watch something without getting heavily invested in it.

P.S. Now that AVP has been released and the two movie series are officially connected, there's one big inconsistancy between them which is the casting of Bill Paxton both in Aliens and in Predator 2. Apparently Pvt. Hudson lived several hundred years earlier, had the same wise-ass personality and got killed... before he got killed again. No matter, he's what will keep you coming back to this movie again, and again.",1107388800,3,2363,4.668269230769231
385528,5,6301963725,"Set in 1997 in Los Angeles, it is a hot and sunny day over there as Columbian and Jamaican drug dealers are at war with each other. The infamous dreadlocked fish-faced fanged creature from another world is in the urban jungle of L.A. hunting for some prey as it begins to butcher innocient people and Police officer Lt. Harrigan ( Danny Glover) is the next target for the Predator's thirst for blood.

An exciting and extremely violent sequel to the 1987 Arnold Schwartzenger classic is definitely just as good as the original. There is some gore in this movie to please gore lovers everywhere, a solid cast ( Gary Busey, Maria Cochita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Reuben Blades, Adam Baldwin and Morton Downey Jr.), the original writers of the first movie, decent acting, non-stop thrills, and look for a recongizable alien skull on Predator's trophy collection.

The new 2-Disc special edition DVD is even superior to the old DVD release that was released in 2003 with great extras like killer featurettes, two cool audio commentaries by the filmmakers, publicity materials, Behind-the-scenes still gallery, a look at Predator's weapons, and two hilarious mock news footage from the movie.

385530,4,6301963725,"At first viewing, ""Predator 2"" seemed lame.  After viewing AVP I decided to give it another chance.  Actually this one could have been a cross-over sequel if Mel Gibson was in it and they used their ""Lethal Weapon"" characters.  Danny Glover was an interesting choice for an action lead.  Not as suspensful as numeral uno, but loaded with tons of action.  It's virtually nonstop!

What is missing is the governator for one, or at least an action star.  The special effects are fine, but the story is loaded with colorful stereotypes of ethnic groups which some might be offended.  Also, therre is loads of blood and freakin' profanity.

Question is, could they have gotten Stallone, Van Damme, Pauly Shore?  Why not.  This movie has a great deal of humor, some unitentional.  Casting the late Morton Downey as an obnoxious TV reporter is dead on.

Pack to the DVD.  This one is special because it is loaded with several behind the scenes documentaries, audio commentaries, trailers.  Also, the new transfer is great and the soundtrack has been greatly improved.",1106870400,3,1060,4.876404494382022
385531,5,6301963725,"Predator 2 can now stand proud alongside the previous classic entry, not because pitting Glover's team of investigative cops against the Alien is somehow on the same par with Arnie and his commandos, but because it is non-stop action from start to finish, in an urban landscape, with lots of very memorable scenes to boot. It was a good call to have Stephen Hopkins direct this piece because of his art design background making the set pieces all look uniquely convincing and highly original. We also have great generation actors all coming together for this vehicle - Glover, Paxton, Busey, Baldwin and Davi.

Memorable stuff includes a great urban drug shoot out at the start, Jamaican voodoo (King Willie is a classic character), alien artefact evidence, DEA hunting aliens with high tech weaponry, the subway massacre, slaughterhouse slicing and the final battle with a twist. Hopkins may sacrifice a little plot development, character depth and the suspension of disbelief, including actors who suddenly hit their target spot on when missing all the time before (yeah that sort of forgivable stuff) but you can not deny that this has twice as much action than the first, a way more Predator and much details about this creature. And for that it lives up to it title in aces where others did not (Predator 1 was really more about Arnie and the latest one is for kids).

The fact that Predator 2 does not pause for breath is the reason why it gets the five start treatment. This is great science-fiction through and through, even though it is a sequel. You will remember this one more I think.

Also I find it interesting that at the end an old gun reads ""1715 - Raphael Adolini"". Although the name means nothing I believe this was to set up Predator 3 in the 17th century. That never emerged but would certainly be more interesting than the vs. Alien instalment.

Predator 2 is a well worthy entry in anyone's action/horror/sci-fi collection.",1103673600,5,1946,4.8

385534,2,6301963725,"While the sequel does expand upon the Predator mythos a little and does a few things right, it's definitely inferior, because all of the characters except for Danny Glover's are so annoying and abhorrent that they almost make the Predators look like good guys in comparison. Gang members, drug dealers, mysoginistic cops, let 'em all die, I say. It takes all the tension out of your movie if you're praying for the monsters to get the characters.",1099180800,2,446,4.805194805194805
385595,4,6301963725,"A million times better than the first movie!, whilst Predator 1 played out like a standard Hollywood slasher movie (half a dozen unlikeable characters being killed off one by one in the woods by a barely seen killer who wears a mask (the makers of Friday the 13th movies should sue!); Predator 2 wisely loses the vile macho grunt characters mumbling horrible dialogue in the jungle of the first film and relocates to the hunt to Los Angeles.

Predator 2 sees Danny Glover investigating a gang war between rival drug gangs only to find out that each gang is getting slaughtered by an unknown foe and Glover assumes their deaths are caused by the other gang, however when the predator starts murdering members of Glovers own team and starts following him around LA, he soon realizes that he up against a far more deadly adversary.

The LA backdrop offers a significantly more cinematic feel to part 2 than the trees n' leaves setting of the first, Director Stephen Hopkins amps up the action scenes as you would expect of any action movie sequel (lifting a whole scene from Aliens along the way) and moves the movie along at a damn fine pace (including a 40 minutes chase scene for the second half of the movie).

Danny Glover whilst a little miscast as the action hero, still manages to bring charm and determination to the lead role, which is more than can be said for old arnie in the first movie who simply smoked cigars and made James Bond style quips.

The movie fleshes out far more of the predators `hunter' mythos than the first, which really adds an extra dimension to the movie than your standard monster movie, which no doubt went a long way to establishing the Predator as an iconic Hollywood bad guy.

The movie like the first, is available everywhere at a very reasonable price on DVD; if you like your monster movies with a great bad guy, bristling with action and damn good make up effects, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.",1097712000,6,1950,4.591954022988506
385596,2,6301963725,"Predator was hardly the best film ever made but it was a superlative action film, something this movie is not.

In the Los Angeles of the future (now the Los Angeles of the past) crime is terrible, the mayor is on vacation, and the city is in the grip of an astounding heatwave.  One of the things this movie did rather well was establish how hot it is, for this adds a palpable sense of tension as well as keeping with the original Predator's storyline (he only hunts when it's hot).  The Predator invades LA, causes a ruckus, and protagonist Danny Glover must figure out why gang members are dropping like flies and a sinister G-man keeps interfering with him.

Aside from a few decent scenes (the scene in the subway was well done) this movie is far from commendable.  The action sequences are directly cartoonishly, the characters annoying, Danny Glover lacks the starpower and screen presence of Schwarzenegger, and the ending anty-climactic and reeking of deus ex machina.  Nothing like the wonderful mano a mano battle between Arnie and the Predator.  Morover, Gary Busey's turn as the G-Man is irrelevant and annoying.

Although this is certainly preferable to AVP and passable as a popcorn flick, it does not deserve being mentioned with the original Predator or the Alien series.  4.5/10",1096761600,4,1297,4.832579185520362

I didn't see the sequal for several more years, and when I finally did, I was very dissapointed.  Without Ahhnold (or anyone exceptionally big) the movie just didn't seem as good.  The first one was all about the action, thrills, and effects.  This one was about how much swearing and sexual ""stuff"" as they could fit into a two hour time frame.  I could do without all of that, I want good action, a worthy plot, and good acting.  This movie lacked all of that.  The action was slow, boring, and just not the same.

If you want a good movie, stay away from this and go with the original -- or even the Alien series, the first one (the only one I saw) was just as good.  However, I also advise you all stay away from wasting money on AVP.  Rent is when it's cheap, or borrow it from a friend.

385602,4,6301963725,"First we must be honest with ourselves.  Danny Glover is not playing some random LA detective in this movie.  He is simply reprising his role as Roger Murtaugh from the immortal Lethal Weapon series.  However, the resulting film featuring Good ol' Sgt ""I'm gettin too old for this . . . "" Murtaugh chasing after an evil alien human hunter is an action-packed, often humorous romp.  The ending gives the Predator character a little more depth, but still leaves its presence a mystery for the most part, yet somehow the monster remains the perfect bad guy that we all love to hate.

However, this movie never garnered the attention that its predecessor did.  This is likely due to the fact that we all wanted a Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up and got a slightly more humorous, plot-driven Predator featuring more of an everyman type of hero.

Yet what separates it from the first film is what makes it great.  Glover is not subbing for Schwarzenegger.  Rather, he is adding a new element to the story and, along with his supporting cast, some better acting than in the first and a slightly more intriguing plot.  All in all, this is a worthwhile movie to own and watch again and again.",1092355200,9,1178,4.674757281553398
385603,3,6301963725,"I was a huge fan of the original PREDATOR and recommend it to any sci-fi/action movie fan. But when I first saw PREDATOR 2 I was surprised at how big a dissapointment it was to the first movie. Danny Glover was pretty good as Mike Harrigan but he nowhere compares to Arnold, and the rest of the characters were just there to add a few more lines to the script. The one character I did find amusing was Bill Paxton, who, once again, dies acting obnoxious and herioc.
  The actual Predator was very impressive and had a lot more weapons than the one in the original, which I thought was cool. My favorite was the Smart Disk, which cut Gary Busey's character Keys in half. Stan Winston did another excellent job with the Predator, as he does in all his movies. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took for Steven Hopkins, the director, to reveal the actual creature. We've already seen it before, what's the point of holding it off until twenty minutes into the movie?
  The movie has quite a few good action scenes in the movie which do not disappoint, filled with blazing guns and buckets of blood on the floor. The thing that doesn't make sense is why they had a full minute of pure uneccesary nudity involving a prostitute and a gang member. A second later five Jamacians come in and the Predator just ends up killing them all.
  The light and sound in the film are very good for a cruddy movie and Fox did a good job. The extras include two featuretts including talks with the actors and the making of the Predator. There is also a theatrical trailer.

Ive seen this movie plenty of times, the first time being when i was 10. i like this movie equally if not more than the first one. this movie portrays the predtor character more of an hunting race rather than just a crazy alien like the first one. Which brings up a point, someone had posted earlier that they didn't understand how the predator came back to life from the first movie to be on this one. It didnt, this is a different predator, its a race of hunters that travel everywhere in hunt of good game. Also someone commented that the ship blew up on the last seen of this movie, it didnt.... it flew back into space at a high speed. if you look closely at the predator trophy room where they have their skull collection you can see an alien skull on the wall rack. all in all it is a great movie too much blood for my liking but the weapons and predators custom and ship make up for it. many great scenes like the subway fight and the unforgettable scene where the predator attacks a group of people that walked in on a couple while making love!!!

Danny Glover is a nice change as he relies on his gray matter to defeat this second predator, which makes the film seem down-to-earth.  This film is far more thought-provoking than the first, but that is because the first film is more action-based, while the second film is more character-based.

Danny Glover plays a maverick cop in the vein of Harry Callahan in Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies.  As Danny hunts down Columbian drug lords, he soon runs across an alien predator also hunting the same Columbian drug lords.  While Danny should be happy that someone else is taking out Columbian drug lords, apparently Danny would rather it be the police instead of an alien hunter, so soon Danny finds himself on the trail of the alien.
The original ""Predator"" had a number of plot holes that were easy to ignore because of the nearly non-stop action.  ""Predator 2"" has even more plot holes, and occasionally they intrude into the action enough that you have to pay attention to them.  Perhaps the biggest plot hole is the arrogance and stupidity of Gary Bussey as government agent Peter Keyes.  It seems that in action movies the feds always end up being portrayed as too good for everyone's own good, including their own.  If Gary and his team were as technologically astute as they appeared to be, they should have recognized that the alien could see their lights in the meat locker.  While that particular incident may have been the biggest plot hole, there are a number of others that are occasionally distracting that I will leave for the viewer to discover.
The real charm of this movie is that Danny is physically not a match for the predator, and thus must rely much more on his intelligence to thwart the predator.  The predator clearly has its own arrogance, for which it ultimately pays, but along the way the interaction between Glover and the alien provide for some very good scenes.
In one scene the predator has Danny Glover in a very bad situation.  Danny is able to make use of the alien's high tech boomerang weapon to cut off the alien's hand.  The alien escapes into a building across the way.  By using a cool looking colander the alien mixes a little glass and some other ingredients to make a kind of patch for the stub of his arm.  The noise the alien makes as it puts the molten glass and ceramic on its arm scares a little old lady in her bed, providing for a funny moment as the alien leaps out of the lady's bathroom and then her apartment, soon followed by Danny Glover, who has in the meantime found a clever way to get between the two apartment buildings.
""Predator 2"" is not quite as slick as the first ""Predator,"" and the plot holes are bigger.  For all that, I thought ""Predator 2"" achieved more of the potential of the alien hunter than the first movie, and the action was more frequent and more varied than in the first movie.  As with the first movie the final show down is between the main character and the alien, and the outcome is just about as uncertain.  While each movie has its charms and its weaknesses, and I am sure some prefer the first over the second, I still think the second has a lot to offer.",1082160000,4,3081,4.544303797468355

Lots of action violence bad language and gore just like the first one. This one was not big strong Arnold Dutch from the firts movie is replaced  by a puny African American police cop.  The location change into the city made the movie less scary and suspenful than it's prodescure.
Interesting thing there is several predators on earth this time instead of just one. The main Predatopr does not die  by self destruct like the on it  Instead he bleeds to death from the inside after his chest area is slice open.
There have been some changes made the predator has a view new eapons he did not have in the last film.  These include a long sharp spear.  A net made of some sharp  materal that can cut flesh.  His must deadly weapon a  buzzsaw slash bommerang like weapon. Just like at the end of the first one there is and explosion.
Instead of the predator it's the predators ship the cheezy part was when the predator gave him the only gun from  the 1700s  before the ship self destructs.

The main actor in the movie was good enough, and I liked the fact that I did not know about him at all before this movie. The effects were good too. Nothing was out of place for me apart from one thing!.....One thing that held it back viciously! ...... It wasn't the presence of underground trains in LA, which there are none of in real life, but instead the presence of Morten Downey Jr as a reporter, turning up repeatedly through the film trying to uncover the truth of what was going on, in ways as irritating to me as the man himself.  It utterly ruined the credibility of the picture! It turned it almost into a pile of s**t!
If the director would only recut the film removing all signs of this man, I would enjoy the movie much much more, and give it an extra star",1079308800,,1309,4.073643410852713

But the rest of it - I wasn't sure about. I wasn't keen on the original, but I will watch Arnold ""I'll be back"" Schwarzneggar movies. He's normally good in movies. Danny Glover was OK. He wasn't bad in the role. And also Gary Busey, who I was shocked, as he was so skinny! (I know him best for Point Break, and discovered that his hair was whitened, to make him look older than Keanu Reeves!) He was good, but it's a shame at the end, even if he does act almost like a bad guy.
What I found incredibly distracting from the movie, was seeing things from the Predator's point of view. It is a good thing to show once or twice - not every few scenes! It gets really annoying, and you know he can see in infra-red, there's no need to keep re-showing it!
The finale did confuse me to start with, but you just need to get your head around it.
Why didn't Arnold return? Because of Total Recall. He seems to never get round to doing some movies (Terminator) cos he's too ""busy"". But rumour has it, he didn't think it was a good idea to take the movie in the city, just to give a different angle. It did work much better in the jungle.
There's a lot of ""vs"" around at the moment - Freddy vs Jason, and rumoured to be Robocop vs Terminator, and Alien vs Predator. There's only so much you can do with these type of movies, and they will have all have similar storylines. Maybe next I'll have to see Aliens (maybe NOT!)",1078963200,2,1578,4.143322475570033

This is a VERY different movie from the first.  It's set in the CITY, not the jungle, and you get to see the predator a whole lot more, with his sweet weapons and technology.  Kevin Peter Hall (the predator) is as imposing as he was in the first one.  The movie is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while using some humor here and there to cut the tension.  I cant stress how much I love this movie.
OK, one thing I understand can confuse people- Arny is NOT in this movie at all.  I thought Danny Glover did an excellent job of pulling the viewer in, and making you want to watch.  Don't get me wrong, I love Arnold, but I'm no Arny FanBoy like some of the posts around here.  I think having him in this movie, in a totally different environment from the first, would have seemed contrived and very ""Arny was in the first, so we have to put him in this one.""
Without ruining the end, I must say I loved it.  Now here's another point of confusion- alot of people I've heard just don't get the ending.

385715,4,6301963725,"This sequel to 1987's highly popular and successful PREDATOR is not nearly as suspenseful as the original, but it is still exciting and action-packed.  Though star Danny Glover does not generate the same commanding screen presence that Arnold Schwarzenegger did in the first film, he is nonetheless a very talented and experienced actor, and he and his fantastic supporting cast--the gorgeous Maria Conchita Alonso, the always-delightful Bill Paxton, Hollywood staple Gary Busey, and Panamanian character actor Rub&eacute;n Blades--are able to raise 1990's PREDATOR 2 several notches above the average quality level of film sequels.
This time the eponymous extraterrestrial is on safari in the (then) futuristic Los Angeles of 1997, and it is Columbian and Jamaican drug lords, mon, that seem to be his prey of choice.  But when he spots the crime-fighting juggernaut Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) in action, he feels he's finally found the king of this urban jungle.  Harrigan then becomes the main object of the hunt, and the inevitable but exciting showdown takes place on the upper levels of a high-rise apartment in the L.A. slums.
The special FX of this sequel are not as fresh as they were in the original PREDATOR, but they are still adequate for the story and action.  The Alien, when visible, gets more screen time than he did in the first film, and genre fans will be delighted to see that Stan Winston and his staff manage to make the E.T. look just as cool as before.
In short, PREDATOR 2 is not as fresh, classy, or suspenseful as its progenitor, but Danny Glover--who, though no Arnie, is a talented and interesting actor--creates an urban hero who is both compelling and sympathetic.
THE DVD from Fox offers a nice anamorphic Widescreen transfer and good Dolby Digital sound, and in addition to the theatrical trailer, the extras include a pretty cool behind-the-scenes featurette that was filmed during the movie's original production.

The ""Predator"" long misunderstood as a frightening, evil, and bloodthirsty ... um ... um ... predator, is in fact shown in this film to really be a poor mixed up kid in the hell bound world of 1997 LA. Many will say that the Predator's tendency to kill, skin, and hang from scaffolds innocent people is extreme and sinister. I'm sure that we've all engaged in a little tom-foolery ourselves from time to time, and if he were on his planet following his own ancient and beautiful customs, that's all anyone there would make of it, tom-foolery. Furthermore, detractors might say that the Predator's cloaking ability is both unfair and dastardly, but it is in fact representative how frightened he is of life in general and his unwillingness to confront his problems, like puberty, head on.

385718,3,6301963725,"Sequel to the action-packed blockbuster, ""Predator"", replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger with Danny Glover and the jungles of Central America with the urban backdrop of Los Angeles.
Glover is Harrigan, a seasoned LAPD liutenant trapped in a war-infested heat wave as Columbian and Jamaican drug cartels attempt to wipe each other out. Little do the cops or the drug posses know, there is a new player in town: The Predator. The creature is even more deadly the second time around as he packs an even larger arsenal of weapons that he uses to take out everyone in sight. While the police believe that the gruesome murders are the work of the rival gangs, Gary Busey's government operative who is posing as a DEA agent is after something else. When Harrigan calls for a meeting with the Jamaican drug lord, King Willie, he soon begins to realize that he may be dealing with something other than rival dealers. Willie seems to believe that it is a supernatural force.
""Predator 2"" is not the epic suspense thriller that the first film was but it does have fun with its story. A sequence in which the invisible-cloaked Predator takes out an entire subway train full of cops, gang members, and random civilians is one of the movie's most memorable moments but the film doesn't slow down from there. Glover is chasing his alien nemesis all through out the city before tracking him down to a slaughterhouse where the creature disposes of an elite unit of governemnt agents in record time. There isn't a lot of plot to be found in the concluding act of the film (or anywhere else for that matter) but if you're the kind who likes for the action to tell the story then you won't be dissapointed.
This DVD edition of ""Predator 2"" isn't particulary remarkable. You get the film's theatrical trailer and a nice little featurette from the promotional days of the film but not much else.

However, the film raises some extremely serious questions.  When the predator first attacked, and people realized what they were dealing with, why didn't any of them pause and ask, ""Why does he hate us?""  The people acted terrorized by the violent actions of the predator, and struck back for the purpose of killing him.  Was that sort of response compassionate, diverse, tolerant or inclusive?  Rather than unilaterally attacking the predator with an army headed by three cowboys, shouldn't everyone have attempted to form a coalition (perhaps involving the United Nations) and worked to appease the predator?  Shouldn't they have settled for passing some resolutions against the predator, then employing inspectors to verify his compliance?  And if that had not worked, shouldn't they have given the inspectors more time?  The people gave no thought whatever to the predator's cultural or religious background -- they just tried to kill him as soon as possible, apparently thinking that was the only way to protect themselves from a totally irrational being.  Can you imagine how things would be in real life, if the good guys merely killed terrorists as quickly as possible, as was done in this movie?  Obviously if you kill them, they can't harm anyone any more -- but is that a compassionate, inclusive, tolerant and diverse manner in which to react to a murderous terrorist?

Truly enough, most fans are upset that there is no return of Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, but everybody has to realize that the Predator movies aren't like Aliens where Siqourney Weaver always returns to battle aliens.  This is different, these Predator movies s aren't based on Arnie, there based on the Predator.  Arnold isn't the main character, his charactor's name isn't even in the title, the predator is the main charactor and its name is in the title.  Arnold's name is in Terminator and he made a reapearence in that because he was the main character.  This series is based on the Predator and those who go in its way, in which this time, the man that faces the Predator is Danny Glover.  Anyway, here is the plot.
A new Predator comes to town and This time the story takes place in a city, not a jungle.  The predator has an eye out for a cop named Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover from LETHAL WEAPON) ).  But instead of just going straight for him, the predator starts having the appetite for drug dealers and starts killing many gangs in the city.  Although I am not really sure, but I think the Predator does that to mess w/ Mike Harrigan's head.  And things start to become personal when the Predator kills Harrigan's partner.  Mike Harrigan thinks that all the havoc is being caused by some major drug lord and will stop at nothing to find out.  Harrigan's problems isn't just getting catching this psych, or predator, but another person named Peter Keyes (Gary Busy who also happens to be from LETHAL WEAPON) also tries to crack the case and won't stop at anything to do so.  So now, both Harrigan and Keyes battle the Predator and each other.  And as far as I am concerned, the two have no intentions on getting along.
That is pretty much everything you will need to know about the movie's  plot.  This film is not as good as the first one, yet still good.  Danny Glover may be no Arnold Schwarzenegger yet he still does as good as Arnie would have done it.  I would be rating this a five star movie if the plot would have been a little better.

Ruben Blades was sadly missed although he was great for his all few minutes here and there, as well as Maria Conchita Alonso, Gary Busey and also too quickly knocked off, Bill Paxton.
The city was a great turn of events as the next battleground.
Other than being a little brainless, but still interesting (there are a few ideas in the plot that make it not DUMB), this movie was great.
Highlight: The Peadtor almost got caught by Busey's special force, however, he had a few tricks left to pull. Breathtaking. Effects as well, and that the enemy is also hunting druglords, not JUST Cops. All the actors were great.
Downfall: The usual fight of monster vs. man in the end....nothing special.
P.S. - the hardest part to watch was also my fav...when Bill Paxton was trapped on the Subway with the Preadtor, he still didn't back down. See the way he was firing dead centre on the beast with such agusto ?

385808,3,6301963725,"Even though this movie is VERY weak in some aspects, the premise of it is still kinda fun.  The entire first hour, however, is the weakest part of the film.  ""Predator 2"" lacks the stylishness and suspense that made the first film so memorable.  In this sequel, the suspense is undermined by stock characters, exceptionally weak and cliched dialogue and situations, the failed stunt casting of Morton Downey Jr., a horrible acting job by Maria Conchita Alonso (whose English seems to get worse with every movie she makes), and sloppy pacing.

The final 40 minutes or so are a little better, though.  As soon as it gets down to a mano y mano fight between the Predator and Danny Glover's character the film at least gets a bit more interesting and the tension builds a bit.  And the final fight between them on the alien craft, while short, at least has an interesting conclusion.

But just about everything else about the movie seems tedious and unsophisticated.

If you buy this DVD, I hope you at least get a good deal on it.  It doesn't stand up over time as well as the first ""Predator"" does, and in fact can be embarrassingly bad at times...

So skip this DVD unless you are just a ""Predator"" junkie.  This movie would make a decent once-every-other-year rental, but that's about as much merit as it deserves.

******************************

Wrote a second review in July 2009 and tried to post it -- then Amazon reminded me I'd already reviewed it in 2003.  But here's the 2009 version:

""He's in town with a few days to kill.""  That is probably my second-favorite movie poster tagline ever.

""Predator 2"" had the advantage of built-in audience of fans from the first film combined with an excellent story premise.  There were some problems in the execution, however.  Some of the character are a little too 2-dimensional and stock (Bill Paxton's character) and some of the acting is painful to watch (Maria Conchita Alonso).  Morton Downey Jr's appearance in the film depreciates the film.  It was stunt casting and makes the film dated.

Maria Conchita Alonso's English still sounds forced, as if she were struggling to get the lines out.  She tries too hard to speak English and act at the same time, and the effort shows.

I liked this movie when I first saw it in the theaters, especially the fight at the end.  There is a brief reveal in the alien spaceship of some of the Predator species' previously acquired trophies.  The fact that the main Predator was game enough to take Danny Glover's character on in hand-to-hand combat (when the Predator could have won handily with the means at his disposal) made the showdown that much more thrilling.

As I said, the film's entire premise was very cool.  In the hands of a better director and better cast it could have been a superb action thriller.  I wish the opening scene (the shootout in the streets) had been a little less stage-y.  It came off looking like a rehearsed stunt show at Universal Studios theme park.",1049155200,,2978,4.693050193050193
385809,5,6301963725,"Predator 2 is a good film. Not as good as the first but very entertaining. The Predator has more weapons and we learn more about why the Predator is around.
Check this out it is a great film with more gore and bloodshed than the first film.
Definitely worth watching if you loved the first film like me.",1047427200,,303,4.241379310344827
385810,5,6301963725,"To me, the Predator movies have become a cult classic.  I will go as bold as saying that they are at the same level as Star Wars.  I first watched the first movie on TV and thought ""man, this movie rocks"".  What fascinates about Predator is that it portrays an alien lifeform that is not your typical hollywood ""black eyed"" and scrawny humanoid.  It is actually believable.  Everything from the flesh, face, hair, and movement is real.  This is because there is actually a 7 feet tall actor underneath that monstrous costume.  I might add that the actor who played the predator in both movies sadly passed away years ago.  The technology the predator has is tremendously impressive and lethal: the flying blade, the retractable spear, the laser cannon, the cloaking device, and the spectral vision modes.  It is interesting to think that the whole species thrive on hunting.  I mean their culture, technology, and livelihood revolve around hunting other species; not necessarily for food but more importantly as trophies.  In a way, they are no different than us.  We go out on a safari to hunt lions and elephants with our sophisticated weaponry and camouflage.  The animals are fearful and helpless of our weapons as much as we are of the predator's weapon.  But the difference is we have intelligence and we can fight back.  The predator is a fascinating and intelligent creature with a savage way of life.  In this sense, we must respect and admire the creature for what he is: a lethal and powerful hunter.
Predator 2 is an excellent sequel to the first.  It has the perfect backdrop: Los Angeles, which in itself can be a jungle.  We transitioned from a tropical jungle to a surburban jungle.  This is the predator's richest hunting ground.  The movie follows up on the previous by having the Gary Busey character who have been active in tracking the predator.  He has learned from the previous encounter with this species and adapts human technology to conceal himself and capture the predator.  But he is too arrogant and dismisses the predator's amazing ability to adapt.  This is his own undoing.  And this is where Danny Glover's come in and triumph.  Using his brute and battle-hardened skills as a cop from the streets of LA, he just might be able to defeat this monster.
This movie is a perfect sequel to the first.  That's why I bought it on DVD.  I've been waiting for this for so long.  I also have the first one on DVD, which has DTS.  My only gripe is that the director and producers fail to make a documentary about the Predator phenomenon.  There are thousands of fans out there who would like to see that.  They have a making of the movie but that's not enough.  There should be a documentary to explore the culture, homeworld, and traditions of this species.  Who are the Predators?

(Makes sense to me... oh, no, wait, it doesn't) 3. The Predator decides to hunt members of crazy Voodoo gangs that are in some sort of drug war.

The story is tight, the action scenes well done, even the acting is overall pretty good (something many action flicks, incl Predator 1 cant boast). But it does have flaws... The mysterious quality of the original is far lessened. And the greatest sin of all... this DVD is only 108 minutes??? Yup they *CENSORED* entire scenes from the film! Remember the fight scene between the Pred & El Scorpio at start? Its almost entirely gone (no net, no spear, no claws, no nothing!). Other scenes are also trimmed (reduced gore mainly).

385813,4,6301963725,"Okay, so Arnold's not in it.  What's the big deal?  If Sigourney Weaver hadn't needed to be the star of the very very big universe that the ""Alien"" movies are set in, then THOSE flicks might not have gone so astray just halfway into the series.  Although Danny Glover has always been an excellent actor, the PREDATOR is the true star of these movies, and if there's one thing that both ""Predator"" films have established, it's that the Predators have been hunting on Earth for centuries.  ""Predator 2"" works very nicely as an expansion of the original concept (vs. being just another cheap knockoff with the same star for added marketability).  ""Predator"" is a concept which can span endless enviornments with endless characters, and I'm proud of the makers of ""Predator 2"" for taking advantage of that.  Taking the franchise to the big city of L.A. lends a dynamic that is wonderfully different from the first movie's more isolated jungle setting, and allows the story to be truly expanded by showing us more significant details about not only the hunting ethics of the Predators, but the fact that humans are aware of their presence and have (for years) been actively seeking to confront and capture them.  Rather than stagnating on the same old premise that was introduced in ""Predator,"" ""Predator 2"" actually has the courage to evolve it (much like ""Aliens"" did for ""Alien"").  Sure, the basic idea is now familiar, and yes, the killings are more predictable and notably less suspense-inducing than in the original movie, but it's definitely a step in the right direction for the evolution of a fine movie series that hopefully has not ended here!",1045267200,2,1649,4.864285714285714

In my opinion the only reason this movie worked at all is because of the changes the makers of the film made to the setting and the cast. If they had tried to do a sequal without these changes it probably would have flopped. It was good that they shook things up and gave the veiwers something else to ponder.
Now in the jungles of Los Angeles instead of the jungles of a Souoth American country the hunt has begun yet again.  Danny Clover does a great job of avoiding his own slaughter,and does eventually take down the bad guy.  If you go into this movie expecting a film of the same caliber of its predecessor you will be slightly disapointed, but if you have an open mind be prepared for a not perfect, but enjoyable ride.",1044835200,,893,4.186046511627907

Now the story line isn't all that involved, and parts need a lot of help (he breaks the medicine cabinet without looking for band-aids? Hehe), but the movie wasn't really all that bad.

I was impressed with Danny Glovers performance. Is it any wonder why we liked him so much in the Lethal Weapon series. This is well worth seeing.

385952,2,6301963725,"There was a time when I thought 'Predator 2' was better than the first. It was a long while ago, around the time it first came out on cable. For some reason, at the time I liked it more than Arnie's outing with the otherworldly hunter-killer. But after watching it for the first time in several years just recently, I can honestly say I don't understand how I considered this to be even remotely as good as the first 'Predator'. Oh sure, it's got a semi-decent level of cheesiness to it (something I always look for in a flick), but P2 just ain't got the goods. Danny Glover's character, the movie's 'hero', is not all that impressive. Here he's basically just an inferior combo of his and Mel Gibson's personas from the 'Lethal Weapon' flicks. He also suffers from not having quite the physical presence and big-name appeal that Schwarzenegger had in the first go-round.
Another thing that brings this one down a notch: the casting of Bill Paxton doing what he does best (or worst, depending on your point of view): playing a smarmy, smart-alecky, really annoying guy. I felt relieved rather than terrified when he gets offed by the Predator that's stalking drug lords & Jamaican posses throughout the slums of L.A. Speaking of killing Paxton, he's the only actor who's ever been 'taken out' by a Terminator, an Alien, and a Predator. Throw THAT one your movie-geek posse the next time you host a DVD watching marathon! Show them how much of a buncha posers they really are!
But, there were some upsides. Aside from the all-too-merciful death of Mr. Paxton's character, I thought the climactic one-on-one battle between our hero and the Predator on board the aliens' space ship was pretty cool in a hokey way. And I liked a major city being the main setting for the action; you know, that whole 'concrete jungle' mystique and stuff- or something. Other than those parts, however, I think you'll be in for the longest 90 minutes of your life here. So unless you're really curious or desperate, or like really silly cheesy flicks, just shelf this one and give the first 'Predator' another viewing! Consider yourself warned...

385953,5,6301963725,"Predator is great, and Predator 2 is better! I agree with other reviewers that it stands alone and is not just a sequel, but still glorifies the Predator the same way that part one did. The effects and acting are better, as is the story and the music score, and the film has more replay value.
Some people are missing the point. Why would they put Arnold in part 2? Why is Danny Glover such a bad choice? Hes not! He is tough and angry as the murderer of his friend (the pred) has made things personal. His acting is great, much better than ANYONE in part one let alone Schwartzenegger. But once confronted by the predator he is terrified, and goes into survival mode, while still wanting revenge. The conclusion is great, although perhaps blowing up half of LA would have been better.
People misunderstnad what the Predator is doing in this film. He is hunting down Harrigans friends in order to attract him to a 'one on one' much like Arnie in part one. Its not just a senseless killing spree the Predator is on, he picks a target he knows can fight and he fights them! He lined up Harrigan as a foe after his brave fight in the first scene, and leads him on. The subway scene and subsequent chase are deliberately to challenge Harrigan, as is the scene at the graveyard.
In addition to this is a coverup operation to capture the Predator, which the Predator masacres in the best scene within the whole franchise at the slaughterhouse.
And the Predator trophy cabinet!! Thats the best idea bar none with an alien drone skull together with a human one. The sequel has humour without corn, and together with Predator makes for a great series which really should be continued into part 3.",1011657600,6,1687,4.498371335504886

386019,3,6301963725,"PREDATOR 2 is the sequel to Arnold Schwarzenegger's action packed adventure film, PREDATOR.  This time around, it is the year 1997 in Los Angeles, and there is another loose 'Predator'.  Now an L.A. detective (Danny Glover- Lethal Weapon Series) is the only one to stand in the way of the Predator's destructive, and many times, blood drenched paths.  From a city street shootout, to a freaky gutting building, to a subway, onto a family's house, into a bone collecting black druglord's alley, then into an old couple's bathroom and back into its home ship, the Predator leaves behind a brutal trail of mass destructive power.
MY REVIEW:
""THIS MOVIE IS GOOFY MANY TIMES!  First off, DANNY GLOVER?  A group of heavy armed commandoes couldn't destroy this PREDATOR!  But an L.A. cop, set in an unrealistic 1997 New York (This movie was made in 1990), could beat this creature!????  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, the big guy himself, was left half dead in the original!  But now, GLOVER was only left at the end of PREDATOR 2, covered in white sand and only had a few cuts and scratches!  This movie failed to look at the original PREDATOR in the right direction to make an accurate, really entertaining sequel.  This PREDATOR was supposed to be smarter than the first, and it had much better weapons than the original PREDATOR did!  It is [bad] in that aspect, but the film is still very entertaining, just not nearly as good as the original PREDATOR.  The acting by DANNY GLOVER, BILL PAXTON and GARY BUSEY was just odd. It was a typical, expected plot too.  THE PREDATOR IS IN THE CITIES, SKINNING PEOPLE, ONLY ONE GOOFY COCKY POLICE OFFICER WILL GO TO STOP HIM, AND ONE MAN (Busey) IS OBSCESSED WITH HUNTING DOWN THIS PREDATOR AND CATCHING HIM WITHOUT A CLUE AS TO HOW IN THE HECK TO DO IT.  NOW IT IS THE COP AND THE PREDATOR, ONE ON ONE IN THE CITY.  This film tries to be scary like the first, but fails, and tries to have good acting, and fails, and tries to have an original plot with surprises, and fails.  Director STEPHEN HOPKINS (Lost in Space) should've given his directing chair up to RIDLEY SCOTT, JAMES CAMERON or JOHN McTIERNAN (John directed the first film.).  BOTTOM LINE: See the original first, if you liked that one, which you should or you are strange, then try this one- but don't have high expectations.""- MJV & the Movies.",992908800,,2339,4.624697336561743

386021,4,6301963725,"In this second version of that Predator, the context is more important than the creature, and definitely more important than in the first Predator. He appears in Los Angeles, hence in a city. But the local cops run against the FBI or something like that, because, the federal services, probably the armed forces, want to capture him since he is an extra-terrestrial, an alien. This creates a conflict with the local police and particularly a black cop who has a reputation of violence though also of effectiveness. He is a pistolero that captures criminals when he can, and reduces them when he so decides. Better though, this predator is only one of a whole colony of aliens who are living underground in Los Angeles, in their buried spaceship that looks like some arabian or slavonic palace. The cop manages to follow the alien down into this spaceship and hence is able to see his  colleagues  coming to retrieve his body after he has been killed by the cop, and at the same time deprived of his detonator by cutting off his right arm, so that he cannot blow up the whole city when he knows he is going to die. This film hence uses many models coming from other works of imagination, fiction or other films : Alien and Aliens of course, Hellraiser by Clive Barker and the sequels, but also The Tommyknockers by Stephen King. That enriches the subject with references to other cultural products and it makes it more interesting to watch because of the patterns that appear in the film and the variations we can notice. Let me give one : the treatment of the bodies of the victims by this alien can look like the treatment of some victims of tClive Barker's Cenobites, but more with the only objective, the primitive objective of killing, destroying and than of making the victims suffer in any way. This is contrasted to the treatment of some of the victims of the drug lords in the same film where the objective is to torture in order to satisfy some basic perverted instinct. This alien is nothing but a hunter and not a torturer. The people who don't like slightly gory situations must try to avoid meeting this predator.

386022,5,6301963725,"Predator 2 is a misunderstood and crimnally underrated sequel to Predator. It not only equals it's predesscessor, but also surpasses it in a few categories. Alan Silvestri's mind-blowing score from Predator 1 is improved on the 0-10 scale by 11. Stephen Hopkins' direction is excellent and gives P2 a very special and hard-worked feel to it. The Cinematography is awesome and makes the film scary and unpredictable. The action sequences are also Grade A+. The breath-taking shootout at the beginning, the Train confrontation, and the final Battle. Wow! P2 combines the intense action of P1 and amps it up to eleven. The action sequences are even more though-out and better than those of P1. The acting is brilliant too. Danny Glover makes a great Hero as Harrigan and has one of his best roles ever. He makes Harrigan a likeable character that you'll root for all the way too the end. The level of violence and gore is also a LOT higher than the original's and any gore-hound will be in Heaven with this. I also must say that P2's settings and story are brilliant to the max. A crime-  infested Los Angeles was the perfect spot for him to continue his Rampage and all of the sets, from the Meat Factory, Predator Ship and ""shot-out"" Buildings are mind-blowing.  Predator 2 is all in all an excellent Grade A+ sequel that pretty much improves over the original Predator. I REALLY hope this review will give this underrated  masterpiece a much better reputation.

386023,5,6301963725,"'Silent, Invisible, Invincible. He's in town with a few days to kill.' Has there ever a tagline cooler than this? I'm telling you there hasn't. Long, long, long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves. Why all of a sudden? Because when standing next to the extremely crap AvP, it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie was not in it. Fair enough, a Terminator, Conan or even Commando film without Arnie just wouldn't work. But the 7-foot tall, Rastafarian, otherworldly hunter is the star of this film and this time round he gets much, much more screen time. We all know what the Predator is so Stephen Hopkins shows off this ace instead of hiding it up his sleeve.

The year is 1997 and the City of Angels is boiling under a 109-degree heatwave. Columbian and Jamaican drug lords have turned the streets into a war-zone. The police are out-manned and out gunned and incompetent. The last thing they need to deal with is the Predator.

The titular hunter has returned with an increased arsenal of weapons and is keen on slicing and dicing the aforementioned druggies for fun. During a brutal gun-battle on the streets he watches Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), a slightly-crazed renegade cop, blow away half a dozen Columbian scumbags and chooses him as his ultimate prey. Naturally, Harrigan and his ethnically diverse team of cops have enough problems without having to worry about their skulls ending up in the Pred's intergalactic trophy cabinet.

Making matters worse is faux-DEA Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) who pretends to be after the druggies but is really more interested in swiping the Pred's advanced technology. Yeah, good luck with that! From start to finish Predator 2 is brash, unsubtle, in-your-face wall-to-wall action. A hectic, breathtaking succession of non-stop, increasingly exciting set-pieces. The final 45 minutes will you wetting yourself with excitement I kid you not. While Hopkins (fresh from his Nightmare on Elm Street 5 debut) has remained constantly employed he's never really become a star director, which is a shame since he has a slick, cartoonish style and is far more talented than most other anonymous directors. Like John McTiernan did in the first, he provokes a dusty, sweaty and overbearingly hot atmosphere in the daytime scenes and an alien, Gothic feel to night (pun intended). The way he captures LA on film just makes you NEVER want to go there.

Fans of Alan Silvestri's score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back (they were rudely ditched for AvP) and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums, sinister, shrieking, Hermann-esquire strings, yawning, haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.

But it ain't just that. Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing mass-produced or conveyor-belt about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.

It's sad that action films like this are not made anymore. Predator 2 is a classic, the kind of movie that feels torn straight from the pages of a 1950's pulp detective novel and crossed with a Twilight Zone episode. 10/10, no doubt.

This Blu Ray looks and sounds brilliant.",969926400,21,3662,4.964110929853181
386074,1,6301963725,"Loved the first film.  Why does this one fail?  First, I don't have the video game or boxer shorts or bedsheets with the predator on them.  I mean, it's a cool creature.  But a cool creature in a dumb movie is still a cool  creature in a dumb movie.
Danny Glover?  C'mon.  He's no Arnold.  Are  they going to have Pauly Shore fight the Predator in the next installment?  His character is written as one the Oprah Nation would dub a 'rageaholic'.  He is irrational-says one thing, does the opposite, gets mad @ people  without having a real reason, and basically does his best to become Dirty  Harry.  He ain't Clint Eastwood, either.  He gives Bill Paxton a speech  about being a team player, yet every chance he gets, Glover goes 'off'.
Maria Conchita Alonso's accent or maybe audio make it hard to  distinguish what she says.  Paxton-cardboard cop.  Stock player as Glover's  friend is charismatic as wilted lettuce and script impedes any real acting,  anyway.  When he dies, it's just the 'latino guy' who dies because you  never get the sense he was a person in this film unlike the first film with  its characters.
Opening gunbattle?  Ridiculous.  I grew up in LA and  saw live coverage of LAPD's gunbattle with SLA.  Since then, the LAPD has a  model seige unit, with modern procedures.  The movie cops fight like they  were drunken cowboys instead of professionals trained in the art of urban  warfare.  Also-you notice something?  NO airsupport.  The LAPD has plenty  of air support and snipers, but you don't see these @ start because that  wouldn't let Glover show his 'bad boy cred' by shooting it out.  I  mean-C'MON.  IN LA, in certain parts, you constantly hear police choppers  overhead and these choppers deposit Gary Busey's technicians, but they  can't fly over and drop teargas or use snipers-which LAPD have in  abundance?  I mean, it IS a movie, but give us some credit.
The  creature's face looks cartoony in this one.  Also, why would the creature,  so-called great hunter, not notice Glover in car following?  THIS is a  great hunter?  The gangland subplot?  Flat.  Glover?  Toe to Toe with the  beast that beat Arnold like a Red-headed stepchild?
I could swallow all  the implausibility, the plot holes, the overwritten characters (glover),  the underwritten characters(the dead latino cop)-but that would take more  beer than I can possibly drink and more faith than is available in the  world's largest cathedral.
A sequel's sequel.  A waste of time.  The  predator from the first film is turning over in his grave.",963792000,13,2542,4.785547785547785

386077,4,6301963725,"I really enjoyed watching the original Predator (I have seen it more than 5 times) so I was hoping that Predator 2 would offer some of the same action and suspense as the first movie. Overall, I was not disappointed,  although Predator 2 is not as good as its precursor.
This time the  Predator is in the city and hunting down drug lords and gang members all  over the place. Danny Glover, playing a local police officer, becomes  suspicious about the numerous deaths and skinned corpses. He is further  intrigued by the presence of a secret government task force that is always  hanging around at the crime scenes (led by Gary Busey). As you can probably  guess, the Predator has been wreaking havoc around the city and is prepared  to face off against anybody -- and that's exactly what happens.
The  movie includes many of the elements that made the original Predator so  successful. The haunting music, the eerie suspense that comes when viewing  the crime scenes through the eyes of the Predator, and more. The story, in  my opinion, is a little more far-fetched than the original (especially the  ending). Setting the movie in the city instead of the jungle also tends to  lessen the suspense and drama.
Although it may not be a great movie,  Predator 2 is one of the best sequels I have seen for any movie and is  worthwhile viewing. It may not be of the same calibre as the original  classic, but it comes close.",958953600,4,1420,4.5936254980079685

7817621,5,6301963725,"Predator 2 is so underrated it's ridiculous. The original is a classic but Predator 2 is even better. Danny Glover is fantastic in probably his best performance. He makes for an even better, more intense, more interesting and more complex hero than Schwarzenegger in the original. Gary Busey and Bill Paxton are also fantastic. They are really underrated actors. This film is a real treat because it reminds us that we don't get action films like this anymore and most likely never will again. It's really hardcore, insanely violent, thrilling from start to finish and has an even better Predator creature than the first film. The pacing in this film is masterful. It's great that it finally got it's well deserved cult status but it deserves more than that. It's such a great action film. If you've never seen Predator 2 due to inexplicable negative word of mouth or because Schwarzenegger isn't in it (yes I've actually heard that from people as their reason for not liking the film or giving it a shot) then you owe it to yourself to give it a shot especially to be treated to a rare action picture that you will most likely never see again. It's thoroughly exciting.",1526169600,,1170,4.712195121951219
7817622,4,6301963725,"""Predator 2"" is a solid if not spectacular follow up to the great 1987 actioner starring Arnold Schwartzenegger. Taking place in LA, and starring the dependable Danny Glover as an overwhelmed cop fighting heavily armed drug gangs. He and his team consisting of Ruben Blades, Maris Conchita Alonzo, and the late and sorely missed Bill Pullman. notice something is amiss when one of the rival drug gangs is mutilated by, obviously, someone other than another gang. He really suspects something is off when Gary Busey shows up with government credentials and tells him to back off the case. The story takes a bit of time before it gets to the action but once it does, the film delivers the goods and then some. All in all a solid effort by all invovled. Good performences, tight direction by Stphen Hopkins (""Blown Away"", ""The Ghost and the Darkness"") and a silid script by ""Predator"" writers Jim and John Thomas.",1526169600,,910,4.802547770700637

7817626,5,6301963725,"I can remember when this came out 28 years ago and how highly excited I was as big a fan as I came to be for the past couple of years.  Unfortunately, I was too young to see it in theaters so I had to wait for it to come out on VHS.  Well needless to say, several months later when this month hit the video stores in my town, I can remember how the local Mom and Pop store didn't have enough copies for the first 2 weeks of its VHS release and how disappointing that was.  Well come 3 weeks past I was delighted to be finally be able to find a copy to rent and I couldn't have been more on cloud nine.  As for the movie itself well it totally blew me away in how it more than met my expectations.

So at any rate, this sequel boasted so much to make any great action buff more than satisfied.

Let's start with the action:
-The explosive non-stop action was in ample supply right from the beginning whatwith all the hard hitting action going on right at the brutal shootouts between the local Columbian drug dealers and the Jamaican Voodoo cult led by King Willie.
-Once Officer Mike Harrigan(Danny Glover), Danny boy(Rueben Blades), and Leona(Maria Conchita Alonso) get into the fight the action truly kicks into gear.
-The new Predator is even more vicious as this one still has the shoulder mounted cannon, infrared vision, mirage-like camouflage, 3 dot laser pointer, and sharp blades on its metal cuff, but also some new weapons including a long, retractable spear, a laser pistol right by its cuff blades, a much improved voice recorder and greater ability to repeat what it hears, and finally a disc-shaped boomerang with sharp blades.  Everyone of those weapons allows for greater action and a much more menacing Predator than previously.

The cast was a win-win with Danny Glover)Lethal Weapon's 1-4), Rueben Blades(Color of Night), the late and super awesome Bill Paxton(Aliens, Twister, The Terminator), sexy Maria Conchita Alonso(Moscow on the Hudson, Colors, The Lords of Salem), plus a great cameo by Mother Superior herself, Lilyan Chauvin.  Danny Glover proved a slick oldschool cop driven by sensibility and tact, Rueben Blades even as his appearance was short he came off very cunning and a great partner match to Danny Glover, Bill Paxton was really awesome as always with his high energy, cool one-liners, plus he was great and very welcomed comic relief, Maria Conchita Alonso while underplaying her comedic side and also her sex appeal she still put in a great performance and showed excellent chemistry with Danny, Rueben, and Bill.  As for Lilyan Chauvin(Silent Night, Deadly Night), for her short appearance she was interesting and really good.",1524009600,,2669,4.745140388768898

7817629,4,6301963725,"While I'm sure my opinion of Predator 2 is heavily influenced by nostalgia(I was 16 when it came out), watching it again feels like going back to a truly different time.  The effects are almost entirely practical and the craftsmanship that went into the predator's look and arsenal are aspects we will never again see in a modern movie.  While this doesn't up the ante anywhere near as much as Terminator 2, it's clear that the producers took the material seriously and made an above-average effort to deliver a worthwhile sequel.

Unfortunately what stood out about this movie above all else was the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't even make a cameo in it.  Danny Glover, Gary Busey and Bill Paxton star in Predator 2 and they are all better actors but they just can't match the presence of Ahnuld in his prime.  Something else I noticed were the gang banger villains in the opening sequence pop up and shoot from cover like an arcade light gun shooter I played back then.  Whether it was intentional or not, it brought to mind the ""one man army"" nature of 80s action movies.

Still worth a watch and I'm sure even today's teenagers will appreciate the spectacle of Predator 2.",1523059200,,1186,4.673076923076923
