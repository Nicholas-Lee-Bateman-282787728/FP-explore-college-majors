6132283,2,B00H4WGHFY,"If you're looking for a series on biblical archaeology, this is not the video series for you. I've watched 2 hours of this series and they spend very little time on the actual archaeological findings. They seem more content to bring in commentators to make opinionated statements, and very little in the way of evidence. They spend about 15% of their time actually analyzing anything of a historic nature before taking the rest of the episode to make grandiose predictions or assumptions. Which is frustrating because they leave a lot of questions about the archaeological findings unanswered. It just leaves me feeling like they're walking on egg shells, and they really softball the analysis, almost feels like they're afraid that their archaeological assumptions won't stand up to critical questioning. Feels more like a bunch of pastors preaching to the choir than a gritty examination of the facts. This series was an excellent idea that was very poorly executed... and I say that as a lifelong christian.

For example: During the first episode, they make a fantastical claim that they've found remnants of the sodom and gomorrah destruction, even finding bodies encased in sulfur. They bring in a pastor who says ""trust me, I've spent a lot of years looking at chemistry..."". End scientific testing... then they run with that as the final say, which is quaint, but don't be lazy, put that notion up for some critical analysis. I want to see something on the chemistry of sulfur and how that would happen... but it never happens. I'm not saying they have to bring in an atheist to debate their conclusions, but at least TRY to test out your conclusion.",1426896000,6,1657,4.917857142857143

6132291,5,B00H4WGHFY,"I am the Author of an End times warning book and I cant stand to watch a faithless based Christian mockumentary. If you are tired of people trying to explain away God's miracles with ridiculous scenarios, then these are just what you want. Real life evidence of the actual events mentioned in the Bible that the mainstream producers will never show you. These are great.
Sincerely,
Charles Mesic",1405209600,16,395,4.823529411764706

8630016,5,B00H4WGHFY,I found this series to be very informative. I have an extensive library of books and videos on the the subject of Christianity and I strongly recommend this one for any person or group of people studying the Bible. It is clear and concise. I find it worthy to mention you can follow along with your Bible in hand if you so desire for comparison.,1458432000,3,345,4.323076923076923
