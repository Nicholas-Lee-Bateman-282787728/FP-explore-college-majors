8511312,5,B0076YFJ3G,SO creepy!  The plot just keeps unfolding and unfolding and getting more and more creepy until the end where I'll just say I'm sleeping with the light on tonight.  Don't watch this alone unless you really like scary ghost stories and being terrified.,1383177600,,250,4.790697674418604
8511313,4,B0076YFJ3G,"Totally creepy!  The Surgeon keeps the suspense in the air, as the women try to solve their dilemma before their time arrives. Saw-style greatness here.  I found myself really into this, I'm pretty sure at one point I was staring at the screen open mouthed for at least 20 minutes straight as I waited for the Surgeon to come kill some poor girl.",1368316800,,346,4.476190476190476

8511315,4,B0076YFJ3G,This movie reminded me of the Hostel series which is definitely a good thing and it made me squirm in my chair more than a few times. Not your run of the mill horror flick.,1361145600,,172,3.942857142857143
8511316,1,B0076YFJ3G,"Yes, this is a sordid piece of torture porn.

I won't rehash the plot much, as other reviewers have done so.

BANE was marketed as ""science fiction."" I say this, because I saw it playing on a sci-fi cable channel. I don't know how much of BANE they censored, because I'd earlier seen the film on DVD, and didn't watch it on that sci-fi channel.

But it's a pretty bloody film, so they must have censored some of it.

One reviewer praised BANE for not relying on nudity. Well, no. While BANE is not quite hardcore porn, there's much softcore porn, including shower scenes.

BANE is torture porn. Four women wake up in a futuristic prison, and are periodically taken off to be tortured and/or killed. There's also a ""surprise twist"" ending, where we learn the details of this post-apocalyptic world, and why the women are in prison. This revelation is not especially interesting, and certainly not ""satisfying"" as one reviewer put it.

BANE tries to compensate for its misogyny by making the surviving women turn out to be a tough, Lara Croft type super-heroine. Seems she too can kill with gusto.

So BANE is essentially about a bunch of women who are mercilessly tortured and killed for no good reason, balanced by one of the women getting in some bloody-thirsty jabs as well.

Science fiction, like horror, benefits from a ""sense of wonder."" THE RING, THE GRUDGE, and JEEPERS CREEPERS -- even HALLOWEEN -- all had a ""sense of wonder,"" in that the protagonists were confronted with dark powers greater than themselves. (People forget that Myers's indestructibility was shocking and surprising in 1978, before indestructible slashers became a clich.)

BANE has no ""sense of wonder."" Nor does its ""suspense"" rely on mysterious, intriguing characters (e.g. PSYCHO). Instead, BANE is sordid torture porn, with a (sorta) sordid torture revenge ending.

Brain-dead trash.",1338422400,2,1865,4.948717948717949
8511317,5,B0076YFJ3G,"Bane is a vey original Horror film, with a cool story I would recommend this to any horror fan, enough said watch this film it's awesome!",1335398400,,137,4.3076923076923075
8511318,3,B0076YFJ3G,"BANE ,Alittle `SAW' & a tad `H P LOVECRAFT' this is a movie with some stuff to Frighten !

So these ladies may have been kidnapped,That's pretty bad news.

Some medical types are experimenting with/on them...Not good.

Is that a
Cthulhu alien ???

So,These factors are unsettling and then they get a `Time To Die' carved into their bodies.

There is alot going on and the title BANE was never explained to our satisfaction,Were the producers playing off the release of new BATMAN film with the villian, BANE or is it the explaination of the word -a person or thing that ruins or spoils.",1332460800,,586,4.596153846153846
