8122142,5,B000FGFUIG,"The best price you can find! So happy I got these! A week later there does seem to be less roaches and spiders. My parcel came the next day as promised and I set up near my front door. Because of insects problem, I have this plugged in my hallway and my bedroom.  If I need more I will definitely but again.",1510099200,,307,3.9516129032258065
8122143,5,B000FGFUIG,"Use this for classes for dads who are ""expecting,""  You won't stop laughing.  Great for first time daddies or sons-in-law who anticipate becoming first time dads.",1396569600,,162,5.1923076923076925
8122144,2,B000FGFUIG,"I rented this for my husband in the hopes that it would be an enlightening and lighthearted take on the expectant father. It was so cheestastic that we fast forwarded through most of it.
Also, the most important part, labor and delivery, was not included on the download. That's the part I wanted to learn about the most.",1372032000,,321,4.551724137931035
8122145,1,B000FGFUIG,"I ordered this DVD after reading reviews that stated that it was funny and informative. My husband and I sat down to watch this DVD, as we are expecting our first child. We were unable to complete even the first section of the film due to the poor quality. To be specific, the production quality was extremely poor and seemed more like someone's home video. The two men who provide the information throughout the video were not remotely comedic, although many, many attempts at humor were made. It was outright cheesy and difficult to watch without wincing. It was a painful viewing experience for us both. If you need a parenting video, I would recommend that you look to something like the Laugh and Learn series, which offer DVDs on childbirth, breastfeeding, and newborn care by a qualified professional and a mother.",1342569600,,821,4.788732394366197
8122146,5,B000FGFUIG,"My wife and I had a lot of fun watching this together. No, you won't find a lot of medical talk, but chances are you are already inundated with those classes, books and DVDs anyway. This DVD will help you relax. It will give you pointers on what to expect and how to consistently remain a thoughtful, accommodating, and caring mate during what can be a hectic, intimidating time. You may not laugh all the way through--that's not their goal--but you will be entertained and you will definitely gain some valuable knowledge. The guys share some of their own experiences, including some of their mistakes.

This DVD is made for (future) dads, but can be enjoyed by everyone. It's obvious the hosts are dedicated husbands and fathers and that they have a true desire to share what they've learned. You will likely want to watch it more than once.

Enjoy and all the best!",1282780800,,868,4.62987012987013
8122147,5,B000FGFUIG,After watching this DVD for the first time with my husband we were amazed at what we learned as first time parents. We definitly recommend this to all first time fathers and others that think they know everything!,1156118400,,213,4.631578947368421
8122148,4,B000FGFUIG,My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It was funny and certainly conveyed important points in a way that seemed to get through to my husband.  It's the best thing we've found that is directed towards dads and it does a great job of reaching that audience.,1155686400,2,256,4.425531914893617
8122149,1,B000FGFUIG,"This feature is labled a comedy, but I thought there might be some good information here to help new dads.  The comedy is pretty bad and the two actors spend more time trying to be funny than they do informing new dads.  The sum total of valuable information could be condensed into about 5-10 minutes.",1155340800,3,302,4.472727272727273
8122150,5,B000FGFUIG,"The only fun, humorous and educational media available.  Unfortunately this was not available when I was pregnant with my first.  Instead, my husband, in trying to understand and sympathize with me, read parts of my Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy.  Not only did he not understand many of the jokes, he was genuinely confused about many subjects!  This is the perfect solution. It helps men to understand the physical and emotional phases of pregnancy while being funny.  An absolute must for all expectant fathers.",1154563200,2,514,5.144578313253012
