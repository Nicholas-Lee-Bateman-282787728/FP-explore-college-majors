5948544,4,B00EVU3SX6,Fire over England is my favorite Vivien Leigh movie now.,1408233600,,56,4.7
5948545,4,B00EVU3SX6,"Although overall I am quite pleased with the set, I am a bit disappointed in the presentation of one of the films, St. Martin's Lane.

The aspect ratio for St. Martin's Lane is quite off, as evidenced in the opening credits.  The left side of the screen cuts off the names.  (Not so with my unrestored Kino version. The framing by Kino is much better.)  I would imagine the rest of SML is also mastered in this same aspect ratio, too, which is a shame considering the print itself looks fantastic.

Also, the credits on Fire Over England look to be quite a hodge-podge compilation of different prints, although the film itself looks spectacular.",1405555200,,645,4.62280701754386
5948546,5,B00EVU3SX6,"It's certainly a well known fact that Vivien Leigh is both beautiful and talented. Unfortunately all we fans ever get to see of her is as Scarlett or Blanche DuBois or maybe Cleopatra. This four movie package of her earlier works is simply wonderful. Thanks to the fantastic restoration process that was done we get to see and hear this exquisite beauty as never before. Oh thank you,thank you,thank you!",1399680000,11,404,4.785714285714286
5948547,4,B00EVU3SX6,"Iconic actors and actresses aren't ""born"" out of the basics of cinema. They pay their dues, delve into and out of possible personas and production typecasts. They take risks and resort to the common and comfortable when said experiments yield insignificant resultsor worse, outright industry and fan backlash. The Vivien Leigh Anniversary Collection may contain the role that convinced David O. Selznick to give the fledgling Brit a shot at Scarlett O'Hara (Fire Over England) but for the most part, it's an overview of opening volleys, a unique if often staid insight into how a beautiful ingnue is twisted and turned into something either bankable or broken. It was within these trenches where Leigh learned the ropes, established one of her more meaningful relationships (with Olivier, who she was with for over 20 years) and developed the chops that would lead to other award winning work.

Of the four films offered, Storm in a Teacup is the only true ""comedy,"" but it's very dated and more farce-like than the screwball hits that were coming out of Hollywood at the time. The notion of a politician petitioning to have a friendly looking dog ""put down"" because of unpaid license fees might seem a tad intense, but everyone here plays the folly likes its fool's gold. This is probably because the entire cast is on their best behavior, turning otherwise banal banter into charming, fluffy fun. Something similar happens with St. Martin's Lane, but it's not because of our storied star. Instead, Charles Laughton walks away with this film as the struggling busker who falls for Leigh's air-headed harpy despite himself. It's sad that this incredibly talented star is shuttled aside midway through the movie for more Harrison and Leigh cow eyes, but when he returns to the dramatic fray, his impact is immediate and welcome.

As for the famed Fire Over England, it's pure period piece politeness, the kind of movie you expect from the setting, the storyline, and the staging. It's like watching a ponderous play come to life, with only the acting available to save you from substandard entertainment elements. Leigh is electrifying, but mostly because she has such amazing chemistry with her future husband. It's telling that the film's other romantic leadTamara Desni as Elena, a Spanish lasscan't hold a candle to what Leigh offers when she is with Olivier, though our Hispanic Miss is more or less the third piece of this proposed romantic triangle. All English accents aside, the international thriller aspects of Dark Journey, though incredibly muted by today's slam-bang standards, are still fun to watch unfurl. Leigh is excellent, though a tad unbelievable, as the double crossing double agent, while Veidt goes a good job of delivering a darkness the story surely needs.

One thing is certain: Vivien Leigh was always destined to be a star. She is often bigger than the characters or her surrounding actors, generating a kind of ethereal presence that's rare in film. She's not always greather work in St. Martin's Lane alone can attest to thatbut she's dynamic and her visage definitely draws you in. For fans of the woman and her work, you can consider these films building blocks, foundational turns that traded on her devastating beauty while digging beneath the surface to find the substance within. While Leigh was always touted as being a beauty first, a talent second, these films arguing against such a superficial assessment. As with any young performer, the future Oscar winner is finding her footing here. She had already established her stage credentials. With the four films provided here, we see the warm up to work that would come to define who Leigh was, and how we think of her today.

From a technical standpoint, these are old, mostly forgotten films, so this Anniversary Collection deserves kudos for finding such excellent examples of each. All are presented in a pre-widescreen 1.33:1 anamorphic image, and for the most part, the monochrome is clean and crisp. You have to remember that most of these movies were found in deplorable states, and that Milestone and Cohen (with the help of the British Film Institute) went about remastering these prints as best as possible. Sure, there are differences in clarity, grain, contrast, and the occasional flaw, but when you consider that these films are nearly 80 years old, they don't look half bad. On the sound side of things, well, there's not much you can do with tinny, think Mono mixes, no matter how you gussy them up. At least the four offerings here are relatively hiss-free and lack significant distortion.

As for added content, none of the films themselves inspired bonus features. Over the course of the two disc presentation we are treated to only one significant bit of added content: a 25 minute interview with one of Leigh's many biographers, Anne Edwards. Focusing on her life before Hollywood, it's an interesting personal and professional overview.

5948548,5,B00EVU3SX6,This set is a must have for Vivien Leigh fans. Previously there have only been muddy sub zero prints of these pre Gone With The Wind Leigh films. The BFI has done wonderful restoration work on these movies-one can sit back and enjoy Vivien Leigh's versatility in four very different roles.,1388534400,12,289,4.686274509803922
5948549,5,B00EVU3SX6,"From her first pairing with Laurence Olivier in Fire Over England to her turn as an ambitious street performer in Sidewalks of London/St. Martin's Lane, it's fascinating watching Vivien Leigh develop as a screen actress in these early films for Alexander Korda.

Although all four of these titles have been released on DVD before (see the AMC boxed set that came out about 10 years ago), they were in dire need of restoration. The Cohen Film Collection stepped up to the challenge and has come through with flying colours. I had the pleasure of seeing the newly restored prints on the big screen at the BFI in London as part of their Vivien Leigh retrospective earlier this month. The picture and sound quality are really top-notch. It's like watching completely different films from what was previously available.

Bonus: the Blu-ray set is region-free, so you can watch it no matter where you live.",1384905600,50,900,4.875816993464053
8609917,4,B00EVU3SX6,"I ha've nothing to add to the previous good reviews of this set.  The video is very good and far superior to the AMC set with the same 4 movies.  However, there is a problem with the audio level being way way too high.  In the case of St. Martin's Lane in particular, the sound gets quite distorted and honky to my ears.  You'll hear this in the very first street scene where the woman's singing voice is very hard to listen to.
Addendum:  my comments were about the DVD version, not the blu ray version.",1494028800,,504,4.208333333333333
8609918,5,B00EVU3SX6,"Although I enjoy every film with Vivien Leigh, oh how I wish that THE DEEP BLUE SEA would be released.  Why has this film totally disappeared and is rarely if ever mentioned.  I saw it when it was first released and enjoyed it very much.  Finding and releasing this film on DVD would be real present to all those who enjoy CLASSIC films.",1474329600,,337,4.317460317460317
8609919,5,B00EVU3SX6,Loove Viivien - a fantastic collection,1458518400,,38,5.5
8609920,5,B00EVU3SX6,Scarlett in the making certainly i sidewalks kof London in a role totally redolent of Scarlet. Curiously 21 Daysxwas missing but the disc are fine and the transfers good.,1443398400,,170,4.896551724137931
8609921,5,B00EVU3SX6,Great collection of Vivien's early screen work. I'd like to see A Yank at Oxford restored and available on Blu-Ray. The Anne Edwards commentary is delightful!,1441238400,,158,5.115384615384615
8609922,5,B00EVU3SX6,"The print quality of these films in the anniversary collection far surpasses that of AMC Movies' ""Vivien Leigh Classics.""  Never has ""Dark Journey"" (1938) looked so good!  Charles Laughton steals the show in ""St. Martin's Lane,"" but that's all right---it's the film that got Viv noticed by Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, ultimately landing her the Scarlett O'Hara role---and the rest is history.  What we have in this collection is a delightful bit of, er, PRE-history.",1437696000,3,476,5.2368421052631575
8609923,5,B00EVU3SX6,"The movies themselves, though very well restored, are not much but for Vivien aficionados they are a very valuable contribution. Besides, she is so beautiful that I doubt anybody is paying attention to what is going on in the screen.",1426809600,,233,4.85
8609924,5,B00EVU3SX6,"These were wonderful old films, with an excellent remastering.  It was a great opportunity to see this great actress in roles before Hollywood discovered her, in well written films with such co-stars as Lawrence Olivier, Flora Robson, James Mason, Robert Newton and Rex Harrison all in early roles in their careers, as well as with Charles Laughton during the peak of his career.",1425254400,,379,5.015873015873016
8609925,3,B00EVU3SX6,"Two of the movies are ok and two of them are lame. None of them show any real promise in terms of the acting ability of the V. Leigh, so that must have come more in focus after she left europe and came to california...",1421020800,,218,3.8666666666666667
8609926,4,B00EVU3SX6,"So happy to see these early films restored. Ms. Leigh was an exceptional actress and its a blessing to have been to view again. These are well filmed, if not great films.  They are worth a place in anyone's film library.",1408492800,,220,4.365853658536586
