8021943,4,B00023XHW8,"I liked this one a lot, defiantly above average for a goofy 70s T&A flick, it is actually funny, and has some nice racks,not a ton of nudity, but enough, it has a good pace, and a coherent story line, nice transfer, thumbs up",1289001600,5,225,4.136363636363637
8021944,3,B00023XHW8,"Three star rating for this piece of semi-humorous 70's sleaze. According to Amazon's rating system three stars = ""It's okay"", which is exactly how I feel about it.

The print looks good enough for this type of product, although it's fullscreen so the presentation could be better in my opinion.

The real reason I bought this is Uschi Digard. And have no fear, she shows off the two things shes best known for in this seedy flick. The ""plot"" also involves dirty minded truckers which I personally find amusing.

Dont pay too much for it and you should be satisfied...",1260144000,7,567,4.65
