8661083,4,B00KRW4MXM,"In Japanese with English subtitles.  I thought it was going to be in English and bought this for my disabled son, who cannot read.  It should be marked as subtitled.",1437609600,3,165,4.466666666666667
8661084,4,B00KRW4MXM,"Decided to save $10 and go with the DVD version for the 2nd volume instead of the Blu-ray route and regret it. Didn't think there would be that much difference between the 2 formats since this was animation. The subtitles look craptastic and there is a noticeable difference in quality both color wise and image wise. I'm not saying the overall quality of the dvd was poor in so much as the quality of the blu-ray is simply outstanding. I still love the story being a huge fan of the original, but I will continue to buy the rest of the series on blu-ray from here on out.",1423180800,,572,4.305555555555555
