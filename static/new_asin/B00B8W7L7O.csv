5563471,5,B00B8W7L7O,"Watching George ""Spanky"" McCurdy unpack many of the dynamics of his playing techniques alternating between on time grooves played out of time in this DVD, I believe is enough to inspire all levels of drummers. The resources provided on the DVD and play along tracks which are downloadable to your Mac/or PC are definitely added perks. i am very pleased to have added this drum instructional DVD to my collection.",1371772800,2,412,4.9
5563472,1,B00B8W7L7O,"I have to say it has been a very disappointing experience.  The dvd is entitled off time/ on time.  McCurdy shows numerous examples of odd time, switching time, partial paraddidle or how the one count can be on the two, three or four.  What is astonishing to me is that McCurdy never counts or explains where the one is as he plays through the vast array of examples.  How can you make a dvd entitled off time/on time and not once count out what you are playing or talk about note value?  He basically talks about the philosophy  behind the example and tells the audience to ""check it out"" then plays an example with no explanation of what he's playing as he plays it or after he plays it.  Then he proceeds to the next example and does more of the same.  I think there are some great ideas here, but he does a poor job in conveying these ideas to the audience.",1371772800,9,861,4.2392638036809815
5563473,5,B00B8W7L7O,This product has helped my playing tremendously!  Especially with timing and counting. The tracks are sick and the attention to detail is exceptional!,1370822400,,150,5.521739130434782

5563476,5,B00B8W7L7O,"Great DVD for advanced drummers looking for a few new ideas.

Not ideal for beginners as a good grasp of the basic is essential before grasping many of the concepts in this video.",1369785600,,179,4.424242424242424
5563477,4,B00B8W7L7O,"He's got a really simple way of explaining what he's doing, and you can really see yourself doing it all in a short space of time... The challenge, as always, is application to your own music. The whole point is to be yourself after all of it!",1369612800,,243,4.191489361702128
5563478,5,B00B8W7L7O,Definitely makes off time drumming easier to understand.  Mostly enjoy the parts with him playing along to a track.  Great DVD,1369180800,2,126,4.9523809523809526
5563479,5,B00B8W7L7O,The off time/on time dvd is a great buy. I have been a fan of Spanky since the 'Life' CD wit Tye. He gives great instruction and breaks down everything very clearly. The first 20 mins of the dvd alone is enough to have a drummer work out on to get down pat. Good job! Looking forward to the next one!,1368576000,2,300,3.9344262295081966
5563480,5,B00B8W7L7O,"It is about time that Hudson began putting out videos that appeal to other demographics of drummers. Spanky is a legend to our generation, a trendsetter both behind the kit, and in front of it. This is a great buy!!",1368230400,2,215,4.4
5563481,5,B00B8W7L7O,"This educational DVD is absolutely insightful! He demonstrated various ways to turn a pattern into an odd-time phrase by extending it over. He is definitely not the best teacher explaining verbally (a lot of the odd-time phrasing concepts he talked about are still hard to understand without looking at the provided drum score), but his demonstration is very tight and versatile.

Looking forward to more educational DVD like this.",1384992000,,431,5.246376811594203
5563482,5,B00B8W7L7O,awesome DVD! this DVD was everything I asked for and some!  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their vocabulary on the drumset!,1383091200,,141,4.64

5563485,5,B00B8W7L7O,Funky- focused- entertaining- fun- inspiring - musical - interesting- slick- great play-along tracks- great ideas - lots of great material..,1375660800,,140,6.05
5563486,5,B00B8W7L7O,I have watched the Dvd many times now since it has arrived and I have enjoyed and learned quite a bit. I enjoyed the way that Spanky broke down every concept and even included the tracks that he played on his dvd as giveaways... that's something you don't see everyday. Great Job. I would recommend buying this DVD.,1374451200,,315,4.448275862068965
5563487,5,B00B8W7L7O,"Very smart, and funny  Drums Tutorial, but the Drummer is an Amazing Player. I have enjoyed very much, Thank you Spanky",1373846400,,119,4.666666666666667
5563488,5,B00B8W7L7O,"Excellent motivational video for any generation of drummers, especially the 90s and new millennium babies. Having a great since of time is key to being a working drummer.",1372982400,,170,5.107142857142857
5563489,2,B00B8W7L7O,"Spanky is a monster player and hugely successful; nobody is denying that.  However, the dude is naturally gifted and fails to explain much about his tricks and methods.  I love his playing... the whole cd skip/echo/all that other gospel stuff is great.  I just have so many unanswered questions about them.  Ah well.  The DVD is good, and chock full of Spanky shedding, but I didn't take much away from it that I couldn't take away from finding his performance clips on youtube.  Worth a watch, but not a huge investment of time.",1372377600,,529,4.634408602150538
5563490,3,B00B8W7L7O,"When is Hudson Music going to do a DVD with someone actually super rad like Chris Dave, Thomas Pridgen, Daru Jones or something?? This DVD was ok but man, most of it is BS you would never want to listen to unless your a drummer. This doesnt help you grow as a musician, it helps you lose the gig for real.",1371945600,,305,4.016393442622951
8564293,2,B00B8W7L7O,"The material in this package was not taught/conveyed well... it was not broken down well.  I was not able to learn much from this dvd.  I don't think Spanky taught the material very well.

(I have been drumming for the past two years (pedagogically for the past year))  As an aside, I recommend Tommy Igoe's Groove Essentials 1 and 2.",1483574400,,334,4.516666666666667
8564294,4,B00B8W7L7O,Like It......,1456963200,,13,6.0
8564295,3,B00B8W7L7O,"Good news and bad news.  The good news is that this dvd by Spanky is a good video because it is well produced and touches on a very unique way of expressing drum talent.  The talent that he is an expert in is this well developed offbeat, offtime playing style.  The bad news is that it is another drum video by an excellent drummer that doesn't really teach.  Spanky clearly knows what he is doing and is very good at it. He tells and shows you what he is doing. There just isn't much slowing down in the tempo to actually get or digest what he is doing. There is pdfs if you know how to read drum music.  But unless you can follow or understand this type of drum style, it is another drum video showcasing an excellent drummer showing off his stuff.  This is the kind of playing that a drummer could use if he or she wants to show off at a drum off in an 'everybody's got talent' show.  I gave it 3 stars because it is a good video, great to watch and Spanky is very good at this style.  I am impressed. I just don't think it gives enough 'how' you can as opposed to 'what' you can do to develop this talent.",1443398400,,1109,4.031963470319635
8564296,2,B00B8W7L7O,"George is a really good drummer and he can play some very creative grooves and fills..... but he's not a good teacher and cannot explain his ideas very well. There is little valuable instructions on the dvd, only some comments about ""switching things around"". Then he goes on to play some complex examples with no explanations as to what he is actually doing. And he concludes by saying things like ""it's not that hard, practice it until you get it"". The included pdf file does a lot more to fleshout the concepts than George does... but you have to decypher them yourself. At least the transcritpion on the pdf is very well done.

All in all, this dvd is entertaining, but not much instructional. Watching him play can give you some cool ideas of your own. Just know that you'll have to figure them out yourself.

If you're interested in offtime playing (polyrhythms, beat displacement, playing over the bar, etc.), check out Gavin Harrison dvds and books. You'll get some very interesting concepts with solid explanations.",1440547200,,1024,4.8125
8564297,4,B00B8W7L7O,Great!,1422489600,,6,6.0
8564298,2,B00B8W7L7O,"I watched this dvd a long time ago and just realized I forgot to put up a review.  The reason I give two stars is because he is a good drummer and does some things that while fun for practice would not sit well with a bunch of musicians you were playing with and he also does a very poor job of explaining what he is doing.  If you cant explain what you are doing you don't know what you are doing (simple as that) I was very disappointed in this dvd set hudson music dvd's are going downhill and turning into a musician of the month type thing rather than quality instruction.  I love steve smith's dvd, even greg bissonette and tommy igoe please return to instruction rather than bs
Also as far as people writing in their reviews (not for beginners) how do you know because you don't understand it I am going to look more closely at these reviews as well as most of them seem to be shill's",1413763200,,891,4.1686046511627906
8564299,3,B00B8W7L7O,"Mixed feelings on this one. He plays some very interesting, creative, sometimes ""out there"" stuff. He's a huge talent and that can't be denied. Where this disc falls short is that he's not great at explaining anything. For one thing, a lot of things he says show a lack of formal study, in terms of rhythm theory. Anyone who has an academic understanding of rhythm and timekeeping will likely be irked by some things. For example, he will say he's going into ""3/4 time"" (implying a new time signature) when all he really does is shift to a triplet feel from a straight 8th feel, staying in 4/4. The whole section with moving ""the one"" is also a little misleading. It seems that all he really does is just play a crash/accent on different counts, without actually shifting the beat or anything like that. It's likely to really confuse someone who has yet to study rhythm on paper. Another one: in the ""switcheroo"" examples he claims that he is playing he beat ""completely backwards"". Again, not true. He simply does a displacement by one 16th, as extensively explained by drummers like Gavin Harrison. Also when he attempts to break down an explanation or describe what he is about to do, he is often at a loss for words and will just put his finger up and say ""just...check it out"", and proceed to play something really complex. The list can go on. So bottom line: monster creative playing, good drum sounds, misleading and semi-useless explanations.",1402012800,5,1450,4.690196078431373
8564300,4,B00B8W7L7O,I have to give it 4 stars and not 5 because the music that is included is too brief to get a feel for most of what he is demonstrating. I think that he should have utilized a live band for at least some of the examples. McGurdy is extremely talented and innovative with his off beats time signatures but his drum sound is very dry but maybe that suits his style. DVD contents are well documented but Bonus footage is too short.,1399334400,,427,4.156626506024097
8564301,5,B00B8W7L7O,"finally came this amazing dvd,that shows us clearly and perfectly some tips,tricks and more advices..iif you are a funky drummer nd you wanna try some new beats,syncopation and fresh rhythm,YOU NEED THIS DVD. it's AMAZING.",1394582400,,222,5.371428571428571
8564302,3,B00B8W7L7O,It's good just wish spanky yet a little deeper in detail when explaining some things. Overall good DVD to add a new concept when playing,1386201600,,136,4.48
