Yuen Biao's final fighting scene is fun to watch.  The big problem was that  you spend most of the film wondering whether you should hate Ching-Ying Lam  for not teaching Yuen, or hate Yuen for being such a pest.  An original  plot, loads of Kung-Fu, and some interesting characters, make The Prodigal  Son a film to see.",935971200,5,470,4.5

Picture is clear for the most part like most remastered films except for slight tears in the original film that probably couldn't  be repaired further. DVD contains the basic actor profiles on Yuen Biao and  Sammo Hung. Plot-wise it is a story of a spoiled young man who wants to  become a top kung fu fighter. However, his rich father, not wanting his  only son to be hurt, pays off potential challengers. Eventually, he meets  up with his future sifu, or teacher, of the wing chun style thru a  travelling opera troupe. Later, the sifu is killed by the henchmen of a  government official's son which in turn forces a fight between the two  young men. Overall, the training scenes and fight scenes of the wing chun  style in this movie are great although true wc practitioners will see that  its been modified a bit for filming purposes. The philosphies and teachings  though are for the most part true to the wing chun credo.",921628800,6,1011,4.592178770949721

The action isn't too much, though the whole 'destruction of the opera' scene gets a little bloody, but where I drew the line on 'not for kids' is in the interactions between the two kung fu master brothers.

948311,5,6304966946,"This movie directed by Samo Hung is probably the best Yuen Biao martial arts flick ever produced and is sure to please any martial arts fan.

The story revolves around Yuen Biao, who calls himself Kung Fu King, and under the false impression that he is the undefeated champion of China through matches fixed by his side kick under the instruction of Yuen Biao's over protective father, he finally meets an Opera performer whose kung fu skills are unparalled and refuses to throw the match; and, having been so badly humiliated, seeks to convince the opera singer to be his master to hardly any avail.

In the meantime, an expert kung fu practitioner who has really never been defeated is searching for someone with whom he could actually spar in a truly competitive match, and, having witnessed the formidable kung fu of the opera singer, challenges him to a duel whose outcome remains inconclusive given the fact that the opera singer suffers from asthma and his nemesis doesn't want to take unfair advantage.

However, the villain's henchmen burn down the opera troupe, thereby, forcing the opera singer to seek refuge within the vicinity of his estranged brother's home, where, he is gradually persuaded to impart his kung fu skills to Yuen Biao, after his brother, played by Samo Hung in what can be considered a small role, challenges him to do so. While, his master teaches him close range Wing Chun, his master's brother teaches Yuen Biao long range Wing Chun as well as how to take advantage of the opponent through any means available, and when, Yuen Biao's master is killed by his nemesis' henchmen, Biao takes revenge and challenges the villain to a duel, which comprises of some of the most well-choreographed and exhilarating fight sequences ever captured on film, with Biao finally defeating his opponent and, thereby, truly earning himself the title of Kung Fu King.

Highly recommended.",1357776000,2,1902,4.91588785046729

948315,5,6304966946,"Excellent period Kung-fu film. It features outstanding Kung-fu scenes, beautiful cinematography, and amusing and clever dialogue.

We follow the ""Street Brawler"" (Yuen Biao), as he strives to learn martial arts from a master he has selected. The master is reluctant to teach, and the ""Street Brawler"" must prove his worth somewhat to learn.

Although *slightly* over-plotted, this film has a unique balance of all the important elements one looks for in a Sammo Hung film. The comedy, the innovative and savage Kung-fu, and the unusual dramatic structure.

It is never boring, particularly the start of the film. It is so well made that I could watch at least another hour of this film if it were possible.

Yuen Biao certainly rivals Jackie Chan in this film. It is his second starring role, but it is played with such ability you would never know.

Sure, the ending's a little ""syncopated"", but the overall effect of this film is too much for any niggling details to harm it. A must-see in this genre.",1294531200,,1003,4.842105263157895

948317,5,6304966946,"Sammo Hung Kam-Bo's first film on Wing Chun and one of its important experts Leung Jan was the exquisite treatise named Warriors Two (1978). His second movie, The Prodigal Son (1981), would be a much more box-office successful and less didactic prequel to that film and would be his biggest hit until his next movie Carry on Pickpocket (1982). It should be noted that Sammo's importance to the action and martial art genre cannot be overstated and his 1980s directed efforts are still some of the supreme examples of Hong Kong entertainment. This movie is one of his best and among several of the Golden Harvest produced action classics that I have seen many, many times.

In Warriors Two, the important Wing Chun practitioner Leung Jan was an elder gentleman brilliantly played by Leung Kar-Yan. He is now portrayed by Yuen Biao (Knockabout, Project A) as a protected somewhat spoilt kid whose hubris is directly related to the fact that he has won all his fights, unbeknownst to him though they were thrown. He keeps on his fraudulent winning ways until he tries to fight the brilliant and effeminate Peking opera female impersonator star Leung Yee-Tai (Lam Ching Ying: Mr. Vampire (1985), Painted Faces (1988)) who stars as Lotus Poon, is a master in Wing Chun and unwilling to take a bribe. This defeat along with the realization that all his wins were faked (and the help of another defeat by two ""mole"" people) leads him to seek a sifu in Leung Yee-Tai. He refuses and Leung Jan has his dad buy the opera so he can take a job there and hopefully get Yee-Tai to acquiesce.

Meanwhile, Ngai Fei (played by the composer Frankie Chan Fan-Kei in his second acting performance) the son of royalty sees Yee-Tai fight and feels he must challenge him to a battle. This is analogous to the earlier story of Leung Jan; both are prodigal sons, except that Ngai Fei can actually fight. This leads to an awesome fight on a junk between Ngai and Yee-Tai that is interrupted by Yee-Tai's asthma attack. Ngai being honorable will not take advantage of his sick opponent. However, his two of his cronies employed by Ngai's father are not so exemplary. They see Yee-Tai as a threat and later try to off him in an overly violent attack by hired ninja-like assassins. This is one of the few scenes in the film where compared to the tone of the film was a bit excessive (though still quite cool).

To escape from these assassins and to allow Yee-Tai to heal, they go to Yee-Tai's Wing Chun brother Wong Wah Bo's (director Sammo Hung) house where he is not teaching his overweight daughter Twiggy (Ho Wai-Han) how to fight he is doing calligraphy (one of the funniest and impossible to describe scenes; also shows his interest in this art form analogous to the calligraphy fighting scene in The Magnificent Butcher (1979)). He is a master of the long distance form (masculine) of Wing Chun while his comrade Yee-Tai knows only close fighting. Leung Jan must get both of these masters to teach him so he can become a stalwart in martial arts and take part in the ubiquitous training scenes.

As normal in biographic cinema, Sammo Hung takes some dramatic license in its portrayal of these real-life characters (which he also did in Warriors Two). Leung Yee-Tai and Wong Wah Bo did in fact teach Leung Jan. Leung Yee Tai was in fact in an opera troupe ""Red Junk"" (also known as the King Fa Wui Goon troupe) and was known for his ""Six-and-a-half point Long Pole"" technique which was not addressed in this film. Leung Yee-Tai was known for playing a female lead (female players were illegal at this time) which his portrayer Lam Ching Ying also did under the tutelage of sifu Fan Fok-Fa. This helps in his authentic display and wonderful performance. Possibly his best, though he will always be known for being the thick eye-browed priest in Mr. Vampire and he has mentioned his favorite is in Painted Faces. While the history of Wing Chun is somewhat sketchy and anecdotal, the time period for this movie takes place around the 1850s.

Hong Kong action film expert Bey Logan has named this as his favorite martial art film and it is hard to disagree. While there are a few moments of brutality that seem out-of-place and many of the fights make you wish they were longer, it is a thoroughly satisfying film. Two of the fights: with Lam Ching Ying fighting Frankie Chan and Yuen Biao fighting Frankie Chan are worth watching several times. The finale is quite brutal and fits the Wing Chun mantra of ""If an opponent is hurt, go for his wounds"" quite well. The action is brilliant, fast paced and fits the theme of the movie quite well with gorgeous displays of Wing Chun and other styles. The plot actually helps the film instead of being inconsequential or a distraction. It is also an exquisite looking film with cinematographer Ricky Lau Koon-Wai (director of Mr. Vampire and many more kyonsi films) doing a superb job. There are also the descriptive backstage Peking opera scenes and the Cantonese comedy which works almost seamless with the action helps make this movie a most enjoyable experience. In fact it is one of my favorite martial art movies (cannot choose one though) and one I would recommend to convert others on to this genre.

I have the Fortune Star/Fox release which is uncut, has a good transfer but no extras except trailers. The biggest plus is that there are no dubtitles. However, the spelling and grammar can be atrocious at times (or quite hilarious) like ""5There aren't"" and ""he's fate as a pig"". It does not include the original mono release and the remix can sound quite bad at times. Here is another example of an R1 release Hong Kong release that does not match the Hong Kong Legends R2 release for extras. The HKL version has a Bey Logan commentary and other extras (I cannot comment on them since I do not own it).",1221177600,,5828,4.658892128279883
948338,4,6304966946,"Someone owes me an apology because I didn't see this sooner.  Probably the white man.  I've been in to kung fu for years and had never seen this until yesterday.  What up with that?  Out of all of Sammo's ground-breaking films, I've never even seen this in a store.  I've seen ""Iron-Fisted Monk"" and ""Warriors Two"" in the store, but not ""The Prodigal Son""?  That makes no sense at all.  While I like the other two, this one blows them away.  It's by no means perfect, but what is?

This movie wastes little time.  Yuen Biao is the self-proclaimed town champion, not knowing that all his opponents are bought off by his old man.  After getting his tail kicked by a cross-dressing, eyebrowless opera star (Lam Ching Ying, who's excellent), he begs the man to teach him real Wing Chun.  The man declines, of course, so Biao joins the opera for the sake of persistence.  After the opera troupe is wiped out by hired goons, Lam takes Biao home to teach him, with the aid of Lam's brother (Sammo Hung, who directed and is pretty amazing himself).

The story is really nothing great, but the fight scenes totally are.  Absolutely magnificent.  You feel every hit, even every block.  And talk about fast.  The widescreen digital remastering job and optional English dub only makes it that much better.  Some things did bother me; like how the slaughter of about 20 dudes seems like no big deal; and how Sammo isn't in this long enough, and doesn't really fight anybody.  Those complaints aside, this flick rocks and is a crucial addition to any kung fu collection.

948340,3,6304966946,"""Prodigal Son"" has the absolute best authentic Wing Chun fight scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The movie starts off kinda slow and the Cantonese Opera scenes will probably turn off many viewers, however, if you can get past the first half of the movie it gets much better. Basically, when Sammo Hung appears in the movie and the training starts - that's when it gets worth watching. Overall, I would say the movie has some good fight scenes and some decent comedy, but Kung Fu students, particularly Wing Chun practitioners, will probably enjoy this movie more than others.",1160697600,3,577,4.7227722772277225

948345,5,6304966946,"Prodigal Son is about two-thirds of one of the best kung fu movies ever made. From the film's opening up through the arson and slaughter at the traveling Chinese opera troupe encampment (sorry about that spoiler), the story (about a spoiled kung fu wannabe and his very reluctant teacher) is involving and the action is crisp. The martial arts choreography, which accurately depicts the effective Wing Chun style of kung fu, sets a new standard for the genre. However, when director Sammo Hung makes his entrance as historical kung fu figure Wong Wah Bo in mid-film, the movie veers sharply and awkwardly into comedy and then falls flat. Prodigal Son bounces back a bit in the final reel for the obligatory showdown but with the marvelous actor Lam Ching-Ying having already taken an earlier exit, the film doesn't fully recover. However, Lam's performance as the historical Wing Chun master Leung Yee Tai and his spot-on fight scenes are just enough to earn Prodigal Son a five star recommendation.

Note: I strongly recommend watching this and any other Chinese films in the original Cantonese soundtrack (with English subtitles). English language dubbing is distracting and greatly detracts from the experience of viewing a good foreign film like this one.",1125532800,12,1259,5.082125603864735
948346,5,6304966946,"There are very few films out there that can claim they present any authentic Wing Chun Kung Fu; this movie is one of them.  The fight scenes are fast-paced and fluid, they are not the typical choreographed fights of other old school kung fu flicks.  The actual movements that the actors perform appear to be some Yip Man lineage movements, so take this film with a grain of salt.  As much as the Yip Man students would love to claim they are ""The Original"", this is simply not so - Their lineage is one of many that are all original in their own way.  They just happened to be represented in this film.  That being said, it is a very entertaining flick and the actors do a great job of presenting the Wing Chun style.  Lam Ching-Ying, who plays ""Painted Face Kam,"" is by far the best of the three main practitioners in the film; this is because I believe he is actually a Wing Chun practitioner off-screen.

There is one part of the film that will make you cringe, however, and that is the fight at the end involving the movie's hero, played by Yuen Biao.  The Wing Chun is almost nonexistent during this fight.  Instead, Yuen Biao reverts to some flashy wushu garbage that you've seen a million times before.  This one fight is not enough to ruin the film, however, and ""The Prodigal Son"" remains in the number one spot of my favorite Kung Fu flicks (Bruce Lee aside).

The movie is worth purchasing just to watch Lam Ching-Ying's performance.  This movie has the best representation of Wing Chun Kung Fu in a motion picture, and Bruce Lee's films aside, is my favorite Kung Fu movie of them all.  Bruce Lee's films contain much of the essence of Wing Chun and even some techniques, but he also flavored it with many varying styles culminating in his own Jeet Kune Do.  So, I don't consider Bruce Lee's work to represent true Wing Chun; though you can recognize a lot of what he does and the principles of JKD and Wing Chun are very similar.",1123977600,3,1942,4.418539325842697

The fighters perform their moves fast and realistic, like they're really trying to hit each other. It's not like other movies where it seems they are being too flashy showing off moves rather than actually fighting.  You'll need the slo-mo feature on your dvd to capture all the cool choreography in this one.  Also, i don't think people are stressing this enough; besides Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, and Lam Ching Ying, there is another great reason to see this...the incredible Frankie Chan!  He makes a great and formidable villain(although he's not quite the bad guy that one would expect...he has respect for his opponents, which makes him a very cool antagonist in the film).  ANY kung fu film worth its salt has a formidable villain(otherwise, how would the hero be able to show off his skills?).

Yep, it's amazing. I just hope you go get it, for your sake.
Th story is deep, (Revenge is only a fraction of the plot.)and  it has very likable characters. Lam Ching Ying is the best in this film. Biao is awsome, but it's all about the Wing Chun master. This exciting form, just about never caught on film,(It's the first time I've seen it besides the fantasy title ""Wing Chun"" with Michelle Yoeh[Also great]) has juiced me up to try to find a school of Wing Chun. I've always wanted to take up a style, and I've found one. Exhilarating!!
The action direction won an award in China. This choreography can be compared to Yuen Woo Ping's brilliance because it shows just the right angle you need to see at just the right time. The editing is delicious! Slow motion shots, hard hitting realism, and tons of it. Sammo moves like a limber gymnast here, definately in top form.

948421,5,6304966946,"For the age of the film (made in 1982), this film really surprised and pleased me. I wasn't expecting such intensity, but it is frequently said that this film started the modern fighting kung fu flicks of the 80's, which in my opinion is the best due to lack of wires and other digital tools that now invade the majority of the newer flicks. It was straight forward Kung (Gung) Fu skills. This film is somewhere up in my top 5 martial arts film of all time, and can rival any kung fu movie of any time. I have become a huge fan of Lam Ching Ying,Yuen Biao,Sammo Hung, and Frankie Chan because of this film. The story, as stated by everyone else here, focuses around Biao's character as the Prodigal Son who who is recognized around his town as the fighter who has never lost a battle. However, the townspeople know something that Biao himself is oblivious to, which is the fact that Biao's father is paying off challengers to protect his only precious son. One day, a true Kung Fu master (Lam Ching Ying) teaches him a lesson and Biao soon realize the truth afterwards. The rest of the film has Biao relentlessly following the master pleading him to become his teacher. The movie will start off slow with the beginning fight not being too impressive, but don't let that turn you off because it definitely gets better. Throughout the rest of film are amazing fights involving Lam, Biao, Frankie, and Sammo. This film displays probably the best view of Wing Chun seen in a movie. One of the best fights I have ever seen takes place between Lam Ching Ying and Frankie Chan with Lam using Wing Chun and Frankie using what im assuming some sort of Tiger or Eagle style that looks like Mantis-form (I am a former kung fu student). Folks, this fight is so fast and realistic, I cant help thinking its better than the fights from fist of legend or drunken master 2 (but of course, not quite). These guys are TRYING to hit each other, but at the same time the speed of the fight is insane. The hand movements and contacts are so quick, it's amazing that the fighters were able to keep up with themselves. This is true great martial arts at its finest. Biao and Sammo also show their usual great skills with some brilliant fighting from Biao in the last battle. However, it was Lam Ching Ying that took me away with his Wing Chun abilities. I've seen him in other films (Mr. Vampire), and he doesn't get quite as good as he did here. This man is extremely talented and totally stole the whole movie in my opinion. I was kind of let down when Biao didn't use wing chun very much if at all in the last battle, but the fight was still very impressive. Aside from the fighting, the movie is hilarious with great comedy provided by Sammo. Prodigal Son is one of Sammo's greatest works by far, and the many awards the movie has won would show that. Movies are never made like this anymore and for the greatest kung fu flicks of all time, this is no exception. There are at least 3 versions of the dvd I know of with the best coming from the Hong Kong Legends distributors. You'll need an all-region dvd player to play their region 2 PAL dvds. It's worth it tho folks, the video and sound are all remastered to the fullest and the extras are incredible. These distributors live to remaster kung fu flicks. There are also all-coded Universe and Megastar dvd releases too which are decent enough, but don't match to HKL. Either version is fine, but you gotta at least check it out and make your own opinions about it. Other great Sammo and Biao flicks are Eastern Condors, Righting Wrongs, and almost any movie alongside Jackie.

So guess what we will be watching on Christmas day?",1040256000,,340,4.106060606060606
948423,3,6304966946,"I bought this DVD for one reason and one reason only:  because I'd heard that it had the Wing Chun fighting style in it.
Over all, it wasn't a bad movie.  However it seemed a little dated; the production quality seems to be similar to the cheap Kung Fu movies I used to watch on Saturday afternoon years ago on TV:  bad overdubs, etc.  However I did like the fact that there was some Wing Chun in the movie and for that reason I'm glad I bought it.  It would be nice though if someone would release a  better produced, more modern movie that emphasized the Wing Chun style.",1038355200,3,573,4.2110091743119265
948424,5,6304966946,"That's the best one in the world.  if I have one movie to watch in my life time, I would always watch this number one movie. Yuen Biao and Ching Ying Lam and Sammo Hung makes the kung fu the most elegance than other movies.  This matial art is my number one pick of all the number ones DVD.",1037491200,,290,3.8983050847457625
948425,4,6304966946,"The movie was very good. The story line and the characters are great. The fight scenes are excellent! Sammo Hung is one of the absolutes best in the business.  They explain some basic points of the fighting techniques used in the film. There is lots of action! This is a must have for any fan of the martial arts movie genre.
The movie I received however was not dubbed in English. This is unfortunate because many people prefer to watch the entire movie without having to look away from the main view in order to read the English sub-titles. There is an English dub version available. I liked the movie so much that I think I will purchase the English dub version as well. Maybe someone will buy mine for a cheaper price.",1008806400,,722,4.428571428571429
948426,5,6304966946,"Well, this film features some of the best handwork in any kung fu movie. Some of the reviewers mention that the wing chun seems slightly different, that is because IT IS NOT JUST WING CHUN! The handwork is also snake style, where wing chun was actually derived from. Overall I would recommend this to any kung fu fan/student.",997833600,,325,4.620689655172414
948427,5,6304966946,"The only thing wrong with this film, is if you don't see it.  One of the BEST films ever showing the amazing style of wing chun.  An all-star cast as well including many famous Kung fu stars highlighted by Sammo Hung, and the star Yuen Biao.  The fights in this film are choreographed perfectly, and the showcase of both amazing styles and forms, the acrobatics are just as amazing.  The story is easily followed and it's a very good/deep plot.  Like I said before there is nothing wrong with it.  IF you collect kung fu films you must have this one or else your collection will never be complete.",994550400,2,597,4.431192660550459
948428,4,6304966946,"This movie was just bad-a$$ from the get-go.  You are introduced to a character who thinks that he is the best kung fu martial artist.  It turns out that his dad is staging all of his fights without his son knowing.  When I first put this movie in, my brother didn't feel like watching an action comedy, but 15 minutes into the movie it had him laughing and enthused.  Aside from the good quality of humor, this film displayed some terrific stunt work and martial arts.  The fight sequences are choreographed very well, and the overall directing of the movie was quite impressive.  Whether you are a big fan of a lot of kung fu action or not, this movie will have you glued to your seat for the entire 102 minutes.  The fight scenes in particular are very artful, and exciting to watch.  Pay attention to the ""master"" in the touring opera (the guy without eyebrows...he is one bad fother mucker!).  Another great part of the movie was Sammo Hung.  I am not really a fan of his, but he cracked me up.  He displayed mind boggling agility, and stomach aching comedy.  This movie is honestly very good, and would have received 5 stars, but I was a little disappointed with the ending scene of the movie.  Not that it wasn't choreographed well, but just that I don't feel as though Yuen Biao had the adequate skill level to defeat the opposing kung fu master.  That was just my opinion, but my brother disagrees, he thought it ended well.  Overall, good laughs, good action, good camera work, great characters, great story = a tasty 4.5 star cocktail.  Drink one with me, you won't be disappointed.",992044800,3,1593,4.5174825174825175
948429,4,6304966946,"The first time I saw the Prodigal Son, I was very pleased to see a Wing Chun movie. Especially the Wing Chun actions done by the character: Leung Yee Tai ( the teacher of Leung Jan, in the movie ) are very impressive. I just don't know if Lam Ching Ying played another Wing Chun movie, but he would be very good. I found it on the other hand, not so good that in the final battle, Yuen Biao as Leung Jan, was using other techniques than Wing Chun. But it stays one of my top 10 fighting movies.

948430,5,6304966946,"No frills, no wires,no fancy film editing,just some of the flat out best hand to hand martial arts that you'll ever witness period. I just viewed this movie afer reading all the various reviews saying that this movie was  so good even for being produced in 81' and was it ever. I must admit that I  was a little sceptic myself,but after seeing it all doubt in my mind has  been erased and then some. Never before or never again will such a movie be  produced,so much work must have been put into the cheoreography that it  would take an encyclopedia to remember all the various moves presented  throughout the fight scenes(they get that intricate) this is definitley  Sammo Hungs' absoulute best directorial edtion and can not be touched,while  I must admit that I have already fallen too deep into the Jet Li  ""wire-fu"" era(I've seen them all) to call this one of my favorite  movies,it still brings me to owe more respect to this movie than just about  all others production wise. For the time it was created this movie can  definitley hang with the big boys of the 90s',do not write this one off as  another ""old school movie"" and not get it,it must be in every  serious Kung-fu collection out there. If you enjoyed Drunken Master 2,or  Fist of Legend this one will amaze you as well with on the ground Kung-fu  straight Wing Chun style that is as fast and furious as those two  flicks(and made in 81',wow!)As for video transfer it was equally  amazing,with the VHS transfer as good as I expected the DVD to be,and the  DVD transfer beyond my imagination. This is also probably the only kung-fu  movie that I ever learned anything from with some great training  sequences. A classic forever and ever more,buy it today!",961372800,12,1721,4.595394736842105

I couldn't believe it was made in '81! The choreography is superb and the speed of execution is unbelievble!  The cast is woderfull , from Samo Hung to Yuen Biao to the excellent Frankie Chan to  the godly Lam Ching Ying ( his wing chun is really breath-taking ).
