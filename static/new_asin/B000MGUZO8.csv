2736044,5,B000MGUZO8,"The smile of Carlos Benavent on his face after his bass guitar solo in the tune Spain is worth alone to buy this DVD. Everything was exactly right for this concert, the location and stage at the Palau de la Musica in Barcelona, the cast of musicians with Chick and his band Touchstone, the deep, sincere and inspiring performance by all of them accompanied by two, young flamenco dancers. I've seen this band at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands in 2005, which was already a unique experience, but on this DVD they take the music to the next level. The music is a unique blend of many styles, like jazz, latin, Spanish music, but I would do no justice to this music by pinpointing it to a certain category. Most of all it is good music, Touchstone music, performed on sacred ground.",1176508800,12,795,4.489655172413793

8169155,5,B000MGUZO8,I have been a fan of Chick Corea for many years.  This performance is now one of my favorite recordings of his.  He has assembled a collection of virtuoso musicians who clearly work well together to produce a coherent sound.  Ironically the CD by the same name is a disappointment and I conclude that the studio was not the right venue for these musicians.  Put them in a beautiful hall in front of an appreciative audience and you get magic.,1358985600,,442,4.4875
8169156,4,B000MGUZO8,"This is an awesome live version of an amazing album by Chick Corea. It seems that this concert is not including all the musicians that participated in the recording though, and some of them double as performers of different instruments, filling-in for the recorded music. But this is a great show, no doubt. Corea is as inspired as ever and, as a plus, some Spanish dancers do their traditional tapping that fits perfectly with the music. The sound quality is just amazing. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the video quality, given some blurry and out-of-focus images here and there (that's why I gave it four stars). It might be due to the transcription from one media to another but, otherwise, this is a great DVD. If you did not know it, the music is an elaboration by Corea from The Ultimate Adventure, which is one of the classic science fiction novels by Ron L. Hubbard, who wrote the book years before he founded Scientology. I do not like Hubbard's books so much and, as many people, I also have my doubts about Scientology. But Chick Corea's musical version of this book is just amazingly rich and powerful, extremely creative. Which is a very impressive feat for a musician with such a long career as Mr. Corea. This is a classic, no doubt. And if you did not hear the CD, you should start with it. It's just a remarkable collection of music that defies age and genre. Enjoy!",1349654400,2,1395,4.584
8169157,5,B000MGUZO8,"I am a rather straight ahead jazz fan.  This, for the most part, is not that. What has really grabbed me about this concert is the amazing abilities these musicians display. There are serious grooves too.

Chick himself is more of a musical genius than I had previously realized. To see and hear him is tremendous in this event. I recall Tom Brechtlein's drumming from Robben Ford days and I see a completely new side of his playing here. Fantastic touch and musicality! Gorgeous cymbals I might add! The percussionists are also remarkable.

Now, where did that bass player come from? Mars? OMG -- he is just insane! Way different and astounding! The flutist/saxophonist is also among the greats.

Taking the concert as a whole, it is incredible how this group can remember these pieces as Chick has envisioned them and written them. All the musicians here are exceptionally gifted.

The sound and photography are excellent also.

This not for the faint of heart and does require attention. I do not recommended this for background music or a party. When you put this in your player try to not be distracted. Prepare for the ultimate adventure!",1265414400,2,1144,4.811224489795919
8169158,5,B000MGUZO8,"i bought this dvd 5days ago and i least saw it once a day!.the music is superb, the blending between all members of the ban(SPAIN-EGYPT-AMERICA are represented)means two things ,jazz is the art that overcomes barriers of anything,and if we as people collaborate so well in music then sky is the limit!.and here sky was more than reached.
CHICK s idea of incorporating two of the most prestigious flamenco dancers
is spain(giving them full freedom on stage)aded extra spice to this beautifull masterpiece my regards,apreciation and love to those two!

8169159,5,B000MGUZO8,Excellent concert.  I saw it live.  It's like bringing the concert home with me.,1181692800,,80,4.642857142857143
8169160,5,B000MGUZO8,"The most thrilling flamenco music & dancing EVER that would make even sir Paco De Lucia wish he was on stage with the band.

I wish I was in the crowd as well, the DVD gave me this proper surge of rush to the brain as soon as the Touchstone band version of ""Spain"" was applauded to.

A DVD with FABULOUS 'Extras' footage & behind the scenes too with Chick & the rest of the band.",1179014400,,379,3.973684210526316
