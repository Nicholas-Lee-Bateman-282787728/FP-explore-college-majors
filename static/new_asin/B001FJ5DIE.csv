8302118,4,B001FJ5DIE,"Excellent piece of Arsenal nostalgia showing some of the greatest players from the 70's, Brady, Radford, Kennedy, Graham, Storey, Stapleton amongst others.  The only thing that stopped me giving it 5 starts was that there is only ITV games on here not matches shown on the BBC, but as it was produced by ITV it's not surprising.  Brought back many memories. Highly recommended for Arsenal fans and football historians everywhere.",1369526400,,429,5.114285714285714
