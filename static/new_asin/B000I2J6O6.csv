2651540,5,B000I2J6O6,"At least two of the films, Living Desert and Vanishing Prairie, are full length and were Academy Award winners. At the time(1950's) nature photography was quite difficult with huge, heavy, bulky cameras, long before the National Geographic channel or Animal Planet. So these films are literally the ground floor of nature photography. I am expecting a wonderful set, restoring the original color and sound. When I saw them in the 70's the color had already metamorphed into green skies, for example. Disney has promised us a full restoration. Do you remember seeing the tarantula and the birth of a buffalo calf? Through it all we have the wonderful humor of Winston Hibler's narration. I can't wait!",1160611200,52,700,5.043103448275862
2651577,5,B000I2J6O6,I am so glad that I came across this Disney DVD.  I only need to purchase two more like this and I will have the set.  But I need the money first.  As a kid the whole family gathered around the TV and watched these shows.  The real early Disney movies where the best.  The new stuff coming out to us is just junk.,1356220800,,313,3.828125
2651578,5,B000I2J6O6,"I knew the video would be good from my childhood memory but I loved watching my students be equally enthralled by the video.  They watched,as the animals and insects lived their lives, and as the kangaroo rats partied their escape from the snake, with the same enthusiasum as my brother and sisters did decades ago.",1349395200,,315,4.7272727272727275
2651579,4,B000I2J6O6,"This Disney movie has been a favorite for years since I first saw it on the big screen.  This packaged set covers more of Disney's True Life adventures and the originals were master pieces.  Because of their conversation to DVD format, I think some of the original punch is missing, especially the color quality as seen on my current home TV.  I will continue to use these segments in my teaching as some good points are made but the kids are less attentive than they used to be for movies of this length.  I do appreciate Amazon'a willingness to carry items in this category as I doubted that old Disney movies are huge money makers.",1329609600,6,634,4.48695652173913
2651580,1,B000I2J6O6,"Al and Elma Millotte spent some months at my father's animal reserve on Queensland's Gold Coast in 1955...they built a special film set so the platypus could be filmed from beneath and above water....Al and Elma Millotte were equipped with 16 mm and 35 mm cine cameras with Cinemascope Lenses...and yet the film ended up only 15 minutes duration and in normal format...what happened? I am told my father the naturalist David Fleay disagreed with the filming techniques..and so my father's animal reserve did not even get a mention in the credits....we have the DVD and on seeing the result I can agree that there was cruelty inflicted on the subject matter......a platypus out in the freezing snow in daylight skidding down a slope,(obviously the animal had been pushed) and eventaully finding water...no night shooting as we see now on BBC nature series...all staged and set up.
The platypus is such a delicate animal and only comes out in the natural state at night...then there were possums and sugar gliders, also animals of the night out in the daylight, obviously being launched by an unseen human....some of the animals landed badly which may have caused injuries.
I cannot stand cruelty to animals, birds or reptiles!
Back then we used to think those True Life Adventures were terrific....thank goodness for the BBC...the BBC natural history unit really cares and never inflicts harm on our unique wildlife.....",1324857600,9,1419,5.042553191489362

2651583,5,B000I2J6O6,"If you only buy one of the four volumes of the Disney nature films, get volume two.  It has the best extras on it with a very good documentary about the series of films as a whole and the particular films on this two disc set are great examples of the series.  These are unique nature documentaries and much more entertaining than much of what you'll see on the Discovery Channel.",1297641600,8,380,4.338028169014085

2651586,5,B000I2J6O6,"My boyfriend and I LOVE to watch this series! Not only is it beautifully done, it has that wonderful nostalgic feel that old Disney cartoons and shows have. The narrator's voice took me back to childhood, as did the music. So great.",1256515200,,232,4.5476190476190474
2651617,5,B000I2J6O6,"I remember seeing Living Desert when I was young girl, the thing that impresed me was the flowers opening in slow motion, still my favorite part.  Great series.",1252886400,,160,4.714285714285714
2651618,5,B000I2J6O6,"I purchased this DVD because I remembered seeing ""The Living Desert"" as a boy in about 1957-58.....and being AMAZED!  It was the first time I had ever seen photography that allowed viewing a flower (in this case, cactus) as it opened.  I really enjoyed seeing this film again, along with ""The Vanishing Prairie"".  Photography in both is great.  I was glad to rediscover this gem.  My 11 year old granddaughter watched it twice.",1246147200,,427,4.794520547945205

2651624,5,B000I2J6O6,"This is an excellent reissue of these classic Disney True-life adventures.
Although heavily choreographed (use of forward and reverse filming, for instance - classically in the scorpion hoe-down in The Living Planet), they were often the first warning bell of things to come and, in their time, one of a very few films to depict wildlife ""in the wild"".
The colors have been digitally corrected so they now look much better than the originals (1950s).
Nice presentation tin as well.
The DVD also plays on a multi-region player in the UK (NTSC compatible player and TV).
It's still entertaining (although the style of presentation seems a little outdated now but it set the benchmark for those to come)even after 50+ years and this series should be in every Disney lovers collection.
The Vanishing Prairie sounds ominous in it's tone and predictions but this film actually helped preserve what was left so although they thought it would vanish forever, it hasn't (possibly thanks to this film).
A landmark in wild life documentaries.",1227312000,2,1031,5.035087719298246
2651625,5,B000I2J6O6,The program is excellent. Any nature lover or young person should really enjoy this one.,1220832000,,88,4.933333333333334

Presented by Roy Disney proof to have great teast!

Movies maid in the fifty's have not lost there charme and quality.
a Great achievement to bring back this artwork and fully restaurated.

I hope that the Disney compagny make an second release on Blu Ray.

2651657,4,B000I2J6O6,"I bought this as a gift for my mom, who has been talking about the great educational programs Disney used to have, and how well she remembers 'The Living Desert.'  We sat down to watch it together, and while the narration is clearly from a different time, the images hold up.  With all the emphasis today on the environment and the ways in which man encroaches on animals' habitats, it's particularly relevant and fascinating to watch.  I'd recommend it for adult and children alike.",1216598400,,483,4.726190476190476
2651658,5,B000I2J6O6,This is excellent. The color and sharpness and the accuracy of material covered are very well done.  It's fun to watch.,1209081600,,119,4.666666666666667
2651659,5,B000I2J6O6,"I remember seeing this series when I was a child and it impressed me then and it should be a great tool for teaching in grammer schools today.
It is true to life today as long as we have Desserts, but of course only Disney can tell a wonderful story.",1206921600,,250,4.02
2651660,5,B000I2J6O6,"Walt Disney, the ultimate family entertainer, struck the purest gold with his True Nature series.  I don't remember for certain, but I think there were seven features in the whole series.  ""The Vanishing Prarie"" was one of my favorites as was ""The Living Desert.""  I remember the cougar that got chased up a tall, long-spiked cactus by an angry peccary.  Don't you know that kitty was sore for a while!  The series was extremely entertaining as extremely educational at the same time.  Good ol' Disney.  Much of the material is considered dated now, but the basic information about the wildlife is still good.  Disney was considered ahead of his time, and this series is just another of many wonderful examples.  Get it and enjoy it with the whole family.",1203033600,2,755,4.790697674418604
2651661,5,B000I2J6O6,"Could you rate it a 10 or 100. Who couldn't love Disney's True Adventures. Yes, there is even a whole channel for animal adventures now, but they were the first--and they were the best. They are pack in a great package; durable and imaginative. The added interviews and backstage scenes are great. I can remember seeing them on their program (in black and white) when I was in first grade. They are wonderful. It was a treat to learn about the couple who filmed them too. Spending years and years filming things they thought was funny or interesting. Then bringing them back and someone putting them together into a story that is loved forever. I have all four of them. And we watch them over and over.",1187913600,9,702,4.535433070866142
2651662,5,B000I2J6O6,It was absolutely fabulous to see this and the other three true life adventures again!  I can see why they influenced so many people around the world.  I so glad that these are now available for everyone to enjoy!,1184457600,,213,4.435897435897436
2651663,4,B000I2J6O6,"Unfortunately, I can't watch the DVD - as I live in the UK and wasn't aware that there are zone categories - very disappointed as was a 70th birthday pressie for my father.  Advise zone notifications on Amazon to be clearer for consumers.  (rates 4* as watched with my father when I was kid and loved it!)",1183852800,2,305,4.333333333333333
2651664,5,B000I2J6O6,"I teach a college class in popular culture.  We were reading a book on Walt Disney, and I bought True Life Adventures just to show to the class.  I wasn't expecting to watch it for fun.  What a mistake.  This is fantastic.  Today we have Animal Planet and all the other educational networks, but the Disney documentaries are just so much better from an entertainment standpoint.  The scenery just brings oohs and aahs, and the humor and plotting, while maybe annoying to the scientific-minded, just make the stories flow.

What I really liked was you could watch The Vanishing Prairie, then on Disc 2 there is the segment of Disney's Wonderful World of Color, where you can see how he used the TV show to market the movie, then the Filmmakers Journal where you get some great behind the scenes footage on how the film was made.  (Wait till you see the snow-mobile!)

I bought this for class.  I'm getting all the others in the series for fun.",1176854400,15,942,4.553571428571429
2651665,5,B000I2J6O6,These DVDs are incredible! Just as I remember as a child.  The digital restoration is beautifully done...Highly recommend that these be purchased by Disney lovers and families looking for good old wholesome entertainment.,1173830400,16,221,5.696969696969697
2651666,5,B000I2J6O6,"These nature films, if you could find them at all, were previously only on VHS. I had already seen two of the films on the set on VHS, ""The Vanishing Prairie"" and ""The Living Desert"", and I was amazed how these old films from the 50's had such good cinematography considering the times. Now on DVD, these films have been cleaned up even more, and the video is not hard on the eyesight at all. 30 years before the Discovery Channel, it is truly amazing to see what Disney was doing in the realm of nature films.

""Seal Island"", produced in 1949, is known as Disney's first nature documentary and runs 26 minutes. It studies animal life on Seal Island, which is a small island in the Bering Sea. The life cycle of the seals is the dominant theme, of course, although the documentary talks about the other animal residents of the island too. Because it was Disney's first attempt at a nature documentary, it is awkward at spots. It tends to get very slow at one point, and then picks up the tempo with a bloody battle between feuding male seals fighting for dominance that tends to be a bit graphic.

""The Living Desert"" won the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary in 1953, and its theme is a day in the wildlife of the American desert southwest. On the humorous side, the best scene involves a couple of square-dancing scorpions, and on the dramatic side the best scene is probably a fight between a tarantula and a wasp. The commentary is well done, but some people might find it just a bit too jokey at points. It runs 70 minutes.

""The Vanishing Prairie"" also won the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary in 1954 and runs 71 minutes. Again, the photography is excellent, but the narration is depressing and the conclusions no longer true. Thanks to ecology minded films such as this one, efforts were started to help insure that the prairie and its wildlife don't disappear. Thus its overall message is best taken in a historical context. There are some great shots of prairie dogs that will remind you quite a bit of Meerkat Manor. Other featured animals include bighorn sheep, the Pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, coyotes, and buffalo.

""Nature's Strangest Creatures"" (1959), is the shortest of the films at only 15 minutes in length. It focuses on the wildlife of Australia 35 years before the Crocodile Hunter made these creatures more familiar to us all. Animals shown besides the requisite kangaroo include the giant bat, flying squirrel, and the duck-billed platypus.

""Islands of the Sea"" (1960), was nominated for an Academy Award for that year. This 28-minute film discusses and photographs the wildlife on the islands of Galapagos, Guadelupe, the Falklands, and Midway. Of course, they show the turtles of the Galapagos, and also the penguins of the Falklands. Although overall the film focuses more on birds, there is also quite a bit on the reptile inhabitants of these islands. One of the funniest segments include a penguin attempting to ""sing"" and an albatross attempting a clumsy landing in what had to be one of its less graceful moments.

The extras include ""Backstage with Roy Disney at Disney's Animal Kingdom: Desert Insects"", which actually is more of a retrospective on Roy's movie career than anything else. ""Backstage with Roy Disney at Disney's Animal Kingdom: Snakes"" focuses on the Orlando Animal Kingdom theme park and its snakes. ""Filmmakers' Journal"" is very interesting for those of us who wondered how the filmmakers accompished some of the shots they got in the making of the five featured films. This 40 minute bonus piece talks extensively with people who actually worked on the films and they tell you how certain shots were obtained and talk about various tricks that were employed. ""Collectors' Corner"" is a short three minute piece in which Disney artist and historian Stacia Martin shares some promotional items tied to the DVD's films. ""Trailers & Promos"" is the aptly named section on the original trailers and promos for the five featured films, both when they were shown on TV and in the theatres.

This is a truly great collection of nature films. You'll probably recognize in each of them the basic Disney ""formula"" for such films - They generally blended very good photography and narration on the overall wildlife being spotlighted. Mixed with that will be numerous humorous moments with animals doing what appear to humans as crazy stunts along with dramatic predator/prey moments and wildlife fight scenes that often end up in tragedy for one of the animals involved. On top of this, each of the films is well scored, with the music matching the mood of the scene being shown. Highly recommended.",1171324800,71,4665,4.845671267252196
