7872536,1,6304469136,"I've seen some movies of Maria Jo in Hong Kong, and this is actually the worst representation of her acting carrer. This movie also has the plot that any viwers can easily predict the ending of the film. This film  introdeced some new moves of gunman but some of the moves totally made me  laugh becasue they were just too artificial. The film seemed to be a little  violent. Not recommend for kids.",961459200,,399,4.438356164383562
