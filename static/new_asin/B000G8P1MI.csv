8129472,5,B000G8P1MI,"This ALPHA dvd has two nice looking prints of a Tex Ritter double feature. Western Swing giant Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys are featured in TAKE ME BACK TO OKLAHOMA (1940) as Tex and SLIM (Andrews) try to save the Pico Stageline from badguy Storm (Karl Hackett) and his outlaw gang. Tex needs help and sends for Bob 'n the Boys. They arrive singing atop a stagecoach and then perform several songs at a church benefit including the famous ""TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA"". Tex wins the stage race at the end and saves the stageline.
RIDER OF THE ROCKIES (1937) has Earl Dwire and Charlie King leading an outlaw gang stealing cattle on the U.S.-Mexican border. Arizona Ranger Tex goes undercover and joins the badguys as sidekicks Doc (Horace Murphy) and Pee Wee (Snub Pollard) complicate things. Jack Rockwell is leader of the Rangers and Yak Canutt is second in command. This is a good ol' fun time of a movie, one that will certainly leave you with a smile on your face. Good stuff all 'round, good prints, good tunes. Enjoy!",1260662400,,1022,4.559782608695652
