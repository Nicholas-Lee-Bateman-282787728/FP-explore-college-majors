2313243,4,B0009PW4EQ,"After Natalya Makarova left the Leningrad Kirov Ballet and defected to the West, her name would (according to her in this documentary) scarcely have been mentioned in the Soviet Union. But political climates change, and in 1989 Makarova visited her alma mater for the first time since her defection 19 years before. The fact that she defected is tactfully ignored by a teacher at the school as she tells her students about some of the famous dancers (including Makarova) whose pictures are on the wall, who ""danced on our stage and then achieved glory in many other countries, thus bringing fame to both our Russian and Soviet ballet.""
Makarova's narration differs from that of most dance documentaries, in that she freely offers her opinions, not hesitating to call Konstantin Sergeyev (former Artistic Director of the Kirov and now Artistic Director of the school) conservative, or to say that current Russian choreography is not really modern, not original. A compliment from her can even sound a bit backhanded, as when she says that former prima ballerina Irina Kolpakova was perfect in roles such as Cinderella and Aurora: "" . . . pure classical dance conveying innocent, uncomplicated joy. As for me, I always preferred more complex roles."" And what a slap in the face she gives to the London Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet)! After emphasizing how integral a part of Swan Lake the third act Mazurka is, she says that when she staged the ballet in London, she took out the mazurka, because she thought it was better to do that than to ""have it danced badly.""  In fact, she says that no one in the West knows how to do the mazurka.
A lot of time is spent with Oleg Vinogradov (then Artistic Director of the company) as he discusses aspects of his job, such as receiving threats on his life when one of his first acts as Artistic Director was to lay off over 90 of the older company members. He is very articulate, and he has interesting things to say, but I wish more time had been spent on the students and company members rather than on Vinogradov's discourses.
A number of former company members are shown teaching or coaching, including Irina Kolpakova (I pitied poor Veronika Ivanova during her coaching session with her), Gennadi Selyutski, Gabriella Komleva and Ninel Kurgapkina. Kurgapkina's friendly, bubbly stage personality carries over into her teaching-in both this documentary and ""Backstage at the Kirov,"" she always looks jolly.
Young principal dancers Veronika Ivanova, Elena Pankova, Zhanna Ayupova and Igor Zelensky, as well as reigning stars Altynai Asylmuratova and Farukh Ruzimatov, are shown in performances and rehearsals, and Makarova gives her opinions of them all.
While this documentary is not the gem that ""Backstage at the Kirov"" is, it is still a worthwhile addition to a balletomane's collection.",971913600,10,2851,4.976939203354298

2313253,5,B0009PW4EQ,"This is a wonderful love story between Captain John Smith whom just settled at Jamestown, Virginia and  Pocahantas.
Although this movie is not totally historically accurate in that Pocahontas in actual history married another man , whose name I cannot remember, because John Smith was told by Pocahontas father that he must return to England since in this movie it shows Captain John Smith betraying Pocahontas Father. But I loved it, it is very entertaining. But on  the other hand the Indians speak too good of English for Indians that just met the English that landed at Jamestown Settlement.",1380672000,,595,5.0

2313256,4,B0009PW4EQ,"The film wants to be a documentary of some sort, a reconstruction of the legend, maybe the truth behind the legend. At least it wants that legend to be realistic, and there is a lot to do to make it realistic.

The film insists on the conflicts of interests within the English camp with a nobleman Sir Edwin Wingfield among them. He is doing nothing, except looking for trouble with John Smith, plotting in all possible ways.  This aristocratic stance is criticized though at the time it must have been a lot less ridiculed, and a lot more feared. The film is not clear about why this young nobleman is on the crew. John Smith insinuates he must have been banned by his own father and this Wingfield is shown as ambiguous in his attitudes towards young boys and teenagers. But that's only innuendo.

Along that line the exclusively male context of the mission is clearly visible with situations that can be seen as strange like the dances and the singing at night to spend time. But once again that level is not developed and that is a shame, though this film pushes the relation between Pocahontas and John Smith a lot further than brother and sister, and yet not far enough to produce any progeny. That open innuendo at sex is in the line of men being men they will always find a way to satisfy their desires. But it is definitely not dealt with in any clear terms for most of these men.

On the other hand the Indians are described in a more realistic and more credible way. They have music and they sing. They dance too. They even make love, at least Powhatan does. They have entertainments and games. But they also have a lot of political discussions and conflicts. They are a normal human society with rivalries of all types, especially between Powhatan and his brother, between Pocahontas and her cousin. This makes the film more acceptable since decisions have to be taken and they are taken along realistic lines with realistic arguments.

But that leads to compromises and there the film introduces a twist. Instead of sending John Smith back to England to have some bad burns cured and healed, he is sent back to England by Powhatan's own decision: we can have peace with you, Englishmen, but John Smith has to leave.

Then the film starts with Pocahontas seeing the English ship arriving and ends with Pocahontas seeing the ship sailing away. An elliptical construction that makes John Smith secondary, in chains when arriving and banned when leaving.

Of course the difficulties of the settlement are far from clearly described. Apart from some kind of fever killing some men, apart from the Indians killing some others, the film does not show at all how these men could survive. They build a fort whose name is not Jamestown but Fort James, but they do not cultivate anything, they do not buy food from the Indians and at the most they beg for medicine. In other words they cannot even survive one month. On the other side the Indians are not really shown has having any kind of economy, no fields, no Indian corn, no hunting really. Once again how can these men survive?

The only instance of some kind of survival activity is hinted at on both sides when we are shown on both sides some kind of small animals, probably birds, being roasted on a spin over a fire. But that is slightly short about the necessities of life.

In other words this rewriting of the legend keeps the legend intact in many ways and it is nothing but a legend. No real concrete conditions and hardships are shown in a complete and constructive way. We can even wonder why the English have canoes to go up the river at the very beginning of their presence. How did they learn how to make them? Or did they trade them from the Indians?

Two fundamental questions are not answered. The first one is the simple credibility there is in a tale that brings an exclusively male group in a foreign country and the simple reproductive instinct is not taken into account. The second is the livelihood that requires some simple daily activities like hunting, agriculture, fishing, and going up and down the rivers. And these activities all imply constructive relations with the natives, exchanges, some kind of commercial or bartering activities. The film speaks of presents a lot but not of commercial exchanges and that is not realistic especially since these people are not sent by the King of England, but by some kind of private chartered company that has one objective: to make a profit, hence to bring some goods back that will generate that profit.

As a conclusion the real reconstruction of what happened around this Pocahontas princess is still to be done. Yet this film is good for the few realistic cameos we get of the culture and life of the Indians.

2313259,3,B0009PW4EQ,"This movie brings me back, I watched it alot as a kid and I still love the movie but there are some flaws that I notice now that when I was little I failed to notice. There are alot of historical flaws (no fort looks like it was built with boards from a Home Depot) and the main villain suffers from a bad costume wig. It does look cheap at some parts but still, the acting is very good and Sandrine Holt makes a beautiful Pocahontas. This is a fantastic movie for families but if you want a deeper movie about Pocahontas I'd suggest getting A New World instead.",1232582400,2,562,4.165137614678899

2313261,5,B0009PW4EQ,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is so romantic!  It's an idealized version of the Pocahontas story. (Hence, the title ""the Legend) It's the type of movie us women swoon over.  Miles O'Keefe is incredibly sexy and charming as John Smith. Seeing him scantily clad is nearly reason enough to buy this. Sandrine Holt is a youthful, energetic Pocahontas, both innocent and beautiful.  She is different from her tribe and her fascination with John Smith is understandable. Great film!",1130976000,3,497,4.880952380952381
2313262,3,B0009PW4EQ,"An ancient prophecy foretold three coming invasions against the Indian nation. The first invasion would come from the North, the second would be the ""black robes"" from the West. They have survived the first two, now the third was about to begin. So we are told in the opening sequence to 'Pocahontas - The Legend.'

Definitely not a masterpiece, but does succeed as a rather enjoyable, simplistic rendering of the famous love story of Pocahontas and John Smith. Sandrine Holt is absolutely beautiful as the Native American princess Pocahontas and the much maligned Miles O'Keefe is really quite good as the handsome and stalwart Englishman John Smith.

The problems with this film stem from budget limitations and shoddy production values. One of the first drawbacks I noticed was that everything was shot in closeups, so you never saw any beautiful panoramic views of the natural beauty to be found in the American wilderness. This indicated to me that their budget didn't allow them the opportunity to travel to any remote locations to get capture those vistas.

Secondly, I found the choice of clothing worn by the Indians somewhat disconcerting. Everything was exactly the same color and texture. It looked like the entire wardrobe for the tribe had been cut from one large piece of material. I'm not an expert in Native American clothing but I would've expected to see a variety of colors, shades and skins in keeping with the various types of animals that would have been indigenous to the area in 1607. There were other glaring discrepancies, such as the unauthentic look of the English fort that only hampered viewers imagination and ability to become immersed in the storyline.

If you're a Sandrine Holt fan or you have young children who like Pocahontas you'll certainly want to add this DVD to your collection. If not, it's a decent watch as a rental.",1127779200,22,1863,4.923566878980892
2313263,1,B0009PW4EQ,"If I had been paying attention, I would have realized that with Miles O'Keeffe in this film (Tarzan, the Ape Man, Sword of the Valiant - The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight), it wasn't going to be Last of the Mohicans. Actually, I was watching it to see Tony Goldwyn, who usually turns in a solid performance. Unfortunately, the same wig mistress who got hold of Miles in Sword of the Valiant - turning him into the Little Dutch Boy and totally distracting from the rest of the film - must have worked on Tony in this one, making him look ludicrous and again distracting from the film. Which only goes to prove, even though clothes don't make the man, a bad wig can ruin a performance and even an entire film.

Which makes me wonder, what were the filmmakers thinking? Couldn't they see? But then, I could ask that question concerning pretty much everything in this film. I can't believe it was ever made. From the very beginning, when the first Englishmen set foot on land and are met by native Americans who already speak English, you know this is not going to have high, or even believable, standards. And were those boards making up the walls of the fort sawed at the local sawmill, or just picked up at Home Depot?

Now, the excuse of low budget can be used to explain a lot of things; but it can't explain a poor script, poor directing and poor acting. There are plenty of great films out there that were made on shoe string budgets. But I think the motivation here is not to produce a great film, but just to have an excuse for Miles O'Keeffe to take off his shirt and a  beautiful woman to gush over him. Which, in addition to everything else, cheapens the story of Pocahantas and John Smith.

If you want to watch a movie about Pocahantas, watch Disney's version; or, better yet, Last of the Mohicans, which is still the best movie about native Americans and the settlement of this country. If you want to watch a bad wig destroy a performance (Tony Goldwyn's - although I think his accent, the director and the script all helped), watch this movie. Then follow it with Sword of the Valiant and just make it a bad wig/bad movie night.
