8523656,5,B0080QOJW6,"Virginia O'Brien's film debut. The wonderful Virginia O'Brien has two songs in her first movie. Her memorable performances here would set the course for her years at MGM. There was only one Virginia O'Brien. And there was only Frank Morgan! As always, he is a delight in his bumbling portrayal of an out of work actor who is a legend in his own mind. The perfect Morgan role.

Look for ""MGM's Deadpan Diva: Virginia O'Brien"". This, my third book, is the authorized biography of the beautiful ""deadpan"" singer. It will be published by BearManor Media later in 2016.",1454198400,,564,4.755102040816326

8523658,3,B0080QOJW6,This is an okay little comedy with a bunch of bit roles for either up and comers like Dailey or supporting stars like O'Brien & Burke.  The lead turn goes to Frank Morgan for a change and he is his usual entertaining self but the voice-over dubs of other MGM stars is a little silly at times.  The treat of the film is a number of small musical performances and the appearance of comedic character stars like Donald Meek.,1423180800,,421,4.3164556962025316
8523659,5,B0080QOJW6,"There were so many talented people presented in this film that it is worth watching many times.  Frank Morgan's ""impersonations"" were hilarious, and there were some truly fabulous performers to showcase the behind-the-scenes activities of the heyday of radio days.  It is a must-have addition to a DVD collection of that era.",1365465600,,325,5.230769230769231
8523660,4,B0080QOJW6,"A very funny movie of 1940.  Frank Morgan is charming as is the rest of the cast.  Many fun moments in a radio studio when Frank lipsyncs to the voices of Hedy Lamarr, Charles Boyer, Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.  Great family fun from the innocent days of Hollywood.  A very sharp black and white transfer. Highly recommended as an escape from the troubles of the world in 2012!",1356220800,,399,4.577464788732394
