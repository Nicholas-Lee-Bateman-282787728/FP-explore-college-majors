8306612,4,B000GDH9MI,"""End of Days,"" the conclusion to ""Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok,"" is considerably darker and less light-hearted overall than the preceding volumes.  The quality of the animation and the English-version subbing and dubbing remains unchanged, however, and the rapid (and sometimes short-lived) transitions between silly and serious go smoothly and manage not to feel out of place.  Despite the downward-spiral of doom and gloom of the later Loki episodes, the series manages a fairly cheerful ending that doesn't feel rushed or forced. Like most anime series, Loki does not so much end as stop, leaving the viewer wondering if there is a ""Loki 2"" in the works, but the anticlimactic ending is a typical anime malady, and the end-of-series let-down is not as pronounced in Loki as it is in other series.",1171929600,6,803,5.122137404580153
