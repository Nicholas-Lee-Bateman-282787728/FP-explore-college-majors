1645838,3,B00005QAP8,"Josh Holloway is smoking in this film done before he made a splash in the hit series Lost. But the plot to this movie is predictable and not exectued well. The love scene between Josh and Nastasia Kinski (or her body double) is very hot, and the acting is good on all accounts. It's worth a look if you like any of the stars in it.",1128038400,4,331,4.03030303030303
1645839,3,B00005QAP8,"Husband Jeff Fahey (Lawnmower Man, Quick) is married to the beautiful Nastassja Kinski (Paris, Texas, One Night Stand). Kinski gets a new assistant at work, played by the awesome Josh Holloway (TV'S LOST, the upcoming Whisper). Holloway gets near Kinski, getting to know her and when they go on a business trip, the 2 of them end up in a steamy sexual situation but Kinski doesnt want this so she tries to break it off with him but ""bad boy"" Holloway won't take no for an answer as he becomes obsessed with her. Fahey plays another bastard...he's usual plays bastards in movies, plus he's miscast. Kinski has some nice steamy scenes with Holloway and by herself as well. Cold Heart isn't the best thriller out there but it sure was entertaining to me.",1120176000,,751,4.654135338345864
1645840,5,B00005QAP8,"I really liked this movie.  Even with Jeff Fahey looking ill and  somewhat seedy.  I'm not sure what that's about but don't count on him for the interest.  He's necessary to the plot!  Natassja Kinski is beautiful as always and sexy to the nth degree.  The real eye candy in this film is this young man, Josh Holloway.  Money bones with the square jaw and chin, and dimples you could fall into.  I've never seen him before so it was a real treat for me. True, the story is pretty predictable.  The erotic scenes between Kinski & Holloway are very intense. Great chemistry here. To me, Holloway was the most impressive in his role.  He does a great job of portraying a psycho who is used  by the good psychiatrist Fahey who tries to manipulate him into killing  his wife for her money. You love and hate this psycho all within a matter of minutes.  But I think it is primarily because this movie depicts him being used and abused by the doctor/husband and you feel sorry for him. Holloway has a real talent for conveying anything and everything with just a look.  Just pure entertainment.  I think you'll enjoy it.",1092355200,21,1113,4.467661691542289
1645841,3,B00005QAP8,"its about Kinski whos married and a buisnesswoman to Jeff Fahey([*** of a ***]in this movie). Kinski sorta has her fling with Josh Holloway and he won't leave her alone, when Holloway stares dead on its creepy, man he is creepy. highlights would be Kinski's nude scenes defenitly, ohh my godess",1067040000,,294,4.784313725490196
1645842,5,B00005QAP8,"Okay, so I'm hooked. I just don't get enough performances out of my fave star. It's just not my fault. This quirky film treats us to some new twists of some old games. Did somebody say ""Murder?"" Even the missus liked this psychological thriller (she always likes films where the protagonist is slowly driven insane). Jeff Fahey (the Lawnmower Man himself) and Nastassia Kinski (Cat People)also deliver the goods. Hey, I think I'll go re-watch my DVD right now.",1037404800,3,460,4.8354430379746836
1645843,4,B00005QAP8,"As I never expect a lot from indie thrillers, this one was far better than I thought. Although the twists and turns were not quite unpredictable, they still got you some way or another. Also, enjoy a good performance (and some real nice body shots) given by Nastassja Kinsky if you're a fan of hers. To me Nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed. Josh Holloway (playing the psycho depressed hunk) was fine too. I would give this movie 5 stars if they cast someone more convincing (like William H. Macy) in the place of Jeff Fahey. But, as I said, I never expect a lot....",1009929600,9,620,4.447368421052632

1645855,1,B00005QAP8,It's dated and cheesy with poor production values. The acting is good and the plot line looked interesting but some films just simply don't hold up to the present values and this is one of them.,1392940800,3,194,4.416666666666667

1645857,2,B00005QAP8,"Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid When I stop beating myself in the head with a brick for actually watching this to the end I may revise my review.  But please, don't hold your breath.  I will not be responsible for anything turning blue. Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid.  I'll bet 'dimples' does a good Jack Nicholson imitation at parties. Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid. In my defense it's 45 below here and a cat, blanket, and cappuccino go quite well with Lifetime movies.  Just not this one.

1645859,4,B00005QAP8,The unknown in this was great. Just when I thought she was wrong about her husband I was right all alone. Fun to know the outcome. MCG,1387497600,,134,4.0

1645861,3,B00005QAP8,"I don't know why some people believe this movie is worth more than three stars. The movie is more boring than interesting. If you doubt my opinion about this film, then watch it yourself.",1382486400,,187,4.529411764705882
1645862,5,B00005QAP8,"Cold Heart was a movie that you get caught in, you don't  want to miss anything.  It had murder, suspense, deceptions, and love, but was like a twisting road keeping you turning.  I loved it and saw it two more times.

1645863,4,B00005QAP8,Cute movie but predictable with the plot and a little cheesy by today's standards.  The one saving grace was Josh Holloway.  He stole every scene and was the driving force behind this movie.  When he was not onscreen then it got a little boring for me.  Cute movie and glad I watched it.,1371772800,,287,4.3584905660377355
1645874,5,B00005QAP8,"..you'll love this movie!!  Good script good story and good actors.  Jeff Fahey also in it, another ""Lost"" pal great to see them together pre Lost",1367625600,,146,4.576923076923077
1645875,5,B00005QAP8,"The movie was quite predictable to a point. I wasn't expecting the surprise ending but what I loved about it was Josh Holloways great one liners like in The Show LOST. My favorite and it made me laugh was when he said""Talk about a quicky divorce"" That was great!",1363305600,,262,4.36734693877551

1645878,5,B00005QAP8,"well, well, well, to tell you honestly, I bought This DVD coz i am a BIIIIG fan of Lostie Sawyer(Josh HOlloway), and i couldn't find a torrent link to this movie. I live in India and spent about 12$(Including transport) to get a hand to it. Was the DVD worth it??
Hell, it is...
What an awesome Psycho-thriller...its so good.

Nastassja Kinski- i saw her for the first time and Boy!!she is beautiful...

Talking About Josh Holloway, He is phenomenal. I've seen some of the other low-budget movies starring Josh Holloway from his Pre-Lost Era. They were pretty bad, but josh was ok in all of them. So i didn't expect much from this movie either, but this time, i was pleasantly surprised. I guess Josh Should be Proud of his performance considering it was his first movie. He just Rocks the role.

Guys(and Gals especially), if you are a True Sawyer(josh Holloway) Fan, don't rent it...dont download it...BUY IT...Its worth having it in your collection.
This movie deserved more respect than it actually got. Obviously Josh wasn't a big name then, and Nastassja is no Julia Roberts or Anjelina Jolie or Kate Winslet. So i guess it couldn't pull as much publicity and crowd as it deserved. But Cold Heart DVD definately deserves to be a part of your collection...more so if you are a Holloway Fan.
Go Buy It.",1300320000,8,1306,4.645021645021645

and this is not just some cliche' thriller movie

1645880,4,B00005QAP8,"If you saw her early work(tess and cat people) you would understand, she should have done te nude scenes herself-her body is still great",1285372800,,136,4.708333333333333
1645881,4,B00005QAP8,"I watched this movie because Josh Holloway is in it.  I really didn't expect much from it, although I've seen other ""B"" movies Josh was in, and his acting is what redeems the movie.  But I have to say, this one was pretty darn good!  Better than expected with a surprising ending which I will not give away, but I will tell you this much:  The review by Ang Poon Kah is inaccurate.  Please don't watch the movie expecting it to end the way she says.  Definitely worth having for any Josh Holloway fan.",1260748800,2,501,4.276595744680851
1645882,5,B00005QAP8,"This fim is basically like a psycological thriller where this psychotic man has certain taste of women whom are married and he ended up been locked up after he use knife to assault the first lady where she is a married woman. The layer bailed him out and he worked in a company ended up witha second woman whose husband is a lawyer that bailed him out. I am not going to elaborate the story further or else not nice but the story ended up the layer died and the psychotic man also dead from gunshot shot by the layer's wife. Very interesting story and is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film/movie.
