8120835,3,B000FCQSJU,"As far as the footage of glowsticking goes...this video is poorly made. You could make a better video with your cell phone. The instructional section on how to glowstick is pretty good info, and the only reason this didn't get a 2 star review. Whoever made this is definitely passionate about their topic but their video making skills leave something to be desired.",1457827200,,365,4.809523809523809
