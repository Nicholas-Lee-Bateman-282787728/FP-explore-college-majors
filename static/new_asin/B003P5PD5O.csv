I love that the characters are ""balloons"". It's so original and entertaining for both kids and adults.",1278460800,,276,4.226415094339623
8401887,5,B003P5PD5O,"Okay so my youngest son loves balloons so I knew he would love this DVD and anyways how could anyone not like superheros made of balloons?  The DVD is adorable and quick, probably over too quick which is the only flaw.  We have re-watched the two episodes on the DVD over and over, some more episodes would have been nice!  The characters are all brightly colored and animated, and I love the music in the background.  My sons love all the balloon characters, especially little Leaky!  Before this DVD, I had never heard of Balloonatiks, but they actually have a few books, comics, games and a whole interactive world to explore online.

I think the episodes are funny and honestly don't mind watching them with my boys.  It is a nice break from all the popular characters they watch.  The episodes are about fighting a villain but it is not your typical villain fighting but it is cute and appropriate for kids.",1276992000,,912,4.58641975308642
8401888,5,B003P5PD5O,"I am very excited to share with you a new DVD called ""Balloonatiks: The Collector's Set"". We just finished watching and and my 4 year old daughter sat still the whole time enthralled with the video. And as an adult I even was in to it. In fact we are watching it for the second time in a row right now. To quote my daughter ""You know what mommy? I want to get another one of these.""

This cartoon is cute and not cheesy like I thought it could be. The theme song is even very catchy. There are two episodes on this DVD totaling 23 minutes. It's nice to have them short and sweet and not be stuck with an hour long movie. If you need a few minutes to keep the kids occupied while you do something around the house this DVD is perfect.

There is nothing scary on here and is very kid friendly. I give it an A+.
