8574826,3,B00BWS6KVC,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...TNA Final Resolution 2012. The Kaz-James Storm match Worked to protect Storm's injured ribs, a fine TV style match, unfortunately this is PPV. The X-Division title match between RVD & Kenny King was a bit sloppy at times, but a fine TV style match but again unfortunately this is PPV. The World Tag Team title match between Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez against Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan was More of the same, not bad, a bit sloppy at times, but more of a TV style match than a PPV match. See a pattern here? The Bully Ray-Austin Aries match was a Good match even with the bad finish. The Knocksout title match between Tara & Mickie James was pretty good match even if we did see too much Jesse. The 8 man tag team match between Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Garett Bischoff and Wes Briscoe against Four Members of Aces and 8s (Doc, Devon, Masked Man and Masked Man) was another solid, but unspectacular match. The AJ Styles-Christopher Daniels match was a really good match, but the crowd did it no favors, which is a shame and the story of the night. The World title match between Jeff Hardy & Bobby Roode was another good match that was hurt by the crowd. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1419465600,,1233,4.341991341991342

8574829,4,B00BWS6KVC,"James Storm vs. Kazarian - This was a last minute bonus match that saw some nice pre-match back & forth interaction on the microphone setting this up.  They went back & forth from the very beginning before Kaz was able to get an advantage working over his neck with a springboard legdrop, twisting neck vice & DDT before Storm was able to comeback with impactful moves like the Alabama Slam, Closing Time, and able to counter the Fade To Black with his Last Call.  This was a fun last minute back & forth match that did it's job in getting the crowd hot.

X Division Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Kenny King - RVD started out focusing on King's legs with his various kicks while also using moves like the legdrag & low dropkick before King was able to gain the advantage dropkicking RVD off the top rope onto the guardrail then grounding RVD on the mat including a variation of the chinlock before RVD made a come back using his ""educated feet.""  This was a solid match & one of the better RVD matches in recent months.

Tag Team Champions Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan - Two similar sets based off looks alone that started off with stalemates between the two biggest men in the match before Morgan was able to take down Hernandez only for Ryan to tag back in causing Hernandez & Chavo to get the advantage back by singling out the smaller guy on the team.  Morgan was able to interject himself on the apron & use the same strategy of singling out the smaller member of the team in Chavo to dominate in the ring with Ryan tagging in to get the pin after Morgan did the work.  This was the only designed to start the feud between the two teams & did it's job in showcasing Morgan & Hernandez as a powerful big men.

Bully Ray vs. Austin Aries - Aries started out playing the ""cat & mouse"" game of constantly avoiding Bully & stalling causing Bully to chase him around before finally catching up to him & tossing him around only for Aries to fight back with various elbows & forearms to the head mocking Hulk Hogan in the process.  Bully came back with moves like the running splash, snake eyes, his own missile dropkick, and catching Aries with a big boot when he went for the suicide dive while Aries gained the momentum back with a drop toehold into the outside steps that busted Bully open above the eye & continued to work it over causing Brooke Hogan to come to ringside.  This was a very good match because it was a completely different encounter from their previous PPV match months earlier while Bully did some moves that we've rarely seen from him while Aries was able to keep pushing the issue during the match between Bully & The Hogans.

Knockouts Champion Tara vs. Mickie James - Both women started out exchanging holds with Tara resorting to her superior power while Mickie relied on rollups, suplexes, and later a frankensteiner out of the corner.  Jesse to cause a distraction allowing Tara to gain the advantage using a body scissors & full nelson combination before Mickie made a comeback with moves like the top rope Thesz Press to the outside.  This didn't match the level of their previous series back in 2010 but they still worked hard & one of the stronger knockouts matches in recent memory however Velvet Sky returned to TNA the week before & the pre-match video & Tara's promo was all about Sky's return to you pretty much knew who was going to win this match going in.

Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Garett Bischoff, Wes Brisco vs. Aces & Eights (Devon, D.O.C., Two Masked Members) - Angles team was dominate early with Wes & Garett standing out with their teamwork before Aces & Eights had to resort to tactics like triple teaming behind the referee's back to regain the advantage with Devon only tagging in whenever Joe was down before Joe made a dominate comeback before eventually all 8 men got involved leading to one impactful move after another.  It was a solid match that was one of the best matches involving Garett Bischoff while Wes Brisco looked good at times as well.

A.J. Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - This was built up as their final match with the special stipulation in that it could only end with a pinfall or submission.  Both men started out hot with Daniles taking Styles down followed by mat wrestling before they worked into a slow methodical pace that saw Styles execute a snap suplex on the apron with Daniels comeback later with a rock bottom on the apron.  Daniels took control working over Styles back with a slam on the steps, moonsault directly to the back, a variation of the crossface, and half nelson before both men had the same idea of a running crossbody resulting in a crash & burn that resulted in Styles being busted open on the side of his eye but A.J. came back with his flying forearm, head scissors takedown, reverse DDT, and Styles Clash.  This was their best one on one encounter in this feud since Daniels return in 2011 outside of their two Destination X matches because it was so physical & continued to tell the story in regards to A.J. Styles.

TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Bobby Roode - Despite the fact that James Storm won the contenders match the previous month, he won the title shot from Storm at the next Impact here while on the previous Impact revealed that he had payed off Aces & Eights to attack Hardy causing him to come into this match sore.  Roode worked over Hardy's midsection with constant kicks, shoulder blocks in the corner, knees & double axe handles to the back before Hardy was able to start get some quick offense in with Roode sidestepping him leading to a crash & burn on the outside but Hardy fought back with his daredevil offense including the Wisper In The Wind, and splashes off the rope including one that ended up hurting himself.  Both men continued to trade momentum with Roode catching Hardy with the spinebuster, Hardy with a Twist Of Fate knocking Roode to the outside, Hardy's leaping leg lariat that send Hard into the front row, swanton bomb, and a spear by Roode.  This was the best singles match between these two men as it was very strong from start to finish with the storytelling on Hardy's part coming into play.

This was another strong PPV showing by TNA that I would check out.",1365379200,2,6220,4.513345195729538
