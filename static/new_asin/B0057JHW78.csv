Director Thomas Arslan is a respected professor of film in Berlin, who makes very understated films that I appreciate aethetically, although they're not my personal cup of tea. This film is no exception. It is NOT a documentary, but has the meandering feeling of one. We follow three siblings (the literal meaning of the title) whose mother is German while their father is a Turkish immigrant; the marriage is clearly under strain. One of the sons seems on track to succeed in German society, as he is enrolled in a college preparatory school (Gymnasium) and we often see him studying. The sister is pursing an apprenticeshipe as a seamstress; although she seems to have no real interest in this line of work, she is moving towards independence and making plans to get an apartment with a friend. The third son is the ""problem child""; he has dropped out of school and receives a summons to join the Turkish military. This may be confusing to the viewer; the children most likely have dual citizenship in both Germany and Turkey, which means it wold be relatively simple for this young man to avoid conscription by renouncing his Turkish citizenship and becoming ""just"" a German, which is clearly what his mother would prefer. The father, on the other hand, is proud of his son and reminisces about his own military service. Personally I get the feeling that the military may be exactly what this alienated young man needs (although his brother points out that he isn't really fluent in Turkish). But the film leaves all of the outcomes up in the air: we never see him actually IN the military, nor do we see the sister move out, nor the other brother complete his studies and go on to university, and we certainly don't see the parents resolve their issues. So the film remains a ""slice of life,"" full of rich details and topics for discussion, but without the plot resolution many viewers may expect.",1427500800,,2168,4.722955145118734
