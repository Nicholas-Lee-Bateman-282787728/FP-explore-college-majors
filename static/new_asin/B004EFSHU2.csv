8426911,2,B004EFSHU2,"Even if the routines are solid, I just can't get past that this DVD has no chapter selection, so if you want to do the last routine you'll have to fast forward through all the others...who has the time or patience for that?  Seems a bit ridiculous to update the workouts but stick with outdated technology that renders the whole DVD pretty useless...it will either be going back or put in the yard sale bin.",1471737600,,407,4.426666666666667
8426912,4,B004EFSHU2,"This DVD presents four different abs-based routines. I've done the whole DVD through a few times and it definitely tones and tightens my mid-section. Collage video has this listed as Beginner/Intermediate, but as an intermediate exerciser, I still found that a lot of these moves were quite challenging.

You will not need weights or equipment. Most routines run a little over ten minutes.

Routine 1: Jeanette Jenkins
Jeanette leads you through several bootcamp-inspired moves, including some plank modifications that had me gasping for air. She does a great job of taking familiar exercises and altering them so that you feel the burn a little deeper or in a slightly different place, and her enthusiasm is infectious.

Routine 2: Tara Stiles
Tara takes a yogic approach to the abs. If you're not familiar with her training, Tara's yoga is fast-paced flowing, with a focus on flexibility. If you're expecting a break from Jeanette, don't look for it here, because Tara's routine is HARD.

Routine 3: Katrina Hodgson & Karena Dawn
These girls are a fun pair to work out with. They lead you through plyometric circuits, and have a very sweet and encouraging demeanor. I found the V-Sit to be a very challenging move by the third circuit.

Routine 4: Kamala Mathis
Kamala's workout is really focused on elongating the abs and she uses a lot of Pilates-based moves in her approach. It's a really nice complement to the crunching exercises of Katrina & Karena.

Each of these routines is uniquely challenging and offers a different approach to targeting the ab muscles. I deduct a star for a couple reasons. This DVD has one of the most basic menus I have ever seen. It's literally just a ""Play"" button. I'm really surprised that they didn't take the time to provide a chapter menu so that exercisers could choose a routine. Also, the music and basic studio setting are pretty uninspiring. Once I know the moves better, I'm sure I can just listen to my own soundtrack, but still...

Regardless, these instructors and exercises are wonderful and if you're really looking to work your core in every concievable way, this is a great DVD for your library.",1331164800,20,2148,4.868493150684931
