8613297,3,B00F98FO4U,"When Angela washes up on the beach, a detective (Fabio Testi)  investigates a girl's school with a lack of social graces. The plot wasn't half bad, what there was of it. The film had that same wonderful substandard dubbing we have come to accept with questionable restoration. On the plus side the film boasts ample gratuitous teen full frontal nudity.

Thankfully I didn't pay much for it but I still feel ripped off. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves for this shoddy product.",1428969600,3,264,4.638297872340425

8613302,4,B00F98FO4U,"Inspector Gianni Di Salvo  (Fabio Testi) is on the case, after a 16yo girls battered body is found wrapped in plastic. He discovers that the girl's name was Angela, and she was part of a group of friends from a private high school. Soon, Angela's friends as well as the school faculty become suspects. Of course, Di Salvo is told that since the school is run by the church, the police are under pressure to close the case quickly, solved or not, to avoid scandal. Can the Inspector crack the case in time? More deaths occur, interrupting Di Salvo's love life.  The mysterious, black-gloved killer is only shown through extreme close-ups of one of his / her eyeballs. TRAUMA (aka: RING OF FEAR) is an interesting police procedural / giallo. The most ""shocking"" part of the film involves alternating scenes between an orgy and an abortion! Trust me, the two do NOT go well together! Contains copious nudity...",1401580800,2,907,4.734177215189874
8613303,2,B00F98FO4U,"Here is another rare Euro Giallo released by Full Moon Pictures Grindhouse Collection , Director Alberto Negrin's 'TRAUMA' aka
'ENIGMA ROSSO' aka 'RING OF FEAR' -1978,  a rather dull affair centering around a female college.  Popular for his time Euro actor Fabio Testi  plays hard as nails Inspector Desalvo trying to solve the slice and dice murders intertwined between gratuitously nude young teens and an almost unrecognizable Christine Kaufman.  Cameos by Euro cult actors Jack Taylor , beautiful Silvia Aguilar who would grace Actor Paul Naschy's 'NIGHT OF THE WEREWOLF' aka 'EL RETORNO DEL HOMBRE LOBO'-1981  and the gorgeous Helga Line try to spice up the proceedings but to no avail.  The box lists venerable American actor Arthur Kennedy in the credits but is nowhere to be found, obviously the archivists(?) at Full Moon mistook actor Ivan Desny for Kennedy.  Director Negrin was a TV director in Italy and tries to convey some stylish set pieces but fails due to a lack of budget.  The lackluster score by composer Riz Ortolani (one of his worst) doesn't help matters.  The film would probably score more stars if it was presented in better quality for the viewer.  Full Moon should be ashamed in releasing the film in such a full blown screen transfer that the images of Photographer Eduardo Noe are completely lost to the viewer as the landscapes become a pan and scan mish-mosh of stagnation.  I have to say that Full Moon does have a disclaimer before the film stating the Grindhouse Collection has assembled these titles from old negatives and lost footage where they had to go back to 30 year old master and VHS transfers. After viewing this DVD, that is truly an understatement.  Some of the scenes are difficult to figure out as the full screen image blocks out so much of the side action that you really can't figure out what you are seeing especially in night or dark scenes.  As a film, the affair is strictly routine obviously hampered by this slipshod presentation.  Trailers for other Full Moon titles and a two minute forgettable featurette on their releases round out the mix.  The two stars are for the comprehension of some of the set pieces that occurred or could be deciphered otherwise if you enjoy watching those old pan and scan Wizard Video VHS transfers where the images actually blur into blue grain, then this is for you.  Until a better transfer comes along (wishful thinking in some cases) this purchase is strictly for Euro cult completists only .",1387843200,8,2489,4.834905660377358
