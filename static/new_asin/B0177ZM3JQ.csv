7491613,4,B0177ZM3JQ,Daddy's home it is funny movie and it's not that bad I saw it and it is so funny and it is still in second place in the box office,1451779200,2,130,3.3666666666666667
7491614,1,B0177ZM3JQ,"Most of the comedy doesn't work, and the reason is because it's so overplayed throughout that it becomes impossible to be emotionally invested in Will Ferrell's character. It's not that Ferrell's style of comedy--fanatical, enthusiastic, hapless--is inherently ineffective, but there's not one moment where I felt genuine sympathy for his idiotic character. I wonder why National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is today considered a classic when I feel it has the same basic flaw. Also, the humor in this tends to be much more crude than I'd want. There are a few gags which could work well in this, even in their extremes of physical comedy, but they would have to be used more sparingly and be centered around developments in the relationships of the characters. There would need to be an element of tension to the relationships which would be either heightened or defused by the absurd physical comedy. I don't see anything funny about physical comedy unless it is connected to something of more substance in the story. The whole movie is just a constant back-and-forth between Will Ferrell realizing he needs to stand up to Mark Wahlberg and Mark Wahlberg manipulating him in some way which is hard to believe. I guess what's hardest to believe is that Ferrell doesn't seem to know when to restrain his style, because he can be really funny, such as in Elf--a character whom you develop an affinity for when watching it--but when he's totally stupid, like in this, he's impossible to identify with. I see a lot of similarity between this movie and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in the crudeness, the issue of a dad who can't seem to assert his authority effectively, the physical comedy being overblown and not relevant to developing the relationships in the story, and the absurd degree to which everyone seems to be okay with what's going on. The kids in this movie are one-dimensional and basically just go back and forth between saying they hate or love their step-dad, who's Will Ferrell, and are easily manipulated by Mark Wahlberg trying to win back their favor. Wahlberg is trying to return to his former wife, who's now married to Ferrell, because he wants to prove to her that he can be a good dad to the son and daughter, after he'd previously abandoned them. The kids have no emotional development whatsoever. As for Wahlberg's acting and the wife's, it's not as overblown as Ferrell's, but their characters are one-dimensional also: confident at all times. It's not very interesting.

This movie is a comedic bomb.",1451692800,7,2538,4.929906542056075

She was quite happy to receive it as a gift and I have already pre-ordered the sequel, which is similarly redicilous with some quite humorous parts! Check it out!

I only gave it 4 stars because while it is enjoyable, I don't think its quite there. 4 Star as a movie, 5 Star as a gift for someone who is a fan and doesnt currently own it! By the way, if you have Amazon Prime, I think you can stream it right now for free. So if you're not sure if you want to own a hard copy, go stream it first and check it out!

This movie is representative of the poor quality, non-redemptive garbage that makes up 99% of everything Hollywood produces. Foul-mouthed Hollywood cynics, immoral people with no class, no  values, and no acting skills have become the norm since the 1980s, and they are incapable of producing a movie of any value.

Although it is slightly amusing to watch entertainers play out their degenerate lives in the press, each attempting to out-do the other in their profligate, scheming lives, their movies have long-since ceased to be entertaining; in addition, their desire to win acclaim through 'shock-value'  has made their movies entirely unwatchable, with all of the violence, anger, and wickedness portrayed on the screen. As far as the personal behavior of these people - I do not know what's worse, the degenerate, filthy directors or the scheming, prurient-minded actors who would do anything to ""get the part"". It is just laughable to watch them fling accusations of abuse and protests of innocence at one-another, all the while noting that 'without one you cannot have the other'.

7492709,3,B0177ZM3JQ,"This video is funny, has comedic value, but teaches you valuable lessons.

Mothers, who have recently been with someone else, ends up with bad boys types in the movies.  They have kids by those bad boys but they eventually up and leave for long periods of time.  This is a reflection of the times today, as there are single mothers out there who have had kids by multiple fathers, who are bad boys by nature, and refuse to participate in being a real dad to those kids.

Then there's the horror stories of step dads who have faced constant criticism, rejection, and spiteness from the children of the distant fathers.  While Will Farrell plays up this up-beat stepdad, he's altogether a mirror of the stepdads who have tried to be there for the children that are not theirs.

While a funny comedy, it reminds me too much of life itself where the cycle of single mothers chasing after ""reliable"", ""well to do"", and ""financially stable"" single men to become ""dads"" to the children that their bad boys left.  I should know because I have been chased after by single mothers.  I should know because those single mothers decided to chase after a bad boy first before getting with someone who's childless, hadn't been a father, and hadn't had a long-term relationship.",1500681600,,1262,4.678733031674208

7492732,3,B0177ZM3JQ,"I had low hopes for this movie but the buses I ride always played it and I eventually gave the movie the doubt. The plot is rather curious where Will Ferrel is this over-the-top wannabe super dad but he's unfortunately sterile due to medical malpractice. He marries a lovely woman who has two children from a previous marriage. He feels like his life is awesome... but unfortunately the kids seem to hate him and claim he's a dork.

Will's character is such a doormat that he couldn't care less and hopes the kids will like him someday.

And then BAM! He gets a phone call from the biological father who is on a plane right now to greet his children without warning. Will reluctantly arrives at the airport to take the guy to his home but Mark Wahlberg merly mocks him and arrives on his motorcycle. Angered and hurt from the slight, Will realizes Mark's bad boy coolness is not only causing the kids to hate him even more, but his own wife seems to tolerate Mark living in the garage. Worried his wife is capable of divorcing him to remarry her lazy bum but sexy ex, he asks his boss for help. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned and his boss finds Mark to be a really cool guy and offers conflicting advice.

Hurt and alone, Mark unexpectedly offers Will the chance to get an appointment with one of the best IVF doctors in the country with the malignant plan of stalling any hopes Will has to have biological kids. Things don't go as planned and Will impregnantes his wife. The two guys start to realize each of them have good and bad things and oddly enough end up as friends.

While I find the character interaction between the two to have stellar moments, some scenes are ridiculous. Will causes a motorcycle to jump 10 feet into the air and crash into two plastered walls of his house? Will's heart stops for 5 minutes and after Mark saves his life, he doesn't end up in the ER?

The tolerance of Will's wife of allowing her ex to stay in the garage seems ridiculous given Mark isn't dirt poor and she seems oblivious of Will's feelings. Moreover, while Will has some funny scenes with his step-son, the daughter's conflicts are menial in comparison and slow the movie.

While not Will Ferrel's best film, it has a lot of good scenes and offers some good laughs. I personally like the ending a lot.",1500076800,,2311,4.464454976303317

Movie depicts an effeminate, white knighting, mangina step-dad trying to keep sperm-donor 'Chad' dad's rugrats engaged and in the just-one-big-happy-family zone.
In real life would advise the step-dad wanna-be to never become the step-dad if sperm-donor 'Chad' dad is alive. Also to be aware that in mom's eyes her new marriage is about 'her' kids, not the husband & wife, and the new hubby is ranked below 'her' kids and just above the dog, maybe.

7492970,4,B0177ZM3JQ,"I'll give it 4 stars. The story line is great and the kids did an awesome job, but some scenes were just really corny and dumb. Especially when Brad drove Dusty's motorcycle in the house and jumped out on his car. Also the ending was corny, but smart. Although I'm glad it didn't end with the kids watching violence. I know kids hear all sorts of language and I know most of them repeat it (I repeated some as a kid), but I can't stand movies where kids are cussing. This movie makes sense and I felt bad for Brad and angry at Dusty. Was happy to see them getting along finally. I don't have any kids, so I don't know from the point of view of the struggles of parents and step parents, but this movie does bring light to the situations and feelings some parents may go through. You have to figure out how to get along with the other parents and find peace. I am happy to watch a movie that brings light to the subjects about bullying and standing up for yourself and fighting for what's right, but wondered why the parents didn't go to the school and demand more done about the bullying. Sometimes you may need to take matters into your own hands, but too many kids these days think bullying is fun and fighting is the answer. Growing up, bullying wasn't really an issue. Today that's all we hear about. There were some really funny moments and jaw dropping shocking moments, but overall a great film. I always heard it was a great film and just now getting around to watching it. I would watch this again, but it's not on my priority watch list to see again and again. Maybe to see Wahlberg. He's always been a hottie. Grew up lovin him. The ending was corny, but that shows you karma always comes back around.",1496016000,,1712,4.303405572755418

I know him through his stand up voice so it could be just a crossing of media genres that throws me off, but he didn't serve any useful or funny purpose in this movie. Movies don't seem to utilize his talents as he just seems like a stand in but got the part for his ""in the moment / trending"" comedic popularity.

There were times when you just want to slap Will Ferrell's character and say, ""snap out of it!"" but is makes him all the more loveable.

The only down side is, this could have actually been a great family movie, if not for the one doctor visit scene. That scene was very adult and sort of out of place in the contexts of the entire movie. And it went on for ever. The kids actors are great.  Linda Cardellini is good too.

With two distinctly different personalities the extremes of each person trying to compete in the other one's world instead of just being themselves makes for some silly moments and yet it demonstrates how these two men deal with their own insecurities.  And in the end they recognize that the other's personality traits have value in creating that modern family that does not necessarily follow the stereotype TV family of the sixties that was portrayed on television.,1485302400,,685,5.053097345132743
