8316898,3,B0001YJ4M0,I thought it fell short on speaking about any of the Martial Artist from the Midwest like the famous The Baker Brothers(Master Preston Baker or Master Otis Baker) or Master Jimmy Jones or Master Shorty Mills or Master Tola Naa to name a few...,1269561600,,243,4.545454545454546
8316899,5,B0001YJ4M0,"I read the other 2 reviews and they gave it high praise. I ordered the dvd and wasn't disappointed at all. It is definitely a keeper. You won't find these videos anywhere else that I'm aware of. My husband was in awe over the fighting sequences and I must admit I didn't think it would be so good but it was. If you like martial arts, you will love this old video of the legends, Chuck Norris, Jim Kelly and so much other. I was looking for more when the end came. That was the only thing I was disappointed with. I wanted more. I hope someone make another video like this one.",1210118400,,577,4.115044247787611
