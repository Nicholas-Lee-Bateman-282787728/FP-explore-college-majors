8154860,2,B000K7UHJW,"A low budget ""C"" grade movie. Insomniacs might find it useful as a sleep aid. This was Mel Gibson's movie debut, but everyone has to start somewhere.",1385769600,,149,4.555555555555555
8154861,5,B000K7UHJW,I really enjoyed Summer City. The main reason for buying it is that I'm a die hard Mel Gibson fan. His movies always have a lot of action. I would recommend it to any Mel Gibson fan and anyone that likes movies with a lot of action.,1357344000,,232,3.9574468085106385
8154862,1,B000K7UHJW,"The main selling point of this DVD is that it stars Mel Gibson.  This has to be one of Gibson's very first films - even before the ROAD WARRIOR movies.  The shot of Gibson that is on the cover is dated much later than the young, skinny actor who appears in this movie.  Also, Gibson only has a supporting role in the film.  To surmise that he's the leading actor would be incorrect.
Not a whole lot happens with the plot, so they seemingly stretch just about every scene out to make it ""feature length.""  They also throw in a lot of scenes apparently at random without any thought to story cohesion.
Of course, the film is also about as low budget as low-budget movies get.  I swear at times I thought I was watching a film made by a bunch of high schoolers.  The picture quality is pretty rough - even by 1970s standards.
The only people who just might like to pick up this DVD are die-hard Gibson fans.  There are those who might enjoy seeing him in a movie filmed in his native Australia where he still has his thick native accent.  So, with that in mind, there are perhaps some who might find some nostalgia in buying this one.
If Gibson had not starred in this movie, I very much doubt it would have ever made it to DVD in the 1st place.  This is an obscure movie, and clearly there is a REASON it's obscure:  it's dull, bland & boring!",1071878400,7,1341,4.219607843137255
8154863,4,B000K7UHJW,"A very interesting movie and great acting for a debut film, if you can get past the very odd camera angles and ocasional dumb old joke this is a worth while great film Mel Gibson all the way",997315200,3,190,4.026315789473684
8154864,1,B000K7UHJW,"The plot of the story was, i admit, enticing and well thought out. However, the film quality is horrible. Mel Gibson himself stated that he wished the film never saw daylight. It's a cheap flick you can find in bargain bins for a buck fifty, i know, thats where i got mine. The only reason it's part of my collection is because im a die hard and dedicated mel fan...thats it. You can't get through the entire movie without turning it off...the sound is horrible, and the picture is very unclear. Very low grade flick.",990662400,4,517,4.4526315789473685
