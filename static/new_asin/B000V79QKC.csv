8217000,3,B000V79QKC,"Andaaz is the earliest film I have seen featuring Priyanka Chopra, although she had appeared in two before this one according to her on-line biography.  Never-the-less, both she and Lara Dutta were ""introduced"" in this film, and they both received Filmfare Best Female Debut awards for their efforts.  However, the only really good parts of the film belong to Priyanka Chopra, and the best part of the film --by far!-- is Priyanka's dream sequence.  I believe this is the only time Priyanka has appeared on screen in a bikini, and it is one of the few times that she can be seen on film actually being kissed on the lips.  Priyanka was nominated for a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress award for this film.
The other memorable sequence in the movie is the song featuring both leading ladies; the audience can watch this dance and decide for itself which actress is more beautiful.  In the acting category, it is Priyanka, hands down, and explains how she got the sizzling role in Aitraaz the following year (a film for which she would again be nominated for Best Supporting Actress (she should have won) and  would win a Filmfare Best Villain award).
As a love story, the plot is flawed, and it is clear that Lara's character could never really have been in love with Raj, and this makes the contrived ending silly.  Of course, the whole idea that Raj would go out of his way to avoid Jiya's (Priyanka's) advances is silliness in the extreme.  I have read that Lara Dutta's voice was dubbed for this picture, although I have never found an explanation.  In any case, the film is worthwhile because it is the only time you will get to see a 20 year old Priyanka Chopra in a bikini.  For a great movie, watch Aitraaz, where Priyanka really sizzles!!",1299801600,2,1746,4.621359223300971
8217001,3,B000V79QKC,"This seemed pretty average and I found I wasn't convinced by the connection between the characters.
It was really Akshay's movie and he did a mature and good job of it. I didn't feel any real chemistry between he and Lara Dutta and I found her adequate but not as charismatic as other Bollywood women.
Priyanka is much more charismatic but this wasn't one of her better movies as she played a highly unlikable part earlier then snaps unexpectedly into nice girl with no real unfolding of that transition.
The script was problematic for this and a few other points. At one point Akshay in a rather unlikely move is guilt-tripped by unthinking relatives into accepting a marriage that looked pretty unsustainable at that point. The intent of the script had heart but heaved awkwardly around trying to bring that off.
Johnny Lever, the perpetual comic sidekick of Bollywood movies (he must be more in work than anyone else in the industry) played a sensitive addition to this one.
The song-dance numbers were really all duets and I didn't find the songs that memorable so I found my fingers itching on the fast forward to hasten their journey.
Look it was OK but overall I would have given it a 2 1/2 but Akshay's sense of presence and tackling of the part lifted it to the 3. Elsewhere on the Net it seems to get around average. Not a keeper.",1237075200,,1340,4.5875
8217002,3,B000V79QKC,First of all Akshay looked very good in this moviw. The love story was not original. Priyanka and lara looked very beautiful. The songs were nice. The only person I really enjoy watching was akshay Kumar. This guy is too good looking.,1190160000,,234,4.595238095238095
8217003,3,B000V79QKC,"They met when they were kids and from the moment Kaajal talked Raj into roller skating despite his having braces on his right leg, Raj has been madly in love with Kaajal. Ever since she was a young girl, Kaajal has had a fascination with airplanes, so Raj joins the Air Force to become a pilot and fulfill his childhood promise to her. But when he goes home on leave from the military, he finds to his dismay that Kaajal has met someone and is engaged. At the wedding, Kaajal discovers Raj's feelings for her but it is, of course, too late. They part ways.

It is on a New Year's Eve when Raj meets the sexy but inebriated Jiya (Priyanka Chopra) at a nightclub and unwillingly helps her out of a jam. Jiya falls for him and tries to catch his interest but to no avail. But, undaunted, the plucky Jiya presses on and eventually wears down the reluctant Raj. They get engaged and Jiya takes Raj to meet her parents, and this is where the improbable twist happens. I'll say no more.

ANDAAZ is a decent 2003 Bollywood film, made auspicious by the starring roles of both Miss Universe (2000) Lara Dutta and Miss World (also in 2000) Priyanka Chopra. This is, in fact, Lara Dutta's film debut. ANDAAZ tells of unrequited love and sacrifices made and how our lives and destinies are sometimes determined by our cultural trappings. This movie is very well served by Akshay Kumar's nuanced acting performance. The only other film in which I've seen Akshay Kumar is KHAKEE and I thought he was particularly good there, also. As Raj in ANDAAZ, Akshay shines. As Raj, he manifests such deep love and devotion for Kaajal, and he does this so convincingly, that his feelings are almost this palpable force. Poor dude. Even his bittersweet participation in the wedding musical number is a gut-churning thing to see. Even if the song has a nice melody and a worthy message: ""If you love someone, express it - before it's too late.""

Lara Dutta, for a first-timer, shows great promise. She delivers a performance distinguished with a decided demarcation: first, she is Kaajal the perky, strong-minded girl who doesn't hesitate to beat up on her buddy Raj, then later, she is Kaajal the mature and inconsolably heartbroken woman. Unfortunately, the uninhibited, sometimes childish role of Jiya negatively affects my opinion of Priyanka Chopra's acting. Jiya got to be annoying in spots. But a part of it is that Priyanka's effort here really is less than scintillating. There's even one point where I thought her character was turning into an outright villainness, before she redeems herself. Priyanka does save her best acting for the finale.

ANDAAZ is a heartwrenching, tearjerker of a film and, in the watching of it, threatened to drown me in romantic depression. But it kept me involved enough, even thru the cliches, that I wanted to see how it would all turn out, and, believe me, I wasn't sure who Raj would end up with. Being a Bollywood feature, ANDAAZ also comes complete with song numbers, the two most powerful being the wedding number ""Kisise Tum Pyar Karo"" and also ""Rabba Ishq Na Hove,"" which explores the triangle of Raj, Jiya, and Kaajal. The most fun song, though, is ""Shalala Baby."" If you get nothing else out of this film, at least, consider once again its underlying message: ""If you love someone, express it."" You wouldn't want to go thru what Raj did. That would suck.",1179964800,6,3377,4.699324324324325
