7945853,3,B00005MM7S,"This movie came with a pack of other movies in a boxset called Return Of the Warriors.  The quailty of the video is crap, but what do you expect from a box-set that includes 20 classic martial arts movies ( did i mention that it is dub only) for only 26 bucks.
36 crazy fists is just another variations of Jacky Chan's Movies, such as Drunken Master ( Noter: Legend of the Drunken Master is english re-release of Drunken Master II),  and Snake in Eagle's Shadow (These two movies also have a similar old drunken man that that teaches kung-fu to a pathetic newbie).  It just that Jacky Chan is not acting, but the fight choreographer (This is obivious if you watched the movies I mentioned earlier.)
Any kung-fu buff will love 36 crazy fist's martial arts action. Each move is done flawlessly and without losing a beat ( you will never see pure martial arts technique's like these in Jackie's new movies.)  The storyline is a backdrop for what the show really is; a martial arts flick, and does not take it's self seriously which make for a lot of good humor.  However the dub is horrendous, as a lot of martial arts dubs are.  The dub makes the part's where there is no fighting a chore to watch.  But the most dissapointing aspect is that it was chopped down to only the actual fights it self. All but a small few of the training sessions made it to the final cut.  The training portions of Drunken Master and Snake in Eagle's Shadow where fun to watch and gave more depth to the fights because you see Jacky use the weird techniques learned in training in a actual fight.
Bottom line:  Great kung-fu movie, but watch it subbed for a better veiwing experience.",1085875200,3,1661,4.4375
