7988627,5,B000092WAL,"Saw this some years ago when it first aired, and was quite fascinated by the meticulous presentation.  .  .but only taped the the last hour--hoping for one day to have the entire program.
Now, I finally do--and it is still as Awesome as it was then.  Although many more suspects have emerged since this first was made,  still this manages to hold up as to profiling the yet present candidates that haven't faded from the foremost likely suspects!  Thanks for this wonderful program finally being on DVD!  !  !

7988630,5,B000092WAL,"I actually set my VCR back in 1988 to record this program on VHS tape while I was out of state on a job assignment for later viewing. I felt and still feel this documentary does justice to it's subject matter. I was very happy to find that it is available on DVD (PAL) and bought it. The entire program runs fine on my universal DVD player. Would highly recommend this DVD especially for those who like documentaries and/or ""who dunnits.""",1354147200,2,438,4.419753086419753
7988631,1,B000092WAL,"I received the DVD entitled 'Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper', with a notice that it had been cleaned & tested.
The first two-third of the DVD played fine, but the last third kept stopping and skipping to the extent that
most of this part was unwatchable.  However, since I was mainly interested in the first half of the DVD I am
keeping it as is.",1230508800,2,350,4.303030303030303
