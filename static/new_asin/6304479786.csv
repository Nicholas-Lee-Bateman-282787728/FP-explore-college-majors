896243,4,6304479786,"This picture is a great improvement over the movies of the previous three years (especially when compared to EASY COME, EASY GO and CLAMBAKE).
In this more adult-oriented comedy, Elvis plays a photographer who gets  stalked by a rather eccentric woman, who gets him fired from his job and  moves him out of his own home. How does she do it? I can't tell you, you  have to buy the picture. He, he.
Anyway, you'll have fun watching Elvis  juggle between two jobs, and the songs in this picture are actually GOOD  (especially ""Edge of Reality"" and ""A Little Less  Conversation""). The ""Edge of Reality"" sequence is actually  pretty psychedelic, an Elvis film highlight, indeed.
Finally, Elvis was  getting more quality scripts in this period. Unfortunately, his movie  contract was almost up, so that's probably the reason for it.
Buy this  picture, you'll be glad you did.",960768000,4,869,4.850340136054422

The plot of the schizophrenic woman that picks him up and take him on a wild mind game would take anyone to 'The Edge of Reality' The song is a masterpiece from the words to the dancing and the costumes...all pure 60's. The rushing about from one photo shoot to the other was fun to watch, not sloppy and boring like most of his movies. 'A Little Less Conversation'is a terrific song real sharp and sexy, but to me he should of sung it to the Amazon he met at the party and took away for a little Rumpy-Pumpy. How times have changed with woman's figures- not a skinny looking one amongst them.

896541,3,6304479786,"Elvis is ultra-hip in this, one of the last of his long list of mondo-60's cheesy celluloid musical romps. This film makes an attempt to be a departure from the more family-oriented technicolor Elvis movies of the mid and early 60s and tries to offer up a more adult story line. The King is a swinging freelance photographer cruising the streets of L.A., in his dune buggy,  from downtown to the beaches of Malibu in search of subjects for his camera. This Elvis character is an avowed bachelor and ladies man (as are most of Elvis's characters) who freely and openly drinks, says ""damn"" and ""hell"" several times throughout the movie, does photo shoots of nude girls for men's magazines and is a devotee of the free love movement. He is forced, against his will, to shack up in a Malibu beach house with his leading lady and her enormous Great Dane Albert, after she drugs him with hallucinogens of some type (the insinuation is that it's LSD, as he goes on a colorful mindtrip resembling a bad fever dream)and he goes into a three day coma that results in him losing his job at the local newspaper. The rest of the movie centers around him trying to get his life back together as he manages to hoodwink two magazine publishers into hiring him as their exclusive in house photographer and tries to get away from the creepy girl and her big dog, as she continually insinuates herself back into his life. As crazy as it all sounds and as incongrouros and cheesy as it really is, there's something extremely cool about Elvis in this movie. It just goes to prove that Elvis was so cool, you could have stood him on a pile of horse dung and he would still look cool. The highlight of the movie is the pool party scene in which the King offers up his original performance of the now-popular ""A Little Less Conversation"" immortalized with the charttopping remix a few years back and in ""Oceans 11"".",1185753600,5,1891,4.529239766081871
896542,5,6304479786,"This movie has it all -- Michelle Carey, Elvis, changing times, psychedelic sequences (check out the ""Edge of Reality"" bit -- the girls ""morph"" *years* before the technology was invented!), taboo subjects (sex, etc.), and the original version of ""A Little Less Conversation."" It is a true romantic comedy; had it never been made with Elvis, and had been shot this year with Ben Afleck and Cameraon Diaz, it would be a smash hit! Actually, it was a pretty big hit in its own time, even though it was one of Elvis's last three or four movies. This film needs to be released on DVD soon! Especially wonderful is the widescreen version that airs on TNT every now and then. Michelle Carey was incredible -- I wish she was still around. The songs are great (all 4 of them), and this movie, written by the same dude that wrote ""Private Lessons"" (1981), rises above the rest of the awful schlock that Elvis concerned himself with for the majority of the sixties. Relax, check it out, and have a good time.",1120521600,10,997,4.544444444444444
896543,5,6304479786,"This film is very in tune with the 1960's and even has an acid-influenced Elvis-dream sequence!  Elvis is very relaxed in the role and seems to actually enjoy it.  He gets to be a cool photographer with a cool dune buggy and a great big dog for a pet.  This is fast-paced, not slow, like some other reviewers have said...Elvis fans will be surprisingly pleased by this very-late-stage film.  I think he made only 1 or 2 others after this one.  I bought it for the psychedelic acid-dream sequence and ended up really enjoying the whole movie and I'm wasn't even a hardcore Elvis fan.  (But now I am!)",1116028800,8,599,4.4495412844036695

896545,4,6304479786,"""Live A Little, Love A Little"" is as close to '60s themed as it can get. This picture finds Elvis juggling between two magzine photographer jobs, and it looks sort of compliacted. He takes his leisure time out especially later for girls and Michele Cary. This film is a little cautionary to younger viewers. ""Live A Little, Love A Little"" focuses more on sex and tries to keep up with the ever-changing times. ""Live A Little, Love A Little"" features the low ""Edge Of Reality"" sequence which is very psychadelic in a sense, and ""A Little Less Conversation"" which became a hit this summer. By the way, pick up ""ELV1S 30 #1 Hits"", too. Suprising, this film can be enjoyable in some ways.",1037059200,6,684,4.569105691056911
896546,5,6304479786,"This film is not only weird, but mad cool.  The direction of the film, by Norman Taurog, is great.  Don't believe me?  Watch the fight in the newspaper plant.  Jackie Chan has used the SAME gags in his film, and this was 1968, when Jackie was still at opera school.  It is short, but very well done for an old fight scene.
Then, there is the EVER SHY GORGEOUS Michele Carey.  My oh My, this girl is sooooooooo beautiful in this film, and her voice is to die for.  (she does not sing, i am talking her speaking voice here!)
The party scene, where they use the song popular again today, A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION, has great panning Hero shots of Elvis, in a mod blue suit, strutting though a party, hunting and catching his prey, a blonde bombshell.  This vignette, is awesome, and worth watching the film alone.
Finally, there is the TRUTH.  Can't tell you more, cause it would ruin the film.
Lots of hot chicks, weird cool 60's dialogue, parties, and events, and Elvis being the coolest mofo on the planet.

896548,5,6304479786,"I've been an Elvis fan for 10 years now, and I've seen most of his 60's movies. For some reason I didn't rent this one till recently- I think it's because I had it confused with ""The Trouble With Girls"", which I have no desire to see. Anyway, we rented this because we saw it had ""A Little Less Conversation"" in it and liked it so much we ended up buying it.
 Elvis plays Greg Nolan, a photographer who..ok, there's not much of a plot to describe here. The storyline consists of a girl he meets who keeps changing her name (Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice) and personality, spending most of the movie alternately messing with Elvis' mind and coming on to him. Meanwhile, Elvis gets two jobs for girlie-type magazines in the same building- one of them is called ""Classic Cat Magazine"" (or maybe it's Classy Cat) being a photographer and pretends at both that he only works for that magazine, while he literally runs back and forth between the two jobs, changing clothes and trying not to have one boss find out about the other. Red West makes his usual cameo as a guy in a fight scene who Elvis ends up [fighting] (always fun to watch).
 This is a pretty fun Elvis movie, and since it was filmed in '68, right around the time Elvis did the comeback special, the King was in great shape, looking pretty sharp with his sideburns and tan. He also looks like he's having fun, and doesn't feel too stupid. ""Spinout"" is entertaining, but half the time Elvis looks pretty unhappy. One of my Elvis trivia-type books said this movie has the distinction of being the only one he ever has sex in (offscreen, of course) but I think the only way you could tell this is by him waking up in a girl's bed. His co-star, who looks like a cross between Sharon Tate and how Liz Taylor looked in the 60's, was kind of annoying (though not as bad as some of the actresses he's worked with, and at least she has a great wardrobe.) It was mainly the fact that she had this kind of whispery voice like Taylor. The clothes and hair are all really cool.
There are only 4 songs in the movie, but two of them are especially good. I loved ""The Edge of Reality""-Elvis has this trippy dream because Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice has been messing with his mind so much. The song is great, and Elvis wears this tailored set of pajamas that look more like a blue sharkskin suit. I think whoever designed and choreographed the dream sequence might have paid a little visit to Dr. Nick's, if you know what I mean, but it's pretty cool. The highlight of the movie for me was definitely ""A Little Less Conversation"", which Elvis sings to a hot babe at a swinging cocktail party as he's getting her to leave with him. Watch for the male red-haired go-go dancer that they pass who dances so furiously and wildly that his gyrations actually make him upstage Elvis for a few seconds, which is no small feat. As he and the chick are leaving, they pass other go-go dancers, saunter out the door of the cool 60's pad, and hop in Elvis' Cadillac that the valets just happened to have pulled up in front at that second, while Elvis smoothly never misses a beat and manages to make the whole thing look like he does it every night. Now THAT'S how you leave a party!
 One of Elvis' better flicks from the 60's, and definitely my favorite movie of his to watch from the late 60's.",976060800,18,3318,4.4183006535947715
896549,3,6304479786,"It's possible that Director Norman Taurog finally realized that it was Elvis in '68, not Crosby in '38, and gave him a chance to mature his on-screen personae: here Elvis gets entangled with a bohemian babe and  handles simultaneous photography assignments, one in the ""adult""  category.

7873819,3,6304479786,"I don't know that this is Elvis' worst movie - because Stay Away, Joe was pretty crappy - but, to me, Live a Little, Love a Little ranks as bottom-of-the-barrel cinema. It coincides with the studio's latest attempt to revamp Elvis' onscreen image from that of the squeaky-clean boyish crooner to the more mature leading man, seeing as how the 1960s was a swinging era in which inhibition was out the window and Elvis movies steadily regarded as unhip and anachronistic. To demonstrate that the King was as with it as the next cool cat, his character here is shown in bed with a woman (all signs indicating that he'd been intimate with her), his songs were cut down to four and made edgier, and he even undergoes a psychedelic freak-out dream sequence.

Poor Greg Nolan (Presley), shutterbug for the Hollywood Citizen-News, who did nothin' to deserve that crazy chick's advances. This movie is jarring from jump as we observe a carefree Greg in his yellow dune buggy hurtling his way down a beach in Malibu as the opening credits roll and a forgettable Elvis tune serenades us. It's Greg's misfortune that his dune buggy brakes within eyeballing distance of an artist's (Michele Carey) beach house. The artist's name is Alice or Susie or Betty or Bernice, depending on her mood and whom she's with. Alice or Susie or Betty or Bernice is a screwy dame.

In quick succession, she propositions Greg, sics her Great Dane on him, slips him a mickey that puts him to sleep for days, and loses him his job and his apartment. And while, in screwball comedies, such wanton mayhem and unpredictability would make someone like Katharine Hepburn or Paula Prentiss seem that much more endearing, this movie efs up by being aggravatingly nebulous as to Michele Carey's motivation. We do eventually find out what makes her tick, but it's not until very late in the plot, and, by that point, who cares? Elvis spends most of the movie in a foul mood, and I can't blame him. His bad temper seems to have carried over to his obligatory, more-violent-than-usual fight scene. And maybe I blinked because I sure missed that moment when he fell in love with the ditzy dame. When did that happen? That came out of nowhere.

I couldn't care less about the love story. I was more into Elvis' sleight-of-hand as he simultaneously moonlights as a full-time photographer for a conservative publisher (Rudy Vallee) AND a jolly purveyor (Don Porter) of girly magazines. See Elvis engage in physical slapstick as he repeatedly dashes up and down the stairs, swapping a somber business suit for one gig for a more relaxed wardrobe for the other. Luckily, his two jobs are in the same building, only a few floors removed. Else, he'd have required longer smoke breaks.

It's a movie based on Dan Greenburg's 1965 novel, Kiss My Firm But Pliant Lips, except you don't care about that, nor do I. More interesting to trivia-heads is that this ended up being prolific director Norman Taurog's final movie as he would go blind shortly after. He ended up directing nine Elvis flicks. He could've gone out on a better note. To me, this movie's saving grace is the funky ""A Little Less Conversation,"" Elvis' persuasive come-on song sung to blonde bombshell Celeste Yarnall during a decadent Playboy mansion-type soire. It's the one salvagable jam in the soundtrack. Of course, if you're down with pseudo-acid rock, then maybe ""Edge of Reality"" is more up your alley. Live a Little, Love a Little is one perplexing movie. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",1468886400,,3496,4.764026402640264
