Movie Review: This is my all-time favorite slasher movie. It's incoherent, poorly acted, cheesy and so forth but it's intentional as well as it's unintentional humor along with the violence, the great serial killer story and all sorts of wacky **** makes this perfect horror movie. I love it.

1015708,5,6305385033,"Otherwise known as A Thousand Screams in the Night, Pieces is an unabashed splatter flick from the glorious unrestrained 80s.  Best example of justifiable homicide and child abuse in the opening salvo.  ""Hurry up stupid and bring me a bag!""  Good hack work is so hard to come by these days, requiring that we search out old forgotten gems like this.  Of course, as the story goes, 40 years later the killer kid has switched from an ax to a chainsaw.  Now he's on a campus with a bevy of beauties to choose from, where to begin.  Clothed, not clothed, it hardly matters; a chainsaw will cut through anything, and does with alarming frequency.  There are plenty of suspects starting with the obviously creepy groundskeeper (Paul Smith), an overly fussy professor, and an all too helpful student (Ian Sera).  The killer is only shown in silhouette, sporting a hat, and wearing some nifty shoes.  Heavy breathing accompanies his rabid staring at possible victims.  The cop in charge of the case, Lt. Bracken (a jovial Christopher George) is more than willing to encourage one of the suspects (Ian Sera as Kendall James), to help them snoop and to act as a body guard for the tennis instructor Mary (Linda Day).  Yeah, that didn't make any sense to me either.  Maybe Spain has a different way of solving crimes.

The dubbing holds some problems as do a few scenes that don't make any sense (particularly the skateboarder and a large mirror).  The cuts between scenes are a bit abrupt.  The acting styles don't entirely mesh (apparently, people were speaking in their own language(s) to one another to be later dubbed in English).  Linda Day's performance was particularly unrestrained (""Bastard, bastard, bastard!"").
But there's definitely no competition for the most bizarre ending of any slasher flick.

Love this movie, warts and all.",1410480000,2,1832,4.877022653721683

Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at just how bad this film was. It was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other.

The film attempts to tell the story of a dark, psychopathic killer, one in which a slasher type of character heads off to splatter damsels in distress.

In reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own jaded philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh).

The movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. What's even worse though is the editing of this film. The film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row.

I think that this was an attempt to emulate films like 'My Bloody Valentine' slasher sequences, but it fails utterly. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene).

1015794,3,6305385033,"I first watched this film years ago when VHS tapes were still available to buy at cheap price
i was a big fan of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE film at the time
when i bought this PIECES film out of curiosity reasons really, years ago.
PIECES was fist released on VHS around 1981-82
it was hard for me to watch the whole film every kill was extremely Graphic as Hell
more Graphic than other slasher films released the same year
and the plot/screenplay was so ridiculous that there's not much of a plot at all
and the Acting is terrible so the film is Just a Gore fest of kills really piece of Garbage

the first scene was very disturbing/shocking of a young kid chopping up his mother for some reason
and many scenes like that through the whole film, kills by chainsaw chopping up young students.
i prefer to watch TCM than this film
TCM is a Psychological thriller with some Horrific scenes in it but has a Great script
this film PIECES is not, nowhere close to it

and then i find out that this film gets a DVD release by Grindhouse releasing
with all new special features including an interview with the Director of the film
so i decided to buy it just to watch the interviews out of curiosity that's the only reason i bought it
so watching a new HD transfer of the film was just a bonus in my opinion.
there is only couple interviews one interview is with Director Juan Piquer
very long interview, very in depth, goes for about 90mins
the Director is spanish i did not know that, but the film is in English
the interview has English subtitles
the Director talks about the making of the film, talks about the Actors/actresses
talks about shooting the film/the locations, he talks about releasing the film UNRATED
and he talks about other stuff aswell
very informative interview.
the 2nd interview is with Paul smith one of the Actors.

the picture and audio quality is excellent in Widescreen format better than VHS quality anyway.
the film is very much UNCUT there's extra gore footage that's not seen in the VHS release

this film is specifically for fans who love Gore films that have very ridiculous/pathetic plots
so PIECES is definitely a unique taste in film where there is more Gore than a storyline.

i gave this film 3 stars meaning the film is OK cause the plot/Acting is terrible, it's a Gore fest
 mainly cause i don't mind watching it occasionally, probably once a year
but the special features are excellent, the Directors interview is very interesting.

so if you love this film than fine, you obviously love the Gore scenes/the kills
than this Grindhouse Deluxe edition release of PIECES is the one to get.",1379894400,,2623,4.556263269639066
1015888,5,6305385033,"By all means Pieces is an awful and terrible movie, but it is so bad and so poorly written, shot, and acted that it is an absolute joy watching this monstrosity on TV. If you love goofy bad horror movies then Pieces is the Godfather of them all.",1379808000,,245,4.125
1015889,4,6305385033,"Pieces is a film about a killer who murdered his own mother and has started up again at a college campus. Pieces is absolutely delightful because it is one of the best bad movies I have ever seen. It scared me when I was eight and I love to laugh at it now. It is hard to take seriously but is definitely a minor horror gem. The acting is wonderfully cheesy. I have seen the film countless times. This is considered the best release because the uncut version (dubbed in English), the original Spanish version (with a different soundtrack) and an uncut theatrical release Vinehouse Theatre (with audio audience reactions) are included. There are some extras (including an interview with the legendary Paul Smith). It's not for everyone but if you love horror-comedy this might be for you.

*SPOILERS* Special Features:
Great, creepy ""music box"" score usually accompanied by the killer breathing heavily.
Plenty of over-the-top gore.
An Italian location dressed up to look like a campus in Boston, USA.
Wardrobe without equal for the 1980s.
Incredibly amusing dialogue and delivery.
The longest product shot I can remember on film. Wendy's Hamburgers got millions in free advertising.
The best twist ending since Carrie. It still gives me the creeps.

*SPOILERS* The Cast:
Our hero has women who want to get tied up by him. He ends up playing junior investigator with the police. ""You'd think you were in bed with Chainsaw Charlie.""
An annoying nerd with some awfully bad lines. ""I'm too young to die.""
A tennis pro champion who works undercover for the police (but can't play tennis, fire a gun or act). ""Bastard!""
The university dean who looks and acts like Mr. Bean. ""The professor is a homosexual who almost tried to kill me.""
Seemingly pointless professor who gets picked up by students. ""I can assure you they are fine,"" (after pointing to his breasts).
Two bumbling police officers common to the era. ""We're trying on clothes with no labels and seeing what fits.""
A martial arts instructor who shows his stuff. ""Must have been bad chop suey.""
Possibly the best part is cult actor Paul Smith appearing as the gardener.",1377561600,,2122,4.8429752066115705

This movie in no way can rival The TX Chainsaw Massacre or any other well made horror movie but if you enjoy movies with bad acting, although Christopher George gives some credibility, questionable plot (Why did the killer, after all these years suddenly miss his mom and decide to try to recreate her????) and gratuitous nudity, then grab a cold drink, turn off the lights and enjoy this one. I have to say that this genre of horror movie is a love it/hate it sort of thing but we're not talking Silence Of The Lambs here.

2.  The fact that this is supposed to be Boston but is so obviously made in Spain.
3. The bad dubbing.
4. The line about ""The most beautiful thing in the world...""
5. The looks the creepy handyman has on his face ALL THE TIME.
6.  The fact that at this school two people can get it on in broad daylight right on the lawn and no one cares.  Conversely, people can be chainsawed up right there and no one will take any notice.
7. The tiny elevator chainsaw scene.
8. The long, pointless scene where the dancer walks to ""The john"".
9. The hilariously racist Kung Fu scene.
10. ""BASTARRRRD!  BAAAAASTARRRRRRD!  BASTAAAAAAARRRRRD!""
11. The zombie attack at the end.

1016019,5,6305385033,"PIECES has a sleazy trashy type feel that isn't present in most slashers at the time; It's much sleazier than the stuff like THE BURNING, FINAL EXAM, the FRIDAY THE 13TH films, and other 80s slashers like that.  Some of the script could have been better because some of the dialogue and plot needs an improvement, and the bad dubbing may annoy mainstream horror fans.  However, it isn't a film that is meant to be critically analyzed. It begins quickly with graphic gore, but it does have a tendency to slow up a bit later on; however, most of the film moves at a decent pace. It does have a chainsaw killer, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all fans of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE will enjoy this film; this is much sleazier and gorier, and it also lacks the suspense, character development, atmosphere, and scenery of that film. There's full nudity in this film, and the body count is pretty good; and even though they didn't have FX artists like Tom Savini, the low budget gore is convincing and effective. The gore here is sometimes very graphic, as well as being quite impactful. It also should be noted that despite having college kids being butchered all around campus, this is all supposed to be a secret to virtually everyone in the entire state.  The script is indeed awful in some parts, but it's fun. The entire film has a dark tone, so it's recommended for those who like serious horror movies.  I know some people may criticize the absurd ending, but I think it's perfect for such an absurd film, and it also left the door open for what could've been a great sequel. I also thought it was very well scored and this certainly helps it.

As many horror fans already know, Juan Piquer Simon died in 2011 from cancer.  He also directed two other films that I really like.  One is called SLUGS and the other is CTHULHU MANSION.  THE CTHULHU MANSION seems to have fallen into obscurity.  I personally really liked that one and it needs a DVD release.  I know some people won't like, it but I think it's a underrated film of his that doesn't get enough credit.  As for this DVD set,  It's a superb package with excellent bonus features and the film looks great. The best extra is where you get to watch the film with an audio track playing that lets you hear the reactions of an audience that was watching a theater screening of the film. There's also an option to watch another audio version of the film with some different music. The soundtracks in this version aren't as good, and I think watching it this way damages the films intensity; but some may actually like it more, so it gives the viewer another option on how to watch it which is good. The DVD menu screens are also well done, and you get an interview with the director.",1323734400,2,2747,4.482965931863728

I learned of it through the same channels I learned about other classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead, around the lunchroom table at school! Kids love to brag about how many ""R"" films they've got to see in their young lifetime. Particuarly ones requiring a barf bag for viewing. One kid had told us of this spanish import with the infamous ""ball ripping"" scene. I did not quite believe that he really saw it since alot of kids toss stories around when in the company of their peers, I figured he had an older sibling that saw the flick and got his info from him. But alas, I shouldn't cast stones since as a kid I told a few questionable tales myself (yeah, that's the ticket!). I was 19 when I finally got the nerve to rent it on VHS. While it was gorey with a capital ""G"", the picture and sound quality was crap, thus being very unwatchable. I never gave Pieces another thought until I saw a copy of the Grindhouse DVD. So, I shelled out a few bones, refrained from eating, and popped the disc in the player. Low and behold, here was the film my school chum was braggin about in all it blood drenched glory! This is 80's slasher horror at it's best, with a little Herschal Gordon Lewis camp thrown in. I suggest watching this with the spanish audio version to really appreciate the original score, far superior to the stock music in the english dubb. The easter egg of Eli Roth of Hostel fame giving praise with a couple of other b-movie notables is a nice suprise too! The extras inlcude lengthy interviews with the director Juan Piquer and veteran actor Paul Smith (Bluto from the 1980 Popeye movie) still galleries of poster art, vhs,dvd covers, ect. This is definetly something every horror fan should check out, but approach with the intention of having fun for this is not a sophisicated horror film like Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist, but to sit with your friends and have few laughs!

Well, for THIS (at the time) twelve year old, that was like the old ""drag the carrot on a string for Bugs Bunny"" trick:  I KNEW I HAD to see this one...I mean, the R-rated movies would let you in with your folks, but this one said ""sorry kid, I don't care if your old man IS buying the ticket, you CAN'T see this""...but thanks to video rentals in the next couple of years, I WAS able to watch this what in MY mind was the Everest of horror movies.

Now, anyone perusing this movie or reading this review should likely understand that if the film's title is ""Pieces"", you really shouldn't expect master thespians nor outstanding cinematography nor pretty much anything ELSE in the level of technical or professional greatness.

However, for horror fim fans, there's a gold mine.  You want blood?  You got it.  Dismemberment?  Yeah, we got that too. Gratuitous nudity?  Well of COURSE. Twisted (if somewhat predictable) plot?  You betcha.  From the opening sequence to the shocking (and almost physically painful) ending, you are grabbed and held...enough so to make you overlook the transparent story and largely pedestrian acting.  The movie drags a bit in places, but never long enough for you to really fall out of the mindset.

And as all of us horror-philes know, bad acting is and of itself something to cherish...there's one line spoken by the second-banana police detective (Not the lovely Lynda Day, but the other, male detective...although Miss Day has a doozy of her own) that my friends and I STILL use to this day that was so over-the-top, so over-acted, that it continues to get a chuckle every time we hear it. I won't spoil it, but I'm willing to bet you'll know it when you hear it.

I'm not even going to get into the absolutely pointless but equally hilarious scene with the Asian professor...that you should experience for yourself.

I definitely recommend any horror, slasher, or exploitation flick fans to add this one to their collection...

...ah, but you'll only be admitted if you're over seventeen:)",1284249600,2,2282,4.79539641943734
1016027,4,6305385033,"I had a lot of fun with ""Pieces.""  It is one of those trashy low budget slasher films in the tradition of ""Graduation Day"" and ""Slumber Party Massacre"" that borders on self parody and always makes for an enjoyable viewing.

Initially released in 1982 under its original Spanish title ""Mil Gritos Tiene La Noche"" (roughly translated as ""Night Has a Thousand Screams""), the film was picked up by Spectacular International Productions (which would go on to market such transcontinental bloodletters as ""Don't Open till Christmas"" and ""Slaughter High"") in 1983 for its dubbed version and under its new and more appropriate title ""Pieces.""

The plot concerns an unknown loony cutting up assorted young babes on a Boston (actually Madrid) college campus, as a result of an earlier traumatic childhood experience, in which his mother reprimanded him for having a nudie jigsaw puzzle, for which he proceeded to chop her to bits in the film's classic prologue.  Fast forward 40 years later, and he is slowly reassembling the same bloodstained puzzle with each gruesome present-day murder.

Under the hands of a more straightforward script, this could have been a really mean and unsavory film, but co-writer and co-producer Dick Randall and Spanish director J. Piquer Simon enliven this one with so much tacky sleaze and are so singleminded in their approach to showing really attractive (and often fully unclothed) Spanish girls being butchered that you just can't take any of it seriously.  The questionable dubbing and some really hammy overacting even generate the occasional laugh.

That said, what must have been a miniscule budget produced some really good gore, such as when the killer's chainsaw is actually shown slicing flesh.  In addition, this is a true splatter film in every sense of the word and the blood flows ever freely, even being splattered all over the walls in several scenes.

Another plus is the presence of some real actors, such as Christopher George and Edmund Purdom (neither one a stranger to low budget films of this era) and my personal favorite, the then 37-year-old (but still very comely) Linda Day (eventually George), who sparkles as a tennis star who goes undercover to investigate the killings.

This 2008 reissue on Grindhouse Releasing is choice.  It includes reproductions of the original Spanish and English movie posters, an amusing retrospective on the film written by ""Deep Red"" editor Chas Balun, and even a bonus disc featuring a translated interview with the director.

All in all, while almost laughably inept at times and never serious enough to generate true suspense, ""Pieces"" is still a beloved slasher gem and a really fun movie to watch.  Recommended for collectors of vintage early '80s trash cinema.

(Final sidenote:  One of the detectives and a student working on the case are shown eating fast food which is clearly shown to be from Wendy's Hamburgers.  I wonder how Wendy's corporate executives would feel knowing they had a product endorsement in ""Pieces"" of all movies?  Somehow I have a feeling it was never a selling point at business conferences.)",1281225600,2,3106,5.082677165354331
1016028,4,6305385033,"A young boy, seated on the floor of his bedroom, is happily engaged in assembling a cardboard picture puzzle while reciting the old nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty. His mother then enters the room, undetected by the lad, approaches him from behind and peers down at the nearly completed picture puzzle, .. . to find, to her utmost and intense appallment and horror, that it's pictured subject is a thoroughly nude, very voluptuously formed and enticingly posed woman!!!  Moved to great indignation and furry by the discovery, she then announces her presence to the surprised and frightened youngster by fiercely exclaiming ""Where did this filth come from ?!!!!"", then kicks the puzzle, thus shattering it back into pieces, slaps the youngsters face, scolds him verbally for being a ""Dirty minded brat!!!!"" and, in a raging fury, grabs a framed picture and violently swings it into a mirror, thus smashing it, for extra measure!  She then turns back toward the now terrified youngster, glares fiercely at him, and declares ""I'm going to put a stop to THIS once and for all!!! Go get a bag!!!!"".  Then, seemingly complying with the harsh command, the lad then departs the room! The youngster now absent, the indignant mother then searches the room frantically for any further items of ""smut"" which the lad may have stashed away!  A moment later, while mother is squatted down sifting through a toybox, she senses the lads reentry and looks up at him about to lash him some more, . .. yet to find him standing closely above her  with a large axe held in his grasp and raised high above his head like mighty Paul Bunyan!!  No sooner does she issue forth a shrill shriek than does he swing the axe downward, sending it's heavy bladed head crashing upon her skull!!.. . twice in quick succesion!!!  He then sawes her body apart while grinning malevolently!!  Later, two police officers, alerted by an alarmed neighbor, barge into the house!  They find the room spatterd with blood, the womans body dismembered and the fiendish little tyke tucked in a closet, feigning trauma and muttering ""Big man!! .. MOMY!!!  Wheres my momy ?!!!""
Forty years later the little fiend is all grown up and the respected and somewhat stuffy dean of a prestigious university. The kind where the students pass notes to each other which read ""I want to do it with you underwater!"" and engage in casual hallway chit chat like ""The most beautiful thing in the world is smoking pot and %#@$!*& on a waterbed!!"".  However, he STILL has one slight peculiar little quirk retained from his boyhood which he prefers to keep secret from his fellow faculty and student body, yet is compelled to pursue, .. he STILL has a thing for picture puzzles of a feminine subject and distinctly voluptuous nature!  Indeed, he's even in the process of assembling just such a puzzle currently. However THIS one is life-sized, three dimensional and not made of cardboard!!  And with a large campus populated and bustling with numerous nubile young female students, he has at his convenience a vast garden, extensive and assorted, from which to pluck the pieces ( hence the title ) for his gruesome masterpiece!!  Thus he pursues this latent hobby during his spare time!  Surreptitiously stalking the campus while inconspicuously clothed in a huge black hat and heavy black coat with a big noisy chainsaw as his usual choice of weapon ( though he does also use a butcher knife in one instance ) stealthily concealed behind his back!  Capturing his sized-up and selected female victim, the lucky lady so to speak, in solitude ( hallways, gymnasiums, locker rooms, elevators, the campus lawn in broad daylight ) he then whips out his chainsaw and .. WWWHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRR .. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! .. SSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAASSSSHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! ,.. and then claims the coveted piece of anatomy!!  Then, utterly leaving a gory mess at the departed scene ( sure, let it be somebody else's headache ) and towing along a large clumpy blood-soaked cloth sack dragged slug-like on the floor while panting very heavily and repeatedly along the way, he retreats to his live-in den in the bowels of which he conceals his gruesome masterwork, to which he then contributes the freshly acquired part, with the old miniature cardboard puzzle which started him on the whole kick ( still retained in his possession and now stained with bloody fingerprints ) being used to mark his progress with the MAIN puzzle!! Each killing being immediately followed by brief shots of a portion of it being assembled ( a decapitation is followed by a close-up of the pictured subjects head being pieced together.  A victims arm being slashed off is similarly climaxed by the same subjects arms being added.  A girl is sawed in half and the subjects torso is added, .. . and so on, you get the picture, pun intended ).
A police investigation naturally ensues.  However, despite the killers very slothingly methods ( which have been described previously ), authorities on the case are none the less completely stumped!!  So desperately perplexed are they that they're even compelled to involve as a collaborator a certain male student ( the supposed ""campus stud"" as he's familiar with all the female students ) and an attractive female tennis player as a hopeful decoy!

Now this movie came out in the aftermath of the early 80's ""slasher"" explosion when practically every film of that genre wanted to be a Halloween or Friday The 13th imitation. Some fools might even want to compare it to Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the mere obvious fact that it features a chainsaw as a murder weapon. However, this film is actually much more reminiscent of the old gore films of Hershel Gordon Lewis, inparticularly Blood Feast, and not so much in it's depicted gore ( which is MUCH better done in this film ) but rather in it's campily sick & tasteless script.  Lines like ""Such a terrible thing, this killing!  The police still haven't any idea what the killer wanted with the head!!"" .. or .. ""So I don't think you sawed up Susan!! .. . but where the hell were you for @#%!$* sake ?!!"" .. ""Well you know Julie, that blonde in anthropology ?"" .. ""You made her too ?!!"" .. ""Yeah!"" .. ""Wow Kendal, how do you do it ?!!"" are certainly reminiscent of the ridiculous dialogue in Blood Feast ( though with more sexual references and profanity ).  So strong, in fact, is the H.G.L. influence in this movie that I suspect that it's even an express tribute to the old ""Godfather of Gore"".  Of course the acting is horendous by pretty much all involved,.. yet most especialy by Christopher George who seems to have only one delivery which remains constant no matter what!  He sayes lines like ""That poor girl was cut in half for God's sake!!  Can you imagine the terror she went through ?!!"" and ""You'll be playing tennis.  You'll be playing SO MUCH tennis it'll be comming out'a your ears!!"" in the exact same tone!
Yet the bad performances, campy script and utter tastelesness not withstanding, Pieces DOES manage to succeed as a truly powerful, effective and classic shock horror film with all the qualities to make for such, and for which it should be duly noted and praised!  Firstly and above all, as evident from the preceding plot description, Pieces certainly does feature a certain sick conceptual inventiveness and originality ( with the human jigsaw puzzle idea ) and THAT is certainly something to be noted and admired in ANY movie ( however sick, tasteless and trashy ) and also something quite rare and uncommon ( especially in an 80's slasher flick ).
Pieces also DOES feature some truly powerful shocks and scares which are often, and quite surprisingly, well done ( cleverly conceived, brilliantly executed, genuinely horrifying and with very good effects work for such a small modestly budgeted film ).  The murder scenes really ARE shocking and quite horrifying, particularly a scene in which a victim is stabbed repeatedly on a waterbed.  And the scene in which the human jigsaw puzzle is revealed is very cleverly done, completely surprising and scary.
Also worth noting is a certain percievable crude humor and sexual innuendo in the killing scenes.  How the trenchcoated killer suddenly whips out his wwwwhhhhhiiiirrrring chainsaw, which resembles a huge phallus, and the female victim recoiling, grimacing and shrieking in reaction.
And something to be said about the campiness of this film,.. it actually has the effect of rendering the horrifing scenes that much more shocking and powerful when they occur!.. . to almost dissarm one, and I have no doubt that THAT was something calculated on the part of the films makers.  It seems to be a kind of intentional DECEPTIVE campiness under which a very sly and elusive creative brilliance is at work and designed to put one off their guard so to speak.
In short, I believe that Pieces is that rare case of an intentionally and deceptively ""bad"" film made by clever and talented filmmakers,.. with genuine potential to become a true bona-fide midnight cult classic right along with the likes of Reefer Madness, Pink Flamingos, Rocky Horror, Basket Case and THAT entire lot!  Hopefully it shall one day attain that very status.",1280188800,6,9223,4.8941629249518925
1016108,5,6305385033,Pieces is about a psycho path that makes a jigsaw puzzle piece by piece out of victims he kills by taking each part from every victim until the puzzle is complete.........classic horror,1272240000,,185,4.8125
1016109,5,6305385033,"Pieces is a movie you just have to love. On the surface, it looks like a laughably bad horror film relying on fairly graphic blood-letting for its appeal, a movie which gives us absolutely no character we can possibly like, not even the bad guy, and a film whose killer is easily identifiable early on. It is all of these things. Then you get to the ending, and suddenly the ghastly ordeal of sitting through ninety minutes of Pieces pays off with not just one but two dramatic moments guaranteed to make you laugh hysterically; before your very eyes, a bad movie transforms itself into a cult classic. This is powerful stuff indeed.

The trouble really starts forty years in the past when a little boy is quietly putting a puzzle together in his room, bothering no one at all. His mother comes in and goes ballistic, just because the puzzle happens to be one of a naked woman. Our future serial killer is rather upset about all this and decides to calm his mother down by chopping her up with an axe. You have to be impressed by the craftily evil potential of the kid, as he brilliantly sets himself up as horrible victim rather than sadistic mother-killer. His potential lies dormant for forty years, but eventually the nude woman puzzler lover in him reasserts itself. At his adult age, a cardboard puzzle just won't do. What he needs are real human pieces for his ultimate puzzle: a head, torso, arms, etc. Realizing that a college campus is a great place to meet girls, he sets out on a serial killing spree that leaves the local police department more and more dependent on an incredibly annoying student to crack the case. Young Kendall looks like a total dweeb to me, but the ladies seem to love him for some inexplicable reason. The police and college keep the murders hush hush somehow, although prudence would seem to dictate that you warn the public and have them on the lookout for a man carrying a chainsaw. I think the local police force could have used a little outside help on this one; the lead detective doesn't seem to do any real investigating, preferring to sit back and let young Kendall do his work for him. His assistant seems to exist just so the detective can keep asking him for a match for the unlit cigar he keeps in his mouth throughout the film.

There is a good bit of gore in Pieces; death by chainsaw can be pretty messy. For some reason, though, the excessive gore doesn't really have much shock value. A number of really weird plot points are thrown in at odd times, such as the kung fu fighter who shows up for no apparent reason and whose attack manages to leave his foe laughing. As I've said already, though, the ending of this film is what makes Pieces memorable. The movie ends with an unexpected, delightful little surprise, and then, to my initial disappointment, it keeps going. I thought the moviemakers were making a terrible mistake by not ending the movie when they should have, but I was soon surprised and thrilled by an even more unexpected and hilarious finish. Lovers of campy gory horror will get a big kick out of Pieces; it is a shining example of how to make a good ""bad movie.""",1271030400,2,3137,4.52112676056338

Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at just how bad this film was. It was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other.

The film attempts to tell the story of a dark, psychopathic killer, one in which a slasher type of character heads off to splatter damsels in distress.

In reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own jaded philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh).

The movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. What's even worse though is the editing of this film. The film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row.

I think that this was an attempt to emulate films like 'My Bloody Valentine' slasher sequences, but it fails utterly. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene).

Let's get one thing straight, it's not subtle in it's approach and is as badly acted as any of the b movie horrors that were churned out around the same time but what it lacks in quality it makes up for in sheer gory entertainment and scenes so ridiculous they are instantly memorable. The story is riddled with flaws but it all adds to the charm. A kid chops his prudish mother to bits and years later returns to carry on his slicing and dicing dressed up like the comic book character 'The Shadow'.
The film is a gore hounds delight with lots of chainsaw murders, beheadings, limbs being lopped off etc, there's a LHOTL momment where a girl urinates before being killed, there's a crazy bug eyed janitor who may or may not be the killer (this performance in itself is worth the price, if oscars were handed out for evil one eyed stares this guy would win hands down) you also get some crazy kung fu mugger who appears as if he's wandered in from another movie set, lots of gratutious nudity and an ending so stupid you will want to rewind to watch it a few times more just to take it all in.

Long overdue, however, was an ""official"" release, and we have Grindhouse Releasing to thank for that.  The Diamond Entertainment cut just did not do ""Pieces"" any justice.
  What really made ""Pieces"" a classic was its ""unintentional humor.""

But when Kendall, the ""hero,"" arrives, it's all well; it's his kung fu professor, after all. Everybody is laughing and smiling as he says ""...must have been bad chop suey!""

Even the interview with Paul Smith, who played the creepy custodian Willard, was very interesting.

1016212,3,6305385033,"Welcome again my lovers of horror, and for those that have been keeping up with my horror movie reviews. This time around, after having already reviewed ""The Prowler"" and ""The Burning"" I figure I might as well go back to the '80s for another forgotten fan-favorite of the slasher film subgenre known as ""Pieces"".

I came across this movie by coincidence online, and figured I might as well watch it since I had a good 90 minutes of free time. Now, having seen many slasher films, including all EIGHT (count 'em, EIGHT) of the original Friday the 13th films, and the previously mentioned ""The Prowler"" and ""The Burning"", I know my slasher-horror. So I know the feeling of half-satisfaction in my movie lover's gut isn't just indigestion...what we have here is a half-done slasher film.

Don't get me wrong, ""Pieces"" isn't a throwaway movie. There's a sufficient amount of stuff to enjoy here. We got:
-A considerable amount of blood and gore, necessary with basically any slasher film, so it does it's job there.
-Several cases of nudity, also an almost obligatory factor of slashers.
-An opening that grabs your attention, which is a great move on the director's and writer's side.
-A rather hilarious scene featuring one of the most stereotypical Asian guys I've ever seen... the accent, the martial arts skills, the attitude, it's priceless!
-An ending that makes you go OH SNAP!

So we do have plenty of good aspects about this movie, so what gives it the 3-star rating? Well I thought a lot of this movie moved at a rather slow pace. The characters all felt pretty stereotypical, and even though I love myself a good police story, the one presented here wasn't all that exciting. Save the investigative cops for the ""Saw"" series!

Well, that about wraps up this review. Overall, ""Pieces"" is not a bad movie by any means, but coming from a generation that brought us the Friday the 13th and Halloween films, it's been outshined pretty easily. Watch it if you're a slasher film lover and want to watch all the horror movies remembered in the hearts of us gorehounds! Thanks for the time, and peace.

The film attempts to tell the story of a dark, psychopathic killer, one in which a slasher type of character heads off to splatter damsels in distress.

In reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own jaded philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh).

The movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. What's even worse though is the editing of this film. The film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row.

I think that this was an attempt to emulate films like 'My Bloody Valentine' slasher sequences, but it fails utterly. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene).

I give this movie my 'worst slasher film I've ever seen' award. I doubt that it will be topped any time soon.",1243209600,,1350,4.341269841269841
1016215,4,6305385033,"Now, I consider myself a serious film fan, in that I see movies as more than just entertainment, more than just time spent in front of a screen simply zoning out for two hours. Yet I still have this fascination with movies that are ""so-bad-it's-good"", and I'm not above saying that I get a kick out of films that are so inept that I end up enjoying it because of it's sheer stupidity. Directed by Spanish filmmaker Juan Piquer Simon, Pieces is probably the most infamous low-budget slasher flick to ever come out of the subgenre's gory glory days of the early-1980's. It is also the ultimate ""so-bad-it's-good"" horror film!

The movie's pre-credit sequence takes place in 1942 Boston, where a young boy hacks his mother to death after she catches him, and then demeans him, for playing with a jigsaw puzzle of a naked woman. After the credits, the story jumps ahead forty years, and we are at a university where a chainsaw-wielding maniac is dispatching female co-eds and taking severed parts with him. It seems the killer is making a human jigsaw puzzle using parts of his numerous nubile victims. The cops, lead by Christopher George, are (naturally) clueless, so they decide to recruit a former tennis pro (played by George's wife, Linda Day) and a campus ""Casanova"" (played by Ian Sera) to go undercover to catch the sicko.

If the premise alone sounds implausible and dumb, you have heard nothing yet! Pieces is a shamelessly repulsive, badly-written, badly-acted, clumsily-edited, politically-incorrect, degrading, dingy-looking movie. This movie is so bad, and so insulting, by all accounts it should be dumped in the garbage and set on fire. However, by some -I'd say hell spawn- miracle, Pieces manages to be highly enjoyable laugh-filled riot, in addition to actually living up to its massively gruesome hype.

Pieces promises that ""You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre!"" and that ""It's exactly what you think it is!"". Well, I can say that, despite the cheap effects, this is one of the most unapologetically brutal pictures in horror history. Simon takes pleasure in giving the audience exactly what they've paid to see, giving us graphic, and sometimes slow-motion, displays of: hackings, knifings, severed limbs and torsos, entrails, and a never-ending flow of fake blood! Those rather silly taglines and the film's notoriety are definitely not without merit!

It goes without saying that you don't walk into a movie called Pieces expecting to find a deep, psychological thriller. I didn't, and I knew what I was in for. This movie was made long before the days of The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. By the time those films were made, psychology was seen in the culture as a viable tool to catch a serial killer. Pieces was produced in a day and age when horror movies like these (as well as their hard-boiled cop characters) just snickered at such ideas. The serial killer was simply a shock tactic; a cheap way for filmmakers to put more blood and guts on the screen. But that's only the surface of its politically-incorrectness. All of the killer's victims are women, and are hacked in various stages of undress. This is one film that would justify the critics' view of the slasher genre as misogynistic. Also, the dean of the university refers to another character's homosexuality as an ""affliction"". And in one of the picture's many illogical moments, we get a few bad Asian stereotypes thrown in.

But if Pieces is nothing but wanton extreme violence, produced in a time of ignorance, what could possibly make it worthwhile? The only thing more shocking than the gore in Pieces is that the film is so awfully constructed it's actually hysterical! When I say ""many illogical moments"", I mean it! There are a lot of scenes in the movie that leave you crying, ""What the hell?!"" and ""Oh, come on!"" while chuckling at the same time. What's really awful about the script is its complete and utter inability to build any real suspense and its laziness to develop Paul Smith or Jack Taylor as believable suspects. These two guys end up looking useless. The dialogue of the characters and the actors' delivery are so silly, if you close your eyes you'll think you're listening to an episode of Scooby Doo, Where Are You?! But believe it or not, it's the bad script, bad dialogue, and bad acting/dubbing that serve as blessings in disguise. What these shortcomings do is provide Pieces with a lot of unintentional, yet much-needed, humor to offset the extremely graphic and unsettling violence, and in turn, they separate the film from similar, yet oppressively dour and completely irresponsible slasher flicks such as I Spit On Your Grave and Don't Answer the Phone.

There's no doubt that serious film fans and critics will continue to bemoan the existence of Pieces for years to come, but the film wasn't made for them. Pieces is a movie made specifically for the gorehounds; one that actually delivers on the promise of its famous taglines. However, the sacrifices made in order to give the audience what they want results in an unintentionally comedic, and therefore enjoyable, experience for those horror fans that have yet to discover this absurd slasher classic.",1239926400,,5197,4.886621315192744

1016280,4,6305385033,"Back in the 40s, a woman scolds her son for putting together a jigsaw puzzle depicting a naked woman.  Understandably the boy then hacks his mother into...pieces.  Forty years later the killer is on a college campus, and he's determined to finish that jigsaw puzzle, but he's upped the ante and using real chicks.  Why go on a killing spree forty years later when the puzzle could have easily been solved before then?  Hell if I know, this is a slasher film.  Maybe he's just sick of getting screwed on those jigsaw puzzles with the missing pieces they always seems to be selling at Goodwill.  Using a chainsaw and clothed like a killer from an Italian giallo thriller, he goes about the campus collecting whatever body part is needed for the next piece.  If you ask me, a chainsaw really isn't the most efficient tool for a slasher movie killer to use since there seem to be more cons than pros attached to them if you really think about it.  It does get the job done and eliminates all that tiresome hacking with an ax or machete.  A detective played by Christopher George(who everyone should recall played the reporter in Fulci's City of the Living Dead) is on the case and has difficulty...ahem.. piecing together the mystery.  He enlists the help of a womanizing student and a tennis pro(a nice looking piece herself) to sift through the handful of suspects. One of them is the goofy maintenance man played by Paul Smith(the big dude who played the evil warden in Midnight Express), but it's obvious he isn't the killer considering how hard they try to make him look like the killer.  The Dean and the anatomy professor are a little fishy too.  So who is it??  The hell if I'm gonna tell you.
Pieces is a film that has all those ingredients all of us lovers of trashy slasher cinema love.  It's got the nude chicks, the faceless killer, the snazzy soundtrack(which sounds quite a bit like Goblin at times) and gore.  This is slasher movie that has a bit more gore in it than most of the other films of the time.  That's probably because this wasn't done by a major studio like the Friday the 13th films, and probably wasn't under the microscope of the MPAA.  It is a slasher film, but it has that killer with the black gloves and floppy hat that makes it also feel like a giallo.  It also seems to have inspiration from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(the chainsaw of course) and Blood Feast(the collecting of body parts from young women).  I guess you could say that it's pieced together from other horror films.  Grindhouse Releasing have put together another fine 2 disc package for this film, so it's worth the cash if you're thinking about buying it.
To anyone who hasn't seen it and is a fan of the 80s slasher genre, I'd highly recommend it.

It is not really clear what is going on with the killer and his hacking up bodies. Nothing is really explained clearly why he is a warped killer and enjoys hacking up bodies. There is no body to this story other than our killer chopping up bodies on a college campus with looks of horror as people see the cut of body pieces. Some graphically gory films are done in taste, while stuff like this is really just brutally bad & sickening. Gore lovers will enjoy this, even if the plot is thin & the acting is just 'whatever'.

Entertaining, sleazy and gory as hell 1982 Spanish-Puerto Rican-American made horror slasher thriller from the legendary Piquer Simon who directed the MST3K fave ""Pod People"" and ""Slugs"". The film is a bloody riot from the jaw-droppingly disturbing prologue to the must be seen to be believe yet cringe inducing climax that will make any man squirm, the movie co-stars Christopher George (""City of the Living Dead"", ""Graduation Day"" and ""Wonder Woman from 1974""), Paul Smith (Bluto from the 1980 ""Popeye"" movie), Edmund Purdom, and Linday Day George. The film was originally called in Spain ""Night of a Thousand Cries"" while here in the U.S. and other countries it's called ""Pieces"" but released with a different 80's electronic music score in the U.S. version then the brilliant and hauntingly creepy version from the Spanish version with some laughable dubbing. The film does offer ridiculous dialog, hot girls, nudity, shocks, gore galore and one hell of a bizarre ending you won't ever forget as this is one of the most overlooked cult slasher pics ever as it did made a fortune when it came out in 1983 in drive-ins and theaters.

This 2-Disc deluxe edition DVD brings ""Pieces"" in a highly beautiful and stunning high-def transfer that remasters the film's picture and sound quality to a new level including being the uncut, uncensored version. There's also a version where you can watch the film in it's original Spanish language with subtitles and original score with the original spanish opening credits, an audio option where you listen to the film from film theater audiences who saw a midnight screening of the movie.

  I can't even begin to express the excitement I'm feeling, sitting here right now salivating over an Official DVD release of one of my favorite Genre pictures of all time!!! Juan Piquer Simon's PIECES!!!! If you understand as well as have any appreciation for the ""Golden age of Gore"" films (raw horror movies made between 1981 to 1986) or as what they refer to them now as ""Grindhouse Films"" this is a MUST OWN. The only print of this wonderfully little sleazy gorefest that has EVER been available was a BADLY TRANFERRED, washed-out and badly side-cropped fullscreen print (Depending on which label was on the VHS you could tell which ""side"" the film was centered towards in order to avoid showing the ""decapitation in the grass"" aftermath. BUT, I still get great joy out of even for all it flaws) that's been on DVD for all these years in public domain. This is time to rejoice!!!!
  THE FILM: PIECES
  Opening in a flashback with what (at the time, and still is) was one of the most taboo, brutalistic & disturbing axe murders ever shot, the movie quickly leaps to the ""present"" and follows a ""typical"" Italian (even though it's Spanish)Giallo style approach, with Sexy female college co-eds getting slaughtered on campus by a black gloved killer who likes to keep ""trophies"" from each girl (Chainsaws are the killer's fave instrument of destruction). Christopher George and wife Linda Day-George co-star as the stereotype, hardboiled gumshoe and the sexy, sweet undercover cop who starts teaching tennis on campus in order to investigate while remaining under the radar of the killer. (Hopefully.....)
  The movie is FILLED with GREAT kills, beautiful college girls in various states of undress, hystericaly campy one moment and then sucker punches you the next, Dubbing that's so bad at times it actually ADDS to the fun experience, some lines that you can't help but laugh hysterically at (""BAAAAASTARD!!! BAAAAASTARD!!!""LOL) and quote for days, a few good red-herrings to try and keep you on your toes and a reveal and twist ending that most will have probably figured out by the halfway point, but it stays fun and keeps your attention very easily. There's also the wonderful, surprise at the ending that will have men cringing and women laughing for hours, but will have you thinking ""Friday the 13th pt 1"".
  Not a big budget movie. But not a stinker in the cinematography dpt either. The camera is used effectively and the musical score is at times quite creepy & unnerving and REALLY creates some tense moements,reminding you at times of Fabio Frizzi or Goblin with it's 80's synth pulsing rhythmic themes. The scare stabs sound need to be noted as well. Ranking up there with the ""ratchet noise"" from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
  Don't expect 2008 big budget/studio quality here folks. Picture yourself at the filthiest, darkest, scariest movie theater in Manhattan at midnight, with sticky floors and all strangers around you. THAT was the environment you had to go to in order to view this slice of sleaze cinema. It's nasty. It's dark. It's an original taboo breaker. It's gore was not only realistic, but carried impact as well. It actually contains a well thought out ""who's doing it?!"" pace as the cops try to stop the killer from collecting another one of his ""Pieces"". A cool twist and completely fantastic double-shock ending, in the vein of the 1st two Friday the 13th film's cap it all off.

7888398,2,6305385033,"While this may be a cult classic or favorite, you really have to put up with a pretty terrible story line, awful acting, some pretty awful overdubbing, and ridiculous scenarios.  They are so far fetched that they prevent one from effectively ""suspending disbelief"" and just enjoying the film.  I mean, it's one thing to know that you have to turn off your brain and enjoy something, but turning it off this far is pretty difficult.  And the overdubbing - the dialogue is completely overdubbed, as far as I can tell.  Very distracting.  Makes you wonder why it was that way - was the original audio so bad that they couldn't use it?  Anyway, the film was not interesting enough for me to spend the time researching why they overdubbed.  I got this one for a ""horror film fest"" at Halloween, based on the endorsement of Eli Roth (Hostel), and while I'm glad I saw it once, I'm quite certain I'll never watch it again and it was a huge disappointment relative to the endorsement.  Perhaps it has historical significance and should be respected and appreciated for that, but in an of itself it's not good.  Beware.",1450828800,,1110,4.622448979591836
