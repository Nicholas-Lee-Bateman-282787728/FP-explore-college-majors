8208872,2,B000TG6GN0,The show is great love the series. The only problem is the conduction the disks were in made it hard to be read by my device. The case as well was cracked and a little broken. The description from the seller was false on the conduction. they should probably fix and get the disks cleaned up before selling next time. Overall the on the series of Yu Yu Hakusho is amazing,1403827200,,370,4.225352112676056
8208873,3,B000TG6GN0,"The information given for this version of Yu Yu Hakusho is confusing and often, to be nice, not correct.

""Original Import Japanese Artwork - Yu Yu Hakusho DVD Box Set One. This set contains 6 dvds with respective disc holder and dust cover. Each disc is 250 minutes runtime/All Regions - No Inserts included""

--> There are 7 discs, totaling 25 epsiodes (first season) equalling about 600 minutes. The cases are fairly poor construction, so if you think you'll open it often it will break. Each disc is about 69 - 94 minutes (3-4 episodes). No inserts is correct. Can't verify or deny region code.

The discs have cases with titles for the group of episodes, but unless you look on the fine print on the back, nothing to indicate the order. For that you have to open the fragile cases. Even then, the number is rather hard to spot.

From what I've watched so far, the image/sound quality is fine hence the 3 rating, though I've since ordered seasons 3 and 4 from a different printing and may adjust this opinion. Just to be clear, in case this gets shown for something else, the product listing is ""Yu Yu Hakusho Ghost Files- The Spirit Detective Saga- Uncut - Box set (7 DVD)"".

I paid a little under $30 for this used, for seasons 3&4 combined I was able to pay less than that for new. Look around before purchasing this version.",1391126400,2,1332,4.487603305785124
8208874,3,B000TG6GN0,"is it a bootleg?
