Sisters Sharon and Tracey get back together after a falling out over the years. Sharon moves in with Tracey and her son. Then all of the sudden their old friend Dorien, who is an author, moves in with them when she has some troubles. Add another son, girlfriend and daughter and we have a full house of craziness and I love it.

8753160,5,B01CIXVXDY,"BIRDS OF A FEATHER SET 1, Pauline Quirke. This British comedy television serial is an ITV reboot of a BBC1 show that first ran from1989-1998, was one of the most popular, memorable sitcoms of the 1990s. The ITV reboot was its highest-rated comedy in over a decade. With this DVD release, everyone's favorite Essex girls return. As created by legendary screenwriters Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, (THE NEW STATESMAN, SHINE ON HARVEY MOON), the series chronicles the misadventures of Sharon and Tracey (Pauline Quirke , BROADCHURCH;  Linda Robson, SHINE ON HARVEY MOON), North London-born sisters left to fend for themselves, both financially and emotionally, when their husbands are jailed for armed robbery. The girls have gone their separate ways, not spoken for years, lived very different lives. Tracey has enjoyed the neo-Georgian splendor of 'Dalentrace', luxury home in Chigwell paid for by husband Darryl's criminal activities, while her sister suffered in a threadbare  Edmonton public housing tower block. Now, Sharon moves in with Tracey to enjoy a few home comforts, offer moral support. And if life sometimes seems a little dull, there are always the antics of their former and once again friend/man-eating Jewish neighbor, Dorien (Lesley Joseph, NIGHT & DAY), who has rebooted herself as Foxy Cohen, written a best-selling erotic memoir, SIXTY SHADES OF GREEN.

The trio  finds themselves facing financial trouble, move in together. They deal with low-wage jobs, dubious tattoos, kidsand exesturning up on their doorstep, soon find themselves with a full house.  Mind you, theres a serious heart to this all new comedy as the sisters, their friends and family face the dramas, tragedies, stresses, strains of keeping up with the world without their husbands support. But this beloved Britcom, returning after a 15-year hiatus, has stood the test of time and come out on the other side more brilliant and chaotic than ever (Belfast Telegraph, UK). The episodes are:
1. Gimme Shelter. Sisters Tracey and Sharon haven't spoken in years, so when they run into each other at a Foxy Cohen book signing, the meeting is not amiable. However, when Tracey finds out Sharon lives in a run-down flat, she invites her sister to stay with her again.
2. Slave. Everyone at the house feels pressed for cash; Tracey and Sharon convince Dorien to sell her pricey designer duds at the flea market. The sale goes well, enough.  But Tracey is still overwhelmed by the bills; Sharon takes Dorien to get a job at World of Quid.
3. Hot Stuff. Tracey, Sharon end up sleeping in the living room. Sharon is unable to sleep because of all the noise in the house, tries the attic, where she makes a welcome find.
4. Hearts for Sale. Traceys older son Garth, returned from Australia with wife and child in tow, dreams of opening his own restaurant, but the run-down building he plans to use  needs repair. The plumber takes a liking to Tracey, asks her on a date. Dorien visits an elderly man she hopes to marry for his money.
5. Tattoo You. Sharon, Tracey, Dorien commiserate over the pains of growing older when Sharon fears she is going deaf. Later, Tracey fumes when she finds her younger son Travis got a tattoo to impress a girl.
6. Blinded by Love. Sharon's estranged husband, Chris, shows up to ask for a quick divorce so that he can marry his new blind girlfriend, Angie, who reveals she is a Foxy Cohen fan; Dorien, Sharon, and Tracey are invited to the engagement party.
7. Back to Zero. Dorien resigns from her position at World of Quid when she finds her novel in the bargain bin. Sharon is fired; Tracey has to quit her job. No money coming in; the women, freezing cold from having to turn off the furnace, argue heatedly.
8. You Can't Always Get What You Want. Sharon,Tracey meet two elderly sisters at the supermarket; wonder what they will be like in the future. Dorien goes to court to defend her book Sixty Shades of Green against a  plagiarism charge.

The character-driven comedy was filmed before a live audience; the giggles, one-liners abound: I particularly liked Doriens remark that she had graduated from the Barbra Streisand Academy for Ambitious Jewish Girls.  But then, I would. And reboot it may be, but it doesnt feel dated. I received this box set in contemplation of an honest, unbiased review.  It consists of a single disc, eight episodes  running approximately 184 minutes. Its got subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not up on our rhyming Cockney slang. It also includes for the first time the 1989 Christmas Special, does have some mild sexual situations. But if you could use a laugh or three, this is just the ticket.",1465689600,2,4651,4.8734177215189876
8753161,5,B01CIXVXDY,"3 ladies of Chigwell (real London suburb) end up back together in Traceys house. The one liners come fast and furious. Careful, your laughing may cause you to miss the next gag. Another hit for the after-30s viewers. But millennials might like to see where they could be headed too. A revived hit series of 1989 with a contemporary feel. A laugh a minute; no more. A refreshing change from all the UK crime/ blood/ murder series of late. Studio-filmed with a live audience.

Same old cast: Sharon (Pauline Quirke Broadchurch); Tracey (Linda Robson); Dorien (Lesley Joseph).
New cast: Travis (Charlie Quirke) and Garth (Matt Willis) sons of Tracey; Marcie (Camilla Beeput).
Note: Pauline Quirke is real-life mom to Charlie Quirke.
