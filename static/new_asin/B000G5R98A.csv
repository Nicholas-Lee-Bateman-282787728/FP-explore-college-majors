2600076,1,B000G5R98A,"when I first came across Bone Sickness, I was new to unearthed films. I had only seen Aftermath and Nails, probably a few others. I thought to myself ""Wow, this production company knows what its doing! Nothing they produce could be horrible."" So, I gave Bone Sickness a shot, and this movie completely proved my opinion on unearthed films wrong. The gore is medicre at best and the plot is horrible, the acting... just everything. I found this movie to be unwatchable and I am very open minded about low-budget, independt movies. But no. Don't waste your time. It isn't even campy its just bad. I feel the same about City f Rott. Animated gore? Hell, they could take that so far! but they don't. its the same zombie being killed for 2 hours and its boring. How the hell do you mess up a cartoon about zombies? The art looks good but it isn't AMAZING. Both of these movies should be lifted from unearthed because its a shame they are produced by the same company that produced Aftermath. Sheesh.",1228176000,3,994,4.527777777777778
2600077,1,B000G5R98A,"For the people who have rated this movie 'decent' considering the micro-budget of this film, I'm sorry but I have to disagree.
I should preface this review by stating that I really enjoy movies with little or no budget, such as this one, if they are done with some intent to be a reasonable attempt to portray the writers vision.  This movie was disappointing even considering the limitations under which it was created.

So, down to brass tacks.  The acting is understandably horrible, but its the role that the director himself plays which really kills this whole movie.  Something about his perfectly coiffured red mullet, which remains perfect until the imminent blood spray at the end and his ""yeah, I cut up corpses and give you the meat"" attitude while he fixed his perfect Kentucky waterfall.

Which brings me to another point- This movie is highly confusing.  A simple splatter flick would have been much easier to watch than all the rhetoric about necromancy and feeding human remains back to an infected person - who is also so underdeveloped to the point that you just wish he would have died in the first five minutes anyway.

The gore is mostly watery blood, plastic skeletons and Halloween props, meal-worms, some pet scorpions (which had no relevant point or scare factor), and buckets of earthworms which actors constantly spit out of their mouths for some unknown reason...  Constantly chewing and spitting earthworms on the floor isn't really gore.  The three nude scenes hardly justify sitting through the rest of the movie you would have to endure.

Somehow amongst this less-than-mediocre attempt at a movie there is a car crash where a Buick flips over and explodes.  Apparently this is where all the money and effort were wasted in the making of this film.

It ends with a long credit list, mostly consisting of the director's 50 different roles in this movie, and a video recap of all the people you never cared about in the movie to begin with, and an advertisement to buy the album of the death-metal band playing throughout the credits.

Worst I've ever seen... and that's pretty pathetic.",1223251200,3,2117,4.847222222222222
2600078,1,B000G5R98A,"They attempt to tell a story which has so many holes and missing parts to it, that it ruined the entire movie for me. I won't go into the story since it was actually explained alot better in a few sentences in the reviews above then it was in an hour and a half movie.  Also the acting was bad, make-up was bad, the sets were bad and the sub-plot with Demons at the end made it worse. A low-budget movie that you couln't even laugh at, now Flesheater was a low-budget movie I laughed at, for example. Not worth your time, but when you have mixed reviews (the reason why I had to see it), I understand if you do.

 The best part is the nudity, of course featuring full frontal of porn star Ruby Larocca.",1216252800,2,702,4.109489051094891
2600079,2,B000G5R98A,"Bone Sickness (Brian Paulin, 2004)

It should be obvious going into a movie like Bone Sickness that you're not getting a Hollywood-quality flick here. (And forget anything approaching Asian cinema.) But then you don't watch movies like Bone Sickness looking for the next George Romero or Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie. This is basement-budget filmmaking, and when it turns its baleful eye to horror, that means that about 90% of the budget is going for special effects. So you can forget decent sets, decent acting, decent camerawork, etc., etc. When you look at it from that perspective... okay, Bone Sickenss is still a pretty awful movie. But it got me to do something I haven't done in ten years-- turn away from the screen during a particular scene. I simply couldn't watch it. (You'll know the scene when you get to it, I'm sure).

The plot, what there is of one: Alex McNetti (Rich George) is suffering from a degenerative bone disease. His loving wife Kristen (Darya Zabinski), unsatisfied with the attempts of conventional medicine to cure her husband, has turned to Alex's best friend Thomas Granger (Brian Paulin), who practices a sort of alternative medicine you won't find in the phone book. The only problem is that the folks upon whom he's been practicing-- the dead ones, that is, from whom he harvests the bone meal he uses to make Alex's medicine-- aren't terribly happy with him. And so they come back. And they want revenge. You know the drill.

I have a tendency to try and find the good in just about any movie I watch, and I have to say that it might have well stretched beyond surprisingly effective special effects in a few scenes and gratuitous nudity from Zabinski and Ruby Larocca (who plays Granger's wife Andrea, who, along with everyone else, suspects Thomas of cheating on her with Kristin-- oh, if only they knew the truth!). The structure of the film is solid, and the climactic confrontation between Thomas and Alex, had both George and Paulin been decent actors, could have been quite powerful-- the dialogue there is the best in the movie. It's not, however. There's not much at all I can say to recommend this, but if you're a fan of low-budget zombie flicks, I'd still say to give it a try. Rented, of course, not bought, but Paulin did manage to do some decent things with no money at all. **",1212105600,,2325,4.707616707616707
2600080,3,B000G5R98A,"Enough already with the living dead! The subgenre has really been beaten to death (sorry), and unless you can add something new and different, there should be a moratorium on zombies/living dead for at least the next decade. There are plenty of other horrific subjects; moreover, bad zombie films FAR outnumber the good ones. So PLEASE let the dead rest for a while...Now that I've gotten that off my chest, BONE SICKNESS is kind of fun in its cut-rate fashion. One can spot many homages to 1970s and 1980s Euro-trash, as well as Romero, H. G. Lewis, GUINEA PIG, and so on. There is even a swipe of a key scene from ANTHROPOPHAGUS, as though we really needed to see that again! From a gore-and-gratuitous-nudity standpoint, BONE SICKNESS delivers the goods, with enough gross FX shots for ten movies. Director Brian Paulin also acted, wrote the screenplay, created the makeup FX and even provided the musical score. (One cue shamelessly apes Akira Ifukube's Oxygen Destroyer theme from GODZILLA!) There are indications that Paulin could make interesting films if given the resources, but the interview, conducted by one ""Uncle Creepy"", makes them both seem rather lowbrow. I guess you're out of touch unless you frequently drop the F-bomb and dismiss all professional product out of hand. Brian's FX work isn't bad for the pygmy budget, and he manages some pretty good compositions within the confines of camcorder-based cinematography. On the other hand, he is easily the best actor in the cast (enough said), the story is virtually non-existent, and there are awkward cuts that effect dialogue. (not the DVD's fault; video quality is fine.) Despite complaints about the ""ugly"" women, I think they're all fine eye candy if not real actresses. Bottom Line: if you want a ""can you take it"" type of film to disrupt your next get-together, you could do worse than to show BONE SICKNESS. All but the most jaded necro-junkies will very likely be appalled...If I may ask once more: NO MORE ZOMBIES! (for at least ten years)",1203292800,,2017,4.9178885630498534
2600081,2,B000G5R98A,"It was terrible. The blood looked like Kool-Aid, the voice acting was terrible, bad actors, with an overweight porn star on it who coulden't keep her clothes on. You could sometimes hear the motor from the camera and it was just an overall bad movie. I couldn't help but laugh about how cheesy and poorly made it was though.",1179532800,,324,4.508474576271187
2600082,4,B000G5R98A,"...The first time I found out about this movie was actually through here, while doing a search for horror movies.  I read the reviews and they were all bad, so I didn't get the movie. A while back I purchased ""Frankenhooker"" (great film--check out my review for it), and watched the trailer for ""Bone Sickness"" and it caugth my attention. I finally gave it a chance and ordered it, and I was not at all disappointed. First off, let me tell you about these bad reviews: they came from people that didn't even finish watching the entire film. Yes, the begining is a little slow, but after 30-40 minutes or so the movie picks up and never stops. Yes it is a low budget movie, but it is well done. There is a tremendously huge amount of blood and gore, plenty of nudity (and no the girls are not ugly as one reviewer mentioned), and a whole lot of zombies. I particularly like the look of the zombies, they are not up there with Fulci zombies, but they look creepy in their own way. The first half of the film is slow paced, the latter half picks up and never stops until it ends. I am amazed at all of the effects accomplished for a low budget flick.  This, I will say is one of the best low budget movies I've seen in a while. Certainly better than some of the Troma stuff out there. The DVD is also loaded with extras such as behind the scenes (very cool), commentary, and other stuff.  I honestly don't have a clue as to why these other reviewers rated it so low, perhaps they should have finished watching the entire film before they reviewed it. This is a truly unique zombie flick, and a definite must add to any horror collection.",1171238400,4,1634,4.298701298701299
2600083,5,B000G5R98A,"This is one film for people who, put ideas and enthusiasm above big budget eye candy. if you don't mind micro budget films this one really delivers on the gore. I have to hand it to the makers they have created a film that will become a future horror classic with next to no money. so if you are tired of the normal horror stuff that gives tv teens and not much else, or if you are open to low budget film makeing give this one a go its one of the best of its type out there.",1164931200,6,475,3.857142857142857
2600084,1,B000G5R98A,"1st thing 1st, this is low budget..... very, very low.the acting = not good.the soundtrack = not good. the special effex = not good. On the dvd box it claims to be 'on par with any of Fulci's zombie films... this has nothing to do with italian movies of the 70's. It takes 40 minutes before we even see a zombie and to be honnest they don't look good. This movie is a bunch of friends with a camera with nothing else to do. The only thing i liked is the blonde girl when she took of her shirt. It says it on the box : we dare you to watch the whole movie.... your right, i didint !!",1162857600,5,582,3.899159663865546
2600085,3,B000G5R98A,"I can't believe this little movie has finally grown up and gone on to play with the big boys (as its upcoming release shows). Well done to it! I viewed it as a VCD bootleg a year ago now, and it is well worth seeing. Low budget, oh yes. Acting, pretty damn poor. Buckets of blood, definately. Mandatory low budget [..] out scenes, yep. Fantastic last 3 minutes (I watched the ending again and again, I was so taken by it). But please, make no mistake, you're not in for high art, you're not in for middle ground art, you're in for an amateur who loves his stuff and has done what can be done with no money. (Oh, and a word to the filmmaker, the Goblins are just silly!) See it, please, and enjoy it for what it is - a B movie that enjoys being a B movie, and is not afraid to use some gore.",1154995200,11,790,4.006329113924051
8128889,5,B000G5R98A,"A modern underground horror classic, for underground shot-on-video horror fans or those who think they might be. Others probably need not watch. This is like the original Night of the Living Dead if made for the total underground set. It does for the low budget shot-on-video film made in Maryland what Night- did for independents made in Pennsylvania. Bone Sickness starts as a sort of medical horror tale, with merciless, skin-crawling grossout scenes of a man with a leukemia-like illness suffering in his home, and of how overly desperate measures to help him lead to supernatural results.  It then turns into a relentless zombie-ghoul massacre that goes on for the entire remainder of the  film and pulls out every last possible stop. With hardly any budget, director Paulin works wonders as the gore and blood splatters to an extent never imagined in sterile mainstream horror films. And the zombie makeup and choreography is impressive in a Lucio Fulci-like way. In the seemingly endless battle that takes up the latter  part of the film, cops and soldiers and everybody keep coming to a zombie-infested neighborhood, and keep getting torn apart and eaten by the dozens, the ""heroes"" having little effect, again as in Fulci. Unlike the underground horrors of, say, a Todd Sheets, where much of the fun comes from the over-the-top, homemade camp of the bloodshed, the atmosphere here is impressively dark and disturbing throughout, the no-budget look and amateur performances driving this home more effectively than any ""better"" budget or ""professional"" acting would. What is called ""quality"" is the first that goes out the window in this sort of in-your-face rebel horror, so expect uneveness and a crazy look as part of the making of this purely UNDERGROUND work of art.",1467417600,,1778,5.082191780821918

8128891,5,B000G5R98A,"By any sane standards, this is a terrible movie, but there's something so in-your-face about its total lack of taste or propriety or redeeming qualities, that I can't help loving it.  The special effects are well-nigh overwhelming; they must have mixed hundreds of gallons of fake blood, puke, and pus for this undertaking (no pun intended).  The scene where the guy retches up gobbets of maggots and proceeds to eat them again... what can one say?  The film is a delight in a demented kind of way.",1393200000,,498,4.7011494252873565
8128892,5,B000G5R98A,"""Bone Sickness"" is Brian Paulin's unbelievably resourceful shot on video splatter movie. About half of its running time dedicated to gory happenings, though several of the atmospheric chiller scenes work quite well (especially the pool sequence). Thankfully, this movie is NOT at all ironic or post modern or comedic in its approach, but an earnest indie horror movie--- one that is a total 100% pleasure to watch. It just glows with a bright love of the genre (creepy and fun splatter). And it has EXCELLENT music.

As with much of indie horror, the writer/director is a special effects guy like Timo Rose & Olaf Ittenbach over in Germany.  Creepy, resourceful and inventive, ""Bone Sickness"" is a celebration of horror and indie film fire. If you can accept (or embrace) its DIY flaws, it smolders and shambles like Fulci in a Manhole with perhaps some hints of bizarro literature and Tetsuo: Iron Man oddity.  Seek out and enjoy.  (And Brian Paulin's Fetus is even better.)

8128894,2,B000G5R98A,"Truthfully, I was left frustrated. I love indie horror and low budget gorefests as much as the next weirdo, but this was far too amateurish on too many levels for me to actually enjoy. let's just establish some pros and cons, shall we?

pros: 1) not a bad concept, really. you've got the illness-coping aspect on the part of Alex and his girlfriend a la ""I, Zombie"", the friend with access to corpses and the ability to experiment on them a la Herbert West (much of the background music sounds identical to scenes from Re-Animator), and vengeful zombies; which all sounds pretty cool. 2) some of the shots taken - namely the stills - work effectively to set tones. 3) good mix of gross-out (kudos to the dude that played Alex!) and gore sequences, the latter of which was largely well done and realistic. this is surely where the entire budget for the movie went, however, as we explore...

cons: 1) the props, costumes, set pieces etc. appear to have been bought in the dollar bin at walgreens. 2) truly atrocious acting, but not even the endearing kind. that one detective wasn't horrible, but man, the rest of it was painful. no one appeared to care whatsoever if/when/that they were on screen. 2) obnoxious amounts of female nudity. it made the movie drag, and there's just nothing erotic about a boob or two simply being exposed. sorry, bro,  i'm not an 8 year old. 3) last, but not least: the editing. holy mother of god, the editing. all of it. completely destroyed any potential for professionalism.

i applaud the people involved with this one for their efforts, but their execution fell short by my standards. if this was an entry to a high school film contest that had a one week deadline, then i'd understand, but...come on, now.",1340755200,2,1741,4.642857142857143
