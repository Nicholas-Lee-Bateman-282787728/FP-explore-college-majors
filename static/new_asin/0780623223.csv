35267,4,0780623223,"The least one can say about ZERO EFFECT is that the script is very intelligent and reveals the work of a genuine writer. Jake Kasdan has certainly read the adventures of Conan Doyle's super detective Sherlock  Holmes with great delight. Like Holmes, bill Pullman likes to teake drugs  (amphetamines for Bill, heroin for Sherlock) and to play music (guitar  while Holmes had a predilection for violin) when he's out of work. Like  Holmes, Bill stays away from women who could deconcentrate him and loves to  surprise his audience with his wonderful sense of observation and the  amazing logic of his deductions. His only problem : Watson isn't a Doctor  but a lawyer who will not (ungrateful Ben Stiller !) write the story of the  numerous cases he has solved during his career. So he has to open his PC  and do the job himself. The scene in which Bill Pullman tries to find keys  in Ryan O'Neal's office is undoubtedly an homage to E. A. POE's detective  Auguste Dupin in THE PURLOINED LETTER (1845 !). In fact, nothing new under  the sun ! But these references are discreetly hidden in this movie and  demands a constant attention in order to appreciate them. ZERO EFFECT is  the first movie of Jake Kasdan and I look forward for his next films with  great impatience.

This a great overlooked movie.  And Ben Stiller, although wonderful in his role, isn't even close to being the star here.  That honor goes to Bill Pullman, followed closely by Kim Dickens, and then Ryan O'neill.  All the parts are very well acted, and Stiller is no exception, but other than name recognition, I can't imagine why Amazon would choose to put his name down as the star, when he obviously isn't.

The movie itself is a very clever update of the classic Sherlock Holmes/Dr. Watson private investigating team, complete with Holmes (Pullman) making ALL the relevant decisions which more often than not go completely over the head of Watson (Stiller).  The result is brilliant.  Add to the mix the fact that Kim Dickens turns out to be THE Woman, which Doyle fans will recognize without any trouble, you get a very enjoyable and intelligent reworking of Sherlock Holmes set realistically and believably in modern times.  Oh, and even people who are unfamiliar with Sherlock Holmes will enjoy it -- it's that good.  But NOBODY will come away with the idea that Ben Stiller was the star.  It's just not true.  I'm sure Stiller himself would agree.  Ask him.",1444867200,2,1180,4.8159203980099505

35308,5,0780623223,"Before there was Jonny Lee Miller, before there was Benedict Cumberbatch, before there was Robert Downey, Jr., there was Bill Pullman.

Zero Effect is a little known Sherlock Holmes redux that crackles with the same humor and energy [and slash potential] as all the current Sherlock Holmes franchises.  In this updated version of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" Pullman plays Darryl Zero, a drug-addled, eccentric, misanthropic genius of a private eye, who solves crimes for hire with the help his staid, loyal and rock-steady assistant - the long suffering Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller).  Both actors create unique and likeable versions of their well-known literary counterparts.  Pullman, as the shambolic detective, is hilariously manic one moment and oddly touching the next, in what is a surprisingly nuanced performance.  And Stiller is a revelation.  Up until I saw this film, I was never a fan, but he's completely winning as the levelheaded sourpuss Arlo.

And the contemporary updates (e.g., instead of a violin, Zero writes lame rock songs on an acoustic guitar) work surprisingly well.  Like the BBC Sherlock, Zero uses modern technology to aid his investigations.  Of course, in the late 1980's technology was hardly what it is today, as evidenced by the room full of oversized computers he sits in at night working on his memoirs.  The dialogue is cleverly written, full of comedy gems, such as this attempt by Zero to explain his crime-solving methodology,  ""...the essence of my work relies fundamentally on two basic principles: objectivity and observation, or `the two obs' as I call them.""

The two obs.  Priceless.

Plus, the soundtrack is stupendous - Elvis Costello, Dan Bern, Bond and a classic from Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, to name a few.

Yes, the crime and the solution are totally preposterous, but isn't that so with all the Sherlock Holmes stories - the adaptations as well as the originals?  Anyone who is looking for verisimilitude in their criminal investigations should not be looking to Arthur Conan Doyle, for sure.

I suggest any fan of the BBC Sherlock, Elementary or the Guy Ritchie films add this to your Netflix queue post haste.  It's a perfect addition to anyone's collection of Sherlock Holmes homages.  It's hip, funny, clever, even a bit poignant in places.  Trust me...you'll love it.",1411689600,,2318,5.05

Jake Kasdan's first film takes the Holmes tale A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA and gives it an excellent modern twist while creating characters right out of Conan Doyle's world with a fresh spin. Bill Pullman as Daryl Zero (love that name) and Ben Stiller as Arlo are a superb Holmes and Watson and you can see how this film paved the way for those two fine TV shows that the world can't get enough of.

35342,4,0780623223,"The detective sleuthing story was remarkably entertaining for a first time project for the young  Jake Kasdan.  Daryl Zero (Bill Pullman) is a remarkable detective, the best in the world, who has achieved his success through his ability to remain a dispassionate and thorough observer.  The case of the missing keys starts off innocently enough, but the amount of money being paid to locate them represent a much darker crime.  Zero is quite capable at blending in and remaining invisible.  The difficulty comes from when he actually has to interact with the world.  For this he has come to rely on his assistant, Arlo, enjoyably played by Ben Stiller, who quite frankly has had enough with the bizarre mannerisms and seemingly unreasonable and unnecessary demands placed upon him to support Zero's investigations.  In this case, the blackmailer's identity and the missing keys themselves are identified by Zero remarkably quickly, leaving Daryl to work out the primary difficulties of the  wherefores and whys.  Zero will not conclude the case until he can determine the actual relationship between the various parties.  As he moves to investigate the attractive young blackmailer he begins to play a dangerous game that may undermine the dispassionate qualities that had served and protected him thus far.

35344,5,0780623223,"This movie is a must see! I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, but Darryl Zero is so ""outside the box"" that he's a pleasure to watch. Bill Pullman does a terrific job, as a the genious, but socially imcompetent, and seriously (but brilliantly) disturbed Darryl Zero. There are comparisons to Holmes, including a reference to the effect that he does not have the luxury of having a Watson to record his methods, and chronicle his cases...and so: ""I'm forced to do it myself."" Like Holmes, he misses nothing and anticipates everything, but the way that Darryl explains his ""methods"" (in that soft style of Bill Pulman) are so brilliant, and so true, that his explanations (as brilliant as they are) seem so obvious, so as to be humorous...even as you say: ""Wow! That's brilliant!"" His love interest is a breath of fresh air and, in her own way, an equal...a ""match"" for the brilliance of Darryl Zero. Unlike Holmes, however, who merely solves a crime, or mystery, and apprehends the culprit, solving the mystery is but the begining for Darryl. He solves the case almost instantly, but his curiosity then turns to the ""Why?"" So that, rather than apprehending the suspect, Darryl sets out to determine the emotions, and the motive underlying the mystery. Unlike most dectective movies, this movie revolves around his pursuit of the answer to that question. Like Holmes he uses various disguises that, now knowing Darryl, bring a smile to the viewer. Like Holmes with ""the woman"" one senses that for Daryl, his love interest, in this case Gloria, will always be, well...""the only one"".

35356,4,0780623223,"Saw this a while back and it is a movie to watch again. Let me list the strengths and weaknesses.

Strengths: Good acting especially with the leads: Bill Pullman and Kim Dickens who have a great chemistry. Writing and Story: A well written yarn obviously with nods to other stories. What I love is that it is an intelligent story with some realism and where the characters use their minds and hearts. There is no chase scene. There is no action. But there is suspense because of the story. That is what makes this movie stand out -- that Jake Kashdan, could make a really intriguing movie without tricks. Zero actually solves the whodunnit very early on and yet the movie continues on intriguing because of who actually did it and why that person is doing it.

Weaknesses: What keeps me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is that there are some inconsistencies to it. It almost looks like the movie started as more of a crazy comedy and then became more reigned in as a more serious effort. Once the movie gets going, the over the top comedy is toned down to smart humor and just smart writing. Some of the directing is way overdone such as a restaurant scene with Stiller and O'Neal where the director (maybe for a technical reason) does not feel comfortable showing the actors and pans in from a low under the table view which always annoys me to no end. Stiller did a good job but ultimately his character is whiny beyond what he has a right to be. The stuff with Stiller and his girlfriend is more a detracting plot device than anything else. I understand why it was important for the main character to lose his ""Dr. Watson"" but it was not executed real well.

Great scenes: The fire alarm scene. Stiller in the park (with the rental kid)with O'Neal. Stiller & O'Neal outside the motel. The office search scene. The planetarium scene. The gun shooting scene. The ice cream and bed scene. The airport with Dickens scene. The hotel mattress scene. The blow up with Stiller and Pullman scene in the hotel scene.

Overall a real entertaining but flawed movie that is worthwhile owning as it stands up to multiple viewings. Enjoy!",1255046400,,2133,4.546875
35357,4,0780623223,"Daryl Zero is one of the most peculiar private investigators you will ever meet. His quirks make you more fond of him for in fact they show his humanity. Some may think of him like a modern Sherlock Holmes. Afterall both are brilliant and passionate about their work. Holmes had a case involving a spy once that he fell for and her demise hurt him deeply. Although this case is not about spies, it is a complicated case involving missing keys, an old tape, a lock box, blackmail, and a murder scene that takes time to unravel. Zero is assisted by Steve Arlo, a lawyer that is capable at keeping Daryls identity hidden, being the face the clients see, and good at some background casework as well. Once we see all the pieces of the puzzle we are happy to have been let in on the case and the outcome. It may not be clear as to the fate of the woman Zero falls in love with, but we have an idea there is a chance he will meet her again. As for Zero's case name, brevity is something he needs to become familiar with if he plans to sell it to a publisher. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The cast really do a superb job in their roles and the story was interesting and kept me drawn to the movie. Anyone in your family that enjoys good mysteries probably will like it. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Bloodwork"".

35358,3,0780623223,"The ideas here are very clever. But this turns out to be more of a ""tell the audience what's going on"" movie than show them. People talk about what they're going to do, what they've done, what they're doing. There's a lot of talk and little action. For some kinds of movies, that's fine. But for this kind of movie it just doesn't seem to quite work. Of course you can consider this to be a very offbeat detective story, which is what it is, true. But the characters are just not involving enough to counterbalance the offbeat quality of the movie.

We don't really get a fully humanized portrait of Daryl Zero, the title character. As for his assistant, Steve Arlo, we know he's getting tired of working with Zero, but that seems to be the main trait that comes across characterizing him, which doesn't do much to flesh him out either. As for the ""bad guy"", Ryan O'Neal, he's bland. Zero's love interest, played by Kim Dickens, is the most fully realized character in the movie but when you bounce that characterization against someone who we don't have a fully developed character for, it just doesn't feel like there's a legit reason for the two of them to hook up.

35360,3,0780623223,"THE first film from Jake Kasdan, the son of famed director Lawrence Kasdan (Pacific Heights, The Big Chill), is a detective comedy that works off a premise so obvious it's surprising it hasn't been exploited more often.

Zero Effect steals the Sherlock Holmes mystery formula and places it into a contemporary context. The problem with Kasdan's film is that it doesn't get much beyond this modestly clever idea. Mixing excessive plot intricacies and broad, quirky comedy, the film ends up as a mildly puzzling sophomoric diversion.

The self-styled ""world's greatest detective"" is Daryl Zero, played by Bill Pullman (Independence Day). He's a twitchy character, hair askew, eyes glazed and living in Howard Hughes-like isolation. As is often the case, Pullman seems to be in an acting class of his own, experiencing complicated inner surges and thoughts that don't have much to do with his character.

This is hardly the ""cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind"" of Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, though the parallels are deliberate. Instead of cocaine, Zero imbibes amphetamines; instead of playing the violin, he plays loud, squawky confessional songs on his acoustic guitar. But armed with the latest in information-gathering technology and arcane knowledge -- bylaws governing motel bed placement for the past 30 years -- Zero solves cases with magical precision. The Watson of the story, Steve Arlo, is played robotically by Ben Stiller (Flirting with Disaster). He's a resentful sidekick who gets drunk and complains incessantly about his employer while trying desperately to have an ordinary romantic life after office hours. He works as a front man for Zero, maintaining strict client confidentiality, and collecting big fees.

At the beginning of the film, Arlo is in a meeting with lumber tycoon Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a client of Zero's who is searching for missing keys to a safety deposit box, but who is also being blackmailed for a secret he will not reveal. In short order, Zero has figured out who is doing the blackmailing: a paramedic (a tough gamine played by Kim Dickens, who makes a strong impression here as she does in Great Expectations) who works at Stark's health club. In his quest to expose her motives, Zero gradually finds himself falling in love for the first time in his life, a fallibility that never afflicted Sherlock Holmes.

The movie then changes directions to concentrate on the love story, while Arlo continues his quest to break free of his boss so he can enjoy a fling of his own. The plot is complicated, relying on Zero's weird knowledge and observational skills. But the momentum is gone long before the movie ends and one is left only with a faint sense of curiosity.

35361,5,0780623223,"If Sherlock Holmes were alive today he would be a major pain in the neck. That seems to be the central message of Jake Kasdan's first film, which is among my favourite movies of all time.

Bill Pullman plays Daryl Zero, the greatest private detective who ever lived, who also happens to be completely hopeless when it comes to relating to other human beings, in particular to his long-suffering assistant, Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller). However, when he is hired to find a blackmailer, he comes into contact with and ultimately falls in love with Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens), a modern day version of Irene Adler.

This is a very well made and enjoyable film, and it interesting (and very funny) to see Kasdan's idea of what Sherlock Holmes would be like if he were alive today. With the exception of Kim Dickens, who didn't strike me as being a strong enough actress to play ""the woman"", all of the actors in this film are excellent. I was particularly impressed by Stiller in one of his rare ""straight"" roles and the way in which Pullman and Stiller work together and don't overshadow each other.

35363,3,0780623223,"Zero Effect (Jake Kasdan, 1998)

I saw this movie a few days ago, and have been mulling it over in my head ever since. I'm still trying to figure out if I liked it or not. I think so, but can't be sure.

Darryl Zero (While You Were Sleeping's Bill Pullman) is a private detective. Except he's a very odd private detective. He never meets with clients, always talking to them through his intermediary Steve Arlo (Keeping the Faith's Ben Stiller). He is quite capable of doing his job, and doing it well, but when he's off the clock, he turns into a neurotic wreck (did you ever see Creepshow? Think E. G. Marshall, but the sloppy version). Zero accepts a case from Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a wealthy chap who's being blackmailed. He won't say what he's being blackmailed about, of course. The farther into the case Zero gets, the odder things become, and on top of it all he finds himself extremely attracted to Gloria Sullivan (Thank You for Smoking's Kim Dickens), a paramedic he meets in the course of investigation.

Kasdan's feature film debut is a fun little flick, at least. Pullman is surprisingly good in the role, a definite change from the calm, tightly-wound types he normally plays. This is also one of those rare films where Ben Stiller shows that he can, in fact, act. Dickens also turns in an above-average performance, but everyone else involved seems rather dull; even O'Neal seems to be doing a (rather passable) attempt at a William Shatner impersonation. Amusing for what it is, but is loses its lustre when carried on for an entire film. Angela Featherstone, playing Arlo's girlfriend, seems thrown into the film solely for eye candy (the subplot that develops because her character exists could have been done in a number of ways), and the majority of the minor characters seem to be there for window dressing more than anything else. Also, the pace could have used a bit of tightening.

Still, not a bad movie by any means; it's just a first film, with many of the hallmarks of a first film. ** ",1141171200,4,2022,4.636871508379889

The pacing is irregular, dragging through characterizations then spurting forward with developments, and then repeating the cycle (which, admittedly, isn't necessarily a detraction from a movie, but I noticed it and didn't like it in this one).

35389,5,0780623223,"Jake Kasdan himself, the director of ""Zero Effect,"" admitted that the Detective-Story plot is a Hollywood favorite. Having admitted that, he went on to create one of the best movies I've seen, and certainly the best I've seen in this genre, while at once adhering to the rules of the detective story and creating such a sharp, intelligently written story that it makes you shake your head.
There is so much to love about this movie I hesitate to begin. How about with the dialogue? From the first line, the dialogue is precise, subtle and funny. Someone famous once stressed that subtlety is key to lasting humor, and this script is exemplary; it's as funny the tenth time I watch it as it was the first. For once, we get to laugh at the detective hero, to laugh at his human flaws, as well as marvel at his methods.
Ben Stiller is a master of the human kettle of frustration, and is a great counterpoint to Pullman's various quirks. I didn't like Stiller much before this film, but have since become a staunch fan thanks to his performance here. Kim Dickens was fantastic, as was the role created for her. Detective movies usually feature a femme fatale with much more to her than meets the eye, but Clarissa is one to beat them all. I'll let it stand at that so as not to ruin any of the plot. And Ryan O'Neal rounds out the main cast with a wonderful portrayal of a white-collar criminal.
People accuse me sometimes of taking movies too seriously, but I argue back that my favorites are ones that actually teach me something lasting. As we watch, we solve the mystery along with Daryl Zero, and we learn his methods, similar to reading along to a Sherlock Holmes story (in this case, see ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). While the real world of PI's almost always involves following a spouse around to see if they're cheating, one can still learn from this artificial world of blackmail, murder and reprisal. It is true that 'watching someone in their natural habitat can be very telling,' and learning how to be an objective observer ('the 2 obs') is rewarding. There is one scene where Zero makes his assessment of his client after watching him for a day at the gym, and it is absolutely fantastic.
I read a review of this film that complained about a thin soundtrack. Kasdan himself addressed the question: he hates, as do I, when a soundtrack tells you how to feel. If there's a love scene, play pretty piano music in the background. If someone's being followed, play music in a sinister minor chord. You get the idea. Can't you make a love scene realer, and more poignant, by playing nothing at all, by letting the rustle of a dress as it falls to the floor stand alone as a supremely erotic noise? Kasdan used music minimally, to accentuate a scene rather than make up for it.
Jake Kasdan, in his first solo effort as director, made a film as masterful and quirky as its main character, and at the same time made me hang on to every word while I was stunned time and again at the remarkable plot twists. For that he is to be commended.",1045699200,42,3036,4.481949458483754
35390,3,0780623223,"I like private eye movies but Zero Effect just took too long to get started and Daryll Zero himself (although brilliantly played by Bill Pullman) knows so many stupid things that no one would ever remember for any reason. Check out the scene in the crime scene motel for example.
Ben Stiller is quite watchable too though. But for some reason in every scene with him and his girlfriend they are making out. I don't know if anyone else has noticed this. Tho he's actually got a decent character to get his teeth into this time instead of the 'hapless boyfriend' role he always seems to get stuck with.
""Zero Effect""s main problem is that's it's too talky and almost every scene takes place indoors. This adds an unwanted sense of claustrophobia to the film.
Writer/Director Jake Kasdan does have talent and I would like to see him go far in Hollywood. And perhaps even make a sequel to ""Zero Effect"" but with a bigger budget and a more accessable plotline. It would be a shame to kill of a potentially great franchise because of one rather lame movie.

No small wonder: it appears to be a retelling of the Holmes story ""A Scandal In Bohemia.""  It borrows the skeleton of the original story - which provides us with the comfortable old paradigm - but it veers from the source material enough to make it feel entirely fresh.  Which is cool.
Also, it is interesting from a visual standpoint, which lends credibility to Sherlock's quote (from yet another story) that ""Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms,"" considering Jake Kasdan's paternity.  In this case, it might be better to amend the quote to ""Art in the blood can't help but reveal itself.""  It's a pretty looking film, and the camera is in the hands of someone who understands how to use it as a narrative device.
Even those who haven't read every Sherlock Holmes story available will possibly like this, because I think most people like to watch stories about really, really smart people who figure stuff out . . . particularly when those smart people have a difficult time keeping themselves together, despite their intelligence.
The comparison to Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be quite complete without pointing out that this movie is very sequel-worthy ... and I hope that its makers finally arrive at the same conclusion.",1018310400,13,1406,4.813278008298755

  This movie is about a particular case which he and his ""representative"" Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller) get involved in.
  I felt that this movie was well directed. The opening scene, switching between Arlo describing Daryl Zero to a potential client and describing him to a drinking buddy, is perfect.
  The ""P.I. work"" aspect of this movie is handled well. If you enjoy watching amazing feats of knowlege and deduction you will enjoy this movie. Also very well done, is the comedic aspect. Daryl Zero has some very funny moments, especially when he's narrating the memoir of his investigatory technique, which he is writing. These things take center stage over the actual mystery and surprises.
  Although I am a fan of Ben Stiller his character in this movie was nothing spectacular. It seems, to me, he only shines when he's playing an over-the-top character such as in ""Heavy Weights"" or ""Zoolander"". When he's playing a 'normal' character he can be rather boring in my opinion. Daryl seems to be the only character who has much depth until Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens) enters the picture. Some might think the romance between Daryl and Gloria (whom he investigates) detracted from the movie. Usually I dislike romance in movies, because its shallow and corny. In this movie I actually found it worked well and did not succumb to either of the aforementioned flaws. Perhaps it was because I found the two characters likable and real.

You have your eccentric, but brilliant detective, his trustworthy aide, and a mystery to be solved by logic and reasoning.  It is a well made, and well crafted story, and I would love to see a sequel.
 Bill Pullman, a terrific actor has whose finally managed to lift himself beyond supporting roles and has come into his own as a leading man, is sensational as Daryl Zero.  His methods, observation and objectivity, which he calls the ob's, are similar to those employed by Sherlock Holmes, and have stood the test of time very well.  Ben Stiller is Steve Arlo, Zero's attorney and assistant, who is set up as Zero's Watson, however, he was not chronicle Zero's work for him, so Zero ends up having to do this on his own.  The two work well together, and have a real chemistry, which adds a further dimension to the movie.
 Zero, like Holmes, plays an instrument, a guitar instead of a violin, but he plays badly, while Holmes was a decent violinist.  These differences, I feel, were used, to keep the two of them separate since Zero is in fact, a good detective in his own right, and doesn't really require any further accrutements.  Zero, although a brilliant detective, doesn't interact well with people, and has Arlo meet with all prospective clients, and deal with them exclusively.  His only concern is solving the crime, not with dealing with anything else involved.
 The particular case that we are presented with has to deal with a businessman who has lost his keys, and wants Zero to find out who has them.  Of course, the mystery is much deeper than that; and in the course of the investigation Zero will have to deal with blackmail, a decades old murder, and the most perplexing thing he's ever had to deal with before, love.
 Kim Dickens plays the character Daryl falls in love with for the first time in his life, losing hold of his own cherished objectivity in the process.  Seeing how he deals with this, and how he manages to solve the mystery at the same time, is all part of the fun.
 If I had one complaint to make about the movie, it would be on the length.  The movie runs nearly two hours long, but proabably could have been trimmed by about fifteen minutes or so to make it run a little tighter, but that's only a minor quibble.

Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller both give great performances in this movie; this may be Pullman's finest vehicle to date. However, the movie ultimately fails to live up to the potential of a decent enough screenplay because of the directing. I got the feeling that Kasdan didn't entirely trust the actors nor the audience to ""fill in the blanks"" so rather than letting Zero's quirky character stand on its own, various characters have to say throughout the movie, essentially, ""Zero is quirky,"" over and over again.
There are too many poignant pauses that embarrassingly just hang there, not contributing to character development. Other scenes drag on providing detail that simply doesn't contribute to the overall enjoyment of the movie. I got the feeling that the director was aiming for a ""Buckaroo Banzai"" sort of cult following with audiences dissecting, for example, each line of Zero's love song sung standing on the bed in long underwear and boots.
So if you just want to take the movie lightly and enjoy it, it has too much detail randomly applied. If you want to ""cult out"" on the movie, the detail seems spurious and not integrated.
Surround sound mix was, at the very kindest, uninspired. Other than a few special effects (gun shots) there was a noticeable flatness to the sound stage. A perfect example is when Zero and the girl are out shooting at night: there is a lot of ambient outdoor noise (frogs, crickets, et cetera) but it is all coming out of the front center speaker. It is so easy to expand that out to the corners of the sound stage and thus augment the feeling of being outside at night...",973468800,2,1695,4.71043771043771

First for the bad parts.  It is a new director and it  shows some. There appears to be a change in tone.  The movie starts out  more absurd and then changes as the case gets on.  Secondly there are some  directorial decisions which are questionable such as a long tracking shot  from under a table which has little meaning and detracts.  You also have  the subplot with Arlo and his girlfriend which could have been eliminated.  Films seem to need a whiny woman as a subplot for some reason that I can't  explain.
For the good--you have a hero who lives by cunning and wits with  almost no violence in the movie.  You have a movie with little or no out of  whack plot devices.  The characters act consistently and humanely.  There  is no cold-blooded Clint Eastwood type hero who is more wicked than the  villian.  As Arlo says, there aren't good guys and bad guys, its just a  bunch of guys.  The movie thinks and has a genuine romance by two people  that seems real.  And then for the capper, they stick to their nature and  there isn't a forced ending!  I would hope that there would be another one  but this thing didn't play well in the theaters though everyone I know who  saw it (and I heavily recommended it) liked it alot.

But the talent seems to  run in the family, he is the son of Lawrence Kasdan. Kasdan senior made  'Body Heat', 'The Accidental Tourist' and 'The Big Chill' all great films.  It's basically a very intelligent script filled with sharp dialogue and a  twisting plot brought to life by an extremely likable cast. Bill Pullman  was an odd choice but he makes a compelling Darryl Zero. Pullman has made  some good films in his limited career, namely a small part in 'The Last  Seduction' which is his best performance yet, but is an actor of limited  range. As likable as he may be, one can't help but imagine a more versatile  actor in that crucial role. Ben Stiller on the other hand is perfectly cast  as Steve Arlo, Zero's sidekick and representative. The plot itself has more  twists than a pretzel but it's surprisingly not hard to follow and it's  very involving which heightens the suspense. Ryan O'Neal who will always be  remembered for his role in 'Love Story' makes for a compelling unlikable  character. The basic premise of the script which deals with Zero's  smoothness on the job but social ineptitude in real life is very well  handled until he meats the blackmailer herself (Kim Dickens) and becomes  romantically involved with her.

I want to share this story with a blind friend  and I believe he would enjoy it best if he had it on cassette in book form.  Please Help.",953078400,,307,3.8412698412698414

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, although it got a little slow in one or two parts.  Bill Pullman gave an excellent performance.",952128000,,262,4.3061224489795915
35428,5,0780623223,"I have seen this movie a few times and it keeps getting better.  The beginning is a little slow but once I got drawn in by the quirky Darryl Zero (played brilliantly by Bill Pullman) and his sidekick Steve Arlo (a  great performance by Ben Stiller), I couldn't wait to see what happened  next. This movie has a lot of funny lines, some suspense and a compelling  love scene. I hope there is a sequel.",951436800,,400,4.293333333333333

It's plot twists is reminiscient of L.A.  Confidential.  The comedy and love story also enhance the movie.",944784000,,278,4.829787234042553

Zero is an ace detective, no the world's greatest, and it shows in the plot, but he is  also very quirky! It's excellent! You must see this movie!",937612800,2,280,4.0

The DVD has director commentary by the first time movie director.  It shows  from the performances he gets out of his actors that the director is an old  hand at play direction.

35433,1,0780623223,"This film has got to win a prize as one of the most pretentious pieces of garbage ever made.  The characters have been designed to plug in to the audience's expectations without any actual attempt at giving them depth.  The entire film consists of a series of phony plot points designed to allow  the characters to exhibit ridiculous behavior that is supposed to be hip  and sophisticated.  As a result this film exists as a superficial piece of  junk, as obviously the director was too frightened to create any real  dramatic tension using emotion and logic, instead relying on stylistic  posturing and hollow dialogue.

7789791,5,0780623223,I am curious why this movie is not in blu ray yet.  It is an understated masterpiece of quirk that grabs you at moments with astonishing intensity.  Bill Pullman's character is unnervingly realized and brilliant.  Perhaps we just need things to be big and loud instead of nuanced and authentic.

7789794,5,0780623223,"I loved everything about this. I'm surprised it isn't more well-known. It's funny, gripping, and moving. Pullman is amazing. It does well several things that other films attempt without success. It's a mystery story with a plot that can be followed, in contrast to so many where the plot is incomprehensible, or missing (The Big Sleep being a typical example). It has plot twists, but they don't leave you feeling cheated, like the narrator was purposely misleading you.

Wishing now I'd purchased instead of rented this. Amazon should add a re-up option, to buy after renting, discounted by the rental fee.",1503187200,,607,5.00990099009901

Also  this would probably appeal to fans of the  ""Monk"" TV series because it's a very similar plot frame. The love scenes are cheesy, the charachters are shticky, but it works and like I said if you enjoy a high-quality but very 89s / 90s Hollywood assembly line movie, this is one of the best. With all those disclaimers it's worth adding that although much of this is fairly paint- by-numbers The outcome is legitimately hard to predict and there is an underlying theme about not judging a book by its cover that takes this just a notch beyond the level of mere entertainment.",1501632000,,711,4.5390625
