1867,2,0310275288,"I bought this DVD to replace the one I had before (and which was lost in a church library), about 8-10 years ago.  The older version had a chapter that corresponded with each chapter in the book, but this revised version had condensed DVD chapters that grouped book chapters, which made it much less useful for my purpose, which was to support a chapter-by-chapter discussion of the book.",1256083200,9,388,4.705882352941177

7787929,5,0310275288,Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use. Thank you very much. I am using this book to teach a Bible study and everyone is loving it.,1408924800,,196,3.8048780487804876
7787930,5,0310275288,"The video clips are interspersed with commentary from Yancey and opportunities for group discussion and examination of appropriate passages of Scripture. As an ELCA Lutheran pastor, I don't really need as much of the ""de-fundamentalizing"" as the author seemed to, but the perspective is very good for the class members.",1376352000,2,319,5.4
7787931,4,0310275288,Our group has really been enjoying this study.  We have seen clips from movies about Jesus that we did not know existed.  Some are fun some are strange and then Phiip adds his commentary on them all.  Combined with the participants guide we have had great discussions.,1363046400,,268,4.659574468085107
7787932,5,0310275288,"This bk is really interesting and informative about Jesus, as a Jewish man, and things he had to go thru, because of this.  We did a bible study with this bk, and we all came away feeling closer to Jesus and knowing Him better!",1360540800,,227,4.159090909090909
7787933,5,0310275288,"I got this preparing to preach a series on Christ.  Turns out our church is starting three new small groups using this as one of many studies that will happen thus year.

The church in America gets so far off base trying to turn Jesus into an American, Anglo Savior.  It was refreshing to learn about Jesus from the context of a first century Israeli.  The gospel makes much more sense with that starting point.

Thanks Phillip Yancey for a well written book that I had to share with friends.",1356912000,2,492,4.4222222222222225
7787934,4,0310275288,I purchased this item to refresh my memory of it in anticipation of using it in our adult Christian Formation program.  It is as good as I recalled and we will be using in in the coming year.  It is in good condition and was received on time.,1346803200,,242,4.020833333333333
7787935,3,0310275288,"The book and accompanying bible study lesson book are awesome.  However, the dvd is not as powerful because there is use of several movies that are ""unusual"".  One has a blonde Jesus and one has Johnny Cash.  We couldn't get past the strange video segments, which is unfortunate because the book is life changing!",1325116800,,313,4.7592592592592595
7787936,5,0310275288,I've loved using this with my Sunday School class (college age) and they're enjoying it as well.,1269216000,4,96,4.705882352941177
