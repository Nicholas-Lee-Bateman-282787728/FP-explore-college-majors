Threr were no competable enemy Fighters in korean Sky.
After active invovmennt of Chinese Communist Army,
On 1,Nov,1950,a flighting formations of F-51 Mustang
near the Yalu River, 6 shinny,fast flying airplanes
approached to F-51S.which were swept winged Jet fighters.
later they knew as the MiG-15s. It was 1st appearing MiG-15
in Korean Air. 7 days later on 8,Nov,1950,flight wing of F-80C
Shooting Star's were engaged by 6 MIG-15 near the Yalu River.
Among spreading F-8OC,lT.Brown chase down to a MiG-15,He bursted
6X12.7mm machine guns and smoe trailing MiG-15 fell down to the
ground. That was 1st Jet-vs-Jet AIR Combat of the world, and 1st
jet Kill !.MiG-15 seems lighter agile,faster,better manuverd,tight
turnable,better rate of climb,high altitued,heavier armamented
Russian Jet Fighters. There after Straight winged, obsolute fighters
such as F-80C, F-84G,F9F,and Metere F.8 were released from fighting
with MiG-15s. Immediately most believable,recent, swept-winged F-86A
Sabre was introduced for combat with MiG-15.
F-86A has faster dive speed,better maneuverbility in low altitude,
but armamament does not match with MiG-15(1X37mm cannon, 2X23mm cannon)
F-86 series has all 6X12.7mm machine guns. Better trained pilot and
good gunsight becme favourable tofighting with MiG-15S.
 F-86E and F-86F cames with better Air Powers than MiG-15S IN Combat.
Because MiG-15 desined and heay armoured attacking B-29 like slow, heavy
bombers. B-29 had many loss by Attacking MiG-15.
Russian piloted Mig-15 just fight thieir favourable ""MiG ALLEY"" for
 keeping secret of invovment of Russian Pilots in Korean War !",1243900800,,1664,5.732793522267206
