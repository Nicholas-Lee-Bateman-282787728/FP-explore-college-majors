8363862,5,B002CBZ3UC,"I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD. The producers did an excellent job of capturing the adventures associated with producing an exciting and exceptionally funny fishing video. The film has fast cars, pretty women, trout, salmon, sharks, and plenty of heartwarming moments. The soundtrack took a little getting used to but definitely did not detract from a unique movie that even non-fishermen can enjoy.",1351036800,,397,5.419354838709677
