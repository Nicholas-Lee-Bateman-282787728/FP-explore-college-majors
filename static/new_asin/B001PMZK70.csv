8333845,5,B001PMZK70,"That's Swan Lake you're looking at on the cover for this DVD of Stars of the Russian Ballet. This is volume two, or 2 TOM as the Russians have it labelled. All the wording on this DVD is in the Russian language except on the disc itself which is entitled Stars of the Russian Ballet in English. You will have to buy the DVD to get the information I am going to give here free. All you have to do is read it. The DVDs are packeged and labeled as volumes 1&2. When you get the DVDs they are broken down into volumes 1&2 and 3&4. Volume 2 is really volumes 3&4. Confused? Don't worry about it just buy them BOTH and enjoy.

The information below is only available from the chapters menu on the individual DVDs. I will give you the chapter numbers, the name of the ballet, the date they were filmed, the music composer, and the dancers.

One hundred and twenty nine minutes of fabulous dancing by some of the worlds greatest Dancers. Of course, Baryshnikov didn't become great until he defected to the West, did he? Ask the Russians if THEY think he is great. Seriously though, these DVDs, Stars of the Russian ballet, Volumes one and two, are very good additions to your collection. They are not the best in sound, color or definition, but they are acceptable. They are claiming Dolby D stereo, but I'm wondering. The sound level on both discs is very loud, so be ready to turn it down.

I liked both of these DVDs.......Richard.",1262736000,9,2908,5.204301075268817
