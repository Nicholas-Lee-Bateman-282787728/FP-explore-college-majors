2892121,1,B000T28PHY,"The narrative attempts to give one the idea the Jews were not in bondage, they simple walked out as a military force completely glossing over the impact of the plagues sent by God via Moses.  If you are a Jew or Christian who believes in God you will find this narrative slightly offensive.  Once again, humanistic academia tries to rewrite history and the bible... give them enough time and the Jews will be written right out of history.  They take one word, they left with ""boldness"" to build a whole story around one word... amazing, while ignoring other scripture that clearly says they are in bondage!  And crossing of the Red Sea once again, the winds just blew a path since it was so shallow , yet the same shallow water seemed to destroy the Egyptian army.  You will pick up on the subtle anti-God themes throughout!  Its funny, they have been trying to prove the Bible wrong for over 1500 year and they still can not!!  I also love how they make David look like a man and the Giant look like a semi-large man and show how easily it was to defeat him (again taking God out of the equation).  It clearly says he was a boy (not a soldier - took care of sheep).  No other hardened soldier stepped forward to fight, yet a boy defeated him with Gods help.

Trust me it will not be long and they will be saying the Jews were never killed in WWII and Christ never walked the earth!  I was hoping for a military tactics, instead at every turn they take and try to destoy credibility of real events.  The Title should be how Humanstic Academia can use a military theme to further support thier obvious lack of faith in the Bible.

They really could have just talked tactics and if they want to make a point pertaining to God at least give both viewpoints , and say "" which ever you believe"" then continue, but instead their strong bias comes out very clear!",1291420800,4,1856,4.3604651162790695
2892122,3,B000T28PHY,"I love military history, as well as Biblical history, so I thought this would be a good merger of the 2. It is a well researched program, as well as being excellently re-enacted in it's live scenes. My problem with it is that NO credit is given to The Lord for what occured during these battles..........NONE !!!!!!!!!! The Bible is explicit,in some of these accounts,in that God brought the Isrealites victory ( or defeat ), due to their faith in Him and their devotion to Him. None of that is covered in this show ; it suggests that all these conflicts were won solely by the Isreali comanders involved ( i.e. Moses, Joshua, Saul and David ),and their troops. God gave these men the knowledge,ability and courage to triumph in these struggles,as well as adding the weight of nature to the fight in favor of the Hebrews. Anyone who believes in the Bible believes in that ( or should ). It's astonishing that any program discussing the Bible would omit any reference to God's part in these events : in fact, at one point, one of the military historians who are adding their personal insight to the narration, actually questions God's existence,period !!!!!!!! Strange words for a Biblical show, I must say. Thank you, and may The Lord guide and bless your life.",1261180800,11,1261,4.6591928251121075
2892123,5,B000T28PHY,I am very impressed at how this documentary was produced and only wish that it was longer! The re-enactment scenes are violent and real! The program is fast moving and very exciting! It's like watching an adventure movie and you learn a great deal at the same time! I highly suggest this documentary for anyone interested in Ancient warfare or Biblical studies!!!,1245974400,9,363,4.870967741935484

2892125,3,B000T28PHY,"""Bible Battles"" seems to be an historical exercise that not only rewrites and makes sense of the Bibles version of history but also wishes to glorify the murdering exploits of the Israelites. This video chronicles history from a number of different sources in an attempt to make sense of the Bible. The Israelites begin their crime spree by ransacking a town and make their escape from Egypt after frustration at being given common labor jobs. The new calling for the Israelites is having their own country which ""GOD"" has told them is their country. This has apparently given them the permission to murder and ransack anyone and anything for that purpose in the ancient land that is now Israel. This video details how the Israelites attack the peaceful, walled community of Jericho and murder every man, woman, child and animal.  It is quite graphic in its depictions but what I take exception to is that how these military historians glorify the Israelites actions as being ""Professional"" and is a ""Victory"" for them. Viewing complete annihilation and slaughter in any way as positive suggests support for such activity and could suggest that they would be supportive of any annihilation such  as was done by the Germans (Hitler) or as what we have seen in Africa. So, for this reason I consider this work to be morally shallow but it does provide much detail that, for someone who is not morally offended by a tweaking of the Bible's version of history, can help one make sense of the past. I have had to write my review here because the History channel doesn't offer direct comments on their DVD's rather just a forum.",1229817600,8,1622,4.789285714285715
2892126,3,B000T28PHY,"Be aware right off that nearly all of the commentators in this episode are of the opinion that many of the most famous Old Testament stories are wrong, if not outright frauds, and that some of the Bible stories make no sense ""from a military perspective"". In particular, Moses is painted not as a religious leader relying on God to free his people, but as a shrewd military commander that out-maneuvers and out-fights Pharaohs army. Using their reasoning, however, in 5,000 years will similar military experts contend that Martin Luther King Jr. could only have been a military commander, that it could be the only explanation for his success in leading his people across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Montgomery? The line of thought is very similar from the experts here on the Exodus.

The only reason this review gets three stars is because of the excellent analysis of the Hebrew-Canaanaite-Philistine battles. The Exodus stuff seemed like so much speculation, especially about the ""maneuver"" through the Reed Sea.",1206230400,18,1016,5.0476190476190474
2892127,4,B000T28PHY,"I origionally saw this on the history channel and decided I wanted to be able to review it whenever I wanted.  It takes a non religious view of the Bible as a military history text and discusses several events from the Old Testament in that context.  As much as it looks into that aspect of the Bible as history, it also points out that the Bible describes in detail some very unpleasent aspects of history in that period, and apparently without shrinking from the ugly details.",1206230400,14,478,4.546511627906977
2892128,5,B000T28PHY,I suggest this for anyone who is interested in the Old Testament or Torah for study. This video is very detailed and in chronological order.

2892129,5,B000T28PHY,"If you are studying the Old Testament of the Bible, this History Channel program gives a unique perspective of events of the time, told from the point of view of the soldier.

This program provides a humanistic opinion of Old Testament events that involved warfare as told in a very logical sequencing of military thought and strategy.

2892136,5,B000T28PHY,"An amazing look at stories that you probably have heard of as a child in Sunday school or just reading the Bible. The film puts a new spin on some very old battles. Looked at from the perspective of military strategy, the stories of Moses, Saul, and others as they fight to gain their freedom and establish statehood is refreshing. Moses as warrior, pillars of fire that are not necessarily from God; the walls of Jericho fall down with spies and maybe not so much trumpets in the literal sense....all of these stories are shown to be sources of military strategy in themselves at the time AND later in world history. This approach is somewhat controversial in that it sees the battles of the Bible as metaphors for real strategies. It also shows the early warriors of the Bible to be as blood thirsty as their enemies, and just as calculating. It is a History Channel episode well worth buying and watching...with an open mind. And you'll want to watch it again and again to get the details.",1414195200,2,992,4.578651685393258
2892137,2,B000T28PHY,"I like the concept of showing the Bible battles from a military perspective.  I found it fascinating.  But it failed in regards to their religious beliefs.  You simply can't look at these things from a purely human perspective when in reality, these people depended on and were motivated by God.  It caused us to not have a complete look at history and made it clear that they don't trust in the sufficiency of scripture while picking and choosing what they want to show and what they don't.  That's a horrible thing to do from a historian's perspective.",1405728000,2,554,4.670103092783505

2892139,5,B000T28PHY,"This 90-minute History Channel documentary (ignore the dust jacket that says it is 100 minutes) from 2005 is a fun and fast-moving analysis of military battles in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, starting with Abraham's rescue of his nephew Lot and continuing through the military exploits of figures like Moses and the judge Deborah. Unlike many older History Channel videos deceptively packaged under recent copyrights in the same style of artwork, this is actually a modern (i.e. within the past ten years) production that features excellent CGI animations and rousing battle recreations. This video is no stale 1990s documentary with still art photography and pompous voiceovers, like many older History Channel or A&E biblical documentaries, but is a slickly produced ""infotainment"" tour of the Bible in the more current History Channel style.

The film's details about weapons and tactics are a bit excessive, and the Vietnam veteran-professor who provides most of the analysis seems just slightly on the crackpot side, but it's fascinating to see the Biblical battles presented in a way that presumes the reliability of scripture as a historical text. While one wishes for a bit more stuff on the archaeological record of these events, the documentary offers the intriguing hypothesis that the Bible is a treasure trove of accurate military history replete with rich information about ancient battle tactics, and it does so in an entertaining way. The film is just a touch bloody, but it's not excessive, and it's not boring at all. It's certainly modern enough to hold the attention of young people today, with appealing graphics and visuals that catch the eye. I would recommend it for religion students both young and old, but also for military history buffs who enjoy learning about ancient military culture. ""Bible Battles"" is not very deep, but it's fun, and it is respectful of the religious texts without trying to deconstruct them.",1394409600,8,1949,5.1873015873015875

It covers major battles in the OT, giving background history and results of each battle and what it meant historically to Jews and Christians.  Most of all, it shows strategies of battle that were of God and how His leading led to their successes.  These strategies have been used successfully in modern battles as well.

And then 40 years later, when they let their true intention be known throughout the land, with their act of, ""Genocide"", to all foregn inhabitents in the region, who got in their way, created this trend of terror, fear and horror, which has been carried forward through history....But not the ""remembering"" of the events to the horrors of ""Genocide"", but allowing the perpetuation of the ""hate"" of the event, which has created this stigma towards them (the Jews) allowing a retaliation from the past to be metered out throughout time all the way to the present...I believe, in the early history of man, this great event, ""Genocide"", which had never happened before with such an intensity, caused a great awe, and fear, that had never been relized before to the people of the land who lived throughout the region and beyond, created this pursuant for ""revenge"" for these thousands of years against the Jews....The world never forgave this firt true act of ""Genocide""....",1373846400,,1537,5.05511811023622
2892145,5,B000T28PHY,very informative. Well researched. I have no hesitation recommending it. You will not want to stop watching this documentary once you start watching it.,1364169600,,152,5.375
2892146,4,B000T28PHY,"This series claims to analyze bible battles.  After viewing the film, it follows through on what it claims.  Like many shows, books or commentaries on the bible, you have to take what are the golden nuggets and leave the rest.  For instance, if a new Christian or weaker Christian, like all Christians were at one time, viewed this show, they might dismiss it for being anti-Christian.  To be honest the history channel like many media and academic resources never claim to be Christian nor would I expect them to treat such matters with honesty or balance.

  I watched the film knowing that it would probably be biased or at least ignore the supernatural aspects of the bible as it touched on the topic they were discussing.  It seemed allot like the atheist Asimov's commentary on the bible.  He gives little insight into the bible except to dismiss the supernatural events of the bible by theories more outrageous than just accepting the original claims of the bible.

  However, this series is absolutely insightful when it comes to how certain events or battles mentioned in the bible might have been carried out.  The bible doesn't give the details on many of the events because the writers are inspired by God to write with a certain topic or subject matter.  The subject matters in the bible primarily points readers to God's eventual coming to earth.  If God gave a detailed account of every event the bible would be indigestible and impossible to get through.  Historians would have loved it but the average person could have cared less.

  The point is that this history channel production about the bible is far better than most secular productions about the bible.  Their typical approach to supernatural events is typical and expected but their insight to the details of the battles through historical, archeological and cultures norms is actually pretty good but not as good as it could be.  Having studied a great many background and cultural commentaries on the near east, especially as it pertains to the bible, they have left out the influential impact the different nations religions and deities played in the battles or people groups of the ancient near east.  Admittedly, God worked out supernatural events in real time with real people.

  These supernatural events would have had connection to the very reality that the Jews lived in.  For example, it is very possible that God used the pillar of fire which may have been a common theme used in the Egyptian army for various military reason.  However, god uses common symbols between the Egyptians and Jews to point to a new history and reinterpretation of those once pagan symbols.  Instead of a smoking flame in front of the Egyptian army for various reasons, God puts a self moving pillar of fire to block the Egyptians by itself and lead the Jewish on its own.  Essentially God is saying that what the Egyptians understood the flaming fire to be, as it pertains to the Egyptian army, is now reinterpreted as it pertains to the new unfolding history of the Jewish people who could see the symbolic and historic ramifications.  Lastly, this film could have been better if it would have just stayed within its boundaries and resisted the temptation to comment on events left better to the Theologian or balanced Historians.",1359936000,2,3299,4.860215053763441
2892147,4,B000T28PHY,"Fantastic Information. One of the things that really sticks out in this documentary is the obvious lack of God in any part. What I found equally interesting was the presence of a Menorah in the background as the narrator spoke. He was obviously giving honor to God by having it in plain sight. I feel like his being able to tell this story was prpbably based on his willingness to leave God out...and yet he found a way to bring Him into the equation, however subtle that may be. Very shred.

I found this video to be extremely informative about the history of the ancient world and it's warfare. The 2 things I did not agree with were 1. The assumptions that were made that were in total opposition to the Bible (the Jews were not in bondage...etc.). This is called Bible Battles, isn't it? and 2. The total lack of God's guidance in the movements of the leaders. They Israelites won, not because of their own intelligence, but because of their dependence on God and His leadership.

There is a lot of information that is misleading about the Bible on the internet as people speculate. This is one of those great examples of great information but keep your Bible handy. This is a reference tool, but not the ultimate authority.

I have watched this series many, many times and find it very relevant to my studies as a Christian and would think it would be equally interesting to the Jewish People. I don't accept the absence of God, but do accept the military strategy God gave his people to conquer Canaan.",1339632000,9,1508,4.536764705882353

2892149,4,B000T28PHY,"This show is extremely well done. It is interesting and entertaining, with no moments that drag or make one lose interest. The narration, the comments, the cinematography, and the quality of the re-enactments are all first class.

Richard Gabriel, the author whose book, ""Military History of Ancient Israel""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Military-History-of-Ancient-Israel/dp/0275977986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Military History of Ancient Israel</a>, is the foundation of this show is the main narrator. As he explains, he is examining the Bible and the battles from the perspective of a soldier who has been in battle, who has felt the sweat, fear, blood, and pain, and also as military historian. As an expert in that field, he can read between the lines in a manner that few can match. Simultaneously, he points out that the Hebrew word used in the Bible as written to describe the Jewish people in Egypt as ""slaves"" has been mistranslated, and should be translated as workers. This is not the only mistranslation in the Bible. The 6th Commandment, thou shall not kill, actually must state, when translated correctly, thou shall not murder. If it actually said thou shall not kill, then Joshua, etc, would never have fought to conquer Canaan, and there is no indication that God was going to do all of the fighting for them, and they would have wandered in the wilderness forever.

It would be good if all Christians would take the current translations of the Bible and what they state with a grain of salt. Just becuase it has been drummed into all of us since Sunday school days does not make it correct.

Gabriel does not explain how God is assisting in any way. He is approaching it from the purely military analysis. I know from my own studies how easy it is, if one does not know a subject intimately, to overlook or misunderstand a writing or statement. I also know, for those subjects I do know, how easy it is for everyone else to overlook or misunderstand what is written, stated, or occurring. Every Christian can decide for themself exactly how God interacted in each battle with each leader.

This military analysis makes a great deal of sense. How slaves could have escaped from Ramses II and his army has always been a stretch, even with Charlton Heston parting the sea.

Nothing that is in this show is anti-Christian, or should diminish ones Christian beliefs. If anything, it should enhance them, for God, in His Wisdom, chose a people that could survive.

I do recommend this show. At the very least, it is a great thought starter. More likely, it is a revelation that makes great sense as well as being time well spent.",1301875200,,2698,4.997772828507795
