8340512,5,B001T4Y1GA,We just retured from the Canadian Rockies.  This video was an excellent preview of what we would experience on the trip.  We also used it on the second day of the trip to benefit our two guests who had joined us from California.  It proved to be a very useful way to get the most from our trip.  It covered almost all of the features that we chose to enjoy while there.  We recommend it to others.,1284768000,3,397,4.103896103896104
8340513,5,B001T4Y1GA,"We are planning a trip to the rockies and needed a first hand look at them. Looked at some travel books but too much information and not enough pictures. Some information is great but was over loaded. Sat down with the Wife and started watching. Was a great way to view where we are planning on going and seeing.
We would recommend this dvd for any one wanting to see and or planning on going to see the rockies.
