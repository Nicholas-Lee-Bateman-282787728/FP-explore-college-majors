8506652,5,B006YWICQ2,"John Martyn is/was one of the greatest singer, songwriter, guitarists of all time.  This DVD is a beautiful sampling of his music.  If you have never heard of John Martyn before, you are in for a treat.  Also, no CD collection is complete without his Solid Air and One World albums.  This man is a true genius.",1522886400,,310,4.385964912280702

8506654,5,B006YWICQ2,"The editing isn't great, the sound quality is so-so (stereo only), the video to DVD transfer is a bit grainy and the DVD pauses here and there! Add that all together and this compilation still gets 5 stars!!! It's John Martyn at his best. This is a re-edited DVD based on a 2001 VHS issue but the folks who put this together added new material and the music selection just plain works!

The titles are actually taken from mutiple concerts held in Scotland and Ireland between 1999 and 2003 so the flow can be a bit choppy. Don't sweat it! Sit back, open a bottle of your favorite brew and simply enjoy! This is a ""must have"" for John's fans.

The producers of this DVD need to release the music from this DVD in a CD format, it's that good!",1340236800,9,740,4.2785714285714285
8506655,5,B006YWICQ2,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom.  She said the concert is fabulous and well worth watching again and again.,1294963200,2,120,4.217391304347826
