8573427,3,B00BSXGJK8,"Nice for treadmill walks, prefer my own music as I always do with these. The resolution could be a lot better, shame they're not offered in Blu Ray like the Bike O Vision series are. That makes quite a difference in enjoyability when you're standing right in front of a large Hi Def screen. You need quite a few of these to combat midwestern winters on treadmills and bikes so until something better comes available I'll buy more.",1396483200,4,430,4.5256410256410255
