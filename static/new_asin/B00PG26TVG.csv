6798337,5,B00PG26TVG,"Loved it!  It is a great compliment to my Zumba collection.  It's a good work out that is challenging and fun. You enjoy the exercise aspect, yet feel like you ate dancing!  The instructor is wonderful.",1463961600,,202,4.555555555555555
6798338,2,B00PG26TVG,"I have many other Weight Watchers exercise videos, and what I like about them is that they are specifically geared towards people who are out of shape, not coordinated, and older (40+) However, this video is nothing like that.  All of the background dancers are young 20-something fitness models, which was the first warning sign that this would not be suitable for me.  The routines were difficult to follow because there was absolutely no cueing.  The instructor would just change steps without counting down, and I would always be 1-2 steps behind.  And many of the moves are not safe for anyone who is overweight or out of shape - lots of jerking, twisting, lunging, etc.  I am going to stick to my other Weight Watchers videos, along with Leslie Sansone.  I'll give this two stars instead of one though, because if you are young and/or already in shape, and with a dance background, you might like this.  However, anyone who fits that description probably isn't going to buy Weight Watchers products.",1462492800,21,1005,4.808139534883721
6798339,5,B00PG26TVG,"Just what I have been waiting for, a dance workout!!  Couldn't wait to have this delivered!!  I watched the first part, and couldn't wait to get moving!!  I have Fibromyalgia and refused to take medication, this was perfect for me!!  Got me moving and feeling so good about myself!!  Highly recommend it!!",1461024000,12,305,4.788461538461538

6798351,5,B00PG26TVG,Daughter uses it and enjoys it.,1459123200,,31,4.333333333333333
6798352,5,B00PG26TVG,"I was skeptical of this at first, but the workouts are really, REALLY fun (like ""down nine pounds in one month from doing this"" fun!)The instructor is great, and once you get used to the moves, your confidence goes through the roof!  The sticks were the only bad part of the deal.  They leaked when I started using them, sending black particles all over my den.  However, with a little hockey wrap, that is no longer a problem.  In all, I love this video, and I would love for Weight Watchers to come up with some more products like this.",1459123200,5,538,4.35
6798353,1,B00PG26TVG,the camera kept moving around and in and out until it made me VERY dizzy. I threw it away the first time I saw it ... didn't even exercise with it. I can't believe it got a 5 star rating!!!!,1458345600,9,190,3.775

6798373,5,B00PG26TVG,I attend Weight Watchers and these DVD's and fitness gear items are great and keep me motivated.  I've said good-bye to 130 pounds thus far!!,1433980800,3,141,4.64
6798374,2,B00PG26TVG,Routines are not as interesting as I had hoped,1432598400,,46,4.222222222222222
6798375,5,B00PG26TVG,"I love the Weight Watchers workout. I am not an active person. I absolutly have no rhythm. This video doesn't care. I feel like I can do all the moves, the video has a teaching part that is slower so you know what to do once you start. Ones session and I'm in a sweat! Woo Hoo!",1432166400,,277,3.8771929824561404
6798376,2,B00PG26TVG,"Now for the positive...such as it is...I like the instructor and the music is a cut above the usual fare.  I've only done the beginner workout and the tutorial.  Basically I'm giving this workout 2 stars because the movements go from slow to frenetic with little to no time to adjust.  And then there's the add on...and add on...and add on. And so on and so forth.  Definitely not an easy go for the older crowd.  Adding to this is the awkward camera angles at times which makes following the moves even more challenging.  This was my first go at doing this workout and my attempts are bound to improve with practice.  I didn't expect to execute every movement perfectly ( or even fairly well) initially but I did at least expect to be able to keep up doing some form of the movement.  After all this routine is supposed to be directed to the beginner and it's  a weight watcher geared product to boot...and I do not believe it serves it's targeted audience in either of those respects.  I'll continue practicing the ""beginner"" routine despite my frustration as I spent almost $40. on this kit.  But if you're older (like me) allow me to reccommend Zumba Gold Toning and to save your money on this as Zumba Gold is a really good doable routine that you can follow and still feel like you've had an excellent, fun workout. This will be an expensive, unnecessary, supplement to that. I'd return this quite honestly but I've opened it and used the toning sticks.  If you're really overweight or sedentary...pass on this one.",1430524800,7,1521,4.571955719557195
6798377,4,B00PG26TVG,The WW discs are easy to follow this one is no exception.,1429315200,2,57,3.8333333333333335
6798378,5,B00PG26TVG,"This is a great DVD to get you moving.  The three different routines are similar enough that you can keep up with the steps, but different enough that you won't get bored.  The firming sticks give you a better workout and honestly, make the whole thing a lot more fun!",1428710400,5,268,4.34
6798379,5,B00PG26TVG,Great way to have fun and exercise too.,1426723200,3,39,4.0
6798380,5,B00PG26TVG,"I am 62 years ""young"" have been dancing my whole life and even though I am a senior now, this was very doable for me.  The instructor is very sweet and motivating and knowledgeable ~ very good cuing, If any of you senior women out there want a fun, cardio routine that keeps you low impact, but a good workout this is the one for you!!!  Standing Cool down section after each cardio routine is very relaxing and efficient!",1425600000,4,422,4.329113924050633

8687745,5,B00PG26TVG,Glad I bought it. Working on getting the steps down to a science. For the money it is worth a try to be active if you cannot get out during the day.,1518652800,,148,3.65625
8687746,5,B00PG26TVG,"I own several weight watcher dvd's and this is my favorite. It's fun and easy to follow, unike other dance dvds I've tried. I like the three workout choices so you can choose what fits your time schedule. The coupons are expired but I didn't care--the product was a good value on its own. I'm very happy with this purchase!",1517616000,,323,4.4

8687748,5,B00PG26TVG,I have only tried one of the work outs but I really enjoy it. It is fast but after a few workout I was able to get the steps right. I have another weight watchers video with the bands that I like but wanted to add more to my workout routine.,1515888000,,241,3.7450980392156863
8687749,5,B00PG26TVG,"I really enjoyed this tape.  I am dance challenged and I was able to do this.  It is upbeat and keeps you moving the whole time.  The instructor was good, not annoying by talking a lot, just kept you moving.",1503187200,,207,4.125
