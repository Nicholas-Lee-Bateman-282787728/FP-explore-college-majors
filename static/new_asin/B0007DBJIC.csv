8047075,2,B0007DBJIC,"A fresh alumnus arrives to conquer Hollywood-and does it!

More hints on sex than actually shown while more boy-talks than character's interest in females but pleasing an influential one on her command, made this story a bit more realistic, probably.

Beautiful actors add some visual pleasure to this fairytale-family-viewing to inspire school graduates.",1288483200,,355,5.679245283018868
8047076,1,B0007DBJIC,"Granted I only bought this movie because I was a background actress in it and although it was a kick to see me several times throughout the film, this movie was boring, not funny and a waste of time. The directing sucked, the cinematography sucked, the screenplay sucked - it all sucked!",1212192000,,287,4.538461538461538
8047077,3,B0007DBJIC,"If you have not seen the film and are looking at the generally positive (if limited in number and possibly associated with the production) comments about ""New Suit"", you must be puzzled about why this independent film was not picked up for theatrical release.

A movie about a struggling screenwriter in Hollywood who sells a screenplay without having a real script! Sounds like ""The Big Picture"" and ""Office Space"" (but trust me - ""New Suit is not nearly as funny). Also sounds like another of those situations where an actual screenwriter had so little real life experience that the only thing he could write about is the movie business.

So they take an old concept from ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ""As Young as You Feel"", or ""Being There"" and change the setting to Hollywood; partly because it's the only world they know anything about, partly because it lends itself to super cheap production design, and partly because those in ""the business"" are subject to a conceit that those outside the business are just dying to see a detailed examination of Hollywood workplace dynamics. Kevin Taylor (Jordan Bridges), an aspiring screenwriter by night and a lowly assistant to a producer (Dan Hedaya in a good supporting performance) by day, invents a writer named Jordan Strawberry (a Baskin Robbins employee and the flavor Keith orders) and an unseen script titled ""New Suit"". His agent and sometimes girlfriend (Marisa Coughlan) cleverly parlays it into something everyone must have, with producers bidding millions for the rights to produce it. You have to suspend disbelief a little here but Coughlan's manipulations are pretty convincing.

Now if this is starting to sound like something with extremely limited viewer appeal I haven't mentioned the worst part. Just as things are getting fun and you begin to identify with the two schemers, Kevin changes his mind and confesses rather than take advantage of the situation. So instead of being able to get off on the situation and have some vicarious glee, the viewer is subjected to an extremely tired lecture on morality and personal integrity (as if anyone actually believed this story was anything more than a satirical fantasy). And they wonder why these things lose money.

A word about Marisa Coughlan, this is the third of her films I have seen (""Pumpkin"" and ""Teaching Mrs Tingle"" were the others). All three were lousy films made watchable by her performances-""New Suit"" was the best if only because it was her biggest part. Coughlan strikes me as a actress who brings 200% to the set each day and whose performance must be restrained by the director rather than motivated-a problem that directors wish they had to deal with all the time. Hopefully she will get work in some decent ventures soon because she more than deserving.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1150934400,2,2838,4.941299790356394
8047078,5,B0007DBJIC,"Oh my Gawwwd! A SCATHINGLY BRILLIANT take on Hollywood or, indeed, any industry where BS rules. That butt-naked Emperor just has to parade every place he goes!",1140825600,,159,4.925925925925926
8047079,5,B0007DBJIC,"""New Suit"" takes an old idea and sets it on its ear.  Then it stomps on it!

While most of the cast is comprised of lesser-known actors, not one performance from any actor is less than first rate.  The script is witty and clever, without ever taking itself too seriously (something too easily and too frequently done) and comes off smart without being petty or bitter.  Everybody wins here - at least they think they do (we, and Kevin Taylor know better!)

More than just that, everyone involved in this project seems to be having the time of their lives.

As Kevin Taylor, Beau Bridges' strikes just the right balance between idealistic young screenwriter and jaded, seen-and-heard-it-all weary office drone.  A simple lunch break prank to teach a lesson to some know-it-all sycophant co-workers spins horribly out of control developing a life of its own and takes Tinseltown by storm.  The ensuing chaos, desperation and Kevin's attempts to rectify the situation will result in varying laugh levels from chuckling out loud, to all out thigh slapping hysteria.

What a gem of a movie.",1111536000,10,1085,4.885245901639344
8047080,5,B0007DBJIC,"This film is a modern-day spin on ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", and it is extremely well-written & well-done.  It is smart, biting, relentless, and funny.  This is the movie that ""The Player"" was trying to be... but this movie is actually effective at breaking through to the audience, while ""The Player"" alienated itself from its audience by using too many ""inside jokes"".  I was lucky enough to catch this fantastic movie while it was in limited release in Los Angeles, and went back to see it 3 times because I enjoyed it so much.  I'm excited about this DVD release of ""New Suit"", because I want to hear the commentary track with the writer, who seems particularly astute at knowing what really happens behind-the-scenes in Hollywood.  I highly recommend this film.  Particularly if you ever wanted to be involved in the entertainment industry, this movie may make you think twice about those dreams!",1111104000,10,903,4.869281045751634
8047081,5,B0007DBJIC,"This indie really knocked my socks off in theaters (when it was in limited release) and I'm SO glad to see it out on DVD so now even more people can enjoy it.  It's a scathing and hilarious expos of Hollywood inanity, told with creative flair and a snarky wink.  The performances are good, but the writing is where this movie really shines.  You can tell the screenwriter Craig Sherman knows what he's talking about, has ""been there ... done that,"" yet still manages to keep his head on his shoulders and maintain a sense of humor about it all.  Lots of extras on this DVD, too.  If you like to follow (and make fun of) the Hollywood machine, then check out this impressive film... it deserves to get noticed!",1111017600,3,709,4.423076923076923
