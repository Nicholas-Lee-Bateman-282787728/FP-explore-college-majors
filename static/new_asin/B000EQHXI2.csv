2529741,5,B000EQHXI2,Well if you like me you did not find this show till you saw reruns of it on weekend mournings on ABC Family.  It quickly became a mourning habit of watching and I totally digged the show. I loved the style they used in using flashbacks to tell what was going on. I was glad to see it was out on DVD its a fun show and the characters are funny as hell (Eddie is my personal fav) I even got the rest of my family on it. I don't know how this season compares to the rest but I'm very happy with my purchase,1175990400,,503,3.7904761904761903
2529742,5,B000EQHXI2,This show is hysterically funny and it is consistent. There isn't a bad episode on any of the available DVD's. THe casting is perfect. All the characters contribute and all are funny and incredibly likable. If you haven't seen the show check it out. It's one of the best sitcoms ever that many have never heard of.,1158537600,3,314,4.526315789473684
2529743,5,B000EQHXI2,"First off its 1 AM on July 2nd.... That means I just finished the ABC Family marathon of the show!!! Yay!!! Now the show is great, but the sad thing is not many people even know it is around. I had never heard of it until it came to ABC Family. It is under-rated and the dvd is a must own for all fans of the show.",1151712000,2,314,3.701492537313433
2529744,5,B000EQHXI2,"as a uk resident, i had to wait until the early hours of the morning to watch GFL, and it was always the same few episodes repeated.

when i saw that the dvd's were to be released i was so happy.

GFL is one of those rare american tv shows that doesnt tire, and stays funny and realistic throughout. the characters are all beleivable, and are acted perfectly.

i cant wait for the rest of the seasons to come on sale.",1147996800,8,417,4.1234567901234565
2529745,5,B000EQHXI2,"The seasons of Grounded for Life are kind of a mess. The last five episodes of season one weren't run until season 2. But they are included on Season 1. For season 2, 17 new episodes were produced. This was also their last complete season on Fox as the third season had them swap over to the WB after only 3 episodes.  This is one of those shows that deserves a DVD release since it was nearly impossible to follow the show when it was broadcast. Donal Logue was one of the great TV dads - he was like Robert Young - if Robert had knocked up his wife in high school and pretty much went from teenager to dad without getting to enjoy his misspent college years.

The episode on the set include:

Don't Let Me Download
Bang on a Drum
Smoke on the Daughter
I Saw Daddy Hitting Santa Claus
We Are Family
Mr. Roboto
Don't Fear the Reefer
Take It to the Limit
Eddie Said Knock You Out
Safety Dance
Relax!
The Kids Are Alright
Swearin' to God
Eddie and This Guy with Diamonds
I Fought the In-Laws
Dust in the Wind
Oops!...I Did It Again

The bonus features on this 3 DVD collection include:

Bloopers
""From Ashes To Ashton"": An Interview with Ashton Kutcher
""Kevin Corrigan: He Ain't Eddie, He's My Brother"": A Brand New Interview with Kevin Corrigan (""Eddie"")
""Sibling Revelry"": Interviews with Jake Burbage (""Henry"") and Griffin Frazen (""Jimmy"")

2529754,4,B000EQHXI2,Good show!,1424995200,,10,4.5
2529755,3,B000EQHXI2,"I love the show but, the DVD picture quality is horrible not HD clear at all, wish it was clearer.",1419897600,,98,3.95
2529756,3,B000EQHXI2,Arrived in good condition.  Not so much the family friendly show I thought it would be.  Some very adult themes in this comedy.  Overall somewhat entertaining.,1413331200,,159,5.038461538461538
2529757,4,B000EQHXI2,I like it.  just plain old family fun.  The dad is at times a little over the top but it helps you to see that normal is in the eye of the beholder,1387497600,,147,3.4242424242424243
2529758,5,B000EQHXI2,"The movie shipped early, and came as described. It comes with three disks with all of the episodes in season 2.  I love it!",1376265600,,123,4.125
2529759,5,B000EQHXI2,"Keeps me laughing.  The quality is great, just like the original show without commercials.  Definitely look forward to adding seasons to my collection!",1373414400,,151,5.521739130434782
2529760,5,B000EQHXI2,didn't know it has so many seasons but im glad. laughed my butt off the whole time. It will never get old.,1370908800,,106,3.8636363636363638
2529761,5,B000EQHXI2,"Great show, I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it.  Uncle Eddie is a classic.  Will need to buy the first season.",1365638400,,113,4.090909090909091
2529762,5,B000EQHXI2,"I get this as a gift for my daughter and she was well pleased very happy with it.
I would not hesitate to buy again.",1358985600,,116,3.68
2529763,4,B000EQHXI2,"We haven't actually watched these yet,  We are big tv/ movie buffs and had watched the series on tv,  the price was right so we decided to add them to our collection.",1358726400,,166,4.15625
2529764,5,B000EQHXI2,I always loved the way this series would backtrack the episodes. You would first see the outcome of said adventure and then go backwards to find out what happened a long the way. This was a very different approach. It worked.,1356566400,,225,4.512195121951219

It is so much fun! We had lovely silly time with my teenage nephew and niece.",1344211200,,287,8.931034482758621
2529766,5,B000EQHXI2,"I will close this review by saying, the absolute best part of seeing this show was NOT looking around and seeing adults and kids laughing together at the same moments, but sitting next to a woman about my age with her two kids.  During a scene in which Walter is looking around old pictures on the wall featuring history came into view. I heard the mom next to me and I too wiped a few tears away. Her daughter leaned over and whispered, why are you crying?. you wouldn't understand",1333065600,,482,4.355555555555555
2529767,4,B000EQHXI2,"This is one of those shows that was kind of overlooked in its day. It was never top of the heap, but it was well produced and well acted. Season one was fresh, interesting, and I loved all the episodes.  At it's heart it's pure to what a ""sitcom"" is; it's a ""situation comedy"".  I very much like the style of story telling where they generally start in the middle and then bits get filled in as you go.  It's sort of like that old Seinfeld episode they did in reverse.

Season two isn't quite pure gold like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B0058EE6OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>&nbsp;was, which is to be expected with more episodes.  That's not to say that there are a lot of bad ones, but there were a couple that I just skipped over; to me the gay episode was just forced and tedious.  The cast remains the same, with the addition of Lily's new boyfriend who gets the screen time that the next door neighbor boy used to get. He's this drummer that I just didn't like for some reason. It's probably just me, but something about him was offputting. I liked the dorky neighbor better.  He isn't gone completely, just not shown as much.  If you didn't like him, it's a plus I suppose.

Even with one or two episodes that didn't pass muster, the vast majority of the season is great. For some reason they seem to be releasing a much cheaper price than their initial release. For the price you can get them now, this is completely a no-brainer. Buy the DVDs, you'll get WAY more fun than their cost.

If you like this series, you may also want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titus/dp/B0009K8LCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titus</a>.  It has a similar feel.",1329436800,2,1776,5.0479452054794525
2529768,5,B000EQHXI2,"I received it fast and in great shape. It shows how people who matured in the 80's, dealt with their kids. It's funny.",1326412800,,118,4.173913043478261
2529769,5,B000EQHXI2,Just like 8 Simple Rules I have been looking for this season everywhere.. I found the first season for $5.00 not to long ago and I was hoping to find season 2 as well but didn't I ordered this the same day I got 8 Simple Rules season 1... Great show! :),1319414400,,253,3.8846153846153846
2529770,5,B000EQHXI2,I don't ever purchase DVDs of tv shows with the exception of three and this is one of them. Acting isn't superb however that just adds to the comic relief. I honestly don't think I can pick a favorite season because it makes me LOL every time I watch it.,1295654400,,254,4.1
2529771,5,B000EQHXI2,"I watched this show for years and I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.  It's hard to find in stores, thank goodness for Amazon.  This season has some hilarious episodes.  It has fewer episodes than some shows, so that's a bit of a downer, but every one is different.  I really enjoy this show, it's a household favorite.",1248652800,2,323,4.333333333333333
2529772,5,B000EQHXI2,"This is a great show.  I really liked it while it was on, and decided to get the complete series to watch whenever I wanted.",1190937600,,124,3.96
2529773,4,B000EQHXI2,"Very good if you enjoyed season one. A very realistic view of what a crazy family is like who don't punish their children by means of physical contact, but by sitting them down and talking to them",1178409600,,196,4.324324324324325

8113352,5,B000EQHXI2,So fun,1466380800,,6,2.5
8113353,1,B000EQHXI2,I don't hate the show. I hate the DVD and how they put all the episodes on the DVDs. It is nothing like the casey warner original DVDs they put out. Their is a big difference if you want to buy this season I suggest buying  the Anchor Bay release then the mill creek DVD's. They are also packaged in paper black  sleeves for each DVD.  Unlike the anchor bay DVD's. I LOVE THIS Show I just don't ant someone who is looking to watch this to know they will not get a good quality looking DVD. I'm hoping to trade in my season 2 some where  in hopes of picking up the anchor bay season 2 DVD.,1463356800,,588,3.957627118644068
