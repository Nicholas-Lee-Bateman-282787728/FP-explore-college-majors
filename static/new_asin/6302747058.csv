This is how some of the episodes began, with this introduction by 'Remington Steele's' assistant, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist). Now you know the whole story behind Remington Steele. The Remington Steele series were about the cases Remington Steele (Pierce Brosnan) and his associate Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) cracked many difficult and complicated cases. Also starring were James Read as Murphy Michaels as their co-worker (only in the first season), Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe their secretary (only for the first season), and Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs (for the rest of the seasons). Showing occasionally was also Stephanie Zimbalist's father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Daniel Chalmers, an old friend of 'Remington Steele'.
Murphy Michaels calls Laura Holt to help him investigate a brutal murder. What he doesn't expect is when Remington tags along with her, complaining that Steele would mess up everything. So Remington strikes up a deal with Laura; if he figures out who the murderer is first, Laura must spend a weekend in Paris with him. But, on the other hand, if Laura catches the murderer first, Remington Steele must tell her about one year of his mysterious past. Who will find the murderer first? * I love this episode primarily because of the banter between Pierce Brosnan, Stephanie Zimbalist, and James Read. Also the sparks of jealousy between Remington Steele and Murphy Michaels over Laura is very interesting to watch! Very great ending, too, I might add!",1014595200,4,2270,4.976315789473684

This is how some of the episodes began, with this introduction by 'Remington Steele's' assistant, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist). Now you know the whole story behind Remington Steele. The Remington Steele series were about the cases Remington Steele (Pierce Brosnan) and his associate Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) cracked many difficult and complicated cases.

Showing occasionally was also Stephanie Zimbalist's father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Daniel Chalmers, an old friend of 'Remington Steele'.
Anyway, this episode is the premier episode which explains almost everything about how Pierce Brosnan got to be Remington Steele. When Laura Holt is hired to proved security to some gems, she meets a mysterious Ben Pierson. But she gets the surprise of her life when Ben Pierson is not only not the real Ben Pierson, he has assumed the role of Remington Steele! Does he know her secret, that her superior Remington Steele doesn't exist? And who is he really? Could he actually be a murderer and a thief? * Great episode, and I just loved the banter and chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist. And you've go to admit, Pierce Brosnan is a great suave and sophisticated Steele!",1013731200,18,2247,4.962864721485412
513684,4,6302747058,"Definatly one of my fav. eps, this video allows me to enjoy it again and again! I love the tension between Murphy, Steele, and Laura, as Laura and Steele vie for who can solve the case first. I love the bet that they make. ""One week in Paris, for one year of your life."" This is the episode where sparks really start to fly between Steele and Laura, you see them even closer two eps later in Vintage Steele, but that's a whole different story!",1008028800,,443,4.223529411764706
513685,5,6302747058,"One of the best episodes of Remington Steele that I've seen! The Steele  agency ends up in one of its strangest cases ever, protecting a man from  his wife and his wife and his wife and...
After having a nightmare full  of disjointed images, and the sight of a hatchet, a man named Frank Dannon  wakes up in a motel room, unable to remember anything. A moment later, an  arrow hits the wall just over his head.
He hires Steele and Laura to find  out who he is, and along the way they discover an odd little facet: This  man has been sustaining five households with five wives. And they're not  happy.
There's sophisticated fashion-designer Barbara, passionate  lower-class Stella, demure blonds Mary and Terry, and sexy vixen Nancy.  Most of them had the means, the opportunity--but did they all have a  motive? Meanwhile, middle-aged, romantic-at-heart Mildred makes a major  mistake in the course of the case, and feels that she's let Steele down.  The kind con-man sits her down and has a heart-to-heart talk with  Mildred...
There's comedy, creepiness, mystery, and romance in this  episode, as Frank tries to remember who would try to kill him, as Laura and  Steele try to keep him safe from his various wives and discern which one is  shooting arrows and wielding axes. It's a funny ride that won't leave you  disappointed.",968803200,4,1329,4.754385964912281
513686,5,6302747058,"The first of the Remington Steele series!
Laura Holt is an able,  intelligent detective, but sexism spills over when her agency is neglected  because she is a woman. So, she invents a fictional superior named  ""Remington Steele,"" a man who no one ever sees.
Her business  bustles until a man comes into her life, calling himself Remington  Steele--the problem is, she doesn't know where he comes from, who he is, or  what his real name is. ""Steele"" is handsome, sophistocated,  worldly, debonair, and apparently gleans all of his life knowledge from an  encyclopedic memory of old movies. But he also guards his secret past like  gold.
Laura has no choice but to keep the man as a sidekick, despite the  fact that he is hailed as a genius when she does all the work. Adding to  the oddity of the situation is the fact that she is fast falling in love  with him.
Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan reportedly didn't like  each other, but they project a sizzling screen chemistry.
Brosnan  manages to give a difficult character depth and an intriguing mystery,  exuding precisely the cultured warmth that is needed. But Steele is clearly  a very emotional man as well, whom Laura has a good influence  on.
Zimbalist creates a very feminine career woman, a great role model.  Laura is no Bond-babe. She is very pretty (not the standard Hollywood  ""pretty""--a natural prettiness) but is independent and  strong-minded. You can sense her unhappiness when she is discounted as  being a female private investigator.
First part of a really enjoyable  series!",968630400,11,1554,4.8961538461538465

7831444,5,6302747058,This entire TV series is amazing. Once I started it... I finished all 5 seasons within a month because I just couldn't stop watching them! Stephanie Zimbalist plays her part perfectly (I am now I die-hard fan of hers!) and Pierce Bronson kept me entertained. The cases they solved kept me guessing and their complicated `love affair' made me keep my fingers crossed. I don't usually leave reviews but this series deserves it!,1282780800,3,425,4.835616438356165
7831445,2,6302747058,"I thought this episode very strange.  Maybe I just don't like westerns.  It was like a slapstick western with too many characters.  I do like the Remington Steele TV show overall, but not really this one.",1272412800,,204,4.611111111111111
7831446,5,6302747058,"Our family had VHS video copies of TV broadcasts of Remington Steele.  We now have DVDs of 5 seasons.  What a pleasure to watch.  We have two TiVos in our home, and have downloaded Seasons 1 & 2 to the TiVos.  My wife is the big Remington Steele fan, and now when she sits down to take a break, she can bring up a TiVo copy of one of the episodes, even resuming one she was watching earlier.

I like the fact that we can delete the episode from the TiVo, but also download it again later.  For TiVo users with limited storage, consider buying an entire season, but only downloading a few shows at a time.

A quarter of a century later, and this show still has its ability to hold the viewer.  The character - Laura Holt, played by Stephanie Zimbalist had been an inspiration to many young women to make the effort to succeed, even when others is wanting another gender.  This is the show that introduced Pierce Brosnan, who went on to make greater fame.

It is also a wonderful treat to see Doris Roberts from 'back in the day'.  Her warm and energetic ability has endured through the many seasons of Everyone Loves Raymond.  For those of you that enjoyed her in her later years, come see her again.

This is safe and enjoyable family quality mystery adventure, without the potty-mouth four-letter words today's show think they must insert to be relevant.  (I just can't allow my grand-children to share in some of the current shows because of language and words used that are never uttered in our home nor with any of the other families we associate with)",1197244800,7,1556,4.433098591549296

This is one of the best shows ever shown on tv. Intelligent, great writing, sexual tension, and comedy that would sum up the show of Remington Steele!
I love Stephanie Zimbalist's role as Laura Holt... Beautiful, smart, and fashionable! Most of the stuff she worn on the show is still very fashionable today.. very CK, Banana Republic, Club Monoco like stuff..
I just love her very real and beautiful image... very un-hollywood like.. and I do think if she was 10-15 years younger she would have the carrer of Sandra Bullock.",1038355200,4,558,4.762886597938144
