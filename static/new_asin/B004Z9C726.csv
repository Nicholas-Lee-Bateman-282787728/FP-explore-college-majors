When I heard she had created this ""Restorative Exercises after Breast Cancer"" DVD, I was very pleased to be able to still practice with Lisa.  Because my upper body has always been an exercise challenge for me...this DVD workout is great and gentle and perfect for me, although I have not had breast cancer, surgery; yet I have had breast reduction surgery.  This DVD is very helpful & Lisa is great.",1378339200,,525,4.381443298969073
8449549,5,B004Z9C726,"And this DVD helps.  I find it relaxing, refreshing, and just challenging enough.  It has four different workouts, each about 20 minutes, that are progressively more difficult so you can build your strength and flexibility gradually.  As most reading this know, it's tough to rebuild yourself after surgery; you're sore, stiff, and bored.  When you try to do anything you did before, it's overwhelming and tends to be too much.
This DVD has helped me take the steps to ease back into normal exercise, while listening to by body and respecting it's limitations.
It has really helped me.",1368662400,2,585,4.938775510204081
8449550,5,B004Z9C726,I'm so grateful that I found this video.  My mom is a breast cancer survivor and really needed someone (or something) to come into her home and be her companion and motivator.  I occasionally call to give a gentle reminder to pop it in the dvd player.  One time when I called she mentioned that I might like to try the video to help with my back trouble.  Other excercise seems to be to vigerous for my back.  I tried it and it worked!  I feel longer and stronger and have since moved on to a more intense work out.  The fun part is that when we are together we do the excercises along with a little giggling!  Thanks for helping both of us move forward!,1325980800,3,654,4.134920634920635
8449551,5,B004Z9C726,"Lisa Gulotta's new DVD, The Next Step: Restorative Exercises After Breast Cancer is volume 1 in what will hopefully be an on-going series of classes designed for cancer patients and others who have undergone surgery, are recovering from an accident, or simply need to start a gentle restorative exercise program to regain stamina and self-confidence. In the DVD, Lisa is calm, articulate, and assumes viewers have no previous yoga or movement experience. She explains clearly what she is going to teach, provides a visual and explanatory introduction to each of the props, and precedes to take students through four classes--always mindful that her students might be exhausted, sore, a bit depressed, or low on energy for a variety of reasons. She is all about guiding her students gently back to health. This doesn`t mean the exercises are easy. They look easy at first viewing -- an aside, it really is important to take Lisa's advice and view the DVD all the way through at least once before trying the exercises on your own - but, having worked my way through the video, I guarantee you'll be flushed when you're finished. Each class builds on the instructions in the previous class. Viewers can choose to go at their own pace, Lisa's instruction is slow but not sleepy - she guides students both verbally and through carefully executed demonstrations providing opportunities to start slowly, adding a class every week or so or to jump right in and do two or more classes in a session. Again, as Lisa points out, it is always important to follow each session with a 10-minute relation period either on your own or through her meditative guidance. My one quibble with the video is the sound quality.  Although turning the volume up on both the disc and my computer to maximum levels, it was sometimes difficult to hear the instructions.  Hooking the computer into speakers or playing the DVD on a television with a sound system should solve the problem. However, I like the mobility of a laptop to bring the DVD to the mat and there were times, especially laying down, that it was difficult to hear. That shouldn't dissuade anyone from purchasing the video - just play it on the proper equipment and you will be well on your way to a healthier lifestyle.",1309824000,3,2257,4.799485861182519
8449552,5,B004Z9C726,"The exercises and guided meditation in this DVD are also helpful after open heart surgery.  The same problems of lack of mobility, flexibility and upper body strength plagued me after quad by-pass surgery six years ago.  I discovered Lisa's classes about six months after my surgery and for the last five and one-half years she has been a guide in restoring my mobility, flexibility and strength! I highly recommend this video to both men and women after open heart surgery (when the doctor allows) and the guided meditation can help with the frustrations of recovery!",1307664000,2,568,4.968421052631579
