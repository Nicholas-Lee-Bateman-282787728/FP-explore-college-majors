772340,4,6304078102,"This is a good movie. I like movies, that show you a character and his place in history. Forrest Gump would be a perfect example. You get to see Richard Dreyfuss as a part of the history in this movie. Having footage that helps to transition the period of time, has always been one of my favorite aspects of this movie. One thing that I do not like, and have not liked every time I have watched this movie, is the ending. It is so cheesy. The acting is bad. The rest of the movie is great, but the ending and the acting during the ending scene is terrible.",1518048000,,556,4.110091743119266

So many times we think our lives are so boring and unimportant.  We are disappointed in the hand we are dealt in life.  We feel we never accomplish what we are put here on Earth to do, that everything and everybody gets in the way.  We focus on how ""wrong"" everything is going.  Even though this isn't a ""Christian"" movie, it shows how the LORD works everything out for good, and our good desires are placed in us by His hand, and they can amount to a far greater and deeper life.  And yes, we are MORE than satisfied with it.  And NO,  it's not a ""Christian"" movie this is just our family's perspective.  It's awesome!",1506038400,,749,4.204225352112676

772510,5,6304078102,"How many ""teachers save our youth"" movies can you watch? ""To Sir with Love"", Blackboard Jungle"", ""Saving Forester"", and so on and so on. Since you ask, At least one more time.

Mr. Holland wants to write music and believes that teaching will give him the free time to compose. Slowly he gets sucked into the teaching environment and eventually this becomes his focus to the exclusion of his deaf son. Will he see what he is doing? Will he care? Or maybe skip town with a talented singer (Rowena)?

This well paced film that does not save hooligans but enriches an otherwise droll school experience and encourages more than just the basics.

A twist on the standard formula is the emphasis from the beginning on Holland more than a student or two. We see how he learns from the school environment and incorporates his life into the life of the school. Richard Dreyfuss being the main character may over shadow good acting by Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy among others. There are several inspiring moments and some sobering moments.
In all it is worth the time and you will want to watch it again.",1502755200,,1101,4.607142857142857

772761,5,6304078102,"An honest to goodness film about music and musicians and making music; alright, most of them are amateur musicians in a high school class, but you have to start somewhere.

This is a very nice film that follows the trials and tribulations of a musician who needs a paying gig so he decides to teach high school music for a year or two ... and that stretches into about 3 decades, by which time he doesn't want to leave.  He finds himself by teaching music to people, some of whom have talent, others that don't -- all the kinds of things you expect to find in such a class.

It's fun to watch and with a lot of music of many different kinds.

There are other movies about music (e.g., ""The Red Violin"") and I'm glad to add this one to my list of favorites.",1470787200,,756,4.1931034482758625

The fact is, this movie is presented in a 4:3 Full Screen format.  Like any other Full Screen movie, when you view this movie on a widescreen TV, the sides are black.  I feel the DVD Box labeling is misleading.  It is technically correct.  The movie is presented in the 2.35:1 format, but that is within a Full Frame format.  So, not only do you have black margins on the sides, but you also have black margins on the top and bottom.  And the movie is small to view.  It is unlike any usual widescreen presentation. The box should have said, a Full Screen (4:3) presentation of the original theatrical letterbox format.  Don't buy this unless you are desperate.",1462233600,2,796,4.621428571428571

773026,2,6304078102,"I guess ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" was supposed to be about an inspirational music teacher throughout his career to give the audience tears of sentimental joy. As a classical musician, all I can say is ""Oh brother"". There are some really fine films in this sub-genre about teachers, mentors, or coaches engaging with students, athletes, etc., including ""Dead Poet's Society"", ""Hoosiers"", and probably the finest one, ""Stand and Deliver"". ""Stand and Deliver"" was based on a real teacher who found creative ways to speak and teach to minority students struggling in East Los Angeles. As far as I know, ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" wasn't based on a real music teacher, and too many of the incidences shown were clearly written by people who knew next-to-nothing about the music universe.

Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is an aspiring musician who has dreams of making it big as an established composer. He then takes a position at a high school as their music teacher as a means to compose. Of course, the inevitable ""resentment"" of the other faculty emerges as he proves to be one of the most popular teachers in the school. Simultaneously, the faculty constantly belittle the value of teaching music in the classroom. As a classical musician myself, I applaud the idea of an inspirational music teacher fighting for the importance of the arts and music public high schools. However, I found the premise so obviously contrived I couldn't help saying to myself ""oh dear Lord"" in many scenes. I was in high school when there was drastic cutting of arts and music funding, but I never found the faculty dismissive of the music teachers.

One of the other terrible aspects of this film is whoever produced it didn't bother to simply hire a bona fide orchestral conductor and show Dreyfuss how to conduct. While I will agree Dreyfuss' performance is relatively good given the material, his conducting is absolutely god-awful. The upbeat cue to begin a piece is completely incorrect. You don't just start slide into it after a couple of little beats. You actually take a virtual ""breath"" and clearly indicate the cue beat which signals the performers to begin. And he constantly moves his upper body up and down with the beat as he conducts, which is complete no-no as it's distracting to the performers. If the character is supposed to be this amazing musician, why does it seem like he never took conducting in college?

While he's teaching during many years, he's writing ""An American Symphony"" on the side, supposedly his magnum opus. At the end of the film, as a tribute to him, many of his former students, now adults, produce a concert to play his ""opus"". And then it's really OMG, this is so bad. His final piece is a silly ultra-clich-ridden little monster masquerading as a ""great orchestral work"". All the melodies sound like overused tracks from bad films from the 1970's, including an unremarkable string theme, used ad infinitum on many pieces and songs from the mid-20th century. Also the piece is not truly orchestrated in terms of varying the instruments. All the instruments play ""tutti"" constantly, in other words, all the instruments play during the whole piece. This is not how orchestral works are written. The music should vary with different instruments playing melody and harmony in different passages, otherwise the piece becomes monotonous, which literally means ""sounding the same"". In great works, only in a few dramatic moments does an orchestra play tutti. And the drum section only makes the whole thing sound pop-oriented; I couldn't take it seriously. The Opus really does sound like a high school student's first stab at writing an orchestral work. It doesn't even sound good enough for the Boston Pops who were always playing very light orchestral music. Unfortunately, Holland's ""opus"" wasn't even so bad it's good. Even rock songs from the 1980's are more easily tolerated than the ""Opus"".

The good films in this genre have a lot of bite and grit in them, particularly ""Stand and Deliver"" and ""Dead Poet's Society"". Both deal with social and societal issues. Some of the best, like ""Stand and Deliver"" were based on true-life experiences. However, ""Opus"" is too saccharine and contrived for its own good. While Mr. Holland deals with his student's problems, I never got the sense the story was real but rather artificial and written by people who didn't really know this subject. And the Opus at the end proved that Holland really wasn't that great a composer. He's lucky he received his job in the first place! Of course, there are many fans of this film, and I am sure I've caused many grievances with this review. However I can tell you, no matter how much this film may ""move you"", this is not what I experienced as a classical musician in school. There's a lot more blood, sweat and tears than what's shown here. Students don't always listen to the teacher, sometimes playing when they shouldn't be. Some teachers berate lesser-skilled players. Playing music in educational institutions is not the easiest of tasks including both student and teacher alike, but I don't believe the makers of ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" quite understood that.",1460937600,,5160,4.934407364787112

773155,4,6304078102,"There are indeed some fine scenes in this film.  There are also scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The line ""Play the sunset"" is one of the most ludicrous lines ever voiced by any actor, yet Dreyfus pulls it out in yeoman fashion.  Another hard to take scene is the one in which Glenn Holland bemoans the retirement of teachers as they have little to show for their careers.  This may be true of plumbers or lawyers, but not of teachers.
  And writers - how could Holland have heard the epic ""A Love Supreme"" at 15 when the album wasn't released until February 1965!!!!  Hello!!!!
It's not a bad film, just a tad heavy-handed and overly sentimental.",1452902400,,676,4.491803278688525

773229,4,6304078102,"Mr. Hollands Opus is about a man who decided to pick up teaching as a part time gig and use all the time he had outside of school to write his own music. He quickly finds that this is not the case, and that being a teacher is a lot harder than he ever imagined. There is rarely any free time, the students are a lot harder to handle than he thought, and he struggles to get his students to care. At least in the beginning. One of the first things that Mr. Holland did to get his class more interested in class was to incorporate their own favorite music into the class. He showed the connections between classical and rock and roll. He also spent time with students to overcome their problems. One situation of this was with a student who just couldn't seem to play her instrument correctly, but Mr. Holland helped her learn to play, and she played the instrument well. Another instance is when there was a student who was really talented, who kept coming to class high. The student claimed that he could easily pass the class without trying, so he might as well come to class high. Mr. Holland brought this student to a funeral of a previous student who had died in a war, Russ. Russ was a person who tried his best but wasn't nearly as talented as the student who could do everything high. This was a powerful scene for the student to witness, and he turned his attitude around. The background music in this film was very good, and made certain scenes very powerful. I would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie. It is a little bit on the longer side, but it is well worth it to sit down and find the time to watch this wonderful movie.",1444780800,,1645,4.309677419354839

I remember my sister buying the soundtrack and playing it all of the time. I recommend purchasing the soundtrack as well.

Now as a teacher myself, I rewatched it and looked at it differently. I feel for Mr. Holland as he tries to find his joy for teaching and how he later struggles to balance his work and home life.

Richard Dreyfus does a phenomenal job as Mr. Holland and deserves all of the accolades he earned following the movie.

But there is much to like about this film and the inspiration value is off the charts.  Every teacher--and especially legislators who think teachers are lazy, overpaid and under-worked--needs to not only watch this film, but memorize the classic line from Mr. Holland's PE teacher friend ""I can't remember the last time I had that was free.""

Good teachers have little or no time of their own--and will tell you that their sacrifice is ""no big deal.""  It is too bad that most teachers will never see the impact they are having on young people like Mr. Holland was privileged to observe and experience at the film's conclusion.",1396051200,,765,4.7218045112781954

774632,5,6304078102,"Love for this film is not always common in the cinephile community, a community that can be unfairly harsh on overly sentimental films that are obviously aiming for the jugular and intend to make you cry.  Some films shamelessly work that at every corner and overdo it to no end.  For me, Mr. Hollands Opus, while obviously going for it, works because it all feels so human, honest and balanced.

While the rest of the world ate up The Dead Poets Society, I was unmoved and rather cold towards it, and yet this is probably my equivalent to that particular film.

One thing that always got me with this film, and the thing that, in my eyes, sets it apart from most in the genre, is that the portrayal of Glenn Holland is extremely honest.  It doesnt paint him as some martyr, some unblemished soul with the heart of gold who inspires unabashedly and is pure to the bone.  Holland is an emotional mess (not in the theatrical sense) and has severe issues.  Yes, there are the dramatic familial matters (a deaf son) and the professional issues (trouble with the school budget) but at the heart of Holland is a man who is conflicted and distraught and someone who is making some seriously misguided decisions.

But, above all that, this is the story of one mans love for music and the power that that love can have on a person.  Through this mans struggle, we see how his devotion to his craft makes him a tortured artist as well as a tortured family man, but also a remarkable talent and a teacher with a real gift and real love for that gift in others.

Richard Dreyfuss is remarkable here.  In fact, this is one of those layered and just outright beautiful performances that makes it hard for me to understand how others can see this.  Ive heard many balk at his Oscar nom, like it wasn't worthy, but in my eyes hell always be a deserving force.  The way he handles each layer of this man is outstanding and so detailed, never overbearing or overwrought.  He gets it all just right.  Glenne Headly is also very good here.

The genre has been done, redone and done again (the whole teacher/student formula) but this is one that is done better than most and adds layers that the others dont, taking it a step further and giving us a complete picture that we can love.",1392076800,,2263,4.443099273607748

He does not earn enough money to continue supporting himself and his wife Iris (Glenne Headly) in this manner, transitions into survival mode and takes a job as a high school music teacher under the guidance and encouragement of a female principal (Olympia Dukakis).  He plunges into his new job with courage and determination, but without previous teaching experience.  This shortfall soon becomes obvious as he forcefully tries to impart music theory into his student's minds with lectures plus question and answer sessions and perfect their performance techniques with classical music drills based on trial and error.  These methods create tension and boredom among his students along with loss of faith in their instructor.  Mr. Holland realizes that he is going down the wrong road and the students are not having fun.  He scraps his failing methods and begins to use rock music examples to illustrate the points he needs to make.  His students light up, start smiling, digging in and catching on.  During the buildup to the movie's end, Mr. Holland continues to compose and eventually finishes the symphony he always wanted to create.  The movie plays down Mr. Holland's work on the symphony, leaving the audience free to forget about it as other events distract the audience.  The audience also is distracted, saddened and irritated by seemingly irrelevant material placed before the movie's end to condition them for the final uplift.  The final scene is a huge reunion involving Mr. Holland and the music students who were taught by him over a thirty-year interval.  It includes a stirring first performance of his symphony.  The result is dramatic enough to drive reasonably sensitive members of the audience into huge spasms of tearful joy.",1386115200,,1922,5.141479099678457

775574,5,6304078102,"It is cold and rainy today. Snow is coming. I needed something warm and friendly. ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" seemed like it would fill the bill. It is a film I have seen four times prior to today. I have enjoyed it each time, but today I found myself very moved by it. Maybe it's late midlife, maybe it's being unemployed, maybe it's my general state of concern for our educational system, or maybe it's my need to focus on what really counts and how we really touch each other's lives.

Today, what held my attention was the relationship between a father whose life is built upon music and a son who cannot hear a note. Each struggles to ""listen"" to the other but lack a common medium. And then music shows the way. A deaf Beethoven lies upon the floor listening to his piano by way of the vibrations that pass from piano through wood. Cole tunes an engine be touching his ear to a screwdriver resting on the motor. Glenn Holland learns to speak to his son through sign language and the linking of sound to light. The film is all about listening and hearing. A new teacher who teaches because he cannot make a living as a composer listens to a principal who challenges his lack of connection and he becomes a master teacher. A husband listens to a wife looking to make a life, to have a home, and to reach beyond the deafness of a child to enter that child's mind. A wife listens to her husbands desire for fresh love from a student infatuated with him and stands off to the side knowing that he would do the right thing. A football coach befriends a music teacher, becomes his ally and then teaches his band to march, and his football players to dance listening to a side of himself that was easily shut down. A teacher listens to a football coach who says that the failure of a student to learn is a greater challenge to the teacher not the end of the road for the student.

In the closing scene Mr. Holland, ending his career because the music program that he created has been eliminated, figures his life has amounted to very little. And then he gets to conduct a piece of music he has been trying to complete for 40 years. That piece of music is not confined to the pages before him or to the instruments that sound the notes. The musical masterpiece, his opus, is the great work he has done with the people whose paths he crossed in his apparently not-so-great life.

Life isn't always good to him, a musician with a son who is almost completely deaf and cannot share his passion for his work.  Little if no time to do what he loves most, which is compose a great work which will make him both rich, and famous.  Indeed, on some level, don' we all wish for that?  To pour forth our creativity and have the world applaud us for it?

He teaches for 30 years before finally being told that he is being ""downsized"" and the school budget can no longer support the arts program.  To spend your whole life doing what you didn't even want to do in the first place, to only THEN be told there is no longer a need for you to do it?  Any of us would feel bitter and wonder if it was all worth it.

But the final scene, when he is surprised by a collection of his students, both past and present, showing him that he in fact DID compose his magnus opus......in the minds and hearts of every single person he touched.  Yes, it smacks of Frank Capra.  Yes, it may seem unrealistic and downright schmaltzy on occasion.  But we as individuals NEED to know that our lives mattered.  We NEED to know that our lives touched others and left them the better for it. And even though we may never see the outpouring of love that Glenn Holland saw in his lifetime, we SHOULD celebrate those who have touched our lives.

775713,4,6304078102,"This is simply a nice, dramatic story of a music teacher's life. Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher, ""Glenn Holland."" It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.

The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son.

The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt, who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor; Terrence Howard, a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam, and Jean Louisa Kelly, the last and most memorable student perhaps, an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.

Interwoven are some personal stories, particularly with Kelly's character, and with fellow teachers (Jay Thomas playing the most likable) and school administrators (Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy). The most personal, of course, involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son (played by three different actors as time passes.) Glenne Headly, meanwhile, plays Dreyfuss' wife.

As you can see by this cast, this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable - as Hollywood seems to be - to control their political bias by giving us unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts. In addition, atheist John Lennon is almost deified in this film as one of the ""heroes"" of the 20th century, plus there are a few more digs and plugs here and there, all with the normal Liberal bias. Gee, why couldn't they just stick the story?

The movie seems to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative, but it works. In addition to Hollywood's normal love affair of teachers, it is also a plug, if you will, for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability.",1237766400,,1903,4.879256965944273

775716,5,6304078102,"Mr. Holland's Opus - A truly inspirational film!

The dream of this man, Glenn Holland, played masterfully by Richard Dreyfuss is to write music. A young wife and the responsibility of a baby about to arrive make him seek a job as a music teacher. Soon, he is no longer paying the rent of an apartment, but considering a house because they no longer fit within such confined space.

His dream to compose one piece that would achieves his dream to leave a legacy to make a difference in the music world is set aside as he takes on the role of mentor, husband, friend, father, teacher, counselor and the more involved he becomes in the dreams of his students, the further his dream appears to be.

Richard Dreyfuss acts with amazing honesty, revealing feelings of love, inspiration, frustration, anger, anxiety with such finesse that we care and suffer right along side the Holland family.

There are many quotes that stayed with us as we watched this fantastic film, lines said with such profound wisdom that I noted them down to ponder on the lessons learned. One of my favorite statements is what we learn as we navigate our own lives, and that is:

* Life is what happens to us when we are busy making other plans.

The movie takes us through his entire life, from 1965 to the 90s and it is remarkable how it weaves viewers through the fabric of the turmoil of the 60's, the challenges of the 70s and 80s and finally to the time he is forced to leave the teaching profession because the music program at his school is canceled due to budgetary pressures.

And here is where the movie made us cry. On his way out, he feels the nagging pressure of having given up his dreams for nothing, because now, he does not even have his job. As he clears his office, taking his things in boxes with the help of his wife and son, Mr. Holland hears sounds in the auditorium and goes to investigate what that is all about, only to find all his students... all graduating classes have gathered to thank a man that gave them the gift of music.

A student whom he tutored during his first year as a teacher is now Governor and she delivers the most beautiful lines during this movie, for she tells Mr. Holland that ""he has profoundly influenced my life and the lives of all gathered in this auditorium. I have the feeling that Mr. Holland considers a large part of his own life misspent because he never accomplished the symphony he was composing to make him famous, rich, or probably both.""

And as she looks around the room, filled with students, parents, friends, she says: ""Mr. Holland, you are not rich or famous, at least not beyond the walls of this hall, so you may think you are a failure, but you would be wrong, because you have achieved a success beyond riches and fame, for as you look around you, you have touched the lives of all gathered here. We are your symphony Mr. Holland, we are the melodies and the notes of your opus... we are the music of your life!""

If you want to see a movie that touches your heart, if you have teenagers that are in need of inspiration, and if you wonder about dreams you have set aside to accomplish much for others, watch this film and the true purpose of life will reveal that fame and fortune are not necessarily the true goals in life.

As always, she was correct. Mr. Holland's Opus is, by far, one the BEST movies ever made!!! There are so many personalities exhibited; full ranges of emotions explored and expressed. It is amazing to watch the unfolding of a person's life. And it is truly wondrous to see how so many small actions and events affect so many people. This movie particularly touches my heart because I am currently seeking teacher certification. It is movies like Mr. Holland's Opus that encourage me, and prove that an individual, or more personally, a teacher, can make a tremendous impact on a child and/or community. I, in turn, encourage you, the reader, to watch Mr. Holland's Opus, and be moved in the same ways so many others have.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Holland-s-Opus/dp/6305428352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Holland's Opus</a>",1228262400,,1050,5.447852760736196

This DVD is a bit long, but it includes some great music, fine acting, and many touching scenes.  I saw it on TV one evening, and decided I needed to get the DVD so I could watch it several more times.  Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding as Mr. Holland, a high school music teacher and father.  The film covers his life from his first days as a teacher to his forced retirement many years later.  His love of his wife and deaf son as well as his dedication to teaching touches many lives through the years.  He experiences many highs and lows.  If you appreciate great acting and music, you'll love this film.",1217030400,,758,5.38135593220339
775785,5,6304078102,"I must confess that before writing this review, I read some of the lower-rated reviews first.  It seems that the common complaint is that it's over-sentimental, over-dramatic, etc.  I even read one in which the reviewer said it ""glosses over"" the tragedy of the music program being cut, and shouldn't have been a happy ending.

Okay, well, I am a music teacher.  I can honestly say that the threat of budget cuts and loss of arts programs is a very real fear that we live with from year to year.  We have more work than any other teacher and, in many cases, less respect.  Mr. Holland's plight is not terribly exaggerated.  Furthermore, his effect on his students is not exaggerated either.  I haven't been teaching long enough to have that much impact on my students (one semester of student teaching doesn't really change lives), but I have watched enough music teachers to know that they have a profound influence on students.  The concepts in this movie are certainly not made up.

This movie is beautiful, and shows not only Mr. Holland's virtues, but his flaws as well -- and how he overcomes them.  No one likes the idea of a teacher falling for his beautiful student.  No one likes the idea of a father avoiding his son simply because he is deaf.  But he overcomes these things, and that is what matters!  Throughout his career, he grows as a person and touches many lives.  That is what makes this movie beautiful.",1214697600,2,1423,4.613545816733068

Also impressive was the appearance of being swept along by life's events and yet finishing with a great goal accomplished.

The love and respect between father and son dealt a separating wall by life was also remarkable.",1210723200,,466,4.935897435897436
775787,5,6304078102,"Very few movies can be defined as perfect, this is one of them. None of the acting is over the top, Richard Dreyfus is exceptional in the role and there isn't a blemish on a single of the supporting actors and actresses.  Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Glenn Headley all are assets to the production.

A young Terrence Howard shows a hint of his future talent as a poor student who Holland takes under his wing and teaches the bass drum as a trade-off to the PE teacher who agrees to teach Holland's students to march.

Covering 30 years and hundreds of countless lives that he touched, the movie highlights the talent of a young Jean Louisa Kelly who can bring one to tears with her version of ""Someone To Watch Over Me"".

The movie montages several of the strifeful events of the 60s and 70s which add context to the times with the assassination of John Lennon being the most significant considering it brings Holland and his deaf son Cole to a crossroad in their relationship.

The one aspect that was somewhat disappointing but not at all a judgement on the film is the fact that after all he had done, he was easily cast aside over budget cuts.  When we as a society simply can't afford to employ such a man who influenced so many people, it's probably time to reassess our values.",1210464000,5,1289,4.463829787234043

There are plenty of critics that interpret the quality of the film, and plenty of buyers who rated their delivery service, but I feel the need to find the middle ground.  If you want a powerful movie that you will watch more than once... and something that you can easily enjoy with the whole family, this film is for you.

Set in the turbulence of the 1960's it sweeps you through 30 years of this man's life (the real-life events that are woven through it are well done). It is the story of a man with good intentions, a teacher who is still learning himself. Glenn Holland (played by Richard Dreyfuss) is an aspiring composer who turns to teaching music at a local high school as a way to help make ends meet and still have time for his composing. His dream in life is to compose an opus that would one day make him famous. His wife (played by Glenne Headley) is loving, devoted and supportive wife. Things begin to change when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child. Initially, Glenn has a great difficulty dealing with the fact that his son is deaf and gradually we see him pulling away from his family. For him, it is incomprehensible to have a child who is unable share his love of music. As we all do, Glenn has his faults, but he has a very big heart which keeps you tuned in to caring about him.
  This movie is about real people in realistic situations. We see a struggling teacher, the wife who supports the struggling teacher through everything, a caring well intentioned principal, a very strict, rigid vice principal, and the students who can all be found in any high school anywhere in the U.S.. The one thing that makes this movie magical is the simplicity of it.
  He's not a bad man, on the contrary, he's just a man. This is an inspirational movie that will stay with you long after you see it for the first time. It is the story of how you can discover new dreams as you pursue the old ones. Tried, true and timeless it is probably Richard Dreyfuss' greatest role yet. There are nothing but remarkable performances by this cast which includes Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt just to name a few.
  One thing that cannot be omitted from a review of this spectacularly moving film is the fantastic soundtrack. This PG movie should be required viewing for all music students (who knows, they might learn alot from it).",1188691200,,2150,4.55699481865285

He'd been in countless movies before and has starred in a number since, But this film... this film alone... cemented his name into the annuls of Hollywood History forever.

Mr. Holland (Dreyfuss) is an aspiring musician who decides to take on a job as a music teacher while he's waiting for his musician career to take off. Fast forward 30 some odd years. Teacher Mr. Holland is still working on what he feels is his greatest musical accomplishment. All along, he's helped others appreciate music and, in many ways, appreciate life through the appreciation of music.

Life struggles, including a deaf son, seem to always blind Mr. Holland to the symphony he's writing every day... in the hearts of the people around him.

""Mr. Holland might think himself a failure..."" one former student laments near the end of the story... ""and he would be wrong...""

775885,4,6304078102,"Without becoming breezy or overly sentimental, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' shows us the dilemma of many teachers.  How does one juggle all of the piles of responsibility one is given, and how does one rise above the fray to achieve greatness?  With many hurdles to overcome, Glenn Holland (in an extraordinary performance by Richard Dreyfuss) comes to Portland's Kennedy High School with the aspiration of employment filler with enough free time to compose his own music.  Naive about the demands for extra-curriculars and student tutoring, Glenn, nevertheless, must reinvent the wheel and learn to accomodate his students by taking risks to win their love for music.  Locking heads with the vice principal (played with perfect starchy officiousness by William Macy), he nearly loses his job and composure.  At home his loving, understanding wife will stand by him, but plausibly loses patience when their own beloved son (who was born deaf) gets the shaft on some quality mentor time.  Feeling his pain, we also are absorbed in the lives of key students (in fine early performances by Terrence Howard and [Forrest] Whitaker to name a couple).  He gets reprieves with the football coach (Jay Thomas) who offers friendship and a spirited rivalry.  With a rising starlet at his school and the soundtrack of their lives evolving to John Lennon, the poignancy of a man who has painted himself into a corner comes to roost.

'Mr. Holland's Opus' is as realistic as it is an emotional dead ringer.  Admittedly, I prejudged this movie on the notion that it would be facile, cloying, or overly sentimental.  Nothing could be further from the truth.",1181520000,,1633,5.033457249070632

Most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers, teachers that can do no wrong.  Here, we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome isn't always the best.  He's a man who knows how to do one thing, and that one thing he does so well, but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one's he loves the most.  Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss in a career best) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills.  His wife (Glenne Headley) is supportive, yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change.  Their relationship is tried as Glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who can't share his love of music is killing him.  Glenn is a very flawed man, but he has a very big heart and that's why this film works so well.  When Glenn starts to fall in love with a student you don't hate him as much as you feel bad for him.  He's far from a bad man, he's just a man.  This is truly one of the most touching, inspirational and blessed movies I've ever seen.  It's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time I watch it.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast and a very true to life feel to the script and to the performances you feel as though you know these people, and by the end of the film you'll want to.

775948,4,6304078102,"Being a musician myself, this movie appeals to me since not very many music-based movies are well made.  This just happens to be one of the better ones out there.

Being a composer, Mr. Holland signed up to be a music teacher at the local high school thinking this will give him money and the time to do composing.  Like many people out there, he did not realise how much time consuming being a teacher is and discovered it very quickly.

With the movie starting in the turbulent 60s, we see Mr. Holland go through his life in the next 30 years.  Along with his lives, we can see the real life events happenening throughout times.  Events such as the Vietnam War, Nixon being impeached, the Flower Children days, through the disco days, and etcetera.

Mr. Holland comes off as a self-centred person through many areas in the movie.  His attitudes reflect his desire to compose an opus that would make him famous.  Many of us can relate to this: the dreams we wish to achieve with many setbacks along our ways.  However, we are shown that even though Mr. Holland starts off as a stuffy person who only seems to care for himself, he slowly transitions into a person who can be just as compassionate as others.

This movie is about real people put in real situation.  We see a struggling teacher, a wife who supports the struggling teacher through everything, a caring principal, a very strict, uptight vice principal, a ""gum-chewing coach"", and the students who all represents ourselves in some ways or another.  None of the musicians in here are prodigy, although some do show more talents than others.

However, this movie doesn't get a full 5-star.  It had potential to be a 5-star movie, but my major complaint is the script.  At many times in the movie, it felt fragmented, poor flow.  The transition worked really nice, but the scenes were a bit off.

This movie may not be a true story, but after watching it, you can't help be imagine that it was, and that this story can happen to anyone at anytime.  A story of a teacher who achieves more than he hoped he did.  A story of how one person can make a difference in just the world he lives in.",1146441600,,2148,4.487113402061856

While it is doubtful (although not entirely implausible) that the people whose lives Mr. Holland touched would be able to pull off a concert honoring the man like they did at the end of the movie, WHY should that detract from your enjoyment of the film? As Woody Allen said in ANNIE HALL, you can't get things perfect in life, so you try to get them perfect in art. Who the hell wanted to see Glenn Holland walk out of the school the last time dejected and forgotten? This is a man who gave up his dream (at first out of necessity but eventually out of dedication) to teach high school kids the wonder of music, and at the end of the movie he should walk out of the place for the last time thinking he's a failure? That is nonsense.

As for his less-than-perfect character, it made him human. His profound disappointment at his son's deafness (something perfectly understandable, as he's a musician and wants to share his love of music with his son) is something he eventually comes to terms with (although it takes a long time) - yes, it's selfish of him to feel that way, but again, he's human. The moment when he figures out a way to communicate with his son using music is wonderful. As for comments about the place of the arts in schools, when Mr. Holland tells the school board that they're creating a generation of children who will not be able to think or create, he's absolutely right. There is a bankruptcy of imagination in this country, and cutting the arts is a big part of that problem.

To me and most people in band, music is more important than core classes and funding SHOULD be provided by the school. My band has to fund itself, meaning the students have to pay to be in marching band, and we have to do fundraisers to collect much needed money. Its like trying to run a theme park on $100 a week.

This film is a lot more interesting and profound than that. First of all it becomes personal and poignant when his own son is discovered to be 90% deaf at birth. For a musician and music teacher tbis is a tragic blow, even if Beethoven became deaf in his life. Then it shows that a good teacher is not supposed to caress the students in the smooth way of things, but he has to be both exacting and demanding on one side and on the other side helpful in the effort the students have to do to eventually come to the pleasure of becoming able to play beautiful music. And it takes a tremendous effort on the teacher's part to be that inspiring and ruthless guide who will teach rhythm and drumplaying to a black man who will die in Vietnam, sentiment and clarinet playing to the only daughter of a family who has no creative dimension, emotion and how to sing with her heart to a girl who would like to take her music teacher along with her to New York. But furthermore the film is also a vast trip from the sixties to the nineties, from Kennedy to - the unnamed - Clinton, with the Vietnam war at the back, Hair, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Nixon resigning, Ford falling when walking down from a plane, Reagan and his famous Hollywood smile, and of course the severe cuts in education in the mid-nineties that led to dropping all artistic activities from the curriculum of the school. And we could go on and on with levels of meaning that avoid mish-mash sentimentalism. And yet the end is kind of too much. How can we imagine the school, the principal and the whole community who have rejected the man at sixty without more ado than for an insignificant incident come together to unanimously present him with a farewell present that should have asked months of secret preparation ? And that present means that this Mr Holland has sacrificed all his personal and musical potential for the sake of teaching music to kids, including his composing and his musical inspiration. This leads to the saddest fact of all : education is based on a frustrating ddication from the teachers. A dedication that verges onto sacrifice, of one's own life and of one's family's life, and a frustration that stifles in the teacher what is his deepest and most insanely creative inspiration, which delivers him to retirement a hollow shell with an uncatchable ghost of a dead ambition. This film is thus very painful : as long as our school system will demand such sacrifices from its teachers it will lead to a deeply boring and frustrating education that will leave young people naked and unarmed in front of life when the real hardships of history come, and they always come back over and over again.

776004,5,6304078102,"""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest contemporary classics. This film shows how a teacher can have a tremendous impact on years' worth of students. Richard Dreyfuss is a struggling composer and musician who is ""dragged into"" teaching music at a high school. He's filled with hopes and dreams of his own, but the realities of life, large and small, affect him. Even though he has such a passion to strive for greatness of his own through composing and being a musician, his true passion comes out through his teaching. Again, truly how a teacher should be. Mr. Holland not only taught the values and essence in musical education, but the everyday, importnat values in life. He taught the values of determination and courage, like a shy and quiet girl trying her heart out to be great at playing the clarinet, or a distressed ex-football and ex-wrestler student how to play a bass drum. Simple little stuff; well, maybe not little, because as he syas ""It takes a lot of work to learn a musical instrument."" However, a little confidence and determination can go a long way. The different characters of certain students depicted in the film are just examples of how effective this teacher was. A great example is the senior girl who dreams of going to New York to become a famous singer. Mr. Holland realizes that there was truly someone who was passionate about something he could relate with. If it hadn't been for his confidence he instilled, she never would have gone on and pursued her dream. (It would have been nice to have known if she made it or not. Then again, I don't know if it's a true story, but we got to have a little imagination.) It's sad to know that because of some rotten budget, he was cut from his job along with the entire music and arts programs in the school near the end of the story. Still, even though we start to feel that it was all for what, his is a success story, as the generations and years of students who respond to his retirement, particularly the clarinet girl as she became the governor! It seems like all that drive and confidence to get to something like that all lead back to Mr. Holland. To me, there should be so many more teachers like that. Yes, ""life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,""; it's true. It was in the students that he inspired and lead to success.",1141257600,,2354,4.515222482435597
776005,5,6304078102,"Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) starts in his teaching job so he'll have more time to do his own composing.  He's going to write an opus that'll make him famous and rich.  Turns out, his students need him.  There's the clarinet player who just can't find the sound.  There's the young gifted wrestler who needs a Band credit so he won't get failed and knocked off the team.  There's the singer who needs someone to watch over her.  Before you know it, it's 30 years---and Mr. Holland discovers just what that time in school has earned him.

This is a wonderful, heartwarming tale which is also a mini-musical history lesson in itself.  The soundtrack takes you from the classical to the Kingsmen's ""Louie, Louie"", lingers lovingly over John Lennon and the impact his life and death had on so many of the Baby Boomer generation, then finally ends with a very joyful noise even as budget cuts take down the music program in Oregon schools that men like Mr. Holland worked so hard to build.

776072,5,6304078102,"This movie follows the life of a frustrated composer (played to perfection by Richard Dreyfuss) who couldn't earn a full-time living as a band member. The movie begins when he starts a new career as the music teacher at a small-town high school to pay his rent.  He quickly comes to realize it's not only high school students who don't want to be in class, but also their teachers. A succession of very unmusical students beg him to find a way to teach them, as hopeless as they appear to be, to become competent at their instruments.  This forces him to dig much deeper into the teens' psyche and his own soul to invent ways to help the teens succeed.  I found it very admirable the way he learned to control his verbal responses to kids who seemed so untalented and so far beyond the possibility of redemption. He exercised great restraint and came up with responses to them that were honest yet challenged the teens in a positive way to  discover possibilities no one would have believed they were capable of. As the parent of a teen, I can tell you this is very hard to do, and I really appreciated the lesson the movie teaches by example!  I found it very inspiring the way these experiences impacted the teens involved as they grew to adulthood and beyond, and I believe such lessons could be very impactful on junior high age students who may be struggling in one subject or another at school, and on their parents.  I'd highly recommend this film to benefit the parents of kids in the 10 to 16 years of age range, as well as to junior and senior high school teachers of any subject.

The story also shows how he inspires one very talented student, aptly played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly, to discover her inner voice and pursue her musical ambitions. To me, this film would have been worth seeing on the strength of her charming performance and beautiful singing voice alone. I think she'd make a great ingenue as Christine in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, for example, and I hope she gets that opportunity some day.  I'd also love to see and hear her opposite Josh Groban performing a musical duet, that would be magical indeed.",1110758400,2,2156,4.5244215938303345

Anyone who has ever experienced the wide range of emotions associated with children, creating something that you hope will be everlasting, or just life in general, will thoroughly enjoy this movie.

Mr. Holland struggles with his students, having no money, trying to compose his first sympony, and the later having a deaf child shows how much strength a person has and what good can come from different situations. I wasn't a big fan of classical music until I saw this movie. It truely changes my perspective one music.

I really enjoy the part in the movie with the red-head girl that can't play the clarinet. She practices everyday and always stays after school to get extra help. Just when she wanted to quit because she couldn't play, Mr. Holland made her try one last thing and it worked. I know that Mr. Holland was a great teacher because a good teacher would stay after to help and maybe change a person life without even knowing it.

776128,4,6304078102,"I just saw Mr. Holland's Opus, via BlockBuster for the FIRST TIME!, ...and I myself a musician (pianist), and raised by a dad who was in fact a ""Mr. Holland"" dad, ...the whole nine yards... My dad also a frustrated composer/high school teacher... but Dad finally got published... two of his vocal works, and before his demise his choral works had a primier performance where he was recognized locally, anyway, similarily. This movie is just ""that"" short of great. I've read several other reviews, and like them all.  But the point that Glenn Holland was a New York gigging lounge pianist BEFORE the high school gig is always skipped in the bios, and it's an important part of the plot.  _THIS_ high school teacher has just stepped down from an exiting high paced life entertaining in New York City, ...short of making it or being discovered, but nonetheless thick in the middle of the lifestyle.  THIS FACT explains WHY, when he began to make progress with his students he was so capable of using pop styles effectively, to the horror of the priniple.  He was a professional entertainer!  The typical high school music teacher is rarely so capable in this area of music!  I do agree with the negative reviews that mention, ""One more time glorifying the Beatles,"" etc. and I do agree.  The Beatles in my mind (as a musician if I may say) are highly overrated.  Decent composers but not great.  Entertainers and stylists that found a market, USA, begging for more, yes, but absolutely not... musicians on the level of Lehner and Lowe, Hammerstein, Cole Porter...  Going back to Bach or Mozart?  Not in a million years.  Same for Elvis, hate to tell you folks.  But nonetheless, The Beatles were more about the hippie movement, the long hair, the beads, the drugs.  The music is rather palid, though some of the melodies a little cute.  Nothing much more. It was more their ""aura"", less musical content.  Nothing new.  I found it a little strange for the writers to have Holland  emotionally struck about John Lennon's assasination, it doesn't really fit.  For a one time screaming teenage girl, yes.  For a seasoned, educated, working musician who knows Mozart, Beethoven---to John Coltrane??? A news item, yeah, but not an emotional loss.  Uhh,,, I say unlikely.  I agree, the orchestra sounding like the London Symphony after two practices, (which it probably was), is this Hollywood REALLY condescending to moviegoer, USA or what???  They must really think none of us know anything.  THey are always dumming down. But these observations of mine take about 2% off of a 100% 5 star movie. It's about 4.8.  There is so much good in this movie it's incredible.  The matter of the deaf son--- not an impossibility, and obviously the authors are deliberately bringing to public attention the issues of the deaf.  This part was so engaging, and tearjerking.  The youngest version of Cole, in the scene where he couldn't describe what he wanted out of the cupboard to helpless mom.  If you could watch that without welling up in tears, there's something wrong with you!  Oh that was so touching, and made a wonderful, heartwarming appeal to public awareness of the issues the deaf deal with.  So marvelously presented.  Another great part of this film.  Our hero Holland did NOT take the devil's bait!  FOR ONCE!  HURRAY HOLLYWOOD!  CAN'T BELIEVE IT! He was true to his wife, came home.  Kissed her on the cheek and said goodbye. The girl, certainly only his young teen student to start,  but also certainly, growing into womanhood, and at that point the inuendo was by all means present.  Their teacher student relationship was 100 % wholesome, to the last minute.  She was not a temptress, directly, ..not at all. She was ambitious, another young Billy Holiday.  GOin to New York City.  She dissappears from the plot right there.  Did she make it?? Who knows?  This film is overall, terrific.  Just ""that"" short of really really great, but still great.  Yes.  Good for the whole family. THe social issues of music and arts programs in schools being at/",1094256000,7,4047,4.798550724637681
776129,5,6304078102,"...this movie has recently had a profound impact on me.  I saw it in the theatre in 1996, when I was a senior in high school.  While I enjoyed it then, it is more poignant, tear-jerking and soul-enobling 8 years later as a 25-year-old.  My compliments to Hollywood for putting out a major flick whose message is that only human folly is responsible for not funding quality education of the arts for our children.

The only forgivable believability gap is that once Mr. Holland turns his teaching attitude around after his first five months, the orchestra gets TOO good, TOO quickly.  Up to January, the orchestra sounds as bad as humanly possible.  By the end of that same school year the orchestra sounds about as good as, say, the Cincinnati Youth Symphony, of which I was a member when I first saw this movie in 1996.  The Cincinnati Youth Symphony (or any Major American City, USA Youth Symphony) consists of the area's most advanced high-school-aged musicians.  These are the ones who are most likely the best player on their instrument at their local high school, regularly practice multiple hours a day and perhaps give up a certain degree of normal high-school life in order to excel on their instrument.  Regardless of how much of a ""genius"" Mr. Holland might have been at teaching, it is impossible to believe that ANY orchestra can get THAT good, THAT soon.  And in a later scene in the movie, right before Mr. Holland sings Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy,"" the school orchestra is shown playing the final coda of Beethoven's ""Eroica"" Symphony, and they sound as good as a major professional orchestra, and I myself have played that piece with PROFESSIONAL ensembles that don't sound as good as the students of JFK High!  :)  Nonetheless, this criticism does not get in the way of the main messages of the film and does not warrant the docking of any stars.

At the end, when Mr. Holland tells principal Walters that ""Cut the arts and... pretty soon these kids won't have anything to read and write about,"" it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote:  ""If we're not fighting for the arts and culture, what are we fighting for?""",1093996800,5,2131,4.708894878706199

After teaching for 30 years, he then discovers that teaching was really the correct job for him to do. He also discovers that he loved teaching for all those years even though that wasn't his first decision.
  I thought that Richard Dreyfus did a great job. I thought that the movie was very well done and I thought that the story was very heartwarming. I also think that if you loved the movie, the soundtrack might also be worth getting. I own the soundtrack and some of the songs I really like.

I am not sure I'd attend classes that begin with rhetoric like 'What is music?' but Dreyfuss does a decent job of a quasi-inspiring teacher. Although this band master could be a little less mean when returning assignments.
The acting overall in the film is pretty plain though, and the somewhat interesting premise gets old real quick.
Some scenes are even borderline idiotic. First, our supposedly great teacher expects kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be playing Mozart after one day.
Then, there is a scene where he is teaching a girl how to play her clarinet. She has been playing the thing for 3 years but still can't get out a note. He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.
Corny. Very corny.  Dreyfuss is pretty much the only thing going for this one-time rental.",1079654400,8,972,4.586206896551724
776132,4,6304078102,"This movie set up a pin and knocked it down.  It follows a rather predictable path, and the script relies too heavily on coincidences (such as the music-teacher having a deaf son) rather than character depth to make its point.  However, it was genuinely entertaining and not too far over the top to watch again.
The back of the DVD case provides an ample summary of the plot:
""(Mr. Holland) accepts a 'day job' as a high school music teacher... In time, however, Mr. Holland realizes that his real passion is teaching...""
Coming myself from Oregon, where the film was set (and filmed), I was able to feel a great deal of empathy for the budget cut issues raised in the latter part of the film.  The resulting cut of the art and music programs in the state actually occurred there, during the time when I was a student.  It has been mentioned that, perhaps, the ending was not as bright as it could have been.  However, it successfully portrayed a real problem in the modern American school system.  There's no doubt about the message this is trying to send.  Subtlety isn't a part of the film's charm.
I actually felt that most of the scenes have relevance.  The scene of the funeral for the boy killed in Vietnam was a stock moment, but at least it was mercifully brief and tasteful, rather than pouring on hokey dialogue.  It allowed Mr. Holland to make a tired point to a stoner in his class, and prove his excellent and influential teaching methods by the end of the film.
The encounter Mr. Holland had with a young singer in his school play who fell in love with him did actually add to the story.  She makes the point that he could come with her to New York and pursue the dreams he always had (and gave up when he had a child, bought a house, etc).  From the expression on Dreyfuss' face, the viewer can see that she has had an impact- that he perhaps hadn't even noticed until then that he had been simply marking time in his life, expecting it to be different ""some day"".  In the very song Mr. Holland sings for his son, there is the line ""life is what happens while you're busy making other plans"", and the scene with the singer is when he realizes that for himself.  In short, it's the character's catharsis scene- when he decides that he's actually pleased with what he has done, and what he is doing.
All this has been done before.  There's really nothing original to be found in the script or the characters.  ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is simply a fairly well-done telling of a common tale.  What makes it tolerable and, even, enjoyable, is that it mostly manages to steer clear of silly or unrealistic dialogue, even in its more overly melodramatic scenes.",1077235200,,2666,4.465979381443299
776133,5,6304078102,"I'd like to begin by saying that my rating for Mr. Holland's Opus is a 4.5.  With my love for this movie, I chose to round to five.  I think the reader deserves an explanation as to how I arrived at this number, because it's a bit unusual.  I recognize that some of the other reviewers have valid criticisms about things that were in the plot that perhaps didn't work as well as they could have, and if I graded this on that aspect alone, I'd award a 3.5.  What I gave back a full star for was the score done by Michael Kamen.  *Especially* in a film that is about music, this is integral to the experience, and I think Mr. Kamen isn't getting nearly enough credit here.  In fact, I would *very* much like to see a re-release of the DVD that, in the ""Production Notes"", will include a vastly expanded section about Michael Kamen and the process of composing the score for this movie.  Any footage they have would be much appreciated--as it is, I cannot believe just how little attention was given to him and his work.
As to the plot...I have to say, I say unashamedly that I was and still am moved by it.  I'm not going to rehash exactly what happens because many people have already done that job for me; my focus in writing this is elsewhere.  I should like to make the point that in addition to the human element of the plot, it does point out a very important problem--the diminishing of music and art programs in our schools.  In fact, Richard Dreyfuss and Michael Kamen set up the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation in an effort to help in this matter, something which I hope readers will take a look at.  I can say from my own experience that had I not had the great musical education in school that I was lucky enough to have, I would've missed out on a lot.
I only saw the movie a few times in the years since it was released, and as well as many details of the plot, the *impressions* of the music, even if not the note-for-note particulars, burned themseves indelibly upon my brain. Among my favorites are the powerful ""Iris"" theme, and the hauntingly beautiful ""Rowena"". The latter is a tune that, upon seeing the movie a few weeks ago for the first time in years, became instantly familiar the second I heard it again--I felt as if I'd found a tune I'd been seeking for all the intervening time in my own musical meanderings. That, more than anything, ought to serve as a testament to what Michael wrote here.
The ""Finale"" now has a strange parallel meaning to what it held in the movie. The music program having been cut off suddenly, the students Glenn Holland has had over the years gather to give him a glorious send-off, and to prove to him that his career, even abruptly abbreviated as it was, had a tremendous influence. That influence is the legacy of him that they will carry in their hearts. So it is now with the man who was truly behind that music--Michael Kamen passed away very suddenly on the 18th of November, 2003.  But there is no doubt that through this, and many other things, he *will* have a fantastic legacy.  I truly hope you will open your hearts to the music and the memory...to know its power and joy.

[It] continues when we see various 60's newsfootage montages intertwinded with the series of young lives Mr. Holland has touched with music including a reluctant clarinetest who grows up to be governor, and the big dumb jock, who joins the band and is later killed in Vietnam, not for the purpose of moving the story forward, but simply to steal a tear from [the] viewer...  the film addresses one real issue, when we see Dreyfus' character become distanced from his son, when it turns out he's deaf, and will never hear the music that is his father's world...  Everything about this movie is like, the idea that a screenwriter had, but decided not to use because it was just too contrived, but decided to use it anyway for whatever reason.

But as with many in life, the demands of reality force him to put aside his dream and take a job as a teacher.  He faces frustrations and disappointment in his career, family, and his music and does it with courage.  As he struggles for 30 years, with the many conflicts in his life, he is still able to share his appreciation for the art while clinging to his dream.  He touches many hearts with music, defining it's significance in our lives.  But, this isn't just about a teacher, it's about everyone, and the sacrifices made for the important things in life.  Each of us can identify ourselves in some way.  We see  how one man learns to accomplish it all, while giving back a part of himself.  And finally there is the realization of how far his talent can reach, when amazingly it is revealed who he has touched most.  It is heroism at it's most fundamental state.  This movie is about everyone who holds on to their dreams, never giving up.

He kept postponing it, in order to deal with the most pressing but small problems of life, that were never ending and in the end his dream drifted away. He gave advice to Rowena, but he did not have the courage to follow this advice himself. The second is the real meaning of success in life. Mr Holland did not become famous as a musician, but he became a great teacher and managed to be a good husband and father. What is more important?

Part of the fun of watching this movie is spotting the doses of reality that might be recognizable just to us teachers.  For example, at one point, Glenn's wife tells him to ""go ahead and write your music"" when he has missed a meeting with his son's teachers.  Glenn of course isn't writing his OWN music, but doing something for school.  Everyone who has ever taught can relate to this moment, since teachers work some insane hours (most work more in 9 months than others work in an entire year), yet often aren't recognized for this.  The parts with Rowena and dealing with clueless administrators are also very realistic.  The only thing I don't like is the schmaltzy ending, which made me want to gag.  It would be next to impossible to gather all those past students together to perform his ridiculous music.

I feel for the dilemma educators have when deciding what they should expose kids to with limited budgets, this film demonstrates that not all which is important to life can be found in the three R's (though the inaccuracy of that phrase still gets be today, but then I suppose that RWA doesn't have the same ring to it.)

Richard Dreyfuss plays a musician named Glen Holland who becomes a music teacher in 1965 in order to make a decent living for his wife, who becomes pregnant.  He goes against his will, and he really hates the job at first because his style is too dry and the students were unresponsive.  There was simply no connection between the teacher and the students.
However, Dreyfuss develops a teaching style built around how music can change one's life.  And this movie is about how each and every one of his students' lives were touched by Dreyfuss and his passion for music.
However, it is not all peaches and cream.  There are some very sad aspects to this movie.  Mr. Holland's first and only son is born deaf, which must was disappointing and heartbreaking for such a music fan as Mr. Holland.  Mr. Holland is faced with the challenge of teaching music to his deaf son.  I'm not going to give away the ending, but one moving part of this movieis the fact that even Mr. Holland's deaf son can understand the power of musicians like John Lennon.

Richard Dreyfuss does his best to make Glenn Holland, the initially reluctant but eventually dedicated teacher, believable - and a very good best it is. But in the end there are too many clichs and not enough that is true-to-life.
Above all else there is Mr Holland's ""Great American Symphony"". This is a key element of the plot because:
- His need to make money whilst he composes his masterpiece is the only reason he becomes a teacher.
- His dream that the finished symphony will enable him to become a full-time composer is what keeps him going whenever things go wrong.
- The final climax of the film centres around Mr Holland's pupils, past and present, getting together one last time to play this masterpiece on the day that Mr Holland is fired from his post.
Yet the symphony itself, when we finally get to hear it, is actually brief, vacuous, laughable, and totally unmemorable. If you've been paying attention to the plot you have to wonder how come Mr Holland himself is so unaware of his obvious lack of talent as a composer.
The second major fault in the film also appears in the final scenes.
Throughout the film Dreyfuss/Holland has regularly clashed with Vice Principal Wolters (more brilliant character acting, this time by William H. Macy), who regards the music department as a waste of time, space and money.
In the end it is Wolters who informs Holland that, due to budget cuts, the music department is to be closed and that Holland's services are no longer required. When Holland comments on how happy Wolters must be to see him go, Wolters replies:
""I care about these kids just as much as you do. And if I'm forced to choose between Mozart and reading and writing and long division, I choose long division.""
Sounds level headed, huh? But it ain't. If the script writer had actually known anything about modern teaching then he would have known that there were already a number of reputable studies in existence which show that a regular helping of classical-type music (at least once a week) will actually RAISE all-round academic performance - including in reading, writing and long division.
So what do we get? An overly long film (just under 2.5 hours) with a fairly banal plot and an ending which features the triumph of mediocrity - both in teaching methods and in the symphony.
I cannot help but imagine what it would have been like with a tighter script, a shorter running time, and an ending where the dawn of a new era of enlightened teaching was welcomed in by a genuinely creative piece of orchestral music.
Bottom line: this film is like a damp rocket, all fizz and no fire.

776249,3,6304078102,"I'm not a Richard Dreyfus fan. I rooted for the shark, and was disappointed when the aliens came in peace, so you can see why I expected to hate Mr. Holland's Opus.
And in fact, this film is a two and a half hour parade of stereotypes equaled only by the seven dwarves. It's the thinking man's Forrest Gump, and the crowning achievement of screenwriter and clich master Patrick Duncan. I rarely remember who said something first, but I can guarantee you Patrick Duncan said it last. Look for the shy student who learns self-confidence, the devoted wife who stands by her man, the dumb-but-honest kid who dies for his country, the small town kid with big city talent who risks everything for a shot at Broadway, the dedicated educators, the bureaucrats who stand in their way... lay the beans on your card and you can hit bingo before the denouement.
But wait.
I saw this film for just one reason: to see how badly they handled the Deaf character. In Hollywood, Deaf characters slide along a sorry continuum between the shy and melancholic, and the isolated and hostile, all symbolic, none bearing any similarity to any actual Deaf person I've ever met. Hearing people have no idea what Deaf people are actually like. The community of Deaf people in America is tight, it's vibrant, it's joyful, and every child born Deaf in America has this tremendous society just waiting to embrace it. But this isn't common knowledge among hearing America, who can only imagine themselves, suddenly cut off auditorily from the world they know, and so they project this onto characters they don't know, and create a sad stereotype with no basis whatsoever in reality.
Anyway, so I walked into Mr. Holland's Opus already composing in my head the nasty things I could say in a review, but lo, this film-- once I found a poison ivy ointment that actually worked, and the relief I felt when the itching immediately subsided, THAT is how I felt watching this film. The Deaf kid is funny, bright, fights with his parents, and likes cars and science. Among all the symboloids that cross this film, the Deaf kid is the only real, three dimensional person. That has a lot of bearing on the actual lives of actual Deaf people.
Since I was working as a sign language interpreter at the time, people kept asking me ""Have you seen Mr. Holland's Opus?"" and I'd say ""Yes,"" and then they'd say ""How realistic is it that this kid has a musician father? How many Deaf people have parents like Mr. Holland?""
And I'd answer ""All of them.""
Seriously. Take a guy who listens to news in his car, who doesn't own a CD player, tell him his child is Deaf, and suddenly he's weeping that junior will never hear the melodious strains of ""Mozart."" He pronounces it to rhyme with ""Beaux arts.""
So Glen Holland is the symbolic, universal parent-of-Deaf-child. This time around hearing people are the symbols, and the Deaf kid is the one who is real.

And then the bad:  It's Hollywood, and it's cheesy.  All of us who have struggled with a musical instrument know that you don't really get THAT MUCH better by ""playing the sunset.""

Like, for instance, the ""hero"" hurries desperately through the wrong-way street to the hospital so he can see his ""beautiful, precious, and perfect"" little baby boy...only to suddenly find him not only hearing-impaired (aw, how can he enjoy music?!), but he also grew into a rebellious brat to boot. And what's more, his sweet, sweet little wifey-wife also seems to be blissfully unaware of the fact her beloved, devoted husband had messed around a bit with some long-maned vixen who had came to him for advice in singing and eventually became a successful singer headed for New York, all thanks to his unselfish urging and support. And he gets to kiss her thick, luscious quivering lips in sincere gratitude. How sweet! And in the very end, all the devotion and obsession the ""hero"" has for music (he's afraid the whole civilization will come to an end if it doesn't maintain its interest in classical music) all comes down to his very last waving of a stick before a musical group of students who had been in his classes a long ago before he retires forever.

You don't want to be at a video store with my mother.

She's the one who picked out this film.
Originally, I turned it down and rented something else. But after those movies were returned, my mom showed up at home after work with this movie in tow. My sister and I watched it, now I realize what an excellent work it is.
This movie is found in the drama section, so if you don't like weepy films, don't rent this. You should also see this before you see another of Richard Dreyfuss' movies, the comedy Krippendorf's Tribe, because if you see that first, your viewing of him as a music teacher will be influenced by your viewing of him in a grass skirt.

776314,5,6304078102,"Richard Dreyfuss plays a musician and composer, Glenn Holland, whose ambition is to write an opus that will be his gift to the world. Unfortunately, such dreams don't pay the rent and utilities, so Holland is forced to take a job as a music teacher in the local high school until his legacy is composed and put to music. However, as is so often the case because of unforeseen circumstances, the stopgap job becomes permanent. In Holland's case, the critical event is the unplanned pregnancy of his wife Iris, played by Glenne Headley, and the subsequent birth of a son. So, a year or two becomes three decades, and, in the end, Holland faces the realization that his legacy is of a different sort than originally envisioned.
Filmed in and around Portland, Oregon, OPUS defines Holland through his relationships: his long-suffering wife, his paternally neglected son (ironically born with a significant impairment), the happy-go-lucky gym teacher (played wonderfully by Jay Thomas), the crusty school principal, the weasely vice-principal, and the phenomenally talented student (played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly) who, unlike Holland, has the determination to act on her own dream now.
The movie's conclusion is pure schmaltz. However, it works, I think, because the audience has long since conceded Holland's contribution to the young lives he's touched, and because there's maybe a little of Holland in each of us. How many can truly say that they've realized the dreams of their youth, much less been of usefulness to the community, rather than living lives of quiet desperation.

Yeah, this hard-core ""macho"" geek was moved to cry at  the end, when the Gov shows up at the recital. So shoot me. It's STILL a  great flick, even if it isn't John Wayne or Star Wars (wow, there's a  combination...nahhhh).",968112000,2,814,4.4324324324324325
776317,5,6304078102,"Recent showing of ""Music of My Heart"" starring Merryl Strepp as a substitute teacher striving to sustain a violin program for low-income  kids in New York City reminds me of this all-time favorite classic released  back in 1996.  The bottom line is love.
Situated in Oregon in the fall of  1964, Glen Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) took up a job as a high school music  teacher as his wife became pregant.  Holland, now shouldered with added  responsibility as a soon-to-be father, a composer, and a teacher, faced the  immediate challenge of working with a diverse group of students:  the  naturally talented, the rebellious, and the physically impaired.
This  is a movie about love and love of music.  Glenn Holland is the central  figure who strives to love his students and family through his devotion to  music.  Born deaf-toned, the dream of teaching his own son to become an  eminent violinist inevitably bursts with much frustration.  Glenn Holland  is not perfect; in fact, interactions with his students through failures  and triumphs gradually refine him to be a loving and well-respected man.  Love propels him to reconcile his frustration for his son and breaks the  ice in his relationship with his wife.
For over 30 years, this young  composer has taught generations of students not only about music, but love,  respect, faith, and confidence.  The final reunion of his students features  orchestration of ""American Symphony"" to pay the highest tribute  to this self-sacrificing teacher.
This is a movie that will move every  soul and make everyone's tears roll down the cheek.  It's all about love,  and love moves.  After 4 years since I first watched the premiere, it still  touches my heart and brings tears to my eyes when I see it again on my  flight to Asia.",967766400,86,1776,4.915254237288136
776318,5,6304078102,"I love this movie.  I really do.  On January 19, 1996 it opened in theaters across the country and people gave it a standing ovation at the theater where I saw it.  This movie set a precedent for me -- I saw it 5  times in the theater, something I have never done before.  I REALLY LOVE  IT.
The movie starts out in the 1964-1965 school year.  Mr. Glen Holland  (Richard Dreyfus) plays a musician forced to table his musical career for  economic reasons.  His wife is pregnant and he has to find stable work.  An  opening for a music teacher at the former Grant High School (now Kennedy)  in Oregon has become available.  Mr. Holland applies for and gets the  job.
Reluctant to put his dream on the back burner, Mr. Holland enters  the classroom.  He is confronted with an array of students ranging from  naturally talented to tone deaf.  After initially getting nowhere with his  pupils, Mr. Holland tries a new approach.  He encourages them to talk about  the music they like and uses this as a way of establishing an interest in  music.  One young clarinetist catches his attention and he works 1x1 with  the girl, extracting hard work and talent for her.  He helps her find her  voice. He tells her that he can ""teach her music and notes on the  page,"" but as for ""all that other stuff,"" he cannot teach.  It has to be felt.  ....
The movie does an excellent  and convincing job of covering a three-decade time span.  One of my  favorite scenes was when Mr. Holland borrowed the Driver's Ed class' 1965  Dodge Coronet (an especially cool car) and drove it like the proverbial bat  ...
The movie is really about love.  Love for music, love for  people and love for the best people have to offer.  The high school coach  who befriends Mr. Holland early in his teaching career helps him work with  his pupils in marching band drills.  The coach also helps the  administration continue their tradition of hosting school shows....

I have to say I like the movie,  but the DVD has to be the poorest picture quality I have ever watched, even  on the small screen, the flicker an fuzz was awful..My advice buy the tape.",964569600,,446,4.091954022988506
776350,5,6304078102,"Few movies have touched me as much as this one. It is about how priorities get in the way of dreams. Eventually with time, those dreams become unattainible. This is the heart of the movie.
Mr. Holland (magnificently  played by Richard Dreyfuss) yearns to be a composer, but get's stuck  teaching music at a local high school. Like most of us he gets trapped  there, in a place where he doesn't want to be. Once more, his son is deaf,  leaving Mr. Holland to believe that his own son will never understand his  passion: music. Mr. Holland eventually grows to love his job. He influences  and inspires quite a few people there. Unfortunately, the music program is  cancelled because of budget cuts. Mr. Holland, left jobless believes his  efforts were futile, and his life wasted. He soon learns that he achieved a  sucess far beyond his wildest dreams.",963964800,4,851,4.695945945945946

This movie is a tribute to those that have devoted their lives to passing their love of  music to those who could pass it on to their children. Teachers have always  been underappreciated in our society and whether you were influenced by a  music teacher or a teacher of any subject, this movie will make you want to  go out and thank them. There are many Mr. Hollands out there. For me, Mrs  Greene, Dr. Smith, Mrs Keenan, Mrs Thornton and Mrs Howlett are teachers  who influenced my life.

776352,4,6304078102,"The heart-warming tale of a composer-to-be turned High School Music Teacher.  With Richard Dreyfuss (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") in the leading role, the story spans a 30 year time period in  the changed life of the teacher. The story is one most of us can relate to  as we try to achieve our hopes and dreams.  If we only realize the lives we  are truly touching.  The movie offers some unique transitions between the  years including archived film footage and real-life events that changed our  nation.  While not based on a true story, it certainly could be.  The only  issue friends had with the movie was the speed with which the non-musical  high school became an overnight sensation.  Considering the fact the movie  covers such an expanse of time, one's imagination must be employed to lay  the timeline.  Good supporting cast, mostly newcomers with the exception of  Olympia Dukakis (the Principal) and that guy that played that Car Salesman  in ""Fargo"".",959299200,2,973,4.865030674846626
776353,5,6304078102,"""Mr. Holland's Opus"" takes the viewer on a journey through the life of a young musician (played by Dreyfuss) and his family.  When pregnancy enters the picture the couple decides that, for the present, life  on the road is not a good idea while the baby is on the way.  He then  accepts a position as a High School music teacher, just to make ends meet,  and to give him time to compose.  Then real life hits...
In the end it is  teaching, not performing, that defines Mr. Holland's life.  He is faced  with personal and family challenges, motivated and ambivalent students,  turbulent social times, and the continuing desire to compose...but there  never seems to be enough time to do everything.
This is an excellent  movie!  The acting is wonderful, and the story is compelling and  believable.  And the sound track is great.
This movie is a triubute to  the human spirit, and to the effect dedicated teachers can have on lives of  their students.  It deserves nothing less than 5 stars.
If you haven't  watched this movie, do yourself a favor and give it a look.  If, however,  your movie tastes are driven by action, adventure, high-tech special  effects, etc., then this movie may not be for you.
To all the teachers  out there -- of music and everything else -- THANK YOU!

Every aspect comes across as being carefully chosen-- the way the characters age through the movie, the emotion between various people, the lessons that are learned, the music  that is scored-- everything fits together perfectly to make this movie one  of the best I have ever seen.",958953600,,319,4.981132075471698
776355,5,6304078102,"This is a great flick. After seeing the movie in the theatre, we later rented the video. After viewing the video, we bought our own copy!
I suppose part of the movie is patterned after ""It's a wonderful  Life"" but that was a good movie, too.
All the characters in this  movie have great depth and are multi-faceted. And it's a movie that  reminded me of how much we ask of our educators and teachers.
And I  think most folks can identify with the lead character. Who really feels  100% certain that they are living thir life to its fullest potential? Mr.  Holland is plagued with doubts that he has wasted his life, but when he  takes a few steps backwards and looks over the landscape of his life, he  sees his life was immeasurably successful.
I loved it. I loved every  moment of it. It's a spiritual movie with a deep and profound message that  as long as we are ""every day, in every way getting better and  better"" we are on the right path.",956793600,3,945,4.3125
776356,3,6304078102,"Good quality movie and fine acting.  It is a tribute to teaching and the joys thereof.  That is one message.
Another message is one of selfishness.  Holland is surrounded by selfcentered people who expect him  to give up his dream to create.  What kind of family is that?  Leonard  Bernstein had a family and still created and to the continued joy of the  music world.  Bach had 20 children and still created. I'll bet both men had  supportive wives.  Holland did delay his composition and it was only  partially written.  Many of the students he helped, who eventually became  powerful, paid tribute after he lost his job by playing his unfinished  opus.  Isn't that wonderful?  Here the man is put out to pasture after  sacrificing his dream and he gets a pat on the back.  His wife smiles and  his son loves him again. Do his powerful and grateful former students help  him? No.  In the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" The people who  were helped and even saved came forward and saved the day for the desperate  hero. In Mr. Holland's Opus they really turned their backs on him and sugar  coated it by playing his composition.",955584000,,1127,4.570707070707071
776357,5,6304078102,This is one of those movies where it finishes and I just sat there with amazement on how good it was.  Anyone who cannot understand that just because it is not an action movie it can't be good because this movie is  the best movie.  I also recommend: Shanshank Redemption.,954806400,2,272,4.4
776358,1,6304078102,"This is a cinematic tribute to the teaching profession rendered in a style reminiscent of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but without any angels. Mr. Holland is a musician whose real heart is in composing. At  first he sees teaching music appreciation in a high school as a way to put  food on the table for his young family - and allow for spare time"" to  compose. He soon learns how demanding teaching can be - and ultimately  discovers through the passage of time how rewarding it can be as well.  Well, for anyone who is or has been a teacher of any kind - and can handle  the cloying sentimentality of this stink bomb - the movie might be worth  the seemingly interminable 142 minutes.
There is a lot to be said for  understatement, but Steven Herek doesn't seem to think the American  movie-going public is sophisticated enough to catch the subtle hints that  that entails. We get bonked over the head with newsreels - Lyndon Johnson's  voice emerges inexplicably to tell us we are in the Vietnam era, one stop  along the way in the tumultuous times of Mr. Holland - and the signposts  keep coming till we find him in the present, convincingly aged. (The  make-up is the singularly impressive feature of this film.) Victim of the  perennial jostling of education priorities for budgetary reasons, Mr  Holland finds that his services are no longer required. An extravagant  surprise farewell party is held for him in the school auditorium with  everyone but the President and the Pope there to tell him what a difference  he had made in their lives. To conclude matters, it had been arranged that  the composition he had been working on all these years would make its world  premiere under the unrehearsed baton of the composer himself, much to his  surprise and delight. Thankfully, the movie does not go on to show us how  Mr Holland has an accident or finds himself with a fatal heart condition to  prolong our embarrassment in this tale that aims for the heart, but  collides with the digestive tract.
There are some interesting ironies and  issues dealt with this movie. Here is Mr. Holland, a music teacher, whose  only son is deaf. Here is Mr. Holland the dedicated professional who is so  immersed in helping other people that he has neglected his own family. Here  is Mr. Holland, the man, who has been tempted to run off with one of his  pupils - an adoring and talented beauty. Every aspect of the teaching  psyche is addressed, from the sense of public duty to the suppression of  the most private passions - all well and good. But what do we get instead?  A movie that is almost a parody of itself.
Movie's worst moment for me  was surely where Dreyfuss as Holland sings John Lennon's ""Beautiful  Boy"" to his son in front of a large audience of deaf college students.  He had had a falling out with his boy and this was his attempt - a  successful one - at making amends. The director tries to push too many  buttons with this scene, however, as Lennon had just been slain at this  time. There is also the point to be made that deaf people do possess an  ability to appreciate music and musicians, thank you. Again, important  messages, but they are so sugar-coated you find yourself looking for a  toothbrush in the middle of the flick.
If overly sentimental movies with  inordinately lavish soundtracks don't bother you, then by all means this is  a movie for you. (Most of the reviewers here are obviously  happy with  that kind of flick.) If they do bother you, forget it. If for some reason  you find yourself watching this because there's no way out, you may need a  six-pack or two to deaden the pain.",954201600,21,3633,4.568322981366459

776390,5,6304078102,"The quality of Mr. Holland's Opus spreads evenly throughout its plot, its message, and its marvelous appreciation of music and the arts.  In fact, this movie delivers both definition and demonstration of music appreciation  as a whole, absent of selective bias.  Devoid of senseless killings,  violence, or notable language, Opus is a family movie without the corny  overtones.  For many it's a tearjerker.
But Mr. Holland's Opus unfolds an  issue.  It is a simple plea for an increase in music appreciation among  society--particularly our young people.  Mr. Holland's career is pressured  more and more by the gradual, yet perpetual governmental cuts in school  funding for the arts amid the US.  In sharp contrast, the movie makes it  clear that support for the sports programs in public schools remain firm  and solid.  Careful to avoid cursing this predicament or hurling insults  toward society, this message is rather Hollywood's way of calmly saying,  ""Take a look,"" using the common life of an otherwise forgotten  music teacher.
The central beauty of the movie is in the character of  Mr. Holland himself.  He is an ardent yet sensible lover of music.  The  viewer will find no arrogance or snootiness in Mr. Holland.  It's not his  style.  Instead, Holland's concern for the progressive loss of interest in  the arts is voiced simply, directly, and peacefully.
The movie delivers  a powerful message through ordeals within his family.  Struggling with the  hardships of common fate (and some not so common), Holland learns new  depths of love and companionship from both his wife and son.  He is a man  of emotions like anyone else.  He looses his temper on occasions.  But Mr.  Holland is always in control of himself.  He deals with pressures to the  best of his ability as they occur.
Mr. Holland is a believable person.  The viewer is free to place him into society with the rest of the world and  to walk in his shoes for a spell.  A superb job from the entire cast of  characters, the journey is emotionally rewarding.",947894400,33,2035,4.899408284023669
