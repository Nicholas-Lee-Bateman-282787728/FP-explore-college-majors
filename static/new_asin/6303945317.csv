740467,5,6303945317,"After 'Dark Star', this was Carpenter's first proper mainstream motion picture. It wasn't a hit in America (people complained that the thought of  a street gang being armed with sniper rifles was unrealistic) although it  was extremely popular in the punk-gripped UK. Looking at Carpenter's later  work, this is possibly his best film. It has a minimalist purity -  everything about the film is pared down to the absolute minimum, in exactly  the way that 'Star Trek : The Motion Picture' is not. With a tiny budget  there was no room for lengthy special effects sequences, and Carpenter  himself directed, edited, and wrote the hip-hop, Bomb the Bass-influencing  electronic soundtrack. Most of the budget went into the hiring of  Panavision cameras, as Carpenter realised that you could cut much faster if  you had a wider screen. And after a long build-up, Carpenter does just  that, in a series of short, intense action sequences which take place  mostly in the dark. Despite the cars and haircuts it hasn't dated all that  badly, and it's still worth a look nowadays.
Note that both the video and  DVD boxes are awful, one giving the impression that the film is 'Maniac  Cop', and the other giving the impression that the film is 'Big Trouble in  Little China'.",966384000,2,1266,4.873239436619718
740468,5,6303945317,"Assault On Precint 13 is a great remake of Rio Bravo. Carpenter creates a suspenseful work of art about an L.A. gang attacking a run down precint in the hood. Great performances, good soundtrack and Carpenter's great  direction add up to make this an action classic. I rank this up there with  The Thing, Halloween and Escape From New York as Carpenter's best films.  A  must have.",951177600,,381,4.641791044776119
740469,5,6303945317,"John Carpenter's greatest movie, in my opinion, tells the story of a precinct under siege by an L.A. street gang willing to fight to the death. The group being attacked is composed of one police officer, a pair of  secrataries, a pair of inmates, and the man that caused the gang to  concentrate their rage on this run-down precinct.  You find yourself on the  edge of your seat, forgetting that these people are actors.  Especially  great performance by Darwin Joston as Napolean Wilson, the wise-cracking  serial killer.  Whether you prefer action, westerns, horror, or suspense,  you are guaranteed to love this movie.",929318400,2,621,5.009803921568627

Now there's this review thing asking how I feel.  What I didn't like was that the nomenclature (at least for me) wasn't clear.  In the past when I have ordered DVDs it's clearly understood what I'm getting.  There was something ambiguous about this that caused me to order the wrong thing (download).  I may try again some time later to see if there is a DVD for the earlier version Assault On Precinct 13 - not the one with Lawrence Fishburn.

740569,5,6303945317,"May contain spoilers

John Carpenters, ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is a low budget tense and captivatingly resolute in its delivery. Carpenter's film was loosely based on an update of Rio Bravo. It ranks as a cult action classic and one of the filmmaker's best. It is a complex film, though it is not really about anything more intricate than a chill down the spine. A lot of its unnerving power comes from the kind of inexplicable, almost paranormal happenings, which one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort. In fact, there is not much more to the plot than that. This film is all about attitude and atmosphere.

The narrative is of two parts as we see one side of that plot, it has a message; explicitly that violence precipitates violence. It is rather telling that the director seems to disfavor the LAPD. When you contemplate that, the whole chain of events is generated by a combination of triggers. The situation here whereby, six, gang members are coldly gunned down by faceless police officers. Then we have the other side of the narrative. This is about a small group of people who find themselves confined to an old run down Police station, which to all intense and purpose is closed and decommissioned. We have a newly qualified CHP police officer (The CHP has patrol jurisdiction over all California highways and can also act as the state police), a couple of secretaries, some prisoners and other civilians  who find themselves besieged in a precinct station on the edge of a rather desolate looking Los Angeles slum. What makes the film so effective is that the attackers seem to be as mindless (or very single-minded in their pursuit of an injured man), and relentless, as with zombies  except they are adept at using semi-automatic weapons with silencers.

If the movie is really about anything at all, it is about methods of urban warfare and defense. Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement makes his early work so very riveting, add to this his amazing OST, then is an indie film with steroids.",1488585600,2,2125,4.747967479674797
740570,1,6303945317,Seriously? What the cops think is rain on their car is blood dripping from a dead guy? Guys climbing through the he windows try to go through the Venetian blinds rather than lift them up? A shotgun fires one shell and there's two sounds? A guys daughter is shot and he responds by covering her with his coat then driving away after a car he's never seen before? I can't find anything in this movie to even remotely seem plausible.,1487462400,,430,4.3875
740571,5,6303945317,"I like this movie a lot. I love some john carpenter movie, but last time i watch this the audio had kind of lip-syncing problem.

740601,5,6303945317,"Like it says on the box - a cross between Rio Bravo and Night of the Living Dead. Probably could not make this movie now, despite the fact that the ethnic backgrounds of the bad guys are all diverse. Love the low key performances by the main trio. Also love the fact that the heroes try to do what a normal person would try to do - like try and get help! If I am ever trapped in a building surrounded by an army of gun toting malcontents, I want Austin Stoker on my team. Surprised at how fast the movie goes once it gets started. By todays standards, the violence may seem pretty tame or even low key but it was something back in the day. Also has an awesome soundtrack.",1485561600,11,671,4.090909090909091
740602,5,6303945317,"Saw ""Assault On Precinct 13"" the other day, and that made a pretty good backdrop for inauguration day.
Just watched ""Jackson County Jail"" and it still fits too.
The situation the (american) world is in, is, for quite a lot people, still the same as in '76: living in and travelling on or going to desolation row. And no matter if you are staying in place or moving fast: violence will get you. But today violence is not only about guns, violence is in words and violence is an attitude. The word becomes a weapon when you are abusing it, p. o. t. u. s.
Hope, that all won't end up in the deadly fog of unprecise words and foggy speech and hazy action, p. o. t. u. s.
Tomorrow I will watch ""The Fog"". -

""Assault ..."" is a perfect example for the american nightmare: a violent society in violating cities, a society infected with guns, a society which has no cure for the infection with the disease of gun-crazyiness of the mind and the heart and the dna of a whole people. It shows, that the state of the union is still (after forty more years): devastation in the society, desolation in the cities, which means a violent soil on which grows the plant named ""violence"" fertilized by guns (and often a wrong attitude).  can't protect you from violence ""Assault ..."" is a perfect example for the american dream  where the attitude of the individual changes everything. The attitude of a good black police officer - no cop: a gentleman in the uniform of a police offic er - , the attitude of a white death row candidate, which is still a human being and shows it, the attitude of a real, a hot woman, but she is is not only a woman and hot but also courageous, smart, tough and extremely cool. Together and with respect for each other and an attitude you can deal with almost any situation (under siege). It's the togetherness of the black police officer, the white death row candidate and the sexual attractive and cool and tough woman which makes the difference under the siege/assault of precinct 13). ""E pluribus unum"" (means imho: very different individuals with an attitude forming the great all american nation) says the seal of the president of the united states of america (and you have to remember this to, Mr. new and inaugurated and bias-infected P.O.T.U.S.)",1484870400,,2267,4.537897310513447

All hell breaks loose outside and the cop Sgt Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) and his charge, Marion Bishop (Lawrence Fishburne) make it to the precinct before it's overrun.  The downside?  The ""all hell"" outside is NY's finest.

This is a remake.  Quite often either too many changes are made in the name of artistic discretion or it stays the same yet ISN'T the same.  Neither is the case.  The action is very good.  Violent, but good.  That characters have time to flesh out.  Beck's vs Smiley's thoughts on life.  Beck wants to go out in a blaze of glory.  Smiley wants to survive to love another day.

740744,5,6303945317,"After Police ambush and kill several Los Angeles street thunder Gang members, the four rival gang warlords come together and make a blood pact to avenge their fallen members. War has been declared, its open season on anyone carrying a badge. While travelling with her father, a young girl wanders off to buy ice cream from an ice cream vendor. The young girl crosses paths with the four warlords and she is killed by the white warlord. Her father chases after her assailants and guns down the white warlord. The father is now being hunted by the remaining warlords and he runs for help to a neighboring police station which is all but abandoned and scheduled to be closed the next morning.

The man babbling incoherently is taken into the protection of the police precinct. For the unsuspecting staff of the closing precinct the gauntlet has been laid down, they just don't know it yet. Out manned and out gunned by the L.A. gangs, a tiny group of police officers and several convicts will have to come together if they want to survive. Welcome to the 1976 cult classic Assault on Precinct 13

Wow! What can I say about Shout! Factory. I read that their Blu-ray release of Assault on Precinct 13 is sourced from the same 1080p high definition master used for the Image Blu-ray released in 2008, but this one looks and sounds much better in my opinion. The video transfer appears to be clearer and brighter on the Shout Blu-ray release. As for the sound, I played it through my home theater system and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sounded excellent. Id rate the picture quality at a solid 4.5/5 and the sound at 4/5. In my opinion this is an excellent Blu-ray offering from Shout! Once again their disc packaging with reversible slip cover and disc artwork is top notch.

740934,1,6303945317,"To start with, let me just make it clear that I'm aware that this was John's earlier movie predating ""Halloween"", of course.  So it's clear that he was just getting started on something else after his other unwatchable trainwreck Dark Star,  and one can give him a break at that point.  Looking back though there is just nothing impressive about this movie and it just can't be defended in terms of its content.

Let's start with its pacing:  It's just way too slow and plodding to do anything but give the audience a restful sleep.  Now as for the general plot however, well it's also dull as well as very simple-minded,  inconsistent, highly crude and mean-spirited, to say nothing of pointless by any standard.

The villains were far too boring and one-dimensional in the most literal sense of the term.  The problem is not only don't they say one word the whole time but, they are also nameless,  too mysterious, low on motive,  and don't seem to have a leader either. It was also ridiculous how they kept growing in numbers in a matter of just a few minutes similar to how the Gremlins did.  I realize that this movie comes before Gremlins but I'm just saying. Some charisma for the villains wouldn't have hurt.

The special effects are so obviously fake. Is it even a little bit possible to suspend disbelief?  The sound effects for the gunfire are so corny that they all sound like Looney Tunes and old western movie sound effects.

The main characters Bishop, Napoleon, and Leigh are barely well developed characters and the actors performances were all unsettlingly wooden performances to the point where they may as well have termites chew on them.  Who would notice anyway?

Furthermore,  that  scene where the killer with the blonde hair shoots and kills a cute little girl was  completely atrocious,  very offensive, just unnecessary in general, really disturbing, and to boot highly unacceptable!  What was Mr. Carpenter looking to do, make this movie exploitative?!

While he did cast both Charles Sheriff Brackett Cyphers  and Nancy Loomis( both from Halloween a couple of years later) they hardly had  any real part in it.  To make matters worse,  Nancys character was so unbearably annoying.

This movie also had intolerably corny one-liners such as:  Thats enough to grow hair on a rock.  What does that even mean and who talks like that!  Another one is: You look like somebody just spit in your socks.  Give me a break what the hell kind of lines are these?!

It was also ridiculous when the lovely Leigh gets shot in the arm and shows no reaction of pain!  Why was she being so damn stoic for?  Also, what is with most of the people who get shot showing few or no bullet holes.  Is it really necessary to show the audience that this is just a movie?

In closing this movie is just one far too exploitative, super boring, mean-spirited, pointless, and utterly characterless waste of time.  If this was my first John Carpenter movie I think I would have felt that Halloween was going to be no kind of improvement direction wise.  Its a good thing that I saw this and Dark Star much later. The true assault is on the audience that expects any sort of entertainment out of this total trainwreck!  For any John Carpenter fan I would say that Assault on Precinct 13 is a definite must miss.",1408492800,2,3306,4.6522491349480966
740935,5,6303945317,"I finally saw this and really enjoyed it. It was one of the few John Carpenter movies I'd not seen (it was his second, after ""Dark Star""), and it's interesting to see how this film set the stage for, ""Halloween"" two years later. An excellent example of indy, low-budget filmmaking.",1406678400,,281,4.64
740936,5,6303945317,"Maybe not the best movie in the world but Classic John Carpenter.  If you're a John Carpenter fan then you need this flick in your collection.  Perhaps one of the memorable scenes (shocking) is when adorable little Kim Richards returns her ice cream and states, ""I ordered Vanilla Swirl...""  The rest of that shot....  well I'll leave that for you to see for yourselves.",1406505600,,370,4.734375
740937,5,6303945317,"One of the funniest, darkest and most tense action movies I have seen, it is also one that has sadly fallen below the radar, overshadowed by Carpenter's later work and some of the action greats that would come out a few years later.
Assault on Precinct 13 does the impossible. It is an action film that is very exciting, but at the same time very subtle. In some ways even more subtle than the films it pays tribute too, namely Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo.
The movie tells the story of three great characters, classic good guy cop Lt. Bishop, very much molded on the John Wayne archetype, made more interesting by him being portrayed by black actor Austin Stoker. a risky move for Carpenter but a wise choice. He is the man with the smile, the selfless hero, the lover and not the fighter who takes up arms to defend the helpless, and himself.
Next we have Napoleon Wilson, a cold but charismatic murderer who takes up arms to help defend the police station. He spouts many of the film's most memorable lines, and shows a clear knowledge of how the enemy thinks, making him very invaluable.
Finally, we have Leigh, the calm and stoic secretary who remains collected and keeps her wits about her the entire ordeal. An overlooked female action hero, Leigh is the brains of the group, using her knowledge of the building to help the group formulate plans, but still picks up a gun whenever she is needed to. She never misses.
The villainous street gang is portrayed in a very unique way. They have three lines of dialogue, all done in the first five minutes. Afterwards they don't say a word, and after the forty minute mark, we are no longer treated to close ups. They become a mass of people moving in oddly synchronized motions, hardly making a sound as they shoot from the treeline. This would become a staple of later Carpenter films when he makes his villains as un-characterized as possible. There are no characters in the gang. The gang itself is the character.
In spite of its low budget, the film had many great action scenes. Silenced guns laying a barrage of gunfire on the police station, man after man climbing through the windows to attack, two cars facing off like a showdown in the old west, and the final tense fight in the hallway. But what really makes this movie work are the characters. Since we come to care about them so much, we want nothing more than to see them ride out the storm. The more action films focus on character, such as with Raiders and Die Hard, the more worthwhile the action is. Even though this action is minimalist, the characters make it all the more rewarding.
And for the record, no. I am not a grumpy old man pining for the 'good old days' of cinema. I am 25 years old and there are plenty of movies that come out nowadays that I think are excellent. But at the same time, I feel it is foolish to not watch a movie based on its age.
Carpenter's film does show its age, but like a bottle of wine. It only gets better as the years go by.",1406419200,6,2976,4.422586520947177
740938,5,6303945317,"It's not that the 2005 remake was that sucky; I actually didn't mind it. It's just that John Carpenter's original Assault on Precinct 13, out in 1976, was such a synergy of inspired guerrilla filmmaking, unexpectedly iconic characterization, and a hell of an unnerving peek at what happens when rational thinking crumbles to be replaced by relentless, faceless anarchy.

John Carpenter's insidious 5-note synth score from jump induces them shivers. It alerts us to a hellish Saturday night going down in Anderson, mean ghetto in South Central Los Angeles. Carpenter - who also wrote, edited, and directed - rolls with the slow burn approach, the better to invest us in the cast. Three plot threads eventually intersect:

Newly-promoted Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), embarking on his first night on duty as Police Lieutenant, is temporarily assigned to Anderson's nearly deserted Precinct 9 (Division 13) to oversee its final transitioning to its new location. Bishop, working with a skeleton crew, is informed that the phones and electricity are scheduled to be shut down the following morning at 10am. We come to find, someone jumps the gun.

Regard Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) as a precursor to Snake Plissken but with a better sense of humor. Wilson is a prisoner condemned to Death Row. He and two other inmates are awaiting transport to Sonora. Before the bus rolls up, we're given enough character-building notes re Napoleon to get a sense of the sort of badass hombre he is. He exudes great presence.

Meanwhile, a man and his daughter find themselves way out of their neighborhood (something about fetching the babysitter). They end up lost, driving around in Anderson, getting the hairy eyeball from one of South Central's more malevolent criminal elements. This plot thread would eventually demonstrate why vanilla twist is such an inimical ice cream flavor. In fact the infamous ice cream scene almost got the film smacked in the face with an MPAA X rating for the explicit violence that goes down.

This movie is essential viewing for anyone tracing the progression of John Carpenter as a filmmaker. Assault on Precinct 13 was only his second film, if you count his shoestring student sci-fi flick, Dark Star (1974), as his first. It's no secret that Assault on Precinct 13 - which, by the way, should've been titled Assault on Precinct 9 - takes its cues from Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Once the slow burn approach runs its course, once the three arcs meld together, once the characters converge at the precinct, the thriller aspects really ramp up.

I saw this years ago and was blown away by how good it was, given how new to the scene Carpenter was. I admire his execution under the duress of a shoestring budget and (more or less) a two week shoot. It's seminal in that it's here that Carpenter learned he could make a terrific, gritty film on the cheap even as he injected his trademark odd and sometimes cryptic touches.

Part of what makes it such an unsettling watch is that the precinct is besieged by flitting shadows and nebulous figures. We know they're gang members. But they never speak, they're impassive to an inhuman degree, and when one of them falls, there's always another one to promptly take his place. It's as if an implacable hive mind were at work. This ferocious singlemindedness and the absence of dialogue (even their weapons have silencers) feed into this spine-tingling effect, the terrifying faceless face of urban anarchy.

Carpenter draws enough emotion and vitality out of his cast that you should never mind that these actors are essentially a bunch of ""Who's that?"" The three leads are very effective: Stoker as the virtuous lawman, Joston as the wry, enigmatic Death Row inmate, and Laurie Zimmer as the unfazed station secretary Leigh. She's one more nod to those classic Hawksian westerns, the lovely, gutsy dame who gives as good as she gets. When she and Joston begin flirting with their doomed romance - ""It's an old story with me. I was born out of time."" - it sparks one of the film's most rewarding sub-plots.

I didn't even realize it until I got done watching it, but it is so refreshing when the lead character is played by a black actor, and guess what? No one refers to his skin color. That's cool. What matters is that Austin Stoker imbues the Lieutenant with understated professionalism and that, when it counts, he rallies his embattled group.

But, hands down, my favorite - and probably everyone's favorite - is Napoleon Wilson, that wisecracking hardcase always bumming for a smoke. One floating theory is that Napoleon - who nurses his own harsh code of morals - asks everyone for a smoke to gauge a person's character by their response. It's a neat character note, anyway, and Darwin Joston - who happened to be Carpenter's neighbor at the time - injects surprising humanity into this convicted killer. Okay, enough, this is a nerve-wracking powder keg of a cult classic of a movie. And you should check it out. This is the one that really got Carpenter's confidence going, that cemented his style and craft. And, lookie lookie, his ensuing film is universally hailed as an all-time horror masterpiece. No, I don't mean the television movie, Elvis... or don't I?",1405209600,2,5280,4.8828125

740940,3,6303945317,There are a lot of things that John Carpenter would change about this film if he were to make it now. Most notably the killing of the innocent girl towards the beginning of the movie (something he actually said). What is most important about Assault on Precinct 13 is that it is solid and successful independent filmmaking that led to his more developed style later on. In a lot of ways Assault on Precinct 13 is just classic 70's cinema on a smaller budget.,1400025600,,458,4.464285714285714
740941,5,6303945317,"A gang of criminals are ambushed and slaughtered by police. Their four multi-racial confederates wordlessly mingle their own blood in what appears to be an oath of revenge, and take to the streets, heavily armed, in a black muscle car. Police Lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) arrives for his first shift at work, on the last night before a precinct building is being shut down. Three criminals, including laconic and heavily chained Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), are being transferred between prisons, but have to stop at the precinct building when one falls ill. A civilian crosses paths with the carful of gangsters, and they pursue him back to the precinct building, gathering a small army of reinforcements and laying siege to all within.

John Carpenter's gift for economy might be seen to its best effect in this film. With one exception, the establishing threads are clearly and efficiently established, and once the action starts, there's not a wasted moment. (I didn't really get how the initial massacre by police was connected with subsequent events, and the above summary is basically an assumption. There's no suggestion that the police in the first scene are connected with the precinct that's closing, so I guess it's just that the baddies are riled up and unafraid of killing cops.) This efficiency extends to dispatching all non-essential characters within moments of the assault beginning, with fairly breathtaking ruthlessness: there's no sitting around trying to guess the order in which minor players will meet their ends. The villains' brutality is demonstrated in their repellent and reprehensible initial crime.

Character is likewise swiftly sketched. Bishop is determined and resourceful under his politeness. Wilson is wry, contained, and resigned to his fate serving a life sentence, but doesn't miss the opportunity to turn the tables on the casually abusive prison warden. Once the shooting starts, Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), a secretary at the precinct, displays a marvellously appealing, no-nonsense toughness.

Carpenter has spoken openly of aiming to make a (an?) homage to Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, and Assault has the feel of a film from earlier decades. The central characters follow a code of honour for which they are prepared to lay down their lives, and are ready to extend respect when it's earned, regardless of who people were before the crisis. Their mutual understanding means that words are used to make plans, not to philosophise, express self-pity (the weak don't live long enough for soliloquies), or volunteer some kind of unnecessary and grafted-on back story. As Wilson, Darwin Joston has the face of a character actor, and a couple of recurring catchphrases and bits of comic business (""Got a smoke?"") that work here, but wouldn't have been out of place in a film from thirty years earlier.

As well as Westerns, the other genre recalled is the zombie film, with faceless enemies in endless numbers, and a group of survivors trying to employ their ingenuity with limited resources. I don't think this entirely post-millennial reinterpretation on my behalf: Romero's original Night of the Living Dead was made in 1968, would certainly have been seen by genre/exploitation devotee Carpenter, and shares the relatively rare casting of a black man as a conventionally heroic lead. (After writing this, it turns out that other reviewers had spotted the connection/lineage straight away, and it has been a cornerstone of analysis of the film ever since.)

I have two version of it on DVD (mistakenly thought there were new special features on one) and was looking forward to the blu-ray upgrade.  Let me tell you friends, Shout/Scream has done this right.  The picture looks good, very good but the outside night scenes are a bit too lightened up in my opinion.  Not enough to ruin anything, just something you notice and go on.  I believe all the special features from the previous dvds are here.  Commentary by Carpenter (though I have not listened to it, so I am not certain it is the same one), convention appearance by Carpenter & Austin Stoker, the usual trailer and isolated score.  There is also an (looks new) interview with Austin Stoker and with the former Nancy Loomis.  (Hmm... that name seems familiar to Carpenter fans....) and it seems like there are more trailers but that maybe just me.
If you are on the fence about this, I suggesting getting it.  It's another early masterpiece by Carpenter and well worth your time.  I know a few people that were turned off by the ""low budget"" look of it, but for me that makes it even better. Darwin Josten as Napoleon Wilson is one of the great performances of the 70s.  He's an obvious prototype for Snake Plissken.  This is, in my opinion, light years ahead and better than the big budget remake from about a decade ago.

If you're an action movie fan then you NEED to have this terrific film in your collection. Minimalist in every way, but the film is so much better for it. Directed & edited (and written and scored) by Carpenter for maximum impact, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 grabs you by the throat from the brutal opening scene and never lets go until the final fade out. I think everyone who loves action films but has never seen this film owes it to themselves to watch it at least once. If you're a fan then this spiffy new Blu-ray edition is an easy-to-justify purchase. If you already own it in another format and have a Blu-ray player I whole-heartedly recommend double-dipping. Don't hesitate. Buy this for yourself - NOW. 5 STARS!

THE STORY: Basically a modern day, urbanized re-working of the classic John Wayne western Rio Bravo, with overtones of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead thrown in.

THOUGHTS: Miles above the pathetic 2005 limpdick remake, this is one of the most high-tension action films ever made.  It's one of those films I just never get tired of watching. I've owned it on VHS, 2 DVD versions and now... finally(!) on Blu-ray. I revisit this like an old friend at least once a year or so. The stars of this film are nothing short of riveting. Austin Stoker & Darwin Joston are electrifying and make an incredible on-screen duo once it all hits the fan. Something you know makes a great film truly great is that you can't get enough of the characters. You want to know more about them. I could have watched Stoker & Joston's characters just sitting in a room talking for a couple of hours and not been bored. I wanted to know what word or phrase Ethan Bishop etched into the top of that desk at the police station as a child that got him into trouble. I wanted to know the one other thing Napoleon Wilson said that a man should never do - even if it cost him his life. I wanted to know what happened to these characters after the events of this movie were over. Did Bishop stay on the force, eventually retiring? Did he testify before a judge on Napoleon Wilson's behalf, explaining how the inmate voluntarily joined forces with him during the gang's siege and risked his life to protect a total stranger AND a bunch of cops(!); perhaps getting the convict's sentence reduced from death to life in prison (or an even lesser charge)?? Even after seeing the film so many times over the years these questions and more run still through my mind. It's such a shame that neither of these lead two actors went on to greater things. Their taut performances in this movie seemed like guaranteed tickets to stardom but then perhaps that's just as well.

THE BLU-RAY: How great to have this now in 1080p hi-def. Some have taken exception to the tweaking done to the film, but I think it looks fantastic. Sharp focus, no artifacting or pixelation. Thankfully there is almost no crush (video noise), which is good since most of the film takes place at night or in low light. Sound is strong and level. Bonus features selection is decent. The Carpenter/Stoker interviews and director's commentary from the Special Edition DVD are ported over. New stuff includes a criminally brief but interesting new on screen interview with star Austin Stoker, and a newly recorded interview with Nancy Loomis. Also new for this Blu-ray edition is a second audio commentary featuring frequent Carpenter collaborator (and friend) Tommy Lee Wallace. All-in-all, pretty good stuff.

(While I'm thinking about it, I do have a minor complaint: John Carpenter's commentary really bothers me. As with several of his audio commentaries from his other older movies, Carpenter always seems to be apologizing for the end results of his films. Really John? Quit making excuses for things not being better than they were and be damn proud of what an amazing job you did with what little you had!!! For heaven's sake, the paltry budget for ASSAULT wouldn't even cover the catering budget on one of today's action films. Stop apologizing and take pride in what you did, instead of what you could have done! Several of your films are rightly considered classics and have earned that status as much for what they DON'T have as for what they DO. Your guerrilla film-making tactics have served as an inspiration to budding young film makers the world over - for DECADES, and they demonstrate what can be done with brains, heart and a little money instead of a bloated budget and too many fingers in the pot.)",1391904000,6,4610,4.67940813810111

741128,5,6303945317,"Assault on Precinct 13, in my opinion, is a very underrated John Carpenter film as well as an underrated film in general.  I feel that John Carpenter himself is a criminally underrated director and I know I am not alone in this.  The only film he directed that was a big hit was Halloween, which is the first John Carpenter film I saw as well.  Even The Thing was not a hit when it first came out.  I admit I did not know much about John Carpenter at first and only seen a couple of his movies.  However, a reviewer I am a fan of on YouTube called ramboraph4life is a fan of John Carpenter and reviewed all of his movies.  This prompted me to check out his other movies, and now John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors.  Some of his films I do not care for like Christine and Village of the Damned.  However, most of his films I really enjoy including this one.

The film stars a police officer named Bishop played by Austin Stoker.  He has not done much else besides after this which is a shame because he did a good job here.  He has been reassigned to this run down precinct that is about to be shut down called Precinct 13.  As the film progresses he is joined by a cast of colorful characters like Wells (Tony Burton), Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), Lawson (Marin West), and Napoleon Wilson played by Darwin Joston.  Darwin Joston, sadly, is another great actor that did not go on to do much after this.  Together these unlikely comrades must defend Precinct 13 which is under siege by this faceless gang of fanatics.

There is so much going for this film.  The story is simple, but sometimes simplicity is good.  The film has great atmosphere and mystery to it.  Normally having a group of faceless villains with no character is boring and a huge fault against the film, but here I actually think it helps the film.  These gang members go all out as well.  There is a scene where they actually kill a little kid in cold blood, which was quite shocking for the 70s.  The fact that these people are nameless and often faceless adds to the dread and makes the situation direr for our main characters.  The action is also great also.

The best aspect about the film is definitely the characters, particularly the two leads.  I really love Bishop and Napoleon and their relationship they have throughout the movie.  Even though one is a cop and one is a criminal, it is clear that they both respect each other.  Plus they both are given clever dialogue especially Napoleon.

The film does have a couple issues.  First off there is a character near the beginning named Starker (Charles Cyphers) who plays a big role in the beginning, but after a certain point the movie just completely forgets about him.  We are lead to believe that he died, but if that is the case it was a really stupid death.  Secondly, I thought that the girl, who played Leigh, Laurie Zimmer, is not that good of an actor.  For example, in the film, she gets shot and she barely has a reaction.

Overall, Assault on Precinct 13 is a great action/thriller movie.  I have not seen the remake so I cannot comment on that.  However, as far as this film goes it is very enjoyable and I wish more people would recognize it.",1380672000,7,3189,4.394871794871795

The gunmen unleash wave upon wave of attacks on the beleaguered station, but the cop proves himself a resourceful foe. This is a 1976 film written, directed, scored and edited by John Carpenter. The film initially met mixed reviews and modest box office gross. It is now considered one of the greatest and most underrated action films of the '70s.

741131,4,6303945317,"Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), directed by John Carpenter. 91 minutes

Plot:

A run-down Los Angeles police station is seized by a ruthless gang of murderous criminals on the eve of its decommissioning. A rookie officer is left in charge of a few stray employees and an assortment of prisoners who must band together to battle the intruders, lest they be mowed down in the path of their endless destruction.

Directing:

As Carpenter's second directorial effort, ""Assault"" stands as a prime example of the director's skill at turning something into nothing. Crafting such an intense movie with very little resources was a skill that would pay off big time a few years down the line with the release of his seminal slasher flick, ""Halloween."" There are other hints at future Carpenter-isms, such as his bleak world view which would be further exploited in ""Escape From New York"" and ""They Live."" In typical Carpenter fashion, very little time is wasted, and when one of cinema's biggest taboos in trampled underfoot within the first 30 minutes, you know you're in for a one-of-a-kind experience. But rather than resorting to pure shock value, Carpenter cuts through the ultra-violence with a dose of good humor and over-the-top action. The last block of film itself plays like George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" only with thugs rather than zombies cornering our beloved characters.

Cast:

Austin Stoker plays the wholesome hero officer, in sharp contrast to the self-assured and cool-as-a-cumcumber alpha-criminal, as played by Darwin Joston. While Stoker oozes the necessary likability, Joston hams it up a bit, making his character sound better on paper. No matter, though, as the two play off of each other beautifully and you find yourself rooting for each individual equally. Future Carpenter regulars Nancy Loomis and Charlie Cyphers have bit parts, but are inconsequential to the plot. As far as the villains of the piece go, they are a dime-a-dozen, and by the end of the film, there are literally dozens of them coming from out of nowhere. There isn't really a single villain you could pick out of the crowd, as they are mostly faceless.

Music:

A classic Carpenter scores pulses through the film at key moments, but is never over-bearing in the slightest. Within one viewing, you'll find yourself tapping and humming along, a sure-fire clue that you are watching a prime Carpenter film.

The Bottom Line(s):

""Assault On Precinct 13"" is a rather under-appreciated classic, though a minor one at that. It features a streak of ultraviolence and cynicism that could only have been produced in a post-Vietnam culture. Any fan of Carpenter, or thrillers in general should see this ground-breaking little film at least once.

Lessons Learned:

1. Never ask a black man if he likes his coffee black, unless you are prepared for a witty comeback.

2. If an ice-cream man gets your order wrong, it's probably best to cut your losses and not go back.",1378339200,,2960,4.991869918699187
741219,5,6303945317,"Shout Factory--the Criterion of 80s Cult Horror and sci fi-- is on such a roll, delivering a slew of great 70s-80s cult craziness I've begun just buying everything they put out, even when I already have it on DVD from years ago, like ASSAULT. I love this film! Just saw it awhile ago and my girl and I were humming the badass title tune for days. This film is so tight! It unfolds in real time, like a cross between Rio Bravo, The Warriors, and Carpenter's future masterpieces. as the years go by it's becoming more and more my second or third favorite Carpenter, JC's stretch from ASSAULT through HALLOWEEN, FOG, and ESCAPE FROM NY and THE THING is the greatest streak in all horror history, the equivalent of Hitchcock's PSYCHO-BIRDS-VERTIGO-REAR WINDOW run.

All of which goes by saying that even though this film was made for peanuts and has a low budget grime, it's still an essential on blu-ray, and you can trust SHOUT to do it right. ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, accept no substitutes and ignore the remake.

Next, dear Shout Factory, how about GET CRAZY (1983), that awesome Alan Arkush concert comedy, the dark cousin to Rock and Roll Highshool, with Lou Reed as Bob Dylan? It hasn't been released since it's first VHS debut back in 1983, you know, when VHS tapes cost $100 and were meant solely for rentals?

And.... what about getting Cronenberg's SHIVERS, and RABID out on blu? Right now there's just a  non-anamorphic DVD of RABID, and this film craves the smooth armpit hypodermic of rediscovery! and his SHIVERS isn't anywhere to be found...

741222,4,6303945317,"I remember watching this movie on TV at a relative's house in the 1990's. I was frightened out of my wits! Assault on Precinct 13(1976) was directed by a young John Carpenter. A bunch of angry gang members attack a worn out, dumpy police station! The police officers, secretaries and prisoners inside fight for survival! There's the infamous scene where a gang member murders a little girl near an ice cream truck! Assault on Precinct 13 was remade in 2005 starring Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne. In the remake, the bad guys are corrupt cops who want Ethan Bishop dead. The remake leaves out the ice cream truck scene and takes place during a snowstorm. The remake portrays Bishop as a gangster and Hawke as a police officer. Assault on Precinct 13 was a big flop in the USA in 1976. People in the US thought it was a dirty, ugly, grindhouse, exploitation film. In the UK, the film was a big box office hit! Carpenter also composed music for the film. I like the sad, sombre music that plays when a secretary gets shot to death by gang members. Carpenter kept the budget under control by putting a Western in 1970's Los Angeles, California. Movie buffs claim the film is an homage to Rio Bravo. The pacing in the movie feels like a traditional Hollywood movie. John Carpenter's Halloween(1978) came out two years later. The gang members in Assault on Precinct 13 are not portrayed as human. They have more in common with the zombies in Night of the Living Dead(1968). The police officers in the film work together, but there is racial tension between some characters. There is an Alfred Hitchcock reference in the film as Ethan Bishop tells a woman about his dad punishing him. Assault on Precinct 13 is a well-made 1970's B-movie.",1367884800,,1736,4.657980456026059

precinct fighting off street gangs. The lack of money shows and depreciates the scenes of violence, defence and offense. Yet the menace remains and lifts this little picture above what would it would have been otherwise.

Besides the director's genius for creating tension, moody music, meaningful dialogue, and so forth, not just one but two people steal the show here and when sharing scenes together...nothing else matters period. I'm talking about the cool death row antihero and the lethal secretary. One of the best stories ever for an action film, a gang goes kamikaze against the near empty precinct for previously gunning down some members. Carpenter doesn't let up and there is always something happening especially when you see how characters handle being thrust into a life and death situation. My favorite scene is during the first attack when all the men are busy shooting bad guys the secretary is sent in to release 2 convicts from holding cells and even though shot, she takes out a gang member hand to hand. In my book this is the coolest woman ever in movies. The rest of the film she is nearly silent because she is too busy walking the walk, while remaining feminine. You want to know about her but she is a total mystery and this is why the movie is so brilliant and works. Lots of bloody action, high drama, and two people making one significant presence that won't be forgotten in the history of movies. 16x9 picture is great.",1360108800,,1269,4.695067264573991

741273,4,6303945317,"There may not be a strong logical basis behind what happens in John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), but once set in motion, it proceeds strongly and solidly down a path filled with violence and destruction, as due to some strange circumstances, a police station scheduled to be closed down, becomes the site of a violent assault by a gang of ruthless criminals.

LAPD officer Lt. Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) arrives at Precinct 13 to take charge during its last hours of operation, and finds it manned by a pair of officers, and a couple of secretaries.  Later a bus with police transporting three prisoners pulls into the station, seeking to temporarily house the prisoners in the facility.  Among them is death row inmate Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston).

The trigger for the violence occurs when a man arrives at the station seeking refuge from a gang of criminals, having just killed a member of a gang, for gunning down his young daughter.  Very shortly, those inside the station discover that they are cut off from communications, and are soon under fire.

Next comes a direct assault, with gang members attempting to enter through the windows, and sneaking in the back way.  With few options, Bishop is forced to turn loose the criminals, and issue them weapons, in what will be a violent and bloody night, that few will survive.

Violence is something that Carpenter does well, and the senseless and brutal murder of a young girl, is just one of many shocking acts, in what soon becomes a parade of violence.  Comparisons of the gang members to zombies, are kind of appropriate, as they don't behave logically, attack without regard to personal safety, and do not speak.  Another theme is the camaraderie that develops between the prisoners and Bishop, and how these very different individuals, come to work together.

Little that happens stands up to any kind of serious scrutiny, but once set in motion, the film is quite engrossing as a tale of pure survival.  The characters aren't entirely convincing, but you still identify with them, as there are some strong performances by, Stoker, Joston, Laurie Zimmer, and Tony Burton.

741276,4,6303945317,"Assault on Precinct 13 was filmed with a low budget: that means ordinary sets, ordinary sound effects, and synthesized music. But it's a very good film. The plot is simple, and yet the tension gradually rises as the action kicks in right in the middle of the film. Action is simple, yet effective. The three main leads (Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, and Laurie Zimmer) are the strongest elements in the movie: they are purely believable. Carpenter's music is also enjoyable. The entire movie looks good, mostly due to Knapp's cinematography. I have a few complaints about the movie, though. There are a few supporting characters that I couldn't care less about. And what's worse, they give pretty dull performances for most of the time. There are a few moments of cheesiness, though they're not exactly distracting.

Still, Assault on Precinct 13 is a good movie. It's not excellent, but there are still some wonderful qualities attached to it. I'd say that it's one of John Carpenter's better movies.

741322,2,6303945317,"This is one title that keeps getting reissued and while it's a worthy film, this resulted in my getting confused enough to get the wrong one. There was a 2003 Image release and a 2005 Image release. The first one says Widescreen Edition on the front of the box and the 2005 one doesn't - but the latter does say so on the back of the box. The Amazon page for the 2005 release erroneously states that it's in the 1.33:1 ratio. There was a 1999 release that wasn't in widescreen.

The 2005 release, while selling for the same price, does not have any special features and the Carpenter commentary would be worth hearing. Why reissue the film just two years later and sack the extras? That goes against the usual policy of using extras to justify another gorging of the customer's pockets. Thus the two-star rating is to be applied to the 2005 release only - it looks and sounds fine, it's just that one gets less for the same money at the present Amazon price rate.

Still, I'm not about to spring for paying the postage back to Amazon when a few bucks more than the cost of postage will get me either the 2003 edition with the bonus features or for an extra buck-and-a-half on top of that, I can get the 2009 Image release of the ""Restored Collectors Edition"" which has the same extras apparently as the 2003 release.

But there's some question as to whether they've boosted the contrast and brightness too much for the 2009 outing. It's supposed to be a dark film, it wasn't meant to be bright and colorful like a Betty Grable musical.

I thought the gunfire effects would have more bass, but they didn`t. Ok, they had more bass than Rambo: First Blood and Tango & Cash, but i still think they could had more. Dirty Harry had much better bass than this film. I also think it had a more enjoyable active surround mix.

Dirty Harry is from 71 and this is from 76. Strange. It was probably people doing this remix fault. The Rear speakers was mostly used for music and somtimes in the action scenes.

741327,4,6303945317,"Assault on Precinct 13 Blu-ray Review

Distributor : Image Entertainment (US)

The original John Carpenter classic find it's way to Blu-ray disc courtesy of US distributor Image Entertainment who have unfortunately put this out on a region A locked disc.

The film has always been a must own title for classic movie collectors, so this review aims to see if the same would also apply to this Blu-ray release.

Assault on Precinct 13 has previously been widely available on a number of poor quality DVD releases which have mostly had varying degrees of problems including poor transfer, print damage and even wrong aspect ratio among them. This Blu-ray release presents a new1080p correctly framed 2.35:1 transfer which is a revelation to fans of the film. The detail which is present in the print is actually quite stunning considering the films low budget roots, colours are especially well defined and even black levels look impressive here. This film never has and probably never will again, look this good. There really is no comparison between this new Blu-ray transfer and some of those earlier DVD releases, finally this is how the film needs to be seen.

The DTS HD 5.1 audio is clear, although can seem a little flat during some of the quieter scenes, however it is at all times, free from distortion and I'm sure that any very slight muffling effect, is actually due more to the low budget roots of the film itself, rather than the presentation here. One really noticeable point on the audio, is the now classic score which sounds fantastic clearly pounding through your speakers like never before.

As far as extra features are concerned, firstly, there is an interview with director John Carpenter and actor Austin Stoker which takes place in some form of convention recorded in 2002. Following this, there is the original theatrical trailer, radio spots, still gallery, isolated score soundtrack and full director's commentary, which although perhaps not as fast paced as his usual commentary tracks, actually covers a wealth of information regarding the making of the movie, actors, filming locations and so on and it is highly recommended.

All things considered, this Blu-ray release has to be a must have package for fans of the film, or even for collectors of classic 70's action thrillers. It is unlikely that the movie will ever be bettered in it's presentation and to see the film in this new fabulous looking transfer, alone makes the Blu-ray purchase worth while.

For some unknown reason, Image Entertainments Blu-ray release seems to be a little harder to find than most regular Blu-ray titles. Whether through lack of advertising or lack of retailer promotions, this one seemed to slip through the net and it is surprising just how many people do not yet realise that the movie has even been made available on Blu-ray disc. This may also be the reason that even in the second hand markets the disc appears to be keeping it's retail price, so it may be a while before you find this one in the bargain section. Do not let that put you off though, if you can play region A locked titles, then this release is worth every penny.

An all time classic with a worthy Blu-ray release, comes highly recommended.

I guess beauty really is in the eye of the beholder because I saw very little in this movie that I liked. It's predictable, cliche, and poorly acted. For me, the movie jumped the shark when 2 of the prisoners had to decide between themselves which one would be the one to flee for help. How did they decide? By doing the old ""One potato, two potato...""! Ridiculous! And as another reviewer mentioned, there is a scene in which the female lead gets shot in the arm and doesn't even flinch - no change in expression, no nothing!

Like a lot of George Romero's work, when I watch (and rate) this film, I am taking into consideration (and forgving) the fact that John Carpenter had about five dollars to make it.  It's low budget, the sets are obviously sets, and some of the acting is...well, not great.

However, keeping all that in mind...this movie rocks.

You have a young director just starting to flex his muscles.  Yes, Carpenter has made some stinkers (Ghosts Of Mars anyone?) and some with great concepts that didn't quite pan out (Escape From New York...killer idea, bland execution) but he's starting the roll that would carry him through his classic stretch of films (Halloween, The Fog, Elvis, Escape... and, of course, The Thing).  Like a lot of young writer/directors, he uses influences as a base for his story and characters and he leans on some of the best here: Howard Hawks (Rio Bravo, El Dorado) and George Romero (Night of the Living Dead).  He creates a tight knit group, runs them through the ringer and lets their characters come out through the action, for good or ill as the case may be.

What works:

Napoleon Wilson: As played by Darwin Joston.  Not a great actor, but incredibly likeable here.  He definitely has his ""moments.""
The action: staged and edited beautifully.
The ending: our last three survivors revealed as the smoke clears.  Amazing.
The music: yes, repetive.  It also kicks ass.  When that theme comes on...killer!

The closing lines:

Bishop:  It would be an honor to walk out with you.
Wilson:  I know it would

And, the set up (SPOILER ALERT!): a child is killed.  Shot in the chest.  In medium close up.  The cute liitle blond girl from Nanny and the Professor.  Dead meat.  Now, I'm not cheering this but the audacity of the scene, without which we don't have a movie, is even today, truly stunning.

This a solid, low-budget action flick.  The kind they don't make anymore.  (And forget the remake)  The kind of movie you'd see as the top of a drive-in double bill.  And you'd forget to make out with your girlfriend because, once it gets started, you're watching.  And rooting for these characters.

Carpenter's first theatrical release was an unusual sci-fi 5-reeler made when he was a college student and augmented with new footage for official release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DARK-STAR/dp/B00000F169/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DARK STAR</a>&nbsp;(1974) had no budget to speak of and an often leisurely pace, yet its cult status is secure.

It's interesting to see how far the young director had progressed in this, his second feature. Realistic sets and props plus some exterior shots lend credibility to the work. Carpenter's solo electronic keyboard soundtrack remains, but these occasional pensive fills enhance a mood of apprehension.

For someone whose cinematic sensibilities have been blunted by decades of bullets and splattering blood, there's a moment during the ice cream truck scene that still shocked me. Haven't felt such an enervating jolt in a very long time. Up until then, the jury was out on this picture; now I was totally locked into its far-fetched story of dozens of L.A. gang members laying seige to a nearly abandoned police station.

Among a no-name cast is one familiar face. Ex-boxer Tony Burton plays a convict who tries but fails to make a run for it. Burton appeared in all&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/six-ROCKY-films/dp/B000WC3A0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">six ROCKY films</a>, first as Apollo Creed's corner man and then Rocky Balboa's.

It's important to note that in this version, the good guys aren't also the bad guys and like the remake, some bad guys can be good guys. Perhaps redemption is a perennial, generational desire.

John Carpenter's ""Precinct 13"" may be old-fashioned by today's standards, yet give me more of this sort of actioner where suspense and danger are palpable and a viewer isn't overwhelmed by CGI and other special effects that buffet you like a handball against a roaring wall of noise soundtrack.

The plot is completely implausible: I laughed at it. In the middle of S. Central LA, a police station is being ""closed"" and no one seems to notice when a huge gang assaults it with rifles and guns blazing, for hours. You can hear crickets chirping in the station itself, which seems to be located in some type of park-like area. The interior looks like it was quickly remade from the set of a Western saloon, not a 1976 modern police station. I did enjoy seeing the vintage 70s cars: the cops all drive Ramblers! The girl who plays the station clerk wears a zombie-like expression throughout, even after she takes a bullet in the arm. Naturally, she falls a little for the death row inmate who kind of saves her. We never miss a chance, either, to shoot her in her tight sweater. If you need a laugh at an old-fashioned type of 70s movie, give this a scan.",1269216000,,1027,4.3264248704663215

741461,4,6303945317,"Ostensibly a remake of John Carpenter's cult favourite, the new and improved Assault on Precinct 13 acknowledges its debt to Rio Bravo early on with a couple of lazy Dean Martin Christmas jingles.

Martin was a deputy drunk in Howard Hawks's 1959 western classic, which is where Carpenter borrowed the plot for his 1976 cop drama. Hatchet-faced tough guy John Wayne played a bossy sheriff in the original; in that film, Dino and Duke keep a passel of bad guys from breaking into jail and grabbing their prisoner.

Same story here, except this time out we're in a condemned Detroit precinct on New Year's Eve, and the prisoner is a drug lord played by the lethally cool Laurence Fishburne.

The film's real departure, and gamble, is that Ethan Hawke, dweeb aesthete from Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is now playing the Duke's and Dino's cop characters. Hawke's Sergeant Jake Roenick is both drug addict and precinct boss. That's a lot of character acting for a perpetual juvenile 25 pounds shy of either Cagney or Lacey.

Screenwriters Carpenter (he'll be redoing films at 100) and James DeMonaco wisely get us used to Ethan as a tear-away action adventurer in a ferocious pre-credit drug sting. Sgt. Jake throws himself around with nervous athleticism. Nevertheless, two fellow officers go down. And Jake catches one in the pin. Then, suddenly -- quick cut -- we resume action eight months later. Our limping hero is now a wisecracking junkie (Scotch and Seconal), trying to forget about A Time When He Cared.

Making matters worse, the force shrink (Maria Bello) shows up New Year's Eve, wanting to know why Jake is still hiding behind a desk in a soon-to-be abandoned precinct. Everybody else is long gone, except for a party-girl secretary (Drea De Matteo) and an aging cop, ""Old School"" O'Shea (Brian Dennehy).

Elsewhere, a mobster with a dangerous secret (Fishburne) is on his way to jail. Someone's trailing the van. Just as the expedition nears Jake's station, snow turns to ice and the cop car skids out of control. Driving is impossible. Detroit has been shut down. The van and its captives will have to hole up at Precinct 13 for the night.

One of this enlightened B-movie's many pleasures is French director Jean-Franois Richet's handling of atmosphere and setting. Shot almost entirely at night in a blinding snowstorm, the crime drama is an intriguing remodelling of a classic film noir. It's a black and white movie by function of climate and time of day, with vivid stabs of colour -- a spreading stain of blood in the snow, Bello's flashing gold hair and Jake's frightened blue-green eyes.

Richet also knows how to shoot action scenes. And his screenwriters scatter just enough bits of business and tough-guy patter around. Fishburne does a newspaper crossword puzzle for the first half of the film. And at one point a prisoner mocks a junkie inmate who, like Jake, is going through withdrawal by snarling that he's ""sweating more than Mike Tyson at a spelling bee.""

Another plus -- the supporting cast has been shrewdly chosen. Ja Rule and John Leguizamo score as petty criminals locked up with Fishburne. Gabriel Byrne, who decorated the crime classics Miller's Crossing and The Usual Suspects, is walking the beat. And it's good to see Drea de Matteo working her eyebrows and hips again after getting bada-binged on The Sopranos.

The film is not without fault. Hawke only holds his own as an action hero. And Maria Bello overplays a badly conceived character. Most of all, the film needs another player as potent as Fishburne.

Still, Assault on Precinct 13 is a smartly assembled noir package. Canadians in particular might find it perversely satisfying to watch somebody else curse and fight their way through a deadly winter storm. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216598400,,3793,4.92018779342723
741462,3,6303945317,"Warning : this review will have spoilers.

I saw this for the first time (and last - I can't watch the ice cream sceen again) last night. Ok movie, but I felt like I was watching a remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" more than a gang movie. The way the gang members silently walked about outside and just mindlessly rushed the building later despite getting shot so easily, they seemed more like zombies. Granted, zombies with silencer equipted weaponry, but members of the mindless undead just the same.

As for the confrontation between the father and the gang members who killed his daughter, I found that very unconvincing. I think it would have been much more believable had he not found the gun in the ice cream truck but instead just rammed the gang members' car off the road with his own and than beat them to death with a tire iron (would have been more emotionally satisfying as well). It would also explain why he did not get into his car and drive away (which is something I did not understand).",1213056000,2,1008,4.4728260869565215
741543,4,6303945317,"For me it isn't quite a four star film, but its nearer to that than 3 stars. Effectively its a remake of Rio Bravo, restaged in contemporary Los Angeles. For those not familiar with Rio Bravo, a Sheriff and some friends are holed up in his office fighting off an attacking gang.

There are reasons to criticise it. Some of the acting is really awful and nothing can ever hide that. However its directed by John Carpenter at a time when he only made good and sometimes all-time classic movies (Halloween followed this two years later). The pacing, camera-work and action are all first class. Carpenter also contributed the original music. This is one of his very best pieces of music, very sinister, and I'm sure that it contributes a lot to the overall atmosphere of the film.

My view is that its a flawed classic, that you'll either love or hate. The fact that they bothered to remake it three years ago indicates that it must have had some good qualities. Watch it and find out!",1206489600,,981,4.536723163841808
741544,3,6303945317,Just watched this for the first time since the late 70's. I must say the movie still holds up. It is a low budget flick but it is done really well and for what it is it is pretty damn good and entertaining still. And I must say it beats out the slick hollywood remake by a mile.,1205625600,,278,3.810344827586207
741545,4,6303945317,"""Driven by random violence, chance and fate"" as Carpenter put it on the commentary track, it's easy to see his breakthrough feature (in the UK at least: it tanked Stateside) as a reaction against the cynicism of both the times (""There are no heroes anymore, only men who follow orders,"" says a voice over Austin Stoker's police radio) and its style of film-making. Carpenter's films often take place in a wasteland or an abandoned environment - Escape From New York, The Thing, They Live - but that is more of a narrative device to highlight his characters' self-reliance and increase the odds against them than a springboard for social criticism.

Always at his best with a low budget that forced him to rely on his intuitive sense of the cinematic to overcome, Carpenter in his prime was a visceral director with a knack for updating classic genres with wit, imagination and style (not to be confused with the modern equivalent, which had more to do with slick cinematography and snappy editing). Here he gives all the trimmings of urban paranoia, particularly potent in a decade (the seventies) increasingly aware of growing alienation from and loss of community, with an old-fashioned tale of reluctant heroes doing what they've got to do complete with macho Hawksian dialogue and a classical film-making style.

Sure, it's Rio Bravo set in seventies LA (the working title was The Anderson Alamo) boasting possibly the first politically correct urban villains in the shape of its inter-racial gang who take on a half-shutdown police station, but that's no bad thing when half of Hollywood was imitating Serpico or The Exorcist (remember when William Friedkin was the most influential and emulated director in the business?).

Austin Stoker gives the film a sense of gravity with his soft-spoken authority as the cop on his first night out, Laurie Zimmer does a good Lauren Bacall that could have been even better if Carpenter had been able to shoot a few more set-ups and have a bit more latitude in the editing, but the undisputed star of the show is Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson. A Hawksian hero in the Mitchum mold, he doesn't have as much dialogue as the other players, but what he has is choice (""He fell over,"" says a prison warder after kicking him out of his stool. ""Yeah, I don't sit down as well as I used to.""). His personality dominates the movie so much that you wonder why, a brief cameo as 'Dr Phibes' in The Fog aside, he never went on to better things.

Pitched as a blaxploitation flick in the US to miserable box-office but a surprise smash hit in the UK (enough so to drum up the budget for Halloween), a few former aficionados of the film have expressed disillusionment with it after seeing the widescreen DVD, and it's possible to see why. Oddly enough, the Scope frame probably slows it down on the small screen since the panning and scanning cuts from one side to the other on TV broadcasts break up the long takes and create a different rhythm and pace. Still, in Image's 2.35:1 widescreen transfer the film probably looks better than it did on its first release - after a decade-and-a-half of dupey prints, it's quite a shock to see a sharp print. And there's a great selection of extras too: an occassionally illuminating audio commentary with a few of the dead patches common to Carpenter's commentaries, a Q&A session with Carpenter and Stoker, a heavily scratched theatrical trailer, 2 radio spotsand photo gallery. There's also an isolated score track for Carpenter's classic synth score, for the most part a marvel of musical economy (one theme is inspired by Jerry Goldsmith's Rio Lobo) with a really great main theme.

If you can remember that brief moment when Carpenter was the most interesting new director on the block - it was no coincidence that he shared magazine covers with Steven Spielberg back in 1978 - chances are you'll still find much to enjoy in this archetypal late-night movie. Maybe fond memory patches up some of the film's rough spots, but hey, isn't that what nostalgia's for?",1203206400,,4039,4.805755395683454
741546,4,6303945317,"First, let me suggest that if you are looking to purchase Assault on Precinct 13 that you go with the enhanced Special Edition&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-on-Precinct-13-Special-Edition/dp/B00008974J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault on Precinct 13 (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;instead of this one .

How many movies do you remember seeing back in a different lifetime that you thought were really cool only to check 'em out in the current day and find that they really were average at best? Don't worry...Assault on Precinct 13 is not one of those movies.

There's just something about movies made before the early 80s that just scream, ""this-movie-was-made-a-long-time-ago."" And Assault on Precinct 13 does too. 31 years is a long time, but after watching Assault on Precinct 13 again this past weekend for the first time since 1976, I was surprised to see how affective the movie still is.

This is one of the first R-rated movies that my dad took me to. So I chalked up the memorable impression that Assault on Precinct 13 made on me to...well...being an impressionable 15 year old kid that was just excited to being going to an R-rated film. Who knew that the reason was really that back in 1976 I was watching the movie that turned the corner for Director John Carpenter from B-movie director to one of the best Horror/Action/Sci-fi storytellers of all time?

The story is simple and the acting is pretty good. Some guy and his daughter have the unfortunate experience of crossing paths at the wrong time in the wrong place with a violent street gang. After a brutal exchange between family and gang, the guy retreats to Precinct 13 with the gang close behind, and the Assault ensues. (I'm not much into spoilers, so my vagueness is deliberate. I will say that the intense ice cream truck scene stayed in my mind for 31 years as if I'd seen it a day ago.)

The Special Edition (in the link above) is presented in a nice widescreen aspect, but the audio is only stereo (which you won't even notice unless you have a Surround system).

741547,4,6303945317,"How many movies do you remember seeing back in a different lifetime that you thought were really cool only to check 'em out in the current day and find that they really were average at best? Don't worry...Assault on Precinct 13 is not one of those movies.

There's just something about movies made before the early 80s that just scream, ""this-movie-was-made-a-long-time-ago."" And Assault on Precinct 13 does too. 31 years is a long time, but after watching Assault on Precinct 13 again this past weekend for the first time since 1976, I was surprised to see how affective the movie still is.

This is one of the first R-rated movies that my dad took me to. So I chalked up the memorable impression that Assault on Precinct 13 made on me to...well...being an impressionable 15 year old kid that was just excited to being going to an R-rated film. Who knew that the reason was really that back in 1976 I was watching the movie that turned the corner for Director John Carpenter from B-movie director to one of the best Horror/Action/Sci-fi storytellers of all time?

The story is simple and the acting is pretty good. Some guy and his daughter have the unfortunate experience of crossing paths at the wrong time in the wrong place with a violent street gang. After a brutal exchange between family and gang, the guy retreats to Precinct 13 with the gang close behind, and the Assault ensues. (I'm not much into spoilers, so my vagueness is deliberate. I will say that the intense ice cream truck scene stayed in my mind for 31 years as if I'd seen it a day ago.)

The movie is presented in a nice widescreen aspect, but the audio is only stereo (which you won't even notice unless you have a Surround system). The tinny stereo sound was a constant reminder throughout that I was watching an ""old"" movie.

Also, the element of police ""overreaction"" to gang members at the beginning which led to an assault on a police precinct. It's surprising you don't hear about precinct assaults in the news. You get enough disenchanted people together, much damage can be done. Their mentality is a lot like terrorists today with the ""martyr"" attitude towards their cause. This flick and Stallone's ""Nighthawks"" unfortunately depicted what the world has become today with enough disenchanted people in this world to make each and everyone of us vulnerable whether we are in a department store or on a lonely nature trail. I refuse to see the remake that was released. This movie is classic and everyone should see once with an open mind.

It would be a tremendous understatement to say I was disappointed.  This film is horrible in nearly every respect, but this is the film's fatal flaw: A ""character study"" is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature.

The film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice.  Sorry to bring up the obvious here, but the ONLY thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping.  He would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station (he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun); he would not be worried about ""his chances out there"" (remember he's on death row); he would be concerned only with escaping IMMEDIATELY.

Sorry to all you fans of this ""cult classic"", but a movie in this vein must be at least SOMEWHAT realistic to gain my praise.  This one is a mess.",1147305600,8,1091,4.564102564102564
741552,3,6303945317,"""Assault on Precint 13,"" John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic, is the third John Carpenter movie I've seen.  Like every film fan, I admire ""Halloween"" as one of the most terrifying movies ever made, and ""The Fog"" brings some genuine chills despite some of its more cheesy elements.  Both films raised my expectations for ""Assault,"" as did the number of laudatory reviews I'd seen for Carpenter's movie, only the second in his career.

""Assault"" is Carpenter's much ballyhooed attempt to update the ""Western"" genre of film, and specifically ""Rio Bravo,"" by bringing the genre cliches from the plains of the Southwest to the gritty streets of L.A.  In many respects, ""Assault"" is a triumph, but in other key areas, ""Assault"" falls flat on its face.

From the opening credits, you can tell this is a John Carpenter movie.  First of all, Carpenter uses his trademark economy of notes on a synthesizer to create a haunting soundtrack, pulsing with dark power and ominous portent.  In a creepy opening scene, six members of the ""ultraviolent, racially mixed youth gang, 'Street Thunder'"" get gunned down by shotgun-toting cops.  In a typical Carpenter twist, we don't see the cops' faces during the shootout, only their guns . . . are the gang members the anonymous killers to be feared, or is it the anonymous, faceless cops?

Soon, other members of the gang swear vengeance against the city and the cops by slitting their arms and pouring blood into a bowl.  A reckoning is on the horizon.

Carpenter builds suspense with all his trademark skill.  Gang members cruise the city streets armed to the teeth with guns and silencers until an infamous confrontation with a father and daughter at an ice cream truck in a scene ominously titled, ""The Wrong Flavor.""  (This scene is as terrifying in its brutality as any scene from Carpenter's horror films, and still gives me goosebumps.)

The father ends up running to Precint 13, which is slated for closure and is only populated by a skeleton crew of two cops and two administrative assistants.  Street Thunder is naturally on the father's tail, and they aren't taking any prisoners.  Compunding the horrors of the evening for the small staff of the precinct, a prisoner-transfer bus has had to make an emergency stop because one of the inmates is sick, which leads to convicted murderer and Death Row inmate Napoleon Wilson being locked up downstairs.  Wilson's crimes are never discussed in detail, but it's clear from the wide berth everyone gives Wilson that he's a baddie of titanic proportions.

As darkness falls, Street Thunder (a faceless, innumerable band of street thugs) lays siege to Precinct 13, alternating machine-gun bombardments (stylishly achieved with silencers, so the bullets have a spooky ""pinging"" sound rather than a booming roar) with mindless frontal assaults.  Those inside the Precinct who survive the first wave of bullets join forces, cops and prisoners, to fight off the gang.  Can they survive the assault with low ammunition, no phone lines, and a seemingly limitless supply of murderers on their doorstep?

Carpenter brings a lot of flair to this movie, particularly when you consider that the budget for the flick was reportedly around $100,000 . . . low even by 1976 standards for an action flick.  Carpenter uses a surprisingly large bag of director's tricks for a guy making his second movie to create some genuine tension in ""Assault,"" and the entire movie is marked by a darkness and a bleakness that is quite powerful.

All that is to the good.  Unfortunately, ""Assault"" is marked by one of the weaker scripts you're going to find this side of George Lucas, and the acting isn't much better.  (What does it say when the most convincing line readings are given by Larry Burton as the convict Wells, an actor who is most famous as Apollo Creed's trainer from the ""Rocky"" movies?  Nothing good, I assure you.)  Napoleon Wells is played by Darwin Joston, and while everyone acts like Wells is the ultimate hard case, Joston completely fails to inject any of the rakish charm into Wells that the script labors so mightily to achieve.  Austin Stoker plays the straight ""white hat"" lead as the top cop in the Precinct fairly well, but again he's handicapped by some incredibly wooden dialogue.  Laurie Zimmer tries to inject some sultry sexuality into her role as Laurie, a secretary at the Precinct, but on a couple of moments you can actually see her looking at the floor to find her marks so she knows where to stand.

The gang members of ""Street Thunder"" are a mixed bag, as well.  If you rate them against the gang members of ""The Warriors,"" to choose another period piece about the gangs, or against any recent flick about gangs, they come across as almost comically impersonal and robotic (with the powerful exception of the ice cream cone scene, of course).  But for 1976, ""Street Thunder"" was probably a pretty scary bunch.  And if you view ""Street Thunder"" as a representation of the mindless evil prevalent in the disintegrating American society of the 1970's, they are pretty spooky as they just keep on coming in wave after wave.  (But still, modern audiences may not be spooked by a gang where a couple of the members are clearly wearing pressed khakis.)

It's difficult writing a review of a ""cult classic"" where you haven't drunk the Kool-Aid like everyone else.  You just know that you're setting yourself up for the patented, ""he just didn't get it"" response.  But after seeing the heights Carpenter can hit with his other movies and reading so many ""five-star"" reviews for ""Assault,"" I had high expectations.  In many respects, these expectations were met, but you can't give a glowing review to a movie where the dialogue and the acting are just so darn bad.",1132272000,6,5752,4.867556468172484
741573,4,6303945317,"John Carpenter, in my opinion, is the most brilliant horror/suspense/action genious of all time and the best director in the world, period.  That being said, my reviews of his movies are a tad prejudiced but some of his movies are better than others. This is a keeper.  It's not as good as Escape from New York or The Thing or Halloween, etc. but it's worth watching over and over and buying.

I won't give a summary, other reviews have done that. Let me just say, the clostrophobic atmosphere is realistic, the violence is not over the top but tasteful, the characters are gritty and real, and it's a fun flick.

I love the Napoleon Wilson character, ""Anybody got a smoke?"" lol

Crooks turn into heroes and show their heroic sides, there's PLENTY of suspense, and like most Carpenter films, you don't see the bad guys, just shadows and figures running in the night. Carpenter, as always, does his OWN music, and is it perfect or what!!? I love the theme song, great suspense music, sad and emotional music interludes also.

This movie has some real shocking scenes though (the ice cream truck, yeesh, wow!) so I'd wait till the kids are at least twelve to watch it.

This movie has the classic western theme that other reviewers have noted, that's what's so great about it.

That scene alone will blow your socks off.  The movie's ""stars"" were unknowns at the time, and this lack of familiarity helps make them more convincing.

Back in the mid seventies, when cinema verite and political thrillers where the norm, John Carpenter came up with a fresh and back to basics flmmaking approach that was simply entertaining and truly original. ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is Carpenter at his finest, as the film introduces the audience to what would later become the trademarks of his style: Masterful Panavision compositions, tight suspense sequences and a thumping synth score that is simply minimilastic brilliance. With a simple plot that serves as a launching ground for character interactions and suspense set-pieces that showcase Carpenter's stylish direction, this is Carpenter at his most creative, back when he made interesting, original and always entertaining films before his downfall in the 90's, when self-indulgence led to such works as ""Village of the damned"" and ""Ghosts of Mars"". *The Image region 1 dvd features a nice widescreen print, but sadly only a mono soundtrack, which serves the film fine, but with a score of that quality, a 5.1 remix is truly called for.

741579,5,6303945317,"Before there was Halloween, there was Assault on Precinct 13, John Carpenter's second movie and arguably his first masterpiece.  Fans of his later work should be warned though, there's no traditional horror or supernatural elements here, just one of history's all-time great low-budget action movies.  By now the plot should be familiar to just about anyone reading this review: a lone cop and a couple of lifers have to defend a virtually abandoned police station against a street gang's onslaught.  However, it's what Carpenter does with this concept that makes Assault on Precinct 13 such an exciting and memorable watch.  It's a brilliantly executed pressure-cooker of a movie, thrusting a few decidedly disparate people into an unimaginably dire situation and letting us watch them as they try to figure out what to do about it.  Although Carpenter has made much of the influence of classic westerns on this movie (Rio Bravo in particular), there are also ample doses of the eerie minimalism and stark brutality that Carpenter brought to Halloween, along with the tense, claustrophobic atmosphere that characterized much of Night of the Living Dead.  Released in 1976 against the backdrop of escalating violence and decay in America's cities, the movie plays perfectly into fears of urban crime, as a small band of heroes are literally confronted with an onslaught from a small army of gang members.  At bottom, though, Assault on Precinct 13 is a story of courage and heroism under the worst of circumstances, and it accomplishes this difficult task without being the slightest bit preachy, which may be even more impressive.

The movie certainly begins in a harrowing enough fashion, as the opening sequence shows six members of a gang known as Street Thunder being cut down by police gunfire in a darkened alley, followed by their gang's (oddly multiracial) leadership swearing a highly unpleasant blood oath vowing revenge for the deaths of their colleagues.  From there the movie slows to a snail's pace for a while, establishing the important plot points and characters and steadily building suspense as the members of Street Thunder cruise the streets of the ghetto looking for a suitable target.  However, this relative quiet is shattered in a most dramatic fashion in the now-infamous incident in which a little girl meets her unfortunate end at the hands of a machine-like gang leader (played in extremely menacing fashion by Frank Doubleday) while her father chats on a pay phone a few yards away.  Carpenter admits in the DVD's commentary track that this scene would virtually guarantee an NC-17 rating today, and it's hard to disagree: it's almost unspeakably horrific, both in its unflinching violence and in the utter anguish that ensues when Dad sees the gang's handiwork.  Things don't get much better when the girl's father exacts some revenge of his own on the shooter, as he winds up getting more than he bargained for and kicking the plot into high gear in the process when the rest of the gang pursues him into a nearly abandoned police station.

This admittedly obvious plot device doesn't just get the action of the movie in motion, it establishes an important pattern: long periods of exposition punctuated by explosions of hard-hitting visceral action.  Made for about $100,000 (a tiny amount even 30 years ago), Assault on Precinct 13 is hardly a big-budget Hollywood extravaganza in the vein of Die Hard or Total Recall, but its cheap and simplistic feel actually winds up working in its favor.  With virtually no money for special effects or big-name stars, Assault on Precinct 13 succeeds due largely to its emphasis on mood, economical dialogue, and characterization.  Much like the aforementioned Night of the Living Dead, this movie examines the dynamics that unfold when a group of strangers are thrown together and forced to confront a mass of nameless, faceless enemies lurking right outside.  More so than in Night of the Living Dead, though, here we really get an idea of the characters as people, particularly the three principals: Austin Stoker's amiable (and classically Afroed) black cop Ethan Bishop; Lynn Zimmer's determined secretary Leigh; and of course Darwin Joston's iconic convict Napoleon Wilson.  From his icy stare to his sardonic wit to his considerable azz-kicking skills (check out that textbook arm break on the thug in the holding cell), Wilson is right up there with Eddie Murphy's Reggie Hammond from 48 Hrs. in the pantheon of film's most memorable antiheroes-turned-heroes.

Still, for all its character and plot development, Assault on Precinct 13 is at its best when it's in full-bore action mode.  The violence is actually somewhat sporadic and generally not particularly graphic, but when it gets going it really gets going.  The movie's most thrilling sequence undoubtedly occurs when the members of Street Thunder stage a full-scale assault on the police station and its inhabitants greet them with guns blazing.  Watching Bishop, Wilson, and even Leigh dispense justice in the form of hot lead is itself more than worth any rental fee you might pay.  It's actually somewhat reminiscent of the legendary climactic church standoff in John Woo's The Killer, which is of course a good thing 'cause that movie rules.

Fittingly, Image Entertainment has decked out this new special edition DVD with loads of extras, most notably a full-length commentary track from Carpenter and an interview with Carpenter and Stoker (though mostly Carpenter, which is too bad because Stoker's a funny guy) filmed a few years ago at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood.  The commentary and interview are full of insights from Carpenter, from descriptions of the film's technical aspects to the art of low-budget filmmaking to discussion of the film's influences and the aftermath of its release.

741582,5,6303945317,"John Carpenter's claim to fame rests largely on his contributions to the horror film genre. He's responsible for the hugely influential 1970s slasher flick ""Halloween,"" of course, but he's also made several other noteworthy horror movies. His remake of ""The Thing"" still impresses over twenty years later thanks to a great cast, incredible special effects, and scads of claustrophobic atmosphere. ""The Fog,"" starring Adrienne Barbeau, is Carpenter's attempt at a good old-fashioned ghost story. I could go on and on, mentioning the killer car film ""Christine,"" the satanic ""The Prince of Darkness,"" and the Lovecraftian horror of ""In the Mouth of Madness."" Fortunately, Carpenter occasionally made films in other genres, such as the science fiction classics ""Dark Star,"" ""Escape From New York,"" ""Starman,"" and the hilarious ""They Live"" starring none other than one time pro wrestler Roddy Piper. In his prime Carpenter had the Midas touch, especially when it came to a very low budget action film called ""Assault on Precinct 13."" A new version of the film will soon appear in the theaters, perhaps it already has, but it's already quite obvious it will never approach the intensity of the original. How could it? Carpenter pulls a few nasty tricks in this movie that no studio would ever touch today.

""Assault on Precinct 13"" stars Austin Stoker as Lieutenant Ethan Bishop, heading out for the first day of his new promotion. Headquarters assigns him to drive over to Precinct 13, a station house located in the worst part of town, in order to help the remaining personnel there shut the place down. Meanwhile, a prisoner transfer is taking place somewhere else in the state, a transfer involving Wells (Tony Burton) and a dangerous felon named Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) headed to death row. Yet another incident unfolds simultaneously with the other two, as a father and his young daughter Kathy (Kim Richards) drive into the slums on personal business. Sadly, these two are completely unaware that several gang members involved in a weapons' heist perished in a confrontation with the police hours before. The gang declares a revenge war on the police and the city for the killings, with the prime targets being anyone unlucky enough to run into these guys on the streets. Of course, no one knows anything about this yet until the gang commits a particularly heinous crime that finds Kathy's father stumbling into the nearly closed station house. Gang members show up to terrorize the occupants of the building and reclaim the father.

At roughly the same time Napoleon Wilson, Wells, and the rest of the prison transfer crew show up at Precinct 13 seeking a doctor for a sick inmate. Only Napoleon and Wells survive long enough to make it inside thanks to the gang members, who lay down a withering fire using the arms captured in the heist. The rest of the film from this point forward moves with lightening speed as Bishop, beautiful secretary Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), Wells, Wilson, and a few others must overcome the mutual distrust that exists between criminals and the police if they are to survive. One thing is for certain: the gang members laying siege to the station couldn't care less who is inside the building. They will kill anyone in an effort to get at Kathy's father. With no phones and no way to move around outside the building, Bishop and his cohorts must rely on a few weapons and even fewer rounds of ammunition to stay alive. Any attempt to escape from the station house spells disaster for those who try it, and it isn't too long before the survivors crouch in the basement awaiting the final bloody assault. Will the police discover the occupants of Precinct 13 before the gang members overwhelm them? Who will live and who will perish? What will happen to Napoleon Wilson after the heroics he displays fighting off the gang members? Watch and see.

There isn't much to dislike about Carpenter's action classic. Sure, the acting is a bit wooden, especially in Darwin Joston's portrayal of the laconic Napoleon Wilson. Too, I found the whole ""potato"" game a bit ridiculous. But aside from those niggling problems, ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is an assault on the viewers' senses. Lots of shoot 'em action helps propel the narrative in the station house, but the stuff going on in the outside world is just as interesting. If you've seen the film, you know what I'm referring to as ""outside stuff,"" namely the reason Kathy's father arrives at Precinct 13 in a state resembling a nervous breakdown. I won't spoil this shocking scene for you, but it's the sort of sequence that makes the difference between a film and a cult classic. Nothing we see up to that point prepares us for what happens, and it's the sort of thing that never loses its power to shock. I've seen this movie a dozen times and I STILL sit in utter amazement when that part of the film arrives. You can bet your bottom dollar the remake won't attempt to recreate this scene. I've recommended ""Assault on Precinct 13"" to friends based on this horrific scene alone.

The Special Edition disc comes loaded with extras. The commentary track with John Carpenter is fairly low key but essential to listen to for his explanation of the aforementioned shocking scene as well as learning about the nuts and bolts of low budget filmmaking. Also included is a videotaped interview with Carpenter and Stoker filmed at one of those horror/science fiction conventions, a trailer, a still gallery, and radio spots. I recommend skipping the latest incarnation of ""Assault"" and going with this one instead.",1105747200,3,5586,4.89545934530095
741677,4,6303945317,"In-between his debut with the ultra low budget 1974 cult classic DARK STAR and his breakthrough success in 1978 with HALLOWEEN, John Carpenter, a member of the 1960s film school generation that also gave us Lucas, Spielberg, and Scorsese, achieved a minor miracle by making a taut action/suspense thriller on a budget that wouldn't even cover the catering bill on most big budget Hollywood flicks today.  ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is that film, and it is solid proof of what a mere $100,000 could buy in 1976 with the right story and the right people.

In essence an urbanized variation on director Howard Hawks' 1959 western classic RIO BRAVO, ASSAULT stars Austin Stoker as a newly-promoted L.A.P.D. lieutenant whose first assignment is to oversee the closing down of an aging police precinct building in south Los Angeles on a hot summer night.  At first, Stoker thinks this is nothing more than a routine matter.  But after a young girl (Kim Richards) is killed alongside an ice cream truck by gang members, and her father (Martin West) seeks refuge after killing one of the thugs, Stoker and his skeleton crew, which includes prisoners being transferred from one jail to another, find their building under siege from dozens of multi-ethnic gang members who are willing to kill with extreme prejudice.  Stoker and the remaining staff of the precinct must align with the prisoners (including Tony Burton and Darwin Joston) to hold the building and eliminate the gang bangers.

The result, despite some melodramatic dialogue and cliches, is a very provocative crime thriller from an era in which most such films gave audiences credit for having brains.  Much has been made about the similarities between this film and RIO BRAVO, as well as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and they still hold up quite well even now.  But equally important, the film's story of people under violent siege also resembles the climaxes of both Hitchcock's THE BIRDS and Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS.  Through his own editing (as John T. Chance, the name of the John Wayne character in RIO BRAVO) and music score, Carpenter ups the ante in terms of suspense, and the scene of Richards being killed at the ice cream truck is violent and disturbing without being a gratuitous case of blood and gore.  Stoker, a veteran character actor in numerous 1970s action films, does a good turn as the head cop.

Filmed primarily on location in south Los Angeles, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is a textbook example of how tension, suspense, and highly-charged action can be made coherently on a shoestring.  It is a very fine cult film that time has been very kind to.",1104883200,5,2618,4.858426966292135

However, I soon found out that it was fairly bare boned, save for a commentary (which was actually recorded from the laserdisc edition) and the theatrical trailer.  In short, I was dissapointed.

I recently found this version in a store and bought it.  There is definitely more stuff in it, including info about the film and an interview with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker.  However, I do have one complaint.  The commentary is the same one from the other DVD.  I thought Carpenter had recorded a new commentary.  Guess not.  I indeed prefer this version to the other one I previously bought, but the lack of a new commentary cheeses me off.

As for the film itself, I highly recommend it.  Defininetly one of Carpenter's best.  I suggest you buy this movie, even if all you can find it on is VHS.  It's worth it.",1093996800,2,929,4.524096385542169

741681,5,6303945317,"John Carpenter, like Spielberg, is aware of the history of cinema, and often references earlier films (and other pop-culture material) in his work.
As many have pointed out, ""Assault"" is essentially a modern-setting remake of ""Rio Bravo"", and quite well done, with horror-type elements reminiscent of films like ""Night of the Living Dead"".
Carpenter seems enamoured of the ""unstoppable-mysterious-thing that wants to eat your face"" plot; all of his best films seem to use some variation on it.  In this case, the Nasty Thing is the uber-gang ""Street Thunder"", who have declared war on straight society in general, and on the cops in particular.
A point that not a lot of people seem to have noticed is that there is/are strong influences from Sergio Leone's brilliant Western, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (my unequivocal choice for The Greatest Western Ever Made (currently #2 on the IMDB user's list of 50 Greatest Westerns, second only to Leone's own ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly""):
Both films set up the major action with acts of on-screen violence that were virtually unthinkable at the time -- here, it's the casualness and the identity of the victim, in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", it was that plus the shock of recognition of the actor playing the killer.
When first i saw this film, i believed that Darwin Josten's character, Really Bad convict Napoleon Wilson, was played in emulation of Robert Mitchum -- more recently, i realised that the character is basically inspired by (and Josten is emulating) Charles Bronson's ""Harmonica"" in ""Once Upon a Time in the West""; both are mysterious, laconic and Very Dangerous men who will reveal their backgrounds and intentions ""...only at the point of diein'...""
In the Leone film, another character says of Harmonica that something is driving him, ""...somethin' to do with death...""; that applies, i think, equally well to both Leone and Carpenter -- their best works are films that overtly have ""something to do with death"" in their basic structure.
Now, i'm not saying that this film is the equal of the Leone -- very few if any are.  What i am saying is that this film definitely resonates -- both deliberately and, i am sure, because of Carpenter's own quirks and obsessions -- with the Leone.
TRIVIA ALERT:
Watch for Carpenter's cameo as a gang member who *almost* makes it in through a window,
and,
Science Fiction fans who have read the novel ""The Price of the Stars"" by Doyle and MacDonald may feel a bit of deja vu; an important chapter in that book, involving an assault on an isolated Space Force medical station, is admittedly based on this film.",1086998400,,2618,4.815555555555555
741682,5,6303945317,"A cracker of a film from the start. Carpenter builds the atmosphere in a way that seems unique to his own personal style. Using actors which are unknown and therefore not stigmatised by expectancy from past performances works, and serves to enhance viewer empathy with the characters.
The plot is simple enough, the Precinct in question is a Police Station which is being closed down, the people within it are a few staff and prisoners, awaiting final closure for transfer, and the assaultees are a gang of callous youths, down on the system, and up on the chance to show it.
It's the coldness and calculated methodology behind the building attack which makes the film so dark. What's more, it's believable, which only adds to the effect. The musical accompaniment too, parallels this, giving the impression of impending attack, and then respite, albeit a brief one. As films go, especially considering the budget, this is as good as you'll see in a long time.",1085616000,,960,4.859756097560975
741683,5,6303945317,"John Carpenter's reworking of the Rio Bravo concept is one of the best action films of the 70s.  It's an action film, but it has the feel of a horror film, most obviously Night Of The Living Dead.  Personally, I see this film as a sort of prequel to Escape From New York.  It almost feels like the last few years before the whole New York prison deal.  As in that film, the gang members attack in a silent, zombie-like swarm.  Basically, a group of people stuck in an almost abandoned police station band together, putting all differences aside, to fight back against a siege on the station.  Why this gang is attacking this prison is anyone's guess, but they hint early in the film that it's revenge for a gang massacre at the hands of the police.  Still, why are they going after these particular people in a station obviously abandoned?  And why blast an ice cream man to kingdom come(not to mention a little girl)?  Who really cares why they're doing it coz it's fun all the way!  Yeah, there's quite a bit of dated lines that make the film seem pretty corny;  But bear in mind, these macheezmo lines are used in this film before they were a common action movie cliche.  At one point our two criminal heroes decide who's gonna make an escape attempt by playing a game called ""Potatoes"".  It's a wacky combination of Rock, Paper, Scissors and PaddyCake that's hilarious to watch.  I only hope Carpenter intended that to be funny.  In the interview section of the dvd, someone asks John Carpenter how you win this game.  As many times as I watch it, I still can't figure out how he won(""I told you I'd lose!  Dammit, we're gonna do it again!"").  Watching Assault On Precinct 13 is a very satisfying experience and makes you long for the days of good tough guy action flicks.",1083369600,2,1776,4.462732919254658

With the police on red alert, a soon to be shut down station comes under siege and a single cop, some death row prisoners, and a secretary are forced to defend the building from seemingly countless gangsters.  The plot is paper thin, but fast paced, gun toting action and an intense score by Carpenter compensate well.  Casting was done well though I only found one character (Wilson) truely relatable.

The special features include a very comical interview with Carpenter and Stoker done very recently where some lucky fans got to ask the pair questions regarding this movie along with asking about other John Carpenter classics. Assault on Precinct 13 proves that John Carpenter can make a masterpiece out of a budget no matter how high or low that it is.

If you liked ""the fog"", ""Escape from New York"", ""The Thing"", then you already have a taste for how he puts people together and then squeezes then ever so slightly.  (I believe this might have been filmed before he met Kirt Russell as well).  The music (as in ""Halloween""), sets an erie tone as you follow several characters until their destiny greets them.  I mean, when a little girl gets it next to an ice cream truck, you know there are some mean dudes here (they knock off the ice cream guy too...but not until he shuts his ""come and get it"" music off).

741729,4,6303945317,"I saw this on late-night t.v. and is a film that packs quite a wallop. The film opens with some men who are brutally and violently gunned downed by the police. The following morning it is revealed that the men are part of a street gang that has stolen automatic weapons from the police and the remaining gang members make a pact to avenge thier comrades and declare war on everyone. In another part of L.A. police officer Bishop (Austin Stoker) has been assigned to see the closing of precinct 9, division 13 in South Central Los Angeles. The station is without prisoners. A couple of secretaries, Bishop and a desk sgt. are the only inhabitants and the power is going to go off in a matter of hours. A bus loaded with a couple crooks on thier way to prison stops by the station,  as one of them is sick  and are put into cells temporarily. The story then moves back to the gang members who stop an ice cream man and shoot him while a little girl is killed also. As the gang leaves, the girl's father finds her dead and the i.c. man tells him of a small gun in his dashboard as he too dies of his wounds. The father then follows the gang as they both pull over and engage in a shootout with the father killing one and running for his life as the other goons follow him. He then arrives at precinct 13 and the goons declare war on the precinct and it's up to both the civilians and crooks to work together to stay alive for the rest of the night. The film is an extrodinarily piece of filmmaking and made for minimal amount of money but, it looks like, it was made for a lot more.

thriller, and as such, it can't be faulted. Police Station Precinct 13 is
going to be closed down, leaving a new Lieutenant in charge on the last
day. The cells are empty. A skeleton crew is on duty. Things are winding down
pretty nicely as the slack has been taken up by the new police station. However,
events begin to gather apace. A man wanders in. He is traumatized. He cannot
speak. Suddenly a huge armed gang who are after the man besiege the station.
The phone and power lines go down. The precinct is isolated. They are on
their own. The tension builds up nicely and never relents.
For a film like this, you don't expect too much in-depth characterization,
and you don't get it; but the script and the actors flush out the characters
with enough personality to make you care about them. Carpenter should be
given credit for making the central character black. In
1976, this was not common. Carpenter also does a good job at hinting at the
suppressed racism in the police force. Nothing needs to be said as the body
language of the white police officers says it all. It's done with subtlety
and is spot on. However, this is not allowed to get in the way of the
action. The film's protagonists are in a tight spot. We watch as they hold
out against the besiegers to the bitter end. Along with

This movie preceded all of that.  The plot focuses on a small group of police officers and convicts fighting off a relentless street gang in an all but abandoned precinct.  There are two central heroes of this movie: Bishop, a Black Police Chief who is new to the job & looking for a little adventure at the beginning of the film (a superior officer asks him ""Do you want to be a hero your first time out?"" ""Yes, Sir,"" Bishop replies); and there is Napolean Wilson, a White man on his way to death row when the prison bus he is riding is forced to make a detour (check out this plot twist: another prisoner starts coughing & wheezing, nearly passing out, and guess what, rather than pulling a shiv on the cop who examines him, it turns out the guy is really sick!  How often does that happen in a movie?).  Napolean Wilson is a man with a lot of snappy comebacks.  He says everything that we wished we'd said in certain situations after we thought about it because we know it would be so cool.  More than one character says ""You're pretty fancy, Wilson."" The details of Wilson's crime is never revealed, but the fact that it was exceptionally savage is clear by the response of everyone else's response to him.  These characters could have been lifted from any John Ford movie, but the fact that the movie takes place mostly at night and has a more contemporary time frame gives the movie a sweaty-palmed urgency that the Westerns lack. Even though the movie was made in 1976, the scene where the street gang cruises around & considers who to kill in a random drive-by shooting feels all too contemporary.  Director John Carpenter limits the dialogue of the street gang in much the same way that the old Westerns would keep Indians at a distance -- so that the audience would never feel any empathy towards them.  This hardly seems necessary as it seems difficult to feel pity for street gangs, but the move only helps to make them seem more fierce & inhumane than they might have otherwise been perceived.

This movie  is great and any fan of Carpenter's should check it out. Looks great on dvd  and has one of his enjoyable commentaries. Very violent gang movie with  Hawksian characters. This is a cult classic and it's easy to see why.,969235200,,363,4.714285714285714

7857014,5,6303945317,"This film works because it's rough around the edges. This is Carpenter at his white-hot best. Everything today is over-produced; today, they throw money at the screen and put Oscar-caliber actors in superhero flicks. Not then. Escape from New York. Halloween. The Thing. Assault and Halloween alone made the British Film Institute's Top 360 Films of all time, and that was a tough list, where films vied against all of the international cinema going back to the silent days. Carpenter, while not John Ford (whose films made the list more than anyone) made it twice for fast-paced cheap thrill-rides. Get it. Way better on re-watching. Besides, this film, like Craven's raw Last House on the Left, which looks as good as Straw Dogs now that time has passed, would never be made in our culture again.",1516406400,,798,4.875
