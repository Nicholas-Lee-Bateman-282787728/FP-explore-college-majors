4661988,5,B005DU58Q8,"Gotta love this Kdrama.  The acting was superb!  Loved that Ha Ji Won had such a kick a** female lead.  Loved the action scenes with all the cool martial arts and line work.  Hyun Bin plays his role of a slightly bent and geeky chaebol with remarkable finesse.  The word play between the two is fun and keeps the tempo up while they get to know one another.

The supernatural stuff was a little out there, but it helped that there was a slightly tongue in cheek air to most of it.  While you think the drama is pretty fluffy, it digs into some pretty solid material, like class/income differences, life after death, and gender role modeling. You find yourself rooting for Hyun Bin as he grows as a person, as well as Ha Ji Won as she lets herself soften to her emotional response to the lead.

This story is really sweet and salty in a lot of ways.  Put it in your definitely to see pile...you won't regret it.",1327276800,14,910,4.2748538011695905

4661990,5,B005DU58Q8,"Talk about your korean version of Freaky Friday!  Loved Hyun Bin in this drama as he certainly portrayed a deeper character compared to all his other roles.  Likewise with Ha Ji Won, bringing to the screen her ""don't mess with me streak"" combined with a hidden side.

A twist as well when it comes to the few last episodes where loyalty is tested with family.  Highly recommend!  Enjoyed the arrangement of songs in this drama as well.",1324857600,,435,4.597402597402597
4661991,5,B005DU58Q8,"I watch a lot of Korean dramas, and, I find most of them very enjoyable, but this fantasy romance which mixes comedy and drama to perfection, is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The chemistry of all of the actors is remarkable, the scenery and sets are lovely, and I know that I hurried home from work each night, thrilled to know that I'd get to watch this beautiful show. I won't give away any of the plot, but I will say it made me laugh and cry, and I was very sorry to see it end. Highly recommended to anyone who loves kdrama or just good entertainment in general!",1322870400,2,577,4.115044247787611

It came in a nice box set, unlike one I had purchased before. If you want quality make sure it comes from a legit distributor. I watched Secret Garden online and found the subtitles to be a little different than the DVD itself. No problems, love the drama, and to me it's worth the money.",1318809600,5,405,4.139240506329114
4661995,5,B005DU58Q8,"This is now my new favorite Kdrama beating out Full House and 18 vs 29. What makes this series work is the chemistry between the two main actors. You can feel the sadness, happiness and everything inbetween. The dialogue is witty and refreshing. There also isn't a lot of slow parts to the story as it just keeps moving at a very nice pace. Like Full House and 18 vs 29 this is a definate must buy. I also absolutely love the soundtrack to this series.",1315353600,19,452,4.267441860465116

4661997,5,B005DU58Q8,Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won are the perfect combination. It's Freaky Friday twisted with your typical korean drama setup of the guy being rich and a proud girl who eventually falls in love with the leading male. Has action to it and makes you want to keep watching the next episode. Could've made it so much more longer but only because I didn't want it to end. Absolutely need this in my collection. Soundtrack is great too.,1313798400,8,420,4.397435897435898
4661998,5,B005DU58Q8,I loved It.  This drama was one of the best I have viewed in many years.  There is nothing negative I can say about this Drama.  I will recommend this drama to others.,1394755200,,167,4.0
4661999,5,B005DU58Q8,"I've never watched a Korean drama before, but when I saw it on Netflix with English subtitles, I decided to give it a try.  Apparently it's one of the best Korean dramas out there.

It's a 20 episode tv series, an hour per episode, about a very acerbic, rich, arrogant CEO who crosses paths with a hardworking, poor, stuntwoman.  He's got a high IQ, but his EQ is sorely lacking. She fascinates him, so he keeps on going back to her even when he looks down on her.

The heroine is someone that I can admire. She is an ethical, hardworking woman who was orphaned, but managed to build a meaningful life for herself and make many close friends. She is poor, but dignified and kind. She is not impressed by the hero's snotty attitude or his wealth. With her quick stuntwoman reflexes, she is swift to kick or throw down the hero when he oversteps his boundaries or mortally insults her poverty, lack of education or lack of family (as he is won't to do).

The hero is brilliant in his aristocrat sphere where he understands high society dynamics and high class women's psyche. He's got wealthy, rich, beautiful high society women throwing themselves at him hoping for marriage, but he's totally cool, composed and unimpressed. Then he meets the heroine and is inexplicably fascinated by her. He follows her around trying to figure out why he's so interested in her, even coming up with lame excuses to see her..  Thinking he is just some country bumpkin (because he is so clueless) who keeps on pestering her, she gives him several verbal and physical setdowns. He is utterly confused by his fascination by her (he even asks his cousin why he looks forward to getting beaten by her), and tries to overcome it by reciting verse, in the manner of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy fencing in London, thinking, ""I must overcome this (fascination with an unsuitable woman!)"".  Awesome.

He's utterly clueless to the reality of working class women. For example, when the heroine tries to hide a mild injury because she is humble, doesn't want to make a fuss, and wants to continue working, he is shocked and incredulous because none of the women he knows would do that. He's so quirky and crazy in what he says that he's very comedic.  There are several running gags in the story, and my favourite is his sparkly tracksuit (especially the jail scene).

He gets his comeuppance when he falls madly in love with her and learns humility.  It sure helps when she gives him well deserved set downs whenever he gets out of hand. There are some reviewers who are uncomfortable with the few scenes where he restrains her so he can ask her questions or hug her - but honestly, the heroine is so fit and skilled in martial arts that she can kick his butt six ways to sunday, so she's actually passively letting him get his way so she can figure out what he wants. I'm sure that if anybody else did that, she'd quickly dispose of them (as she later does with some opposing bodyguards).

The wonderful dialogue, sizzling chemistry, class conflict and storyline were great. It actually reminded me a lot of Pride and Prejudice, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle style.

I watched the entire first episode and I was hooked.  I finished the series in only a few days. The series is very funny, charming, and romantic.  There's a body switch in there, in the style of Freaky Friday, which adds to the laughs.

The supporting cast is stellar, too.  There's the comedic secretary, the ambitious villian, the charming playboy music star cousin with a heart of gold, the beautiful high society musical director, the warm hearted roommate, the evil potential mother in law, etc.

The music is great, and after watching the entire 20 hour series, I went to itunes and downloaded some of the signature sountrack songs (just look up ""secret garden television"" in music - it's a 2 disc CD).  I like the side stories in this series too.  The singer star cousin, Oska, is hilarious and charming, particular in his relationship with the heroine that drives the hero up the wall.

I'm not familiar with Korean culture, so there are some things that are odd, but charming in the story. For example, they wear slippers inside their homes, sit on the floor to eat at low tables, bow to each other frequently, have some very odd men's hairstyles, and apparently there are many class distinctions in how their forms of speech to each other. Also, I've since learned that Korea has ""chaebols"", family conglomerates that control entire industries and wield vast power and wealth. These rich families tend to have arranged marriages with each other, and the hero is a prime example of what the scion of a chaebol would be like. They seem a lot like rich aristocrats in 1800's Great Britain, which is why the class differences are so stark.

By the time the characters fall in love, I was in tears - the story was that great!  Although their chemistry and flirting was awesome, they managed to convey an incredible love for each other through their acting, sacrifices, and a few modest kisses. So most of the film is funny and entertaining, and only at the climax does it become more tears and drama before the final denouement.

(The VVIP party scene was my favourite, but I won't say anymore because I don't want to give out any major spoilers.)

Very cute, a highly recommended romantic comedy.  I'm now watching the entire series a second time...

***I've now watched two other Korean dramas, and it makes me admire this couple's chemistry, the hero's love, and the heroine's character even more.  The other two dramas had annoyingly immature girls who acted as greedy, vulgar caricatures of poor people, and heroes who were either immorally cruel or had no chemistry at all. Secret Garden had mature, adult, yet very cute leads with great chemistry***",1392163200,2,5797,4.679133858267717
4662000,5,B005DU58Q8,"I wasn't much for watching shows with subtitles but it was available for free streaming so I thought 'why not.' The first episode pulls you in with the bad boy rich kid meeting the poor stunt woman. They don't get along at first but soon the tension builds and as viewers you know they are meant for each other. You laugh and cry with them throughout the show. Just my kind of romantic book turned into a drama. Hands down Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won (the two main actors) are my favorites probably because this was the first drama I watched. The storyline was romantic, funny, and angsty. I'm not much for sci-fi but the body swapping portion of the show didn't last long and it was essential to the storyline of the two main characters understanding one another.

I'm in my 30's and don't speak Korean but the subtitles were easy to follow. After raving about this show (and other Kdramas) to my friends and family - more of them are hooked. I always suggested this drama as one to check out first. The nice thing is that Kdramas tend to only be 20 or less episodes so story lines do not fall flat like most American shows that continue until they are suddenly cancelled.

If you are looking for something different to watch - give this one a try. You won't regret it!",1390608000,,1265,4.3559322033898304

4662005,3,B005DU58Q8,"Pros:
Witty dialogue, and story moves quickly
Good acting
Good development of secondary characters
Great soundtrack

Cons:
Cliched as hell.  Arrogant rich man, poor but proud woman, cartoonishly evil mom...the usual K drama tropes.
Targeted for a young (teenage) audience.  The usual teenage interests like music idols, action movies, dancing, etc pound you over the head.  Adults may find it immature.  Ra Im is supposed to be 30 years old and yet she has a huge poster of Oska over her bed and wears Oska socks?  Yeah, okay.  The characters often don't act like the adults they're supposed to be.  The body swap also involved a lot of juvenile humor.",1367020800,2,652,4.863636363636363

4662020,5,B005DU58Q8,"This is the first Korean Television show I've ever seen and I started watching it on a whim and I'm very glad I did start watching it. It's a love story, it's a fantasy, it's whimsical, it's heartbreaking and above all it's entertaining from the first to the last episode. The actors are really very talented and even though I don't understand Korean their acting transcended the language barrier.  I am good with subtitled movies and shows and this one was done very very smoothly.  Yoon Sang Hyun as Oska (Oscar) was engaging. Hyun Bin easily moved from a cold and aloof executive to a man falling in love with the character played by the lovely Ha Ji-won. Everything was gorgeous, the actors, the scenery, the story and the music. I was so impressed that I bought this from Amazon and have watched it since. It's hard to explain but the show makes me happy watching it and if you like a happy ending then you'll find this worthy. You can see it on Netflix, bits of it on YouTube but really, it'll only get harder to get a copy as time goes on so you'll want to grab it soon. The disk with the interviews with the actors is also subtitled so you know the folks who made this show care about everyone who would want to watch it and I for one appreciate that and will be looking for these actors and these producers again. Just lovely.",1364774400,4,1335,4.357429718875502

4662022,3,B005DU58Q8,"Hyun Bin is one of my favorite actors, I loved him in ""My Lovely Sam Soon"" He's well rounded, talented, and tend to choose his roles very carefully. Not to mentioned he's good-looking and has a dimple smile that can slay you. Having said that, I'm still trying to finish this one. I have about 5 episodes to go. My problem was not with Hyun, it was his leading lady. I'm having a problem with her ROLE.  Writers pay attention, how can she go almost the whole drama playing hard to get? When does it end?  When will they ever grow as a couple to put more meat in their roles? It's just repetitive at this point and hard for me to get through it. On top of that, it's not very believable. Hyun Bin plays a young, handsome, wealthy man whose the CEO of a chain of shopping malls. His mother wants him to settle down and get marries, so she's constantly setting him up on blind dates. He rejects each and every one of these beautiful women (always the case) and instead falls for a  poor, plain woman, who works as a stunt double, whom he just happens meet when he mistakes her for the leading actress. Sounds like Cinderella, right. WRONG. She rejects him time and time again. As I said earlier, I am long pass ten episodes and he's still chasing her down. In my opinion, it has gone on too long, not matter how it turns out, this drama is just OK.",1363564800,,1345,4.22568093385214
4662023,4,B005DU58Q8,"It was fun to watch the romance build between the marshal arts tomboy and the fussy conceited rich CEO, who couldn't figure out why he liked her. The storyline was good and I liked it. I think this is the first story I've watched, that focused on the stunt personnel. What a neat idea! So refreshing to see something new. I liked the spunky independent kick butt personality of the female character, and that the male character got to see her in her Tomb Raider duds and got to see her cool marshal arts defense tactics. I would have liked to have recommended the video, but toward the middle of the story, the writers added a homosexual character and seemed to promote that lifestyle, by saying there was nothing wrong with it. There was also some spiritualism involved, which was another reason why I couldn't tell people about the drama.",1361923200,,840,4.6066666666666665

Even though it has fairytale-elements, they are acted out so brilliantly, that it's easy to forget it's not exactly realistic. The characters are extremely different from each other, but somehow they match perfectly! I was hooked from episode 1. My favorite drama so far.

4662081,5,B005DU58Q8,"So I have a friend who really like KDrama.  She kept trying to get my girlfriend to watch them and I was basically untouched by it.  We noticed on Netflix that the KDramas were there and that made it easier to get in and watch one.  So I was working from home and decided to put one on.  This was the one I picked because it sounded interesting.  Boy was it ever.  I have now watched numerous other Kdramas as well.  I bought Secret Garden because to me it is still just one of the best I have seen.

The leads have excellent chemistry and if you are not touched by Ha Ji Won you have no heart.  This also has excellent background characters and no one is really weak.  The truth is that if they took the drama of the supporting characters it could have made a drama as well and probably extremely watchable.  Having watched quite a few that can tend to be a weakness in the whole genre in that other than the mains they do not do enough to flesh out the side characters.  Here they spend the time to flesh out 6-8 characters fairly well.

For US audiences, this is a romantic comedy.  We have kind of lost the art of making fun romantic comedies here because we either go way to sweet and sickly or we make it way too real.  That middle sarcastic battling has been lost to a large extent and its a shame that it has.  I adore a good romantic comedy.  I love the Thin Man and many of its follow ups (although they were not all good) because they showed a complex but fun relationship between adults without going to sweet or talking down to anyone.  This KDrama and several others that I have enjoyed (My Lovely Samsoon,1st Shop of Coffee Prince) are really striking that perfect chord.

4662083,4,B005DU58Q8,"Secret Garden starts out as a conventional Korean drama with a joke-y premise (the body switching) and the usual class / generation conflict. It did not impress me much for the first half of the episodes, but the actors were so clever with the body language and screw ups from the switching, so it was lightly entertaining. I was not prepared for the romance between the rich dept store heir and the poor stunt girl to actually become believable, and for Oska the pop star to suddenly become sympathetic, almost stealing the show. In the end, this show will sneak up on you and tear your heart out.",1346198400,4,598,4.546296296296297
4662084,5,B005DU58Q8,"I'm not fond of the body-switching theme, and it can get pretty weird here, but it's only in about 5 episodes out of 20, and the rest is so great that I couldn't resist buying this. Hyun Bin has wonderful facial expressions and that alone makes this series worth purchasing. The music is fantastic and the chemistry between the two leads is really good. The staring contests they have are what makes this so romantic, I think, and there are some really tear-jerking moments. Wonderful drama with a happy ending - buy it!",1338854400,2,520,4.602150537634409

4662086,3,B005DU58Q8,"I didn't have any expectations for this film.  It was entertaining but I found it dragging in many spots.  I kept thinking, ""can I fast forward this?""  Some parts were very funny and I enjoyed those very much.  The general idea is definately ""out there"" but it made for an interesting premise.  The actors do a great job switching roles.  Their body language when they switch is a testiment to their acting ability.  However, I didn't find myself drawn into the story as much as I am with other Korean films.  Overall, it was good but not one of my favorites.  I probably won't be rewatching this one any time soon.

Family viewing?  I would say, I little bit more mature then a PG just because of some of the verbal content, body exposure and sexual innuendos.",1336694400,,761,4.481751824817518
4662087,5,B005DU58Q8,"When a firefighter went in to save a fire victim, he gave up the prayer, Lord if my call comes, let me save one life and please look after my family. This was the prayer  that wove the carpet of fate that brought together the two lead characters in Secret Garden. This drama had depth, class conflict, love triangles,sacrifices,  and above all comical perfomances from our two lead characters. Add to this the swapping of souls like in freaky friday and we have an interesting and funny drama. The drama is very good on a lot of levels,and not surprisingly one of the top korean dramas of 2010. The storyline is very fresh and original and one that would have you on the edge of your seat with laughter mixed with all other emotions(sadness, joy, empathy, anger, etc) at the same time. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series, there was so much to learn, espcially about fate and destiny, love and perseverance, forgiveness and friendship. I think this is a must see drama for all who like Korean drama.",1336262400,,1019,4.593406593406593

4662089,5,B005DU58Q8,"For 2 days now after finishing the drama I've been confused in this empty, agitated, and longing feeling only to realize I have Secret Garden Sickness. Ha Ji Won and Hyun Bin secured this show as my No. 1 korean drama beating out all past ones and making me not want to even watch any other tv show at the moment because I'm stuck on this love story.",1334707200,,350,4.161764705882353
4662090,5,B005DU58Q8,"A mesmerizing romantic comedy of a poor stuntwoman who is mistaken to be a movie actress by a corporate CEO.  Once they discover the mistake, they part.  But the CEO cannot get her out of his mind.  Several love triangles develop (real and imagined) with them which include a fading pop star (the CEO's cousin), two directors and others.  The story revolves mostly around the stuntwoman and the CEO and highlights the differences between the cultures of the poor and the privileged.  There is a bit a magic in the story when they sometimes switch bodies.  And there are many subplots during the 20 hour story.

Everything about this is near perfect including the story, acting (especially the 4 leads), casting, directing, and pace.  A story is only engaging if you actually like the characters in it and I did, with the only exception of the mother who was meant to be an antagonist.  I found the story to be addicting and watched all 20 episodes twice in a 1 month period.  I only wish it was dubbed in English rather than having to read the subtitles.",1334707200,,1054,4.588235294117647
4662091,5,B005DU58Q8,"The video series is most enjoyable but it's the sound track that was absolutely done well.  I bought the CD that included all of the original sound tracks.  This is a well put together series.  The characters were perfect for the parts in the series.  I still like City Hunter, the series, but I like the music sound tracks in Secret Garden.  Can't go wrong with either series....so see them both.",1334102400,,397,4.535211267605634
4662092,2,B005DU58Q8,"the shows reputation made me want to see this - well - the beauteous Ha Ji Won would have made me want to anyway - but i did have higher expectations then usual - so the scrambled mess of the show resulted in a greater sense of disappointment

no doubt the leads are the big attraction - but - to be frank - neither Hyun Bin nor my beloved Ha Ji Won are top actors - while Ji Won has managed to show a modicum of growth over the years - Hyun Bin remains a stick - but a tall stick that girls reeaaally like

i was expecting that about the acting however - so the cause of my disappointment comes with the story - a mishmash of genres that doesnt gel - its an amateurs idea of an innovative plot - so amateurish that between the new plot devices - the story lacked the slickness that needed to go with the glossy look

i was determined to watch to the end - and i found myself hoping for it to end soon - this agony was prolonged by there being 20 episodes rather than the typical 16

as usual with Korean tv - it has beautiful visuals - some good supporting actors

recommended for those who are Hyun Bin or Ha Ji Won fans - or those who want to be able to converse about it with K-Drama fandom - or those who want to spite me",1333411200,,1226,3.9274193548387095
4662093,4,B005DU58Q8,"This is a very fun drama full of body-swapping hijinks and unexpected relationships.  Occasionally the plot falters and leaves you scratching your head, but if you can tell yourself to just go with the flow I think you'll very much enjoy Secret Garden.  Both the lead actors do a great job at pretending be to the other lead character trapped inside the wrong body, and the backstory of the two second leads (Oska and Seul) gets more attention and depth than would be the case in many other K-dramas, where only the leads are faceted and the second leads end up being stock characters.

Fun fun fun as long as you don't over-analyze it.",1333065600,4,636,4.56140350877193
4662094,5,B005DU58Q8,"Korean dramas are usually well-made and quite lengthy.  Usually, they are usually 16 to 21 hours long- though there are many which are over 100 hours long.  Some people can sit down and watch them in one sitting, taking only occassional breaks.  ""The Secret Garden"" is one of the best Korean dramas ever made.

Upon watching ""The Secret Garden"", you will engulf on a journey- a rather long and enlightening journey.  You will experience tears, laughter, wonderment, love, scrutiny, etc.

Now, watching Korean drama is an acquired taste. You will either love them or dislike them.  You have to watch a few episodes to determine if you will like a particular drama.

""The Secret Garden"" is a masterpiece of a drama.  Also, the OST (Original Sound Track) is one of the best I have heard.  You do not have to understand the words (if you do not speak Korean) but you can still love the music.

If you watch Korean dramas on a regular basis, then you definitely should watch ""The Secret Garden"".  But, you can still enjoy this drama especially if you enjoy great and meaningful movies.

4662097,5,B005DU58Q8,"This is one of the first Korean dramas I ever watched, and it is the first one I bought. Not only does it have a great story line and soundtrack, but Hyun Bin's acting takes it to a whole new level. He was superb in both his roles, and the way he was able to change characters between Kim Joo Won and Gil Ra Im was phenomenal. Ha Ji Won and Hyun Bin also have great chemistry, and the side romances are really great too. This is one of those dramas that you can watch over and over again, and never get tired of it. Phrases and clothing from the drama influenced fads in Korea and phrases from this drama are still making appearances in other dramas currently airing (Jung Il Woo makes a reference to clothing sewn ""one by one"" in The Moon That Embraces the Sun).

Top notch acting really great stories. This one constantly turns and twists in the plot. It is nothing like the ones of role changing that have been done in American movies. They were stupid. This story make you laugh and cry. Constant cliff hangers and the end left me breathless. Just a wonderful story, top directing and great scenery.
