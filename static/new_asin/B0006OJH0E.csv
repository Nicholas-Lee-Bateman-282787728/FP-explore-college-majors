Beautifully draws the real meaning of friendship, love and family values but also keeps you at the edge of the seat in pain and tears by seeing that abusive cruel sick father. Superb!",1181001600,6,792,4.866666666666666

2190610,5,B0006OJH0E,"This multi-award-winning film tackles the difficult subject of domestic abuse and in particular a father's abusive relationship with his twelve-year-old son. The nature of this abuse is revealed slowly, so that like any outsider, we don't see the full extent of it until we've already formed opinions about both characters. The film contrasts their relationship with that of the boy's new friend at school, whose father is a tattoo artist and seems on the surface to be more potentially troublesome as a parent. But as we watch him with his son, we see how is firmness is an expression of his caring and love for the boy. The boys' two homes represent mirror worlds with contrasting emotional dynamics.

The drama in the film emerges as the abusive father's treatment of his son becomes gradually apparent to his son's friend, and we become informed of the near inability of anyone outside the family to rescue him. There is no easy resolution to this dilemma, and we are left with a sense of urgency about this disturbing social problem. The performances of the two twelve-year-olds are wonderful, as they become friends, exploring the early stages of their growing independence. Shot in the streets of Madrid, the film has a gritty, gray urban ambiance, and key scenes are played out along a railway where commuter trains rush by and schoolboys play death-defying games across the tracks.",1158537600,12,1390,4.965665236051502
2190611,1,B0006OJH0E,"This movie was a dissapointing waste of time. It showed that violence happens within family units and that not all people are bad. That's it. Dull, uninteresting, negative, with no moral or even ending to the story. Junk.",1142985600,,221,4.842105263157895
2190612,5,B0006OJH0E,This is Achero Maas first film and is really excellent! It won 4 Goyas awards including best picture and best emerging director. Is a very interesting stoy about fathers and sons and that no always what you see is what is true. Really an excellent buy!,1140998400,3,252,4.5
2190613,5,B0006OJH0E,"Child abuse, as incidents increase each year, is uncomforable for parents, which is why the topic is rarely filmed. It doesn't provide a feel-good experience, even with a happy ending, and most certainly it is not box office. With ""El Bola"" in 2000, some intrepid Spanish filmmakers took it on and didn't flinch. Their searing and sensitive low-budget movie, which indeed is uncomfortable to watch, won more than 30 top international awards, including four Goyas (Spain's Academy Award.) Its DVD release needs to be seen.

The scenes of physical, emotional and verbal abuse of a 12-year-old boy by his father, while his enabling wife protests feebly, are unsparing. The young victim is befriended by a classmate whose parents provide a caring contrast and who discover the abuse. The boy is rescued, yet his shocking monologue at the end will leave you uneasy long after the credits roll. You come to realize that undetected child abuse is so common that it is occurring even as you watch. The cast and crew are flawless and their little movie is unbearably moving.",1133049600,13,1065,4.949720670391062
2190614,5,B0006OJH0E,"This is a movie story that deals with two young boys, two families, and their two different worlds.  El Bola is the nickname for Pablo and he encounters a new boy, Alfredo, at school and their friendship drives them to discover each other's world.

Pablo's World
Pablo comes from a home where communication is sparse as he lives with his abusive authoritarian father, a weak mother, and a grandmother whose need for personal care only burdens the situation.  Pablo's father works in a hardware store and Pablo is often confined to work there also.  Before Pablo was born, the family lost a favorite son and now the frustration, anger and resentment is taken out on Pablo, who is brutally mistreated by his father.

It is only after the climactic abusive attack that Pablo runs away to Alfredo's family who then seek avenues to help the boy.  We don't know too much what happens after the abuse is discovered.  We do see Pablo discuss with the authorities the true horror he suffered.

On the other hand, Alfredo's family life is more caring and with communication.  An interest is shown in family structuring.  Contrary to the loving family life, Alfredo's father is a tattoo artist, considered a darker profession.  He also gives his young son a tattoo.

Pain and Scarring in different ways
According to the director, Archero Manas, the movie is not about child abuse, but he said the parellism is the two different ways pain and scaring are inflicted.  He said that the father who is a tattoo artist gives his young son a tattoo which is indicative of pain and scarring, while the abusive father inflicts pain and scarring through violence.

The DVD is clear and crisp with readable subtitles.  Included is ""The Making of El Bola"" as the children, cast talk about their characters while the director gives insight to his film.  The movie has won numerous awards, including La Goya in 2000, which is equivalent to an Academy Award.

8042116,4,B0006OJH0E,"El Bola or `the pellet' is the nickname given to young Pablo - he carries a ball bearing for good luck. He has a miserable home life where he is forced to help care for his incontinent and ageing grandmother, work in his fathers shop, his father is a vicious tyrant who beats him for any reason and is a control freak par excellence and his mother is indifferent. Across this ensemble is cast the shadow of his elder dead brother - whose place El Bola should be in - according to his father.

Then one day a new boy enters the class - despite the initial rejection by the other boys, Bola sees something in him and starts a friendship. He then discovers a family who have many problems and despite the parents being separated they come across as balanced and loving both to each other and their children. This is something Bola has not experienced before and the friendship blossoms. Then his father finds out and bans him from any further contact - the beatings increase in ferocity too and everything starts building for a denouement - but who will be the ultimate victim?

This is an extremely well made film with an outstanding performance from Juan Jose Ballesta (`Bruc') as El Bola and a supporting cast that all put in fine performances. Director Achero Maas has taken the difficult subject of parental abuse and tackled it in a believable and still upsetting way. For anyone who suffered at the hands of a parent this will be an uncomfortable watch. The embarrassment factor is one that I can still remember having had a father with similar inclinations, and this is all captured along with the hugely violent mood swings and the seemingly innocuous things that can trigger the violence from the father.

It is hard to say I enjoyed this film for reasons as stated, but it has made a lasting impression and is well worth hunting down - it came out in 2000. It is in Spanish with good subtitles and a run time of an hour and a half - not an easy watch but ultimately a rewarding one.",1446249600,,1990,4.476584022038567
8042117,5,B0006OJH0E,"The performances of the two central boys, and the cast around them ring absolutely true to my understanding of what happens in the situation 'El Bola' finds himself in, and I predict that both young actors will go far. Many will ask why the mother didn't intervene, and will say that no mother in real life would stand by; sadly this film is true to life. The mother would have been ground down for years, to the point of being impotent to do anything. For the first half, this film has a nihilistic feel of futility to it. It is heart-breaking, but also life-affirming.

The film is unrated in America, but the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) Rating, legally required for movies released in Britain, is 15. That means it is rated unsuitable for anyone below the age of 15.",1414108800,,785,4.567375886524823

8042119,4,B0006OJH0E,"Although most people speak mainly, if not only, of the child abuse in this movie the true theme of the movie the friendship between Pablo and Alfredo. The director verifies this in the ""Making of 'El Bola'"" which is included on the DVD. (ASIN: B0006OJH0E in case this review is included on move than one version of ""El Bola"".)

As I see it Pablo is drawn to danger, that is what he likes about his friends at the beginning of the movie, the well dressed and supposedly well adjusted boys with whom he plays a deadly game on the railroad tracks. I think that is also why he so quickly tries to befriend the new kid Alfredo, Alfredo looks like trouble. But the movie is filled with contrasts and anti-stereotypes. At the same time not everything or everybody in the movie is clear-cut as good or bad. Under today's laws in the United States Alfredo's father could also be charged with child abuse. Also the legal advise Alfredo's father gets after he learns of Pablo's abuse defies common sense and puts both Alfredo and his father in a major conflict.

The movie is a decent drama, well acted and well produced with a fair amount of action, suspense, etc. One abuse scene, demonstrating just how bad the situation is, is intense.

The DVD also includes a six minute and twenty-three second stop-motion film. The charters reminded me of E.T. from Steven Spielberg's film, but this was probably not the filmmaker's intent. It was interesting but not really anything special.",1407196800,,1471,4.671814671814672
8042120,5,B0006OJH0E,"This is not an easy movie to watch.

8042121,4,B0006OJH0E,"Films thrive on parallel universes, and writer/director Achero Ma&ntilde;as' El Bola takes full advantage of contrasting two fathers and their family lives through the eyes of their sons. Although the Spanish film won four Goya Awards in 2000 for Best Emerging Director, Best Emerging Actor, Best Screenplay, and Best Film, it was ignored by American theaters until now.. Although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of Spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse, the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching.

Part of what makes the film compelling are the first rate performances by its young cast. Pablo aka El Bola (Juan Jos&eacute; Ballesta) is a twelve year old living in Madrid. His life radically changes when he meets Alfredo (Pablo Gal&aacute;n) a new boy who joins his class. What follows is a comparison of two parallel family situations that remain ambiguous enough to keep the careful viewer wondering what exactly is going on in the  families and the motivation for Pablo's father Mariano's (Manuel Mor&oacute;n) extreme violence towards his young son.

In contrast is the homelife of Alfredo, a bohemian mix of couples that are willing to show their child the love and affection  that is missing in Pablo's life. Alfredo's family atmosphere is completely foreign to Pablo--a much more relaxed, loving, and accepting bohemian lifestyle that appeals greatly to the boy. Exactly what the relationships are between the adults in Alfredo's family remain unstated--a gay subtext may or may not exist, as the family certainly are friends with many homosexuals who have died from AIDS. Alfredo's father, Jos&eacute; (Alberto Jim&eacute;nez), makes a living as a tattoo artist and anchors the extended family. The filmmaker leaves his sexuality ambiguous, which is irrelevant to the two boys--he's a levelheaded, caring father who has their best interests at heart.

El Bola is at its heart a story of friendship between two young boys and the devestating effects of parental abuse. While the film is not always easy to watch it is very well made and well worth a viewing if not only for the story presented but for the questions it raises.

Film Movement chose this film as its debut installment and presents the film with a making of documentary and the short film More by Mark Osborne.",1310342400,,2369,5.14025974025974
8042122,5,B0006OJH0E,"I just watched El Bola on the Sundance Channel. Normally I don't like reviewing movies, because they're such a personal preference. But I must say that El Bola was a very powerful, moving film. This is definitely not a fun film - children getting beat is no laughing manner. It was amazing to see the way that the law handles the subject in Spain vs. the U.S.

I thought all of the actors were fantastic. The boys' performances were exceptional, especially given their young age. They really drew you into the story and made it feel ""real"".

Now, having said all of that, I don't know if I would actually purchase the DVD. It's one of those movies that, due to its quasi-depressing nature, I wouldn't want to watch over again. However, I must say that El Bola is definitely a 5-star movie worth watching. El Bola is a film that will stay with you for awhile.",1220140800,3,858,4.45859872611465
8042123,5,B0006OJH0E,"Pablo (Juan Jose Ballesta), known by his friends as ""Pellet"", is ruled by a tyrannical and abusive father. Pellet pales as he tries to grow up under the shadow of a dead brother, but remains a deeply empathetic and sensitive child. When classmates pick on the new kid, Alfredo (Pablo Galan), Pellet befriends him and is consequently introduced to a gentle and fun version of family life centered around Alfredo's sweet father Jose.  You don't learn the extent of Pellet's abuse until the last few seconds of the film and you're left wondering how anyone who endured such depravity could have been so sweet. This film won more than 30 international awards, including four Spanish Goyas, all of them well-deserved. At times I completely forgot I was watching a movie and that the actors were acting. Engrossing and tender.

8042124,4,B0006OJH0E,"""El Bola"" is a powerful movie from Spain.  In 2000, it was director Achero Manas' first full-length feature after having directed a handful of short film projects.  It handles the powder keg issue of child abuse with realism.  Juan Jose Ballesta plays Pablo, nicknamed ""Pellet.""  At filming, I believe he was 12.  Juan had played on Spanish TV, but this was his first feature.  He has worked consistently in Spanish films in the seven years since.  He breaks your heart with those eyes that reflect the joy, innocence and love of a child and contrasts with the utter fear for his life.  The culminating incident where he spits in his father's face blows the lid off.  We know what's coming and watch as the helpless mother flails about pathetically.

Pablo's best friend is Alfredo, played by Pablo Galan.  Galan was chosen from 1,600 children who auditioned.  He had no previous acting experience.  He's a bit heavyset; & his Alfredo is an oddball & loner.  Galan was well chosen.  He moves effortlessly between the young adolescent alienation, to wild abandon as he crashes the amusement park rides, to sober contemplation as he sees the family friend dying of AIDS.

Beside Ballesta's Pablo, Alberto Jimenez makes the greatest impression as Jose, the father of best friend Pablo.  Jose is a tattoo artist.  We first view him as wild, tattooing a dragon on fat man's back.  As his screen time increases, we see a father who listens to his family, treats his wife & children well and cares about them and his friends.  Jose stands up for Pablo, taking risks on the boys' behalf.  By the film's end, he is our hero.  With six films shot in 2007, Jimenez has had a busy career in Spanish cinema since this film from 2000.

Our villain is Pablo's father Mariano, played by Manuel Moron.  The Film Movement DVD explains that the character is sad because of the loss of his first son.  However, no explanation suffices for the loveless home life this father creates.  I found it interesting that the Film Movement DVD lists stage training and productions for Moron in Spain & Argentina.  Moron plays this controlling parent perfectly; and we hate him for it.

Of the smaller roles, all characters are well directed and fill the film realistically.  Ana Wagener, who to me looks a bit like Melissa Etheridge's Spanish sister, plays the social worker Laura who advises Alfredo's family on how to handle the situation.  Maximo Jimenez plays Pablo's friend Cobeta, a good looking lad who plays a game of rushing onto the railroad tracks before an oncoming train to grab a bottle.  Gloria Munoz plays Aurora, Pablo's helpless mother who cannot stop her husband's abuse.

The screenplay leaves an open-ended conclusion.  The events have been so disturbing that perhaps we all hope for the best.  We could either interpret that things will get better for Pablo or that the father will get away with his domestic abuse.  Perhaps in this situation, no one can actually win.  This is a powerful film that should be viewed by mature audiences.  May our angels around the world help children from every culture who find themselves helpless and attacked.",1182384000,3,3137,4.807116104868914
