These episodes are just like she described. I'm very pleased",1359158400,,144,4.576923076923077

4596796,5,B0057IY5CE,"I haven't watched this as yet so I really can't comment on the content; but if you like Betty White, I'm sure you'll like her first steps in the business.",1357171200,,154,4.166666666666667
4596797,5,B0057IY5CE,Purchased for mother-in-law but I'm sure it will end up being passed around the family. I am not a 'celebrity' follower but I love Betty White and admire the causes she fights for.,1356220800,,180,4.484848484848484
4596798,5,B0057IY5CE,"Betty White was a TV pioneer and had a big influence on the TV explosion of the 50s. She hosted her own variety show and was the first woman to produce her own shows. This set of 4 DVDs contains 24 episodes from her first series, Life With Elizabeth (her first Emmy win), and 16 episodes from her second series, Date With The Angels. All charming and comical. Also included is a short documentary of Betty's TV career, up to Hot in Cleveland, which she co stars for the 4th season. Just an amazingly energetic lady who at nearly 91, still combines her career with her animal activism. Delightful look back at the making of a star.",1353715200,10,630,4.3931623931623935
4596799,5,B0057IY5CE,I enjoyed this DVD.  I have always liked Betty White in all her TV shows and movies.  She is a lovely lady and very funny!,1350864000,2,122,3.84
4596800,5,B0057IY5CE,Betty White is my all-time favorite actress. This is a good compilation of her work. This is a must have for all fans.,1330473600,,118,4.173913043478261
4596801,5,B0057IY5CE,These were the shows where I frist saw Betty White and they are as good now as then. Fine quality picture and sound for early TV programs.,1325894400,8,138,4.148148148148148
4596802,5,B0057IY5CE,"My mother in law loved this set. Betty White is a flavor of the month these days, but we've always liked her. The DVDs played well. Since I ordered this for her I'm not sure exactly what is on it, but the thing is, they worked.",1325635200,2,227,3.9565217391304346
4596803,1,B0057IY5CE,"My wife and I have both really enjoyed Betty White over the last 10-15 years, so I bought these for my wife's birthday. They were extremely disappointing to both of us. The settings and dialogues were so flat, cheap and boring we couldn't stand to watch more than about 5 episodes. Finally tossed them and I am getting another gift for the wife.

These might be interesting from a historical viewpoint, but entertaining, they are NOT!",1422489600,,434,4.7105263157894735
4596804,5,B0057IY5CE,"My wife is the real Betty White fan in this house. She has not watched all of these DVDs but has probably seen every Golden Girls episode twice or more often. I have to concede that I have seen brief moments in the ""... Girls"" series, always at my wife's behest and Betty plays her part well. From her gales of laughter I hear all the way down the hall from our TV room, I think my wife would highly recommend this DVD collection from the ""Funny Lady.""",1421625600,,452,4.1477272727272725
4596805,4,B0057IY5CE,"Fantastic price to have so many episodes of these classic Betty White shows. ""Life with Elizabeth""  usually has 3 vignettes, or ""incidents"" and moves rather quickly. Very enjoyable.  Del Moore co-starred as her husband. He sadly passed away circa 1970 in his mid-fifties, but google his daughter Lesli Moore, who has a tale of her own stemming from her experience entertaining troops during the Vietnam war, which sadly changed her life forever.  Anyway, ""Date With the Angels"" is probably my favorite of the two shows offered here, but Betty White is a sheer delight in both!  Can't beat the price on this entertaining release! Thank you, Mill Creek.",1420588800,,651,5.0

4596807,1,B0057IY5CE,"This disk is of OLD TV shows, not very good by today's standards. I didn't find them funny or worth watching after viewing several shows, put disk on the shelf, to sell at a lawn sale.",1412467200,,184,4.138888888888889
4596808,1,B0057IY5CE,so bad not even good enough to watch,1409184000,,36,3.625
4596809,5,B0057IY5CE,Great DVD for the price.  I loved Betty White in the 80's from the Golden Girls.  She is so funny and such a great actress. Great collection.,1406419200,,141,4.185185185185185
4596810,4,B0057IY5CE,"How can you go wrong, this is a good DVD, who doesn't love Betty White.  Loved remembering all these shows.",1399420800,,107,4.35
4596811,4,B0057IY5CE,"Betty White is an American legend; an icon; a comedic genius; actress; animal rights activist; humanitarian; and star for decades on television and in film. She has also done radio and stage too. There is no reason that 7 time Emmy winner Betty White isn't given America's highest honor of being a Kennedy Center Honoree.

In this four disc set, you will see her infamous role in the fifties sitcom, ""Life with Elizabeth, in the title role of course and Del Moore as her long suffering husband, Alvin. While this sitcom has announcer who talks to Elizabeth and she replies non-verbally to him. The announcer will ask ""Elizabeth, aren't you ashamed of yourself?"" And she replies non-verbally of course not. The first two discs feature the season of the show with ten episodes apiece.

The last four episodes of ""Life with Elizabeth"" is on the third disc. The third and fourth discs features 16 episodes of a later sitcom, ""A Date with an Angel,"" where she plays newlywed Vicki Angel. Bill Williams plays her husband, Gus.

Of the two sitcoms here, I prefer Betty White as Vicki Angel. Her first sitcom has Alvin and Elizabeth most of the time with little interaction from neighbors, relatives, or friends. With the Angels, there is more socialization with friends and neighbors which makes it more real.

The DVDs here are a fine quality but remember that quality and preservation by time may have affected the final result. Still it is worth seeing both shows at least once.

The last disc features an uninspired documentary about Betty White made with an unknown narrator and shown clips of ""Life with Elizabeth.""",1397606400,6,1614,4.833333333333333
4596812,5,B0057IY5CE,BETTY WHITE WAS IN SO MANY GREAT COMEDY SERIES. TO MANY TO NAME. i AM GLAD THAT I FOUND THIS COLLECTION.,1393459200,,104,4.0
4596813,3,B0057IY5CE,"The dvds are from early tv shows of Betty White, which I don't remember.  They are humorous, but not up to par with her later work.",1382918400,,131,4.038461538461538
4596814,5,B0057IY5CE,I think this DVD is  great.  It has  both  series  Life with Elizabeth  and  Date with the Angels series.  I really enjoyed  Date with the Angels  the best.  If you like Betty While you should really enjoy  this DVD.,1380585600,,216,4.256410256410256
4596815,5,B0057IY5CE,"I haven't  watched all the dvds in this collection as yet  but if you never saw a young Betty White and how amazing she was (and still is) you will enjoy seeing these shows where Betty started her career. She used to be on different game shows and met her husband who was a host  (Alan Luden) of one of the popular  game shows of the times and after his death she never married again though I'll bet she had a zillion proposals.  Betty's first tv sitcom is in black and white and a very young Betty has that same smile and wit that she has now. These tapes show her start in TV land and why the public and all of Hollywood fell in love with her then and continues to be in love with her now. Though Betty is 91 she  still  has the same spectacular personality; is a  hard worker with those 'can't resist' smile and dimples. For all who love her in Hot in Cleveland (she is absolutely fantastic) and other recent shows these tapes reflect the enormous talent Betty has and the same smile with her famous eye 'flutter' that always gets her anything she wants....it's still there now as it was then! She is simply  one remarkable lady. Betty is a champion to all that know her, that worked with her and those that watch her - who could resist Betty--she is such a special lady!!!!!!! The price for this set  is more than fair  and looking back over Betty's career is an eye opener--how can one little lady be so talented? Well Betty White can!!!! Probably the hardest worker in TV-land! If you adore Betty-you will love her even more!! You can't go wrong with this set; you can only remember 'when' or see them for the first time for all you young'uns!!!",1380412800,,1651,4.2935483870967746
4596816,5,B0057IY5CE,"Betty is a talent and a kindred soul.  Regardless of the life she's led and all the acclaim she's received, she will always be cherished now and in the future and this collection proves it.",1375747200,,189,4.4
4596817,5,B0057IY5CE,"After watching Betty White on ""Golden Girls"", I vaguely remembered her having her own tv series years ago.  I found many of them on Amazon.  She is just as beautiful now at 91 as she was when her Betty White shows aired many years ago.  I can only describe her as ""zaney"" & funny, and the shows as very nostalgic.  I am glad I was able to find her old tv shows on Amazon.  Besides buying a set for myself,  I also bought two more sets as gifts.",1375142400,,444,3.9886363636363638
4596818,5,B0057IY5CE,Bought this for a friend for her birthday and she loved it. We watched it and it was so great seeing Betty as a young woman. We grew up watching the Golden Girls so it was fun to see her before that time period.,1371513600,,211,3.8181818181818183
4596819,1,B0057IY5CE,"We all love Betty White. This DVD is mostly about ''Life with Elizabeth'' which I am not familiar with at all. I thought it would be a documentary about her life and her roles in ''The Mary Tyler Moore show'' and ',The Golden Girls'' etc.... sorry.",1360281600,,248,4.413043478260869
4596820,4,B0057IY5CE,"Betty White is seemingly more popular today than she has ever been before.  One of the most talented and feted comediennes to ever grace the small screen, audiences have cheered Betty through countless decades of solid TV entertainment.  This bargain-priced set from Mill Creek collects 40 episodes from Betty White's 1950s TV vehicles LIFE WITH ELIZABETH and DATE WITH THE ANGELS.

Running between 1953-55, LIFE WITH ELIZABETH revolved around ordinary housewife Elizabeth (White) and her husband Alvin (Del Moore). In quite a bold step, storylines took on a non-linear pattern, with the on-screen narrator (future game show host Jack Narz) taking us through various ""incidents"" in Elizabeth and Alvin's marriage, as opposed to regular 25-minute, self-contained stories. In the early days of TV sitcoms it was highly unusual, and still is largely unheard-of today! This was, at least, partly done because the producers weren't sure if they wanted to syndicate the whole show or just highlights from certain episodes.

LIFE WITH ELIZABETH originated at the Los Angeles station KLAC-TV in 1952, where both White and Moore were employed at the time. The show started out being aired live with a studio audience as part of a larger, five-hour block of variety entertainment. White won her first Emmy Award for her performance as Elizabeth.  24 episodes of LIFE WITH ELIZABETH are included in this set.

DATE WITH THE ANGELS (1957-58) casts Betty as Vickie Angel, another trouble-prone housewife, with Bill Williams as her husband Gus.  It's quite close in spirit to the earlier ELIZABETH (including several of the same creative and production staff), but it is a more polished production - situation comedy had come a long way in the few short years between ELIZABETH and ANGELS.  Once more it's Betty's charm and spirit that elevates the stories, which involve a fun gallery of wacky friends and neighbours (Natalie Masters, Maudie Prickett, Richard Deacon, Nancy Kulp, Burt Mustin, Richard Reeves and Roy Engel).  Most of the 16 episodes included also have their original sponsorship material from Plymouth.

Episodes:

The Feud
The Wheel
Chip Off the Old Block
Pike's Pique
A Tree on the Parkway
Return of the Wheel
Everybody's Baby
The Train
Day at the Races
Diana
Francis Goes to School
Double Trouble
High Fever
The Burglar
The Gorilla
The Blue Tie

The ""bonus documentary"" isn't anything special.  An onscreen host reveals several generic background facts which anybody could look up on IMDB or Wikipedia whilst several clips from the episodes included are used as padding. It's a nice inclusion but doesn't really reveal anything we haven't learned or seen before.",1359763200,4,2668,5.176744186046512
4596821,3,B0057IY5CE,"Its's fun to see a review of Betty White's long career, seeing her hint-of-mischief eyes and beguiling dimples. A person my age also just enjoys reminders of the ol' black-and-white low-pixel-count screens of childhood. Betty is a good match for Lucy in that respect, with typical lines and situations popular in early sitcoms. Her wit is evident in the mid-years, and even today, she's the wry star of whatever scene of interview she's in. What a career! What a life! Quiz shows included in the fun.  My enjoyment didn't last through too many old bits of early stuff, slightly discouraging me from inserting the next disc after the first. But skimming along works fine. I had an overall wish that the whole presentation had been ""tightened"" up in a documentary style, especially the eary stuff.",1359331200,,795,4.888888888888889
4596822,2,B0057IY5CE,"i guess I didn't read the description carefully enough.  The TV shows on this set are poor quality, and iI have no memory of them and i am OLD!
