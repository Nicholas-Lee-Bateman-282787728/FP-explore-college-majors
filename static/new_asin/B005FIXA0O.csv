4679643,2,B005FIXA0O,"I was hoping for a fairly good movie but this one turns out to be on the ""shot straight to video"" level. It just didn't quite look like a movie to me. The acting wasn't what even I would call ""good"". The plot (if it can be called that) was pretty lame also. I usually see films as ""entertainment"" and ignore most critic's reviews as just their ""opinion"". However, with this film... I don't think there would be much of a critic review available to even consider thinking about it! I, for one, most likely will pass this movie along as I am NOT inclined to see it again... ever... even in my dreams!! The front cover looked kinda cool though!",1359676800,4,641,4.305785123966942

It's obvious that the budget is small but they made it work.  I am glad that I gave Pirates: Quest for Snake Island a chance because it was worth the hour and 15+ minutes.

4679674,5,B005FIXA0O,"Look, you don't go to Community Theatre productions expecting Broadway level entertainment. If you do, you're going to come away disappointed and jaded about the experience. This movie was FREE with my Prime Membership and so I gave it a try. Besides, who am I to come along and trash someone's work? That being said, it's my review, so I'll use it any way I see fit. And that means being constructive.

Crowd funding is all the rage and something like this is a perfect candidate for that kind of fundraising. If Mr. Kelly had another $5,000 to spend on this project, I think the result would have been much more professional. He does an admirable job with what he has to work with, and since I gave this movie 5 stars and this is my review, I'm going to tell him how he could have spent that five grand to make PIRATES: QUEST FOR SNAKE ISLAND a better film. These are in no particular order.

1. Hire a real writer to work on the script. The dialogue is terrible.
2. The costumes look like they were borrowed from a local community theatre. A few accessories would have gone a long way. And for God's sake...
3. Dirty everyone up! A little dirt, make-up, whatever, would have gone a long way towards giving this a more realistic look. Dirt is cheap. Dirt cheap in fact!!! Were you guys afraid you wouldn't get your deposit back if you got the costumes dirty? If so, here's a piece of advice, go to your local Goodwill or equivalent and get some old clothes and tear them up. They would have looked more realistic anyway.
4. Why is everyone so clean shaven? Even the guys with beards have nice clean edges. Ugh...
5. ...and look at those pretty white teeth!!! Come on Brett, details, man! Why is everyone so pale? Sun is FREE too! Pale pirates???
6. The stock footage looks pretty good, but it's over used and needs to be slowed down in places. The town setting is nice, but instead of filming at the lake, GET IN YOUR CAR AND DRIVE TO THE OCEAN!!! FIlm a scene and then drive home. You don't have to be rich to visit the ocean. You obviously had a little money to work with.
7. The green screen stuff doesn't work and cheapens your film. Find an old wooden shed and film that on board stuff below decks.
8. The best and frankly, ONLY believable actor in the whole thing is the tattooed pirate.
9. Does everyone have to use the same shiny swords?
10. The sea monster. M. Night Shyamalan would be the way to go here. Less is more when you're working on a shoe string budget.

Like I said, it's my review, so there are ten points to make the PIRATES film better along with 5 stars to help boost your numbers a bit. Perhaps I'll revisit the movie and this review later.",1407456000,,2667,4.33

4679683,5,B005FIXA0O,"So I was scrolling through the ""genres"" section of Amazon Prime streaming, and under the category of ""Pirates"" I saw this title.  Thinking it was the softcore actioner, I clicked on it, only to discover that it was, according to critics, a rather horrible and amateurish attempt by an indie filmmaker from the Great White North.  One review, however, referred to it as ""so bad, it's good,"" so I thought I'd give it a shot.

The movie is awful.  Laughably awful.  But-gustingly, hilariously awful in nearly every respect.  Now, there are bad movies, and there are bad movies.  If you don't get the reference from the title, Tommy Wiseau is the writer/producer/director of the celebrated and maligned cult favorite ""The Room"" (2003).  I don't know if Brett Kelly drew any inspiration from Wiseau's masterpiece of the bizarre, but this film is (or at least can be, to the right person under the right circumstances) every bit as entertaining.  Brett Kelly's entertainment company has its own website (shown in the end credits), which seems to celebrate the unrepentant schlockiness of his repertoire.  I look forward to checking out other instant classics from Brett Kelly Entertainment, like ""Bonesetter,"" ""My Fair Zombie"" and ""Homicycle.""

Now to the movie itself.  Kelly, as writer and director, saves money and feeds his ego by starring as John ""Blackjack"" Cutter, a pirate (sorry, privateer) in an unspecified time and location, but could probably be defined as ""pirate times, somewhere in wherever other pirate movies usually take place.""  Cutter opens the film by walking in slo-mo, knee-deep in the briny, toward a beach, introducing himself, and warning us gentle viewers that this tale ""begins with a treasure map and a boy...A BEGGAR BOY.""

Cue titles and begin opening action sequence:  a beggar boy named Jacob (the actor's name isn't listed on the IMDb page, and I'm too lazy to scroll through the end credits again) begs for handouts, while another character (who is never named) runs through an old-looking village that was probably within driving distance of their homes in Ottawa.  A sinister, eyepatched villian named Deadeye (Frank Rothery), who has a kind of Billy Idol/Rob Halford look going on, yells a warning to the fleeing man that he'll never escape.

Jacob finds a barn and curls up for a nap under a wagon; the stranger runs up to him, flings a rolled-up parchment at him, and is promptly shot in the back by Deadeye (for breakin' the law, breakin' the law...sorry).  Jacob scurries away as Deadeye looks for the parchment.  Meanwhile, Cutter is in the stately bedroom of Victoria, his true love (no, he really means it this time), who also happens to be the governor's daughter.  As she begs him to stay, her father (who looks like William Hickey in a judge's wig) storms upstairs with two red-coated, tri-corner-hatted guards.  Cutter leaps out of the window, fights the guards and escapes; the governor assures Victoria that Cutter will soon be dead.

But I'm not doing the narrative justice.  Let's begin with Brett Kelly.  In his tall headband, long, straight blond hair and puffy shirt, he pulls off a fairly good Brett Michaels (if Brett Michaels got hit by a truck).  It's actually more of a Bret-Michaels-plus-this-stoner-guy-I-knew-in-high-school effect, but you get the idea.  Kelly is clearly going for the charming rogue motif, and he mostly pulls it off, but his muddled Irish accent detracts from much of his performance.  I think he workshopped it by watching Brad Pitt in ""The Devil's Own,"" Tom Cruise in ""Far and Away,"" and a whole lot of Lucky Charms commercials.

Amanda Leigh as Victoria...hmm, well...she's very good-looking.  She wears a thrift store wedding dress in every scene, and her accent was acquired by...well, I assume it was from hearing other bad actresses mangle English accents.  She drifts in and out of the accent throughout the movie, dipping into a heavy cockney for some lines, and even imitating Kelly's impostor brogue in a few of their scenes.  Other than that, well...she's very pretty.

The actor who played the Governor (again, not in the IMDb credits) must be an old guy who does local theater, or maybe he's a minister.  He manages to deliver the lines cleanly enough, and mug for the camera after each line, but he could have had so much more fun with this character.  His most entertaining moment is when he tells his guards to go after Cutter, then as they walk away, he robotically turns to the camera, grins evilly and puts his hand under his chin.  I can see Kelly giving him his direction, and then he just follows it to a T.  Beautiful!

The dialogue in this scene sets the tone for much of what you'll be hearing for the rest of the film.  There are a handful of decent gags, one or two that actually made me smile, but it's mostly awful.  It sounds like Kelly just watched the Johnny Depp movies and jotted down cool lines, Googled ""pirate era talk,"" and threw the rest together from a pirate short story he wrote in his treehouse in the 3rd grade.

There are several fight sequences, each involving groin kicks, pistol-whips, and the kind of swordplay you would expect from a movie of this caliber:  utter crap.  They quite literally look like they're having fun, ching-chinging their swords together in the most rudimentary, playground fashion.  I almost expected the credits to read ""Fight Coreographer:  Nobody.""  There was no credit for fight coreographer.

The story, such as it is, is at least coherent enough to follow.  Jacob goes to a local pub (a real pub, with real modern lighting and posters on the wall) and asks a barmaid (producer Anne-Marie Frigon) to direct him to a ship for hire, for he has a treasure map, you see.  She scoffs and replies, milking her cockney accent for all it's worth, that his map is probably a fake.  However, Blackjack Cutter, brooding in the corner like a Chewbacca-less Han Solo, invites the boy over, offering to take him to the allegedly-cursed ""snake island.""

Meanwhile, a rival pirate named Killian (John Collins), sits in another pub, mumbling about how he'll get that Blackjack Cutter, the miserable swab.  Killian is my favorite character.  He looks and talks like the Governor from ""The Walking Dead,"" if someone gave him a whole bunch of sleeping pills, but his best feature is his wardrobe.  He straight-up dresses like a Mexican Space Pimp.

That's right, I said a Mexican Space Pimp.  If you go back and look through the archives of exploitation flicks of the 70s, and you find one that has a Mexican Space Pimp character, he will be wearing almost the exact same outfit.  It's beautiful, and it gives his every scene (and for that matter, the whole movie) a time-jumping, surrealist feel.

Surrealism is further poured down our throats with the oft-mentioned CGI and green-screen pirate ship sets.  The other reviews warned me, but I just wasn't prepared for how gut-wrenchingly cheap and unprofessional this looks.  Again, it's so utterly bad, it's hilarious.  I can't imagine Kelly looking at this and going ""This is so real,"" even for 2008.  The actors all crowd together in front of the green-screen:  Cutter, Victoria and Jacob in front of one backdrop that looks kinda like a ship, and the four or five crew members standing in front of another.

Oh, but before they get on the ship, they are attacked by Deadeye and his associates; they all had names in the credits, but I just started nicknaming them ""Hodor,"" ""Bill Murray's Brother,"" ""Hercule Poirot meets Major General Stanley,"" etc.  On Killian's ship, they showed only one crew member, a mute with a twitchy nose who looks like a cross between Lister from ""Red Dwarf"" and the lead singer from ""4 Non-blondes.""  However, when Killian confronts our heroes on the island, he has his original crew (minus twitchy).  I guess they had to work around these guys' schedules at the hockey puck factory or something.

The environment on Snake Island doesn't seem to help nail down the general vicinity of where any of this is supposed to take place.  Since ye olde towne scenes were filmed in a place that looks roughly like New England, one would assume the island was somewhere in the North Atlantic.  I'm not a snake expert, but I would think that a place snakey enough to be called ""Snake Island"" would be somewhere tropical, like, oh...the Carribean.  But, if that's the case, it would require some explanation as to why the island's flora included a number of coniferous trees.  But maybe that's just me being nitpicky.

There is a horribly cheesy CGI snake-eel-dragon thingy on the island (hence the name!), the design for which must have come from a crumpled-up doodle found in JK Rowling's wastepaper basket.  It kills everyone except Cutter, Victoria and Jacob, who, although they don't find the treasure of snake island, do find lots of dubloons aboard Killian's ship when they steal it at the end.  Oh, spoiler alert.

I should also acknowledge the other actors in the film, playing guards, tavern patrons, etc; they were apparently culled from Kelly's pool of friends, well-wishers and college classmates (I'm assuming he takes a cooking class or something.  It just seems like that's how he'd roll).  Overall, I really do appreciate guys like Brett Kelly, who go out there and make their own damn movies, without waiting for Hollywood to discover them.  In this day and age, with technology what it is, there's no reason in the world why indie filmmakers can't have some measure of success.  So Brett, if you read this, no hard feelings, and best to you in your endeavors.

One last note:  although the acting, script, special effects and camera work is mostly terrible, I have to give props to the editing and the music.  They were actually pulled off pretty decently.  ""Pirates:  The Quest for Snake Island"" is the funniest, if unintentionally so, film I've seen since ""The Room,"" and if you like goodbad cinema, this one is for you.  Enjoy!",1395705600,5,9954,4.850622406639004

4679689,2,B005FIXA0O,"The acting is bad.  That is the worst thing about this video, and there are many more things wrong with this video. But the acting, is truly the worst. There is no emotion, no real animation to their faces, nothing to really make one character different from the other aside from the clothes they are wearing.

The plot is strange and it is very obvious what is going to happen from the first minute you watch this movie.

Here are the reasons I gave it two stars though- It's a pirate movie. My 9, going on ten, year old son who LOVES pirates enjoyed it and said it was good. That is worth one star for keeping him entertained one day while waiting  for me to finish up some business. One star for effort because it is bovious that this is an Indy film. And mostly, the shooting was very creative. You get close ups of beaches with little crabs crawling about, shots of the tops of trees, and in and of itself the shooting of the video made it interesting to watch for a while.

I would not spend one penny on this video. I do not believe it is worth that. I wouldn't completely write it off though if you had a young pirate loving type of boy (or girl) in your home.

Cinematography was sometimes amazing and sometimes completely off.  Editing could use some bigger cuts.  Action scenes could have been longer and clearer as to what is going on.  The effort for this low budget production was excellent!

Unfortunately, what really kills this movie was the accents.  It just makes it so hard to watch this film.  The best acting came from the main villain near the end.  His accent was actually pretty good.  I'm not an expert at accents, but my ears bleed when British accents aren't done well.  The secondary pirate with the eye patch sounded great, but visually it didn't seem natural to his performance.  In fact, I'd rather a pirate movie without the accents and an amazing story.
