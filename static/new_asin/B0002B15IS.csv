2075614,5,B0002B15IS,"My kids have watched this movie over and over. They are a 6 yr old boy and 9 yr old girl. They both race motocross and my son rides a cobra just like the monkey. He loves seeing that monkey ride ""his"" bike. They have watched this countless times!",1201651200,,246,4.040816326530612
2075615,5,B0002B15IS,"I spent way too much money renting this movie over and over again.  I didn't think that I would be able to find it, but Amazon had it and delivered it fast.  My boys (5 and 9 years old) love this movie and I am glad that I was able to find it.",1194912000,5,243,3.5660377358490565
2075616,3,B0002B15IS,"This reminded me of some kind of ABC After School Special.  That's all I expected, so I wasn't disappointed.  It's just a good little movie about some kids racing to save the family farm and motocross track.  Lorenzo Lamas is servicable, as is Grizzly Adams.  The kids are cute.  The monkey angle is funny and I bet your kids will laugh.  The younger they are the better.

This will make them want to either go outside and ride their bmx bikes or their dirt bikes or atvs.  And get a pet monkey.",1154908800,4,495,4.304347826086956
2075617,5,B0002B15IS,We rented this movie and watched it a dozen times with my kids (ages 4-6).  We kept it well past the return date and now we will end up buying it on amazon.  The kids are talented little actors and this was a nice movie for the family.  I can't count the number of times that little chimp made my 4 year old twins giggle and cheer.  Great job.,1144022400,,343,3.927536231884058
2075618,4,B0002B15IS,This action movie is an excellent movie for children who like the outdoors and riding bikes.  A cute chimpanzie steals the show so see it now.,1122163200,5,142,4.461538461538462
2075619,5,B0002B15IS,"Great movie,my grandson and I have watched it many times, he really enjoys it. Has a lot of well known actors",1360108800,,109,4.238095238095238

2075622,5,B0002B15IS,My wife bought this movie because of Hunger Games. Aperantly Peata is in this movie. She did not check IMDB but just wanted it because of Peata.,1339632000,,144,4.37037037037037
2075623,4,B0002B15IS,"You know, it wasn't bad at all, totally suitable for the younger age groups and funny.  Acting was a bit cheesy at times, but overall a good family flick.",1323734400,,154,4.310344827586207
2075624,3,B0002B15IS,"This movie features Lorenzo Lamas as a Motocross coach who teaches kids how to ride. The film has a somewhat implausible script (a chimpanzee as a motocross star), but it does provide some good motocross action scenes which older kids will probably like. It also features great performances by child actors Josh Hutcherson and Bobby Preston. The major point of the plot centers on a race pitting the kids at the motocross training track against the kids of a nasty motorcycle gang. At stake is ownership of the land where these kids train. These kids want to win, but the gang's kids will do anything to stop them. If you are an adult, this movie probably won't appeal to you, but don't be surprised if your kids want to watch it over and over. It's just that kind of film.",1316822400,3,773,4.5285714285714285
2075625,5,B0002B15IS,"This product was delivered fast and came just as it was described.  It was in original wrapping and was in excellent condition.  It's a gift so I haven't viewed it yet, but because of the packaging I assume it will be in good condition as well. Thanks!",1289779200,,252,4.340425531914893
2075626,5,B0002B15IS,"We bought this movie for our 4 year old son and it was money well spent!  This movie is so adorable, made for kids, and has a storyline that children can understand.  It reminds me of the old after school specials that we watched as kids.  Our son watches this movie at least twice each evening and we find ourselves sitting down and watching it with him....again and again.  I would buy this as a gift and I would recommend it to anyone.",1254700800,,438,4.240963855421687
2075627,5,B0002B15IS,"My 4 year old grandson is obsessed with motorcycles and loves this movie.  He also likes ""Michael, Michael Motorcycle."" If you have a child who likes bikes and things that go fast, I recommend this movie.",1252972800,,204,4.666666666666667

8025700,4,B0002B15IS,"A cheesy old movie but the kids love it, especially the monkey! After we first watched it we had to watch it several times over the next week. I do like that there is a girl as the main rider at the beginning--inspiring for girls in general to know that they can ride too! Its nice though as well that the story centers on kids riding along with the monkey. The ""biker"" gang in it is ridiculously tacky and cheesy--sometimes you just have to laugh. There are fighting scenes and some name calling but no vulgar language.",1484784000,,520,4.371134020618556
