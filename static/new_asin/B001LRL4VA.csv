3691563,4,B001LRL4VA,I liked it.  This is the 3rd Jackie Mason Comedy  DVD I have purchased and my wife and we both thought all were extremely funny and well worth the money we aid for them!,1400889600,,169,3.9411764705882355
3691564,4,B001LRL4VA,"He's a very funny guy.  And even though some of the stuff I've heard on previsious CDs/DVDs, he's
still worth listening to.
It's money well spent.",1400371200,,146,4.615384615384615
3691565,5,B001LRL4VA,"If you enjoy the humor of Jackie Mason, you will enjoy this DVD. Jackie Mason is a very entertaining person. This DVD is simply great.",1384473600,2,134,4.4
3691566,4,B001LRL4VA,"Bought this to show at a ""movie night"" to a bunch of guys.

Jackie isn't the king of the one liners, but rather he tells a story to get laughs.

Not quite a fan of his politics, but  I am a fan of his humor.",1356652800,,207,3.5555555555555554
3691567,3,B001LRL4VA,"This is the third Jackie Mason DVD I bought. The material was good but not as good as some of his previous stuff. A lot of his old shtik is in this performance. I am not a prude but he dropped the ""F"" bomb a lot. I think people should know this in case they have children around. He never swore in the other DVDs I have. Still...I am not sorry I bought this.",1317340800,7,358,3.8513513513513513
3691568,5,B001LRL4VA,"He's INSIGHTFUL. Verbal delivery, like a Jazz musician, and of course, VERY FUNNY ! ! !  This DVD is a keeper. From the beginning to the end, it's a perfect stand-up comic 5 STAR DVD ! ! !",1311120000,5,188,3.9473684210526314
3691569,5,B001LRL4VA,You probably have guessed that I am not that young since I enjoy Jackie Mason. My husband and I laughed a lot with this video. You have to like him to enjoy his type comedy. My husband always likes him but I tend to cringe a little with some of his lines. I have to say that I haven't watched the video at all since the first time....who knows; I may have outgrown him.,1279584000,,369,4.0
3691570,5,B001LRL4VA,"One must be open minded to understand Jackie's jokes. His show on Broadway is a test of intelligence and of being a fine human being, completely genuine. We need public figures with a license to say everything about everybody. ""Is Obama black?""  ""If I have a pair of shoes, one is black and the other is white, do I have black shoes?"" ""Doesn't Obama look like a Jewish boy with a tan?"" Impossible to have the same audience for every joke.

Above all, I laughed from the bottom of my heart. This is the final goal of Jackie. To take away the tragic and make fun of the pretensions of many personalities who forgot who they really are and where they come from. Here is a speech of Governor Schwarzenegger: :""Blaah, Buah, Blah, beeh, California.. California beehbuah blah.... California""

He mixes many Yiddish terms and I would have appreciated a closed captioned version of the DVD. I rented it twice from Netflix and I will buy it. A classic...",1256515200,12,944,4.57396449704142
3691571,3,B001LRL4VA,"Jackie is the best in my time. I wish he would leave out the bad language, so I can recomend it to others. Maybe his people could BLEEP them?",1250726400,,141,3.896551724137931
8319827,5,B001LRL4VA,He is one of a kind in the world and needless to say it for those who know him and he is known by millions and all love him for his insight and his teaching (musar) but they are hidden through his jokes.,1467763200,,203,3.744186046511628
8319828,2,B001LRL4VA,Not up to my standards for Jackie Mason. May have been spoiled by seeing him person.,1455321600,,84,4.3125
8319829,5,B001LRL4VA,THERE IS NO ONE FUNNIER THAN THIS MAN. IT IS A ''MUST SEE''.,1445299200,,60,3.6923076923076925
