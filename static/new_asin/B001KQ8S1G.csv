This book has been more productive in our years of marriage than any counseling we've been through.  Prepare to be very honest with yourself and your assessments of yourself and your partner; the book is filled with interactive exercises and they are integral to the message of the entire book.  My partner and I were at a point of being very unhappy with our communicating (or lack of) but could not carve out much freedom in our schedules for regular counseling due to work and young children, and our fear that counseling would be a fruitless waste of time and money.  Yet we'd been in the past and believe in the value of marital therapy in any form; we knew we needed to do something to address our concerns.  This book was the ""hmm, maybe this will work"" last-ditch effort before we went to counseling.  Truly believe that if more people productively used literature such as this, the world would see fewer unhappy couples.  Buy this book, even if you read it on your own, it will help you.

Be prepared to deal with the harsh realities of your partnership.  An section I found intimidating is when some marital red flags are raised (Gottman refers to them as the Seven Horsemen)...acknowledging that any of those are present in a relationship is a difficult, but illuminating hurdle.

What we've taken away from it: figure out what the big issues are, (i.e. the Top Three) and work on those.  Once those issues have some dialogue & ideally resolution, all the 'little stuff' will feel more insignificant.  Believe me, at first I didn't even believe this; his advice in some situations is essentially to agree to disagree, and there doesn't even need to be much discussion about it (he points out the classic husband watches football while wife goes shopping as a healthy case of letting off steam instead of over-talking).  It really does work, IF you are able to:

-develop more self-awareness
-agree on the Top Three
-find productive dialogue/resolution for the Top Three (Gottman provides many tools for dialogue/resolution along the way)

Though at first we snickered a little at the ""ooh this is cheesy"" element of filling out questionnaires about each other, we found we really enjoyed the process and it did bring us closer while also allowing us to address some of the difficult aspects of our relationship.

Side note: highly recommend Dr. Gottman's work with young children.  I've come across his literature over the years as a parent of two and his advice is equally invaluable.  I find him to be a genial, caring author & researcher who is passionate about his work...this may come across to some that he has an inflated ego, but I think he really is just trying to help people form healthier, happier relationships.",1397001600,,2861,4.743434343434344

Great insight into the things that get in the way of having a truly happy marriage.  I want to take his live seminars now after buying this set!",1359676800,,252,4.340425531914893
8315801,4,B001KQ8S1G,Good introduction and summary of Gottman's findings and experiences in working with couples.  Lay public can definitely benefit from reading or watching the film.,1304726400,,162,5.75
