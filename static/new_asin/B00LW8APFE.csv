6508472,5,B00LW8APFE,Had already seen the series on PBS; enjoyed it a lot; she's an excellent actress who played a not quite perfect woman/wife/mother/detective and I don't mind the English subtitles; really good music too.,1429228800,4,202,5.151515151515151

6508474,3,B00LW8APFE,Not bad but not great either - actress needs to tone it down a bit,1413072000,5,66,3.466666666666667
8668473,4,B00LW8APFE,"Quite enjoyed it - finished the series this morning.  BUT, where is series 2?  There is at least a second (imdb notes it) but not on (so far) MHZ nor is it available on Amazon.",1521849600,,176,4.0
8668474,5,B00LW8APFE,"I probably had watched it even without subtitles though don't speak Italian.  Realistic, funny and tense.  And most characters are lovable with all their flaws.  Great Italian entertainment, worth the time.",1508371200,,206,5.580645161290323
8668475,3,B00LW8APFE,"I thought the acting itself wasn't so great....the major unfoldings in the plot a little too convenient....and her magical deductions came  without much in put that would logically bring them

Some of the children are better than the older actors...

BUT it was entertaining...",1489881600,,277,5.25

8668477,4,B00LW8APFE,"Diverting, interesting and some insights into Italian culture, at least as seen on TV.",1457308800,,86,5.214285714285714
8668478,5,B00LW8APFE,"I enjoyed this mini-series. The lead actress was wonderful. There are two essential story-lines revolving around her: Her family crisis and her daily life as an Inspector. She and her team solve crimes every episode and then there is the ongoing family saga. I was captivated by it all and kept wondering how it would end, which kept me watching. As well, there is a lot of warmth and emotion in the character interactions. As I'm an American, it was fun to watch an Italian series.",1456617600,3,482,4.616279069767442

8668480,2,B00LW8APFE,"This attractive, but disappointing Italian cop show feature a chesty and good-looking redhead Detective Lisa Milani who lives just outside of Rome but is in charge of an investigative squad in the Eternal City. Each 130 to 150 minute episode  centers on a unique crime which is solved in that episode but her physician husband is charged with a crime in episode one and she works on clearing him throughout all six episodes. Guess the outcome of that? in addition, they has three children who she dotes on, as much as she can; making sure that she is home to cook supper. In short, she is an Italian version of the modern, can-do-it-all, have-it-all, super woman, while he, the husband, comes off as a wimpy drama queen. And, it typical TV fashion, NONE of the kids look remotely like either parent, hmmmmm. Her investigative team is consists of a tall, young hunk who drools over Lisa, a tubby lothario/comic relief, an angry, ambitious, young female detective with lots of attitude and a hard luck background and a man-eating, almost impossibly good looking female prosecuting attorney who is also Lisa's best friend. With the exception of the tubby lothario and her kids, everyone else looks like they were all escapees from a daytime soap opera...or a USA Network series. Filmed in a bright color palate, it is lovely to look at and the director makes excellent use of the Rome locations. There are travelogues that aren't this attractive. Still, at its core, it is a mish-mash of police procedural, family drama, soap opera while failing to succeed at any one. It is alternatively sappy and clichd. There are three topless scenes featuring the seriously good looking star, Lucrezia Lante Della Rovere, and on superfluous love making scene; included, I suppose to show that Lisa and her husband really do love each other. There is only on f-word in the whole series, and that from a woman who has to be in her 70's! With those exceptions, it would be suitable for young children and up...but why? Surprisingly, this went to a second series. Easy to skip. IF you want beautiful Italian scenery, Montalbano and Brunetti are much better.",1445472000,,2138,4.825613079019074
8668481,4,B00LW8APFE,"Fast paced, sophisticated story lines, Lead actress ""Donna"" really shines and holds all together - very enjoyable.",1444176000,,114,5.764705882352941
8668482,3,B00LW8APFE,"Mystery is good, but too soap opera-ish.",1438732800,,40,4.857142857142857
