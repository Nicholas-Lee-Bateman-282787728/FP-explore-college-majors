2670307,3,B000JD6M1Y,"Bradley Smith's review is dead on.  Most of the elements of this film are competent and engaging, but there's nothing really deep here. Standing Still provided a good hour or two of escape. I've seen several of these ""just before the wedding"" ensemble movies, and this one holds its own.",1263340800,,287,4.74
2670308,3,B000JD6M1Y,"Coming of age flick involving some 25 year olds who discover that getting married ain't so bad after all. The usual deadbeat dad makes an appearance, someone's pregnant, someone's a lesbian, someone is a jerk, and, oh yeah, there's plenty of gratuitous naked flesh. Does the plot make sense? Yes, such as it is. I have no idea what the title means, though. Worth watching, but not urgently.",1214092800,,390,4.75
2670309,3,B000JD6M1Y,"The story takes place during a 48 hour time period prior to a wedding. If it wasn't for the profanity (the ""F"" word being used 42 times), nudity, drugs, drunk scenes and underage sex I would have thought I was watching one of the less entertaining episodes of Friends.",1194393600,,268,4.489795918367347
2670310,3,B000JD6M1Y,"This movie is essentially the story of marraige of a couple the day before their marraige with the arrival of old college friend and the ensuing bachelor/bachelorette parties and the wedding. Included in the story as always is some distress/secret in the bride and groom past, now confronting them.  Some of the friend had broken relationships now brought back together with their mutual friend put in an awkward position.  Also, thier is the best man confronted with his own future and questioning his own marriage plans to his long time girlfriend.  No suprises here, many of the wedding party end up ""hooking up"" during the course of the evenings party, and no major suprises with any of it.  Trying to be Sixteen candles meets American Wedding...maybe a touch of breakfast club/pretty in pink, just not great as a knock off. check it out, I think many may like this one, but just not my cup of tea.",1182297600,3,902,4.726114649681529
2670311,2,B000JD6M1Y,"This movie is definitely aimed at the 20-something crowd.  I didn't much care about anybody in the movie, but it was great to see Amy Adams do her thing before she hit the big-time.  Her lesbian kiss/tummy snuggle is easily the highlight of the movie!",1176854400,,251,4.555555555555555
8150016,4,B000JD6M1Y,Enticing. Was skeptical at first because this type of genre isn't my normal one to partake in. After I got about 2 chapters in I just had to know what happened!!,1491868800,,161,4.225806451612903

8150020,4,B000JD6M1Y,"I don't recall too many intricate details about this movie, however I do remember that I liked it a lot. I'll be watching it again, so that says a lot.",1435622400,,151,4.066666666666666

8150022,2,B000JD6M1Y,I love Amy Adams so I watched this movie just because I had some time. It was OK but nothing very special.,1394150400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8150023,4,B000JD6M1Y,I got this movie in a orderly fashion and it was not as funny as I thought it would be. To make up for that it had depth to it.,1381968000,,127,3.2666666666666666

and I thought Adam Garcia was super cute! no complaints..",1374019200,,137,4.3076923076923075
8150025,5,B000JD6M1Y,"Let's face it!  Kids will be kids and there's value in coming together when your friends get married to celebrate the ""night before"".  The typical flick would make this a total joke...a night of stupidity, drunkeness, drugs and mindless sh&^!  This one allows tha cast to be as carefree as they want on the eve of the marriage, but it has a profound message...many messages...and takes responsibility and pride in the sanction of marriage, friendship, family and lifestyle.  I loved this film.  It captures youth, marriage, commitment, zany antics and reality in a neat little 90-minute bundle.  Ya' gotta see this with your significant other, wife, husband, family...anyone.  All 5 stars.",1299542400,,689,5.153153153153153
