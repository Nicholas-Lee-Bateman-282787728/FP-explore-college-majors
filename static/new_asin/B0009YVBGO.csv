2342655,5,B0009YVBGO,"MOST movies don't move me but on June 23,2005 I saw 'Walk on Water' with my friend, the German Ambassador to Singapore, Andreas Michaelis. It was to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of Israel and Germany's establishment of diplomatic relations.

I love this movie and Lior Ashkenazi's acting as Eyal the top Mossad assassin is simply outstanding. The story is simple. As the world knows (it is an open secret after all) Mossad selectively terminates the enemies of Israel, and the movie starts with a HAMAS terrorist leader terminated in front of his wife and son of about 7 years old. A chillingly professional potrayal where not one word is spoken in its cold blooded efficiency as the hero injects the Arab with lethal poison in Istanbul.

Eyal returns to find his wife dead of a drug overdose. Suicide...but no tears as he is 'knallharte'(brutal in German) and kalt (cold). His boss wants him to see the Mossad psychologist but he refuses with a classic line, ""She saw one and had therapy for years and see what happens!"" Eyal is so cold and seemingly unaffected by his wifes' suicide, he can even get all his 9mm pistol shots into his shooting qualification target in an area the size of a playing card (excellent group). There is a lot of ""schwarz Humor"" or black humour in this film. To try to calm him down, his boss assigns him to befriend a young German gentleman who has a sister in a Kibbutz in Israel. Why? The sickly Grandpa is a Nazi War Criminal who murdered most of the inhabitants of a whole region of Germany, including all the family of Eyal's boss, and all Eyal's family except for his mother.

Eyal feels the old Nazi hiding out in Argentina should be left to die as he is very sickly. ""NO! We must get him before God does. That is Justice!"" is the adamant sentiment of his boss. It is a personal Vendetta for him. Spymasters are human too. So off goes Eyal to befriend the German with his cover as a Tour Guide. At the Kibbutz, it doesn't take him long to 'bug' the German girl's apartment while brother and sister are learning an intricate Israeli folk dance.

As the investigation progresses the two men go swimming in the Sea of Galilee and the German tries to 'walk on water' with hilarious results. The two men form a good rapport very quickly,  but later in a Tel Aviv nightclub, Eyal realises with shock and horror that the German man is a poofter (homosexual or 'schwul' in German). His sister tell the Mossad officer with a laugh that he even flaunts his homosexuality openly in Germany to annoy their parents. Eyal says with a deadpan expression, ""Your brother is really friendly."" It made me laugh a lot! The facial expression on Eyal's face when he realises his new German friend is 'schwul' is really well acted and very amusing. The German poofter's new boyfriend is the Arab bartender of the posh restaurant they dine in before going to the nightclub.

Just when it seems to be a wild goose chase, the audio surveillance which Eyal records on a CD with his laptop reveals that the German girl knows that their Grandpa is alive, and that their parent's have been maintaining him in South America all these years. Her discovery of their deceit in telling her that he was dead led her to go to Israel to live in the Kibbutz as a backlash. The Poofter returns to Berlin. The Mossad officer is ordered to follow.  Eyal flies to Berlin, contacts the poof , eats that classic German street food of 'curry Wurst', and beats up a gang of Neo-Nazi skinheads with his 'Krav Maga' (self defence) skills to rescue the poof in a U-Bahn station. Eyal is one helluva guy and I say that without any irony. It all comes to a head at the 70th birthday party for the German poofs' father who is very wealthy.

Finally, the old Nazi with one foot in the grave appears in a wheelchair for his son's grand birthday bash in the big country mansion. Later, the Nazi dies, but who actually kills him?? I can't tell all, as it would spoil the suprise for you before you watch the movie. Just trust me when I tell you it has a very happy ending that involves an extremely adorable and cute baby. The acting is superb, the scenery is fabulous, the story is relevant to our troubled times. I really recommend you watch this movie. There are many lessons to be learnt from this movie, tolerance for one, forgiveness for another. The joyful ending brought tears to my eyes and it will touch you too, unless you are a stone cold Mossad assassin...but even assassins have feelings.

2342656,4,B0009YVBGO,"I had never heard of this film while searching for an interesting film to see to kill 2 hours. When I noticed the advertisement poster saying: ""He has been trained to kill, until he learned about his enemy"", was what initially sold me on purchasing the tickets.

I was most intrigued by the main character Eyal(Ashkenazi), the Mossad assasin. He possessed a quiet, tough exterior with a humorous personality at times, struggling with his own mission of hunting down a former Nazi to bring closure to a job that eventually drives his own wife to commit suicide.

While watching the two main characters, Eyal and Axel, the film presented a constrasting yet enlightening view between a hetero-sexual(Eyal) and gay men and how both viewed the world as a Jew and a German, while dealing with their past demons.

For the most part, Walk on Water raises interesting questions about cultural & historical grudges as seen through the eyes of Eyal and everyone he comes in contact with. Dramatically different, Walk on Water had me on the edge to find out how Eyal planned on completing his mission. A must see!!",1117584000,9,1102,4.7894736842105265
2342657,5,B0009YVBGO,"First of all, let me state that I have not yet seen this film. The rating above is based on reviews and research on the film.  I have long looked forward to seeing it and plan, at long last, to do so today.  The single reviewer of the film appartently stated that ""It is doubtful I will ever visit Germany as a tourist.""  Presumably, this means after having viewed this film?  This equates to one saying I will never visit Japan because of Pearl Harbor or England because of the American Revolution.  More appropriately, it is like me saying I will never visit Russia or Poland because of the murders, mass rapes and other wanton crimes that took places during the flight and explusion of the German population from Eastern Germany (Silesia,East Prussia etc.) in l945-l947.  Never visiting Germany again because of events prior and during WWII to me seems like a clear case of chastising the sons for the crimes of the fathers.  I look forward to viewing the film today and will enter the theatre with a completely open mind.",1117238400,3,1025,4.5989010989010985

2342684,4,B0009YVBGO,"This is an excellent movie. Especially if you are interested in the history of Nazi-Jewish relationships in modern times. An assassin that is assigned a job to murder an old Nazi. He is a very bigoted man. He is an Israeli and hates Germans and Gays. Thru the course of this movie he softens his attitude, once he gets to know Germans and Gays personally. He sees that the old prejudices are not valid in modern times.. He ends up having a complete change of heart. A must see movie if you especially enjoy history. Note: If you hate someone because of their race, sexual orientation, religion or anything else......Just spent 30 days with them and get to understand them. You will have a dramatic change of heart.

2342699,5,B0009YVBGO,"I had no idea what to expect, but I am glad I watched.

Spoiler Alert- I thought the moment when the Israeli agent was confronted with being expected to commit murder was glossed over in an effort to justify his decision being based on his experience with his wife. It was an odd choice and the obvious juxtaposition of the expectations of his boss being the equivalent to the past crimes of their target was a very unfortunately missed opportunity. As well, the agent should have had more of an internal conflict between justice, which was his goal, and committing murder as punishment for actions of seventy years ago. [As opposed to an agent killing to save live in the present.] One would expect him to have verbalized that conflict in his boss's hotel room, and because it wasn't, what should have been a strong tension building scene was very weak. Still gave it five stars though, -it's an ambitious and creative story with a believable level of complexity within the characters, plus a good twist at the climax.",1496016000,3,1019,4.692737430167598
2342700,5,B0009YVBGO,Wonderfully acted and well told story.  You connect with the characters right away and the story flows from there.  The story line is very touching and believable.  I am surprised I haven't seen this movie sooner.  I might have to buy to own this movie...,1495843200,,255,4.6
2342701,5,B0009YVBGO,"This was a movie I wasn't expecting to like as much as I did.  I thought the script and acting were superb.

From the description, you get the gist of where this film is going, so I won't go in to all the ins and outs of the plot, but it was a very good movie about about unexpected acceptance, tolerance, and betrayal.

I thought the writer did a good developing the relationship between Eyal and Axel...even though I made the mistake of reading about the movie on Wiki so I knew what was going to happen, the writer really lead you to believe there was more underlying sexual chemistry than there really was.  I really thought Eyal was going to turn out to be gay (and I already knew the ending!  lol).

I've never heard of Lior Ashkenazi before this movie, but I now would like to see him in other films.

I gave this 5 stars because it drew me in right from the beginning.",1495670400,,876,4.209580838323354

I saw the assassin's  change of heart not as a  conversion  but ending a chapter of  his life that had worn  him down  and destroyed  his relationships.

2342707,5,B0009YVBGO,A poignant emotional and intellectual illustration about becoming just as evil to accomplish eradicating it thus this original story ends up a rock solid tale of redemption. What a great production that takes its time to develop and explore several difficult and deeply disturbing family issues stemming from a past the kids only heard about then were suddenly living in real time and its different effect on them. This story also incorporates homosexuality and provided one of the best honest most human insights into it. Understanding truly is knowledge and wisdom.

SUBTITLES! I love foreign films, but I know many do not like to read, so I like to put that first. If you can get past this, which I think you should, watch this movie. Straight agent for the Mossad (or whatever Israeli's call their version of the CIA) is charged with figuring out what is going on with the great grandchildren of a famous Nazi war criminal that disappeared. This movie has gay elements that are not for everyone and some nudity. I just think this movie could be watched by straight, gay, and every other type of person in this world.

2342747,3,B0009YVBGO,"To its credit, the movie 'dares' to touch on issues which are tough to deal with. As such, many (especially outside of Israel) are indeed very reluctant to confront them 'yet again'. Moreover, the film puts on its agenda not only the moral issue related to the way Nazi criminals (and their complicit supporters) have been dealt with, but also other forms of bigotry - against gay people and (if much more indirectly) the moral dilemmas facing  Israel's control over the Palestinians.
You don't have to agree with the direction this movie offers in dealing with those dilemmas, and my critique is not about it. However, I felt that the transformation of the Mossad agent into a peaceful non violent person, as it revolved around his dealing with the Nazi criminal, - lacked credibility. It would have felt much more credible if any of the other themes were the trigger to his transformation. At least among Israelis, the  prevalent approach is very far from 'move on and away from the pursuit of justice to the genocidal Nazi criminals'. For this reason, the metaphorical 'cleansed'
ending felt more like a fantasy than a hopeful suggestion.",1486425600,2,1141,4.876288659793815

For the 2nd mission, a loaded hyperdermic is at hand. He believes he can keep it all together.  He never cries, he almost boasts, attributing it to a malfunction of his tear ducts, as he applies a few eye drops. Assigned to capture one surviving Nazi official, he engages with Pia (Caroline Peters) and Axel (Knut Berger), the adult grandchildren of his target. In response to them, his humanity emerges. Among his shifting perspectives and emotionality is his view of homosexuality, through knowing Axel, and Pia starts to become a focus of his personal interest. An ultimate adjustment is about to occur.  You'll see.  In the midst of the serious stuff, some clever and amusing scenes include some sibling karaoke and Axel's teaching a group of still likely partisan Nazi descendants a dance, which they happily join in. He omits its origin and its name-- the hora, of course. The ending is a surprising stunner. The acting is solid. Recommend.",1485043200,3,1077,4.939226519337017

2342879,5,B0009YVBGO,"Very well done  in every sense of the words.  Writing, directing, cinematography, acting.  The film is in Hebrew, German and English with subtitles for the languages of German and Hebrew.  This is an outstanding film about a personal vendetta of the past.  A Nazi War Criminal who has escaped the law all these years is thought to be alive by the father of a Mossad operative.  The father wants his son to befriend the grandchildren of this man and learn the grandfather's whereabouts. The son has just gone through a trauma of his own in the present day.  he is not keen on this quest his father has in mind.  Yet, he does befriend the grandchildren (who are adults themselves) and does locate the very old Nazi War Criminal.  How it proceeds is thought provoking and inspiring.  There is nudity in this film (male frontal nudity) but no sexual acts.  It is a film of depth simply presented about how two generations after the horrors of WWII Nazi Germany and the annihilation of so many Jews (and others) the children and grandchildren come to grips with the horror of Evil and what Evil has done.  The reversal of roles of the two main characters--the Jewish Mossad son and the German gay grandson reminded me of the movie KISS OF THE SIDER WOMAN in respect to what is manliness when it comes to stepping up to do the right thing.  It is an interesting movie that stays with you for a long time.",1484006400,5,1398,4.5

I know this may sound weird to most but I was actually rooting for the two male leads finding happiness together. I just found them more suitable for each other then Pia and Eyal. Plus Pia was, I felt like, to much of a back ground character for anything else to really blossom. Maybe I feel that way due to my over zealous need for Axel and Eyal to end up together because there just isn't enough LGBT movies out there that are worth 5 stars and still have a happy ending. However, This was an amazing film that had my emotions warring against each other the whole time and is worth watching a hundred times over.

2342933,5,B0009YVBGO,"This is one movie that really must be viewed and judged on an individual and very personal level. I vacillated between anger, sympathy, compassion, disgust, and hope. The rollercoaster ride of vengeance will end for real finally in the not too distant future. Jewish survivors and German Survivors of WWII will be dead and a page in history can be given rest. Lessons will be learned but no longer torture the soul.
I suggest viewing this movie with an open mind and watching it to the end. I doubt anyone could criticize any of the production aspects. It is the subject matter that is difficult. This is the material of fact, the emotions of our grandparents, and great grandparents.
I was determined to give this move a #! until the very end. Obviously, I changed my mind and gave it a #5. I almost stopped watching. I am happy I did not. There is hope even in the darkest corners of our hearts.",1482796800,8,897,4.50920245398773

Lior Ashkenazi is especially sharp as the Mossad agent assigned to exact retribution, with dark, rugged, chiseled features -- shades of Daniel Craig.

That said, however, this film is a gem and if you are even flirting with it here, then don't hesitate to buy or rent it. When I got it I had no idea what to expect, just took a gamble. I admire the efficient counterterrorism of the Mossad, so that was a draw. Always like a nice fast spy thriller, and this film does have a fun dose of that. I also have a lifelong interest in how relatively normal German familes manage to deal with elders who were something worse than mere conformists during WW2 (I've known such families), and I gathered that was a theme too. But, neither my husband nor I like things that veer toward politically correct handling of those subjects, and that doubt kept me from buying the DVD. Rented it instead. When it was over, however, both my husband and I wished we had made the other choice. Never dull to watch, sometimes agreeably ""kinetic,"" other times a profound character study, and often extremely beautiful, the story sucked us in from the opening scene and left us both delighted and deeply moved, a rare combination.

In this beautifully directed film, an Israeli assassin seeks to kill a Nazi war criminal and in the process begins a friendship with the grandson of the man he intends to bring to justice. The grandson, open-minded and gay, is unaware of his family's involvement in the German policy of genocide and has come to Israel to visit his sister who lives on a Kibutz and wants to avoid all contact with her nations's past. Irony can be seen in the fact that he is gay and, although German, would have been treated in the manner of the Jews during World War II. More ironies can be seen when he establishes a relationship with a gay Palestinian under the hateful eyes of the Massad assassin. Using action and finely honed dialogue,

However, I guess the key theme was human heart, and the makers wanted to hit that point as soon as possible without delay. They did it well.
The movie was kind of a small budget production, not too many characters; the script was of typical Hebrew movies--lot of directness, often tactless personal communication, yet splashes of dry humor here and there.

2343044,4,B0009YVBGO,"This is a film from Eytan Fox (`The Bubble' and `Yossi and Jagger') as ever there is a gay theme but loads more besides. It is about Eyal who is a Mossad agent and a bit of a hit man. After his wife commits suicide, his boss decides he needs a less stressful assignment. So he gets him to pose as a tourist guide for one Axel Himmelman.

Axel is visiting his big sister at her Kibbutz; she has hired the tour guide for her brother who has flown in from Berlin to do a bit of sight seeing and ostensibly to get her to attend her father's birthday in Germany. The skeleton in the family cupboard is that Grandpa Himmelman was a great big Nazi, and Mossad think he is not only still alive but will attend the knees up.

Whilst Eyal tours around with Axel it is clear they have some sort of bond, but what is not clear is that Axel is gay. As secrets are revealed and truths are found out the whole thing takes on a life of its own, with surprising consequences for all involved.

I really enjoyed this film, some may think it a bit contrived in the way some of the plot plays out, but it is an original story acted and directed very well and more than entertaining. In Hebrew, German and a surprising amount of English with very good sub titles.

Many undercurrents spoken or assumed or hidden.  The assassination no more than a useless token on a war criminal who was allowed to live his life to the full. As the daughter alludes- connections made these people untouchable and supported. There were enough Nazis working in the judicial system after the war to pass the laws that KEPT themselves protected despite any and all cultural atonement.

2343049,5,B0009YVBGO,"I own this dvd and what a joy it is to watch...........and re-watch.  It complies with all of my requirements for a top notch film: solid script; excellent acting; good directing, editing out of all unnecessary fluff; and a good soundtrack to enhance the film - end result?  This film does all of the above.  The tranformation which the lead character Eyal (played by Lior Ashkenazy) undergoes, is a beautiful character study in itself.  He started (in the film) as a cold-hearted Israeli killer of terrorists, and ended up a real human being - in touch with his feelings/emotions.

The story revolves around his important assignment to get close to the adult grand children of a once thought-to-be-dead German Nazi.  Pia (the grand-daughter) permanently lives on a kibbutz in Israel, having abandoned her well-to-do German parents.  Her younger brother Axel is on an assignment of his own en route to Israel: to try and convince Pia to reconcile with their parents or to at least come home for the celebration of their father's next big birthday celebration.

Eyal is assigned to befriend both Pia & especially Axel, and so he poses as a tour guide for the visiting Axel.  Eyal succeeds in planting a listening device in Pia's living quarters while he sneaked away from them on the first evening.

Axel makes no secret about his sexual orientation and director Fox makes this viewer wonder if Eyal isn't more than the usual interested in an exploration of other lifestyles himself, due to several clues in the film, one of which is the conversation about circumcision he and Axel has on the beach while showering.  However, Eyal was markedly uncomfortable once inside the gay club where Axel took the three of them one evening.

The title of this film is given relevance early on in the film when Eyal takes his guest to Galilee and Axel makes an unsuccessful attempt to walk on water, but afterwards instructs Eyal on the essential requirement of purity of heart to succeed in this feat.

Initially Eyal listens to all the communication between brother & sister via his installed listening device and records it for Menachem, his boss.  Eyal soon loses interest in this project, but still hands over the recordings to his boss without listening to them.  Axel returns to Germany without convincing his sister of the importance of her presence at their father's celebration, but she in turn had informed her brother of the real reasons for her animosity towards their parents: their grandfather - who is alive and was hiding in Argentina all these years.  Eyal did not listen to this revelation in the taped recordings, but Menachem did and instructs him to follow Axel to Germany.

The two men reconnect in Germany, and Axel invites Eyal to share the family celebration with him.  Many things happen the night of the birthday party, amongst other things, the change of Eyal's heart - and Axel's.  The movie fast forwards 2 years, and ends with an email from Eyal to Axel, which brings the film's title also right up front again.  I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough - it's plain very well done.  If you like watching movies a 2nd and more times, then go ahead and add this one to your collection.",1331510400,3,3208,4.796363636363636
2343050,5,B0009YVBGO,"The Eytan Fox film `Walk on Water` is an ambitious little film.  A little over an hour and half long, it tackles a monster of a topic: the barriers that separate us from one another.  The film examines this within a series of smaller dichotomies ranging from the global to the personal.  The Arab/Israeli, gay/straight, German/Jew divides are all touched on here as are the divisions between generations and even siblings.  Such an overweening design is bound to fall short and `Walk on Water, is no exception, yet not through lack of trying.

An Israeli hit man, Eyal (sexy Israeli actor Lior Askenazi) is a journeyman in the trade of political assassinations, knocking off Hamas targets without the blink of an eye.  After a successful hit, Eyal returns to Israel and to personal tragedy.  He finds his wife dead, a suicide note nearby. Stunned and overwhelmed (the note blames him), Eyal escapes into his work, begging for a new assignment to distract his turmoil.

His new task is to find the whereabouts of an escaped Nazi.  Posing as a tour guide, Eyal befriends the war criminal`s grandchildren, one of whom, Pia (Caroline Berger) has found a new life in Israel, working on a kibbutz.  Her brother, Axel (Knut Berger) is visiting her in hopes of luring her back to Germany for their father`s birthday.

Eyal spins an exasperating web to gain access into the grandchildren`s lives.  He bugs their apartment and uses sly inquiries to learn more about their ghostly grandfather.  Eyal and Axel`s relationship soon evolves into a friendship of sorts.  Much to his professional annoyance, Eyal yearns to share his grief and guilt with somebody and Axel proves to be just the compassionate listener Eyal needs.  Yet, his macho walls prevent him from opening up.  Axel, on the other hand, isn`t sure how to`come out` to his straight friend.

The growing relationship between Eyal and Axel results in some great scenes.  For example, when Eyal takes Axel to the Dead Sea for a camp out, he suspects nothing of Axel`s orientation and is flabbergasted at Axel`s encyclopedic knowledge of the male sex organ.

When Eyal follows Axel back to Germany, things speed up.  Despite some funny asides, for example when Eyal inquires about how `things work` between two men, the plot intensifies as Eyal closes in on the illusive grandfather.  Axel soon learns what Eyal is doing in Germany while he himself becomes privy to an awful family secret.  The film`s dramatic apex is reached when both Eyal and Axel act upon the family secret each in profoundly different ways.  Both men are faced with a life-altering choice.

`Walk on Water` jumps from vignette to vignette, each conveying an important message or irony.  In fact, the film is rife in irony, both historical and cultural and requires repeated viewings to catch them all.  Moreover, the characters are more complex than they appear.  For me, Axel was the more complex and troubling of the two male leads.  On the one hand, he questions Eyal`s gruff denouncing of Palestinian suicide bombers saying, `they have mothers and children too.`  Yet, when Eyal dispatches homophobic thugs in Berlin, Axel expresses a very different attitude.  `You should have shot them.  They pollute the world.`  Obviously, Eytan Fox is playing around with the hypocrisy of many of Israel`s critics, but such troubling complexity in the characters sharpens the film`s realistic edge.

Eyal is also a man of layers.  Askenazi plays him with incredible subtlety.  While Eyal`s detachment from his murderous work failed to convince me at times, Askenazi does manage to show the minute cracks in Eyal`s persona.  Eyal`s increasing aggressiveness hides an emotional storm inside .  His final transformation comes off a bit understated, but believable considering he was unable to mourn his wife`s death.

The film`s other asset is its evocation of place.  The differences between Mediterranean Israel and Northern Europe are brought to life in grand style.  Israel comes to life as a mixture of light and water with great shots of both the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea.  Moreover, few films have captured the brooding heaviness of Germany like this one does.  Axel and Pia`s parental home in Wannsee (another allusion here) with its stately furniture and darkly oppressive interior mirrors the shadowy secrets of Axel and Pia`s family.  When the long-awaited prey of Eyal`s hunting mission makes his entrance through the blackened house, the effect is unnerving to say the least.

`Walk on Water` closes with a message of rebirth and renewal.  Axel, Pia and Eyal all seem intent on closing past chapters and moving towards happiness and peace.  While its ending might appear too easy for some, nevertheless, `Walk on Water` leaves one with the feeling that the impossible is indeed achievable.",1324512000,4,4817,4.994974874371859
2343051,5,B0009YVBGO,"Walk on water is a movie with many virtues.  One of the most interesting is the way a young gay male named Axel is portrayed.  Rather than conforming to effeminate stereotypes or relying on a super-butch departure from conventional characters and caricatures, Axel, who figures conspicuously throughout Walk on Water, is just a guy.  Moreover, in some ways he is more comfortable with violence against thugs and war criminals than his Israeli Mossad friend, Eyal.  The gay guy is the one who wants to kill marauding skinheads who attack him and Eyal in the subway, while the Mossad agent is content with using his martial arts skills and not pulling his gun.  The gay guy is the one who, without hesitation, turns off the oxygen that is keeping his Nazi war criminal grandfather alive, saving the Mossad agent the mess of having to use poison in a syringe to kill the frail old Nazi butcher.

When the Mossad agent is troubled, he seeks out the good counsel of his new-found gay friend, and there is never the slightest intimation that this is due to homosexual yearnings harbored but hidden by the Mossad agent.  When they swim naked in the buoyant waters of a super-salty sea, they're just a couple of guys having a good time.  Again, sex has nothing to do with it.

The gay character neither hides nor advertises his homosexuality.  He's comfortable with it, accepts himself as he is, and makes it easy for others to do the same.

Walk on Water is not a film that slyly promotes homosexuality or paints any national, religious, or ethnic group as collectively fostering a gay orientation.  It's just a movie that has a gay character who happens to be intelligent, easy going, capable of being angry and violent given suitable provocation, and who makes his way in the world much like anyone else.  He's just a guy, and it's a tribute to the screenwriter, director, and the actor that they pulled this off so well.

Walk on Water is a first-rate movie filled with intrigue and suspense that happens to have a likeable but sexually unobtrusive gay guy as one of its characters.  His gayness is entirely secondary to a search and destroy operation against Nazi war criminals, beating death from natural causes to the punch.",1324080000,2,2223,4.72279792746114
2343052,3,B0009YVBGO,"I generally love Israeli movies in Hebrew with English subtitles and I wanted to like this movie. But the storyline and development are full of holes. Too many things unclear or hard to accept. For example, the hero's wife commits suicide while he is on a mission. He comes home to discover her body. This is a major key to the story but is completely unmotivated; there is no explanation why she would suddenly do this except for two cryptic words in a suicide note. Eyal's reaction to this major trauma is minimal and wooden and he remains wooden throughout the film. So when towards the end he breaks down in tears, it seems completely out of character and fake; I wanted to laugh. Likewise the German boy; without giving away any spoilers, he does something towards the end which is surprising but the emotional preparation for it (his and ours as viewers) is completely insufficient. Again, seems hard to believe.

The problem is the director, Eytan Fox. He is good on the lightweight stuff - the reaction of a tough Israeli guy to the gay life, and his flirtation with the German girl Pia. (All his movies have homosexual love affairs.) But for this film, which deals with weightier issues, he is out of his depth - skills of direction not big enough to match the script.",1320278400,,1277,4.600877192982456

2343054,5,B0009YVBGO,"A terrific film from Israeli director Eytan Fox.  Lior Ashkenazi plays Eyal, a ruthless Israeli assassin whose wife commits suicide because she cannot live with his profession.  His boss judges that Eyal cannot return to active duty, so assigns him to track down an elderly Nazi by attaching himself to the old man's grandchildren, Axel and Pia).  Pia has fled Germany and now lives on a kibbutz in Israel.  Axel is a staunch liberal who is visiting his sister.  Eyal is disgusted with his assignment and the grandchildren, but eventually is drawn to them.  Due to their influence, he comes to recognize the inhumanity of his profession, which has cost him his wife's love and life.

Lior is superb as the cold-hearted assassin.  Knut Berger and Caroline Evans give fine performance as Axel and Pia, as does Gideon Shemer as Eyal's boss.

This film is marketed as a gay-themed movie, due to the fact that Axel is gay.  His sexual orientation is not central to the plot, but only serves to emphasize Eyal's humanization, as he overcomes his homophobia to befriend the young man.

At once chilling and incredibly moving, this is a beautiful film.",1310256000,,1144,4.815384615384615
2343055,5,B0009YVBGO,"Walk on Water is an outstanding film; indeed, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting is first rate; the script is full of great dialogue; and the choreography along with the cinematography couldn't have been better. The plot flows along at a very good pace; never once was I bored! The story becomes quite emotional at the very end of the film and I actually cried a few tears which is something I almost never do. In addition, the casting was perfectly done.

When the film starts, we meet Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi), a hit man/agent for Mossad, the Israeli Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations. He's an accomplished hit man who can easily take out a dangerous terrorist as we see in the first few minutes of the picture; and Eyal is quite hardened by the wrongs that have happened to the Jews in the past, especially during World War Two in Nazi Germany. Eyal's boss at Mossad now has a new assignment for him--to track down a notorious Nazi who has been in hiding in Argentina since the end of World War Two. Eyal's boss tells Eyal to pose as an Israeli tour guide for Axel (Knut Berger) the grandson of the Nazi; Axel is coming to Israel to visit his sister Pia (Caroline Peters) who now lives on an Israeli kibbutz and learns Hebrew. Eyal must find out the whereabouts of the Nazi by spying on Axel and Pia; he bugs Pia's room on the kibbutz and he takes Axel around posing as a tour guide even though Eyal has little true interest in this matter.

But things don't go as Eyal planned. Eyal's wife, Iris (Natali Shilman), kills herself and Eyal soon discovers that Axel is a friendly, sweet, peace loving liberal who is genuinely horrified about what the Nazis did during World War Two. Moreover, Axel turns out to be gay; and when Axel and his sister Pia are enjoying themselves in a gay bar the very macho, heterosexual Eyal withdraws because it's getting too much for him--these Germans are not exactly the bad guys he expected them to be; and when Axel expresses his sympathy for Palestinians and even sleeps with an Arab (Rafik, played so well by Yousef 'Joe' Sweid), Eyal is truly thrown for a loop.

It may seem as if I've given too much away; but in many respects I have merely scraped the surface of the plot. Suffice it to say that Eyal's boss eventually insists that Eyal ""finish the job"" by going to Germany (a place Eyal never wanted to be), try to find Axel and Pia's notoriously evil Nazi grandfather who might or might not be there--and then ""eliminate"" him.

Can Eyal do this? Will the grandfather be there in Germany even though intelligence indicates that he has been hiding in Argentina for decades? What happens between Eyal and Axel in Berlin when tensions mount at the birthday party for Axel and Pia's father? No plot spoilers here--watch and find out! Be prepared for a few quick plot twists and an ending that you won't forget anytime soon.

Walk on Water is a superlative film about working things out between Germans and Jews, straights and gays; all the while contrasting right versus wrong and good versus evil.

Therefore, it is possible that this film has special personal meaning for me.

For religious families, there are aspects of the content which you may / or probably would consider to be inappropriate for non-adults.
I would allow my children to watch this, but I am probably in a minority.
For me, the ""objectionable content"" is mild in comparison to so many movies out there.  My opinion, others may disagree.

Parents should therefore watch first alone, and then decide suitability.

For me the content is so powerful and so important, it deserves to be viewed, even by teenagers and young adults.

It lures the viewer with the promise of an Israeli-made movie about a self-doubting Mossad agent tasked with finding an aged Nazi.  Quirks in the scripting and direction, however, quickly become apparent.  The audience is informed that the sought war criminal has disappeared from his home in Argentina.  But--if the Mossad knew where the old man was living, why was he not apprehended there?  And then there are the oddly unpeopled tourist sites like the Sea of Galilee, where the gay character attempts buddy-bonding and pretends to ""walk on water"" (like Jesus and his disciples, the film all but screams).  When the male leads shower naked on the (vacant) Dead Sea beach and discuss circumcision, many viewers must begin to wonder--and to become impatient, if not uncomfortable.  And, alas, patience will be further strained as the plot dribbles along, without climax, to a maudlin conclusion.  Overly long and plodding, the film--though decently shot and performed--will likely result in a dissatisfaction common to more cheaply produced fare.  Many audience members may feel had by a movie that advertises gritty suspense and delivers soft-soaped propaganda.",1262563200,,1298,5.287804878048781

Yes, it has all the politically correct sentimentality that has made movie-going such a bore, but in the end the film says something and says it well. If Mel Gibson had been in the lead, I predict it would have been a blockbuster. Instead, it is a quiet, decent little morality play. The gayness of the brother seems gratuitous, and leads nowhere, but it is not as offensive as others have suggested and it does not spin the movie in a new direction as one might have anticipated. Instead, the issue is brought up and then disappears, creating a sub theme of no consequence. One was waiting for something connecting gender and morality, possibly undermining our notions of masculinity and morality, but this is dropped.  The main theme of guilt and dread and forgiveness plays out toward an end that works. I happen to think that the central plot really works, although it does depend on the obtuseness and naivete of the brother who never suspects the Mossad agent, although his clever mother has her suspicions right away. The acting is absolutely acceptable if not thrilling and we can thank our lucky starts that the thing was not ruined by Hollywood hype.

I shouldn't give away the plot lines or the outcome other than to say our hero has to face a lot of his prejudices both sexually (non-explicit) and emotionally (the holocaust and those on the persecuting side who successfully escaped to other countries to live out their lives in peace and prosperity -- and anonymity).

2343080,2,B0009YVBGO,"It is refreshing to watch movies depicting things other than American suburbia and exploding cars, and speaking several languages with naturalness, and seeing actors move against truly urban and/or exotic backdrops.
Yes, I confess, I am one of those people who ravenously scour the BlockBuster and takes anything foreign that looks remotely promising.

But this movie severely tested my patience.
I can't decide whether it is that Lior Ashkenazi and Knut Berger are bad actors, or the plot simply forces them to act in such a stiff way, that they can't perform.

If this movie aims at encompassing the subjects of hatred, identity, homosexuality, war, and forgiveness, and then produce some sort of coherent message, it fails. Instead of a plot, we have characters engaging, more or less randomly, in sanctimonious exchanges that don't add up to much, followed by the occasional gratuitous cruelty.

Paradoxically, the less important the characters, the best the acting is.  Gideon Shemer is good as the mild-mannered, avuncular secret service S.O.B. Axel's mother and father are also solid and give a credible performance. Even the short appearances of the rest of the Mossad staff are credible and to the point.

But as soon as Eyal (Ashklenazi) embarks in some statement about the Holocaust or the Palestinians, or Axel (Berger) tries so hard to play the liberal-assumed-homosexual-that-can-be-friends-with-an-hetero, the movie stops dead.

At some point the movie is so trite that becomes annoying.
-Axel's Grandpa is a Nazi war criminal. Gee, I wonder to what Argentine country he fled.
-Eyal has to come, reluctantly, to Germany. Gee, I wonder what is going to happen in the subway when their friends cross a group of skinheads.
-Axel and Eyal have to bath together. Gee, I wonder about what semitic ritual operation they will talk about (all in a safe, heterosexual way, of course).

Wonderful film about young Israeli assassin and spy who travels around the world terminating members of Mossad and all otherwise labeled enemies of the Israeli state.  Our main character Eyal gets a special assignment to find grandfather of the young German brother and sister who was Nazi committing crimes against humanity during WWII.  Eyal uses these young siblings as a source of information on the old Nazi fugitive who has been hiding in Argentina for decades.  But as Eyal is working on this assignment, he is also fighting his own demons.  Iris, a woman whom he loved, has committed suicide and in spite of him pushing aside his true feelings about this event, Eyal is forced to accept inevitable psychological changes that are slowly but surely overpowering him.  As Eyal becomes close to siblings Axel adn Pia, he starts to understand his own self and comes to a point when he has to either accept or reject his new self.  This is not a traditional spy movie, as we enjoy Eyal's humorous remarks.  He is being funny with his superiors, and anyone who crosses his path.

2343093,4,B0009YVBGO,"This film is a neatly told and affecting story, focusing on a Mossad agent who begins to question the point of some of the missions he's been sent on.  Lior Ashkenazi is excellent as Eyal, the agent in question.  Ashkenazi is a remarkable actor in that although he looks stolid and boring in still photos, as soon as he's moving in front of a camera he's extraordinarily subtle and involving; he also bears a remarkable resemblance to British actor Clive Owen (Croupier), but for my money he's a better actor than Owen.  Knut Berger and Catherine Peters are similarly excellent as the German brother and sister who start out as Eyal's marks but end up as his friends.  The soundtrack is quirky and fun and the movie as a whole is a bit of a triumph, in that it can be enjoyed be people (such as my wife) who are not all that interested in Israel or the Middle East, but just like and appreciate a good movie.

I find it odd that the very small minority of nutcases who really hate this movie have a perception of it as a 'gay film'.  I am a secular heterosexual film fan who has loved the work of gay filmmakers such as the UK's Derek Jarman, but while homosexuality is a theme in this film, it's hardly The Theme.  Eytan Fox would go on to make 'Yossi and Jagger', about two male Israeli soldiers who fall in love with each other; I haven't seen it, but on the strength of this little gem I'll give it a go.",1186963200,4,1408,4.2706766917293235

2343095,4,B0009YVBGO,"""Walk on Water"" is courageous film, confidently directed by Eytan Fox based on the screenplay written by his partner Gal Uchovsky and well acted.  Its subject is a Mossad's agent  whose new mission is to hunt the former Nazi criminal who lives nowadays  somewhere in South America. In order to trace him,  Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi) takes a job as a tourist guide for  the grandson of war criminal - sociable, open, friendly young German, Axel. Axel  arrives to Israel to visit his sister Pia who chose to live in Israel and work in a kibbutz and to talk her into reconciling with their parents.  Eyal  drives Alex in his SUV, shows him the country. They sit on the coast of  Dead Sea, both  smeared by celebrated therapeutic mud from neck to toes. In another scene,  Alex tries to walk on the water of Kinarteth (the Sea of Galilee); three of them visit the gay- bar in Tel Aviv - Alex does not hide his sexual orientation.

The characters are interesting and compelling. The story is engaging and I feel connected to the movie the way very few movies make me. I recognize the places I've been to and I've come to love and to dream of seeing them again and again.  The film starts in Istanbul, Turkey on the boat over the Bosphor and the guide talks about the bridge between Europe and Asia. I've been on the boat like that and I saw the bridge. Then the action takes place in Israel and I was happy to recognize  Tel Aviv,  Jerusalem, The Sea of Galilee (Kinereth), The Dead Sea where one just floats without swimming, the desert.

The plot moves from Israel to Berlin where Eyal is visiting with his new friend's family. Alex's and Pia's father celebrates his anniversary and for the first time, a helpless dying old man arrives to Berlin, the Nazi criminal, Axel's and Pia's grandfather, Eyal's target. The film explores the moral dead ends of the modern society full of hostility and old unpaid debts.  Eyal remembers the history of his country and its people, he knows not from the books about Holocaust. He is a soldier and must be merciless but he has to learn something about understanding from his young German friend.  Film attracts by the non-standard approach to the familiar themes of religious prejudices, homophobia, neo-fascism, newest terror and other sources of the hatred, which destroys the world. It would not surprise me to find out that the film has many detractors in Germany, Palestine, and in Israel. The final is a little too neat and belongs to the modern fairy tale genre. I see it as the director's dream that he wanted to come true - the people with different backgrounds, mentalities, history, and preferences would understand one another and would come toward one another with the open hearts and clean thoughts.

2343096,4,B0009YVBGO,"An unusual spy thriller from Israel, Walk on Water's first scene follows Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi, a fine and handsome actor, somewhat reminiscent of Clive Owen, and who played a quite different character in the comedy Late Marriage), a tough-minded Mossad agent, as he coolly kills a Hamas operative in Istanbul in front of his family. Soon after returning from this mission, though, his wife commits suicide, so his superiors decide to give him what looks like a light assignment: posing as the tour guide of a couple of German tourists (a brother and sister) in order to become friendly with them and find out if they know about the whereabouts of their grandfather (a former nazi, who is presumably still living in Argentina). As it happens, the Germans are very different in their outlook from Eyal - they are liberal types who want to understand why Palestinian terrorists are willing to blow themselves to pieces - this humanization of the Palestinians infuriates the tough Sabra. The Germans are different in another way - the brother is gay, in contrast with the very macho Eyal, and much is made in the movie about their uneasy relationship. The final act of the movie, as Eyal goes to Germany to deal with their grandfather is more contrived, less believable, but the movie overall is highly entertaining and thought provoking.",1175904000,3,1334,4.907079646017699

2343098,1,B0009YVBGO,"This is a pathetic, shallow movie that insults person's intelligence.

It is quite anti-semitic, by showing Jews not the way they are, but the way Jew-haters want to see them: as heartless bullies, obsessed with vengeance.

The scene of an Israeli Mossad agent killing an Arab man on the street in Turkey before the eyes of his wife and little son elicits sympathy for the victim. We have been told that this was a Hamas leader, but this does not get much emphasis in the movie. The effect would be very different, if they would show first mass murder of innocent Jews done by such types as this Hamas leader.

In this the movie is very manipulative.

All three Mossad agents shown in the movie are caricature-like, made very cruel and unattractive.

It is emphasized that the motivation for Mossad is vengeance and inability to forgive, but the truth is the vengeance is not a main motivation for Jews, but justice is.

If those Hamas murders are left alive, they will cause many more murders, and it is immoral to let them live.

As to the part of the movie showing the pursuit of an old ex-nazi, it is totally stupid and unrealistic, and again vengeance is wrongly emphasized as motivation.

To sum up, this is a sad and un-artistic creation of degenerate secular Israeli culture, done by people without any healthy self-respect and any knowledge about their rich, beautiful and eternal Jewish tradition, which always did and still provokes hate from enemies of civilization.",1166918400,12,1478,4.768627450980392
2343099,5,B0009YVBGO,"This 2004 Israeli film captured my interest from the very first frame and held it throughout this tightly woven story.

Even before the credits roll we meet Eyal, played by Lior Askenazi, assassinating someone.  It's a scene that plays fast and cruel, especially since the small child of the victim watches it all with big-eyed wonder.  We quickly learn that Eyal is a Mossad agent who, after being warmly acknowledged by his Israeli superiors, goes home to find that his wife has committed suicide.  All of this happens in the first ten minutes, setting a background for an intriguing story.

The Mossad still want to bring every single Nazi war criminal to justice, even though the few of them still alive are quite elderly.  The granddaughter of one of them has emigrated to Israel and now lives in a Kibbutz.  Her brother is coming to visit her.  Eyal is ordered to act as a tour guide for the brother and try to get information about the grandfather.  Eyal wants to decline.  He thinks the Israelis should ""get over"" the atrocities of WWII which happened long before he was born, but he accepts the assignment.  The German brother, Knut, played by Axel Himmelman, at first seems like a nerd. Eyal is bored with him and with his sister and doesn't want to do this assignment.  But, after bugging their apartment, he hears Knut, who happens to be gay, try to convince his sister to come home to Germany because the grandfather might just come back from Argentina, where he has lived for the past 50 years, for a birthday celebration.  She refuses.  She has chosen to live in a Kibbutz to atone for her family's part in the War and doesn't want to have anything to do with her Nazi grandfather.

Eyal, acting as a tour guide, now takes Knut on a sightseeing trip.  Knut is a pacifist and Eyal scoffs at that.  Eyal sees himself as tough and tries not to think deeply about the violence around him.  He despises Palestinians and is very reluctant to take Knut to a Palestinian city where Knut  makes a connection with a gay Palestinian and soon Eyal, the sister and the brother are going to a large and loud party where everyone is having a good time.  There's definitely tension between the brother and Eyal and the director made sure to do a scene where they visit the Dead Sea and then take outdoor showers together.

Soon though, Knut returns to Germany and Eyal is commanded to go there to murder the elderly grandfather.  Here, there's a scene where Eyal pulls a gun on some street toughs who attack some of the brother's transvestite friends.  All of a sudden, it is clear that he is a trained assassin and Knut's suspicions are aroused.

How this all plays out is fascinating.  Here is the Israeli agent now being invited to the palatial home of Knut's parents to honor the elderly Nazi war criminal.  What happens then is the crux of the story.

I loved this film even though there were a few details of script that used some silly plot devices.  But the acting was wonderful and I appreciated the kind of moral questions the story raised.  I also liked the settings and the use of languages.  The Israeli characters spoke Hebrew to each other.  The German and Israeli characters spoke English to each other.  And the German characters spoke German to each other.  Even a small detail like this added to the authenticity of the film.

Walk on Water takes a unique spin on events as real as today's headlines.  I don't remember it ever being released in theaters.  But it is on DVD.  So please do see it if you can.",1166918400,7,3524,4.545310015898251
2343109,5,B0009YVBGO,"This film is about finding a Nazi approximately 50 years after World War II in order to assassinate him. The Mossad agent, Eyal, just returned from Turkey and killed a terrorist there. His new assignment is to be a tour guide to a young German named Alex Himmelman, whose grandfather was the Nazi killer. The plan is to get friendly with this tourist and learn whether or not his grandfather is still alive, then ""to do God's work before God is ready to take him"" according to the Director of Mossad. The elder Himmellman is believed to be alive in Argentina where he escaped after the war. Unfortunately, when Eyal arrives home after the Turkish assignment, he finds his wife dead on their bed. She had committed suicide ... This life-altering event may affect his judgement and skills according to his superior. He is offered counseling but declines. His  shooting abilities are tested on a target range from time to time, to ensure he is able to complete this important mission.

The film is fascinating on many levels. It delves into a deeply serious subject and questions the ethics of doing this type of work in a most creative and artistic manner. As Eyal becomes more friendly with Alex and his sister Pia who lives on a kibbutz, he begins to like them. Eyal places a bug in Pia's apartment to catch any conversation they may have about their grandfather's past. The conversations are all innocent until one night, when Alex tries to pursuade Pia to return to Berlin to visit her parents, to attend her father's birthday party. It turns out, Pia  had a huge fight with her dad about the cover-up of what her grandfather had done during the war. One does wonder, why does the granddaughter of a Nazi end up working in a kibbutz in Israel? The film builds suspense and mystery based on this very question. The complex nature of the film makes it a superior viewing experience. The subject of the film is dealt with in a senstive manner and is balanced with humor. Eyal is played by a very handsome Israeli actor who befriends Alex and then learns by chance that Alex is gay. This subject is presented in a natural flow within the story line of the film ... The metaphor of ""walking on water"" as Jesus did on the Sea of Galilee is used with great affect and meaning. The viewer will be thrilled and entertained as intensity builds and the mysteries become more complex before they are resolved. There is a huge unexpected climax before the surprise ending brings about a 360 degree resolution to the conflicts. This is a most highly recommended viewing experience.

I had not seen Lior Ashkenazi, Knut Berger nor Caroline Peters in any movie before, but because of this movie, I plan to search out and watch other movies of theirs. The director, Eytan Fox, was born in New York, but was 2 when his family immigrated to Israel. I will also have to check out other movies he directed, as he did a wonderful job in this movie.

The last part of this movie was totally unexpected. What happened in Germany and then back in Israel. I don't want to make this review a spoilier, so I won't say just what it was. But I will say this, the movie ended happily, which doesn't happen too often in a movie of this kind.

So anyone who is interested in German-Jewish relations will throughly enjoy this movie. Also anyone who enjoys surprises in a movie, will enjoy this movie. Plus it is a little bit of Israeli James Bond. And if you like a happy-feel good ending, this is the movie for you.

And for those of you who don't speak Hebrew or German, don't worry, most of the movie is in English and what isn't has subtitles.",1162512000,27,1302,4.280487804878049

Nonetheless, this tale about an existentially challenged Mossad hit man is challenging.  The acting is superb.  Israel is truly a beautiful country and its people generous and civilized.

2343116,4,B0009YVBGO,"A year before Stephen Speilberg's overblown, albeit effective, ""Munich,"" came a much smaller film exploring essentially the same moral dilemma - becoming that which we fight against - but with a less pessimistic outcome.

Eyal is an effective assassin, who loves his work, but enters a crisis in confidence when the tear-streaked face of his latest target's son imprints on his memory.  The crisis is exacerbated when he finds his wife's body after her suicide in their bedroom, and reads the suicide note, the content of which comes into play throughout the movie.

Eyal's handler, Menachem, suspects his wavering resolve, but takes a hand in rehabilitating him by assigning him to an investigation that is off Mossad's books, but within its mission of hunting down Nazi war criminals.  Eyal's vulnerable state allows him to connect with the grandchildren of the Nazi being hunted, resulting in his further humanization.

Although the plot plays out to a low-key, surprising, and totally apt conclusion the overall effect is slightly marred with a coda that is touching, but unnecessary.

All in all, though, this is a movie in which everything comes together:  a believable script, detailed direction, and absolutely incredible casting in which every character seems right.  It's only the coda that keeps me from giving it five stars.",1136246400,,1336,5.181395348837209

2343121,4,B0009YVBGO,"Walk on Water is the kind of film that critics will enjoy much more than the average viewer.  It's a serious movie, one dealing with a whole assortment of complex issues far bigger than the characters themselves; I found it surprisingly morally ambivalent, though.  It has many ways to make the viewer feel uncomfortable, and some folks don't like that feeling.  And, truth be told, I don't think it went as deeply into these characters' minds as it could have, and that gives the final scene something of a false ring.  Is it an excellent film?  Yes.  Did I enjoy it?  Not so much.

Lior Ashkenazi plays Eyal, an Israeli agent specializing in quiet assassination.  After returning home following a successful mission against a Hamas leader, he finds his wife dead by her own hands and a farewell note (the contents of which we hear only at the end of the film).  He internalizes his grief and continues work - only his boss has now given him an assignment he cares little about.  A Nazi war criminal has disappeared from his home in Argentina, and the boss thinks that the man's grandchildren may provide the key to his location.  And so it is that Eyal takes on the role of an Israeli tour guide to show Axel Himmelman (Knut Berger) the sights when he arrives to visit his sister Pia (Carolina Peters) in Israel - even though Eyal really doesn't care about exacting justice on a long-ago killer with one foot already in the grave.  He and Axel develop a strange kind of relationship over the course of a couple of weeks, though.  Axel is the kind of guy who wonders how desperate the Palestinian suicide bombers must be to do what they do, while Eyal considers them animals.  Eyal wants to know what it was like when Axel first came to understand what his countrymen had done during World War II, but neither man seems all that passionate about the subject.  The two men also discuss much more than I cared to hear about homosexuality, as Axel is openly gay - even taking a Palestinian friend during his visit.  I should also add that I saw far more of these men than I wanted to, as I never expected to see a scene featuring full frontal nudity in this film - but it's there.  I really could have done without that.

The film did let me take a gander at several historic sites in Israel, but the latter half of the film shifts to Germany.  It is there that Eyal will have to come to terms with all of the feelings churning inside him since his wife's suicide.  Ultimately, he faces a moral choice that forces him to reexamine his whole life.  In the end, I can't say I really know how to interpret this film, as it asks deep questions without providing answers (largely because there really are no answers).  This is an almost exclusively psychological film; don't expect to see a lot of action scenes.  The story is about tearing down walls, coming to terms with the past, and - albeit slightly - looking ahead to a better future.  To me, though, the whole thing was just too morally ambivalent, as the film tries to take on too many big issues at one and the same time.",1132358400,7,3074,4.446428571428571
2343122,5,B0009YVBGO,"Eyal is an assassin for the Israeli secret service, and is put on a mission to find an elderly Nazi known for his war crimes that has been in hiding, and suspected of still being alive. After the suicide of his wife, Eyal, a man who has never been able to cry, finds his life changing through the circumstances and people he meets on the mission. The award-winning ""Walk on Water"" is a tri-lingual film so brilliantly written and cast, that there is not a single scene that is not relevant, and it captures one's attention from start to finish.

Lior Ashkenazi is fantastic as Eyal, and Knut Berger gives a sensitive, terrific performance as Axel, the grandson of the old Nazi. Also good are Caroline Peters as his sister Pia, and Gideon Shemer as Menachem, Eyal's boss. Peters and Berger also had a hand in writing the marvelous script. Directed with perfect pacing by Eytan Fox, one also gets a cinematic tour of Israel, and parts of Berlin, which add to the interest of the film.

""Walk on Water"" is a psychological drama, as well as a spy thriller, and touches on many facets of human life. Eyal, the man who ""kills everything that comes near him,"" discovers life within himself, and comes to acceptance of himself and others, through Axel, his opposite in every way. In Hebrew, English, and German with subtitles, this film is worthy of one's time and stands up to many viewings, thanks to its taut, intelligent script and superb acting. Total running time is 103 minutes, and though the box says there is a ""Making-of Featurette,"" my DVD does not include it on the menu.",1132358400,47,1576,4.604982206405694

2343125,5,B0009YVBGO,"WALK ON WATER, directed by Eytan Fox, is as good a movie as  you're likely to see. It is well directed, acted and photographed and has a great soundtrack including music by Bruce Springsteen, Buffalo Springfield and Gigliola Cinquetti. The linear plot is straight-forward and powerful.  Eyal (Lior Ashkenzai), in the Israeli Secret Service, is in the business of killing terrorists. After the death of his wife, however, he gets a new assignment: to track down and take out an aging Nazi war criminal ""before God does."" The Nazi's gay grandson Axel (Knut Berger) will soon be visiting his sister Pia (Caroline Peters) who has left Berlin to live in a kibbutz in Israel. Eyal poses as an employee of ""Horizon Tours Israel"" in order to get close to the German brother and sister in an effort to find their grandfather.

Although all the actors give fine performances, the movie ultimately belongs to Ashkenzai with his swarthy good looks and moody blue eyes. It is fascinating to watch him grow from a methodical killer to someone else entirely. (I won't give away the plot here.) The director does not shy away from difficult questions: Why are Palestinians desperate enough to become suicide bombers? Is it always necessary to take vengence in your own hands? Are there circumstances when you should leave an old, sick criminal to heaven? Can you love the children (or grandchildren) of an enemy? Does killing breed more killing? Can straight men and gay men be friends?

The movie is ultimately about hope and forgiveness. The ending that takes place at the Sea of Galilee, which is all about the title of the movie, will take your breath away.",1128556800,86,1645,4.822695035460993

2343127,5,B0009YVBGO,"On August 30, the North American (NTSC) version was released, and the one I had pre-ordered was recently delivered. For the last two months, I'd had the PAL edition I had ordered directly from Israel. When I watched the NTSC version, I was able to compare the two editions.

First, the PAL edition really does have a better picture, because it has 20% more lines of resolution on the screen, but the NTSC picture looked pretty good. The NTSC edition has larger yellow subtitles (the PAL ones are a bit smaller and white), but the yellow subtitles looked a bit fuzzy around the edges on my large-screen TV, even though the rest of the picture was quite clear. The white subtitles looked a bit sharper.

On the Israeli edition, you have options of no subtitles, English subtitles, or Hebrew subtitles (which I found useful when some of the accented English was hard to understand). On the NA version, it's either English for everything (captioning), or just English when Hebrew or German were being spoken.

Now the bad part. The Israeli version just starts with a 30-second commercial, all in Hebrew, advertising a brand of TV and then goes right into the movie, with a much classier opening montage behind the menu. The NA version starts with a whopping EIGHT previews, unless you intercept them first, in which case it just goes through all its groan-inducing FBI warnings, and then several studio headers, and releasing info and such, before the movie finally starts.

But the WORST difference? The Israeli version is loaded with fascinating cast interviews, background information about the making of the movie, theatre trailers for the movie, a feature about all the excitement when it opened at the Berlin Film Festival, and a segment where a well-known Israeli TV interviewer does a promo for the film. Much of it is in Hebrew, but with English subtitles.

It turns out, for example, that Knut Berger really is gay. Caroline Peters' grandfather really was a Nazi (he was in the S.S., yet). Ernest Lenart, who plays the Nazi grandfather, is actually a German Jew who is himself a survivor of the Holocaust. Lior Ashkenazi, who plays toughguy Eyal has talked on live Israeli TV about having had an adult love affair with another man, like he does (implied) in this movie.

But you wouldn't know any of that if you'd only bought the NA edition -- because contrarily, the NA edition has NOTHING in the way of extras, probably to make room for all eight of those previews! The case mentions a ""making of"" feature, but it isn't listed anywhere on the menu. And believe me, I looked for it. Whose idea was THAT?

By the way, I notice that, in interviews, the director has been confirming what I said about the real relationship between the two men. It's almost comical to see people being miffed at the suggestion they were intimate, as if they can't grasp that a macho guy could also be attracted to a man.

Personally, I think the director and his gay spouse of 17 years (who wrote the screenplay), planned it as a clever ""in-joke"" just to see who of the non-gay audience would ""get it"".  From the looks of it, it looks like not many did....",1126742400,20,3142,4.687840290381125
2343128,1,B0009YVBGO,"First and foremost I would like to say that this is a lousy gay flick, not a movie about healing the wound of the holocaust. What I got out of this movie was that any one who wrongs Jews or Israel for that matter is gay and is deserving of death. Here the Israeli agent Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi) is an honorable patriotic hetero struggling to forgive the gay German and his gay Palestinian lover. The movie ends w/ Eyal forgiving the gay German but w/ no hint whether he will forgive his gay Palestinian neighbors.

2343148,4,B0009YVBGO,"We saw the Israeli film Walk on Water last night. This is a very intriguing film about baggage. Heavy emotional baggage. Not just ""I'm haunted by my wife who committed suicide"" kind of baggage (though there is that too), but even deeper collective cultural/national undercurrents, the burden of guilt of entire peoples and entire generations. Not just Israelis and Palestinians (though there is that too), but Israelis and Germans, younger Israelis and older Israelis, younger Germans and older Germans, and the inevitable 700-pound gorilla in that room, the Holocaust. And as if there's not enough psychic conflict to be mined in all of that fodder, layer on top of it a macho straight man confronting homosexuality. If this sounds like a recipe for a massively iconic story full of plot and characters contrived to effect the necessary symbolic gestures, it is indeed that. But the amazing thing is that the characters are genuinely and engagingly enacted, and I found myself pulled into their unusual story. The symbolism crept in disarmingly, not pedantically. The symbols were inhabited by dimensional people with real charms and flaws. Or perhaps it was just that each character was animated by multiple symbolic types at the same time, making them complex and multi-dimensional, rather than flat stereotypes. Either way, I found it fresh and engaging. (And along the way, a nice scenic Israel travelogue as well.) The title comes from an early scene with one character standing at the Sea of Galilee, and musing that he thinks it is possible to walk on the water, but you have to cleanse yourself first, completely unburden your heart. The film of course then shows us that completely unburdening one's heart is as easy as walking on water. You may not be completely unburdened of your baggage at the end of the film, but at least you'll know where some of the handles are.",1126569600,11,1880,4.9714285714285715
2343149,5,B0009YVBGO,"I found this movie to be a very moving and profound movie experience.  ""Walk on Water"" tackles some very ""heavy"" issues-the ""gay/straight"" issue, the Israeli/ Palestinian issue the German/Jewish issue which are all very intense thought provoking things to think about and to deal with.  However, in this marvelous movie no definite answers, to the aforesaid conflicts, are given.  The movie just reflects human beings coming together and understanding each other a little more than they did before and ultimately becoming better people just by getting to know another human that might be radically different than they are.

The character Eyal, at the beginning of the movie, starts off as a cold, unsmiling, unfeeling, extremely ""butch""  ""hit man"" for a very militant Israeli fringe faction.  One of his assignments is to infiltrate a German family in order to find out the whereabouts of the German family's old grandfather who was a murdering Nazi during the Nazi era and who has been hiding out in Argentina since the war.  His mission, of course, is to kill him.  The old Nazi's grandchildren are in Israel. The granddaughter is, defiantly, living in a kibbutz (she knows of her grandfather's Nazi background); the gay grandson comes to visit his sister with the idea of persuading her to return to Germany for their father's 70th birthday.  Eyal, the mercenary poses as a tour guide to Axel the gay grandson.  Eyal and Axel become unlikely friends.  Their friendship ultimately changes the lives of ALL involved.

It really irritates me that some reviewers on other boards have reduced the blossoming friendship of Eyal (a straight man) and  Axel (a gay man) to just merely one of sexual attraction.  I failed to see the sexual attraction between the two men.  I only saw a life changing friendship between the two men.  It might come as a surprise to some in our society that it IS possible for a gay man and a straight man to form a deep, lasting and yes an affectionate friendship that is NOT sexual.  I KNOW this from experience.  Anyway, the friendship between Axel and Eyal changes them both-Eyal becomes more human and moves beyond a ""killing machine""-he even learns to laugh and to realize that friendship can be found in someone that is different than him, a gay man! Axel learns to have more understanding of some very deep issues (i.e., the German/Jewish and Israeli/Palestinian conflicts)--the bottom line is that Eyal marries Axel's sister NOT Axel!!

The acting by all involved is superb.  I can see why Lior Ashkenazi (Eyal) is a big star in Israel.  He is not only easy on the eye but a very dynamic actor.  Watch his eyes; they express volumes.  You can see him go from an unfeeling and unloving person that is capable of injecting poison into a smiling little boy's father without blinking to a baby bouncing father with sentimental dreams.  This great film wonderfully shows this amazing transformation.

2343151,5,B0009YVBGO,"Director Fox and Writer Uchovsky have certainly tackled some huge issues here: the Holocaust, Israel's relations with neighboring countries, and not necessarily least, relations between gays and straights (the latter being about as ""mine-field dangerous"" as the subject of Israelis connecting with Palestinians).  Of course, with over 15 years as apparently loving partners, these two men should have some expertise in at least one of the three issues just mentioned (I'll let you, dear reader, decide which).  Not, myself, being in the slightest an expert on the Holocaust or Israeli foreign relations, I believe I'll keep the following comments aimed in the general direction of that third issue.

There have been tons of conjecture on major movie website Boards as to what was the ""real"" relationship between Eyal and Axel (and where it might have been heading).  Apparently Director Fox has been quoted to the effect that ""Walk on Water"" is based on a true story of which he'd become aware. That story involved a real-life Mossad agent who had come home one day and found his wife hanging from the ceiling.  She'd left a note saying how hard life had become with him, living with a killer who'd turned into someone emotionally closed.  The agent cracked on his next assignment, left Mossad and enrolled in university, studying literature and art.  There he met a young boy and fell in love with him.  Eventually the former agent does meet his lover's sister, falls in love with her, and they begin a family together.

As a several times viewer of this movie, I've never found much indication that the gay, real-life ""near-ending"" described by Fox ever made it into this film of his. Nevertheless, perhaps he was leaving a little room for just such speculation when he gave us this film's near-end Berlin bedroom scene between Eyal and Axel.  And, when all is said and done, the film does conclude with the two of them back in that Sea of Galilee beach scene, and Eyal's closing it all out with his (what I'll call) ""Ode to Axel.""

Lastly though, it does have to be acknowledged that movies with too much of a gay theme are, obviously, hard sells anywhere:  US, Europe and Israel, no doubt.  Directors and writers have to look out for the old pocketbook....and rightfully so.",1126224000,8,2278,4.855297157622739

The film tackles some pretty heavy generation affecting issues like the Holocaust, the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, and Gay/Straight issues, then has the characters in the film reconcile them on a personal level.

The film had an interesting storyline, provided interesting character studies, had some songs I liked, and had an ending which seemed to fit and left me liking the film even more on retrospect.",1126224000,2,610,5.278350515463917
2343153,5,B0009YVBGO,"Eytan Fox follows up his excellent little gem ""Yossi & Jagger"" with another winner that is even better than his last. I honestly am not sure why I loved ""Walk on Water"" as much as I did because, in a way, there isn`t much to it, at least not on the surface. It's a really subtle film, both simple and complex at the same time. But there was just something there that made it very engrossing. I came to really care about the characters and found the friendship that develops between Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi) and Axel (Knut Berger) really nice and touching.

The acting was absolutely terrific and some of the best of the year. Knut Berger (The Edukators, Sugar Orange) was very appealing and immensely likable as Axel. Him and Lior Ashkenazi, who reminds me of Clive Owen, complimented each other nicely. While not in the film quite as much, Carolina Peters was also solid as Pia.

""Walk on Water"" seems like it's going to be a thriller, but really ends up being more of a character study, and it might just be better off for it. Political dramas are not usually my thing, but ""Walk on Water"" ended up fascinating me rather than boring me. I didn't really want it to end, especially as the last 25 minutes or so are the best. There were a few great scenes during this time. I loved when Eyal beat up the gay bashers. It made him that much more likable. And I also loved the last three scenes.

It would be great to see this get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Foreign Film"" but it's doubtful it will, even with the good reviews, since it was released earlier in the year. Movies that are, especially smaller ones, are usually forgotten by then, which is really unfortunate. This is a gem that deserves to be seen. After two excellent films I'm looking forward to seeing what Eytan Fox does next. I'm also interested in seeing Knut Berger in future films.

While it won't be for everyone, I still highly recommend ""Walk on Water.""

2343154,5,B0009YVBGO,"Eytan Fox ('Yossi & Jagger', and others) is an important director to watch. Born in the USA and emigrated to Israel at the age of two, Fox understands the art of cinematic storytelling and in WALK ON WATER he brings this impressive tale of universal and personal forgiveness written by Gal Uchovsky with collaboration by actors Knut Berger and Caroline Peters, and Andreas Struck to the screen with finesse, subtlety, and grace. His in a name to watch.

Films dealing with the aftermath of Hitler's annihilation of the Jews and their subsequent formation of the haven Israel have been many and variably successful, primarily because the Jew vs Nazi histories have been so polarized to appeal to all audiences who need to have good guys vs bad guys easily identified for them. This beautiful film refuses to go there, but instead mixes the young people of Germany and Israel in a manner that finally enlightens us as to the process of letting go, of forgiveness in order to move ahead with living.

Eyal (the dashingly handsome and sensitive actor Lior Ashkenazi) works for the Israeli group headed by Menachem (Gideon Shemer) whose life's work it is to track down and kill all remaining Nazi perpetrators of the concentration camps. Eyal is a damaged man, his wife has committed suicide partially because of his job as hired assassin of anti-Israeli people, and he has finally grown weary of Menachem's obsession to exterminate all living Nazis. Yet he is assigned one more 'victim', an old man who is the grandfather of two German young people - Pia (Caroline Peters) who happily lives in an Israeli kibbutz and her brother Axel (Knut Berger) who has come to Israel to plead with his sister to return to Berlin to her estranged parents for her father's birthday. Pia knows of her grandfather's Nazi war crimes and resents that her parents had helped him escape from being tried as a war criminal.

Menachem assigns Eyal to be Axel's 'tour guide' in Israel, hoping to find a path to their grandfather, the war criminal. Axel is gay and during his time with Eyal touring the sites of Israel the two grow warmly as friends, Eyal asking many penetrating questions about Axel's gay lifestyle. Pia, Axel and Eyal become friends and when Pia refuses to join Axel in returning to Berlin for the father's birthday, Eyal 'consents' to accompany him. Several incidents occur both in Israel and Berlin that bond Eyal and Axel and that unveil some of Eyal's shaky demons of Arab hate, homophobia, and guilt over his wife's suicide. Yet for the first time Eyal has a man with whom he can relate and he grows fond of Axel.

In Berlin Eyal is warmly accepted into Axel's vast home. At the birthday party Axel displays his love for Israeli folk dancing as a gift to his father, engendering kind feelings from Eyal. But suddenly the grandfather is wheeled into the room by his attending nurse, repulsing Axel, and Eyal leaves: Meachem has followed him to Berlin and tells Eyal to terminate the old man. Eyal returns to the house and is unable to carryout his task, and the resulting resolution of the 'deed' and the manner in which Eyal and Axel come together is one of those magic moments of storytelling, one that equates with the miraculous ability to walk on water.

The cast is superb, always allowing us to see the hidden corners of intent, motivation, and lasting resentment as well as the opening of the doors of ultimate forgiveness and life. WALK ON WATER is a thriller, an espionage film, an historic moment, and a love story told with richly detailed sensitivity and bravura. Highly Recomended.

2343155,5,B0009YVBGO,"Finally, I get to review the best movie I've seen in ages.  Even when ""Walk on Water"" was playing here at our local theater, it didn't show up in the unreliable ""Movie Showtimes"" feature on amazon.  So, the only way to express my zeal for it was to review the obscure (from a US perspective) PAL release.  Lior Ashkenazi is Israel's biggest screen star right now. This film demonstrates why.  He's a magnetic presence.

How good a movie is this?  Imagine a movie about the Mossad that also shows up in amazon member lists until the heading ""Great gay films you might have missed.""  Or, imagine an Israeli-released film that manages to be sensitive to Palestinians while also showing Mossad carrying out a hit. Or one that takes on the always delicate issues of Nazism and how today's young German generation is dealing with that past.  All of that takes balance and nuance, which ""Walk's"" writing, direction and acting has in spades.

I encourage all fans of international cimena to please make time to see ""Walk on Water.""  It's well worth the effort.",1123027200,4,1052,4.699453551912568
2343156,2,B0009YVBGO,"I was pretty surprised to read the other reviews of this film, which is one of the more corny, trite creations to come out the (actually pretty good) contemporary Israeli film industry. I won't reiterate the plot, which was aptly described by other reviewers, but I will recommend that you not purchase this film. If you happen to come across it and have an evening to kill, it's mildly entertaining, but that's about it.

What irritated me so is that this movie touches on important issues that could have been explored in some worthy way - how do soldiers live with having to perform targeted assassinations for the greater good, for example; or, how Israelis feel about young Germans. Unfortunately, the filmmaker refused to really grapple with any of these issues, happily resting on clichs instead. Every figure in this movie is a clich-and even worse, an unexplored clich. The Mossad agent is, predictably, tough, manly, confused and ultimately saved by love; the older German generation--evil and formal; the young gay guy - sensitive and kind. One clich after another - nothing real at all.

In some ways, the only topic with which the movie really does try to grapple is homosexuality. In fact, it's probably best categorized as a gay film. Even there, I felt that the figure of Axel-the young gay German-is a cutout. His ease with his sexual tendencies seemed to me more an artifact of gay propaganda than a real image of the conflicting emotions that gay people often feel about their identity in a straight world.

The acting is so-so. The worst is the protagonist, Lior Ashkenazi, who looks like he's working very hard at method acting. The best portrayal is that of Knut Berger (Axel), who, despite having a terrible script, manages to come across as genuinely human and intelligent. Although young, he is a more confident actor, who doesn't try as hard and it shows. I think he has real acting talent, which may come out with better direction.

Perhaps the real problem is that, as an Israeli, I could spot the fraud that this film really is.",1121385600,7,2057,4.785915492957747
2343157,5,B0009YVBGO,"This movie attempts to show the effects that 2 of the world's most notorious conflicts have on today's society.  Namely, the World War 2 and the Israel - Palestine tension. In the film, Eyal's assassination of a Hamas leader is one of many by-products of the tension between Israel and Palestine.  In being tasked with tracking down a Nazi war criminal, Eyal is now faced with the fallouts that the World War 2 has on Jews and Germans, particularly the descendants of Germans who had lived through World War 2 and who perhaps may have participated in the war itself.

The film achieves a perfect balance in telling the story of violent conflicts and their after-effects as well as the story of human prejudices and reconciliation.  This is achieved through the softening of hard facts told in the story by the human emotions and relationships built up in in the film, thereby making this film easy to watch.  The film ends on a hopeful note for the world by emphasizing on two of the greatest of all human emotions: love and reconciliation.",1120953600,7,1040,4.6923076923076925

What a lie, there is some English but it is primarily in what I suspect is Hebrew.  I like to listen to the dialog in my movies and not have to read it, so please Amazon can you be honest about a movie's language so I don't waste my time?
