2442476,2,B000BVM1RI,"I picked this up in order to help complete my collection of cyberpunk films.  In the back of my mind I was hoping for additional footage, cut scenes, etc.

There is nothing extra here at all.  A very poorly done full screen cut and piss poor menu's.

Hopefully one day the DVD will come out in the US will all the additional footage and story additions.  Sadly I'm not holding my breath.",1143849600,3,387,4.319444444444445

2442519,1,B000BVM1RI,"Movie is lacking in superhero-esque ""Lawnmower-Man""
I was really hoping for a Batman style action movie in which a lowly landscaper, whose parents had been killed in a tragic seed related murder, would rise up to fight crime against his arch nemesis, El Weedo, the psychopath created in a dangerous herbicide accident.

Largely disappointed by mostly white cast, was expecting many more Mexicans.",1364256000,2,396,5.285714285714286

2442522,4,B000BVM1RI,"For the sci-fi group, these can be really interesting movies. Another takeoff on technology taking over the populace of the world. A computer enhanced individual getting a god complex and running amuck. I always liked the original and the sequel rounds the storyline out to mankind coming out on top.

2442523,3,B000BVM1RI,"Lawnmower Man is a great movie with a great storyline and fantastic visuals.  The acting is believeable with both Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey doing a slendid job.  Lawnmower Man 2 should have been put in the lawnmower.  When you hear about really bad sequels, this is what they were talking about.  Just get Lawnmower Man as a single and you won't be disappointed.",1254441600,,366,4.671875
2442524,4,B000BVM1RI,"This DVD is a double feature.  The 1992 Lawnmower Man stars Jeff Fahey and Pierce Brosnan.  Brosnan plays a scientist (Dr. Larry Angelo)who is developing a Virtual Reality software that he hopes to put to good use in waking up brain cells.  He experimented on animals, but found alarming and horrifying results.  The neighborhood lawnmowing guy, Jobe (Jeff Fahey), who is slightly retarded seems to be the perfect human experiment.  Jobe wants to be smarter so people won't take advantage of him, so he agrees to be the ""guinea pig"".  Almost instantly Jobe becomes smarter, but with horrible side effects.  Corporate America, whose only interest is in the money making aspect, wants to continue the experiment no matter what the human cost is.  Jobe becomes a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde character.  This movie takes you on a wild virtual reality journey that has not only aspects of sci-fi, but horror as well.  I would have given it 5 stars had The Lawnmower Man just been a solo.  The added feature, Lawnmower Man 2--Jobe's War, was a complete waste of watching!  The two stars, Brosnan and Fahey were missing and were desparately needed to pull this film through.  Jobe's War delt with the out of control now genius character, Jobe and his revenge against anyone that did him wrong.  The way Amazon packaged these two films is good in that for just a couple dollars more, you can get the double feature.  However, save yourself the agony of watching the second.  This just proves that the original movie is usually better than the sequel.",1189641600,2,1538,4.812977099236641

2442526,4,B000BVM1RI,"THE LAWNMOWER MAN

Virtual reality is the future of this world. At least that's what we all believed in 1991-1992. Today we would be more cautious. The film demonstrates this potential virtual reality has, but associated to some chemical, hence in a very unnatural way. It can wake up brain cells that have been dormant forever or for ages. It can multiply the learning power of a subject. It can also - that's what the film asserts - enhance the extra-sensorial powers of the brain. So far will I say we are on Strephen King's line. But here we depart and we can understand why Stephen King denied his paternity. The film becomes a horror film about rotten corporations in alliance with just as rotten administrative services of the government and with similarly rotten ambitious individuals, scientists or not, who are ready to use simple human beings, particularly retarded ones to experiement a drug and a treatment without any guarantee. This will eventually turn into a drama and the poor retarded boy who had suddenly become super intelligent will become a mixture of a justice maker, an avenger, and an illuminated prophet, whereas the scientist will try to do the same and destroy his work since it is so un-human and dangerous. We thus more or less end up in fear.

THE LAWNMOWER MAN (2)

This second episode wants to be the end, I mean termination, of the first episode, and both illustrate the fear that was present at the end of the first episode and the possibility to get rid of the danger that virtual reality represents now, because now there is no potential, just danger. In a few years the dominant opinion on virtual reality had changed completely to become a vision of utter destruction for humanity in the hands of all kinds of ambitious social climbers and mentally deranged people. But here the interest is to see where the protection comes from : scientists and engineers, some of them at least, and young people who are otherwise engaged in all kinds of marginal escapistic delinquent activities. The danger is both mental and material. Mental because a new prophet is going to be born thanks to this virtual reality and material because this prophet is going to lead everyone into annihilation. The touching note comes from a dog who is so brilliant that he obeys his master on a TV screen and he can put a CD or CD-Rom in the correct drive and activate it. Touching touchy touchstone, isn't it ?
