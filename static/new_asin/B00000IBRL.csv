1219552,5,B00000IBRL,"ARGENTO, BAVA, AND DE LAURENTIIS, Masters of Horror and Gore, are the driving force behind this film. The film is a TOTALLY AWESOME 1987 HORROR MOVIIE with a sound track including such fab-fav's as THE SMITHS, THE CULT, LOVE AND ROCKETS, PETER MURPHY, AND ART OF NOISE. The cast included such talent as NANNY BRILLI. It was filmed in ROME with a cast and wardrobe that screamed 80's horror flick (NOT SUBTITLED--in ENGLISH).",1484006400,2,424,4.821917808219178

This one is a similar, But it's not a great film  The demon's take over  a high rise building and rampage through it. This is well worth owning though and so is it unofficial sequel ""the church'  ""demons 3 , was not even a real sequel at all , but it's ok.  This one looks good on blu ray and that's a plus.  The music here is also not the great metal of the day. Which if we to be honest if much better than todays metal in many ways , it's instead new wave music!.  Which is good stuff but not as good as what was on the first film. This will entertain you though. It's just not a classic film.",1476576000,,662,3.8666666666666667

1219575,4,B00000IBRL,"I used to love the old movies by Argento, Fulci and the like, and this one I saw before the first Demons.  It's really cheesy Italian 80's horror.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, or you don't like old cheesy horror movies - your loss I guess - then this probably isn't for you.  But if you do, and you haven't already seen it, yeah buddy, check this out.  Beware though, it is absolutely ridiculous.
The blu ray transfer stuff, it looked good and sounded good to me, but I'm not super picky.  Good colors, didn't watch it with a surround system, unfortunately.  If you like the movie and are wondering if you should get it on blu ray, I'd say yes if you don't have it or really want to upgrade your DVD version.",1465430400,3,722,4.233576642335766

1219600,4,B00000IBRL,"Just finished watching this on Amazon Video. Awesome movie. They just don't make them like this anymore. Especially liked the fact that the man and his pregnant girlfriend weren't foolish in how they fought the demons and dealt with the events plaguing them. It did suffer from some predictability issues, but mostly the movie didn't break any of the rules it established for itself (a demon scratching or bleeding on you always led to infction. ) I was little iffy whether or not the pregnant woman would get infected from the little demon hanging onto her, but we never actually see any scratches or bites, so no real problems there. Overall great late night film to watch.",1457654400,,675,4.777777777777778

1219602,4,B00000IBRL,"After seeing the unintentionally brilliant original movie, I knew I had to watch the sequel and I must say that I wasn't disappointed. The movie picks up a year or so after the events of the first after the government has allegedly contained the outbreak from the first. Of course, the containment doesn't last and the demons wreak havoc in a high rise apartment building, forcing a lone and resourceful hero to battle the group of invaders and save his wife. The movie feels like a horror version of Die Hard, which is ironic as this one came out a year before the Bruce Willis classic. Fans of the original will not be disappointed unless they were hoping for a return of the awesome heavy metal soundtrack of the first film as they opted for a more 80's alternative/ New Wave feel.",1450569600,3,784,4.528169014084507

The beginning I admit is creepy and tense and it felt like a really chilling setup for a terrifying movie but the horrendous acting , plot that makes no sense whatsoever, stupid victims and lame ending this movie was a disaster from start to finish.

Highly NOT recommended.

Stick with the first film yes it handsome bad acting /dubbing same as this one did but it was far more interesting , sick, and twisted and the ending was quite sad I didn't see it coming and I should have.",1443657600,,611,4.486486486486487

The transfer on Demons 2 is great!  Not as good as the first Demons (See my review of that Blu-Ray), but still really great!.

1219678,5,B00000IBRL,"While not as great as the first film, Demons 2 is a fantastic piece of 80s horror from Italy. It tells the story of a sixteen year old girl who ditches her own birthday party to watch a horror movie. One of the Demons from the film jumps through her TV (in a Videodrome homage/ripoff) and possesses her. She then kills everyone at her party (and turns them into Demons) who quickly bust out of her apartment after locking down the building.

This is pretty much the exact same movie, but instead of being set in a theater it is set in an apartment building. Once the action starts it doesn't stop. The demon's look pretty cool as well, and the effects are well done. My favorite part of the first movie was it's soundtrack, but this one uses a different type of music.

The acting, for the most part, is over the top, but it fits well with the movie. Their is some really corny dialogue as well.

I'd recommend this to fans of the first movie, and people who are looking for a bloody, violent horror movie.",1420329600,,628,4.26890756302521

this new DEMONS 2 BLU-RAY reissue from synapse films is s*** thou, just barebones

waste of money
if your a big fan of DEMONS 2

and the Audio commentaries, 2 Audio commentaries on the steelbook release
this new DEMONS 2 BLU-RAY has the exact same colour corrected 1:66:1 HD transfer as the Steelbook blu-ray does

1219725,4,B00000IBRL,"This sequel to Lamberto Bava's splatter classic 'Demons' is not in the same league as the original but it does have its moments and still ends up being a lot of fun. The stats above are incorrect. This is the UNCUT 91 minute version and it does have English audio. The 3 minutes added make a lot of difference as this was not considered nearly as gory as the first 'Demons' and now it's given a good boost in this uncensored version. Instead of a movie theater the action takes place in and around a high rise apartment building. Lots of 80s pop music, suspenseful chases scenes, a few genuinely scary moments and some good gore are what you can expect from this one. The image quality looks very good for the most part but some areas (especially in the shadows) do show some artifacts at times, but overall the quality is fine. This series had great potential but they screwed it up with the 3rd one on up (which were never released in the U.S.).

1219745,3,B00000IBRL,"This will be a birthday that Sally will never forget when a new pack of demons is unleashed from the television sets in her high-rise apartment building during her big birthday bash! The tenants and party-goers must fight for their survival before they are ripped to shreds by the ravening ghouls! DEMONS 2 is a structural clone to the original film, following a near-identical plot progression as the demons take over The Tower apartments and possess everyone within their reach. The layout of the building provides plenty of long, dark hallways, elevator shafts, and twisting staircases which allow Lamberto Bava the spooky settings he needs to build his terror and suspense. While it may not be nearly as much fun as the first film, the make-up designs and frights are easily on par with the original. What DEMONS 2 does lack more than anything else is the incredible amount of gore from before that is greatly missed this round. This follow-up is entertaining enough for DEMONS fans, but overall it is a bland retread that rests on a few creepy moments and cheap thrills.

Demoni 1 and 2 were one of my best horror movies ever

i remember when i first watched them, i was like 9 or 10 years old, and i couldn't stop watching them, so i ordered them again from amazon today, if anyone is confused of buying these movies or not, well i recommend them, just don't hesitate, buy them u won't regret it

This is a horror film that does not pretend to be anything other than it is: A cheesy film filled with gore and a lot of in-your-face action. In addition, for those who think this film was any worse than the first film -- whatever. Same story -- just a different setting -- Demons creating more demons. Truth is: This is a highly entertaining Italian film. It is far better than many of the sub-par Italian horror flicks that have graced the silver screen.

That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too.

A cameo I noticed from the first movie, was the black guy that got killed in both movies. What was the use to bring someone back from the previous movie, just to kill them again. Maybe the movie was trying to reach its qouta with the minorities on the cast LOL. I actually like this one better then the first one. I liked how it had built up suspense by showing some of the complex tentants watching the same special on tv about the demons, and all of the tentants come in contact with each other in times of need when the demons went on a blood feast. The birth of the baby was REALLY RAMDOM, and so was the scene that showed sally boyfriend and his friends getting in a wreak with the lil boy's (who left alone in the complex) parents.( He was wayyyy to young to be by himself at late night) It had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEMONS IN THE COMPLEX. I can see if they actually arrived at the complex and became a demon or helped out which would make more sense. I can say NO ONE (or NOTHING lol) WAS SPARED from being turned into a demon. Never the less, this is one of the first movies that scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. The speical effects were damn good for an 80s horror movie.",1162857600,,1320,4.0807692307692305

The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead.

1219775,4,B00000IBRL,"After having cult hit status placed on their awesome horror film Demons, writer-producer Dario Argento and director Lamberto Bava team up again a year later to make Demons 2. This sequel reintroduces the same savage and gory carnage and B-movie sensibilities that were so prevalent in the first Demons. Some of the original actors are also back, if in different roles (for instance, the take-charge pimp in Demons is now a take-charge gym instructor). One negative I noticed right away is that they did away with the hard-hitting heavy metal soundtrack, going instead with a softer rock music selection, to the movie's detriment.

The plot, such as it is:  A documentary covering the last demonic plague is being shown on television. Meanwhile, in an imposing, multi-level apartment structure called The Tower, a birthday party is being held by merry soon-to-be-slashed-and-ripped-victims. Sally, the birthday girl, falls into a snit when she finds out her ex has been invited and goes to her room, where she proceeds to watch the documentary (which is always more fun than partying). In the documentary, four foolhardy teenagers venture into the zoned-off demon territory and inadvertently resurrect a demon. The demon does his unsanitary thing and then somehow turns his attention on Sally, who, at this stage, pretty much has a ""Say, what?"" look on her face. There is a cool-for-its-time f/x as the demon emerges from the TV set and infects Sally, who then does the same favor for her revellers, who soon do the same for the tenants of The Tower (including a gymful of exercisers who get more of a workout than they bargained for), who, in turn, do th-- oh, you get the picture.

This is the kind of movie where no one is safe. You know the extras will get their tickets punched, but most of the featured cast also meet violent, disgusting, Rated R endings. Some of the people you think might pull thru, don't. And vice versa. But part of the fun is in not knowing who makes it thru intact and who gets turned into yummy tasty demon fodder. You try not to get too wrapped up in anyone in the film, because it's hard to invest in a character, only to watch 'em later get disappointingly ripped into raw meat strips and then demonified. Having said that, there is a clear cut hero who makes himself known in the latter stage of the film. I did think, going into this film, that cute dogs were exempt from demon incursions. Color me wrong.

We won't even go into the acting, other than to mention that if you take a cheese grater violently to a B-movie actor, you'll scrape off enough cheese to start your own pizza parlor. Coralina Cataldi Tassoni as the first real-time infectee Sally does gain some minor notoriety. Asia Argento, Dario's daughter, has a small part as a young girl. Hackneyed horror devices run rampant here, such as acidic demon blood eating thru the floors, folks being trapped in confined spaces (elevator), false jeopardy followed speedily by real jeopardy, and even a hokey salute to Alien.  The plot - well, the acidic demon blood must've gotten to the plot, as well. There are several unnecessary scenes shot with Sally's and one little boy's respective parents outside the apartment building, as well as a retread of the original film's useless, going-nowhere scenes of a pack of black, leather-clad hooligans who spend most of the movie driving fast in a car.

So what does that leave? Well, it does leave the one thing that matters most to hard-core horror fans - mindless, gratuitous, graphic scenes of rampaging, dentally-uncouth demons on the attack, various victims undergoing their ghoulish, vein-popping changes, and demons violently getting their comeuppance. Pretty cool also was the backlighted shot of the stalking, glow-eyed demons, which pays homage to that same memorable scene in Demons.

The extra features come with an audio commentary by Director Lamberto Bava, Mechanical Creations & Transformation Artist sergio Stivaletti, and journalist Loris Curci. There are also a theatrical trailer and several talent bios.

The smartest thing I saw in Demons 2 was when the little kid ventured into Sally's apartment, noticed a door slowly opening, and instantly got out of Dodge. Luckily for us horror film consumers, not everyone else in the film showed the same initiative and good sense. Three and a half acidically dripping stars.",1156032000,,4373,4.924016282225238

The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! ""Demons 2"" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original ""Demons"" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!)",1136678400,,644,4.330578512396694
1219780,4,B00000IBRL,"DEMONS was an entertaining gore-fest; DEMONS 2 is much of the same set in an apartment building, but it's still entertaining, very bloody and gory, and downright creepy at times. This film is also quite campy like one reviewer already stated, at times funny, but creepy enough to make it at least memorable.

The story starts with the day of lead character Sally's birthday, and many of her friends have come to help her celebrate her party. Many of the apartments occupants are fixated on a cheesy horror movie where some kids are sneaking into an abandoned city section where the last film took place (I am guessing that's where it is). There's also some actors from the first DEMONS film, Urbano returns as the weight trainer and he's in his usual commanding but silly form, and the security guard in this film was the driver in the car of cocaine addicts in the first film. Both of them ultimately meet a grim fate in the movie. Sally is not a happy camper with her dress for the party, but after hearing her ex is coming to visit her, she runs and locks herself in her room and becomes entranced by the horror movie on tv. In the movie, the demon comes back to life from the girl who cuts her hand and he ultimately is resurrected by her blood. He is kinda creepy but you can tell the performance is campy, too. After he kills off one of the characters, he disappears for some seconds and then comes back and stops for a moment as the narrator tells of the doom sealed by demons on earth, and then something terrible happens. The demon can sense, smell, and see Sally and this is where a cool (for its time in the 80s) effect comes into play...he starts to walk towards the tv and ultimately ends up pushing out of the screen, although you never see him fully emerge, you see him after Sally gets caught off guard when she turns around from smackin' her tv. From there, the mayhem ensues and most of her party-goers are transformed into flesh-ripping demons (you thought I might say zombies, didn't you?) and most of the tenants are turned or slaughtered as well. We also to get to see another mini-demon in this movie, but it was very annoying and it wasn't a very good one (they should have made one like the one in the first movie, but I guess you have to settle for the annoying one). I was glad when it finally got the boot courtesy of an umbrella shoved into it's back. It's up to the hero of the pregnant wife to help get out, and the ending was kind of cheesy but still worked, even if it's not the most classic ending of any horror film.

DEMONS 2, while very similar to DEMONS in both plot and story, is still very entertaining and downright creepy. It's also just as gory too, so you won't be disappointed even if the gore is kind of cartoonish. Beware of the demons!",1129766400,9,2783,4.360308285163777
1219781,5,B00000IBRL,"Do you like carnage? Violence? High Sleaze?

Do you like the prospect of Demons chasing their hapless, screaming victims around in the dark, and tearing off huge chunks of flesh in the process?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, then check out Demons 1 and Demons 2, lovingly gathered together into this tasty deluxe edition.

Italian horror maestro Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava joined forces to produce two of the goriest, most merciless, most stylish, and arguably the best zombie films ever made: for my money, Demons and Demons2 are nectar of the Gods for gorehounds and horror movie fanatics.

Plot, character development, and pacing all take a backseat to the most important element of any zombie movie: brain-eating, bone-crunching, viscera-devouring goodness.

Both of the Demons movies deliver the goods in spades, and have the additional virtue of gorgeous and crisp cinematography, eerie and stylish lighting, and the highest splatter-to-running-time ratio of any horror movie ever made, with the possible exception of Peter Jackson's Dead/Alive.

Best of all, the ""Demons"" movies are utterly merciless: all of the more benevolent horror movie conventions are gleefully abandoned. SEE:

*Dewey-eyed adorable little children get mutated into flesh-devouring demons!

*One of the little demon children explode as it gives 'birth' to a yowling, screaming little imp!

*a fluffy, loyal family dog growl and bark at a pool of demon blood, only to be transformed into an insane and hungry monster, its snout rolling back up over its eyeballs as a new set of green 'eyes' grow out of its nose!

*a blind man get his eyes gouged out even as he begs for the demon to stop!

In short, both movies are sheer horror genius, a 7-course feast (with some nice 1987 Chateau LaTour thrown in) for the discriminating gorehound. It simply doesn't get any better than this, folks, and best of all, you can watch Demons/Demons2 again and again and never get tired of it. Can you honestly say that about ""Night of the Living Dead""?

But let's dispense, quickly, with the plot: there is none.

Alright, I'm being a little glib: there is a plot, but don't expect either film to stick to it. Demons takes place in the Metropol, a haunted (but mysteriously refurbished) Berlin movie theater; patrons gather for a free screening of a new horror movie (about teenagers exploring an ancient cathedral who awaken---you guessed it---demons). One of the moviegoers, Rosemary the Harridan, scratches her cheek on a demonic mask in the lobby; the wound becomes infected (oh boy does it ever!) and begins to bubble and ache.

Rosemary excuses herself, and goes to the bathroom to tend to her now throbbing, pulsating cheek wound, and, after a deliciously gory transformation scene (in which gobbets of flesh, buckets of blood, and waterfalls of pus fly everywhere) becomes a demon.

Rosemary gets out and starts clawing and biting other patrons; people turn into demons; things get out of hand; and after a while Berlin has considerably more to worry about than the Soviets. The second movie offers more of the same, this time in a Berlin apartment building. Both films also inexplicably feature a subplot about a carload of ill-tempered punk rockers who spend roughly 75% of the film driving aimlessly around Berlin listening to new wave ditties, but don't worry---they get theirs. Oh yes indeed.

Both movies feature the aforementioned gobs of gore, stunning demon transformation scenes, and hip eighties soundtracks (featuring Motley Crue, Billy Idol, Dead Can Dance and The Cult). You get to see Berlin in all its old Cold War glory. And best of all, you have the sheer delight of two of the most shockingly gory zombie flicks ever put to film on a sleek, gorgeous DVD transfer!

Some have complained the acting in the film is atrocious, but what do you expect from a film which was originally shot in German and Italian, and then dubbed over into English---and not using good, expressive English voices, but folks who sound like their acting skills are sub-par, at best. Look, you can't have it all---and anyway, you get the winsome Fiore Argento in Demons and the tasty and plummish Asia Argento in Demons2 (Dario's daughters). Something this enjoyable shouldn't be legal, so take advantage of Demons/Demons2 while you can.

Firstly, it's almost a remake rather than a sequel, with TV sets instead of a cinema acting as the entrance point for the demons. The apocalyptic ending to the first movie apperas to have come and gone, and barely raises a ripple here, as people in a huge apartment block settle down to a TV movie showing the same hideous demons going about their business. Before you know it, monsters are squeezing throught the TV sets and taking possession of innocent residents!
The film has one great set piece in which the first victim of demon possession undergoes a hideous transofrmation in the middle of her own birthday party and proceeds to tear all the guests to shreds. There is real tension in this scene as her pals sing happy birthday to her, unaware that she is about to ge beserk! Sadly, it's horror-by-numbers all the rest of the way, as adults, children and pet dogs all get the demon take-over treatment. The film just strings gory encounters together, and it even duplicates the original with the arrival of a gang of thugs in a speeding car. To be blunt, it all just really goes nowhere, albeit at high speed. Plus there's huge plot holes everywhere, especially in the many daft reasons put in place as to why people can't get out of the building (and what the hell is going on with that TV studio at the end?). Still, you won't be bored watching Demons 2, but then again, you probably won't be scared either.",1078099200,,1610,4.479591836734694
1219829,2,B00000IBRL,"The original ""Demons"" was a hodge-podge of senseless violence and gore galore. The sequel is pretty much the exact same thing only with a few minor improvements.

This time around the action takes place in a bullet-proof building. A spoiled woman with bad fashion sense (keep in mind this film was made in the 80's) sits in front of her television unit watching a movie (or documentary) about demons. A demon then comes out of her television set (""Videodrome"" style) and possesses her and I think you can guess the rest; more of the same brainlessness of the original with slime and blood to boot. ""Demons 2"" does have a couple of highlights; for curiosity seekers, the film stars a very young Asia Argento. Many of her current fans may not even recognize her considering she's a young girl here, several years before her sex-pot roles and image. The films demon make-up is also pretty impressive and it does offer a few sudden surprises. However it still has it's bad moments which cannot be ignored and a couple of scenes are laughable. There is a scene involving a poor infected dog who transforms into a demon dog with glowing eyes. Interesting idea? No, not really since the demon dog looked as convincing and as realistic as Pamela Anderson's breast implants. Worse is the scene where a miniature demon claws its way out of a poor child's chest. Both of these ideas would have worked had they put more care into it. They didn't. The latter miniature monster looks like a minion pulled right out of ""Ghoulies 2"".

Many have called the ""Demons"" series ""guilty pleasures"" and ""brainless fun"". I prefer to just call them ""brainless"". Unless of course, wasting 90 minutes of your life watching junk like this is what you consider fun. It is better than the original, but not by much.",1068336000,,1784,4.696485623003195

These are films about monsters running amuck and slicing people into potato salad.  Abandon any kind of expectations for these films and go with it.  As you know, Demons has people trapped in a movie theater with creepy, taloned, fanged, greenish creatures.  There is absolutely no explanation given for this event.  You never discover who made this film(the film playing in the theater), who's showing it, why they're showing it, how the entrances get blocked off, how the mask ends up in the lobby, etc.  But who cares anyway?  There are tons of things that don't make sense-people turn into Demons without actually getting scratched, a mini-Demon hops out of somebody.  None of these things make sense, but the movie's fun to watch either way.
Demons 2 is basically a remake, but the setting is now switched to an apartment complex.  Everyone seems to be watching this film about the events of the first Demons film.  This film seems to be a documentary, then it seems to be an actual movie, then the events seem to actually be taking place in the real world in some other location.  There is no camera crew with the people in the ""documentary"", and Bava films their little adventure as though it's actually happening-But it's supposed to be being viewed by the people in the apartment!!

These films seemed much scarier to me when I was a kid(I didn't understand the concept of bad dubbing, acting, writing, etc.  I was just creeped out by the Demons), but I still love them.  I've always been intrigued by the Romero-ish situation of being stuck inside a building, fighting for your life against horrible creatures.  The difference between these and Romero's films is that the threat isn't waiting outside, it's trapped in there with you!  I think that's why I like these so much.

1219878,3,B00000IBRL,"I'm reviewing Demons and Demons 2 (aka Demoni and Demoni 2) together because they are very similar movies made a year apart by mostly the same people. They were written by legendary director and writer Dario Argento along with Lamberto Bava, the son of the late, great director Mario Bava. Dario also produced both movies and Lamberto directed both movies. They were both filmed in Italy and made to look like an American city. They were both filmed in English with decent dubbing for the most part. They both very much celebrate the 80's both in music and fashion. And they are both very gory with lots of blood, and splatter.
Demons starts out with a strange man with a partial mask made out of metal riding around on roller skates passing out invitations to a horror movie at the reopening of some old theater. At the start of the movie the theater is about half full and the story on the screen is about teenagers who discover some old graveyard and a mask that turns one of them into zombies which starts the whole ""If you get bitten by a zombie you turn into a zombie"" thing. A girl attending the movie with a friend and their bald headed pimpish/he-man/studley-man type date is in the lobby and tries on a mask that is part of a lobby promotional prop for the film. She gets pricked by something sharp in the mask and it draws a little blood. After they sit down she notices some blood on her cheek and goes to the bathroom to clean up. In the bathroom she changes into a zombie and this starts the whole chain. After awhile there are zombies running around everywhere and the non-zombies left in the theater are trapped because the doors are inexplicably chained shut. Since there is no escape they have to resort to fighting and of course it is just a matter of time before they are slowly picked off. At one point towards the end some zombies make it outside and while we don't see it, a whole apocalypse type zombie movement starts in the city. The few characters that make it out of the theater alive get in a jeep and are headed for the hills away from the zombies.
In Demons 2, the setting is in a high rise apartment building and instead of the zombie movie being shown on a screen, it is being shown on the television. There are several different character plots occurring at the same time with the common theme that they all have a zombie movie playing on the TV. Somehow a demon comes out of the TV and starts to wreak havoc. Once again, before too long, the non-zombie people are grouped together and fighting for their lives. Asia Argento makes her first movie appearance in Demons 2 as a little girl fascinated by the zombie movie. This film does branch out a little bit from the first in that the demons have taken over a TV studio and are somehow transmitting their zombieness over the airwaves. Hey, it could happen! There was a little more money for Demons 2 and it shows in the makeup. While the first movie was a little more disgusting, this one has slightly better effects.
One of the funnest parts (or most painful depending on viewpoint) is the 80's music and styles in both films. Dead Can Dance, Billy Idol, Motley Crue, Rick Springfield and other make the soundtrack seem like a Time/Life 80's disk. The bright pastels and skinny ties worn by the actors also give it a very 80's look.
You can buy the movies separately or as part of the Anchor Bay's 2 disk set ""Dario Argento Collection 2: Demons / Demons 2"". This is the copy I owned (but sold on ebay) and has a commentary by director Dario Argento, special effects make-up effects artist Sergio Stivaletti, music composer Claudio Simonetti and journalist Loris Curci. There is also a behind the scenes segment and trailers. Both films are displayed in 1.66:1 and look and sound great.",1034380800,2,3770,4.489082969432315
1219879,5,B00000IBRL,"This is one of my favorite horror films of all-time.  I'm not a horror expert like others, but I enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed Jackson's DEAD ALIVE, Raimi's EVIL DEAD, Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD, and more than say...Fulci's THE BEYOND.  Why?
*It's got great gross-out effects(man-made gore, none of that 'clean'-looking cgi gore), esp. the human-to-demon transformation scenes.
*It's fast-paced with good action. These demons move fast and are quick.  After seeing this you won't feel sorry for hapless victims who can't outrun slow zombies or who are so clumsy that they bump into them.
*It has a sense of style.  Visually impressive, with the movie-within-a-movie scenes and the part where the demons run in slo-mo down a hall with eyes glowing being standouts!
*Great music.  Excellent Italian new wave electronic score opens and closes the credit sequences in the first film.  80's songs(these being 80's films) are present throughout both films and are a mixed bag(#2 ends with 'Rain' from the Cult...which is good).
True, the dubbing is bad, but if you dub SEVEN SAMURAI, SEVENTH SEAL,  and CITIZEN CANE badly, they aren't gonna come across as great either.  Besides, are you watching these expecting to see those types of films?  Overall, if you liked one you'll like the other, but admittedly it will be a case of seen-that, been-there.  But at least make it a priority to see the first.  Plus, a few extras with a nice image transfer make this dvd a must buy(or at least a must see), esp. for those looking for an antidote to all those teen/cgi-fx/hollywood-type horror films.  Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a blast, get grossed out, and even scared...and that's what it's all about right?",1022803200,6,1717,4.86254295532646
1219880,5,B00000IBRL,"Personally, I've been very impressed with the Dario Argento Collections and have gone out of my way to pick them all up. Normally I wouldn't go for the combination packaging because I fear lower quality discs and an overall cheapening of the packaging, but these releases have been an exception to that rule. Anchor Bay has done a great job giving you a nice case and inserts depicting the original release art. Besides, I honestly love these two movies and was glad to see them combined into one very effective combo, allowing me to watch both Demons and its predecessor back to back. Now, I have something to play when my friends are around and we want to see some gore with our possession and still have a little bit of fun in the ""somewhere in-between."" Having Argento and Bava at my fingertips is a wonderful thing, indeed. To the movies:
Demons is a tale of some poor, unfortunate souls that thought accepting free screening passes to the movies was a good idea. The characters, a hodgepodge of people simply waiting in line for a wonderful, high bodycount gorefest, seem to change their minds, however, when things begin to go awry in the most horrible of fashions. While in line, a ""lady of the night"" waiting to watch the movie picks up a mask that looks very much like the face of a demon and puts it on. In the process of removing it, she finds herself scratched on the cheek. Well, when the movie they are watching shows a scene with one of its characters also experiencing this same mask/scratching effect, the beautiful wonderland of possession shows itself in all its graphic wonder.
The demons in the story looks good, the effects are nicely done, and the setting is completely off-balancing. Its a five star plus.
Demons 2 isn't as serious about its horror as the last movie, as the review on the back of the packaging implies. To quote it, ""The nightmare returns when the residents of an apartment complex must battle an onslaught of crazed zombies."" Now, while I don't call getting possessed becoming a Zombie, I do call this a great movie that still has gore, a more humorous approach than the first, and is still close to a five star piece for anyone who likes sequels. There are droves of people to feed to the dying machine, and the hopelessness the first movie captured is still there, possessing those unfortunate enough to cross its path.
As the movie said, ""They will make cemeteries their cathedrals and the cities their tombs!"" Now if that doesn't say cute and cuddly, what does?",1021766400,,2508,4.638202247191011
1219881,2,B00000IBRL,"Review of Demons
A group of people stuck in a big movie theater have to take on hideous demons.  Very popular Italian gorefest has some really excellent make-up effects and a fun premise, but it's just not entertaining.  The lighting's too dark, the action is confusingly filmed, and the story keeps cutting back to a useless subplot about a coke-snorting gang!  Props to the lead actor, though, who looks like a cross between Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Dolph Lundgren!  Stick with Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead or Night of the Demons for a much scarier rollercoaster ride with a similar premise.

This movie is an exercise in banality and I can guarantee that your IQ will drop a minimum of 10 points before it's all over.

Would anyone in his right mind even consider going to a place being promoted by a weirdo that originally inspired terror in the heart of the ""star""?

1219906,4,B00000IBRL,"When I was about twelve years old my brother and I snuck into Demons at our local theater. This movie scared me really bad when I was young and after watching it agian I can see why. Demons is a good film that is loaded with blood, gore and shock. This was produced by Dario Argento an Italian director who worked with George A Ramero on Dawn of the Dead...
 The movie is about a movie theater that re-opens and has a free screening. Once at the theater the people there see that it's a horror movie and settle in for a good ride. A prostitute puts on a mask in the lobby and cut's her face, somthing that happens to one of the people in the movie, and once he turn's into a Demon so does she. From there all hell breaks loose. Literally.
This was a well made horror film. It also is a bit of a surprise to me becouse I am not a big fan of the Italian horror scene. The make-up and monster effects are very convincing and scary. Unlike some horror movie's (Zombie, City of the living dead, and Don't go into the woods etc) the movie's monster's are very effective. There are a few scenes of shlock but the movie is such a nice surprise that you can look past all of that.
 I should not have to tell you that you will not get the same effect watching this movie at home as in the movie theater but it is still a scary film to watch. Just be warned this is a groy, graphic, violent film that is un-rated for a reason.
 Demons 2 was a good follow up but not nearly as good as the first. 2 deals with an apartment highrise and a party. I personally think the makers of 2 realized that most people would see this movie at there home and not at the theater so they made it more for the vhs/dvd viewer in mind. I gave the movies 4 stars becouse the first movie get's 5 and the second 2.
 A quick side note. While my brother and I were in the theater he met some firends of his. We all dicided to watch the movie together. At the end of the film one of his friend got a nose bleed and to this day I have no idea how I kept from running, scearming from the theater.",1016323200,7,2056,3.983009708737864

Even The Evil Dead paused now and again between the dismemberings. Bava tries to set the scene for the first twenty minutes, then abandons all sense of logic to ensure you stay on the edge of your seat with 70 minutes of superbly edited mayhem helped immensely by Sergio Stivaletti's slimy special effects and Claudio Simonetti's eerie, gurgling, pounding synthesisers.
This is an example of Italian horror cinema at it's most frenzied, confusing, laughable, exhilarating, loud, intense, stylish and horrific.

I will admit it's a bit better (my actual rating for this movie is 2 and a half) but it should not have been made in the first place but that's show biz. The story is about a 16 year old named Sally (Coralina Cataldi Tassoni) who is having a sweet sixteen party but when she takes a break from her party to watch TV a demon from a documentery about what happened in the first DEMONS comes out of the TV and possess her and the rest of the movie which is set in a glass high-rise apartment building (with bullet proof glass)is basically demons gobbling up the people in the building. The movie still has a lot of gore and blood but unlike the first DEMONS there is not a huge abundance of it. Thank goodness. And the characters in the script are not as dumb as the ones in the first DEMONS though don't misunderstand me, it's still a poor script.

1219912,2,B00000IBRL,"This review is in regard to the first of the two DEMONS movies (I am in the process of seeing part 2). My reason for seeing DEMONS was because Dario Argento was producer and i've come to expect good stuff from him as a director and Claudio Simonetti of the rock group Goblin does the music. I have never seen his other work but Lamberto Bava seems to have garnered much acclaim for his work on films like MACABRE so when fans of him and Dario first saw this they claimed this wasn't what they expected from L. Bava. Especially someone who's father, Mario Bava, was so talented. Looks like he did not get as much talent as he should have from dad. The short and dumb plot is about two girls who recieve complimentery tickets to a secret movie screening. At the screening demons jump out from the movie and posses memebers of the audience and the surviving members try to escape. The movie features graphic gore and violence and it is so filled with it that you will eventually feel numb toward it. The characters are dumb stereotypes (...) The guys act all big and strong and the girls run around screaming and yelling to their guys to do something. In an age where women like Neve Campbell are the heroes this will not go well with some people. And let's not forget the bad acting. Pretty much everybody in here acts like the only acting experience they ever had was in their 5th grade school play (as a footnote one of Dario Argento's daughters, Fiore Argento, appears in the movie. Asia Argento appears in the sequel.) So if your by yourself get ready for a tedious and braindead movie. But this movie is actually somewhat enjoyable if you bring a couple of friends over to see it.

1219998,2,B00000IBRL,"Dario Argento Presents: Demons 2: The Nightmare Is Back (Lamberto Bava, 1986)
When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissable. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early Helen Mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) As well, Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror subgenre known as Giallo (he's the son of Mario Bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties B-horror films. So how bad can this be, right?
Well, bad. The demons continue their assault on Italian media, as the movie opens in a modern Italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. They're all watching a kind of combination news report/mateur video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the timeframe of this one no more than a few days after the first film). Through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the TV screen to start the plague anew.
Yeah. It's that bad. About the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is stunning. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who got his start as a part of the Argento Dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as Lord of Illusions and Hackers.
Makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily, but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp, Shivers (aka They Came From Within), is a whole lot better. **",977443200,2,2398,4.725536992840095

Talk about  the worst parts of the 1980's.  The story takes place in a high tech  apartment building in Germany.  It introduces a variety of characters, from  a pregnant woman and her husband, a teenager and her New Wave party, and a  bunch of ""staying alive"" refugees and throws a bunch of demons at  them.
The way the Demon's appear is totally ridiculous and nearly  de-rails the movie.  A kid is watching a horror movie (which is better than  the actual movie) and a demon from the movie ""breaks"" thru the  picture tube into real life.  If this is the case, how come the demon  doesn't appear in all other houses?  How come the European version of the  MPAA doesn't figure this out?
The special effects are fairly good for the  budget that is put into it.  It also has a decent ""New Wave""  soundtrack including The Smiths.  However, it enforces my theory that  1980's white people can't dance to save their lives.

Its only a matter of time until the demons make their way our of the television and begin to terrorize the residents of a high end apartment building. Demons 2 is a blast of a sequel and is again filled with great demon makeup and special effects. The British new wave soundtrack works great, for the hip and sophisticated characters of Demons 2.

The Synapse Blu Ray has fantastic video and audio quality. The only extra is the original U.S. theatrical trailer. Very highly recommended to horror fans, and a must see if you loved the first Demons.",1504483200,,848,4.5064935064935066
