8120672,3,B000FC2FWY,"Specifically regarding Passport to Danger DVD released by Critic's Choice. Four episodes from the mid-1950s television series starring Cesar Romero as Steve McQuinn, a U.S. State Department diplomatic courier who finds trouble, intrique and gorgeous girls in every city of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

This was a big-budget series and each episode features many locations and a slick script. I like Michael Rennie in the Third Man better than Cesar Romero but this is a well-produced program and entertaining.

This so-called Volume 1 of only 1 volumes features episodes titled: Geneva; Rome; Tangiers; and, Turkey. These episodes are included in releases by other companies but are better than the same episodes in the two-disc collection from Timeless Media.

Considering this is sold on Amazon for less than $2 plus shipping, you will not be disappointed. However, Passport to Danger is best-suited for fans of 1950s television or those who remember Cesar Romero. If you like Passport to Danger, you will like the Third Man and also Dangerous Assignment.",1216080000,,1071,5.251461988304094
