The first kill was pretty good and led to so much potential. The girls were fun to watch and should be cast in anther film. I usually don't care about actors and actresses in horror movies but these girls worked well together. The cook couldn't speak english and only could utter ok, which got annoying. The Cook eventually kills everyone in the house and moves on to anther college house.

Overall, a fast paced movie with some good kills and gore. The cook got annoying after awhile and the ending was plain dull. I cannot imagine anther film with this guy. I recommend it because it's worth a look.",1253491200,,748,4.45985401459854

But I give it three stars for one reason and one reason only, and that's the part where aggressive lesbian sorority girl Anastasia (Penny Drake) pursues pretty blonde freshman Kristen (Brooke Lenzi).  Those two were hot together!

Kristen is afraid of Anastasia, but after the older girl kisses her passionately she allows herself to become Anastasia's ""property"" for the night, with the dominant brunette they tying her up while she playfully spanks and kisses her beautiful body!  I would really have enjoyed an entire film revolving around these two pretty women together!

Sadly, Anastasia decides to go downstairs to the kitchen for some chocolate sauce to lick off of Kristen's gorgeous body, and when she does so she's predictably killed by the cook, and the film gets completely uninteresting from that point on.  (Not that it was particularly great beforehand, aside from the two aforementioned hotties!)

The Cook is is a very funny, well written little bloodfest with emphasis on the funny over the horrific.

There is plenty of blood, just the right amount of chubb inducing naked girls and some great dialogue from the potty mouthed pothead. There were never any sorority girls like these in my college...and I went to SDSU!

Nothing beats watching a bible thumping hottie get seduced by the by the house lezbo. For once I was not even interested in the kills so much as what would come out of these girls mouths.

3104573,3,B0013D8M08,"""The Cook"" is another in the recent crop of horror-comedies that, like so many of its brethren, fails to live up to its hype.  Even graded on the b-movie curve this story only rates a 2.5 (rounded up to 3 for ridiculous amounts of prurient behavior and some decent fan-boy humor.)

The story takes place in a sorority house (and thus begins our exploitation potential), where the girls who didn't go ""away"" on spring break are planning on carousing their way through the long weekend.  Please note, I'm not entirely sure if the decision to ""carouse"" without any (well nearly any) participation by the opposite sex was done for budgetary or ""exploitive reasons, but the fact that the Sorority is ""Lambda Epsilon Zeta"" tends to make me think the latter.

As an added twist, our killer is the Sorority's new cook.  Who has just arrived from Hungary and speaks ""very"" little English.  His motif is not hockey masks or a clawed glove, no this serial killer goes for cannibalism in a ""culinary"" sort of way and then feeding the ""remains"" of his kills to his future victims.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I mean hey, it's full of pretty young things.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  It has a geeky love story and a ""fall from innocence"" (sort of) subplot going on and the ads promise nudity and gore.  What more could a low brow horror movie fan ask for?

Well, for starters he could ask for the actual delivery of some more of the nudity, but that's actually a fairly minor point.  By the very act of watching a movie like this, the viewer agrees to suspend disbelief, up to a point.  I can tolerate (enjoy?) a cannibalistic serial killer who just happens to wind-up in a Sorority House full of improbably beautiful and hedonistic coeds.  But I'd like a little internal consistency to my story.  I have some real problems with a Sorority House where the acoustics allow for the inhabitants to hear raised voices one minute, but not the tortured screams of the killer's victims the next minute (especially when the murder is supposed to be happening right down the hall.)  Ditto, after about the second meal where the ""perpetually dieting"" thin coeds don't complain, or even comment on the fact, that the cook is serving them all ""heavy"" meat based meals all the time, my suspension of disbelief begins to wear.  But, where the movie really suffers (as so many of them do) is when the writer tries to fill in the time leading up to the killings with dialogue; and does so in an incredibly painfully incompetent manner.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for Quentin Tarantino level dialogue.  I'm asking for ""don't make me cringe"" level dialogue.

All in all, the production values were good, the concept was entertaining (campy), the kills delivered large quantities of gore, and the actresses were easy on the eyes.  If all you want is some fan-boy humor, rated PG-13/R eye candy, and your eighties style slasher movie fix, this might be the movie for you.",1207785600,8,2968,4.656429942418426

8250315,5,B0013D8M08,"Like most ""serious"" horror fans (what does that even mean) I tend to be leery of certain things: a) teenagers (by which I mean basically up to age 25)  going on camping trips, b) teenagers going on road trips, c) teenagers going on foreign trips, d) found footage, e) haunted houses, f) cheerleaders, g) sororities.
But give a think to ""g)"". Didn't the whole slasher genre begin with the awesome sorority massacre film Black Christmas? (It did, it did! You're so smart Mr. Amazon Critic. Here's our collective number. By the way, we're all cute girls.) Maybe that's why the sorority house as a setting has gone so far off the reservation. Because trust me, I look through Amazon Instant Video titles every day, there's LOTS of sorority house horror fare out there (& also a disturbing amount of women's prison stuff, but don't get me started...) Perhaps it's just that it lends itself way too easily to the lotion-and-tissue crowd.* Or maybe it's just that sororities are kind of lame.
But pay attention to this wonderful entre served up by director Gregg Simon and writers Nicholas Bonomo, Francisco Rodriguez and Dirk Van Fleet. All guys, am I right? What gives?  Actually, if you're looking for signs of the progress of feminism in the film industry by examining  a sorority slasher, you may have taken a wrong term somewhere.
In all seriousness, I really would like to see a good one of these come from an all double-X team, but I would be willing to bet that there's a lot of insider knowledge at play here, from the women in the crew, in the cast, the writers' families. Maybe I'm wrong, having never astrally traveled to a sorority house (hint hint, God. Birthday coming soon) but this felt real. One way or another, the eight women (a lot for a slasher!) in the cast all seemed like consenting adults, and seemed to be having a very good time with it.
Yes, l&t crowd, there's LOADS of nudity here, and a great deal of lesbianism to boot. What I found remarkable was how hard it was to guess who would be the winner of the inevitable and enviable title ""Last Girl Standing."" For a while I was tempted to bet for a double win by inveterate dom lesbian Anastasia (Penny Drake) and her good-Christian-girl-to-willing-lesbian-bondage-slave-in-under-60-seconds girlfriend (I think it's Kristen, played by Brooke Lenzi); or for the delightfully ditzy Bunny (Kit Paquin), who first scorn nerdy man-boy math tutor Lance (Allen Yates), but finally falls for him and seems to have the time of her life, in a gratifying scene that I'm sure has happened eventually to quite a few nerdy guys out there; but in the end I doubled down on beautifully bespectacled Makkinna Ridgway as Amy. I'll let you discover whether I made the right choice.
This is a movie that challenges you to write it off as dumb fluff before you even watch it.  Don't fall for the trap!

I went to Walmart and read the back, and it sounded like a really good movie.  I didn't agree with the price and knew I could find it cheaper on amazon, so I ordered it.  I have to say, this movie is great.  Its brutally disgusting, yet fun and entertaining.  The cook comes off as a foreign chef that knows no english and says things like ""I AM COOK!  OKAY!""  and its hilarious.  But, one by one he is killing the sorority sisters and FEEDING them to the others!
