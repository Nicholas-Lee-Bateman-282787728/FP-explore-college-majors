836208,5,6304293518,"During the Golden Age Of Television, there were many wonderful dramas that were not afraid to showcase ethnicity. Dramas such as ""The Tenth Man"", and""The World Of Shalom Aleichem"" showed universal  truths. Here you can see a preview of Zero Mostel in his environment, long  before his emmy winning ""Fiddler On The Roof."" Here, Jack Gilford  performs his wonderful pantomine soon to be used for Cracker Jack  commercials. The three stories show the depth of Aleichem's humor; the wise  foolishness of Chelm; the sarcastic tale of the meek inheriting the earth,  and the poignant tale of quotas in education which existed in the 1950's  and 1960's.  Besides, I had a chance in high school to play ""Bontche  Schweig"", and seeing the master at work is a dream come true.
Don't  miss out on this one.",954720000,14,795,4.822222222222222

What started as interest in the back story of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" lead to this marvelous trip through the life and times of Sholom Aleichem and also history lessons we should never forget.",1392940800,,250,4.681818181818182
7867341,4,6304293518,"Zero Mostel's name is sure to sell, but his role is not as large in old film that was thankfully saved.  He was not the comic Tevye, but a true member of the ensemble of Yiddish players, all of whom were excellent.  Frankly, The tale of ""Bontche Shveig"" by I.A.L. Peretz lost its impact by showing actors.  I have a recording In which Jack Gilford plays Bontche; by listening and creating the scenes in my head, I was reduced to tears.  This did not touch me.  The last and longest video ""The High School"" was by far the best.

7867346,5,6304293518,"The excellent review previously posted by KGHarris gives you a lot of information about this DVD release but I wanted to supplement it with additional info and my take on the DVD.

As noted, this was one episode of the ""Play of The Week Series"" that David Suskind produced for ""Independent"" NY TV station WNTA. It only lasted 2 years because this was before ""Public Broadcasting"", as we know it. When WNTA became non-commercial (the DVD has the show with commercials excised), the show was too expensive to produce.

The play itself was produced off-Broadway as a way to employ many Blacklisted actors. Some of the original cast - Jack Gilford, Lee Grant, among them - from that cast are in this TV production. And, it's important to remember that this show aired five years before the Broadway smash ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (based on characters from Aleichem's stories) was produced. Watching Zero Mostel (the only actor to appear in all three stories on this DVD), in the first story, you know that non one else could have created the role of Tevye in FOTR.

The first story is funny and clever. The second is a tribute to Jack Gilford's (who later worked with Mostel in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"") use of facial expressions. The third, about quotas in high schools, was on the cusp of the civil rights and school integration movement. And Gertrude Berg shows us her Molly Goldberg persona at its best.

There are some weaknesses here: The print shows a good bit of wear and dust during the first three minutes - and, periodically, later in the show. I'm not sure if this was restored, as were other Archive of American TV releases like the superb ""Evening Primrose"". But it is certainly watchable. While all the cast is first rate, I do question casting the role of the 15 year old boy in the ""High School"" story with an actor clearly in his mid 20s. But these are not enough for me to drop a star.

The enclosed 12 page booklet of essays is an integral part of the enjoyment of this DVD and is welcomed.

Just a small observation as I watched the credits roll at the end of the show. Many great directors got their start in television dramas in the 1950s. You'll note one ""Robert Rafelson"" as the ""Script Editor"". This, I am certain, is Bob Rafelson who - along with Jack Nicholson - wrote and directed the classic ""Five Easy Pieces""!

I've watched - and reviewed - nearly all the Academy of American Television releases and love them. This is a part of broadcast history that needs to be preserved.

7867348,5,6304293518,"What a gentle and charming film! Amazing.  This film includes three short stories done in the style of the Yiddish theatre at the turn of the century.  Today when we are used to extraordinary special effects, virtual reality, digitally enhanced images, the simple props of the Yiddish Theatre

bring back a world lost to time.  The first story is about a

Jewish fool played by Zero Mostel who repeatedly gets tricked when he goes out to buy food provisions for the family.  He

needs to bring back a she goat but (behind his back), this is

turned into a he goat that does not deliver milk.  Zero Mostel

turns in a wonderful performance as he dances through the story with that wonderful love of life peculiar to the Jewish life of the shtetl.  The second story is a fable about an unfortunate

poor man who never complains to God about his miserable lot on earth. For his stoic attitude, he is greeted in heaven as a saint worthy of Moses, superior to Job - who did complain!

The last story is the most interesting.  It concerns a husband and wife who struggle to get their intelligent son into a

Russian high school when the authorities routinely restrict the

number of Jews who are admitted. Delightfully acted.  For those

who can't get enough of ""Fidder on the Roof"", this is the movie for you.",1131062400,,1304,4.523605150214593
