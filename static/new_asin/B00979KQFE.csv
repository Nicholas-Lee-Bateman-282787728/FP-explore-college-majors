5276412,1,B00979KQFE,"MISSING IN ACTION and MISSING IN ACTION: THE BEGINNING

Just in time for his big screen comeback, these two Chuck Norris favorites arrive on blu-ray disc. Coming from the less than believed producers Golan-Globus, the Cannon logo never looked more gloriously cheesy than it does in high definition, these 80's ""gems"" are a part of the whole lets go back and win the Vietnam conflict wish fulfillment fantasies of the Reagan/Bush era. On that scale of things, these two pictures come on the short end, not living up to the high mark leveled by Sly Stallone with Rambo: First Blood Part II or Gene Hackman and his all-star crew in the much needed on blu-ray Uncommon Valor.

As it is, these are the film the legend that is Chuck Norris is probably best known for. The first picture is by far the better of the two, which producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus knew, because actually these two pictures where shot in reverse order, but once the mini-moguls saw the flicks, they new that they had one turkey and one half way decent programmer on their hands.

 Here starring as Col. James Braddock, the role he was born to play, Chuck leads a rescue mission for MIAs still kept prisoner in Vietnam years after the war. Aided by a bullet proof raft, a never ending supply of ammo and a better than this movie deserves partner in character actor M. Emmet Walsh. This works pretty nicely as guilty pleasure escapist entertainment that still holds up fairly well. Hear the Chucksaurus roar.

MIA 2 on the other hand is whole different beast. Cheap and shoddy looking, it feels like a real bad TV episode from the era. With Chuck easily out acting, yes you read that right, most of the rest of the cast. This movie is just a sloppy, silly mess with a storyline so absurd that it almost has to be seen to be believed. Although, it must be said that at times the flick goes so far over the edge as to be comically, making it often so bad that it is funny,. A twice over infinity of internet jokes were born right here.",1346630400,,2009,4.478142076502732
5276413,2,B00979KQFE,"I must say big fan of the Missing in action series. As for the blu ray release of the first two movies i will say the picture quality is not bad i honestly don't expect much from these movies based on there age and the quality that it was filmed. I will say it looks great on my hd tv. I only have one complain and that is the audio quality, really mono dts you have to be joking me i at least got stereo on the dvd release of this movie come on you use a 50gb blu ray disc don't tell me you couldn't even add stereo. just on the audio alone is why i rate it 2 stars. if you are a big chuck norris fan or just like missing in action i cant blame you for wanting to get this on blu ray. I will just like to hope one day they release this movie with better quality audio.",1344556800,,769,3.723926380368098

Distributor: MGM Video (US)

Kicking off the Chuck Norris Blu-ray archives comes the Vietnam war saga Missing in Action. The film along with its two sequels presents the story of one Col. James Braddock who returns to Saigon years after the war has been officially declared over, in the hunt for POWs still rumoured to be held behind former enemy lines.

With classic Chuck Norris movies you kind of know what you are in for from the very beginning and these two are certainly no different. Packed full of the usual over the top action sequences (only this time within an extensive jungle setting) the films deliver a pretty entertaining ride thanks in part to fairly decent production values courtesy of Canon Video. The second film in the series is actually filmed as a prequel to the first showcasing the backstory of life inside the POW camp, years before Braddock would eventually break out and return to seek vengeance and a few minor continuity issues aside, flows together rather well with Norris delivering the usual one man army approach to anything that gets in his way.

Making their region free Blu-ray debut as Walmart exclusives, both movies are presented with 1080p 1:85:1 transfers which look surprisingly good. Detail is impressive, colours are vibrant and black levels appear deep and well defined. Considering the previous budget DVD releases these films have seen, the new Blu-ray transfers will surely please collectors everywhere as the films themselves have never looked better and in a direct comparison to the DVD prints simply blows away the competition.

Audio is presented with an English DTS HD Mono track which although won't do anything at all for your surround speakers, actually fairs much better than might have been expected with spoken dialogue remaining clear and free from distortion and the many action sequences coming across as reasonably prominent throughout both films.

Sadly however the extra features look like they have been roundhouse kicked straight off the discs as there are none to speak of apart from the obligatory theatrical trailers. Any other potential extras would appear to be as much missing in action as some of Chucks POW friends back in Vietnam and you can't help but wonder just how hard it would have been to obtain some interview footage to make even a mini documentary, especially considering the following these films have. Unfortunately once again, this wasn't to be.

All things considered, the improvements in transfer and audio quality alone easily justifies a purchase especially if you are a classic 80's movie collector. If you really want to go all out on the full series, Missing in Action III has just been announced for Blu-ray release later this year in Germany so the James Braddock story can soon be complete.

With a decent selection of these 80's classics now seeing Blu-ray release and many more already signed up, collectors will soon be spoiled for choice with many of their favourite movie memories now appearing fresher than ever before. The Missing in Action series make a pretty decent start to the Canon collection, especially with their much improved HD transfers which only enhance the nostalgia factor ten fold. Hopefully further volumes in this series will continue to provide high quality presentations although a few extras would certainly be most welcome.

So overall a strong beginning to the Chuck Norris Blu-ray library and what better way to enjoy some classic over the top senseless action from the master himself? After all when Canon studios and Chuck Norris came together you just knew those bad guys were about to have a very bad day.

5276415,3,B00979KQFE,"The bluray edition has very good video & audio quality.  I can't say the video is outstanding, but certainly looks GREAT for an old 1980's film.  I don't know if it was remastered or not.  Of the three new Chuck Norris bluray releases, I'd say Missing in Action (the first one), has the best image quality.  The opening scene, with the camera moving through the jungle, prepares you for how good the film is going to look.  Overall, I'm very pleased.  There aren't any extras, unfortunately.  The video quality of The Delta Force is good, but colors appear to be a tad oversaturated.  I was worried about how much effort a Walmart-produced trasnfer would look, but ultimately it does not disappoint.  If you're a fan, you can't go wrong to purchase the bluray, which is a steal at under $10.",1339632000,,791,4.5928571428571425

8537314,1,B00979KQFE,"Chuck Norris returns, or rather begins, as Colonel James Braddock in the prequel to last year's Missing in Action. The producers deemed that release to be more worthy of being seen first. Well perhaps that might mean Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, the producers of both films (along with recent efforts starring Charles Bronson, martial artisans, and breakdancers; in short, the usual product of the low-budget cinematic entity of Cannon Films). This year marks the tenth anniversary of the fall of Saigon. Hardly a good reason to book Missing in Action 2: The Beginning into theatres but they're probably looking to get a jump on ticket sales before the eagerly anticipated return of Sylvester Stallone this May in Rambo: First Blood Part II.

  The film begins with Braddock and a few servicemen hastily exiting a chopper, but with good reason, as the craft has taken heavy fire from enemy forces. Flash forward several years where the survivors attempt to keep their morale up; and  endure the hell of a prisoner of war camp and its iron-willed commandant Colonel Yin (Soon Teck-Oh, probably best known for portraying James Bond's Hong Kong Secret Service colleague in 1974s The Man with the Golden Gun). In the camp, the prisoners deal with isolation from loved ones, battling malaria, random torture, and seeing escapees experience freedom--albeit short-lived thanks to booby traps the inmates are clueless to find, until they wind up being gored or flame throwered, in one of the film's gruesome sequences. There is no shortage of such scenes in Lance Hool's film, a step down from Joseph Zito's 1984 effort.
  While many real-life vets are plagued by horrific memories of fighting in Southeast Asia, this film hardly seems the proper panacea for them and the families of those who never returned. Though for a brief time those survivors might find this escapism to be a useful investment at the box office and just over an hour and a half of their time. Still any thought that Cannon might have of achieving artistic greatness with Missing in Action 2: The Beginning, is more of a grand delusion than a grand illusion.",1472428800,,2126,4.9411764705882355
