Incredibly how all the characters are changed from the original, including their names, but for whatever reason they kept the leading character name (Frank Towns, played by Dennis Quaid). Of course, his personality is also drastically changed.

A team of oil workers are flying across the desert when they encounter a violent sandstorm that sends them hurtling down into the desert. Next is the fight for survival. How they do it is one for the books. The female actress in not a romantic interest and instead is just one of the guys, which I appreciated. Great story and cast.
Highly recommend this one. If you enjoyed the first one, don't compare this one. If you enjoyed this one, don't compare the original. Watch each on its own merit and you'll find them both enjoyable. Audio and video quality are consisstent throughout.",1482278400,,738,4.514925373134329

2215549,3,B0007KIFIC,"As remakes go, ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (aka ""The Flight of the Phoenix"") is not bad but unfortunately pails in comparison to the original film of 1965. While most of the important elements from the earlier classic are present in this ""updated"" offering, the script and acting had major problems. Certainly Dennis Quaid makes a decent Towns, but what made the original character as played by Jimmie Stewart fascinating was his lack of leadership and decisiveness, a bit like the aviator equivalent of the captain of the Titanic. In the original, Stewart is an excellent pilot but indecisive when it comes to leadership. Quaid exhibits some of that in this version, at first rather indifferent to the reality of the plight and reluctant to be a leader.

For those who have seen neither film, the relatively simple plot is about an air-wreck in the desert, this time in China rather than the Sarah in the original. The survivors of the crash resolve to build a smaller plane from the wreckage to save themselves from the unforgiving desert. In this film, aboard the plane is a young man name of Elliot who has aviation designing experience. Through his knowledge, he designs and the men create a working plane from the one working engine of the wrecked plane.

One of the most glaring problems of the this new offering are the characters and their lines. In the film of 1965, we learn about the little eccentricities and shortcomings of the many character-survivors. In the new film, I had trouble getting a handle on the characters. They seemed more caricatures than characters. In the original, there are several members of the British army, one a by-the-book captain and the other a self-interested Sergeant. In the present film, they are all 21st-century ""guys"" but little about them was very distinguishable, even the one female character (not present in the original) seemed a bit too predictable.

The weakest character in terms of both script and acting was Elliot played by Giovanni Ribisi, the equivalent of Heinrich Dorfman, a German aviation engineer-designer. Elliot's script had many problems, at first acting shy and irresolute while at other times exploding unnecessarily. While Elliot's character could have worked with a better script, and you can't blame actor Giovanni Ribisi for all the problems, it's hard to beat the absolutely stellar performance by Hardy Krger in the earlier film. In one of the most crucial scenes of the story, when it's revealed the true experience of the designer-engineer in terms of aviation, the present film played out like a scene from a soap opera. In the original, the scene gradually evolves. Also in the original, the scenes were in two parts whereas in the new version, the scene is one long drawn-out confrontation.

The main saving grace of the present offering is the visuals which are certainly stronger than the original. The wreckage and the subsequent plane built by the survivors is a bit clearer. However, the visuals can't quite make up for the poor script and mediocre directing. The director was certainly excellent in terms of the visuals, but not great in terms of making his characters shine. Again, a decent viewing but probably a one-watch at best.",1447459200,,3218,4.9647495361781075
2215550,4,B0007KIFIC,"Good movie, special effect is a bit old fashioned, but acting and story line is fresh and relevant even from today's standard.",1444867200,,126,4.7727272727272725

2215554,5,B0007KIFIC,"Flight of the Phoenix is about an airplane that crashes in the Gobi desert due to a serve sandstorm in the middle of July when it's screaming hot leaving those who took the flight stranded and helpless.  Well not totally helpless.  Luckily Giovanni Ribisi (a man who resembles Elton John) knows a thing or two about building airplanes and knows that with everyone's cooperation, crazy enough they have the available means to build a new airplane and get it off the ground.  However... there's a little secret about his ""airplane building"" that I won't reveal.  It's quite the unfortunate surprise!  I didn't see it coming either.  Anyway Giovanna's mysterious and quiet demeanor almost makes him a memorable savior.  I also learned how dangerous sandstorms are, and how quickly they can hit without warning it would seem  I had no idea before watching the movie.

For the most part, the movie focuses on the entire group of stranded passengers struggling to deal with the heat and having conversations.  I didn't know it gets so hot in the Gobi desert in the summer.  Even with all kinds of online information, I'm still confused when it comes to learning about the Gobi desert.  It's the hottest desert in the world in the summer and the coldest desert in the world in the winter?  Because I know it can get down to -40 degree Fahrenheit every night in the winter.  Also it's the only ice desert in the world.  I assume that means the only desert that forms ice and isn't actually made of ice.

Anyway there's another problem going on that doesn't present itself as a major problem until later.  There's smugglers roaming around the desert riding camels, and they have guns.  They don't take too kindly to visitors or perhaps more accurately anything suspicious or out of the ordinary.  Some may think they wouldn't have been violent if it wasn't for a certain incident, but I disagree.  They killed a passenger who dropped from a plane without mercy.  We don't know the state of that man or if he was alive when he landed.  Perhaps the smugglers realized he was suffering for example (hey just thinking outside the box here).  So we can only assume he was murdered.  The passengers come into contact with these smugglers later on and the results aren't very pretty I'm afraid.  I won't reveal much more.  They don't exactly play a game of dominos together.

Anyway, what a cast!  Dennis Quaid is the pilot and loves bossing around the initially quiet and reserved Giovanni Ribisi.  Actually Dennis just has an all around nasty attitude.  He believes so strongly that everyone's doomed to die of thirst or extreme heat.  He feels the situation is totally helpless.  Hmmm, well then, I suppose I can forgive his nasty attitude then.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't exactly be screaming with happiness if I were in his shoes.  There's also Hugh Laurie, the sarcastic main actor from the hit TV show House.  I'm disappointed he wasn't given more speaking roles and was relatively quiet compared to the other characters.  He would have been ideal as the knowledgeable guy who can get the airplane off the ground, but then again I'm probably just used to his talkative House character and assume he knows all the answers.  He did know the language of the Mongolian (or Chinese) people.

There's also Tyrese Gibson, Kirk Jones and Jacob Vargas who keep it loose and try to make the best of things, even when water runs low and they have to rely on eating peaches out of giant cans.  Strange how the music they were listening to was clear and listenable.  I guess they were listening to tapes or discs though.  I probably missed that part.  Tony Curran has a more serious tone realizing the severity of the situation, as does the concerned Miranda Otto.  Scott Michael Campbell's character tries to make a run for it over the hills and well, we see how far he gets.  Not far at all!  I'm surprised when he and Dennis stumble upon all kinds of belongings scattered on the ground they don't try to skim through the things and see what they can use.  Then again Scott probably already did.

So as you can see, there's a diverse selection of actors and actresses that make it interesting.  Perhaps if there's one complaint I can find it's that the movie doesn't quite stress the severity of being stranded in a desert as much as you'd think.  The characters didn't appear to show signs of slowing down or even being sunburnt interestingly enough, but then again I'm not sure how long they were out there.  Anyway the acting is terrific, the twists and turns whenever situations go from hopeful to hopeless are very well-written, and the movie is solid overall.  That ending though... it's just too satisfying, convenient and ends too happily for my liking.  I would have liked more memorable character interaction in some way to end the film on a high note instead of taking us to the credits.  Small complaint because otherwise the film is solid.",1442275200,,4933,4.695449241540257

I loved the 1965 version with James Stewart a lot but I saw no reason to trash this one based on nostalgia for the old, classic black & white version, the way others here have done. From what others were saying I was waiting for it to be a flop and it turned out to be a pretty good movie!

I've only seen Giovanni Ribisi in comic roles previously and I was amazed at how great he was in this as the egotistical ""plane"" designer, Elliott. In fact he was perfectly cast, as I saw that his character seemed to need to compensate for his diminutive stature and prove his Aryan heritage.

The reason I would not have given it a perfect 5 otherwise, is that I think it could have used more character development.",1421020800,,844,4.134146341463414

Too much of the plot required suspension of reason, like why would you overload up an airplane with a cheap commodity like pipe?  (So when it makes the airplane crash you can spend the rest of the movie fixing the airplane with the cheap pipe.)  Why do you have garage like shop stowed unsecured in the cargo area of the airplane.  (So you can have every imaginable tool later to make a new airplane.

Kind of overloaded with action movie cliches and characters too.

Several plot developments were tossed in just to add texture - so it lost a sense of reality. Characters acted oddly immaturely, and no who put this thing together bothered to ask if this is how people would really act - and I mean real people, not just the group that hangs out together in Los Angeles. What caused my blood pressure to rise was when the characters announced that the plane was ready to fly; we then see two nomads (we already know they're supposed to be bad) peeking at them from a nearby sand dune. So do the characters then leap onto the plane and skedaddle out of there? No, they ponder why they aren't immediately being attacked and then they ignore that whole development and hang out and chat.

2215784,5,B0007KIFIC,"If you're looking for a way to spend 2 hours of your weekend with a date or family member and want to see a good film, watch this movie! Basically they took the original and adapted it to the modern day, but removed everything bad about it, including over-used British actors(common in that day), a crotchety stubborn Pilot in Jimmy Stewart whom acted more like Mr Potter from ""It's a wonderful life"" than George Bailey, changed a 3 hour bore-fest that was the original into something shorter that is fast paced from start to finish. Finally they adapted the best CGI and action sequences to the newer version to give us a film that is actually well paced and entertaining.  Just try watching the original version after you've seen any of the thrillers or action movies of the 80's and 90's and you probably won't make it past the first 30 minutes, it's that boring. They literally sit around the plane and talk for nearly 2 hours..

About a third of the reviews are from people claiming that this movie was boring, that it wasn't like the original, that it didn't live up to their expectations, but they are way off base.  These people think that no movies will ever compare to the black and white movies they grew up that defined the experiences of their generation.  These people took movies so seriously they voted Ronald Reagan(an actor) as President!(yes I liked him myself but I'm making a point). They compare every movie with Gone with the Wind and every actor to Shirley Temple.  Even taking a movie like this and freshening it up with action and special affects and a few good actors(Dennis Quad, Giovanni Ribisi) would not satisfy many in this older culture.  You want to talk about who has a right to voice dissention, talk to 80's and 90's kids and what they've done our movies.  At least you didn't have to suffer through Transformers or soon to be Ninja Turtles..(shudders).  Well either way this movie will provide an entertaining 2 hours of relaxation for anyone who gives it a chance and the ending is FAR better in the new version than the original.. far better and with more hope.",1397520000,,2101,4.613941018766756

The characters were horrible. Dennis Quaid deserves an award for actually bothering to try. Poor Giovanni Ribisi wasn't given much to go on. Miranda Otto was entirely forgettable; and Kirk Jones volunteers himself to play a stereotype (Hollywood really needs to stop writing that part, it's shameful)

Kirk should have been playing Scott Campbell's part, who wastes 10 minutes of screen time mumbling lines as he appears to be reading from a cue card 50 yards away. Seriously, how does Campbell get work?

Oh, and there's Hugh Laurie...

But you're not watching Flight of the Phoenix for the drama or the visionary film-making. You're watching it because you're bored and you saw everything else already and you really just want to vegetate for 120 minutes with a bowl of ice cream.

I watched it the other night on my Ipad laying in bed from my hotel, and it was as bad as I originally thought.  It doesn't hold a candle to the original and the added touches of including a nice looking female in the ""new cast"" and some efforts at special effects just doesn't cut it.  Don't waste your time.

The most important question of our time, I think. A major part of the original but barely touched upon in the remake. Some of the remake is also pretty far-fetched and some is downright silly. Not the worst movie ever made but if you have something better to do, go do it.

2215821,5,B0007KIFIC,Nice movie to watch. People working together to survive. They improvised and used alot of equipment to get them to leave.,1395964800,,121,4.809523809523809
2215822,2,B0007KIFIC,"I cannot find anything much to recommend in this mostly pointless remake. See the 1965 James Stewart/Richard Attenborough/Robert Aldrich film instead. I can't even recommend the remake for big fans of the original, such as myself, because this one adds nothing, loses much, and benefits no one except possibly the folks who got paid to make the film. On that score I'm happy for them, but this will not be at the top of anyone's resume.",1395964800,,436,4.75
2215823,4,B0007KIFIC,"I don't always like remakes of movies so I didn't know what to expect.
The original did not have a women in the story. I was glad to see her character developed with equal strength of the men. No cheap romance thrown in.
The model plane builder's character was a little obnoxious at times.
If you liked the old movie, you would probably like this one.",1395878400,,351,4.333333333333333
2215824,5,B0007KIFIC,"As good as the original James Stewart movie in its own way, plus a few twists. Aviation buffs may pick it to death on detail, especially the way the cargo was loaded and lashed down, but I don't think it was meant as a documentary. Gotta love those old C-119 flying boxcars!",1395878400,,274,4.288461538461538
2215825,5,B0007KIFIC,Loved it. This movie was filled with intense moments. It's a movie about a group of people who get stranded in the desert after a plane crash... Perseverance.,1395792000,,158,4.678571428571429

2215827,4,B0007KIFIC,I liked the original with Jimmy Stewart but I like this one better because it is more up to date.  This version appeals more to a modern mind that is accustomed to the power of data and its use in a practical way.,1395705600,,213,3.953488372093023

2215829,5,B0007KIFIC,"The characters are solid. The lack of a love interest works well. Randy excellent as are the others.

The last scene of the chase would have been better left out, with the emphasis on flying.  The post fly out pictures were spectacular and on point, especially with the boss playing golf...alone again.",1395705600,,302,4.788461538461538
2215830,3,B0007KIFIC,Maybe because I saw the original movie.  Overall intertaining but did not seem original.  Many technical details were covered in a brief attempt to amuse the average audience.,1395705600,,175,5.214285714285714
2215831,2,B0007KIFIC,"As a commercial pilot, flight instructor, absolute aviation fan, and professional outdoor guide . . . I'm afraid that this is not a movie to watch if you're looking for a good flying or survival story. The aviation scenes are truly absurd and the desert survival scenes are nearly as bad.

There's some fun acting and tolerable script, but the premise upon which it's all built is so shoddy that it's difficult to see past.",1395619200,,423,4.64

real catch was how they got out. Since I play with Model airplanes as well, and know design is design. It will fly or it won't!",1395273600,,278,4.072727272727272
2215842,2,B0007KIFIC,The original with Jimmy Stewart was fine and should have been left alone. This new version essentially crashed on take-off. Only some of the visuals and aircraft footage worth watching.,1395273600,,185,5.2

Quite frankly, I loved all the characterizations and the acting too. Seemed natural!

I just think it is a great movie to watch and shows how people, when they work together, can make things happen and also save each other.........",1395187200,,443,4.740259740259741

And now I enjoyed watching it again recently on Amazon Instant Video.  I saw the movie at the theater in early 2005.  The Amazon release through my media streamer and my receiver and my Samsung tv had all the great sound and color that the blu-ray disc had and the theater release displayed.

2215870,4,B0007KIFIC,"Remaking an iconic movie like this is similar to covering the Stones song ""Satisfaction"". There are a lot of ways it can go pear shaped. Surprisingly, nothing did. It succeeds by being more of a reboot than a remake. Although we know that they'll make the plane fly, the story of how is interesting and compelling. Cast is good but Quaid really drives it.

Like other great movies, I have seen the original 1967 film several times, but I have no intention of seeing the 2004 remake again.

2215932,2,B0007KIFIC,"Overall, no too bad -- if you can watch if for free! Saw the original several times. This remake lacked dramatic tension of original. Who could forget that famous Jimmy Stewart scene where it was revealed the ""designer"" actually designed MODEL airplanes, not the real things?  Watching Stewart come totally unglued, now THAT was acting!  Same scene as done in this film was flat except for Hugh Laurie's deranged attempt to shoot the designer -- about the only REAL dramatic acting in the entire film. In this film we learn absolutely NOTHING about the background of the pilot (whom I believe was an ex-alcoholic loser in the original).

Actors / director failed to show the sense of total exhaustion and desperation we saw in the original. I found it ridiculous that the one female character always seemed to be in perfect makeup except for a few dirty smudges and some dirty clothes. This ensemble struck me as being on a family vacation in Vegas, not dying of thirst and starvation in the Gobi. Oh by the way, where did the bandits find water for their horses?  Camels I understand, they're desert animals, horses are not!

But the ending was a total joke!!!!!  All you see is the plane flying off into the sunset and -- if you watched very carefully -- you'd see a poor CGI rendition of what's was supposed to be some sort of structure, maybe another oil rig.  Missing is the final scene showing our motley crew straggling up over a sand dune and tumbling into a pool of water -- they landed at an oasis.  Instead, they put up this silly montage scene showing happily-ever-after future snapshots of our characters pursuing their life dreams.  Ugh, cheesy!!

I think these guys ran out of money & couldn't afford to shoot the proper final oasis scene.

I don't fault someone for doing a remake with a different spin, but the original Flight Of The Phoenix was a very heavy dramatic film, the audience actually got excited about seeing the new plane coming together and flying; you could almost feel the character's sense of hopelessness.  Everyone was made-up to show open sores, cuts, split parched lips, circles under the eyes, etc.  Yet I saw none of that in this film.

No one should be proud of this film - weak performances, special effects that look like they were done by the crew from CSI in their spare time, and a script full of holes.  Who carries a dozen five-gallon jugs full of water on a heavily-loaded cargo flight OUT of the desert, to Beijing?  The endless parade of mishaps don't inspire dread, they inspire wonder that any of these people can make a living at their jobs.

Visually the film looks great on blu-ray even for a very average transfer job. I actually believe that the surround sound is a step above the visuals. You'll want to turn that up to theater level and listen to the great sounds of the airplane and storm. It's a great scene to demo if you own even a mediocre home theater.

2215954,3,B0007KIFIC,"This version of ""Flight of the Phoenix"" was released at the end of 2004 and is a modern take on the 1965 film with Jimmy Stewart.

THE PLOT: A group of mostly oil workers crash land in the Gobi Desert where being found by a search party is unlikely. One of the passengers turns out to be an airplane designer who insists that they can create a new plane with the workable parts of the wreckage. Although an outlandish idea, it may be their only legitimate chance at survival.

The plot is exactly the same as the original version with a few notable differences: It takes place about 40 years later; it includes a woman (Miranda Otto); it features a more racially mixed cast; and it takes place in the Gobi Desert rather than the Libyan Desert (although it was shot in Namibia, while the original was filmed in the deserts of SE California).

I'm not one of those people who hates the very idea of remakes. I'm open to filmmakers taking a heralded classic and modernizing it, like the excellent remake of ""The Parent Trap."" That's what we get with this remake of ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" except that it's not excellent. But it's not bad either.

Although there are some new touches that are as good or even superior to the original (Like Liddle's powerful line to Towns in the debris field, as well as the confrontation with the Mongols sequence), this modernization ultimately pales in the shadow of the original. Why? There's less focus on character development and therefore the movie has less interesting characters. Instead the filmmakers opt for scenes that might maintain the attention of those with ADHD, like an explosion scene, a lightning storm sequence and a dubious attack by the Mongol smugglers at the very end (shouldn't they have attacked while they were pulling the aircraft? Or earlier?). But the biggest negative is that the movie just lacks the brilliant dramatic flow of the original.

The film runs 113 minutes.

FINAL WORD: This would be a better film for anyone who hasn't seen the original, but if you've seen the '65 version it's just so mediocre by comparison. Still, it's worth checking out if, like me, you love survival films. And it is interesting to see a different take on the same basic story.

When the price dropped to a reasonable price I snapped it up. The show, reminiscent of the original was updated. The companies rep was there played by Hugh Laurie from House MD as well as a crusty captain played by Dennis Quade. The cast like in the original was made up of people from all around the world, some couldn't get along even with their friends. What brought them together was their desire not to die without trying something to get them out. Deserts are not fun, especially with nomadic tribesmen's wanting them dead and stealing their belongings. If you want drama with action this movie is it.

This remake is action driven rather than character driven like the original. There are plenty of sand storms, enemy Arabs, electrical storms and explosions. It has a woman who doesn't seem to have any real purpose other than to integrate a female into the racially mixed group. Nothing makes this remake shine above the original where fantastic acting and facial expressions fueled the entire movie.

The man who played the model airplane builder was miscast and unconvincing. He must have been selected for his appearance and physical likeness to the original star rather than his acting ability. I never forgot that he was an actor playing a role.

Another thing that irritated me was the lack of detail. This group was supposedly ravaged by the hot desert sun for weeks, yet not one of them had a facial blister or burned skin. Their physical strength never deteriorated over the course of time. The original made me feel their despair, their hopes, their doubts and their final victory.

The tale revolves around an arrogant aviator (Dennis Quaid)who lives to regret almost all of his actions; a female geologist employed by a giant oil company looking for Black Gold and finding none, but adding interest as one who brings out the best in him later, naturally; a host of other quirky personalities; and best of all, a quasi-genius tag-along who almost didn't make the initial boarding of the ill-fated exodus flight out of the drilling site because nobody really knew who he was.

I was especially impressed with the nerdy performance given by Giovanni Ribisi as the aeronautics ""engineer"" who obviously possessed enough brain power to successfully accomplish the real thing, and against impossible odds, too. He thinks he can re-engineer a disaster under a searing desert sun, hampered by people he sees as inferiors, as well as finding out they are surrounded by indigenous enemies who would do them all in at a moments misstep. Plenty of those missteps are made in such a truly bumbling fashion that one almost - but not quite - can see the dire point of the eccentric genius when he unceremoniously takes matters into his own hands for a hair-raising moment.  And the flame and black smoke belching out of the engine as they attempted the start-up was startling enough to leave me clutching my chest - in my opinion, that was vastly more effective than any of the other special effects - which paled in comparison.

There are some cheesy moments, but all in all, the story itself carried it through.",1304121600,,1683,4.813148788927336

However, I feel I wasted my time when I could have rather been watching something else. Something Better. The movie has its moments. However, I would recommend rather watching/buying the original with James Stewart. I just found, especially when the bickering started, one just does not have any sympathy for any of these people. You are just hoping they would all wander out into the desert and die. Slowly. It amazes me how strong and feisty they all are surviving on minimal water and canned peaches. However, when they are stupid anough to approach some wandering Tauregs (or whatever tribes wander the Gobi desert-- Mongolians? They ride ponies) ) to ask for water (yea right)-  and this after finding one of their own mysteriously shot -I was hoping one of the team was going to be bumping off the others - would have made for a much more entertaining movie). However, at this stage one actually hopes these desert people will bury them all in the sand,  cover their heads with honey, blow up their plane, and then ride their horses into the sunset, whooping with joy.

Although there are a few sand dunes, most of the Mongolian desert is rough, hard-packed terrain. Heat, sweat, sand storms? I don't think so.

If the writers want us to suspend disbelief, we can do that. After all, some of us play ""quidditch."" We can even believe that Hugh Laurie willingly consented to act in this film. (Although it is my personal opinion that they were holding his children hostage.)

2215978,2,B0007KIFIC,"I won't give this one a long review.  It doesn't deserve one.  It is a rip-off of the great Jimmy Stewart-Hardy Kruger movie of the same name.  This film doesn't even start to compare.  Worse, in a time of a war against fundamentalist terrorism, this film tries to be politically correct...politically correct, that is, if you are a Hollywood Loonie Tunes.

Rather than the North Africa and torture by Arabic bandits this film is placed in northern Asia and the assault is by a large band of Mongol banditos which Quaid, I think it is, manages to shoot to pieces with one of those pistols that never need to be reloaded.  In way of criticism, there are still Arab marauders in the deserts of North Africa.  Mongol bandits are, however, an anachronism having disappeared rather thoroughly with the Communist regimes of the last 65 years or more.

The only good part of the film is that in which a Mongol raider has been wounded and taken prisoner.  This represents a significant drain on limited resources.  The computer nerd, I think from Long Beach, California, proves himself to be not quite such a nerd by shooting him dead while the other wrecked passengers are wringing their hands.  Problem solved.

2215980,3,B0007KIFIC,"Hollywood is far from done using the long dead bodies of old movies to recreate them into something original and different yet using the same story as before. The remake fever is upon them! In an effort to draw back movie goers who are flocking from theaters, Hollywood regurgitates movies they hope people will at least remember the title of. It works some times, and other not. This one does.

Dennis Quaid highlights the cast as a rough and ready pilot who works for hire. On a routine flight taking the crew and executives from an oil drilling that didn't offer what was expected, they encounter a freak sandstorm. Doing his best to avoid the storm at all costs, luck doesn't ride with the group. Major damage happens and the plane crashes in the middle of the desert.

At first the group hopes for the best, salvaging what they can and making the best of their situation. But knowing that the antenna was the first thing to be damaged and with no distress call making its way, they come to realize that their chances of being rescued are slim. One by one the effects of the heart and fear work at each member that has survived.

But one select (Giovanni Ribisi) member feels that there is a chance if only everyone else will listen to him. Explaining that he has worked on designing planes, he sees hope in the wreckage of the cargo plane, a way to give it new life and to fly them home to safety. His biggest detractor is the pilot himself, Quaid.

Maintaining not only sanity but safety in the desert under the hot sun is not something easily done. And when one of the group wanders off in search of help, Quaid sets out to find him. This he does but not before they come across the body of a passenger sucked out during the crash. Not only do they find themselves having to contend with a sickening sight, they discover that his body has been ransacked. The only explanation? Raiders from the desert.

Making their way back to the plane, Quaid agrees to the possible solution. Now the group must work together to try and raise the plane back to life, the phoenix of the title back from the ashes. And while they do so, they must also find a way to insure that these desert raiders do not discover and annihilate them.

The minutes count down, the plane reconstruction has its ups and downs and the groups also finds that they have to contend with dissension or thieves in their midst. But through it all, the sense of hope inspires them to work hard and find a solution to their problem. Even if the not quite finished task at hand draws in attention of the raiders as the seconds count down to a climactic finish.

Few people remember the original film remade here. Starring James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine and Hardy Kruger among others, it was considered a classic. But this film does that one justice while making it on its own. You can feel the heat. You can almost smell the sweat. And you can sense the fear of a group of people thrown in together knowing that sure death awaits them if they do nothing. This is one solid movie that deserves to be watched and enjoyed.

Both movies, however, pale in comparison to the book by Elleston Trevor.  Darker and more intense than the movies, the first sentence sets the tone: ""The wind had flung the sand thirty thousand feet into the sky above the desert in a blinding cloud from the Niger to the Nile, and somewhere in it was the airplane.""  Even if you're reading this book in the middle of the winter or in a torrential downpour of rain, by the time you're half way through it you'll be parched and on the edge of your seat.

2215984,2,B0007KIFIC,"Sadly, Flight of the Phoenix is just another duff remake. Despite massive advances in special effects and a moderately exciting last two minutes, this feels even longer than Robert Aldrich's much longer original, and the reason is pretty elementary: lack of characterisation and drama. Where Aldrich typically set his flawed protagonists at each others throats in a hostile environment that was driving them mad and dealt with the way the pilot who crashes off-course in the desert turns his guilt into anger at his passengers, this is mostly feel-good stuff, full of life lessons, spiritual slogans and far too much high fiving for any self respecting survival drama - at one point they even get down and boogie. A modicum of drama is thrown in at the last minute in the wake of the key revelation about the new plane's designer, but it's so little and so late that it totters on the edge of laughable. As a result, some good actors and Giovanni Ribisi (horribly overacting the old Hardy Kruger part minus the Nazi undertones) are stranded by committee filmmaking rather than the elements and poor piloting.

Strangely, for such a bland film, the making of documentary is surprisingly gloves off, showing director John Moore in full effing and blinding mode as he throws several fits (and he's not the only one). At least one of the extended scenes (involving a biplane) was good enough to be in the feature, and the commentary throws up the odd interesting fact amid the mutual back slapping. The result is a modest extras package that easily outshines the film.",1182038400,,1564,4.857677902621723

2215987,5,B0007KIFIC,"I understand this movie is actually a remake of an earlier movie starring James Stewart in the sixties. I did not watch the earlier movie, even though James Stewart was a favourite actor of mine, but I certainly enjoy watching this one.

The storyline is very simple: A ragtag bunch of characters on a cargo plane crash-landed somewhere in the Gobi Desert. They worked together, led (or misled?) by an eccentric character, Elliot (played menacingly by Giovanni Ribisi), who had only some experience with model air plane design, to rebuild the plane from the wreckage & then to fly back to civilisation.

In a nut shell, it is essentially a movie about the triumph of the indomitable human spirit. What I like about this movie is watching the ragtag bunch of diverse characters eventually working together & using their sheer ingenuity & imagination to rebuild the plane, in spite of extremely hostile conditions - no contact with the outside world, brutal environment (scorching sun & scathing sandstorms), dwindling resources & attack by desert marauders. The dialogue is very witty...sometimes funny...coupled by a spectacular crash sequence, which has been seemingly extended for viewers' enjoyment.

This movie also brought back some sweet memories of my trip across the southern end of the Gobi Desert about a decade ago. At that time, I was trying to retrace the journey of Marco Polo along the Silk Road. I rode on a camel as well as on four-wheels across some short stretches. The view of the sand dunes was magnificent & enchanting, but I could sense the harsh reality of the environment. [This movie was actually filmed on location in Namibia, Africa.]

Only one aspect of the movie really puzzles me. As a Chinese, I noted that the desert marauders apparently spoke Cantonese. The crash scene happened in the Mongolian part of the Gobi Desert - people there don't speak Cantonese.

Lastly but not the least, I have also enjoyed watching Dennis Quaid, one of my favourite actors, playing the lead role of Frank Towns, the crack pilot.

Overall, the movie has been great to watch.",1154217600,,2089,4.937321937321937
2215988,4,B0007KIFIC,"Flight of the Phoenix, directed by John Moore and starring Dennis Quaid, is a good flick if you are looking for something light. Quaid does a good portrayal of the pilot who crashes his plane in the desert, along with passengers from an oil-rig. With their hopes for rescue dwindling along their water and food supplies, they become convinced by one of the passengers, a stranger who says he designs airplanes, that they can build another airplane out of the parts from the wrecked plane. Giovanni Ribisi plays the stranger in an appropriately creepy manner-- one is left with the feeling that if and when the new plane gets back to civilization, the other passengers will kill him upon arrival.

Miranda Otto also does a fine job as Kelly, the oil-rig operator; and it's nice to see that there is no big deal made about the fact that she is a woman. Neither does the movie throw in a romance between her and any of the other characters-- she is simply another one of the ""guys"".

Inevitably you will want to compare this to the old Jimmy Stewart movie or the book upon which it is based. Don't, because if you do, it will inevitably fall short in the comparison. However, taken on its own, the plane crash is scary, the tension is high, and except for a stupid subplot involving bandits, it is fun to watch.",1150416000,,1308,4.514767932489452

2215993,3,B0007KIFIC,"If you rate this movie as an adventure film, it is purely run-of-the-mill.  The characters are, as these movies go, shallow with motivations that are paper thin.  The characters behave with the usual stupidity of such characters.  For example, when you are in the desert, why would you go running up to a group of men unaccompanied by women, particularly if the men are dressed in dark clothing and carrying a lot of weapons?  The lack of women and the isolation of the men should have been clues to the survivors of a plane crash that the men should be observed for a while before running up to them.

This movie is a nearly identical copy of the original, with a few minor exceptions.  A group of men are on their way to a desert outpost when their plane crashes.  The men, oops, one of the minor differences is that this movie includes a woman, decide that they can rebuild the plane and escape the desert.  Another difference in this movie from the original is the addition of a group of sinister nomads with guns.  The movie never explains the sinister nomads, and why the sinister nomads would go chasing after a plane as it begins to take off (the plane is leaving, the men are mobile and on horseback, once the plane is gone there is virtually no threat to the sinister men without motive - oh, wait; we needed some kind of action to obtain the all important young, male demographic).

Two areas of excellence for this movie are the action and the special effects.  However, both are required to make up for the lack of coherent plot.  As long as the audience is not thinking about the movie they will have insufficient time to analyze what is happening and the implausibility of some of the activity.

In the original 1965 version of the movie the focus of the movie was the battle of the men against the desert and against themselves, ultimately triumphing over the desert and learning to work as a team.  This movie still has the desert, but the skillful development of characters is thrown out the window in favor of special visual effects and pointless action.

The beginning was fast paced and scarry yet breathtaking to watch. I like movies with themes, such as a winter movie, lost in the woods story, battling the elements such as a ranging sea or a scorching desert. So in the beginning we see Denis Quaid and Tyrese Gibson pick up Miranda Otto and her fellow co-workers because they did not get a grant on their oil digging search, as they have to pack up and abandon the place they worked at.

From the beginning there's big and obvious tension between the plane crew and the workers as they don't like each other. Little do they know that they will have to learn to live and work together as they fly through a magnanamous sand storm that rips their plane apart and strands them in the Gobi desert.

The plane crash scene was fast, scarry and amazingly made. The desert view, the colors, sun, heat, fast speed, it was all beautiful yet chilling. I wanted to reving and watch the scene again, but I got too sucked in to even consider taking bathroom breaks, as I watched the movie and my dinner got cold in front of me.

The real part that I enjoyed was seeing how they managed to strive for survival inthe most remote place on Earth, come together and try to get out and keep on living. THey had to ration out canned food, water, watch out for armed and dangerous nomads and try to survive.

This is a movie you have to see, it's hard to explain but I thought it was wonderful! THe second we were done watching it I wanted to watch another desert movie! Couldnt find one though!

2215998,1,B0007KIFIC,"This is an awful remake of a magnificent film.  Most of the elements that made the original a classic are missing.  However, many other elements were added in order to ""update"" the story, including a female character (perhaps to provide potential romantic interest, although no romantic interest actually ever develops), a rock music soundtrack (which detracts from rather than adds to the story), a meaningless bandit cavalry charge to provide suspense (it doesn't), a character who philosophizes against the evils of religion, and the inevitable (in today's Hollywood) big bad corporate bigwig throwing his weight around against the poor victims of the big bad corporate financial interests that supposedly decided not to bother looking for their lost plane.

Additionally, the casting isn't very good, nor is the acting.  None of the great acting and character development of the original are present here.  The original had at least a half-dozen superb, memorable performances; this version has none.  The main character should have been an over-the-hill retread like the plane he was flying, as in the original.  Instead, a ""romantic leading man"" had to be cast as the pilot because there was now a woman cast opposite him, and the result is a character who develops no chemistry with either the female lead or the plot.

But possibly -- no, definitely -- the film's worst problem is the inept direction, which relies on technical gimmicks (camera motion, quick cuts, voice inaudibility during moments of action, etc.) in a failed attempt to replace the emotion that should have been provided by the story and the acting.  This and the previously mentioned problems make it nearly impossible for the movie to gel in any way that could produce a meaningful emotional response in the audience.  In all, this a miserable attempt at reviving a classic film -- one that never really gets off the ground.",1133136000,,1903,5.090032154340836
2215999,3,B0007KIFIC,"This remake of the great 1965 film Flight of the Phoenix was not as bad I thought it might be.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Director John Moore did a good job of sticking to the original plot line.

All the main characters give a fair representation of the original.  Dennis Quaid plays pilot Frank Towns, who was played by Jimmy Stewart in the original film, pays due tribute to Stewart in this role.  And, Giovanni Ribissi does OK as the nemishy Elliot character, though I thought Hardy Kruger as Heinrich Dorfmann was a more interesting character.  The rest of the supporting cast, with the exception of Kevork Malikyan as Rady, are mostly unforgettable.  There is no one equivilant to Peter Finch or Dan Duryea in this production and most of the cast just seem to be window dressing for a younger audience.

The film is beautiful to watch and not unpleasing to the eye.  The production team is to be commended for using Namibia as the back drop for this film.  Where this film fails visually is its overuse of special effects.  Finally, with the exception of Johnny Cash's ""I've Been Everywhere"" the music is just too loud and adds nothing to this movie.  Though if you purchase the soundtrack you will not hear this song or any of the rock  or hip-hop tunes in the movie, you get just background music.

The director gets credit for including a female role in this film and not adding the all too frequent hoochie factor.  This movie is OK for something to watch, but I say make sure you see the original 1965 production first.",1133049600,,1533,4.564102564102564
2216000,2,B0007KIFIC,"It's hard to be fair to the new ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" an adaptation of the novel by Elleston Trevor, because I keep wanting desperately to compare it to Robert Aldrich's 1965 film version, which got everything so right that I wonder why a remake was necessary. The fact that John Moore, the director of this new version, gets everything wrong in those same places makes me eager to simply make my review a list of direct comparisons.

I'll try not to, however, since every time I confront a remake, I always tell myself to judge it on its own terms. (Such advice doesn't always work, of course, especially when the new version is a pale imitation of a classic.) I will allow myself a one sentence contrast, and it is this: where the 1965 film takes its time letting the story unravel on its own, quietly but fiercely, the 2004 version opts to make everything louder, and louder, and louder, until it's convinced that the only way to get dramatic impact from such a premise is to pound loudness into the viewer.

For a while (and here's where I force myself to ignore the original movie... good luck), Moore's ""Phoenix"" gets things right. It shakes up the story a bit, ditching the military characters and making everyone involved employees of an oil company. Flying out of a lousy Mongolian outpost, they get slammed by a nasty sandstorm and crash in the Gobi desert, presumably somewhere just inside the China border, although nobody's too sure. The crash sequence is great stuff, nerveracking and fierce, one-upping such modern crash scenes as the one in ""Cast Away."" So far, so good.

With survival a prime issue, a bizarre stranger and the film's only non-oil company employee (Giovanni Ribisi) suggests they build a new plane out of the working parts remaining from the old one - a plot point that doesn't appear until much later in the 1965 version (sorry, can`t help myself), suggesting that this new version is eager to tighten things up, move things along much faster, and simply Get On With It.

It's around here that things start to go south. Uncertain of how to keep things moving in a movie in which so little happens, screenwriters Scott Frank (who should've known better) and Edward Burns (who doesn't, no surprise) keep tossing in increasingly annoying moments. It all starts with the casting of Sticky Fingaz (perhaps not his birth name?) as an eye-patched badass; his character exists merely to inject some hip-hop lingo into the proceedings. We even get a bit in which he takes over the stereo system and blares Outcast's ""Hey Ya!"" Good song, bad scene.

Then come the occasional explosion or electrical storm, which make for some decent action sequences but feel too forced and out of place in what's meant to be more of a character piece. And, in what evolves into an obnoxious turn of events, the arrival of a tribe of nomad baddies (arms smugglers, the story guesses), handled so expertly last time out (sorry again!), here becomes a cop out - whenever the plot gets stuck, just toss in some random nomads. (Their arrival during the final scene was so unnecessary that it borders on laughable.) By attempting to spruce things up for a modern audience, the film winds up being a series of wrong choices.

Worst of all, the filmmakers opted to dumb things down, instead of trusting the viewer to be remotely intelligent. There's an overlong explanation of the meaning of ""phoenix"" dropped in for all the morons in the audience, and a major revelation regarding one character is drawn out past its breaking point (the clumsiness of the scripting is only intensified by Marco Beltrami's ham-fisted musical score, which mistakes ""loud"" for ""important"").

Moore, who also made the dumb-but-enjoyable Owen Wilson actioner ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" here tries to cram too much action into a film that doesn't need it. Fortunately, the cast rescues many a scene. Dennis Quaid, in the Jimmy Stewart role, is as magnetic a screen personality as he's ever been, and his energetic presence keeps the story plowing over its mistakes. Ribisi makes for a nice mystery man (even if the script fumbles the mystery); Miranda Otto is wonderful enough (and gorgeous enough) to make things worth watching; model-turned-actor Tyrese Gibson shows a growing promise as a star; and Hugh Laurie brings more out of his character's breakdown than the script requires, thank goodness.

Still, the cast can't fully save a dying production. This new ""Phoenix"" makes too many mistakes, the biggest one being the mistake of confusing ""modernizing"" with ""dumbing down."" Moore's version may interest those unfamiliar with the original movie, if only because they don't know what they're missing.

After a spectacular plane crash, complete with swirling camera movements (hey! look what we can do!), the plane and the film grind to a complete halt. Inane, cringe inducing dialogue, badly enacted (okay, half the cast really aren't actors) by the most forced looking all encompassing racially covered cast (five minutes into the film I was wondering how they could have forgotten the Orientals). The actors get absolutely no help from director John Moore (must remember that name in case I ever see it on another film) and by the end of the film Quaid looks like he's still waiting,leaving Giovanni Ribisi the only cast member interested in or capable of giving a performance, instead of line readings. But in the end he too fails, going overboard on one of his patented oddball characters without being reined in by any half-way decent director, which Moore is not. (Half-assed, definitely).  The 1965 original was just this short of being a classic, but it is a memorable, uncomfortable tale of survival, one in which the outcome cannot be gauged. I remember the broken, painful to look at chapped lips on the actors and their dirty, smelly looking clothes and sunburnt skin. Here, although drinking water is in short supply, everyone looks like they just had a shower at a Hollywood spa (hey, it was only a plane crash!) I guess the plane was full of sun-block and Chapstick too. Exceptionally photographed though.

2216011,1,B0007KIFIC,"Disappointment is just one of the emotions felt after viewing this cinematic failure.  Frustration, aggravation, and anger could also be used, but mainly it was disappointment.  One of the most important rules of making a film is to incorporate believable characters into an unbelievable situation.  Flight of the Phoenix proves that you can place unbelievable characters in an unbelievable situation, and the end result will be ... well ... unbelievable (not in a good way).  From the very blurry beginning, until the incredibly cheesy ending, this film gives us a taste of Hollywood proving that sometimes creativity, originality, and strong storytelling falls to the wayside to allow for more of Hollywood's leading men the ability to prance around shirtless.  From the non-existent acting, to the scattered story, and finally followed by a very predictable and unrealistic ending, The Flight of the Phoenix never really took off to begin with.  This was one of those films that tried to stuff as much in as possible without any thought to the five basic questions (who, what, where, when, and why) and thinking of the female drive in replace of a decent story.

To tell a good story, you must have a strong leader to guide you through the rough spots.  Since Flight of the Phoenix was nothing but rough spots, I was looking forward to having the best leader who would draw my attention away from these distractions.  Sadly, there was no leader, thus it forced me to focus on the gaping plot holes and meaningless dribble that happened throughout this film.  Dennis Quaid was not the best choice for this picture.  To make this film work, you needed to have someone strong, brainy, and a bit egotistical.  You needed a leader, not one that would just sit around waiting for a rescue team to arrive.  His nonchalant acting (bordering apathetic) never quite meshed well with the other actors.  This didn't make him the central focus of the film, but instead turned our focus on Giovanni Ribisi's character.  Sadly, nothing was given to us about Ribisi's character throughout the film, so we were forced to see an unknown character acting a bit eccentric.  To me it didn't make much sense and lead to the very uneventful climax.  With Quaid doing his least and Ribisi going a bit overboard, I would normally look towards the other characters to provide at least one line of enjoyment ... again ... normally ... but not in this case.  Instead, what you found was the most diverse cast that I have ever seen, all of which are vying for more screen time.  So, each push forward, nothing gets accomplish, the audience looses faith in the characters.  Then, you have Miranda Otto.  I only section her out because I had no honest clue what her role was in this film other than to provide a female interpretation on what was happening.  You can't have all these men in the desert without some woman ... someone is going to be angry, and it will be up to Hollywood to show the diversity.  It was pathetic and it felt forced to me.

I will give some credit that there was some creativity involved, but it was the overall development and final direction which lost all of the creativity that Flight of the Phoenix may have had going for it.  Plane goes down in the desert and a group of people must rebuild before they die of dehydration.  Interesting concept, but just not done well.  There was too much sitting around and waiting for the first half of the film, where there could have been some decent character development or studies, instead we have these huge long-shots of the desert which is to show the vast nature of their surroundings.  This was a great technique to use, but sadly director John Moore created the opposite effect than what he was going for.  I understand that he was trying to show the vast landscape and how there was really no way for our ... is heroes to easy of a word? ... to escape the desert.  He wanted the feel of the film to be this huge desert, but instead I felt trapped.  I felt trapped in a characterless world where the scenery seemed like it should all have ""Made in Hollywood"" stamped on the back.  I just could not grasp the horror that this team was feeling, and while some of that may be the actor's fault, I do feel that Moore had something to do with it as well.  His ethics behind the camera, I do believe, hurt the final product of this film.

Finally, I cannot complain about this enough, but for me to fall in step with characters, I need to know their names, their weaknesses, and something about their lives.  My biggest issue with the film Black Hawk Down and Tears of the Sun was that I didn't know any of the soldiers really well, so when they started dying I didn't know who they were, nor did I care.  This is similar to what I felt when I watched this film.  I knew only two-three of the characters really well, while the others were extremely expendable.  When this happens, and something tragic happens to them, it will not evoke any emotion from you.  Most of the time you shrug it off and wait for the next nameless victim.  It is sad, but I can add Flight of the Phoenix to the ever-growing list of films that decided to use this technique.

Working around films so much I have seen so many patrons rent this film and come back with such glowing remarks.  While most loved this film, I cannot agree with them because without decent characters, a stronger story, and a defined reason as to why Miranda Otto was involved with this project, then I cannot say this was a valued film in my book.

First, the casting is poor.  As the pilot and main character, Dennis Quaid's all-American, average guy persona just doesn't work.  Giovanni Ribisi comes close to over-the-top acting, and the other characters - especially those played by Hugh Laurie and Tyrese - are completely one-dimensional stock characters whose actions can be easily predicted.

There's very little in the way of action, with most of the time spent on trite dialogue or needless shots of the desert and the plane.  When events start to unfold, their outcome can be guessed well in advance.  And while I don't have a problem with being able to guess the movie's ultimate outcome, a little bit of suspense would have helped.

Finally, the ""updates"" on the characters that are shown during the credits may be the corniest thing I've seen in a movie this year.  We really could have done without that touch.

Captain Frank Towns, (Dennis Quaid), a gritty, arrogant pilot and his trusty co-pilot, (Tyrese Gibson), fly into the remote site to take Kelly, the pretty lady who runs the oil rig, (Miranda Otto), and her interracial, international crew, back to Beijing and off the payroll. Elliot, the mystery man, (Giovanni Ribisi), arrives at the last minute and asks to hitch a ride. Ribisi, who is 90% of what is good with this film, is outfitted like a real dork - bleached blonde hair, glasses and no demonstrable affect whatsoever. Kelly rolls her eyes, and informs Towns that she'll explain about Elliot later. Later, as in shortly after take-off, the plane flies into a killer sandstorm. In pure volume, this whirlwind packs in sand and dust what ""The Perfect Storm"" carried in water. When the co-pilot opts to turn back, our Captain says, ""Nah."" Not worth wasting the time.

What follows is one of the longest, scariest airplane crashes I have ever seen on film. Director John Moore milked this scene for all its worth. However, if the viewer has no fear of flying, and is in the safety of the living room, with plenty of popcorn, it is terrifyingly-fun to watch. The cargo plane breaks apart in the air, (its tail falls off, and it loses its communications system, a propeller, and other vital parts), and does a series of spectacular, computer generated aerial acrobatics, before it finally hits the ground. There's plenty of action, special effects, screaming, and very little blood - almost everyone survives. So here we all are in the middle of the Gobi desert, stranded, surrounded by marauding Mongolian smugglers, lots of hot sun, little food, less water, and a bunch of people in lousy moods.

The Captain, great decision maker that he has proved himself to be, advises doing nothing, even though there is less than a 5% chance they will be found. Elliot steps up to the plate and suggests, in his expressionless voice, that they rebuild the plane from the wreckage. He is an aircraft designer, it appears. Thus, a group of people representing various ethnic backgrounds, religions, countries and social classes, join together in the spirit of survival, with hope and  dreams of a life beyond the Gobi, to build a plane. You may want to avoid this one if you dislike motivational speeches. They are numerous.  These folks will undergo many more trying moments, (along with the audience), including various  weather phenomena, a major explosion, boiling sun, body odor, raiding smugglers, you name it, they've got it!

Look, what do I know? I like foreign art films with subtitles. I did, (surprise!), enjoy moments of ""Flight of the Pheonix,"" so it was not a total waste of time. As I remarked above, Giovanni Ribisi steals the show and his performance is worth the rental. The soundtrack is good. Ummm, the crash was kind of thrilling, and it was nice that almost everyone lived. Watching the rebuilding efforts is entertaining. And the snapshots shown at the conclusion are fun! If only the dialogue had been eliminated......but let's not go there. Don't take this movie seriously. Watch it as you would an action comedy and you'll be fine - unless you prefer subtitles.

""Flight of the Phoenix"" is an update of the 1965 movie, same title, directed by Robert Aldrich, with James Stewart and Richard Attenborough in starring roles. If you have seen the original, you don't want to expect a superior remake here.

2216019,3,B0007KIFIC,"Fight of the Phoenix (2004) is a remake of the James Stewart 1965 original.  Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) is the captain who is hired to transport a crew of defunct oil riggers. There transport plane crashes in the Gobi desert. (Original is Sahara) The surviving crewmembers must find a way out of the desert or die. All of the survivors are taken to desperate measures to find themselves. What would you do in drastic circumstances? Who will survive? Throw in some Nomads and infighting and that is the plot of the film.

This is not an action film. This film gets stuck on the edge of action and drama. Director John Moore takes the middle road, so there is no clear direction for the viewer. The lack of character development takes this film to a screeching halt at times. But Giovanni Ribisi (Elliot) rides his character to the depths of insanity. The technical mind blue print of building airplanes should have been more developed.

The ending is like finding the truth already known. This film is a one time viewing only. The on location editing is consistent with today's technology. (Ooh that's HOT!) The cast is round out with Sticky Fingaz (Jeremy), Tyrese (A.J.) and Miranda Otto (Kelly).",1113868800,,1197,4.7451923076923075
2216020,3,B0007KIFIC,"I generally like Dennis Quaid, but this movie is just blah. Too slow and predictable. It's good enough to watch if nothing else is on, but that's about it.",1113868800,,155,4.379310344827586
2216021,2,B0007KIFIC,"This is a remake of the 1965 classic, starring James Stewart and Richard Attenborough. In this updated version, Dennis Quaid plays Frank Towns, a cargo plane pilot hired to re-locate a group of oil riggers after their drilling site was closed due to lack of oil production. During the flight back home, the plane encounters a sever sandstorm over the Mongolian desert, which forces the plane to crash land.

Towns and his motley crew of misfits must formulate a feasible plan of survival to accommodate their limited supplies that they have on hand. Crude calculations determine that walking to civilization is not a possibility, and waiting for rescue would only allow for 30 days of rationed supplies. However, a peculiar passenger named Elliot played by Giovanni Ribisi devises a plan to rebuild a new plane from the wreckage of their old cargo plane. Thank God that that the cargo plane used by Towns was a Fairchild C-119 with twin propeller engines, or the movie would have ended at the 32-minute mark of this 113-minute escapade. A-n-y-w-a-y-s.....

To make matters worse, a nomad clan of Mongolian marauders stumbles upon wreckage of the plane. In an attempt to reason with these diabolical desperados , Towns and his crew gather the nerve to head over to their encampment; a shootout erupts in which all but one of the miscreants are killed. Guess who returns with friends later in the film? Hmmmmmmmm, ...... I wonder??????

In the end, the film becomes a race against time, the elements, and the Machiavellian horde as to who will prevail. But you can probably figure out the ending for yourself. All in all, this is not a bad film, though it's not a good one either. My suggestion is to rent the original, because you will enjoy it so much more.

2216022,4,B0007KIFIC,This is a review coming from a person who has not seen the original. (Although I now plan to.) The movie was good movie although at times it lapsed into fantasy world. The whole survival method was to only drink one pint of water a day. I am currently living in a desert environment and know for a fact that one pint of water a day is not enough. Still the movie is a good movie and something that is worth the purchase price.,1113609600,,426,4.083333333333333
2216023,4,B0007KIFIC,"Not having seen the 1965 original, I found FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX a durable and entertaining movie.  Beautifully photographed in the South African desert, the movie brings us a motley crew of survivors from a plane forced to crash land due to a sandstorm.  They decide after some time to try and rebuild the plane on instructions from the mysterious Elliott, who says he is an engineer and designer of planes.  (Late in the film, you find out just what kind of planes).  The cast is uniformly good, with Dennis Quaid demonstrating his dependability in any role he undertakes; Miranda Otto who practically stole the Lord of the Rings movies is fine as the token female survivor, but it is the versatile Giovanni Ribisi in his role as Elliott that moves the picture.  A pouty boy-man, he expects everyone to do things his way and he shows no signs of bonding with his fellow passengers.  The movie's pace sometimes lags, but I found it to be a diverting, popcorn movie.",1113436800,,966,4.652941176470589
2216024,2,B0007KIFIC,"I was looking forward to this film but found it far below the original with Jimmy Stewart. Very little time is spent on the actual construction of the new plane and at the end everyone is still in good makeup with barely a sunburn. If you want to see a great survival film, check out the 1965 version - it is far superior.",1113264000,,322,4.126984126984127
2216025,2,B0007KIFIC,"I wasn't a big fan of this movie, it was mediocre to me. I thought the lines (the dialogue) in this were absolutely terrible, and clich of other movies. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, there is no substance in any of the characters. You start to not care if they ever survive their ordeal. It lacked character development. The film is boring and far fetched. It was like the A team crashes in the dessert. ""well we have crashed in the desert.... BUT we have a plane engineer on board, fuel, power saws, welders, and the manpower to make a new plane"" This was just a little too cheesy for me. If you must have an emotional tale of survival, involving a plane wreck, with impossible elements, then stick with the movie ""Alive"" at least it really happened and has detailed character development",1113177600,,801,4.531034482758621
2216026,4,B0007KIFIC,"To tell the truth, I didn't know anything about this being a remake, I thought it was a very good original movie. However since I haven't seen the original i can't say if it is anywhere near as good. I've decided to just stick with the movie that I saw.

The Flight of the Phoenix takes place in the Gobi desert. Actually it first takes place at an oil sight that was supposed to drill for oil, but never found a single drop and now is being shut down. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Towns, a pilot of a cargo plane sent to pick up the equipment and workers of the failed oil drill site.

Mirando Otton plays Kelly [I forgot her last name] who is the leader of the workers and is very angry and defiant of the fact that Towns is almost mocking her of her loss of oil. Tyrese Gibson plays Town's copilot A-Jay, a man with no fear to speak his mind, for example calling the other workers ""Ladies"" since all but Kelly are male, and also confiding to Towns that he thinks they are ""Zeroes""

The plot takes new twists in the early going, with the first that comes in the form of a man named Elliot, played by Giovanni Ribisi. One very unique character, the other twists include a sand storm that has brilliant special effects, with the blade of one of the plane's wings going right into the side of the plane as the sand tore it apart.

The whole plot takes place at the crash site. There are about 13 members left, all ranging from an irish man, to a Latino chef who cooks the food. The crew must deal with one hazard after the other. Ranging from building a new plane, to an electrical storm, to men walking off into the desert one after the other, to finally gun smugglers.

While Quaid and Otto play their parts respectively, it was Ribisi's character that caught my attention. He plays his part so well, even going on to say that out of all of them, only he is indespensable because he is the only one who knows how to build the new plane. I thought the ending of the plane being built had a brilliant new twist that seemed to throw the whole movie another way around.

The gun smugglers don't have much to do with the plot, they do show their impact in the movie, but the ending didn't really need them shooting at the survivors, I thought the take off was suspensfull enough without them. Other than that and a little too much yelling by Quaid's character I would definately reccomend this to anyone who wants to see a solid B movie.",1113004800,,2429,4.269565217391304
2216027,4,B0007KIFIC,"'Flight of the Phoenix' (2004) is fairly faithful remake of the 1965 film of the same title directed by Robert Aldrich.  The remake has the same story; it's about the cargo plane hired by an oil company, which crashes in the middle of a desert.  I remember well when I watched the original on TV long time ago, and the most impressive part is the unique way to get out of the desert.  The method remains the same.  The diffference is, as you can easily imagine, the new version has more actions enhanced by CGIs, and less dramatic tensions between the characters.

The role of the airplane pilot Frank Towns, played by James Stewart in the original, is handed over to Dennis Quaid, and the decision is reasonable.  Becasue a sand storm hits his plane going back to the base, it crashes in the middle of the Gobi Desert.  No radio cantact is possible, and a rescue team is unlikely to come, for the plane is off the usual course.

Reflecting the politically correct trend of today, the list of survivors has one female and ethnically diverse cast including  Miranda Otto ('Eowyn' of Lord of the Rings' saga), Hugh Laurie (daddy of Stuart Little), Tyrese Gibson, and Giovanni Ribisi, who looks exactly like Hardy Kruger in the original.

John Moore ('Behind the Ememy Lines') did a servicable job as director, and you can tell that when you see the film's beautiful shots of the airplane strongly gliding over the sands of the desert (which was actually shot in Namibia, Africa).  The isolated feelings of the desert is shown very effectively from the beginning, and the crash scenes are very good, though not as haunting as that of Ethan Hawke drama 'Alive.'

The story goes smoothly, and the characters (and the increased conflicts between them) are convincing, but compared with the original, in which Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat'-like conflicts between characters played a more important role, the urgency of the survival is somewhat gone in this remake.  Decreasing stock of water must play the integral part to the story, but the characters don't look worried as much as they should, partly because the new script introduced another action factor -- bandits.  Someone please post it, whether there are still such people in and around the Mongorian desert.  By the way this screenplay is by Scott Frank and Edward Burns ... hey, it's the guy Ed Burns in 'Saving Private Ryan' and '15 Minutes'!  And the remake is produced by William Aldrich, original director's son!  Well, if he said OK, it must be OK.

Anyway, this one is not as bad as some critics say, though I don' see the point of remaking it now.  But you can enjoy watching it as good, old fashioned B action, perfect choice for Saturday afternoon.",1113004800,,2704,4.739316239316239
2216028,3,B0007KIFIC,"This movie isn't even as good at the SURVIVOR series, but would make a great backdrop for a future season.  a dozen people are evacuated from an dry oil well and crash in the dessert.  Soon they are all at each other's throats as the water starts to dry up and they have no way out except to build a plane from the wreckage.  For some reason that description sounds a lot better than what the movie turned out to be.  All in all it was a so-so made for TV movie with lackluster performances.  You just wanted to punch the plane designer the whole way through.",1112572800,,559,4.186915887850467
2216029,4,B0007KIFIC,"The original film is a classic-- I can't imagine how difficult it would be to re-create a classic film for a modern audience. Even though this one doesn't quite measure up filmwise to the original (a brilliant character study), I personally like this one more, just for the action.

Dennis Quaid is the captain, who flies into a Gobi Desert sand storm and crash lands hundreds of miles off course. It seems hopeless, and Quaid makes sure all the passengers know it's hopeless too. I wasn't sure he could carry the James Stewart part at first, but considering how this movie is more about the action and situations rather than the people, Quaid is great. (I'm not saying he can't handle a more serious role, but come one! James Stewart??!!) A weird, blonde haired passenger, played by the wonderful Giovanni Ribisi (the reason to see this movie, aside from the action!) says that he can rebuild the plane. After fighting over the possibility, the workload, and the water, everyone finally agrees to give it a try. There's an extra side story in here about nomads, which wasn't explored much in the original. All in all, a very fun movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon.

Quaid and Ribisi star alongside an awesome cast-- Tyrese Gibson (the co-pilot), Miranda Otto (a girl!! I was shocked at first, the original has no girls, but she acts enough like a guy that's it's just fine), and Hugh Laurie (the jerky contractor guy). I wish the characters had been explored more, but hey, the visuals make up for that. Not a great movie, but a good movie-- check it out sometime!",1111795200,,1569,4.6606498194945845

2216032,1,B0007KIFIC,None of the characters or their relationships with one another had any substance.  The tools and resources available to this group were astounding.

2216033,3,B0007KIFIC,"We've seen this trick before.  Come for our AWESOME plane crash then stay for our dreck. The thought being that the people there don't care about plot and characters and things of that nature so why even bother. We saw it with ""Executive Decision"" and ""Under Siege 2,"" and Hollywood never thinks it gets old.  Not that this dreck is all that bad, but it is certainly straight out of the Hollywood playbook.  If they had kept it as a psychological thriller then maybe I could have recommended this film. Rather they felt the need to throw in gun fights and explosions and things of that nature just so that it felt like a real action picture.  Also, the ending was so contrived and predictable that it destroyed any chance I had for liking this movie (what do you think happens when somebody has five chances to do something?).  This movie also had a fair share of other problems.  Some of the one-liners in this film could make your hair curl (""Somebody turn out the lights""). Whoever wrote this should consider themselves lucky that they didn't have to read their own lines out loud in front of a camera.  There was also the much criticized scene in which they play the song ""Hey Ya"" by OutKast. Of course we all know that some overpaid over-educated producer thought that was the best way to appeal to the kids, but they totally botched the delivery of the song.  If they had just played it in the background and left the characters out of it then it could have fit into this little tale of escapism.  However, they had the characters actually listening to it out in the middle of the desert and expending valuable energy dancing to it.  Now we all know OutKast is catchy, but it came off as one big commercial for them in that scene.  On the positive side the acting by Giovanni Ribisi and Dennis Quaid was very good (anybody else find it ironic that Quaid's career is hotter right now than Meg Ryan's?), unfortunately they were surrounded by a bunch of overacting hacks who had no clue as to how to read a line.  There were also some very cool camera shots that work because they fit into the film.  This film wanted to be nothing more than mass entertainment, and I have to give it to them they were pretty entertaining. That is a lot more than ""the Grudge"" can say. However, that can not erase all the aforementioned problems, so I'm not going to recommend it, but only by a hair.  ***",1111190400,,2391,4.441647597254004

A group of people are stuck together in a situation where they need to solve the problem of getting UNSTUCK. Some of the best movies ever made adhere to this old formula. And it usually works, hence it being a formula. I haven't seen the original FOTP, but so what? Maybe I'll catch it on some movie classics TV station. If that movie also entertains, then I'll consider myself lucky again. If you consider the many bad movies you've seen, and compare this movie to all of those...really, the only verdict is a thumbs up. Professional acting, sharp special effects, nice characterizations.

  In ""Languages"" for those with standard tv sets and DVD players, click on ""English 5.1 Dolby Surround"" for sound.

  In Mongolia, Kelly Johnson's (Miranda Otto) oil dig is closing down.  So that quick, Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) caps the oil well and has the plane to load and send the crew home.  The destiniation is Beijing, China (XXVIX Olympiad).

  In flight, a sandstorm approaches.  Frank thinks he can get around it, but this is a great storm.  The plane is too heavy to go up over it.  Parts of the plane is breaking.  The only alternative is to make an emergency landing.  They land in the middle of nowhere. A dessert where the outside winds are 100 miles an hour is enough to blow the flesh right off your face.  Not all passengers survive.  The survivors must find a wat to get out of this location alive.  It's the Gobi Dessert.  If they walk in the bare heat, they are sure to die.  They will sweat faster that what one drink of water can do.  If they fall in a sand dune, they will be lost forever.

  By far, more entertaining than the 1965 version and more factual.  Many differences and twists.

2216038,3,B0007KIFIC,"The main reason to watch a remake like this is to see where they deviated from the original, and where they copied it exactly.  More time is spent on the sandstorm and the crash sequence, both of which are mostly CGI, and hence mostly unbelievable.  The overuse of CGI is becoming a major problem in today's movies.  It ruins everything it touches.  Even when real hardware is seemlessly morphed into CGI, you don't believe the CGI is real; instead, you disbelieve in the real hardware.  The fake somehow manages to ruin the real.

Plotwise, the setting has been moved from the Sahara to the Gobi, although it was shot in Africa (in Namibia).  Quaid stars as the pilot Frank Towns.  The role of the nerdy airplane designer (played by Hardy Kruger in the original) is played by Giovanni Ribisi who, with blond hair, looks very similar to Kruger.  In this version, the Ribisi/airplane designer character has a sinister edge to him, far more so than in the original. Not only is he very calculating (which of course he was in the original film), he is also cold, even cruel.  I guess anyone intelligent enough to design an airplane is not completely human, and certainly shouldn't be portrayed as a normal, trustworthy human being (or at least that's what the people who wrote this script think).

A woman (Miranda Otto) has been added to the cast, but she functions dramatically exactly as a man.  Consciously or not, the screenplay avoids any sexual tension that might be created by the presence of a reasonably nubile female stranded with 10 reasonably healthy men.  The rest of the ensemble cast is simply not as strong as the 1965 version, which included Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Ian Bannen, Christian Marquand, and Dan Duryea.

A missing piece of the ensemble is the outright coward (the British army enlisted man in the original film).  Only heroes on board this airplane.  Perhaps the worst part of the remake (other than the CGI and the inferior ensemble) is the oppressive music, which is obnoxious, constant, and constantly obnoxious.  In the extra features, there are cut scenes and extended scenes.  Why these were cut, I don't know.  They were very helpful as far as plot exposition, and would only have added about five minutes to a movie that clocked in under two hours.  My prediction is that the 1965 version will be remembered long after this version has been forgotten.",1110585600,,2429,4.821256038647343

Among the group we have a man who tells them all that they can reconstruct a new plane and fly out of the desert.  The group decide to give it a try and suceed, but not without sacrifices.

To me, the best parts of the story were the great special effects, such as the sand storms, especially the one that occured during the crash. That was one scary storm and I think they did the crash extremely well. I feel they brought very good human emotion into the movie during the deaths of several of their group and the exteme stress that they were all under.

I actually cheered at the ending, but I wish they had gone a little further and showed the group landing in safety.

2216040,1,B0007KIFIC,"I turned the movie off about the time they decided to build the plane.  I am saddened by the precious moments of my life wasted on this horrible monstrosity of a movie.  The inanities are too many to fully capture, but here's a few observations:

1) As the hard-bitten oil-field workers climb aboard the plane, they suddenly find time to explain their hopes and dreams to each other - something they couldn't possibly have done in the preceding months of isolation in Mongolia.

2) Maybe it made sense in Jimmy Stewart's heyday for a corporate hatchet man to also be the pilot of the oil company's airplane, but it's a little questionable in 2004.

3) When did Dennis Quaid become such a rotten actor?  Or maybe he's lost a bet with his agent.  First ""Day After Tomorrow"" and then ""Flight of the Pheonix"".  Quaid should be hopping mad.

4) No empathy was built for any of the characters.  Rather than pulling for them to survive, they couldn't die quickly enough for me.

5) I'm sure that anyone who was a big fan of Michael Moore would buy the idea that a big-bad Oil Corporation would blithely write-off a dozen employees as ""expendable"".  While I didn't bother to watch to see how this panned out, the anti-capitalist dogma was dripping from every pore of this movie.

6) A flippant comment from the nasty manager type guy makes a humble and manly oil-field worker suddenly question whether he jinxed the plane into crashing. Then when the aforementioned oil-field worker falls down a hill at night and disappears for ever, his good buddies are incensed at the nasty manager for causing his apparent suicide.

7) One valiant oil-field worker is so intent on getting back to his wife & newborn son that he strikes off across the Gobi desert without water.  Dennis Quaid then runs off to rescue this idiot, who then convinces Quaid that it's a super idea to try to build an airplane out of the wreckage of the existing plane.  Something that the dozen odd men standing around the wreckage couldn't possibly do without Quaid's approval.  The inanity of this scene works on so many levels...

In any case, I suppose I deserve it for having confused ""Flight of the Pheonix"" with ""Flight of the Intruder"", and not having bothered to read the back of the DVD jacket.  Still, if anything good came out of this it was an interest in seeing the original, just for further evidence on how far Hollywood has degenerated.",1110326400,,2411,4.643867924528302

2216042,2,B0007KIFIC,"Macho, muscles, six-packs, hot-shot attitudes, and a real cool crash scene. That's the good part.

I was really looking forward to a kind of ""Junk Yard Wars"" type movie that went into great detail on how the old damaged plane was torn apart and rebuilt from the scraps.  But in this I was greatly disappointed.  Most of the work took place off camera, and the few scenes we did see were sketchy and didn't make much sense.

Example: They are about to put one of the wings in place, a tricky task no doubt, but for some horribly unexplained reason there is a difficult job that only the company chef can perform. Why the chef? What is the job? We are never told! He is handed a big chunk of metal that looks like a huge spike and told to crawl into the fuselage, and in the process of lowering the wing into place, some chains snap and the wing slides down prematurely, seemingly crushing the chef. Then two seconds later, he emerges unharmed from behind a pile of rubble, everyone cheers, and he jokingly asks for a new pair of pants. End of scene. There are way too many scenes like this one that leave you wondering ""Huh?  What in the world just happened?""

Okay, so we're not going to learn, bolt-by-bolt, how the plane was rebuilt.  But at least we get a good, in-depth, drama type film that goes into detail on the characters, right?  Uh, sorry.  Wrong.

Each of the characters falls way too easily into pre-cut stereotypes. Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) is the Han-Soloish pilot who by default leads the group, and of course rules more by yelling and bravado then compassion and understanding.  Rady (Kevork Malikyan) was meant to be the beautiful female lead, but she wasn't that beautiful and her lead wasn't very strong.  All she's good for during the entire movie is one little ""Hopes and Dreams"" pep talk to Frank.

By far the most enjoyable character is Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi), the psychopath, self-inflated nerd who designs planes for a living.  Yes, it might have been nice to know more about why this guy suddenly found himself in the middle of the Gobi desert at an unproductive oil field at the exact moment it was being shut down and the employees flown-out.  But over looking that (and so many other glaring holes in the story) the reason he's fun to watch is because he's more then a paper-thin cutout whose every move is predictable. We KNOW that Frank Towns is going to go into the desert after the idiot who runs away out of desperation.  We KNOW that Randy is going to give Frank the ""you-can-do-it"" pep talk when everything looks impossible.  We KNOW all the buff guys with giant shoulders and flat abs are going to give each other lots of high-fives and dance on the wings of the plane.  But Elliot keeps us guessing, and might even salvage what would have otherwise been a total loss of a movie.

All in all, it's a fun little story that's enjoyable to watch, once.  But it's also full of scenes that are only half complete and so lacking in detail I can only chalk it up to laziness on the part of the screen play writer, the director, or both.",1110240000,,3072,4.481149012567325

I don't like remakes. I feel there is enough fresh material out there that remakes are not necessary. That is, of course, a personal assessment.

The movie follows the plot of the original. A plane takes off from an oil field and crashes into the desert. The survivors construct a plane out of the debris.

Where do I start. The film has one great scene and that is of the plane crashing. Thats it. After that we get one bad scene after another. We never get to know the characters like we do in the original. They seemed more forced in this version. There are some lines pulled right out from the orignal but they cant save this trainwreck, they are delivered so badly its embarassing. When the plane gets buried in sand the passengers dig out not only the plane but the surrounding area as well but it looks like they manage to dig out a HUGE area around the plane that would take bulldozers a week to dig out. Theres a stupid scene where the passengers start dancing to a song on a cd player. These guys have just crashed, low on water, working day and night to build a plane and they are goofing off dancing? Dont even get me started on some of the life speeches in this film. I also got a good laugh after the film they put pictures of the characters and what they did after they were rescued.

2216046,4,B0007KIFIC,"This movie had my son on the edge of his seat--twice. For the grown-ups in the audience, the film is best if you haven't seen the original and know little about the film when you go in. Although you know at the beginning how things will work out, the film is full of surprises, and I won't spoil them.

Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) punches into the opening with a double-barreled cargo plane to shut down an oil rig in the Gobi desert. The crew on the ground, headed by equally tough female geologist Kelly (Miranda Otto), is none too pleased. Knowing themselves to be out-of-work, within a short time, they dismantle the rig piping, load it aboard and take off, with an extra, Eliot (Giovanni Ribisi), who appears as they're about to take off, and asks for a lift.

Before long, the plane runs into a huge Gobi desert storm, and despite Eliot's warning that the plane has too much drag to lift above it, Towns decides to take his chances. Corporate officer Ian (Hugh Laurie) clings to his seat while rig hand Alex Rodney (Tony Curran) rattles about the cabin telling the rest of the crew to sit tight.

The predictable crash-landing is action packed and realistic, taking off the rear of the main cabin fuselage and one passenger with it. Upon landing, the remaining crew discover they have lost two others, who died in their seats.

The best of the film is watching the conflicts between the remaining men, whose collective self-esteem is so low they call themselves ""garbage."" Jeremy, aka Patch (rapper Sticky Fingaz), Sammi (Jacob Vargas), Liddle (Scott Michael Campbell) and Rady (Kevork Malikyan) go along with Eliot's plan to rebuild one of the twin barrels into a fuselage. All a man needs is love, says Liddle, and if he doesn't have that, he needs hope, and if he doesn't have that, he needs something to do.

This movie gives the family something to do, and teaches the value of brotherhood and human spirit in the process. See it with your kids.

2216048,4,B0007KIFIC,"The Flight of the Phoenix is an exciting remake of the 1965 movie of the same name that, while not as good, is still a very good movie and well worth a watch. When an oil well goes dry in the Gobi Desert, pilot Frank Towns must fly in, close down the well, and fly the crew out of the desert. On the way home, the plane crashes during an enormous sand storm in the middle of the desert. Stranded hundreds of miles away from the nearest civilization, the survivors decide to try and build a new plane out of the wreckage of the crashed plane. As they attempt to build a new plane, the survivors must battle dwindling supplies, horrific weather conditions, themselves, and a murdering band of nomads. As well, there is an excellent twist toward the end which is that much more enjoyable if you haven't seen the original. This is a beautifully shot movie with plenty of great panoramic shots and good special effects, especially the sand storm and the subsequent plane crash. Even though it didn't do well at the box office, Flight of the Phoenix is an exciting, well-made movie that will keep you interested throughout.

Dennis Quaid stars as Captain Frank Towns, the pilot who crash lands his plane in the desert and must find a way to survive. This year hasn't been a great year for Quaid with two box office flops, this and The Alamo, but in both movies he gives very good performances. In a very good supporting role, Tyrese Gibson plays Towns' co-pilot, AJ. Giovanni Ribisi is perfectly smarmy as the mysterious Eliot, the plane designer with a secret who thinks he can rebuild the plane. Miranda Otto, the lone female in the cast, holds her own as Kelly, the leader of the out-of-work oil crew. The other survivors of the crash include Hugh Laurie as Ian, Tony Curran as Rodney, rapper Sticky Fingaz as Jeremy, Jacob Vargas as Sammi, Scott Michael Campbell as Liddle, and Kevork Malikyan as Rady. The DVD offers widescreen presentation, commentary with director John Moore, 15 minutes worth of deleted/extended scenes(several of which are pretty good), and the ""Phoenix Diaries,"" a very good, informative look at the making of the movies. While this remake is not as good as the original from 1965, it is still an exciting movie.

2216049,4,B0007KIFIC,"FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is a good Hollywood film that balances special effects with human-interest storyline and succeeds in making the viewer root for the right thing - the importance of the 'brotherhood of man' concept that allows survival under extreme circumstances.

The story starts rolling immediately with Frank Towers (Dennis Quaid) and his rasty co-pilot AJ (Tyrese Gibson) landing a big galumphing airplane in the Gobi desert to pick up the crew of an oilrig station in the process of dismantling.  No sooner are the resentful crew being evacuated aboard than a massive desert dust storm forces the plane to make a quasi-crash landing in the middle of the Gobi desert.  What to do when isolated without contact with the outside world in a crisis situation with limited water and food and little help for survival?  Well, rebuild a new airplane out of the debris of the crashed one under the direction of the lightly zany model airplane builder Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi)!  Power struggles abound, people try to escape into the desert, outside marauders threaten, storms abound, but eventually the 'Phoenix' (new name for the rebuilt plane) rises from the flames and the surviving crew hold on for their flight to freedom.

No spoilers here: you know from the beginning what will happen. But it is the getting there that makes this otherwise overdrawn story work.  The crew includes actors of fine caliber such as Miranda Otto, Tony Curran, Jacob Vargas, Hugh Laurie, Scott Michael Campbell, Kevork Malikyan, Jared Padalecki, and Sticky Fingaz (AKA Kirk Jones who adds a huge dollop of eye candy to the film!).  If the various characters are not subtly drawn, it is more the fault of the hasty script than the actors' abilities.

Could the movie have been better? Sure, but it doesn't try to be any more than it is and that is just good entertainment.  The sense of people bonding for the greater good is stated clearly enough without making it sappy.  The special effects are excellent, and if you are a fan of the natural sculptures of the wind carved desert sands, then this is a film that will please you. Taken for what it is, it is easily a four star recommendation. Grady Harp, March 2005",1109980800,,2202,4.829787234042553

I have never seen the original, so I cannot compare the new version to the old.  But I can say for sure that this film had some very good parts and some very bad parts.

Let me give you some examples of what I loved and hated about this movie:

#1.  Giovanni Ribisi turns in one of his best performances as Elliott, the stranger who hikes along for a flight out of a shutdown oil rig in the desert.  Ribisi is excellent as the mysterious tag-a-long.  His character is also one of the few who seems to have intrigue with his personality.  Almost all of the other characters are extremely one-dimensional

#2.  The movie was too simple.  There was no twist or sudden event that made this movie grab the viewer, with the one exception of a secret about Ribisi's character.

#3.  Dennis Quaid, playing pilot Frank Towns, just seemed a little flat in this movie.  It was almost like he didn't want to do this film.  At least that's the impression I got.  If you watch him in The Rookie and then watch this film, you'll see what I mean.

#4.  Miranda Otto, playing the role of Kelly, managed to be both strong and feminine like no other actress I have seen lately.  She was so good in her role that I almost forgot she was a fictional character in the film.  She put forth a much better performance than half of the cast.  I am going to see look at her filmology to see what other movies she has been in - her performance was that good!

#5.  The plane crash itself was very believable.  A few years ago I was on a plane that ran into severe turbulence.  Granted, we didn't crash - the experience made me respect the way the director went about making a very realistic presentation.

All in all, I will probably not buy this film.  But I did enjoy watching Giovanni Ribisi and Miranda Otto turn in great performances.

2216053,3,B0007KIFIC,"Flight of the Phoenix is two stories: a dismemberment and resurrection of an airplane that mirrors the dismemberment and resurrection of the castaways.  Good enough, but what is it's relevance today?  And why would we bother seeing this movie, as opposed to renting or re-releasing the original.

This, I cannot answer. It was a good film for what it was, but was it necessary?  This question is its own answer.

Another problem besides the ""Why are we here?"" question, is the ""What are we doing?""

For example, there seemed to be too many characters for the story.  Each person got about two lines in to reveal themselves, but we see nothing more that pale stereotypes.  One is a young Mexican chef, who is the twerp of the group.  Another is the evil CEO, the Sith Lord indirectly responsible for all moral evil in the movie.  Another gives an oddly out of place anti-organized religion speech (""Religion divides, spirituality unites"").  What does this have to do with the dismemberment and resurrection of the plain and the characters, much less the plot?

Miranda Otto is a potty-mouthed sex symbol-her script does not take much beyond this pigeon hole.  Too bad, since she did so well in ""Lord of the Rings.""  Her babe-age factor triples when she is in orc armor.

I suggest that the look at the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series, ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"" or even the earlier ""Seinfelds.""  Each character has a specific thing they are doing, a specific task they are to perform.  It adds tediously to the story and helps tighten the writing up.

The CG special effects, are stunning, especially the fragmentation of the crashing plane-the next step from ""The Phantom Menace's"" pod race crack-ups.  But SFX cannot drive an entire film. They just frame the plot and enhance the storytelling.

I don't think this movie is worth the full ticket price-borrow your neighbor's DVD, or catch a matinee.  It is a good rainy-day movie, despite all my criticism.",1109030400,,1967,4.811940298507463

2216057,2,B0007KIFIC,"**1/2 ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is at best a so-so remake of the fine Robert Aldrich adventure classic from1965.  The plot in both films is fairly simple and straightforward.  After a plane crash lands in the Gobi Desert, the survivors hit upon the notion of rebuilding the damaged vehicle in the hopes of flying it back to civilization.  Dennis Quaid assumes the role, originally filled by Jimmy Stewart, of the pilot who, against all odds, endeavors to lead his passengers to safety.

Although the new version follows the original fairly closely in terms of both character delineation and plot development, the story doesn't seem quite as fresh today as it did when we first encountered it close to 40 years ago.  Perhaps what's missing is the guiding hand of a master craftsman like Aldrich to really deliver the goods (John Moore, a far less distinguished director, is manning the controls here).  This ""Flight"" feels awfully predictable and rote, as we plow our way through each of the various survival threats, rescue attempts and internecine personal conflicts that are standard in all such tales of survivors stranded in a hostile environment.  Each of the characters steps out of the shadows to have his or her own Moment in the Sun (yes, in this version, there is actually a woman aboard), before receding dutifully into the background to allow the next person to do the same.  About the only intriguing element in the story is the fact that the main character, the pilot of the plane, has to actually be talked into participating in the Quixotic rescue plan.  Thus, he is a leader and a hero more by default than by design.

Although the crash itself is fairly impressive from a technical standpoint - despite a rather phony-looking, computer-generated sandstorm that brings the plane down - once we end up on the desert floor, the movie doesn't do a particularly effective job conveying the truly grueling nature of the predicament these individuals are facing.  We never really get the sense that they are just a few water droplets away from dying of thirst or heatstroke.  Moreover, the feat that they are able to accomplish seems barely credible - from a sheer mechanical engineering standpoint - given the lack of resources and expertise with which the group has to cope.  The main weakness with a film like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is that, when the plane goes down, we're stuck in the desert right along with the characters, and if they don't have anything particularly interesting to say to one another, we can feel just as stranded as they.

Thus, despite a few quality moments, this ""Flight"" never manages to get off the runway.  Check out the original instead.",1104969600,,2679,4.844298245614035
2216058,3,B0007KIFIC,"John Moore's remake of the 1965 original FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX restations the tale from Africa's Sahara to the Gobi of Mongolia-China. There, pilot Frank Townes (Dennis Quaid) has for the last time flown out to an isolated oil outpost run by a tough woman named Kelly (`The Lord of the Rings's Miranda Otto). When again underway and en route to Beijing, the plane meets with a storm ... and Townes, disillusioned by the prospect of having to turn around and refuel, climbs higher. Very quickly we begin to realize that the small craft wasn't built for the turbulence - bolts, panels, and propellor come loose. Not to mention a little handy instrument known as a radio. Chugging and sputtering, the plane falls from the sky, downing itself in an endless expanse of sand dunes. The survivors are faced with a choice: wait and hope that someone might happen to find them, or rebuild from the wreckage. Among the desert's most formidable enemies (besides heat) are electrical storms, sand devils, inconvenient explosions, and smugglers.

Previews, and for some the original version (unseen by me), would appear to forecast much of the plot: plane goes up, plane goes down, team appears impossibly stranded, team rebuilds. Director Moore salvages the movie from what would have been its single remaining point of appeal (basically, who survives) by adding useful surprise elements along the way. I shall leave most of them unlisted ... but it will serve our purpose to note that they provide good suspense, examining choices and possibilities: what could happen and, in retrospect, what should have happened. The main theme - ""give people hope"" - does not look terribly underdeveloped, but the characters (most of whom lack complexity) could have brought it out more richly and thoughtfully.

[Warning: Spoilers Below]

Generally speaking, the acting is mediocre. The only exception is Giovanni Ribisi, who lands a chilling role as Elliott, the cold and calculating Long Beach-based model airplane designer. That's right - MODEL airplane designer (a fact that, in going undisclosed for the great majority of the rebuilding process, nearly gets him killed). After viewing his performance, Ribisi would have been a perfect cast for the role of Nicolae Carpathia in the LEFT BEHIND movies. He is, at times, actually scary as the chief antagonist ... reminding me, on occasion, of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter - minus the cannibalism, naturally. Specifically what made Elliott `scary' was his unpredictability: both in mood and behavior, which added to the uncertainty about the course of the plot, and by way of that, the outcome.

There is some talk about God and things spiritual, and while most of it doesn't require treatment here, one statement necesitates pointing out. One of the men - it is difficult to tell whether he is East or West Asian, but he is Asian - remarks, ""Religion divides. Spirituality unites."" I hope for the producers' sake that this guy was speaking out of a chiefly Western mindset. Because, if he was not, the question presses: Why would the screenwriters feel compelled to forge a dichotomy between religion and spirituality and put it in the mouth of an Eastern individual? It is widely true that the distinction between the two is not so great in other parts of the world; in many places of the East `religion' and `spirituality' can be perfectly synonymous terms. In addition, the statement itself is more than a bit trite. The speaker imparts only the slightest fraction of meaning to the spirituality in question, with the phrase, ""a belief in something."" Here, as in other Hollywood productions, these abstractions have become another example of postmodernity's bashful ambiguity on the subject (which belief? what form of spirituality? and whose?).

My only other concern was: What were we to make of Elliot's callous act of murder? Moore seems to leave that up to the viewer. Having done so leaves the film lacking in sense of closure. That does not have to be a bad thing. But in this case it was handled poorly; what Moore gives us was unrequested, undesired. While we don't sense at all that the party might turn Elliott over to authorities in Beijing, we are left with mixed feelings about his persona. Once again, that might have been okay, if it served a greater purpose or role within the movie (such as imparting wonder, enriching the `message', or empowering the mood); but here it appears to be there merely for its own sake.",1104796800,,4463,4.961229946524064

You pretty much know the plot if you saw the previews. There's a plane crash in the desert and the survivors realize they have little chance of rescue. They're too far from civilization to attempt to walk out, so they figure they're doomed -- until one person (Giovanni Ribisi's character) comes up with an idea: ""Let's build a new plane from what's left of this one!"" It sounds farfetched (and probably is), but that's what they eventually attempt to do.

The previews lead you to expect that they will somehow succeed, so all the suspense comes from wondering which of them will make it back to civilization. Ribisi's character is so socially challenged and outright annoying that his chances start to look grim about halfway through.

There were a few harsh scenes during the crash sequence and when the survivors encountered hostile locals, but no sex or nudity. There is probably a fair amount of adult language, but it didn't jump out at me so it mustn't have been too bad. Overall, a good, enjoyable movie.",1103500800,,1110,4.682051282051282
2216061,5,B0007KIFIC,"Saw it Saturday at the Bridge theater in Culver City.  In one word, my review would be, ""awesome.""  I remember when I was a boy my dad taking me to see the old Robert Aldrich movie ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" at the tiny Kings Park Theater on Long Island.  That as so long ago James Stewart could still play an action hero.  I loved the picture then, and I think a lot of boys my age still will connect the movie with similar male-bonding experiences with their dads--maybe they should have released this re-make during Father's Day holiday instead of Christmas.  Anyhow, the remake did not disappoint.  Dennis Quaid is no Jimmy Stewart, but he's just as good in this as he was in THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.  Funny in this one he's always traipsing up and down over Gobi desert hills in Gunga Din heat sweating his balls off, whereas in TOMORROW he was all icy cold with ice forming over his face.  What a year it's been for poor Dennis Quaid.  In this film he plays Frank ""Shut Em Down"" Townes, a crack pilot who makes some unfortuante decisions early in the film and spends the rest of the time living them down and trying to righten things.

Miranda Otto looks completely different than she did in the final two films of the LORD OF THE RINGS tragedy.  She plays Kelly, a tough as nails oil driller and physically she looks a lot like Evangeline Lilly who plays ""Kate"" on ABC's LOST.  Everyone around me sitting in the theater was commenting on how much this film resembles LOST.  Frank and Kelly are just like Jack and Kate in LOST, there's a quasi-Sayed guy who spouts a lot of mystic Kahil Gibran philosophy, a chubby guy sort of like Hurley, and strange monstrous creatures out there who are using the castaways as target practice.  And of course, there is the shadow of the wrecked plane spilling out over the sands.  But THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is not a rip off of LOST, rather, the resemblance is the other way around.  Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat its lessons, but for today, my tip is, if you like action pictures and don't mind the constant burning sun, see this film and try to figure out what twists and turns are coming next.  And also, even if you dislike Giovanni Ribisi in other movies, don't let us casting here prevent you from seeing this film, because he shows another side of himself here and will really win your heart despite playing such a loathsome, racist, lying, manipulative and sociopathic character.",1103500800,,2448,4.489841986455982

2216063,3,B0007KIFIC,"Seldom has a movie tried so hard to be exciting, and failed so completely, as ""Flight of the Phoenix.""

It huffs and puffs, explodes and burns. It conjures up computer-generated sandstorms, lightning and scary desert people on horseback. Dennis Quaid squints. Miranda Otto rages, then smiles prettily.

""Flight of the Phoenix"" isn't boring, but it isn't as gripping or suspenseful as it could have been. It wilts in the shadow of the original ""Flight,"" a 1965 adventure starring James Stewart and Richard Attenborough.

The original movie used to be in heavy rotation on AMC (before the channel dumped its classic-movie format to chase younger viewers), and it still had the juice to rivet a viewer to the couch no matter how often it played.

This new millennium ""Flight"" mostly repeats the same story arc. Cargo plane pilot Frank Towns (Quaid) and co-pilot AJ (Tyrese Gibson) fly to Mongolia to pick up an oil exploration team. A fierce sandstorm rips apart the plane and forces a crash landing in the Gobi desert.

Frank wants everyone to sit tight, conserve precious water and wait for a rescue that might never come. But the arrogant and mysterious Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi) thinks of a so-crazy-it's-brilliant idea for saving them. Ribisi is usually a wonderful character actor, but his Elliott isn't nearly as twitchy or layered as he should be.

Otto plays token tough chick Kelly, who is angry about her team's evacuation but later warms up to Frank.

One annoying thing about ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is that no one seems to be suffering much. You could argue that the oil crew is used to the climate, but they're not used to working with almost no food and water. It's hard to feel concern about people who are bravely enduring mussed-up hair and stained clothes.

The phoenix is a mythical bird that was consumed by fire, then rose again in a new life. Sorta like a Hollywood remake. But in the case of ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" the new life is a cheap copy of the original.",1103241600,,1984,4.763848396501458
2216064,1,B0007KIFIC,"Typical Hollywood.

They can't think up anything new and original so they remake a classic with more money and effects, stick some current wannabe good looking actor types in ( aka Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis types ) and update & ruin a powerful original script.

What will hollywood try and do Next,

A Remake of Psycho with Ann Heche playing the lead or something. Oh wait they tried that,....rolling eyes.",1102118400,,406,4.771428571428571
2216065,4,B0007KIFIC,"This is the first review that I have done of a product, sight unseen, unless you count that exciting trailer currently shown in theaters.  To contrast the other reviewer, the ""political correctness"" of the film appeals to me.  There is a woman, a couple of African-Americans, and the always-reliable Dennis Quaid.

The comparison between the Stewart original and this remake is inevitable.  The same ""complaint"" was made when Denzel and company remade ""The Manchurian Candidate"": the logic lies behind remaking a classic.

Musicians often take classic/ standards songs and reinterpret them, adding their singular take on those made famous by others.  Why shouldn't moviemakers be any different?

My money is betting that Quaid, Tyrese Gibson, and Giovanni Ribisi, another actor that I have admired since he appeared on an episode of ""The X-Files"", will score at the box office in this survival drama/adventure.

December 22nd can't come soon enough for me!",1101513600,,956,5.28476821192053
2216066,2,B0007KIFIC,"Is there any other explenation to give rather than to say this IS sort of an advertisment for the old movie? I was thinking about it. And that's what I came up with.

 If you were a big fan of the old ""The Flight of the Phoenix "", I don't know if you'd give this a nice warm welcome. The specail effects might be amazing, but why take a good and great movie and reinact it?

 I should point out, that in the old movie there were no woman [and Im not saying it because it botherd me, or something like that] but in this one there are. I think it is trying to be politicaly-correct.

  I know my dad, who is a big fan of the old and great ""Flight of the Phoenix"" wouldn't enjoy this movie..",1096502400,,688,3.9420289855072466
