I remember watching this movie in the late 80s or early 90s, and I loved it then.  Still love it now, so last year I got it from Amazon.  They just don't make action, drama movies like this anymore.  If you buy it, you won't be disappointed....IF you are a movie buff like myself.  HAPPY WATCHING!",1408406400,,318,4.526315789473684
