For the very reason the previous reviewer said not to, to show my sons and grandsons what people like Bill Bennett actually say about black men in general. Current pop culture killed the revolution ""...like they did my man Fred Hampton"" and the billboards say come and play come and play. Secondly Charlie Rose is a trustworthly journalist, he meet his intent for having Bill Bennett appear...Bill Bennett has said a lot worst things about Africans and Africans in America, Do yourself a favor buy this DVD and judge for yourself.",1240531200,,610,4.764150943396227
8148872,1,B000J3EZ7C,"I was totally disappointed with this DVD.  It was described as a review of the Million Man March.  There was not one speech or actual footage of the Million Man March, coincidentally, which was what I was seeking and the main reason why I ordered this DVD. Bill Bennett got his rocks off talking in a condescending tone about what African Americans should think or not think about Louis Farrakhann and what the Million Man March stood for, the audacity.  However, it is typical of many WASP, in thier warped minds, they feel that they have a right and a moral compass to tell everyone what they should think or what they should feel. Very disappointing!!!  Don't purchase this DVD if you want to see footage of the Million Man March.  If you want to see the Charlie Rose show, featuring Bill Bennett ranting and raving about what Black people should think and who they should support,throw your money away and purchase it.",1201651200,,922,4.631901840490798
