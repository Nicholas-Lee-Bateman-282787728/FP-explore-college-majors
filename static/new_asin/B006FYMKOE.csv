8497234,1,B006FYMKOE,"I ordered it by mistake and sent it back (didn't even open the seal) in fact I mailed it back in the same package it was sent it, but am still waiting on them to receive it and refund my money.  I did however see the film when I streamed it online and what a waste of money.  It was horrible, so I'm glad I didn't keep it.  I read the book The Big Picture by Douglas Kennedy and thought since this movie was a screen adaptation of the book, that it would be decent.  It wasn't.  And the ending??? What's up with that???? That ending came out of left field. It started off decent enough only to veer into something unrecognizable of the book and not even good drama.  Save your time and money and skip this and maybe opt for reading the book.",1458259200,,741,4.075862068965518
