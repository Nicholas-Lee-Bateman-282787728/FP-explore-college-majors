2748102,4,B000MTFFO0,"There are no rays of sunshine in ""The Dead Girl"".  There isn't one character who isn't tragically flawed; instead, the film presents an unbroken chain of murky, polluted existences.  Few of the characters even exhibit a potential for improving themselves or their lives. The movie is almost beyond depressing, because it's all too real.

Within this web of misery, there are some strong acting performances. Old pros Piper Laurie and Mary Beth Hurt portray grasping, whiny matriarchs.  Toni Colette shines as a trampled flower of a character, a shy woman who hides a masochistic streak.  And Brittany Murphy--yes, the much-maligned Brittany Murphy--is extremely good as the hard-living murder victim (seen in retrospect).

Director Karen Moncrieff purposely dispenses with all the cliches that allow viewers to vicariously enjoy ""serial killer"" flicks.  There are no super-monsters like Hannibal Lecter, pursued by heroic FBI profilers.  Instead we get a pool of unrelenting squalor, and the characters who swim through it, trying to stay afloat.

In the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, ""Human, all too human.""  Those looking for virtue need go elsewhere.",1182470400,,1153,5.426966292134831
2748103,4,B000MTFFO0,I really liked this movie.  I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once.  Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.,1180742400,,257,4.446808510638298
2748104,5,B000MTFFO0,"I'm stunned that I had never heard of this excellent film until discovering it by accident (on a friend's coffee table while housesitting). What I thought might be an intersting little drama actually turned out to be a powerful, devastating and engrossing film. Filled with powerhouse actors, this film shows the affect a vicious murder has on a variety of people, from the stranger who discovers the body (Toni Colette), to the dead girl's naive, devastated mother (Marcia Gay Harden) to the doomed, damaged girl herself (Britney Murphy). Every one of the film's vignettes is both brutal and tender, filled with stories of desperation, sex, death and redemption. This is easily the best film of its kind I've seen since ""Monster's Ball"". Why didn't this film get more attention? It deserves it.",1180656000,4,795,5.03030303030303
2748105,1,B000MTFFO0,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was depressing to watch and the story was very poorly written.  All of the ""segments"" were left hanging and never actually came together at the end.  There was nothing shocking about the ending, it just ended.  I had to double check to be sure that was indeed the credits rolling.  What a jip, I want my money back.  I foolishly bought this movie without seeing it first thinking it had to be good with all the known actors and the description on the back sounded good.  Boy was I wrong!  I threw it in the garbage, the first movie I have ever thrown away.",1180483200,5,603,4.228070175438597

2748107,4,B000MTFFO0,"I wouldn't have bothered to view this film if Rose Byrne's name weren't on the package. Dark, forlorn stories with bleached-out photography ain't my thing. But from the first vignette (of five) about two stringy-haired, lonely women, I was gripped.

In that first part, a young woman's body has been found. The first four parts tell of its effect on various people. The last and weakest vignette tells of how the young woman got dead. The journey in each of the first four follows an unpredicable course. Each maintains a funereal tone. And they are chock-full of incredible actors who can match Rose Byrne in quality if not in loveliness.

Too bad the writer didn't manage to maintain that tone or unpredictability thru the last chapter. It's full of clichs screeched at the upper decibels. If it weren't for that, I'd have been forced to give this grim movie 5 stars. Boy! That was close!",1179532800,,890,4.735483870967742
2748108,4,B000MTFFO0,"This was a very depressing movie just in the subject matter: the cruel murder of a young tortured soul. The movie itself is in five parts which is told from the point of view of the different characters in the movie. ""The Stranger"" revolves around Toni Collette who plays Arden, a homebody &  plain woman who is caring for her emotionally abusive aging mom, played to great effect by Piper Laurie. Arden finds the 'dead girl' and takes the necklace on the corpse as her own treasure. She also engages in some creepy conversation & sex with a guy she met at a grocery store, played by Giovanni Ribisi.

""The Sister"" is about Rosie Byrne who plays a sibling who is tortured by her parents' continuous grieving for a sister abducted 15 years ago. She also works in the pathology lab, and thinks the ""dead girl"" could be her long-lost sister. She plays someone who is desperately seeking closure and an end to the endless hope of her parents [her mom is played by Mary Steenburgen].

""The Wife"" was the most chilling part in the movie...it centers around a woman who is loud and abrasive and whose husband goes on mysterious trips out of town and they both manage a storage place. She takes over for him on one of his trips, and makes a startling discovery in one of the storage spaces, which in turn leads to an interesting if morally questionable decision on her part.

""The Mother"" focusses on Marcia Gay Harden who plays the mother of the ""dead girl"" and her grief is very palpable and touching to watch. She takes the initiative to trace her daughter's last residence and meets Kerry Washington, who plays a hooker and drug addict who was also her daughter's best friend/lover.

""The Dead Girl"" takes a look at the last hours in the life of the victim, played convincingly by Brittany Murphy [one  of her best performances so far]...the last frame was truly chilling to watch.

Overall, I found this to be a compelling movie with a tightly-woven plot. The excellent casting added to the emotional depth of the movie and each character was convincingly fleshed out. A worthwhile addition to the thriller genre.",1179360000,11,2110,4.640750670241287
2748109,2,B000MTFFO0,"this movie doesn't suck, but its not good either. my first problem with it are the titles given to the stories in this movie. these aren't necessary, they're annoying, and the stories should just fade to black when they end (and fade in when the next one begins). we can guess who the characters are without the title descriptions.

the second problem(s) with this movie are the choices that these women made, specifically with their bodies. i believe these poor choices are what link these women/stories together, not so much the Dead Girl. hypothetically, let's say the ""stranger"" DID NOT find the dead body. she'd still be an adult recluse, who's forced by her abusive mother to take care of her, and has no concept of what ""real love"" is, so she agrees to go out with a man she's never met and allows this serial killer obsessed-creep to tie her hands together so that they can have sex. i can't begin to tell you what's wrong with that woman, but doesn't she have enough sense to stay away from a guy who only talks about killers and victims? couldn't he be a/the killer?

next is the ""sister"", who's medicated and depressed about her missing sister. she works with a guy, who obviously likes her, for 3 years, and she's never gone out with him. all of a sudden, she goes to one of his parties, has sex with him, and ignores his phone calls. those are the actions of a depressed person. the entire movie could've been about her and her parents in their never-ending quest to find their daughter/sister.

then there's the wife of the suspected killer. when she finally puts 2 and 2 together about why he leaves her all time, she doesn't turn him in! does she still love that creep? i don't mean to ruin the movie, but she gathers all the evidence, burns it (!), throws the clothes that she's wearing in the fire(?!), and walks away naked. is that supposed to be symbolic? that's crazy and stupid (plus she's like 60 years old, nude).

finally, you got the dead girl, not to mention her lesbian lover/co-worker. of course, they're prostitutes. the messed up thing is why the dead girl became a prostitute, because her mother turned a blind eye to the stepfather's sexual abuse of the girl, which led her to escape to california. the mother tracks down her last known whereabouts and finds her daughter's ""friend"" and the grandchild she didn't know about. i guess the only good thing that happens in this movie is a grandmother will raise her dead daughter's child the ""right"" way, probably to make up for her past mistakes.

as a man, i adore women. but if there is any advice i can give, based off this movie, is to keep yourself sexually pure for as long as you can. if you're abused by anyone, especially a man, you fight them off and tell someone about it ASAP. if you don't, you might end up as a drug addict, prostitute, or in abusive and/or unfulfilled relationships for the rest of your life. or you'll just be killed, like the dead girl.",1179360000,8,2949,4.51498127340824
2748110,5,B000MTFFO0,"Karen Moncrief has written and directed this terrifying, searching, agonizing, and exceptionally fine story of the responses of five different people to the discovery of a dead girl.  By dividing her story into chapters named after The Stranger, The Daughter, The Mother, The Wife, The Sister, and The Dead Girl she offers us fully realized characters, each of whom is affected by the opening discovery of a mutilated young dead girl's body. The technique of non-linear film is not new, but Moncrief raises it to a new, powerful level, a fact that makes this film one of the more sophisticated and successful of the past few years.

Arden (Toni Collette) is a homely frail girl who accidentally discovers the dead girl, taking a necklace from the corpse before reporting the discovery to the police.  She is a caretaker for an invalid, foul-mouthed cruel mother (Piper Laurie) who berates Arden for being so ugly and for involving them in a murder case.  Arden flees, meets The Stranger Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi), a tattooed, scary appearing guy who is attracted to Arden because she appears so innocent.  He courts her with tales of serial killer manners and yet eventually gains Arden's fractured self-perception trust with physical contact.  The next chapter introduces Leah (Rose Byrne) who works with Derek (James Franco) in the mortuary where the dead girl's body has been deposited for autopsy.  Leah discovers markings on the dead girl that convince her this is the sister who has been missing for 15 years, a fact that her parents (Mary Steenburgen and Bruce Davison) refuse to accept. Leah's tenuous hold on reality is altered by Derek's consolation and physical attention.

The Wife episode offers a view of Mary (Mary Beth Hurt) and Carl (Nick Searcy), a married couple with mutual distrust: Mary knows Carl has flings with prostitutes while Carl feels Mary is too controlling.  Mary discovers  a chest of torn bloody underwear in one of their business Storage Containers, connects the items with Carl in a suspicion that Carl may be related to the death of the dead girl, and burns them.  In The Mother we finally meet the true mother Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) of the dead girl Kritsta (Britanny Murphy) as she traces the clues from the body to a seedy motel where she meets Rosetta (Kerry Washington), Krista's roommate and lover, only to discover that the dead Krista ran away from home to become a prostitute and drug addict in response to a childhood abuse problem with her father. Melora is informed that Krista has an illegitimate three-year-old daughter Ashley whom Krista loved and Melora seeks to care for the only remains of the dead girl - her granddaughter and her lover.

This film beams with brilliant performances: Collette, Harden, Byrne, Laurie, Hurt, Searcy, Washington, Steenburgen, Franco and Ribisi are poignant in their depiction of damaged people whose lives are altered by the Dead Girl.  This is ensemble acting of the finest category.  The production values are strong and the director's control of what could have been a meandering saga is firm and keeps the story from becoming sensationalized. This is yet another brilliant little film that deserves a very wide audience.  Grady Harp, May 07",1179360000,17,3231,4.990689013035381
2748111,4,B000MTFFO0,"An amazing all star cast show off serious acting chops in a dark drama/thriller told in segments and concentrating on different points of view and experiences revolving around the death of a young woman.  Harrowing, moving, and suspenseful, the films draws a sudden and suprising conclusion that is both realistic and  shocking. A great character piece that paints complicated portraits of its character both both good, bad, and neurotic. I would describe the film as being very dark but told with such conviction and lack of heavy handiness that it's also very entertaining.  Toni Collete as always gives an incredible performance alongside quasi walking legend Piper Laurie, Mary Steenburgen, Giovanni Ribisi, Kerry Washington, and many others including stand out performances by an amazing Mary Beth Hurt and a right on target Brittany Murphy (nobody does almost-insane and/or drugged out better than her).

2748135,5,B000MTFFO0,"When I saw this movie for the first time, it was mostly the acting that blew me away.

On subsequent viewings, and I've seen it now at least 7 or 8 times, it's the structure of the film that makes it unique.  I know there have been other films with seemingly separate vignettes pulled together, but most are strained and can't really pull it off.  Pulp Fiction is one other that can.  This film manages to do it seamlessly.  And each vignette is wonderful in its own right.

Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie, Rose Byrne, and Kerry Washington are all amazing.  But it's Mary Beth Hurt and, especially, Marcia Gay Harden who steal this film.  Marcia Gay Harden just breaks my heart.  This is acting at its finest.",1454112000,,723,4.542635658914729

2748171,4,B000MTFFO0,"The Dead Girl (2006) is a thoughtful and poignant film that features five separate stories that are all related to a single event, the murder of a young woman.  Written by Karen Moncrieff, the stories resonate and touch the heart to varying degrees, while mostly reflecting a female point of view.  The sensitivity of the writing and the meaty characters, are no doubt why the film garnered such a superb cast, and contains such deep and emotional performances.  While there are more than a few convenient coincidences, and some segments are stronger than others, the overall story holds together nicely, and presents a unique perspective of a tragedy.  Most who view the film can't help but be touched to some extent.  (Some mild spoilers follow)

The story is told non-chronologically, and begins with ""The Stranger"", where a woman named Arden (Toni Collette) discovers the dead body of a woman on the farm where she lives with her invalid mother (Piper Laurie).  After being interviewed on the news, Arden becomes something of a celebrity, a fact that results in only scorn and criticism from her tyrannical and controlling mother.  Arden's notoriety leads to her being asked on a date by Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi) a mildly creepy supermarket clerk, which in turn opens a whole new page in both Arden's and her mother's life.

Coincidence plays a major factor in ""The Sister"" as Leah (Rose Byrne), a medical student working in the medical examiner's office, believes that the dead woman is her sister, who mysteriously disappeared some 15 years ago.  Leah's family has never recovered from the tragedy, an event that still weighs heavily on them all.

In ""The Wife"", Mary Beth Hurt plays Ruth, a woman who discovers evidence that her husband Carl (Nick Searcy), who runs a warehouse storage business, is a serial killer.  When Ruth confronts him, he admits nothing.  Now Ruth must decide what to do.

There are probably few, who would not be truly moved by Marcia Gay Harden's heartbreaking performance as Melora Kutcher in ""The Mother"".  Harden plays the mother of the dead woman, who has been identified as her daughter Krista.  Looking for some closure Melora visits the dingy apartment where Krista lived with her roommate Rosetta (Kerry Washington).  The crushing emotional burden of knowing that her daughter was murdered and left naked in a field, gets even heavier when she learns from Rosetta that Krista was a prostitute.  One more shock is coming her way, when she discovers that Krista was the mother of a little girl, who is now alone in the world.

""The Dead Girl"" brings the story almost full circle, as we follow Krista (Brittany Murphy) on the last day of her life.  She has bought a doll as a birthday present for her daughter, who is staying at a nearby town with a sitter.  It's too late to have the doll delivered, so she plans to get a ride and deliver it personally.  The nature of Krista's relationship with her roommate Rosetta is clarified, as at the end of a tumultuous day Krista finds herself hitchhiking in need of a ride, when Carl happens by and picks her up.

A multi-faceted tale that revolves around a sad tragic event, The Dead Girl pushes a number of emotional buttons, as Karen Moncrieff's terrific screenplay brings forth a number of powerful performances, with Marcia Gay Harden, Mary Beth Hurt, and the late Brittany Murphy, perhaps shining the brightest among them.  The Dead Girl is hardly a feel good experience, but is a film is well worth your time.",1327104000,,3495,4.825503355704698
2748182,2,B000MTFFO0,"The film should have a warning label.  Anyone struggling with depression should not watch this movie.  Few movies about serial killers are happy affairs, so what's the problem?  It would seem that every character is in some stage of being off kilter beginning with the gruesome opening when Arden (Toni Collette) finds the decaying remains of a young woman in a field near her home.  She is shy and intimidated by the attention and publicity given her.  A clerk in a grocery store asks her out on a date, but is freaked out when Arden suggests he manhandle her.  This opening act is followed by 4 more (I think) where the characters are linked to the dead girl.  Although I'm not familiar with the writer/director Karen Moncrieff, even casual movie goers would recognize the cast:  Piper Laurie, Giovanni Ribisi, Rose Byrne, James Franco, Mary Steenburgen, Bruce Davison, Mary Beth Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Kerry Washington, Brittany Murphy, Josh Brolin and others.  Obviously the actors trusted Ms. Moncrieff.  How else do you get Collette doing the ""full monty"" and a nearly 60 year old Mary Beth Hurt going topless?

This is conflictingly what is right and what is wrong about the film.  Each actor is brilliant and manages to chew up their role, small though it is in all cases.  At the same time, I felt like I was watching individual performances rather than a cohesive story.  There's nothing wrong with the detachment of the characters and how they ultimately fit into the dead girl premise, it's just that so much information is missing along the way.  I did like the chapter where Hurt's character discovers her husband's secret.  Her response and her ultimate plan of action were creepy and interesting.  While the parts are very good, the whole of the movie is just a little lacking.  Now, where's my Zoloft?",1324857600,,1820,4.816129032258065

The Dead Girl is a very strange movie and I hated it. It is a movie about different people and how all of their lives are somehow interconnected. A girl is murdered and a woman finds her in the back yard, then she gets in a fight with her mother, goes off and meets a random guy and has sex with him?. Next scene is a girl who works in the morgue where the dead girl's body is taken, and she sees a birthmark resembling that of a sister of her's who went missing years ago. The parents don't believe her and then it turns out it isn't the girl's sister. Then it moves on to the mother of the dead girl coming and identifying the body, which leads her to her estranged daughter's girlfriend and they are both prostitutes who live in a nasty hotel. She finds out that her daughter had a child and goes and gets the little girl. Then there is the scene about the creepy old couple who live in a house near their storage shed business and while the husband is gone the irritated wife finds a dresser in an empty storage unit full of dead women's clothing. She bags it up drives to the police station, sees a cop, then takes it home and burns it and her own clothes, and walks away back to the creepy murderous husband naked! Then at the end there is a flashback scene to how the girl met the killer (old creepy man) while hitch hiking because her loser pimp? boyfriend wouldn't take her to give her daughter a present. Then when the scene comes that the dead girl and murderer are in the car together it just ENDS!! So basically you waste all this time and it ends in such a random spot....I hate this movie and it was a waste of money renting it.",1238803200,8,1824,4.226361031518625

2748202,4,B000MTFFO0,"THE DEAD GIRL is an interesting new take on an exhausted genre.  Since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS nearly 20 years ago, we have been bombarded with the serial killer in film over and over.  Sometimes something good like SEVEN comes along, but most of the time its by-the-book blood and mayhem that only gives a lame story a convenient excuse.  Oh, it's a serial killer.

In this movie, we travel back and forth in time to see how one really messed-up girl's murder affects friends, family and total strangers.

If two of the stories had better conclusions (not easier, just better), I would've given this movie 5 stars.  The first one, THE STRANGER, is interesting and definitely well-acted...but it just stops, it doesn't end.  I wanted to know more.  I was hoping for something better for her.  Same for THE WIFE.  Mary Beth Hurt plays a middle-aged house frau who watches her sinister husband go out night after night, leaving her to keep their miserable, loveless lives going.  She thinks he's just frequenting prostitutes...until she finds a dresser filled with bloody trophies like slashed underwear.  (I didn't even know it was Ms. Hurt until the end titles!  I remember lusting after her as the girlfriend/wife from THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP back in '82!  She really becomes this sad character in this movie.)

I guess the complaint I have is that these two stories didn't give me enough of these characters.  And I wanted more.

The other stories are filled with authentic performances and gritty details.  Unfortunately, I knew a girl just like The Dead Girl.  Fortunately, she pulled it together...and survived the streets.  But she could've ended up like the girl in this movie.

You never see The Dead Girl's murder.  Or see Ashley Judd or Morgan Freeman heading up the investigation to bring the killer in, or any investigation, for that matter.  But you do see how far reaching a senseless murder can go and the damage it does beyond its sad victim.",1236643200,4,1963,4.776785714285714
2748203,4,B000MTFFO0,"When I rented this movie I didn't realize it was the stories of different women and how one murder links them all.  It begins with Toni Collette as a shy caretaker of an abusive old woman.  When she finds the body of the murdered woman she is shocked and fascinated.  She realizes that life is too short to be sitting in one place letting other people make you feel worthless and she acts.  The movie continues with the ME preparing the body.  The ME thinks that the dead girl could be her missing sister.  Her life and that of her family has been frozen since her sister went missing.  Her parents won't accept that their daughter might be dead.  This weighs heavily on their remaining daughter who only wants to get on with her life, but this obsession with finding her sister overwhelms her.  We also get to meet the dead woman's mother, her roommate, and the dead girl herself.

2748205,5,B000MTFFO0,"Short Attention Summary Span:

1. There is a girl who is found dead by a caretaker. It turns out that the caretaker has an abusive mother, and finding the dead girl is a catalyst for her moving out and starting her own life.

2. It was initially thought by a family that the dead girl was their own (long missing daughter). It turned out to not be-- but this was not enough to stop the surviving daughter from bringing closure to a long and painful ordeal.

3. From there, we move to an unhappily married husband and wife. The husband disappears for long periods of time with no explanations. It happens just by chance one day that the wife finds that the husband is killer by fortuitous discovery of the evidence that he has kept for his crimes. She does not report him to the police and burns the evidence.

4. The movie then goes into the mother (of the murdered girl) going back and finding out what kind of life her daughter lived-- and what drover her away from home. Along the way, she finds that the daughter had a child-- that she decides to keep.

5. Finally, we get to see the events leading up to the death of the girl (her life as a prostitute) and it is proved that the man that we saw earlier was indeed the killer.

Comments:

This was a brilliant film. Brillant writing and brilliant acting.

1. There were several plots and several resolutions, but they were introduced one at a time. Many movies that have several subplots make the resolutions all at once in the end. But these resolutions were made at the end of every vignette and that made for a refreshing change.

2. The film was obviously lower budget, but the acting and writing made up for that. (This is as opposed to a lot of films that have a high budget that can't cover up a crappy plot.)

3. There were a lot of unresolved elements-- which was somewhat unsatisfying. But on the other hand, the fact that these existed prevented the movie from being hackneyed.

4. The acting was generally very strong and the characters were well cast and very believable.

This is worth an evening movie ticket.",1233360000,2,2078,4.425196850393701
2748206,5,B000MTFFO0,"THE DEAD GIRL takes the typical serial-killer movie and turns it inside-out. Rather than show us the eeevil stalkers and the bloody mess they make, TDG allows us to witness the aftermath. We are given five separate tales showing the effects of murder on family, friends, and total strangers. Brittany Murphy (Sin City) is the doomed title character, Marcia Gay Harden (The Mist) is her devastated mum, Jerry Washington plays her girlfriend, and Josh Brolin is her boyfriend. The rest are strangers who are involved in the story in various ways. Toni Collette (The Night Listener) finds the body. Rose Byrne examines it. Mary Beth Hurt is married to the hollow-soul who just might be responsible. Giovanni Ribisi (The Gift) Mary steenbergen, Piper Laurie (Carrie), and James Franco round out the cast. With so many movies that make serial-killers out to be unstoppable, homicidal genius' and / or anti-heroes, (which I fully admit to enjoying), It's refreshing to see the actual pain they cause and the lasting effects of their actions. I also like the few rays of hope within the hopelessness here. Though some lives are destroyed, others are reborn.

The characters in The Dead Girl were just too pathetic and unhappy. No one can relate to these people; well I couldn't.

This movie is reminiscent of 'Wicker Park'. It tells a story from a number of vantage points without ever losing the base plot. Very difficult deed! And very well executed.
Other reviewers have gone over the plot, so I won't do that. I will say that every actor is in prime form, I honestly couldn't pick one from the other as far as contributing their skills to this movie. The photography, sets, music/sound.... it all comes together here!
The story is absolutly intriguing and gripping. I was taken in with the first vignette, with Toni Colette who is one of my favorites. The story never loses pace and branches out in a decided and careful manner as to complete the telling and bring everything full circle.

Though the actors were brilliant, the screenplay intelligent, and the music stirring, I felt the story was disjointed.  I couldn't fully get a handle on what the writer was trying to say...until it was over.

When it ended (and the ending came sooner than I wanted), as I watched the credits, listening to the eerily beautiful music, I thought about every character in the movie and how much I had been emotionally moved by nearly all of them.  How much more I wanted to know about them.  How strange that I felt that these people had so much more to say and at the same time I knew that they had said as much as they could.

The story wasn't disjointed, it was perfectly laid out and, yes, the film was quite extraordinary.  I can't stop thinking about how amazing this would look on a live stage.

The Dead Girl needs to be watched twice, at least.  Be careful though, it has the ability to suck you down into dark places that aren't so easy to climb out of.

The lonely woman who finds the body is abruptly liberated from her drab existence. The forensic examiner too is liberated from her own demons after her examination of the body. The toughest story to take, for this reviewer, is the tale of the murderer's wife who cannot bring herself to report the crimes she knows her husband committed despite her unpleasant life with him - she will enable him to continue his miserable activities - a baffling & disturbing enigma. The mother of the victim fearlessly seeks the truth about her troubled, lost daughter's life including the shocking discovery of why the girl left home in the first place. Above all the best segment is the last... the actual experiences of the victim during her last days alive.

A well acted, dark & mysterious movie... a bit depressing yet there are small rays of hope. The story's ending is not quite ""wrapped up""... nothing's finalized, but rather what happens next is left for the viewer to imagine.

Not good to view if you're looking for something uplifting - it shows too much of the seamy side of life. A good movie if you want a unique murder mystery.",1211846400,4,1244,4.675799086757991

2748229,4,B000MTFFO0,"The blurb on this DVD jacket implies the movie is a forensic science mystery. This is very misleading. Don't get this movie if that would be your sole interest in it. Yes, a body is discovered here, and there is a scene or two showing the Medical Examiner probing the corpse for clues. But these scenes are minor moments in the film. This movie is essentially about the transformations wrought in the people surrounding the dead girl.

It's all women who are shown being touched by the death. So for some viewers, that might skew this movie in the direction of being a ""chick flick."" But the film is actually in a genre all its own, beyond classification.

In the sort of flat commentary that's included in the bonus materials, filmmaker Karen Monrieff steers us to the conclusion that these are stories about redemption. She suggests that the transformations catalyzed by the girl's death are all positive ones. One proposed subtitle for the film is: ""One Life Ends; Six Others Begin."" I'm not so sure about that though.

All the women depicted do start from utterly bleak places. Possibly the worst condition of initial entrapment is seen in the vignette starring Toni Collette and Piper Laurie. Laurie plays the ultimately controlling mother who is grinding her caretaking daughter into dust in the suffocating closeness of their dingy, curtained house. When Collette is the one to discover the dead body in a nearby field, the resulting notoriety she gets brings her into contact with the outside world. Specifically, it brings her the attentions of a store clerk who has a morbid interest in serial killers. The two unworldly, childlike adults tentatively work their way towards a romance.

However, it's difficult to be convinced that this will be a turn-for-the-better for Collette in the long run. Her boyfriend seems to be all too fascinated with the details of serial killings. One gets the feeling she might be exchanging a metaphorical entombment for a literal one.

So while I don't find all these vignettes to be necessarily life-affirming, I did find them all to be absorbing and worth watching. The final vignette tracing back to show the dead girl's fate is especially touching.

The acting is realistic and inspired throughout. But the photography is truly brilliant. Much of the drama is filmed using appropriately dim lighting. But then a unique outlining effect is used at key moments. The actor's faces are limned in light. They become silhouettes, unknowable quantities hung against a universal background glow.",1192233600,,2534,4.992890995260663
2748230,4,B000MTFFO0,"I was at first put off by the title and premise of this film, but after reading so many positive reviews from credible sources, I thought I would give the film a look.  It is definitely a film you have to be in the mood for, and you will most likely be in a mood for a while after seeing it.

 It is a film divided into 5 stories whose respective main characters - on the surface - seem to have no direct relation to those in the other stories, yet they all do have a connection to the central plot which is interwoven into each of the stories.

The first story deals with the incidental discovery of the title character's corpse by Arden (Toni Collette) who is a lonely and socially handicapped care-giver for an abusive relative (Piper Laurie) whose sadism and cruelty is limited only by her physical disability.  During the course of her mundane and miserable day, Arden also achieves two other relatively significant (though still somewhat troubling in their manner) milestones in her otherwise bleak and dismal life.

Another chapter features a medical student (Rose Byrne) working a shift in the Coroner's office.  When a young woman's corpse turns up at the morgue, there are indications that lead the med student to believe that the body might be that of her long-missing sister, who disappeared when they were children.  Her need and efforts to find out the truth of the matter becomes a consuming obsession with her own emotional well-being at stake.

The next vignette features a dysfunctional couple - presumably married (though possibly common law) - whereby the woman (Mary Beth Hurt) is alternately a passive-aggressive nag and whining martyr-wannabe and inveterate enabler who is annoying from the get-go.  The man (Nick Searcy) is a no-account, shiftless loser with a penchant for impromptu, late-night travels that last for days and offer few details.  Although his mannerisms are less grating and more reserved than hers, there are eerie inferences that he may possess another side to his otherwise banal disposition.

The fourth story features a woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who has been informed that the body of a young woman found dead has been identified as that of her daughter.  The grieving woman travels across the country from her small town to the seedy and lurid underbelly of the big city.  It is during this heartbreaking trek that she begins to take on the role of ad hoc gumshoe, in order to find out as much information as she can about her deceased daughter.  During the course of her inquiries, she discovers that she has a granddaughter who she then becomes determined to find.

Finally, there is the last vignette featuring a young woman (Brittany Murphy) who is in single-minded, reckless pursuit of two quests of very different purposes and natures.

The characters in the film are a departure from the standard Hollywood fare of likable, affable, and heroic protagonists.  Of these, only the dead girl's mother is one the audience can really connect with and feel a sense of empathy as well as sympathy towards.  She is not necessarily imbued with any particular strengths or exceptional character traits, but she is a decent and compassionate person who has suffered a great deal, first from the news of her daughter's death and then from the revelations about her daughter's life.  A few others - such as the father (Bruce Davison) of the missing girl, and possibly the co-worker (James Franco) of the missing girl's sister - could also possibly be considered likable, though the audience really doesn't get much of a chance to know them.  A few others can be considered sympathetic, such as the missing girl's mother (Mary Steenbergen), whose efforts to maintain a seemingly incessant (if not convincing) air of hope for her missing daughter still being alive have an almost oppressive effect on her other daughter's efforts to accept the tragedy and begin the slow and painful but necessary process of healing by accepting and moving forth.  It is a strange but coldly pragmatic paradigm in which the sister's hopes and optimism hinge on confirmation of her sibling's death rather than embracing the remote possibility that she may still be alive.  These two women can be considered sympathetic, but this is most likely borne out of our empathy for them rather than any particular virtue they display.

Other characters invoke ambivalence at best, such as a creepy convenience store clerk (effortlessly played by Giovanni Ribisi) who in spite of his interest in serial murder cases and trivia, is the only source of positive attention (relatively speaking) that Arden seems to receive.  Although one is inclined to feel pity for Arden's deplorable situation, she also tends to alienate the audience with her own considerable personality shortcomings.  Another character who doesn't quite seem to inspire sympathy or enmity is Rosetta (Kerry Washington), a junkie & prostitute whose nihilistic outlook and self-destructive lifestyle have reduced her soul to a mere husk.  The remaining characters in the film evoke utter contempt or outright abhorrence for their despicable lack of morality and/or their actions which run the gamut from appalling to horrific.

Finally, a mention of praise for Brittany Murphy.  She portrays a very different type of character than what she has done previously, although it is ironically just a minor supporting role.  Yet, for those of us who have always liked and remembered Brittany Murphy for her familiar combination of quirky humor and offbeat beauty, this role is a big departure which pays off as a gamble for displaying her range of characters and acting ability.  She even undergoes such a different physical appearance for the role that it takes a fraction of a moment to remember that it is her and not another actress.  Her character in this film is not a likable or even a very sympathetic one, although she is not completely without a potentially redeeming quality.

This film is well made, in terms of both technical competence and artistic merit.  The writing and direction are skillful.  The acting is effective, and in some cases engaging.  However, it is more thought-provoking and emotionally evocative than it is likable.  Due to the brutally unsentimental content and thoroughly depressing nature of the stories, this film's appeal may be limited.

In fact, it is a film that will be more likely appreciated rather than enjoyed.",1188518400,,6427,4.98314606741573
2748231,4,B000MTFFO0,"Several seemingly unrelated individual vignettes culminate to form THE DEAD GIRL, including a piece on the victim herself.

Her mother is livid about Arden's find and just wished that she'd left the dead girl alone without telling anyone about her. There is an unseen tie between Arden and her mother (played by Piper Laurie), but the death of an infant (probably Arden's) is quickly surmised. This ""other death"" eats at Arden and her mother's relationship, feeding guilt to one and anger to the other. Arden's celebrity status (""That's the one who found the dead girl"") also peaks the love interest of Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10th-and-Wolf/dp/B000GDH9N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10th and Wolf</a>), a town local who soon learns how mentally damaged Arden really is.

The effect of the dead girl is then transferred to the medical examiner's office where we meet Leah (Rose Byrne,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later</a>). Leah (an M.E. herself), along with her mother and father, have yet to come to grips with the disappearance of Leah's sister some 15 years earlier. Leah believes the dead girl to be her long, lost sibling while her mother and father (especially her mother) refuse to believe it. The family tension is palpable here and much credit must go to director Karen Moncrieff for ""keeping it real.""

We then run into Carl (a distant husband played by Nick Searcy) and his wife Ruth (Mary Beth Hurt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>). Ruth is terribly embittered because of Carl's absences, and she believes her strong religious philosophies are being tested when she finds some disturbing clues as to Carl's activities while he's away. It is Carl whom you want to keep a close eye on throughout the film.

The discovery as to the dead girl's true identity is finally meted out and her mother, Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) comes to I.D. the body and discover why her daughter ran away from home. Guilt, shame, fear, and redemption await those who stick it out and finish watching what happens to Melora as she learns the truth behind her daughter's roughshod life and what lay beyond her final resting place.

And then we get to meet Krista (Brittany Murphy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet/dp/B000QI2ZWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet</a>), The Dead Girl herself. Interlocking all the other storylines with Krista is a pretty phenomenal piece of cinematic work, and it is done effortlessly. The connections are made in whiplash quick fashion so watching the final segment may take a few viewings before all watchers actually ""get it."" Krista's prostitute life is not relegated to ""the hooker with a heart of gold"" cliche. She is not the best person to hang around with, but she is a ""real"" human being who makes poor decisions, good ones, and one, final, fatal choice.

The Dead Girl is not a thriller. It doesn't show the murder nor have men with chainsaws jumping out from behind trees to cut-up our nearly naked victim. It is a slow immersion into the terrible lives of these messed up folks. Don't get me wrong: this film isn't without tension. It has PLENTY. It's just not the type your sixteen-year-old will be used to and will probably fall asleep watching.

The ensemble cast, I think, speaks to how motivated the actors were to do this project and make it an effective piece of cinema. All of the cast were spot-on in their character portrayals and it is these characters that drive the entire production.",1186099200,18,4413,5.72824427480916
2748232,4,B000MTFFO0,"Written and directed by Karen Moncrieff, this film tells a darkly disturbing story about the murder of a young woman. Told in five separate episodes, each with a different point of view, the film represents murder not as a plot device but as something closer to what it is in actuality - a brutal ending of a life with an impact that reaches far beyond the victim and in unexpected ways.

As  written by Moncrieff, much of the film is about tortured and deeply conflicted relationships between mothers and daughters. Performances are provided by a cast of mostly seasoned actors, the most moving of them being Marcia Gay Harden, who gives a devastatingly understated portrayal of the victim's mother. While all the episodes are unnerving, perhaps the darkest is the gradual revelation of the killer. The DVD includes a director's commentary, plus short interviews with the director and several cast members.",1185753600,,907,5.0

2748234,5,B000MTFFO0,I really liked the unusual way this story was done. I like movies that make you think. I feel the characters were portraied perfectly by the actors excellent cast. Very different! Wendy,1183593600,,185,4.8125
2748235,4,B000MTFFO0,"I'll admit that I only bought this movie because James Franco was in it. I do enjoy his looks, but he is a strong actor that has intrigued me over the years. That being said, his part wasn't the biggest, nor was it the best. He did the best he could with the part given, but his segment (the movie is divided into 5 segments) was mainly focused on Rose Byrne's story. She gives an excellent performance, likely the best in the film.

The 4 remaining performances, all centered on women, are held together by strong female performances. I found Toni Collette's part to be the most emotionally touching, and Brittany Murphy does a good job as well. She was a bit over indulgent at times, but I have always admired her acting skills. This movie was no exception.

Overall, the movie was pretty depressing. The story was moving and engrossed me, but I can't say that I would recommend it unless you are a die hard fan of one of the actors. The plot is interesting, but the acting is the real story.",1183420800,,994,4.396739130434782
2748236,5,B000MTFFO0,"Picked up this movie because of the known actors, had no idea what it was about whatsoever. Just like everyone else's review you have five different stories that all revolve around the dead girl. This movie has excellent acting, depressing stories and overall brilliant ideas. I could see some people not wanting to watch a depressing movie but this one was right up my alley. I would say that everyone I know would love this movie. I haven't seen Crash yet but I hear this is similar as far editing and I hear Crash is a great film. I you're into movies that have multiple stories going on try 'Go' or most Tarentino films. This film is not for minors due to nudity, violance, drugs etc.",1183075200,,688,4.468253968253968
2748237,4,B000MTFFO0,"It's weird to figure out where this film hooked me in to watch it. Normally I like more independent films but sometimes there just so awful and ""boy-are-we-smart"" attitudes that you feel like the more you roll your eyes, the more they'll pop out of your sockets. ""The Dead Girl"" is one of those kind of films where it really shouldn't work and yet everything fits right but not quite enough. There's nothing inherently wrong with the story but it's like performing a long piano piece and hit 2 bad notes, it's like ""argh, so close!""

The movie opens with Arden (Toni Collette) discovering the body of a young girl, Krista (Brittany Murphy) dead in a field. Krista's mother (Marcia Gay Harden) is in town trying to find her as well as finding out some surprising news. A body believed to be Krista's is found by a morgue assistant (Rose Byrne) who's been looking for her sister for years. Krista's killer is slowly being found out by his wife (Mary Beth Hurt).

There's different segments to the film and they're all played one at a time so it doesn't suffer that Crash format of having everyone somehow passing by each other. While the characters are all connected, it's not presented in this sort of implausible fashion that really only Robert Altman films can pull off. However, that means that each segment relies on the strength of where it is in the running order and how well done it is. For example, the ""Sister"" segment centering on Byrne is definately my favorite yet the previous segment, ""the Stranger"" which focuses on Collette is kind of boring.

The acting though is by-and-large excellent. There's some that are surprising (I always found Rose Byrne underrated yet nobody listens to me) while some are just obvious standouts such as Toni Collette but she's always good. Strangely, the one weak link is the titular character played by Brittany Murphy. Of course, the whole idea of a drugged out/messed up girl doesn't seem like a stretch but sometimes she's almost all over the place, being quietly reflective and subtle than she turns on the hysterics and kind of goes overboard. Sure she avoids the Sean Penn style of overacting but it's kind of distracting. The other I felt was James Franco as the lab assistant who gets involved with Byrne. He didn't feel like someone she should find comfort in since he almost seems more like someone who'd rather keep her in his bed than be a friend.

It's probably not a film for everyone. While the indie crowd would love it, it's one of those out of the way films where you'd almost have to overexplain what the whole thing's about. It's best a film you discover on your own or word of mouth and whether it interests you than some guy saying it's ""best movie of the year!"".",1182643200,2,2731,4.636363636363637
2748238,3,B000MTFFO0,"I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, and for most of its duration, it lived up to its billing.
It jolts you from the start when a lonely caregiver stumbles upon the gruesome corpse of a young woman. The movie has segments which describe other women who are, in some way, linked to the victim. These segments are well-acted, poignant, but brief perspectives of each woman's life, and for a moment this looks like it might become one of the truly great movies of recent years. And then the end sort of leaves you hanging, and wondering. It feels as if the characters are seeking closure, and yet closure is not something you think of when the movie is over.
This is the movie's only real flaw, though. It is beautifully scripted, written, and acted. Ah, if only...",1182643200,5,768,4.613138686131387

In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims.  If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it.  In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm.  This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.

Watch them suffer!  On second thought, don't!  The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.

I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.

2748240,5,B000MTFFO0,"Absolutely the most remarkable piece of cinema I've seen all year, and one of those rare gems that gives us reason for hope - there actually are brilliant directors and cinematographers out there even though they toil in the fields of low pay and unrecognition. As other reviewers have mentioned it seems unbelievable that I'd never heard a word about this film... but of course I know much more than I need to know about Spiderman 12 and Pirates of the Caribbean 9, all of it drilled into my skull every hour of every day for weeks.

There's not a note of music, a sound, a line, an expression or a bit of body language in this deeply moving film that doesn't ring true. Welcome to the real Los Angeles.

Karen Moncrieff deserved or deserves an Oscar for Best Director, and I doubt there's any film that can match this one for such unfailing brilliant performances by an obviously dedicated cast.

If you're serious about films, don't miss The Dead Girl. It's a hard one to shake off.",1182556800,21,985,4.522471910112359
2748241,5,B000MTFFO0,"In the past year I've watched The Junebug, Vera Drake, and then the Dead Girl. All three movies are tremendous character studies. The Dead Girl is uncompromisingly dark. There is no comic relief, no moments of hope. The shock of the movie is the beginning scene, and from there the movie moves slowly down to its inescapable ending.

Most of the characters are drowning in their inability to cope with their lives. One woman in a miserable marriage destroys evidence that would implicate her husband in a hideous crime. She would rather continue living with this monster than be alone. Another woman who shows great kindness to others is married to a child molester. A third character showers her daughter with unbelievable verbal abuse. The seriously flawed and failing woman who is the dead girl comes across as one of the few likable people in this film.

Most of these people are sinking in the quicksand of life. Yet this is a fascinating piece of work, and the actors are masterful. If you enjoy this movie (is ""enjoy"" really the right word to use?) you should also see Junebug, and Vera Drake. Don't see all three at one time, though. You might have to start taking anti-depressants.",1182556800,,1190,4.743961352657005

8172259,1,B000MTFFO0,"I fully admit getting sucked in by the ""powerful performances"", ""powerful performances"" and reputation of Toni Collette. This movie was disgusting. It was nothing more than a horror story dressed up in a drama so these actors would ""sharpen their acting chops"". If you watch the interviews surrounding it you clearly see it. I guess I have to watch those now to determine if I watch a film. This movie is so over the top contrived to be gross while throwing in there a little smack in the face of Christ and Christians that it is revolting.

The movie is a movie. But it is split into several segments with their own title . . . ""The girl"" . . . ""The mother"" . . . ""The wife"". . . . I guess that and that alone is supposed to make it ""art"". Not. But the premise is that some weird crazy girl who lives with her weird crazy invalid mother is out running and finds a half decomposed body of a girl in their field. The entire scene is disgustingly weird. She meets an equally weird guy and they sit around talking about mass murders of girls as they give strange eerie looks. Just horror movie antics. Then you find out who the girl was. Basically a messed up druggie prostitute who had a kid. The mother of this dead girl shows up and finds out she has a grandaughter that was abandoned by the prostitute mother, living with a bunch of hispanics in squalor and poverty somewhere in the slums of LA. The grandmother takes the kid with her. She tries to get her daughter's prostitute friend to come with her but she refuses. We learn the daughter ran away and abused drugs and her body because she was sexually abused by her step father. So then we see the wife of the man who did this (and other things to other prostitutes). Instead of turning her husband in she burns the evidence and goes to bed with him. We see their fighting and the woman, who is supposed to be a Christian, quoting scripture as she shows herself to be a hypocrite. But somehow the idea is not that she is a hypocrite and giving Christians and Christianity a bad name but that she is one of ""those"" . . . a ""Christian"".

The movie from start to finish is graphic in the scenes, characters, language, and ideas it depicts. Just leave it in the past and save yourself the mental attack of some profane hollywoodite trying to be the next big thing.",1462924800,2,2315,4.307339449541284
