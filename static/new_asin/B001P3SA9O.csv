3737233,4,B001P3SA9O,"`Passengers' is one of those schizophrenic films that seems to have been written by two different writers (Ronnie Christensen alone). The basic plot premise is that Claire Summers, (Anne Hathaway) a psychologist, tries to help half a dozen airplane crash survivors cope with post traumatic stress disorder. Now, personally, from the beginning, I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end, but hold still. The ending is a must.

The middle portion of the film is full of medical interviews and sessions with various survivors of the crash who seem to all have different memories of the incident, different feelings and different reactions. This part is mostly filler with each patient strangely disappearing as the film progress. There are too many `gotcha' moments like phones ringing in the middle of the night, newspapers flapping at Claire's face in the wind, barking dogs that won't go away, people jumping off roofs in front of Claire that were just `goofs', a faked drowning, etc. There is tons of symbolism. There is even a fake conspiracy that fills time. Then there is also the obligatory love scene between Claire Summers and Eric (Patrick Wilson) as a creepy guy turned amorous. It's just a pack of things you've seen before.

However, in the last 15 minutes of the film, you start to catch on with each character's life and it really turns out to be quite moving. You understand why each person was in the plot and what they were and what they turn into. The final moments are very touching as everything comes together and there is a good feeling of satisfaction. Its not perfect, but it does make for a good sleuthing film and a good date movie.",1242432000,,1666,4.78125
3737234,5,B001P3SA9O,"This film is so derivative, seemingly and elementally that I was confused because I knew the whole story and so I worked on what I didn't know, In a desperate attempt to enjoy it. Just as I was beginning to cop an attitude, it all made sense. Not the story, but the product...it's romantic cover story with a mystical horror surrounding. Add the cast, mild-stylish direction, decent effects, Twilight Zone-'like' style with a plane wreck and here's a winner.
Blu-ray A/V high quality, world rocking sound at moments when not , immersive in a quiet way.",1242345600,2,552,4.760416666666667
3737235,4,B001P3SA9O,"Have to completely disagree with the put-down reviews below. This was an excellent and moving film with a very strong performance from Anne Hathaway inparticular. Be careful what you read below - one reviewer gives away the whole plot (why people do this in reviews I'll never know...). The film does leave you wondering what is really going on and it is NOT predictable. People tend to say this AFTER they have seen a film, I notice! Anyway, if you like any of Anne Hathaway's work, you will like this - and if you don't, then try this one out - you may be pleasantly surprised. Anne Hathaway has perhaps fallen into the same trap as many other excellent actresses in that she is type-cast over and over in fairly 'blah' roles (eg in films such Ella Enchanted, Bride Wars or Devil Wears Prada), roles which do not allow her to display her acting talents to their fullest. Passengers fortunately, is a film that does let us see what Anne is capable of and hopefully she will do other films of a more serious nature in the future, as she can most certainly carry them.

As an aside, Sandra Bullock comes to mind as someone who was (is?) in a similar postion to Anne. I have always felt that she has remarkable acting talent and it is only in recent years that I have really seen it coming out in her films, Premonition being a fine example (and the Lakehouse - though to a much lesser degree).

addendum - having watched Passengers about 3 times now, I would most certainly bump it up to 5 stars and also recommend the extremely moving soundtrack. This film is of a much, much deeper nature than it may first appear and is one of those few films that I can say has 'touched' me inside. I feel this is due to a combination of the film's subject matter, the score and Anne Hathaway's very powerful performance.",1240531200,91,1807,4.423423423423423
3737236,2,B001P3SA9O,"""Passengers"" would have been a straight-to-DVD film had it not been for the name of Anna Hatherway (""Rachel Getting Married"") I am not saying that ""Passengers"" (of which story reminds me of Peter Weir's 1993 film ""Fearless"") is a horrible film. Actually its final chapter impressed me, but despite that and film's nice cinematography, the process to the resolution needs improvement.

Anna Hatherway is Claire Summers, a therapist who is assigned to counsel the five survivors of a major airline crash. Claire is intrigued by one survivor Eric (Patrick Wilson), whose personality it is obvious has drastically changed after the devastating event. While Claire is attracted to nice and handsome Eric, perhaps more than she should be, Eric experiences strange sensations.

""Passengers"" has an ambitious premise - which I am not allowed to reveal it all - but still I can say Rodrigo Garca as a director is trying to make a moving character-driven drama and intriguing thriller as the same time. Some of the survivors say there was an explosion before the crash, but the airline represented by David Morse's character strongly denies that. Claire smells a cover up, but she is not perfectly sure who is right.

One major problem is the character Anne Hatherway plays, a grief counselor whose behaviors are too immature and unprofessional. Rodrigo Garca, probably better known for his critically acclaimed film ""Nine Lives,"" did create more credible characters in the past, but here Hatherway's therapist is simply unbelievable, repeatedly committing mistakes that no professional therapist would do. ""Passengers"" is less a thriller than a drama, but to be a decent drama a film need a better protagonist you can relate to.

As to the film's thriller part, there is nothing intriguing about what the film shows or suggests. It gives us hints, certainly - a barking dog, a stranger standing in the street and so on - but these are thrown in at random, not strong enough to make us keep guessing.

Of course everything will be explained in the film's wrap-up - things about young Claire and her sister who is away from the town; about Dianne Wiest's character, always gentle and smiling; or about Andre Braugher's Perry, Claire's ""mentor."" As I said, the film's conclusion is powerful and emotional. Unfortunately it takes a long time to reach there.",1236556800,8,2344,5.046511627906977
3737237,2,B001P3SA9O,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Plane crashes
2. Anne Hathaway plays a grief counselor providing her services to the 5 survivors.
3. She doesn't seem to be having much luck
4. Against professional ethics, she gets involved with one of them
5. People start dropping out of counseling
6. It's probably because of her boring questions
7. The so called twist is obvious more than half an hour before the end, but still they prolong and drag it out like pulling fingernails.
8. If you've got a ticket to ride you'd be better off cashing it in.

You can probably sleep through the first half of the movie after reading (1.) and (2.) above.  Shortly after that, you'll see the twist.  Wait ten minutes to confirm it, then go back to sleep until the credits start rolling.

The entire cast sleepwalks their way through this dull drama, the punch line of which has been done before, and better.

3737238,3,B001P3SA9O,"At least the plot was a little different. (One gets very sick of seeing done to death love stories or revenge plots.)

The acting was not that great (this was obviously a lower budget film), and a lot of things that happened are things that I could never imagine happening in real life. (But then, I  guess that's why it's a movie.)

The point of the movie was letting people to accept death-- and putting other people into their path to help them know that they were dead.  One question comes up: Since a person will be dead for all eternity, is it really necessary for Providence to put people around them to help them know that they are dead? After all, they will have a VERY LONG time to get used to the idea.

This movie is about good enough to watch after it gets off the new release shelf. Not a dime more.",1232409600,7,813,4.219354838709678

Indeed, the entire supporting cast, with a surprise cameo from Dianne Wiest as the oddly wise neighbor, were all great.

The female lead ( a supposed professional) went waaaay beyond just tolerating his bizarre behavior in an effort to keep him talking ( she was supposed to be counciling him after surviving a plane crash, so just letting him talk I get) engaged well beyond the professional, letting him into her personal spCe, physically and mentally to the point you wonder who is the therapist? Sure, I get, movies try to build tension between the leads and the woman is supposed to be drawn to the male lead( cause heaven help us, a female professional is not going to be able to resist, amirite?)

3737333,4,B001P3SA9O,"Very predictable movie that you know ten minutes in how it's going to end because the way some earlier stuff in the story-line is told is just so obvious. So judging the rest of the film on how entertaining or compelling the filler story line taking you to the inevitable conclusion I'd say it's around three and a half stars. It is watchable but you've got a plot revolving around a professional psychologist (Anne Hathaway) with a patient who obviously simply wants to get into her pants (Patrick Wilson) and isn't interested in what she can offer him in relation to talking and dealing with the plane crash. The fact she doesn't just report this to her superiors and get him assigned to a male doctor or someone else is a bit unbelievable. She's also got a creepy neighbour who keeps wanting to become best friends, she's being hassled by some airline representative that seems to be monitoring her and her conversations with the surviving passengers shes' been assigned, and she's getting paranoid as those who remember things that aren't following the company's explanation aren't turning up to her meetings and seem to have completely disappeared.

When we actually see the plane crash play out there's situations on board where people would have died straight away and don't, just so we can have a more dramatic plane crash viewed from inside the cabin which just looked completely ridiculous. Passengers is watchable, but it's also predictable and nothing really memorable.  It might appeal more to fans of Hathaway or Wilson who don't mind what's filling the screen for the remainder of the 80 minutes or so after they've already worked out what's going on, as long as their eye candy is on that screen.",1451606400,,1712,4.839590443686006

3737340,2,B001P3SA9O,"I found Passengers to be well acted (I especially liked Dianne Wiest; it's been a while since I've seen her). It started out interesting, then turned into a rather bland, slow moving drama with some mystery added to it, then ended in a plot twist that MIGHT have worked (although I doubt it) if it had been better executed. It just didn't work for me.",1440374400,,351,4.415384615384616
3737341,5,B001P3SA9O,"Passengers was one of the movies that Hathaway used to distance herself from the Disney role and took on a much more adult theme.  She still was not as big a star when this movie came out as she is now (although she had done Devil Wears Prada, Brokeback Mountain and Get Smart by the time this was released so she was certainly on the rise) which I think helped the film overall.  It had a relatively small ensemble cast of mainly character actors and two leads (Hathaway and Patrick Wilson) who were not mega stars.  As a result I think the relationships between and roles of the characters felt authentic.

The story involves Hathway's character Claire acting as a grief counselor for the survivors of an airplane crash.  It starts with her trying to help them through the trauma, and then turns into a thriller where she is trying to uncover the truth about the events surrounding the crash and whether the airline was covering it up, and killing off the remaining survivors.  Along the way Hathaway and Wilson's characters end up in a relationship, crossing the ethical boundaries of her role as a therapist.  The story has quite a few twists and turns that you may or may not see coming.

For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds great.  For extras there are a couple making of features, and a few deleted scenes.  There is also a commentary track on the movie with the director and Patrick Wilson. Good for what is there, but not a ton of material.  While the movie was not a blockbuster and is not very well known, it is definitely worth checking out and makes for an enjoyable hour and a half.",1439942400,2,1618,4.469387755102041

Claire eventually succumbs to Eric (Patrick Wilson), but is troubled that her patients have stopped coming to group while suspecting the airline is attempting a cover-up. The ending I had figured out before I watched the film from reading the back of the DVD cover.

Hathaway always gives us a good performance no matter how bad the script. She was the saving grace of this otherwise predictable film.  Blu-Ray included deleted scenes as extras.

3737365,4,B001P3SA9O,"In a good many ways, this film was a disappointment. I was expecting a mystery with supernatural overtones. What I got was a disaster film becoming a conspiracy thriller then segueing into an ending which would've been more appropriate for the final episode of ""Lost."" Because of that, I was tempted to give it a 3 rating but the acting saved it, making it a 4. Even through the main character's angst upon discovering the truth, the film's leisurely pacing doesn't allow for as much tense build-up as could've been generated. The general atmosphere is more that of a romance than anything else.",1411776000,,595,4.786407766990291

3737368,2,B001P3SA9O,"Trying not to give anything away, the movie was about a plane crash and mystery surrounding how the crash happened and it's affect on the surviving passengers. This was a movie that could have or should have been more moving and spiritual but felt flat. One of the reasons the movie didn't engage me was that I didn't feel like there was any chemistry between the two lead actors (Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson) in the love story aspect of the movie.  Another reason was that the movie didn't feel very realistic - the subject matter was serious but the movie felt kind of light hearted and corny and also seemed like a low budget TV movie.  I actually purchased the movie because it featured some actors I really like (Andre Braugher, Dianne Wiest and Clea DuVall) and they didn't disappoint in smaller supporting roles but the movie as a whole did.",1410048000,,853,4.605263157894737
3737369,3,B001P3SA9O,"Watched it on Crackle via my PS4, it's ok... I figured out the plot about halfway or earlier but finished it to see just how it played out overall. It's basically a typical go gently into the afterlife type flick and what they think is an amazing plot twist at the end was really obvious to me, so it didn't come as a surprise. There is a subtle yet poignant gesture at the end which was nice, but once again it's not an amazing tear jerker and not at all scary for a ghost story.",1409616000,,480,4.063157894736842
3737384,4,B001P3SA9O,"I enjoyed this movie.  There were some slow scenes, but overall this was a very good mystery.
You can't beat the ending and there is just enough in the movie to keep you guessing about
what is really going on.",1388966400,,209,4.225
3737385,3,B001P3SA9O,"Passengers is at times heartwarming, suspenseful, and sad as it follows Claire (Anne Hathaway) around in her quest to discover the truth about a recent plane crash. A psychologist, Anne is tasked with helping the few survivors cope with their trauma. In the process, she becomes romantically involved with one of her patients (but he's quick to remind both Anne and the viewer that he's nobody's patient!), and she gradually begins to realize that nothing is as it seems.

Hathaway and Patrick Wilson deliver solid performances as the leads, and David Morse is convincing in his supporting role. Holly Hunter makes an appearance as Hathaway's endearing neighbor, but I thought she actually came off as being quite creepy, which was surely not the director's intent. Perhaps I was just on edge.

I'm a sucker for films like Passengers that allow the viewer to attempt to sort out what is going on before all is revealed. My issue with this film (and many others like it) is that the viewer is never given a fighting chance to figure out the twist. If I were to view a mind-bender like Passengers twice, I should be able to notice subtleties the second time around that allude to the conclusion of the film. There is nothing of the sort here. In fact, a lot of what I saw on-screen contradicted the end of the movie! In the interest of avoiding spoilers I won't go into detail, but I felt somewhat ripped-off when the credits began rolling by.

Even so, Passengers is an entertaining film that merits watching. I'm not as disappointed as I probably sound, and three stars might be a bit harsh, but I still warn potential viewers: prepare to get juked. Passengers does not let you figure anything out for yourself.",1387324800,,1711,4.7157190635451505

If you like anne hathaway, watch this!",1375488000,,364,4.447761194029851
3737390,4,B001P3SA9O,"This film was available on ""free"" TV, so I recorded it and watched it today.  It got a very low rating from both critics and viewers, so I wasn't expecting much.  But as someone that I know always says, ""Life comes down to expectations management.""  If you expect a lot and something doesn't deliver, it's disappointing.  For the converse, if you expect little and something's pretty good, it's a nice surprise.  ""Passengers"" certainly falls into that latter category for me and came off as a ""nice surprise.""

There are definitely some X-Files-like connections here.  This was filmed in Vancouver, just like the X-Files, at least until the last season or two.  Note ""The Smoking Man"" in this film; he was the mean guy in the X-Files.  And the female lead -- Anne Hathaway -- plays a doctor, while the female lead in the X-Files -- Gillian Anderson -- played a doctor as well.  Well, Ms. Anderson played a surgeon or medical doctor, while Ms. Hathaway plays a psychiatrist.  You could say that the former profession heals people while the latter hurts them, but I digress.  (As an aside, I actually thought about Cory Monteith a bit here while watching, since he just recently died in a Vancouver hotel.)

And like the X-Files, you really don't know what's going on through at least the first couple of acts, or at least you shouldn't, unless you're psychic, similar to Ms. Hathaway's hypothesis of the male lead, Patrick Wilson.  He doesn't seem to know her but he seems to surprisingly know some personal things about her anyways, and even though she's a ""scientist,"" you can't blame her for believing that he might have ESP.

Now, films like this are very difficult to review without giving away a giveaway.  So, if you haven't seen this film, skip to the next paragraph.  MINOR SPOILER ALERT:  there are some issues with this screenplay, or at least the director's interpretation of it.  There are some inconsistencies.  For example, Ms. Wilson seems confused about a dog at one point but then right afterwards explains the meaning of the dog to Ms. Hathaway.  Was he lying to withhold the truth from her, or was this a screenplay miss?  Also, notice on the plane how Mr. Wilson seems to move one seat over but doesn't seem to put on a safety belt.  Then there is an explosion.  I believe that he would have been sucked out of the plane at this point.  While this film is like the X-Files, it also has some similar patterns as ""The Sixth Sense"" (TSS), but TSS did a better job of unwinding at the end with keeping consistency throughout.  END MINOR SPOILER ALERT.

But still, a minor tearjerker whose theme might be something that Mr. Wilson said about halfway:  ""Live for today because tomorrow may not come.""  Indeed.  And this film does a good job of creating sympathetic characters.  So, I'll give a recommendation for a film that, while it certainly had its issues, it also had some pretty strong points.",1375142400,,2913,4.686390532544379

3737400,5,B001P3SA9O,"Regrettably, my first viewing of this movie was with commercials.  After copying it to my DVR and fast forwarding to start each scene that proved to be a terrible distraction.  Also, I had a hard time relating to the lead character's role played by Anne Hathaway.  I felt the ""assignment"" given her was too difficult a situation for someone so young, 2 masters and numerous PhD's put aside.  This was a big reason I couldn't get into the movie at first.  But, as the story went on, I believed the conspiracy theory.  What really tugged at my ""heart-strings"" was the dog appearing and reappearing in scenes.
So, when the time came that Patrick Wilson's character said ""That's my dog!"", I was truly blown away and understood what was happening to the passengers.  However, I was not expecting Anne Hathaway's character looking through the flight manifest, seeing her name, and her flashbacks that followed.  Wow!  Anne Hathaway's scene at her sister's front door was a tear jerker (great acting by the way).  You felt her emotion as she realizes she didn't make it.  Double wow!  The story line explaining people and animals comeback to help you adjust was the icing-on-the-cake.  How nice it would be if that were true, to see your pet companions, friends and/or family help you through the transition.

3737406,2,B001P3SA9O,"The previews for this movie looked awesome. They seemed to indicate that something weird happened to the survivors of a plane crash. Like, for example, they randomly ""knew things"" about the psychiatrist giving them group therapy. Well, the psychiatrist played by Anne Hathaway kept going on and on about how could the one patient possibly know she had a sister? Come on. Almost everyone has a sister. That's the type of guess a ""psychic"" would make.

Next, the patients started to disappear. I didn't really notice because most of them had not appeared in the movie for more than 2 minutes anyway. Most of the movie was focused not on the thriller aspect and the group  therapy but on Anne's relationship with one patient in particular. And inappropriate relationships between psychiatrists and patients have been totally overdone in movies. Anne Hathaway really wasn't believable as a psychiatrist, either. Granted, that may have been the fault of the role itself. She was a very young and immature character.

The ending was a little surprising. I didn't see it coming for most of the movie, although I saw it a bit before the characters did. The only problem was it left too many unanswered questions.",1339027200,,1204,4.921182266009852

3737416,2,B001P3SA9O,"Based on PASSENGER's marketing, I was hoping for a scary supernatural tale.  Instead, this was a case of too little ""horror,"" too late.

Indeed, not so much horror as squishy, New Age mush.

If you like spiritual pseudo-horror like THE FORGOTTEN or DRAGONFLY, you might enjoy PASSENGERS, since it's the same old, same old (with borrowings from THE SIXTH SENSE, THE OTHERS, GHOST, JACOB'S LADDER, and the original TWILIGHT ZONE TV series).

This is not really a spoiler, since the marketing (e.g. DVD box blurbs) kinda give away the premise...

Passengers survive a plane crash, but then begin vanishing. Like that TWILIGHT ZONE episode about astronauts who survive a mishap in space, but when they return to Earth, they begin vanishing...  Something they had encountered ""up there"" didn't mean for them to return, and is correcting its mistake.

PASSENGERS had scary potential.  Why are surviving passengers vanishing? What's being ""corrected""?  A rip in space/time?  Some Supernatural Order (e.g., FINAL DESTINATION)?

No, instead PASSENGERS borrows the more familiar explanation, found in THE SIXTH SENSE, JACOB'S LADDER, GHOST, and THE OTHERS.  If you know those ""twist"" endings, you'll guess early on what PASSENGERS is about.

PASSENGERS is slow and boring.  We're nearly TWO THIRDS into the film before it gets ominous.  A horror film should be ominous 10 to 15 minutes in, then get scarier. Instead, PASSENGERS's ""horror"" starts late and remains tepid.

In its final 10 minutes, the film shifts from weak horror to ""feel good"" New Age spirituality.

The passengers assigned to her seem reluctant and guarded in what they say. Much to her surprise she starts hearing very different stories about what actually happened just before and during the crash. Her life is further complicated by a handsome passenger named Eric, played by Patrick Wilson who doesn't seem to want to play by her rules.

Her counseling efforts are further complicated by the disappearance of some of the passengers without explanation. Claire immediately suspects the airline of foul play and tries to confront the airline representative who is totally unhelpful. Feeling helpless and frustrated by events, Claire turns to Eric and events are further complicated for her.

The second thing you need to know- everything taking place for the first 80% of film leads to an ending that's intended to shock the viewers.  It fails though, because for one thing it's poorly and predictably executed, and second of all, the weak writing you experience throughout the movie makes the conclusion incredibly underwhelming.

A missed opportunity for a thriller pretty much sums up Passengers.  Movie writers need to understand that in order for a thriller to work, you can't revolve ALL the events around one unexpected twist at the end (which, in my opinion at least, wasn't that unexpected anyway).  You need to tell a solid story the entire time leading up to a satisfying conclusion.

I was sitting in my college dorm, browsing Netflix, looking for a good movie to stream. I'd never heard of ""Passengers,"" and was pretty hesitant to watch it. I was expecting your typical ""airplane crash"" mystery flic and for a while it seemed to be moving in that direction. Soon enough however, I found myself in a lost state, unsure of what was happening--the pieces were there but something just wasn't ""right.""

The surprise ending literally left me is a special kind of shock that I can most definitely appreciate.

Typically I'd get into detail about camera angles and soundtrack score--elements which were all greatly constructed and implemented in this film--but I am in genuine and sincere awe of the storyline and overall concept of the film. After reading the previous reviews, I guess it may not be for the typical moviegoer but if you give it a chance you'll certainly develop a GREAT appreciation for it.

Mr. Perry (Andre Braugher) thinks that it is time for a therapist Claire summers (Anne Hathaway) to do something practical so she is assigned to help the passengers of the recent plane crash.  The passenger's accounts of the plane crash vary greatly and soon the passengers seem to be disappearing or at least not coming to the sessions. It appears that the airline is covering something up and everybody is in on it. Is Claire paranoid to the point where she cannot function properly?

With the creepy mystique and the slow pace and mysterious people, our minds are racing ahead. We remember all of the conspiracy movies spooky movies and just downright movies of all kinds in the twists. Okay which one is this one going to be? Now who is paranoid?

It is best to let the movie unfold into with the flow and you may find that you enjoy it and with all movies that have a mystery about them you will want to re-watch this to see what you missed.

One suspicious character is Airline representative Arkin played by David Morse. See him again in ""Contact"" (1997).

I only saw the Blu-ray so I cannot compare to other versions but be sure to also listen to the voice over commentary by Rodrigo Garcia - Director and Patrick Wilson who plays Eric.

3737431,4,B001P3SA9O,"Passengers may not be the most memorable or original film I've ever seen; but it's actually rather well done and I liked the convincing acting of both Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson in their roles as the main characters. The cinematography and the choreography work wonders for the film; and the casting was very well done. The action flows along at a good pace although the script and the footage could have been edited down a few minutes to make the action tighter and the film a better one.

When the film starts, we meet a young psychologist named Claire (Anne Hathaway) who takes on the responsibility for running group therapy for the handful of survivors of a horrific plane crash. Her boss, Perry (Andre Braugher) believes it would be a good assignment for Claire to get her ""out of (her) comfort zone."" Claire must help them talk about their grief and pain to get over their post traumatic stress and ""find out the truth.""

Once the group starts, Claire meets the survivors and the group includes Norman (Don Thompson), Shannon (Clea DuVall) and Dean (Ryan Robbins). However, members of the group start to miss therapy sessions; and Claire slowly begins to believe that they are missing persons and not merely dropping out of therapy. Claire and other people in the group are also uncomfortable when they notice a stranger staring in from the outside at the group; and Claire's relationship with the airline representative Arkin (David Morse) is not exactly going well as he is clearly holding things back from her, possibly to avoid the airline being held liable for the accident.

In addition, one more survivor, Eric (Patrick Wilson), gives Claire a surprise when he comes off as rather happy and upbeat about life despite the terrible crash he just experienced. As the rest of the action occurs, Claire gradually finds herself falling for Eric and this muddles things for her both professionally and personally. She also has a well-meaning but rather nosy neighbor, Toni (Dianne Wiest).

Of course the plot can go in several different directions but suffice to say I never anticipated the way the film ended. Talk about a surprise! It's one of the best things about the film.

The DVD comes with a few deleted scenes and there's an optional running commentary with director Rodrigo Garcia and Patrick Wilson. We also get the featurettes entitled ""Analysis of the Plane Crash"" and ""The Manifest & Making of Passengers.""

I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy thriller dramas with mystery and even some romance will enjoy this film.",1267920000,18,2580,4.8522727272727275
3737432,3,B001P3SA9O,"On the surface PASSENGERS is the story about airplane crash following which the airline hires a psychologist Dr Claire Summers (Anne Hathaway) to hold group therapy sessions for those PTSD survivors.  The group is strange, not so much for the crash but more for the lives they've lived leading up to the crash - or so Claire believes.  Claire is particularly drawn to Eric (Patrick Wilson) who seems somehow above the emotional trauma and indeed begins to 'court' Claire with requests for house calls, incidents that lead to a romance.  Gradually the survivors in Claire's therapy group disappear and Claire is made suspicious of the cause of the accident, a fact that disturbs the airline person Arkin (David Morse).  Eric's strange behavior as well as the appearance of the odd character Toni (Dianne Wiest) and the counsel from Claire's colleague Perry (Andre Braugher) begin to unravel a mystery that is finally made clear in the closing moments of the film.  To say more would be to spoil the ending.

PASSENGERS is not a great movie but it is a fairly good and well-acted suspense/romance drama.  The cast is solid but the direction by Rodrigo Garca of the Swiss cheese script by Ronnie Christensen is shaky: the premise is good but the getting there is full of potholes and road kill.  Nevertheless it is a good little diversion of a film for a rainy night.  And the actors do their very best to make it better than it is.

At first it's a little frustrating as Anne Hathaway struggles with her therapist assignment - five men and women who've survived a crash-landed jet on American soil. They may or may not have acquired powers because of the crash - and people and odd things appear around them? Or perhaps the airline is being less than truthful about its planes and their maintenance records when she confronts them (David Morse)? Why is Patrick Wilson (one of the bloodied survivors who has recovered remarkably quickly) so determined to woe and date Anne? And why do others around Anne now want all manner of things from her - her boss wants a speedy report put in (Andre Braugher) - the suddenly way too friendly neighbor (Dianne Wiest)?

But then comes the ""shocking"" end, which really isn't all that shocking, and you are thrown into a Sixth Sense clone. With Sixth Sense all the pieces in the movie added up. But with this one it does not. Questions are left unanswered. For example:

1. Why were these few ""survivors"" chosen to wander around? Were they the only ones that realized they had not survived the crash? That almost makes sense, except for one of the supporting characters who made peace with herself during the crash and was willing to accept death. Except she must not have accepted death, because she was one of the people that had to find that special somebody to be able to move on.
2. Hathaway's character couldn't recognize her own aunt and teacher, both of which were special to her at some point when they were alive. Huh? If they were so special, shouldn't she have recognized them, or at the very least be haunted by their presence? Everybody else who saw that special somebody at least reacted the right way. Maybe they were scared and ran away at first, but at least they reacted and seemed to recognize them. Hathaway's character goes through the whole movie without ever knowing until the end.
3. What really was the cause of the crash? The pilot reveals himself and says it was his error, when everybody else claims otherwise. When Hathaway's character begins to realize she was on the flight, we the audience see the fate of the plane's flight, which seems to prove that what everbody else was saying was true. The plane exploded as a result of maintenance issues. So does this mean the pilot is blaming himself for something he could not control? Is the airline somehow responsible? Will the truth ever be made public? Was there a point to this subplot, or was it just thrown in there without any real purpose?
4. What about the pilot and the amnesia? The amnesia seemed to recognize the pilot, but then we don't find out if that is how he came to terms with his death, or did he just remember the pilot for some distant memory? The pilot blames himself and wanders off. Does that mean he did indeed cause the crash? What became of his character?
5. And finally, why does Hathaway's character wake up in home while the others are wandering around the crash site? Why can't she understand she was on that flight?",1254096000,3,3038,4.564102564102564

3737454,4,B001P3SA9O,"This is a movie that I admit I found boring the first time I watched it. I got distracted easily and thought a lot of the characters were creeps. But when you find out the amazing twist and experience the phenominal ending that is both powerful and extremely moving, you will most likely be tempted to start from the beginning and watch it all over again. I did, and I was careful to pay attention to every single second of it, and it's quite frankly ten times better the 2nd time round! There's so much going on in this movie that it's hard to believe all the negative reviews - perhaps they too were snoozing through the first half and forgot to wake up for the second half, and lied and said they saw it all and thought it was garbage? Less likely things have happened.
Basically the twist in this movie is so outrageous that it changes literally everything you see throughout.
Maybe you have to be a fan of these supernatural, caring films. Maybe they shouldn't have advertised it as a thriller because in the end it's anything but.
This is a touching film that I recommend more for women than men. For anybody who has lost a loved one, this movie is for you. And oddly enough, this has made me less nervous about flying on a plane next week.

Ignore the reviewers - you come across them all the time and know they are pretentious! They get paid to do what I am doing right now for free, only difference is their prejudices and expectancies overshadow their enjoyment of what is essentially in this case, a really well written supernatural mystery, with many, many layers.

Enjoy the ride, so to speak.",1250812800,,1606,4.440677966101695
3737455,5,B001P3SA9O,"I saw this movie this week.  This was a movie I just thought was going to suck.  I am not a big fan of Ann Hathaway and the guy that plays opposite her had played a diddler in Hard Candy and every time I see him in movies that's what I think of, perfect case of being type casted I guess.  The movie ended up being great, I don't really want to say much about it because it would ruin it for others.  It is a pretty simple movie to follow that is very easy to watch and it gives you that rewarding feeling at the end if that makes any sense.  I ended up watching it again with my wife the next night.  I would recommend buying this DVD.",1250121600,,636,3.853846153846154
3737456,4,B001P3SA9O,"I heard about this movie on a radio review. He gave it one star out of five because he couldn't follow the plot. I had no problem following, although my guesses at what was happening evolved throughout the movie. The fact that you could surmise the ending doesn't negate the fact that it is a moving and touching exploration of ""what if..."" and ""maybe when...""

Although it gets a bit slow in the middle (I admit to a bit of fast-forwarding) the story is well crafted and very well acted.... as the story is put together you can't help but wish the ""what if..."" is true.",1249344000,,570,4.377358490566038
3737457,5,B001P3SA9O,"yes, the twist is something we have seen many times before but its handled very differently here. its not meant to shock or be scary, instead its tender and moving. anne hathaway is great as always in this beautiful mystery.",1248998400,,224,4.625
3737458,3,B001P3SA9O,"Essentially, lasting impressions of this film will depend on the fulcrum of opinion regarding the acting ability of Anne Hathaway.  While she is supported by a bevy of veteran actors I consider talented (Dianne Wiest, Andre Braugher, David Morse) as well as a couple where I believe the jury is still out (Patrick Wilson and Clea DuVall) with the exception of Wilson, their contributions are mainly tangential and for the majority of the film, sketchily delineated. Hathaway is called upon to hold the viewers interest and unfortunately, I didn't feel she was up to the challenge. As a therapist somewhat reluctantly assigned to work as a grief counselor with a group of airline crash survivors, I found her unconvincing for a variety of reasons and notwithstanding the attempts to insert twists and turns in plot progression, the big dog's portion of the movie is wholly dependent  on her.

One inherent constraint was the director's decision to obscure his vision  in several interwoven approaches. Parts are intended to be pure suspense, other segments have aspects of the mystery thriller; he reverts to what appears to be linear dramatic character study development and regrettably also is not averse to throwing a bit of superfluous romantic influence. In the end, the conflicting courses do not mesh successfully and for most of the movie it feels like the only reason to continue viewing is the illogical personal commitment to see it through to conclusion.

Only in the last half-hour or so are all of the clues that one may have noticed early on amalgamated to bring the actual plot of the movie into focus.  Director Rodrigo Garcia makes a yeoman's effort to bind all of the anomalies, curiosities and sub-plots into a cohesive finish but he takes too long and meanders too far downstream in getting there for a film that ultimately many viewers may find derivative or suggestive of a few other, more widely successful films.

One key aspect in that eventually comes across particularly flat is what turns out to selective memory loss for a few of the characters because it seems completely out of synch with other attributes they exhibit.  I wish I could give a more concise explanation but any more depth would be way too close to a spoiler in my opinion.

In the final analysis (no pun intended) this is a decent effort but only remarkable for comparative purposes to other works.",1248393600,2,2394,4.905940594059406
3737459,3,B001P3SA9O,"My wife did not understand the ending, and to be honest neither did I. But we did like the rest of the movie.",1246665600,,109,3.782608695652174
3737460,2,B001P3SA9O,"Many continuity mistakes, which betray a low budget film. Acting is decent. Anne Hathaway is cute, period, and Patrick Wilson could use a better haircut. Conclusion: Lightweight. Watchable if you don't have anything else.

*SPOILER ALERT* The premise is not new: people are dead but they don't know it (Sixth Sense et.al). While carefully choppy editing might prevent film viewers from realizing it, the dead themselves supposedly are 24/7 interacting with live people. How could ghosts not notice after a while that living people are ignoring them altogether?

Even within the convention of accepting the existence of ghosts, incoherences pile up:
  David Morse's character makes no sense: As he initially looks, is he a creepy part of the airline's conspiracy to coverup an explosion? Wait a minute! No. He is the -now dead- pilot of the plane. How come he did not realize that? How does he relate to other workers at the airport? The airline conspiracy doesn't go anywhere, anyway.
  Why only a few of the passengers kept walking around? (The other 100 or so seem to be dead for good).
  Apparently, loved ones come back to take dead people to heaven. Anne Hathaway's character, however, until the last moment does not recognize her auntie and confuses a teacher from her infancy with a senior psychologist. (By the way, the psychologist she portrays is most unprofessional, naive, incompetent).
  Why the other six passengers remember being on the plane but Hathaway,  until the end, does not? Why one of them does not remember who he was while the others do? Uhmm.
  Dead people interact normally with solid objects (telephones, cars, motorcycle, doors, briefcase, sailboat) but a train goes through Patrick Wilson as if he were gaseous.
  How being dead could explain that Hathaway's sister (who is very much alive) is never in her house? What is the relevancy of that?
  And so on.",1246492800,4,1888,4.980830670926518
3737461,4,B001P3SA9O,"In the shadow of Six Sense, Passengers produces a strange tale that will have you saying....What is going on?...and then brings it to conclusion.
Anne Hathaway is a wonderful actress, very talented, and easy on the eyes. I have heard missed reviews on this movie, but decide to check it out myself. I felt it was entertaining and worth my time. If you expecting big thrills or a horror story....don't bother. This movie is more the drama/mystery.",1245888000,,446,4.805194805194805
3737462,2,B001P3SA9O,"Amazon's critic described this film as ""derivative.""  That's an understatement!  It's pretty much a ripoff of THE SIXTH SENSE and FEARLESS.  I won't bother to summarize the plot since so many others have done so, but suffice it to say that any one with half a brain can pretty quickly figure out where this story is going.  I did so before inserting the disc into my DVD player!

The saddest thing about this movie is that it had enormous potential.  In the hands of a different writer it could have taken its premise to much more original territory than the totally predictable course it follows  (with often ridiculous dialogue and poorly drawn characters).  And both the director and producer should have been tarred and feathered for not spotting the terrible script long before one minute of footage was shot!

The one good thing I can say about this mess it that the ending is fairly interesting.  The only problem is that you have to sit through the first 3/4ths of the film in order to get there.",1245715200,,1004,4.621468926553672
3737463,1,B001P3SA9O,"(1.) Anne is attractive and the film is so dependent on it that she and the camera exploit it with constant close ups of her face and her charming/beguiling but theatrically pointless expressions (over 50% of the film actually).
(2.) Plot is a rip off of other crash movies where we are led to believe they're alive but they're not.
(3.) Dialogue is very poorly scripted with cliched non-professional exchanges between roles such as Wilson as the ex-corporate V.P. turns wall painter, motorcycle rider, sailboat sailor, midnight swimmer, rooftop wall sitter (fortunately less than a minute for each activity) with the totally unrealistic and incompetent questioning by Anne the psychiatrist.
(4.) Little effort by the studio to spend money. No realistic special effects and no effort to research plane crashes. The plane's remnants should have been clearly marked and placed in a secure hanger. To save composer and musicians fees the music was a constant and monotonous plunking of a few piano keys. Saved money by not having a director as evidenced by the lack of continuity and building tension appropriate for this type of movie. Well, someone added a gratuitously brief semi-sex scene.
(5.) But the worst crime that the studio commits is to exploit people's fear of flying and death with the feelgood ""you're not really dead just vacationing your dreams forever"".",1245542400,3,1368,5.111607142857143
3737464,5,B001P3SA9O,"""Passengers"" was a very pleasant surprise!

I got the movie for my wife, a big Anne Hathaway (Bride Wars, Havoc, The Devil Wears Prada) fan, but also because the movie stars Patrick Wilson (Watchmen, Hard Candy).

Through the first thirty minutes of the movie, I thought it was going in a good direction, then they threw in some plot twists and I started to lose a little interest. The last twenty minutes of the movie are excellent, the story twists to the point that you will never see it coming.

The movie also stars David Morse and Clea Duvall.

Overall a really good mystery / thriller, take a chance on it, I think you will be surprised!

Directed to perfection by Rodrigo Garcia, it had an unfortunately limited Halloween-week release and quickly disappeared from theaters. Though slightly derivative of films like ""Fearless"" (1993), ""Flatliners,"" ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Ghost,"" it is nevertheless a fascinating blend of great writing, great acting and other great production values. Therapist Hathaway is ordered by boss Andre Braugher to treat survivors of a plane crash. Survivor Wilson hides his true feelings of fear and anger by making major changes in his life, such as painting...but soon he receives visits from the dog he had as a boy--which is buried in his parents' back yard. Soon, the other survivors begin to disappear, leading Hathaway to believe that the airline is killing them to destroy evidence of a mechanical problem that has plagued the company. Hatahway can't get ahold of her estranged sister and visits her house...just as an airline rep David Morse appears there too. He  reveals that all of the plane's passengers died in the crash and she discovers that she, too, died on the flight.
