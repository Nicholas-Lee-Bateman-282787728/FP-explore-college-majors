2634101,4,B000HCMV6W,"Light fare and the policeman always gets his man sums up this DVD edition of the 1950s TV drama ""Sgt Preston of Yukon"".
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are in the Canadian north keeping the peace against great odds at times but always succeed to ensure that justice is meted out and that the bad guys go to jail. Good light viewing and a piece of TV nostalgia.",1354406400,,362,4.338235294117647
2634102,5,B000HCMV6W,"The production was excellent of season 2 of this wonderful series. As I look forward to season 3 (the last) I can't help but wonder, more than 50 years later, why they didn't continue it. The writing is pretty good (with an occasional exception), and the acting and sets were top notch, considering that they did so many episodes per year and didn't have much time to work on each one. Simmons, King, and Rex are all quite beautiful specimens of their type!",1341014400,4,457,4.518072289156627
2634103,5,B000HCMV6W,"Much like season one of Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Season Two had excellent production values.  The audio and video restoration was super on this season of the series.  Again, all the right values were being displayed during the airing of this season.  Again, great writers and producers.  Fran Striker stories seemed to be a notch higher than the other writers.",1215820800,13,366,4.950819672131147
2634104,4,B000HCMV6W,"The 78 half-hour episodes of the ""kiddie"" television adventure series ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" were originally broadcast on CBS during the 1955 to 1958 broadcast seasons; and in syndication for many years after.  The Season Two DVD set features the 23 episodes from the middle season.  The episode titles and their original air dates are listed below.  Resolution is a bit grainy and overexposed so don't expect a great image-but it is viewable and given the reception quality in many households during the original broadcasts the image will feel like authentic 1950's television viewing. No special features on the DVD's-just the episodes.

This was one of many transplants to early television from network radio.  It was created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker who also put together both the radio and television versions of ""The Lone Ranger"" and the radio version of ""The Green Hornet"".

At a time of look-alike westerns filmed on the back-lots of Hollywood, ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" offered viewers the white landscape of Canada's Yukon Territory.  It was actually filmed each winter in the mountains of Big Bear Lake, in southern California.

Like ""The Lone Ranger"", each week the story's setting and characters were described by the narrator in the opening credits:  ""Sergeant Preston of the Northwest Mounted Police with Yukon King, swiftest and strongest lead dog breaking the trail in the relentless pursuit of lawbreakers, in the wild days of the Yukon. Back to the days of the Gold Rush, as Sergeant Preston, with his wonder dog, Yukon King, meets the challenge of the Yukon"".

The gold rush he is talking about occurred in the 1890's as Canada's desolate western frontier found itself suddenly occupied by a swarm of gold crazed miners, cutthroats, and tenderfeet.  It was up to Sgt. Preston (his first name is never used) to track down thieves, murderers, and claim jumpers.  The job left him no time for romance even though his Boston Blackie mustache, red uniform, puffed-out trousers, and DI hat must  have driven the ladies crazy.

No doubt the education of baby boomers on NWMP lore was responsible for the successful introduction of ""Dudley Do-right"" to ""Rocky and and His Friends/The Bullwinkle Show"" (1959-1964).

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

2634105,4,B000HCMV6W,"1950s TV series about a Mountie and his beloved dog, set in the late 1890s Yukon Gold Rush. Think wild woolly western travelling lawman with plenty of snow (the cold and wet kind) and no female companionship whatsoever. Richard Simmons stars as the requisite handsome mustachioed Mountie, derivative of the 1930-1950 Challenge of the Yukon Radio series. Small parts were actually filmed outdoors. There are dogsleds, steamships, telegraphs, Eskimoes, Indians, plus French and English speaking Canadians. Not quite the usual Classic Western, but produced by the same people who did The Lone Ranger. 2nd round of fun stuff.",1178928000,12,621,5.346938775510204

8138419,5,B000HCMV6W,"Just received this set and have watched one of the episodes. I have been catching these shows on a local TV channel on Saturday mornings under a different title and DVRd them, then decided to buy the entire series so I would always have them, especially for my grandchildren. This was a dear favorite of mine in the 1950s, and I remember drooling over Richard Simmons then, and as an adult I see my taste hasn't changed. He sure is a sight to behold in his uniform and his mannerisms and style are absolutely smashing. He seems so natural as a Mountie. When originally watching these shows I recall there weren't many with his horse, but lately I've only seen the summer shows and am looking forward to the winter ones. After all, living in Maine we had a lot in common with the Yukon. One thing I noticed on the back of the package they mentioned the Mounties ""doing work in Alaska."" Now surely whoever wrote that should know that Alaska wasn't part of Canada even in the 1890s. Stuff like that drives me nuts. It is truly a wonderful series with great moral messages. Also it amazes me that we have the technology to relive these old series again. It will mean a lot to us 'war babies' and 'baby boomers' as we age even more. I would highly recommend it to anyone tired of the drivel coming out of Hollywood today.",1380844800,5,1316,4.397540983606557
8138420,5,B000HCMV6W,"These are great shows that bring back a lot of fond memories.  The shows promote good values, provide action, outdoor adventure, a bit of history and they are all in color.  My children are now enjoying the show.  It is much better than much of the 'educational' programming available to children now.  Truly, a timeless classic.  It is appropriate for most children, without being dumbed-down.  Adults will enjoy it, as well.",1377820800,,426,4.929577464788732
8138421,5,B000HCMV6W,I use to listen to Sergeant Preston when I was a little boy.  Later I watched it on television.  Oh for those carefree days of yesterday.  It is refreshing to watch a show where the good guy wins.,1374537600,,196,4.105263157894737
8138422,4,B000HCMV6W,I enjoy Sergeant Preston of the Yukon immensely. It is extremely corny and every remote cabin looks suspiciously like the same cabin but it is fun. As a dog lover I watch it mostly to see Yukon King in action.,1362096000,2,209,4.25
8138423,4,B000HCMV6W,"This series was broadcast in the mid 1950's. Anyone expecting a grainy black and white show is in for a shock. This looks like it was filmed in technicolor. And it could pass for a pristine film print. What a delight to watch. Preston's red uniform against the outdoor scenery looks great. It's a wholesome family show: we have our manly hero bound to the code of the mounties, and King the ""wonder dog."" They don't make shows like this anymore: we've become too cynical and self-absorbed to want (and produce) heroes like this. A pity.",1359504000,4,536,4.59375
