3785655,5,B001SGEUBK,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD to the very end. Thats partly because I enjoy ancient history and partly because I love the UK countryside, but the approach they used to introduce us to each site makes you REALLY feel like you are there. The extra features are great too, especially when you appreciate all the work and dedication it took to make this DVD. I'm now dreaming of travelling the very same route that they took to see each site in person, and what better way to retrace thier steps that to take this DVD with me!",1294704000,4,522,4.391752577319588
3785656,3,B001SGEUBK,"Some great photography and good information. Presented sometimes cursorily and others pedantically. Good pictures, but the presentation lacks polish and is often opinionated.",1256601600,3,174,6.608695652173913
3785657,3,B001SGEUBK,"""Standing With Stones"" is a two-hour video tour of over one hundred (!) megalithic sites in Great Britain. It's great to visit so many spots at once, but the downside is that very little time can be spent at any given place. Even Stonehenge is given only a very short scene in the video. The film's writer (and on-camera host) is an enthusiast, not an expert; there isn't much interpretation and analysis, nor even many facts, to be had on this video. (It is useful, though, to be reminded how little we really know about these ancient places). The photography is quite well done, and adds measurably to one's enjoyment of the DVD.

To summarize, this is a pleasant video that will appeal to people who would like a brief tour of (lots of) British megalithic sites. However, viewers who want more details about these places are likely to come away disappointed.",1255132800,17,861,4.6644736842105265
3785658,5,B001SGEUBK,"This DVD is perfect for beginning a journey through megalithic sites.  The narrator is very energetic and funny, yet shows a depth of interest and dedication to the subject that most programs lack.  He admits what we do not know (instead of postulating along old well travelled ""Offficial"" theory lines)....very refreshing.  Also a keen observer: he notices an amazing fact about one stone that has escaped the notice of professional archeologists for decades......check it out.  I have been to Stonehenge and Avebury, West Kennet and viewed Silbury Hill.  Watching this, I was given deeper insight into these, as well as a sense of the sheer magnitude of sites that exist today.  When you add  the sites that did not survive,  the scale of this building process boggles the mind!  A huge undertaking by a native people.",1248998400,20,820,4.970588235294118
3785659,3,B001SGEUBK,"Somewhat interesting, but you REALLY have to be into this subject matter to find it interesting...he basically drives from site to site discussing what may or may not have happened there...after about an hour and ten minutes, I yawned and shut it off. Perhaps I lack the right anthropology/archeology gene, but ultimately I found this DVD boring.",1246492800,2,346,5.087719298245614
3785660,5,B001SGEUBK,"This is a beautifully done tour through the British Isles of the ancient stone monuments of the megalithic people (Neolithic). If you are looking for Stonehenge , this isn't it, but it's thought - provoking, sometimes funny, and Rupert Soskin is a rather engaging host through the film. He goes to Britain, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, as well as Skara Brae, giving a sampler of the various types of megalithic sites in the British Isles. Some of them are obscure, but they make you wonder what in the world our ancestors were thinking so long ago?  It's entertaining too, which isn't easy to do while looking at old piles of rocks. Very nicely photographed.  Easily five stars here.",1415145600,2,683,4.779661016949152
3785661,5,B001SGEUBK,"Elegant cinematography, an engaging narrator and up-to-the minute archeology make this film outstanding.",1413849600,,104,7.076923076923077
3785662,5,B001SGEUBK,Beautiful DVD with great stories.,1407110400,,33,5.8

3785664,5,B001SGEUBK,Well done.  Beautiful scenery included in the CD.  Very informative.  I gained lots of knowledge and so interesting.  A must see.,1402099200,,129,5.0
3785665,5,B001SGEUBK,This was a fascinating journey around Britain with many sites that I was not familiar with despite a life-long interest in prehistory. Well worth watching.,1399248000,,155,5.24
3785666,3,B001SGEUBK,"This film is great eye candy, but unfortunately you are not left with much to ponder at the end except their ascetic beauty. Site after site is visited with rarely any theory or hypothests thrown out to us to keep us intellectuallt stimulated. It's a great watch, but you won't learn much.",1397260800,,289,4.576923076923077
3785667,5,B001SGEUBK,"I have a general interest in archaeology and the Standing With Stones is  a good overview of the megalithic stone archaeological
sites  in Britain.  The  film quality was excellent. Rupert Soskin presented a very good general explanation of  the sites.  I  saw megalithic  sites that  I will probably never visit.  Any further study
of  the  sites I  can obtain through  books or  internet.  I  have added the Standing With  Stones DVD to  my  DVD archaeological
collections.  Charles",1394668800,,484,5.025974025974026
3785668,5,B001SGEUBK,"Being from the U.S; I have been always intrigued by the Megalithic stone sites in the British Isles and Ireland, I picked up this video to try to get a better understanding of what they were all about.  This video is basically a travelogue of Megalithic sites that the production team visited, with seemingly expert commentary and a history about each site.  The production values are very high and an effort was taken to visually present each site at its best, regarding natural lighting and viewing angles.  Although this is a private production, it could easily have been a very high class PBS presentation. A large number of sites were visited/recorded, most of the well known ones are here; but, also it includes a great number of sites that seemed to be well off the beaten track.
The only negative thing I can say is that I was hoping to understand how and why the peoples of that era spent the time and energy, as they must have done, and just how they made use of them in their culture.  That is not the film's fault.  I've have never read/heard that science has made that determination yet  ... much of these Megalithic sites remain, and maybe always will, an enigma.",1389312000,,1177,4.580952380952381
3785669,5,B001SGEUBK,"I had purchased this DVD for myself over a year ago; it is absolutely fascinating, and if Mr. Soskin headed up a tour following the same path around England, I would definitely sign up!  It is fun to watch, and I have loaned it to many friends, some of whom bought their own copies.  I liked it so well that I bought two more  - one for my son and one for my son-in-law.",1386374400,,370,3.972972972972973
3785670,5,B001SGEUBK,This exploration of ancient stones in the UK is beautifully filmed.  The narration is compelling.  I'm planning my trip now!,1369699200,,124,5.15
3785671,2,B001SGEUBK,"The narration is done by a knowledgeable guide who revels in providing some of his own interpretations, educated guesses. To his credit he doesn't he states this at the very beginning of the documentary. Other than the stunning scenery, There's not much about this video that I enjoyed.",1364169600,,286,4.979166666666667
3785672,5,B001SGEUBK,"After watching this video, you can't help but want to follow this path through the standing stones of our ancient past.",1363564800,,119,4.714285714285714
3785673,5,B001SGEUBK,Stonehenge move over. This is an intriguing documentary of the hundreds of human made stone formations around the British Isles. They are all over the place- both large and small. It shows rare finds that we would never have a chance to see if it were not for the good sports who filmed the trek.,1359417600,,296,4.4
3785674,5,B001SGEUBK,"So I rented this through my Netflix subscription, and like it so much I had to buy it!!!  The presenter goes from the south of England (Cornwall) to the very tip of Scotland, and even goes through out Ireland, and looks at a lot of the neolithic sights from standing stones to chamber tombs.  If your like me and find the Neolithic history of the British Isle then this is the the documentary that you should get for your library.",1358726400,3,430,4.3625
3785675,5,B001SGEUBK,This item was exactly what I had been looking for.  It was quickly mailed to me and arrived in excellent condition.  This is a keeper for my collection.,1352592000,,152,4.392857142857143
3785676,5,B001SGEUBK,"A movie which celebrates the human spirit.  The stuff that dreams are made on, that invisible thing inside all of us, that spirit somehow permeates this transcendental documentary like attending a religious service...without any mention of dogma, faith, psalm or prayer.  The spirituality of stone and landscape haunts our kind through thousands of years of generations here.  Beautifully filmed.  One could take away the deepest sense of beauty in this movie, even if not a word were spoken by it's narrator, Rupert Soskin.  The Tao of Sky and Stone.  Highly recommended.",1343088000,,572,5.230769230769231
3785677,5,B001SGEUBK,"We mostly hear about Stonehenge when dealing with ancient stone constructions in the UK.
I wanted to learn about the other stone structures. This DVD has it all. Well not EVERY stone construction in the UK since there are thousands. But it offers the most possible in two hours +.
I found it entertaining, enlightening, and very educational. The host offers up thoughts about what these ancient artifacts may have been used for based on the location and construction. The petrified wood giant post in one stone chamber was a surprise since everyone thought it to be stone. The bonuses on the DVD were also very interesting as they explain much more about what is thought about these structures, not to mention what they had to endure while taking 2 years to make this documentary. I say, ""Very well done guys""! They also cover Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland. A masterpiece!
Now I must buy the book! I plan on seeing some of these in person!",1336089600,4,947,4.710843373493976

3785679,5,B001SGEUBK,"This documentary is the very best of it's kind I've seen to date. The narrator is funny, smart, and not the stuffed shirt type I'd have expected. 5 stars all the way.",1307232000,,166,4.21875
8339805,5,B001SGEUBK,Great DVD with beautiful photography! Covers those little places you never hear about.,1501027200,,86,5.6923076923076925

8339808,5,B001SGEUBK,Best ever!!! Just returned from exploring Scotlands Stones..he addresses the mystery and total beauty of the ancient standing stone phenomena. Brilliant!  Komyozan.org,1476835200,,167,6.590909090909091

8339810,5,B001SGEUBK,"I got this DVD through my library, but now I'll be buying the book. It's one of the best and most engaging tours around the megalithic sites of the British Isles that I've come across  and perhaps the only worthwhile one on DVD. Some of the insights and commentary on the megaliths and ancient Britain in general are quite fascinating, in many cases somewhat challenging to conventional wisdom, and genuinely fresh and lively. As a bonus, it's a beautifully filmed extended look at some of Britain's most unique and remote countryside  Stonehenge excepted of course.",1470009600,,566,4.947368421052632
8339811,5,B001SGEUBK,"The narrator is insufferable at times, but this is still about the best whirlwind tour of a huge number of standing stone sites in the British Isles. It's hard to know how accurate the narrator's guesses are, but he is engaging and make you want to learn more (and to travel!).",1465084800,,277,4.450980392156863
8339812,5,B001SGEUBK,Love the book and love the DVD even more - just wish it was longer and included Stonehenge & Avebury - which they left out because they thought everyone was familiar with them.  If you are into Standing Stones - this is the DVD for you !,1433289600,,237,4.042553191489362
8339813,5,B001SGEUBK,A wonderful journey and very informative.,1423612800,,41,6.0
8339814,5,B001SGEUBK,"Really liked this DVD! I really reccomend this to anyone interested in prehistoric stone-age cultures of England, Ireland Scotland & Wales! I agree with some of the other comments about this video, it does leave you wanting to see more on particular stone circles, standing stones, & burial mounds! They did a good job though - they covered a alot - there is only so much you can show & talk about, when your covering many prehistoric sites! I think they need to make a another DVD, concentrating on particular prehistoric stone monuments, with more in-depth research & coverage!",1417392000,,579,4.858585858585859
