8013882,1,B0001KL4Q8,I can't call it disappointing because I had no basis of which to have any expectations. I think I smiled at one thing Guy said and giggled once or twice at Joe. There's nothing they said here that hasn't been said a thousand times over by countless comedians over the years.,1380844800,,274,4.392156862745098
