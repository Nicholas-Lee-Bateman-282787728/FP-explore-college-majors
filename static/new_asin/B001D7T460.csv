3526401,5,B001D7T460,"This DVD is one of the most valuable documentaries I have ever come across.  This documentary of research about stress involving humans and other mammals is quite surprising.  We are all the same.  Stress from other domineering individuals and society affects the health of each of us.  The ones that are being bullied, regardless of the species, will suffer and have poor health conditions and a shorter life span.  The bullies enjoy a better quality of health and longer life span.  What a strong message.

It took many years of research with humans and baboons to document and illustrate the harmful and destructive affects of stress that all animals on this planet are subjected to.",1242172800,2,686,4.913043478260869

3526403,4,B001D7T460,"This DVD shows how animal and human bodies are affected by stress, the harm and dangers. The threats especially to the brain, cardiovascular system and chromosomes are emphasized. Pregnant mothers under stress can transmit stress hormones into the fetus whose nervous system changes and in adult life becomes more prone to stress, stress related diseases and depression. The information here is based mostly on a Stanford University professor's study on baboons, who specializes in the neuropsychology of stress.

However, very little time is devoted to what to do about i.e. how to manage and reduce stress so that it doesn't become so lethal.",1236384000,54,644,5.252427184466019
3526404,5,B001D7T460,"This Video made me want to buy several copies to give to all of my family, friends and clients just as an ""I told you so!"".

I'm grateful to these folks that have been researching this topic for over 30 years. The information in their findings is truly amazing and will help the people of this world for many generations to come.

If your an information geek like me and like the Nat Geo type of work then you will certainly like this video.  It's very eye opening and useful information that should be shared with anyone who has Stress in their lives.",1233014400,,552,4.339805825242719
3526405,5,B001D7T460,"Stress researcher Prof. Robert Sapolsky (along with National Geographic) has produced a superb introduction to how Stress works and how best to cope with it.
A summation of his lifelong study of Stress, this video effectively delivers Sapolsky's personal perspective on Stress that may help you live a better, longer life.
Essential viewing in these (relatively) 'stressful' times.",1223424000,4,381,5.586206896551724
3526406,5,B001D7T460,"So, how is stress like ice cream? Well, a little now and then is ok, a triple serving may only make you temporarily sick, but ""all you can eat"" might kill you!

I've followed Robert Sapolsky's work for 10+ years and he definitely is the #1 expert on the effects of stress on the brain.

Prolonged, sustained, excessive stress and your similar response to it, not only causes deterioration of your brain, but it also compromises your immune system; your ability to fight off diseases.

Thousands of years ago, we mostly lived until we either starved, were accidentally poisoned or we were eaten by another animal. Now, we have the distinct ability to slowly kill ourselves over a period of about 80 years with chemical laced foods, too much alcohol and prolonged reaction to stressful events. All are avoidable, if we make the choice to do so.

Unfortunately, most of the people who really need the information in this documentary will never see it and the vast majority who do see it will ignore it. Only those determined to live a quality life for as long as possible will pay attention to this video.

At the present time, 1 in 4 of us will die in a state of dementia or with Alzheimer's. If you want to increase your odds against that happening, then buy this video, pay attention to it, re-watch it several times and invest in a scientifically proven brain fitness program. Not just crossword puzzles and Sudoku, nor any of the popular Name Brand games that mislead you to believe that they will improve your brain or memory. Invest in yourself with a research-based program that has been scientifically designed for the human brain, extensively tested on humans, published and peer-reviewed. The cost for such a program is minimal compared to being an invalid who not only can't find their car keys, but doesn't remember what they are for! For an introduction to the proper type of program that you should use, I suggest you watch, ""The Brain Fitness Program"" DVD featuring Peter Coyote.

If this video has piqued your interest in repairing your brain, maintaining your brain and improving you brain, then you will probably also enjoy reading the following -

""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers"" by Robert M. Sapolsky, Ph. D.

""Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain"" by Sharon Begley
""Brain Rules"" by Dr. John Medina
""Can't Remember What I Forgot"" by Sue Halpern
""The Brain That Changes Itself"" by Norman Doidge, M.D.

Most of the above are easily read without a medical or scientific background. The few parts that do get a little ""deep"" are short and should not keep you from finishing the book and understanding the message of the author. Some of the above are also available in Audio format.

So, again, I suggest that you buy this and put the information to use. You can add life to your years and years to your life!",1222214400,155,2845,4.6853707414829655

3526448,4,B001D7T460,"I watched this documentary with greater interest since it features baboons and I grew up around them in Africa. In fact one day when I walking up some stairs to hang up laundry I startled a baboon who was on the top of the roof. He jumped off the roof in front of me and ran screaming up the hill. I dropped my laundry and ran screaming back down the stairs. Needless to say a baboon and I caused each other a lot of stress that day. Even though now I think of the story as a funny experience.

The baboons I saw in the wild were normally looking for food and they liked our fruit trees and garden. I never saw them fighting, mostly roaming around. Anyway in this film you will be introduced to animals that used to have more stress in their lives. They have however learned a more peaceful way to live. The narrator makes the point that maybe we humans can learn something from the situation.

What I found interesting about this documentary was the explanation of how certain jobs are more stressful than others. Some jobs can make you fat and will kill you sooner.

The only thing this lacks is ideas to relieve stress which would have been helpful. For stress relief I can recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-De-Stress-Plan/dp/B000WTZ66C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The De-Stress Plan</a>

This is a fascinating documentary. It starts with a Stanford researcher's insights into stress hormones in baboons. His research shows that baboons can get their daily nutritional requirements in about three hours so they have the rest of the day to amuse themselves. As it turns out, the alpha baboons amuse themselves by terrorizing all the baboons beneath them in the hierarchy. The lower baboons do the same to those beneath them and so on. When the stress hormones of these baboons are measured, it turns out that the alphas have virtually no stress hormones in their blood while those lowest on the pecking order are totally stressed out.

But the really interesting finding comes from relating this baboon research to human bureaucracies. The baboon research is compared to a study of the British civil service which shows extraordinary parallels to the baboon research. As it turns out, the upper levels of the civil service have far less signs of stress than the lower levels of the civil service, since the lower levels have far less control over their fate and are constantly getting dumped on by those above them.

After establishing this fascinating comparison, the documentary goes on to describe some of the physiological effects of stress, which include such nasty things as unravelling chromosomes.

This is a fascinating documentary. It should be required viewing for anyone in labour relations, human resources, unions and by anyone who works in a bureaucratic organization.

This is extremely interesting material which could have a major impact on your health. Highly recommended.",1317686400,8,1718,5.187725631768953

Claudia Black

Robert Sapolsky began studying stress and its relation to high blood pressure, compromised immunity and increased depression in his 30s as a professor at Stanford. Sapolsky measures blood levels of adrenalin (epinephrine) and glucocorticoids (steriods) in primates in Africa. Alpha males in a baboon troop are constantly groomed (compare with hugging, massage), have first choice of females and food, and if irritable, terrorize females infants and subordinate males with bullying. Alpha male stress hormone levels are very low. Stress hormones in the blood increase corresponding with lower levels in troop hierarchy.

30 years of collecting primate blood samples shows the long reach of stress: the brain shrinks in memory and learning neurons of the hippocampus, blood adrenalin increases, blood pressure rises, heart disease develops, immunity declines (illness increases). Being bullied increases vulnerability to disease.

Dr. Marmot carried out a similar study in humans: the Whitehall study of British civil servants. Higher in the hierarchy officers enjoy health and well being. Subordinates experience increased heart disease, correlated with declining civil service rank. British socialized medicine provides identical care to everyone so access to care and treatment do not explain the differential health status. The lower in rank, the higher the risk of lowered immunity, increased sick days, high blood pressure and heart disease, increased stress hormones in the blood.

Dr. Shively studies arterial plaque in macaques who subject one another to social stress. Subordinates suffer increased atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries, wall thickening), plaque and heart attack in accordance with their place in the social psychological employment hierarchy.

Sapolsky first discovered the connection between brain shrinkage and blood levels of glucocorticoid and adrenalin at Rockefeller University. The hippocampus, the center of learning and memory shrinks in response to stress hormones. Chronic stress leads to a declining capacity to learn and remember. Acute stress (inadequate sleep, junk food, alcohol nicotine caffeine, unspoken anger, loneliness, fear of failure) makes you stupid.

Dr. Shively links stress, pleasure and dopamine, the brain chemical neurotransmitter connected with pleasure, by using PET scans (positron emission tomography measure of dopamine in the brain). CEO has lots of dopamine. Subordinates with less dopamine experience less pleasure.

Cardiologist Dr. Ritterman points out the correlation between socio-economic status (environment) and health. Those in dangerous neighborhoods are more hyper-vigilant, have more heart attacks, diabetes, obesity. Those who multitask are at greatest risk.

Solitude (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nell/dp/B00013RC84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nell</a>) and focused awareness on a single task eg meditation (DVD ASIN:B0040J1RZO Dhamma Brothers, book ASIN:1567319920 Wherever You Go, There You Are : Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life, book ASIN:0385303122 Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness) is associated with decreased stress.

Holland 1944, Dutch Hunger Winter women who conceived during the famine delivered 2400 babies. Fetal stress continues to scar babies now adults aged mid-60s: increased cardiovascular disease, increased cholesterol. Stress in pregnant woman permanently affects the fetus, not just fat cells; the brain's ability to learn, vulnerability to depression and other psychiatric disorders result. Human fetal stress continues to impact across the life span.

Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn studies telomere caps protecting DNA of 46 human chromosomes. As we age, telomeres fray and shorten. Mothers of disabled children have prematurely frayed and shortened telomeres. Length of the telomere is associated with stress duration and shorter life: decrease 6 years for each year caring for a disabled child. Threat of hope happens in support groups offering healing empathy, humor, longevity with nurturing compassion and connection with those sharing similar life stress.

30 years ago Sapolsky's baboon troop foraged in tourist garbage. Alpha males ate first, meat was tainted with tuberculosis. Half the males in the troop, all aggressive alpha males, died, leaving only subordinate males:females in a ratio of 1:2. Surviving troop males were socially affiliative, cooperative, non-aggressive. Non-alpha males engage in social grooming, don't dump on the females when angry. As adolescent males join from troops of their birth, they require 6 months to adapt to an affiliative social stance of this baboon troop culture. In the absence of alpha male stress, blood pressures decreased, blood levels of adrenalin and glucocorticoids declined. Within one generation, troop culture eliminated social-psychological stress and disease.

Antidotes to stress: find a situation where you feel you have control, where justice and equity prevail, where you are listened to, are welcome to become involved in decision making, are appreciated, feel empowered. Avoid displacing anger onto others, increase affiliative social support, increase generosity, laugh. Engage in daily yoga, Tai Chi, meditation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhamma-Brothers/dp/B0040J1RZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhamma Brothers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zen-Garden/dp/B00004Y2DV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zen Garden</a>) or other repetitive effortful mindfulness practice.

3526462,4,B001D7T460,"Good overview on stress that uses a healthy dose of evolutionary psychology, the discipline that connects human behavior to that of our evolutionary ancestors.  This is not the movie for those who believe that humans are unique and evolutionarily disconnected from our closest ancestors, the monkeys and apes.  It also emphasizes, indirectly, the affect of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone)on male behavior.  Recent human studies have shown that high testosterone males are not only at-risk for aggression, but they also seem to make the poorest mates.  Why?  They tend to be at risk for infidelity, since their ""drive"" for sexual variety and immediacy can supersede their interest in being monogamous.  Can this be seen in some monkeys and primates?  Chimps and bonobos aren't nice to each other, nor are baboons.  We can certainly add humans to this list.  This movie also looks at the pathophysiology of stress in an easy-to-understand way that make for intriguing viewing.  As college instructor who teaches health sciences, I recommend it for introductory A & P courses, Psychology majors, and Nursing programs.",1309132800,3,1129,5.292134831460674

3526465,5,B001D7T460,"This is an AMAZING DVD backed with scientific data of how stress damages us physically and emotionally.  We live in a stressful society where stress is killing us on an hourly basis.

One scientist stated that our society admires people who multitask and accomplish so much.  But that is actually very stressful.  She stated that we should admire people who have balanced and serene lives.  I agree with her.  What value does all this ""over achievement"" add to our lives, when it is killing us.

This is an excellent DVD, because it makes the viewer re-evaluate one's life and ask the all important question, ""What should we value in life to bring about the happiness we are all searching for?""

I highly recommend this DVD.",1296950400,17,724,4.736
3526466,5,B001D7T460,"This documentary is based on the pioneering work of Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky of Stanford.  The documentary talks about the dangers of stress on the human body and provides a background by getting into the Sapolsky's work with baboons in Kenya.  There was a dreadful incident which happended about 3 decades ago in the baboon troop Sapolsky was studying.  One year, he came to Kenya to discover that much of the baboon troop was killed off.  Later, he learned that most of them died due to the fact that they had eaten infected meat from a garbage dump.  What was astounding about this incident is that all of the alpha males had been killed off and only the beta males and females remained.  Another interesting finding is that this troop turned into a completely peaceful society... instead of males constantly fighting each other, they had males grooming each other.  As far as I know, this peaceful behavior lasted for generations and perhaps it is still going on now.  So what does this tell us?  If we want world peace, all of the alpha males in human society must die off, otherwise violence and stress will remain a fact of life.  This is the conclusion I have come to based on the baboon incident, no one in the video suggussed this.",1286150400,19,1247,4.65296803652968

3526474,4,B001D7T460,"The part that relates to real science, like the study of baboons, is excellent.  The main thesis of this documentary is well taken, that chronic stress harms all creatures. However, I have real issues with the parts where they use anecdotal evidence of their theories on human organizational hierarchies.

The hierarchical societies of baboons are fundamentally different from our workplaces.  For one thing, for baboons this permeates through their whole existence, while for most working people their jobs, well, are only their jobs.  The DVD shows a British civil servant who whines about a stressful situation at work, and the assertion is that his superiors do not share this type of stress.  Not so!

My own experience as an engineer who has been in the workforce for 30 years is totally the opposite of the assertions in this documentary.  The hierarchy of my typical workplace, which is typical, is like this:  A few technicians work for an engineer, who in turn reports to a middle manager, who reports to a vice president who reports to the CEO.

In my experience, the technicians are the least stressed, (the movie asserts that he is the most stressed like the subservient baboons). Even our CEO, which in this movie is likened to the dominant baboon, has to answer to the Board and the stock holders.

The typical technician appears at work in his tee shirt and jeans, punches the clock in and out, and if there is any overtime, he gets paid one and a half times his normal pay, (the rest of the characters in this story work overtime with no extra pay.)  He may take some c**p from the superiors occasionally, but he is generally not all that stressed in a typical work day.  He spends his leisure time hunting and fishing and has a grand time doing that.  He is a scoutmaster in his son's Boy Scout troop, (gets his hierarchical jollies there.)  If his health does not turn out as good as the rest, it would not be because of the stress of being at the bottom of the hierarchy.  It would be because his typical lunch is a Philly cheese steak with a large order of fries (and he smokes too); while the rest of the characters in our story have their lean turkey sandwich on rye with a salad.",1253836800,5,2203,4.584183673469388

Interestingly, such a dynamic runs parallel in humans given their place in occupational hierarchies. The nature of stress is an important topic that should be understood by educators, employers and by health care providers.
