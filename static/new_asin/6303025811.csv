7834382,3,6303025811,"Criminally Insane is one of my favorite halloween season treats and I just recently viewed the sequel and it's for Priscilla Alden fans only who don't mind rehashing the good old days, did I say re-hash? Who spends a great deal of time dreaming on the couch of her previous experiences come to haunt her. She's still up to her same old tricks with the new halfway house and at least that part is fresh material interwoven with her haunting recollections. I say it's worth a look see just to see the new crimes as well as reminisce about the old ones. She's still just as dastardly.",1506816000,,581,4.4392523364485985
7834383,1,6303025811,"What is Crazy Fat Ethel II? Well its the sequel to the 1975 Shlock horror film Criminally Insane, its a bad sequel at that. there is not even 30 minutes of new material, most of the movie including the credits (yes, the credits) are ripped from Criminally Insane which in turn look ripped from another movie due to the fuzzy boarder around the text....oh the days before photoshop. While Criminally insane was shot on 8mm film, this one is shot right on VHS, like movies considered to be this ones sequels, Death Nurse 1 and 2...both of which are mostly made up of stock footage of Criminally Insane and shot on VHS as well. The parts of Crazy Fat Ethel II which are new footage is juvenile (running in circles around a coffee table stuff), and not worth your time.",1310169600,,765,4.4714285714285715

OK, as a stand alone film for someone who hasn't seen Criminally Insane (the first film in this series) it's nonsensical but reasonable entertaining. Criminally Insane was a superb film for a budget of $30,000, grainy, eery and sheer entertainment. What could go wrong with the sequel? Well, it's not even a sequel!
Over 50% (seriously) of the film is flashback footage from Criminally Insane, crudely spliced in with no fade in/out. As the film itself barely scratches an hour long, that's under half an hour of fresh footage. Gone is the spooky Victorian looking house, gone are the bloody murders, gone is anything remotely scary and gone is (good for her though) half of Priscilla Alden's excess weight. So what's new with the film?
Taking out all the flashback footage, almost nothing. The film is filmed in Director Nick Millard's house which doubles in the film as a halfway house for three recently released mental patients (Ethel being one of them). As her diet is gradually restricted she starts a maniacal (-ly boring) killing spree, killing carers and patient(s). The killings in Crazy Fat Ethel Part 2 (or Criminally Insane 2 as is the real title) are not even half as bloody or exciting as in Criminally Insane. The script...well there's barely any dialogue, and the little there is is weak and poor (apart from the occasional out-of-the-blue would-be funny from Ethel). The visual and sound quality is ABSOLUTELY DIABOLICAL! If you thought Criminally Insane looked shoddy, wait until you see and hear this. Seriously; modern camera phones have better picture quality cameras! Every scene looks like a close up from a home-movie shot on super-low quality camcorders.
So where is the saving grace? To answer that we must look at the whole film, and I mean the new bits, not the flashback footage. Well, that's about 25 minutes worth. And you know what? It's almost all extended real time footage!! Literally, you will get 1 minute REAL TIME of Ethel eating a pudding. And you will get about two minutes (!) REAL TIME of a guy ladling dog food from 3 tins onto 4 plates, and masses of close ups of Ethel lying on the bed or smiling in the garden. There is nothing in the film to recommend itself, because there's basically no film!
To conclude, do not buy this! If you want to see CFE 2 (and believe me you don't 'cause there's nothing worth seeing) it comes as an extra on the Criminally Insane / Satan's Black Wedding double DVD. Don't buy the film independantly because it's a waste of cash. Watch Criminally Insane, its excellent, don't watch part 2 unless you really love the zero-budget genre because there's nothing to see but flashbacks. This film (if I can call it that) is just every death scene in Criminally Insane without the less exciting bits with even less exciting crappy-looking bits spliced in. A waste of time, sorry Priscilla.",1249776000,,2901,4.769383697813121
7834385,3,6303025811,"The Previous Review is actually for the film ""Truth or Dare"" and NOT for ""Crazy Fat Ethel"".  ""Crazy Fat Ethel"" is a sequel to the film ""Criminally Insane"" and features Priscilla Alden as the obese Ethel who goes on a killing spree,after being released from the mental hospital, when her grandmother locks up all of the food in the house.  She later murders her grandmother, the grocery boy, her doctor, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend.  The decomposing bodies lie around the house rotting while Ethel stuffs her face untill finally she can take no more and she consumes the bodies.  All of this is in the first installment but this film is merely a rehatch of the previous story consisting of WAY to much footage from the original film.  The film's ""Gimmick"" when released in theatres was to install a scale in the theatres where it played and any woman who weighed over 200 lbs was admitted to the film for free! Both ""Criminally Insane"" and ""Crazy Fat Ethel"" are sure to cure any and all compulsive over eaters out there.  This film is never to be confused with ""Truth or Dare"" which is a totally unrelated and much more dark and macabre story that was NOT released in the theatres but rather went straight to video and spawned 2 worthless and abissmal sequels...there is no man in an iron mask in this film...just a 350 pound murderous mound of flesh named ETHEL.",1094342400,2,1373,4.60655737704918
7834386,3,6303025811,"A friend of mine had it on tape in high school; I'm not sure how she came across it.  It's not good.  However, it IS a great movie to watch with your friends and raise boggled eyebrows as to the sheer idiotic logic, bad acting, and silly moments of schlock horror.  My memory is stretching here, but a few highlights: a game of ""Truth or Dare"" played by the side of the road which includes the quotation ""I dare you...to take your eye out...with THIS!"" (at which point the character pulls out a corkscrew like thingy and the other character indeed pulls her eye out with it...a prison mental ward where the inmates get to have a METALSHOP!!!...a car peeling out over the body of an infant...Twisted stuff...So enjoyably bad I can't believe it's not Troma.  We never have tracked down Crazy Fat Ethel part I...but if I remember correctly this version recaps it at the beginning...",1006560000,2,879,4.579617834394904
