4043303,3,B0030BS1HU,"ECW Heavyweight Champion Christian Vs. Ezekiel Jackson - I wouldn't call this a great opening bout but I will say this ECW Title match up was exceptionly good and was a good start to the night. Once the referee banned William Regal from ringside, the powerful Ezekiel Jackson dominated Christian and really doing a number on Christian's back. But after numerous attempts at the Kill Switch, Christian finally delivers it seemingly out of no where. Like I stated earlier, this bout is a good start to the 2010 Royal Rumble event. 3.5/5

United States Champion The Miz Vs. M.V.P. - After gaining the No. 1 contendership spot in a Fatal Four Way match weeks prior to this event, MVP finally gets his one on one shot against the Miz for the US Title. The Miz and MVP kept the ball rolling as they delivered another good match. This match stayed back and forth for a good while until it was the Miz able to retain his US Title after rolling up MVP for the victory. 3/5

WWE Champion Sheamus Vs. Randy Orton - These two kept the match pretty basic but pretty solid. While not all an interesting bout, the match accomplished what it was meant to do in establishing a stable champion in Sheamus and to create tension among the members of Legacy as the road heads towards WrestleMania. After scoring with a RKO, the referee DQ's Orton after an interference from Cody Rhodes which caused turmoil among the faction. But Sheamus on the otherhand, would get the final word while proving to everyone that he is indeed a force to be reckon with. 3.25/5

WWE Women's Champion Michelle McCool Vs. Mickie James - This was a short bout among the Divas but again, this match accomplished what it was set out to do. Allowing Mickie James getting revenge on Michelle McCool and becoming the WWE Women's Champion once again. 1/5

World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker Vs. Rey Mysterio - Surprisingly, Rey Mysterio did an excellent job standing tall against the monster known as the Undertaker. Early in the match, the Undertaker showed his powerful dominance until Mysterio was able to use his quickness and agility to counter the Undertaker and able to pull off certian maneuvers Mysterio is better known for while making the Deadman bloody in the process. Once Mysterio was gaining awesome momentum, the Undertaker shattered the ""dreams"" of Mysterio's where in the end it was the Undertaker able to walk away from the Royal Rumble still the World's Heavyweight Champion. 3.75/5

30 Man Over The Top Rope Royal Rumble Match - While this year's Royal Rumble had its moments, this Royal Rumble match stayed pretty much moderate throughout the course of the match. Unlike last year's match however, the Royal Rumble this year didn't stay a big cluster of superstars in the ring and it did a good job with the quick eliminations. CM Punk was this year's big heel in the Rumble who cutted promos after his eliminations until his elimination came courtesy of Triple H. Beth Phoenix making history and becoming the only second female to enter a Royal Rumble match and doing the unthinkable as she eliminated the Great Khali. However, the big story for this year's Royal Rumble was Shawn Michaels willing to do anything (including eliminating his DX partner, Triple H in the process) to win the match in order to face the Undertaker in a WrestleMania rematch. But in the end, it was the returning Edge last eliminating John Cena to gain victory and becoming the only third Canadian in WWE history to win a Royal Rumble match. 4/5

Overall, I found this Royal Rumble event a solid one but it isn't a must get right away. The highlights of the night being the World Heavyweight Title bout and the Royal Rumble match itself with the long awaited return of Edge. So in the end, this is a good event to check out and a very positive 2010 PPV start for the WWE.",1264982400,,3829,4.673590504451038
4043304,4,B0030BS1HU,"This was a good Royal Rumble ppv.  Aside from the squash divas match, every match was solid to good and the finish to the Rumble was a great surprise.  Personally, I feel like the road to WrestleMania has gotten off to a strong start, and I'm interested to see where they go from here, which is exactly what the Royal Rumble is supposed to accomplish.  Not the best Rumble ppv ever, but certainly a strong one, and one I would consider purchasing or at least renting.  This review does incluce SPOILERS, for those of you who do not wish to know the finishes do not read further.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. ECW Championship Match
Christian (c) vs. Ezekial Jackson

Surprisingly good opener, the fact that Christian got a good match out of Jackson should cement him as one of the better workers in the company.  I doubt Triple H could get a good match out of Jackson.  Anyway, it was a typical good Christian title defense, the likes of which we've seen on ECW many times, but that's not a bad thing at all.  Lots of near falls at the end, with Christian eventually hitting the Killswitch for the pin.  ***1/4

2. United States Title Match
The Miz (c) vs. MVP

This match was not originally scheduled on the card, but was added by Teddy Long (who somehow now has power over Raw superstars?) in a segment after the opening match.  Match was solid, with some good near falls at the end, but nothing outstanding.  Opener was better, shockingly.  Still a pretty good match though, Miz wins with a roll-up.  **1/2

3. WWE Championship Match
Sheamus (c) vs. Randy Orton

Match was pretty basic and not particularly interesting, but it accomplished what it set out to, which was to keep the belt on Sheamus and keep him looking strong, and continue the downward spiral with the Legacy.  Sheamus wins via DQ, after Cody Rhodes attacked him on the outside in front of the referee.  The post match was good stuff, which included Orton going crazy and attacking Rhodes, as well as Dibiase who came to the ring in Cody's defense.  Sheamus then takes out Orton with a Bicycle Kick to close the segment.  **

4. Women's Championship Match
Michelle McCool (c) vs. Mickie James

This match actually got a long video package detailing the ""piggy"" James fued, which shocked me because Divas matches never get video packages.  Anyway, Michelle came out and did her usual spiel on the mic, before Mickie came out and pinned her in about 20 seconds.  After the match, Mickie and the rest of the divas came out and humiliated Michelle.  The crowd liked it and it was good babyface revenge, I had no problem with any of this.  N/A

5. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Undertaker (c) vs. Rey Mysterio

Good Match.  Mysterio took a lot of bumps for Undertaker, and watching him being manhandled at times was very entertaining.  'Taker actually appeared to have broken his nose early on in the match, and it was bleeding pretty bad the rest of the way.  Strong finish, which showed Mysterio hit 2 consecutive 619s, only to be countered the third time into a MASSIVE Last Ride for the three.  ***1/4

6. Royal Rumble Match
Winner: Edge

This was a very entertaining Rumble Match.  Some early highlights included CM Punk eliminating several wrestlers, and when he was alone in the ring he would cut some funny promos.  In a suprise, Beth Phoenix became the second female ever to enter a Royal Rumble, and eliminated the Great Khali.  Triple H had a relatively early exit in the one, after being Sweet Chinned over the ropes by Shawn Michaels.  They did a good job this year by not clogging the ring, as there were a lot of quick eliminations which kept the amount of wrestlers in the ring to a minimum which provided for a lot more fast paced action.  Edge was the big surprise entrant at # 29, with Batista coming in at # 30.  The final four was Edge, HBK, Batista, and Cena, and they had a great few minutes of action.  Batista eliminated HBK while he was on the apron, and Cena low Bridged Batista who flew over the ropes himself.  It was then Edge who eliminated Cena to win the Rumble.  It wasn't the best Rumble Match I've seen, but it was highly entertaining throughout and the finish was exciting and unpredictable.  ***3/4

Overall I thought this was a very enjoyable Royal Rumble, and one I would consider adding to my dvd collection.  The Rumble came on last, as it should, and was the best match of the night.  The undercard wasn't half bad either, so if you get the chance check this one out.  In my opinion a strong start for WWE ppv in 2010",1264896000,3,4549,4.520245398773006
4043305,4,B0030BS1HU,"E. Jackson vs Christian (ECW World Title): Jackson had control through most of the match but once Christian started getting some momentum the match was over before you knew it, due to the Kill Switch.

  MVP vs the Miz (U.S Title): The Miz won with a Rollup and then got hit with MVP's move after the match, due to rubbing his victory in MVP's face.

  Randy Orton vs Sheamus (WWE World title): When Orton looked in control and had Sheamus hurting outside the ring, Cody Rhodes attacked Sheamus outside right in front of the ref. Then back in the ring Orton hit the RKO and went for the win, but of course right then and there the ref decided he was going to DQ Orton due to the interference. Orton then attacked Rhodes and Ted D. came in to calm Orton down, but got attacked as well. Orton then turned into a big boot to the face by Sheamus.

  Mickey James vs Michelle McCool (Women's Title): In a short match, Mickey first attacked Layla who was dressed like a fat pig version of Mickey James once again. In the ring, Mickey quickly beat Michelle with her DDT after Michelle kicked Layla in the face off the apron on accident. After the match Mickey celebrated her title win by having the Maria and others bring out a big cake, she then smashed it over Layla and Michelle's faces.

  Rey vs Undertaker (World title): In a the best match of the night Rey had Undertaker's nose bleeding all over due to reversing a lot of Undertaker's moves with kicks to the face. Rey looked in control when he hit Taker with the 6:19 kick from one side of the ring and then on the other side of the Ring. But Undertaker won after catching Rey with the Last Ride, which is the same way Taker beat Rey years back on Smackdown when he was biker Undertaker.

  The Royal Rumble: Evan Bourne and Dolph Zigglar started out in the Rumble. They were joined by CM Punk who eliminated both men and then had fun talking on the mic in between a few eliminations by Punk. But then he was eliminated by Triple H. HBK was in through most of the Rumble and even eliminated HHH with Sweet Chin Music. I was rooting for HBK, because I thought if he was eliminated, that Cena would no doubt win. But Cena and HBK didn't win.

  HBK was eliminated by Batista and didn't take it well. Batista was then eliminated by Cena and the surprise entry eliminated Cena. The surprise entry was Edge! and he won the Rumble. Thank God! Cena didn't win but come on, I'd like to see fresher faces win the Rumble and go to WM. Kofi Kingston and John Morrison deserve their turns! I'm glad Edge won over Cena, but I'm sure the mixed breed of a monkey and a donkey will make his way into one of the WM World Title matches some how. Edge vs Sheamus would be fresh, but I'm sure we'll get Edge vs Cena instead. Cena will most likely leave Elimination Chamber as Champ this month!",1264896000,,2825,4.3081285444234405
4043306,3,B0030BS1HU,"""Royal Rumble 2010"" is nothing special.  Plain and simple.  Most of this PPV lacked originality, and by the end of the broadcast, I was underwhelmed.

1) ECW Championship
Christian (champion) v. Ezekiel Jackson
---Undoubtedly the best match on the card, and I think the Atlanta crowd's participation will confirm that.  I confess I haven't watched the SyFy program in a long while, but I think I will give it another look if it's going to produce solid matches like this.  Christian has always been a great in-ring performer, but Jackson really stepped up to the plate.  For some reason, his brutish strength is more appealing than most superstars with this kind of dominant gimmick.  The action was back-and-forth, with both men coming up with some good counters to familiar spots.  The pace was always quick, and the slower moments were still intense.  I am very surprised at how much I enjoyed this match, and look forward to these two mixing it up some more.
""7.0 / 10""
________________________________________

2) United States Championship
The Miz (champion) v. MVP
---This match was added to the card because Teddy Long tired of Miz's backstage cockiness.  Well...actually I later learned it was because of the squash Women's Championship Match, but more on that later.  I like how The Miz has come along in recent months, and MVP usually entertains me.  But tonight, these two seemed off.  Miz was in top form, when he used his quick offense to impress the crowd, or when he sold MVP's attacks as well as he did.  But MVP somehow didn't impress me.  Even the Atlanta crowd started to cheer for Miz, especially when MVP's ""babyface revenge"" failed to get some fan sympathy.  The match was pretty short, and it's not bad or anything.  Just unremarkable.
""5.5 / 10""
________________________________________

3) WWE Championship
Sheamus (champion) v. Randy Orton
---This is a strange match to talk about, for a few reasons.  First off, there were some neat backstage segments where Orton had heard from Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase (separately) that the other was acting odd.  Because of this, Orton decided to compete alone.  Another strange factor is that we have two villain characters who are forced to somehow entertain a crowd, when neither has deserved any kind of heroic sympathy.  It's a tough feat, and I credit the two men for trying.  Did they pull it off?  To me, they did.  The physical showdown was a believable performance from both men, with sensible & patient strategy.  But I think after Atlanta realized that Randy Orton refused to acknowledge their strong cheers --- true to his character, by the way --- the crowd lost interest until the end.  I've heard many interviews from Orton, where he admits that he likes when people chant ""Boring"", and likes making a crowd agitated.  I thought Orton's use of psychology was excellent; Sheamus again bores me as a character, but entertains me as a competitor.  The disqualification finish will annoy most people, but I see it as a sign of things to come.  I like this match, but I won't recommend to anybody.
""7.0 / 10""

4) Women's Championship
Michelle McCool (champion) v. Mickie James
---After a well-done video package and some smacktalk from McCool, we are treated a match that lasted less than 1 minute.  Now, I normally hate squashes.  I would've preferred a longer match from my two favorite Divas currently in the WWE.  But frankly, I thought this victory from Mickie James was short and sweet.  It was time for the ""Piggie James"" storyline to have its happy ending.  I know this was a bait-and-switch from the WWE, but I was alright with it.
""No Score""
________________________________________

5) World Heavyweight Championship
Rey Mysterio v. The Undertaker (champion)
---This title bout has the right beginning, and the right ending, but is missing the middle.  You will get to see Mysterio's struggle to gain an advantage over the larger Undertaker.  You will get to see Mysterio's inspiring comeback, and Undertaker's impressive victory.  Unfortunately, this match was missing that middle chapter, where you see Taker and Mysterio gain a series of advantages in order to make us believe that the championship is on the line.  I've become sick of the shorter Undertaker matches; his health and age are no longer an acceptable excuse for me.  This problem has made challengers like CM Punk, Batista, and Rey Mysterio look unimpressive, when all of those men are capable of entertaining the crowd.  It is time for Undertaker to have his marquee matches free from the championship spotlight.  This ""SmackDown"" main event is good while it lasts, but we deserved and expected more.  And why the hell was Batista in the pre-match video when he never made an appearance?
""6.5 / 10""

6) 30-Man Royal Rumble
---These Rumbles are hard to evaluate, so let me tell give you the Pros/Cons list.

PROS
* CM Punk was easily the best part of the Rumble.  He entered at #3, and used his Straight-Edge Society propaganda on numerous occasionss.  He tried to convert a few, and he ended up suckering a few.  If you remember Diesel's impressive 1994 appearance, or Steve Austin's 1997 dominance, then this will be a fun treat for you.

* Beth Phoenix became the first woman to enter the 30-Man Rumble since Chyna's 2000 appearance.  It was a short but very sweet showing.  How she eliminated The Great Khali is one for the history books.

* Some of the newer talent to the Royal Rumble got to show off a bit.  Dolph Ziggler, Evan Bourne, Kofi Kingston, R-Truth, and of course CM Punk made an impression.  Granted, these appearances were mostly short ones, but they were the most memorable.

* The DX showdown between Shawn Michaels and Triple H was thankfully not held off until the very end of the Rumble.  Unlike a lot of this 30-Man Rumble, the timing was unpredictable.

* I credit WWE for not taking the obvious route of having Shawn Michaels win the Royal Rumble to get the much-anticpated HBK/Taker ""WrestleMania"" rematch.  I have no doubt we will see it.  I believe most fans believe it will happen anyway.  And HBK's final role in the contest was memorable.

* Edge is back!  One of the greatest performers in pro wrestling history has returned months before he was rumored to be healed from his injury.  Although there was a been-there-done-that feeling, seeing the Ultimate Opportunist sneak into another victory is always a pleasure.

CONS
* About halfway through the 30-Man Rumble, there was very little pileup of wrestlers.  At the most, you'd see 4 men in the ring from about #19 onward.  I was disappointed to see this happen, because the past few Rumbles had a lot of exciting action with tons of guys in the ring.  This time, they took a page out of the 2002 Rumble in Atlanta...fewer guys in the ring.  Both times, I've been underwhelmed.

* John Cena was F___ing HORRIBLE!  He got his tail whipped for pretty much the entire match, and the fact that he was the last guy eliminated is criminal.  He tried the Attitude Adjustment like 8 times.  He barely got any offense in.  I like John Cena, but this was an embarassment.

* Nothing ever resulted from Legacy's involvement in the Orton/Sheamus title bout.  Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase just entered the Rumble, competed like a tag team, and got eliminated like a tag team.  I wish their participation earlier in the evening would've resurfaced in some way.

* Quite frankly, the action got stale towards the end.  Big Show and Mark Henry made little use of their giant-vs-giant showdown.  A handful of eliminations were sloppy, espeically the most pivotal one in the match: Shawn Michaels'.  No one really got to be the ""star"" of the Rumble, except for CM Punk in the early part of the Rumble.  Gifted veterans like Chris Jericho and HBK didn't get much of a reaction out of me, while some other reliable guys like Batista and John Cena lacked a spark.  Edge's surprise return (good as it was) didn't involve much action from him because he entered at #29.

I think my overall reaction to the 30-Man Royal Rumble is that it started great, with some creative action and humorous spots.  But then about halfway, it became a plodding affair with quick eliminations and no real rhythm to it.  I felt like the 2010 Rumble was on cruise control.

OVERALL
""Royal Rumble 2010"" continues two WWE PPV trends: familiarity and averageness.

You've seen this stuff before.  An ECW Title Match that won't matter much after all is said and done.  Impromptu matches that don't really entertain.  A WWE Championship showdown ending in disqualification.  Undertaker delivering another shorter PPV appearance.  A squash match that develops storylines more than delivering the anticipated in-ring action.
Everyone responds differently to the 30-Man Royal Rumbles, but I was disappointed.

The PPV's quality was middle of the road.  You're not thankful for spending your money on the event, and you're not angry to demand a refund.  You admire the effort, but condemn the shortcomings.  It's sad to see my love for WWE start to diminish.",1264896000,5,9181,4.905071521456437

ROYAL RUMBLE 2010

1.[ECW TITLE] CHRISTIAN VS EZEKIEL JACKSON-the opening match would pit Christian against the bigger Jackson. The match was as one would expect with Christian having to use his speed while Jackson dominated with strength.  Jackson looked really good here as did Christian as he always does, really good opening match. The pace was good and the chemistry between them was on point as well. Christian ends up hitting his finisher for the win.

2.[U.S. TITLE] THE MIZ VS MVP-now like I always say I am a fan of The Miz so any time he is wrestling I am watching. I also liked M.V.P. who got this title shot on the spot as Teddy Long added the match a short time earlier. Both were good in this but not as good as they could have been together. Luckily they had some really good matches later but on to this one. The match while not the best was good with M.V.P. getting off to a good start taking it to Miz. But Miz would come back at the end keeping his title with a nice roll up or as I like to say, small package.

3.[WWE TITLE] SHEAMUS VS RANDY ORTON-this one had a great led in that night with Legacy members Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase talking to Randy. The thing that made it great was how they came to him separate, and well it was good. This was another good match with both guys getting in some good shots at each other. They take it to each other like good heels do targeting body parts and such. As with the conversations Orton had earlier with legacy that comes into play as Cody comes down. He then of course gets involved which gets Randy DQ'd, that of course leads him to attack Cody.

4.[WOMEN'S TITLE] MICHELLE MCCOOL VS MICKIE JAMES-I don't know what other people think but I loved LayCool to be honest. They are the funniest Divas of all time, they just make me laugh with their mic skills. Any way as far as action this one is not all that long after we get a good intro involving ""Piggy James"". The match is over like a minute or something later with Mickie standing tall as new champ.

5.[WORTLD TITLE] THE UNDERTAKER VS REY MYSTERIO-now of course we all get the idea behind this match, the little guy vs the big guy [David vs Goliath] concept which is always fun. The match goes as I had expected with Taker dominating with his power tossing Rey every where. Then we get the come back against all odds in Rey as he is just so close to pulling off the upset. Great action form both as Taker just takes it to Rey and Rey tries to break Taker down. The ending is great as Rey hits two 619's but in going for a west coast pop gets to take a trip on the Last Ride. Also it was good to see Taker get a bit bloody, makes him look even more evil.

6. ROYAL RUMBLE-now we get to the match that every one wants to see and never disappoints. For me there is nothing more fun in wrestling than a battle royal so I love it no matter what. Now of course the story here was Shawn Michaels trying to win to get that rematch with Taker. Of course CM Punk is great here in the Rumble and is hilarious with his Straight Edge preaching and performance. I loved him trying to convert participants during the match. Also Beth Phoenix eliminating Great Khali the way she did but I also like her taking it to Punk and eating a ""Go to Sleep"". Beth is one of the few Divas who can actually wrestle and is one of my all time favorites.

Also it was cool seeing Carlito just because I miss him spitting apple on people. My favorite moment though is HBK super kicking Triple H over the top rope. This of course is not the first time he has eliminated one of his best friends with some Sweet Chin Music. But in the end it is the returning Edge who would go on to win the Rumble crushing my dreams at the time of HBK/Taker 2 although I knew it was still going to happen. But I always want Shawn to win so you know what I mean.

Over all this was a good event but I always do enjoy the Rumble event because I love battle royals so much. If you have yet to see this then I do recommend checking it out since I did like it. Try getting the two pack with the previous years Rumble since you get for the price of one. Still wish Shawn would have won this match, oh well. The special feature for the DVD is the confrontation between Bret Hart and Vince from Raw.",1312156800,2,4267,4.156174334140436

4043310,3,B0030BS1HU,The best match on the card was the World's title match between The Undertaker & Rey Mysterio mainly because of their performances. The worst match was the U.S title match between The Miz & MVP mainly because it was rushed and poorly booked. The Royal Rumble match was too short and the quality was so-so at best. The highlight of Rumble bout was Egde's victory. The rest were ok. I give this event a 7 out of 10.,1276560000,,412,4.294871794871795
4043311,2,B0030BS1HU,"2010 has been a weak year for the WWE and the annual Rumble PPV starts off the year with the same old crap.

ECW Champion Christian VS Ezekiel Jackson: I miss ECW. Sure it wasn't good as the original, not by a long shot. However, the introduced new stars and kept them in the spotlight before shipping them off to Smackdown or Raw. This was a slow match that I didn't enjoy.

Miz VS MVP: A decent little match but looks like something you'd see on Raw rather then a PPV. I did like the ending but it looked very weak.

Sheamus VS Randy Orton: I hated this match. It just enchanced the break up of Orton/Legacy.

Mickie James VS Michelle McCool: Hard to believe James and Maria are gone from WWE. Anyways, I didn't care to watch this.

Rey Mysterio VS Undertaker: Typical Mysterio match, big man vs little man. Undertaker has been in pain for some time now and just needs time to heal rather then be giving a world title run. This is the only match in all my years of watching WWF where it looks like a rehearsal rather then a match. It had its moments but it would have been better if both men were 100%.

Rumble Match: Bourne and Ziggler start off with a great back-and-fourth encounter. I'd love to see these two men face off in a one-on-one match. My favorite wrestler, CM Punk, comes in at three and eliminates both men. He grabs the microphone and talks, which is pretty funny. Beth Phoneix comes in as the second woman to wrestle in the Rumble and kisses Khali, both of them fall on the floor. Triple H comes in and the push of Punk is about to stop, I will admit Triple H getting out of the go to sleep was a cool move. The Rumble goes on but nothing really special happens. Miz attacks MVP for no reason, considering he won the match between them earlier. MVP returns and eliminates Miz and the Rumble chugs on. It's hard to belive that the year is half over and how many wrestlers aren't with WWE anymore. Shawn Micheals did a good job showing emotion over being eliminated. Edge makes a surprise returns and if you didn't guess he'd be the winner, then you must be new to the WWE because mostly everything in WWE is predictable.

Overall, the first WWE PPV of the year is a stinker. I wouldn't recommend this PPV to anyone.",1275350400,,2233,4.302380952380952
4043312,3,B0030BS1HU,"ECW Champion Christian vs. Ezekel Jackson - This was a real solid opening match as we all know what Christian is capable of but Ezekel Jackson stepped it up here in getting himself over as a powerman that all about what his entrance music implies...Domination.  Ezekel overpowered Christian various times throughout the match causing Christian to play defense, use his speed, & take high risk to get an advantage.  It was a solid opening match & good showcasing for Jackson even in defeat as they would go on to have better matches (like their Extreme Rules match on the final ECW broadcast) but one funny moment was Matt Striker bringing up a note in the history of the ECW Championship to no immediate responce from the others leading to Michael Cole saying, ""I'm trying to forget that moment.""
As a side note, this would end up being the last ECW match on PPV as WWE ended the brand right before the next PPV.

United States Champion The Miz vs. M.V.P. - Eventhough this was building for the previous month, this was a last minute bonus match.  M.V.P. dominated early before Miz was able to recover with these two going back & forth against each other before Miz was able to pull out a win in another solid match...but the biggest highlight of this match was the aftermath between these two that ensured that we didn't see the last of this issue between these two men.

WWE Champion Sheamus vs. Randy Orton - Before the match, Orton told Ted Dibiase that he didn't want Legacy getting involved in his match based off the conversations he had with Rhodes & Dibiase seperately earlier in the night.  This was a rare ""heel vs. heel"" match for the championship that saw the crowd starting to favor Randy Orton over Sheamus.  Both men focused on a body part such as Sheamus' ankle & Orton's arm to the point where his arm was rammed into the steel steps.  Cody's appearence (remember, he told Dibiase for them to not get involved...he didn't tell Cody) cost Orton the match resulting in Orton taking it out on Legacy before Orton would be left laying himself.

Womens Champion Michelle McCool vs. Mickie James - All I can say here is that after all the ""Piggy James"" comments & actions from both McCool & Layla, they got exactly what they deserved.  Just think of this match as the female version of Ultimate Warrior vs. Honky Tonk Man.  If your looking for an actual match...check out their encounter from the month before at T.L.C.

World Champion Undertaker vs. Rey Mysterio - Just by looking at these two, you got the type of match expected here in that it was ""David vs. Goliath"" and just like usual when Mysterio plays the ""David"" role, he puts up one hell of a fight.  Taker showcased his superior power early by just tossing Mysterio over the top in the opening moments & blocking Mysterio's high flyin' moves.  Mysterio did the old Bret Hart strategy by working on Taker's legs, maked Taker's nose bleed from various kicks to the face, and even hit two 619's before he got caught with the Last Ride.  This was the best non-Rumble match of the night & was a good encounter.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - As usual, WWE put together a great ""by the numbers"" video package featuring facts & highlights from the previous Rumble matches.  Various moments such as C.M. Punk preaching during the match, the interaction between Punk & Great Khali & Beth Phoenix, Miz & M.V.P. picking up where they left off earlier, Legacy working together, Shawn fighting to get his match against Undertaker at WrestleMania...at ANYONE'S expense, Mark Henry's slam on Big Show, and the ""Rated R"" return.  This was one of the best Rumbles in recent history as it had plenty of stories, action, and entertaining moments in the match that just came together perfectly.

DVD extras include the confrontation between Bret Hart & Mr. McMahon the next night on RAW.  In the end, this event resembled the earlier Royal Rumbles where the undercard matches were solid but nothing memorable as a majority of these matches (except the World Title) weren't the best encounters in their series of matches while the Rumble itself was the highlight of the night.  Bottom line, this was worth a rental but if your a diehard fan of the Rumble match then go ahead & pick it up.",1271808000,2,4239,4.640374331550802

overall I thought the 2010 royal rumble was not too bad. the wwe championship match was better than i exected due to some great ring psychology by randy orton. the ecw match was a good opener, really felt like cristian was just worn out after the match. the world title match was probably the best out of the title matches. won't even get into the women's title match. the rumble itself was good, but there have been better. too many big names all at the end of the match.",1267833600,,551,4.3076923076923075

(C)CHRISTIAN VS EZEKIEL JACKSON

THIS WAS A PRETTY SOLID MATCH FOR A LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT AND A SUPER HEAVYWEIGHT, JACKSON CONTROLED MOST OF THE MATCH
AND HIT SOME PRETTY SOLID POWER MOVES ON THE OTHERHAND CHRISTIAN HAD SOME NICE SPOTS AS WELL, IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO
KICK OFF THE NEW YEAR IN ECW WITH A PRETTY GOOD MATCH.
(RATING - 7.5/10)

UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP
(C)THE MIZ VS MONTEL VONTAVIOUS PORTER

I WAS SHOCKED THAT MVP DIDN'T COME OUT WITH THE VICTORY, THE MIZ HAS BEEN DOING PRETTY GOOD AS US CHAMP, HE HAS BEATEN EVERYONE SO FAR, THIS MATCH WAS NO DIFFERENT ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE BY THESE TWO ATHLETES, NOT AS GOOD AS
SOME OF THE OTHER MATCH, BUT STILL PRETTY SOLID, THE BEST PART WAS AFTER THE MATCH WHEN MVP ATTACKED MIZ
(RATING - 6.0/10)

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
(C)UNDERTAKER VS REY MYSTERIO

THIS MATCH BLEW THE ROOF OFF THE DOME IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, AN UNBELIEVABLE MATCH, NOW I THOUGH UNDERTAKER IS HUGE
AND REY MYSTERIO IS TINY, AND IT WOULD END IN LIKE 5 SECONDS, BUT REY DID REALLY WELL, THIS MATCH EXCITED ME AND
KEPT ME INTERESTED, ESPECIALL WITH THE DOUBLE 619.
(RATING - 8.5/10)

WOMENS CHAMPIONSHIP
(C)MICHELLE MCCOOL VS MICKIE JAMES

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS ONE, THESE TWO BOTH HAD A PRETTY GOOD MATCH AT TLC, BUT THEN AFTER WEEKS OF EMBARRASMENT, MICKIE JAMES COMES OUT AT THE ROYAL RUMBLE AND BEATS MICHELLE MCCOOL IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS DIVAS MATCH, BUT I WAS TERRIBLY DISSAPOINTED, BUT STILL IT WAS A LITTLE FUNNY
(RATING - 2.0/10) (FOR THE ENDING WITH THE CAKE IN MCCOOL'S FACE)

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
(C)SHEAMUS VS RANDY ORTON

THIS WAS ANOTHER MATCH THAT EXCITED ME AND KEPT ME IN IT THE WHOLE WAY, OF COURSE CODY RHODES HAD TO STICK HIS NOSE
WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG AND RANDY ORTON GOT DISQUALIFIED FOR IT, RANDY ORTON PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON THIS MATCH IF IT
WASN'T FOR LEGACY, AFTER THE MATCH RANDY ORTON SNAPPED ON LEGACY AND SHEAMUS KICKED ORTON IN THE FACE, BUT IT WAS
A REALLY GOOD 15 MINUTE MATCH
(RATING - 9.0/10)

2010 ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH

THIS WAS A PRETTY GOOD ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH, BUT IT WASN'T THE BEST, AFTER CM PUNK GOT ELIMINATED IT STARTED TO HEAT
UP, SHAWN MICHAELS ELIMINATED TRIPLE H WITH SWEET CHIN MUSIC, EDGE MADE A SURPRISE RETURN TO WIN THE RUMBLE MATCH,
AND BATISTA ELIMINATED SHAWN WHICH WAS A HEART BREAKER, SO NOW EDGE IS GOING TO WRESTLEMANIA 26!!!!!!!

Stone Cold Steve Austin Had That Record But With The 6 Eliminations Shawn Michaels Had In 2010 He Had Moved Past Austin In That Record! Another Accomplishment A Decade after The Late Chyna We Saw a 2nd Female Enter This Thing In Beth Pheonix and In more Ways Than one Had a Very Big Accomplishment In Her Own Way Eliminating The Great Khali! And You Sort of Felt Sorry for Khali Cause That Becomes a Scarlet Letter on His WWE Career It Was Clear He Wasn't Going To Hit A Woman, CM Punk of Course was Another Story. I Would Have Like to Have Seen Beth Pheonix Lasted a Lot Longer in The rumble Than She Had With Triple H And John Cena And Edge So That Was A Huge Bummer In This Rumble!

8385656,3,B0030BS1HU,"The first WWE PPV of the new decade we live in today and the 23rd annual Royal Rumble in wrestling history.
The opening match of the night is for the WWECW Championship, Christian beats Ezekiel Jackson (Lucha Underground: Big Ryck) to retain.

At least Michelle McCool got what she deserved, because Mickie James finally got her revenge over her and Layla (not to be confused with the other one from Winx Club) and win the Women's Championship before her friends and the Bella Twins humiliated those bullies.

Some of the other matches such as Undertaker vs. Rey Mysterio and Sheamus vs. Randy Orton are so-so. Decent I guess, but back then I was away from WWE programming during the last 8 years.

It's okay. It's so good to see Edge come back and win that Royal Rumble by eliminating John Cena last. That's the only moment that matters!",1448236800,,838,4.648648648648648

OVERALL THOUGHTS.
I thought this was a fun pay-per-view. From the opening match to the main event, except the Women's title match up. Royal Rumble's are always fun. Awesome to see Edge return and win it all. World and WWE title matches delivered, at least I think so. Mysterio and Taker was fun to watch.

7/10 stars. P.S. The Bluray exclusives are awesome too. The RAW & SD! episodes before the big event.",1380240000,,781,5.150793650793651
