5669793,4,B00BSE8NDI,"They took some liberties with the story (15).  We haven't viewed (16) yet.  While the scenery was gorgeous, it didn't look like the pictures of Brunetti's terrace was taken from the area where D. Leon says he lives, rather the scenery looked like it was taken from the Guidecca.  Also, there had been no hint  that we'd have to read subtitles.  It should have been dubbed!  As always with a film
made from a book one has read, the characters did not look as I had imagined.  I think Brunetti was  more fastidious in dress and
kind in demeanor than in this film.  Still, we liked it.",1370563200,,582,4.364485981308412
5669794,5,B00BSE8NDI,"Only criticism--disconcerting to hear German language set in divine Venice.  However, the cast is great and one gets used it.",1369958400,,125,5.25
5669795,5,B00BSE8NDI,"Guido and Paola Brunetti are two of the most compelling and believable characters in these mysteries. You will enjoy them all, but there are some cautions. First, some of the mysteries are not ""solved"" in the sense that some culprit is rightfully brought to trial and imprisonment. Second, some of the plots may actually cause you considerable worry and sorrow, although they all include at least a bare minimum of occasional humor. Finally, I am not fluent in Italian, and most of the actors in these mysteries are native speakers of German, which is the language used for the DVDs. Fortunately, clear English subtitles are used throughout, with relatively few glitches. Nevertheless, I found myself listening to the German rather than reading the English, and since the locale is Venice, I sometimes suffered a measure of cultural dislocation. But that is minor. You will definitely enjoy these mysteries no matter what your native tongue.",1368057600,8,941,5.116883116883117
5669796,5,B00BSE8NDI,These movies are great!  I've seen every one of them and recommended them to friends.  I've been saving the very last one for viewing because once I've seen them all I will be so sad that there are no new ones to watch.  I'll just have to watch them over again and again.,1395360000,,271,4.0754716981132075
5669797,1,B00BSE8NDI,"What was Leon thinking?  Impossible even with the sound on mute.  Language wrong, body movements wrong, even the haircuts are wrong.",1384992000,,132,5.238095238095238

5669799,5,B00BSE8NDI,"These murder mysteries are set in Venice, but all of the actors speak German - however, English subtitles follow along.  There is much humor woven into all of the stories in this series.",1375315200,2,186,4.636363636363637

5669804,5,B00BSE8NDI,The mysteries are filmed in such intriguing locations in and around Venice.  It's like a trip to secret places of the city,1371168000,,122,4.545454545454546
5669805,5,B00BSE8NDI,Over the years we have enjoyed the series by Donna Leon and have listened to most of her stories on CD. We were happy to finally get the German TV drama. The stories are difficult to read for me as I don't enjoy when I can't pronounce a lot of the words. The TV series brings the stories to life.,1370908800,,296,3.95

8573249,5,B00BSE8NDI,Found the books in a small bookstore in Venice 10 years ago and have read them all. So excited to have the DVDs and I have the complete series. They follow the books very well. Love the scenery. Their apartment is very close to the apartment we rent. Actors are perfect. Wish they were in Italian,1466035200,,296,4.303571428571429
8573250,5,B00BSE8NDI,"Liked this so much.  After Montelbano, I wasn't sure I would enjoy this....especially since it is in German rather than Italian.  It was very good and I enjoyed the background in Venice.  I will probably order another in this series.",1455148800,2,233,4.775
8573251,5,B00BSE8NDI,"A bit weird hearing them speaking German in Venice, but Ms Leon doesn't let these stories be translated into Italian.",1454198400,,117,4.9
