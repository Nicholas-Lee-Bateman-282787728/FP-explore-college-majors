8663350,3,B00L22HI7S,"Sima  (Palmer Davis) is a 32 year old washed up dancer who scores a job as a teacher with her class in balance of being lost if one student drops out.  She teaches a somewhat diverse group of kids who seem to know dance already. She has to deal with conflict and anyone who has seen ""Footlosse"" knows the formula.  Sima is of Iranian decent and deals with conflict at home.

The film is far from gritty.  The conflict was fairly docile. There is a hall fight with some pushing and we see bruises on a couple of people from domestic abuse, something that goes nowhere.  The script was rather weak. If you want to see kids dance, then this is a great film. If you are looking for a plot for adults, this isn't it.  The film might work for the tween crowd.
