8720581,1,B00ZPT4NXQ,"I own a ton of yoga dvds and practice at home and studios frequently. I enjoy a variety of styles. This one is my least favorite. Boring, terrible flow and not very good with breath related to asanas. Doing both back to back is not any more beneficial that individually. Very disappointed. Waste of money. Waited too long to try it to get refund.",1490227200,,346,4.421875
