4309570,4,B004AILAFC,"Terence Hill continues the adventures of 'DOC WEST' in this direct sequel to the original.  The same characters return with the same actors with a surprise appearance by Euro actress Ornella Muti making it seem Hill may be creating a potential series.  It seems our hero is still in the town of Holy Sands and is running out of money to send to his daughter so West's inamorata who is the teacher in town suggests building a hospital.  Naturally, it takes money so it doesn't take long for West and the Sheriff played excellently by Paul Sorvino to set up a major poker tournament so that West, the best poker player in the area, can clean up and win. Naturally, their are bad guys around to put a wrench in the proceedings which makes this outing a bit grittier than the first film.  However, the sentimentality is still there and the credits including the continuation of Maurizio De Angelis's great music score are up to the standards of the original.  If you liked the first one (like I did), you'll love this one.  It's worth it just to see the great Terence Hill looking comedic and lethal in the same shot and bringing honor and loyalty back to the Western genre. Doc, you rule!!",1295740800,17,1186,4.518691588785047
4309571,2,B004AILAFC,"A drifter (Hill) comes back to the town of Holy Sand and wants to help the locals by building a hospital, but needs money.  In the sequel to Doc West (not necessary but helpful to watch first), Doc West (Hill) is still in high demand as a doctor.  After half the town gets hurt in a bar fight he realizes its time to open up a hospital.  He turns to the only way he knows in order to make money, a poker tournament.  When an evil Dutchman rides in to town, (to compete and stop West from getting the money he needs) West must decide what is more important, the money or love.  If you liked the first one you will probebly like this one as well.  For me, low budget TV movies with bad acting are not my thing. I give it a D+.",1295049600,5,724,3.9586206896551723

4309584,3,B004AILAFC,Not a bad little western but though the lead cowboy/gunslinger/doctor and poker player extraordinaire totally looks the part he has a Norwegian accent that always reminds you he is totally miscast. He sounds like he just learned English a few months ago after speaking a Nordic language his whole life and it took me out of the film every time he spoke.

Take a look at the attached picture, you can tell the sheriff is shooting blanks, there are no bullets in the cylinder of the gun!  I would give it zero stars if I could, but there is no option for that, so I will give it an F- rating.  Don't waste your time!",1448928000,3,478,3.9479166666666665

A huge part of movie is actors in scenes that aren't relevant to the plot.
I play poker and the whole poker game makes no sense.
IT IS A TOURNAMENT POKER GAME THAT IS A $1000.00 BUY IN
Why is there a  ""MARKER"" during the tournament? Does not exist in poker tournament.
No research about how poker is played and that is the main plot!!!!!",1445299200,,425,4.059523809523809

4309669,5,B004AILAFC,"From his early days as 'Nobody' Terence Hill cast a long shadow in the genre of Spaghetti Westerns. In this latest configuration, Hill mutates to a more mellowed, mature western figure of masculinity; but, just behind those blue eyes there is a sparkle of the whimsical youth measured against the wisdom of years. All bets are on Doc West as he plays out his hand adhering to the same standards he established for himself when he played opposite the monumental talents of Henry Fonda. If you like westerns with as much 'grey matter' as sound effects, blood and guts, you'll be entertained by Doc West... or Triggerman, they obviously released the film under two titles.",1391731200,,669,4.826086956521739

4309681,4,B004AILAFC,This film brings back the western values of what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong.  The heroes show true integrity.  Protecting the women and seeing the good in people takes courage even when the good does something bad and the women cheat at cards.  Hoorah for this movie.  I can't wait to watch the first film named Doc West.  I  hope the film has the same actors and actresses.  Thanks for the way of the west!,1370736000,3,425,4.2375

4309686,3,B004AILAFC,"Ponderously slow, and too low-key for its own good, ""Triggerman"" is a not as much fun as it could have been. The acting is uneven and the story too predictable. But flawed as it is, it has enough odd charm that it is hard to dislike.",1363996800,,233,4.086956521739131

This was one of the worst westerns that I have ever seen.  Script was poor, acting was worse.  The only reason that I watched the entire movie is because I purchased it.
