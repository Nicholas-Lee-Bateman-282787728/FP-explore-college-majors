4330160,5,B004CYF80C,This dvd was shipped quickly. The kids loved it. This dvd is a good teaching tool. The price was reasonable.,1360454400,,108,4.45
4330161,4,B004CYF80C,I very good video for children's church or young children. Interesting and funny while still teaching valuable lessons. I wish they had more videos.,1356566400,,148,5.208333333333333
8423932,5,B004CYF80C,"Absolutely outstanding video with a message that no other animated Christian series deals with. When was the last time you watched an animated Christian series, that was 'cook"", relevant, funny, and where the kids are given an opportunity to accept Jesus as their personal Lord & Savior? My kids (14 year old twins - boy & girl), god-children (6 year old girl twins), as well as my  year old nephew LOVED DEX!!!!! Great job Horace...can't wait for the next episode.",1494374400,,465,4.8125
8423933,2,B004CYF80C,Great story. Very Poor production quality. Not great visually. The sound is not good at all.,1441324800,,92,4.8125
8423934,3,B004CYF80C,"Not a good video series.  Used in Sunday school and was not impressed with the direction the video was going or the poor graphics.  The message was muddied and very general.  Will not use in the future, but was worth a try.  End result was that it did not give the 30 kids I have in children's church the intended message, nor did it keep their attention longer than 3 minutes.",1423785600,,377,4.267605633802817

8423940,5,B004CYF80C,"This was a powerful episode of Dex Davis... he came home to find his parents actually studying their bibles together! Come on, that is awesome. Not a fan of the way the audio was recorded, but it is still a great series.",1382400000,,220,4.261904761904762
