3677629,1,B001L2ZSHQ,"For a Shaw Brothers production, this is one highly disappointing output. It could have been sooooo much better had a few things been done that are typical in a SB production. Van Cleef is the reason it got viewed but neither he nor his martial arts compadre could save the poverty stricken plot and poor martial arts action. Note this was the steamed version; I assume the dvd is the same.",1436400000,,389,4.492957746478873

3677631,4,B001L2ZSHQ,"Last night's bargain rack movie was ""Blood Money"" starring Lee Van Cleef, one of my favorite ""heavies"" in the western movie genre. Well, this one was billed as a ""Spaghetti Western"" and it has to be one of the stranger western movies I've ever viewed. I still haven't decided if it was a serious movie or a comedy. Well, if it was serious, the writer/director must have secretly tried to generate a few gut-level laughs, and succeeded. It was a highly convoluted plot involving a gun fighter, Van Cleef, and a Chinese Kung Fu martial arts expert, Lo Lieh, who teamed up to find a hidden treasure with the directions inscribed in tiny Chinese tattoos on about a half-dozen women's hind quarters. They could only be understood by someone who read Chinese (Lo Lieh) and only with a powerful hand lens while the woman was bared. Now, is this a strange plot, or what?

In any case, he story has the gunfighter and the Kung Fu expert going around finding and examining the women in order to solve the problem of the location of a missing fortune, and, of course, it's not an easy task. Van Cleef takes care of the gun fighting, as expected, but Lo Lieh dispatches far more tough guys with his Kung Fu antics. Strange movie! Half wild-west shoot-em-up and half martial arts. In any case, they finally examine enough female buttocks to solve the mystery and they end up back in China.

Well, I just don't know what to make of all of this. It was an enjoyable movie, if somewhat weird. There was a lot of action. It was funny in places. The acting was strictly B-movie level, but I think that was intended. The film was not the best. It had a few hard-to-explain gaps where some of the film might have been cut out. Altogether, I have mixed feelings, but I enjoyed viewing it.

3677632,4,B001L2ZSHQ,"Here's an example where Euro and American filmmakers were blending successful box office genres to make the ultimate money maker.  This joint Italian/Hong Kong co-production merged the newly arrived Kung Fu chop-socky action after the success of Run Run Shaw's 'FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH'-1971 with the failing Spaghetti Western genre by including 'FINGERS' star Lo Lieh teamed with EuroWestern star Lee Van Cleef and produced 'BLOOD MONEY' aka 'THE STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER' aka 'LA, DOVE NON BATTE IL SOLE' or in this print from VideoAsia 'LA BRUTE, LE COLT ET LE KARATE'-1973.  The film is an enjoyable romp with a complicated storyline involving a fortune of a deceased Chinese businessman who tattooed the clues of his treasure on the butts of his four mistresses.  Van Cleef and Lieh are brought together by chance where they must team up to return the treasure back to China.  In between gun battles and martial arts sequences, the women are represented by beauties Erica Blanc, Patty Shepard, Femi Bemussi and Karen Yeh and provide a nice sidelite to the hokum.  The film is directed by genre auteur Antonio Margheriti who's first Spaghetti, 'VENGEANCE' aka 'INVOCA DIO...E MUORI'-1968 is a minor masterpiece of the genre.  Actually, you can tell where he turns the film over to Shaw's action crew but the photography by Alejandro Ulloa fills the screen with beautiful images and makes it look more expensive then it probably was.  The music score by Carlo Savina is not one of his best but keeps the film moving with rapid fire.  VideoAsia culled this beautiful 2.35 transfer from a French print so the quibbling of the films running time included in one of the reviews contained within is ridiculous, it certainly beats the horrible pan and scan VHS transfer that Columbia Pictures released many years back and was most certainly edited. Margheriti would go on to direct Lee Van Cleef in 'TAKE A HARD RIDE'-1974 which blended the Blacksploitation genre with the Western and culminated in the American made 'EL CONDOR'-1970 also with Van Cleef.  All in all, a welcome purchase for all fans of early Kung Fu and Euro Western films and great for a hot, Saturday afternoon.",1307404800,4,2178,4.945205479452055
3677633,1,B001L2ZSHQ,"The above mentioned running time of 107 minutes (which would be the correct length for the US version, according to IMDB) ist NOT correct! It runs only 95 minutes and 42 seconds.
I dumped it. I do not watch cut films.",1299801600,4,217,4.317073170731708
3677634,5,B001L2ZSHQ,"Being a fan of both Lee Van Cleef and Red Sun I was quite surprised when I found out a movie such as this existed. I'm not sure why they decided to call it Blood Money though. There's no money and hardly any blood (but plenty of action). It's alternate title ""The Stranger and the Gunfighter"" would've been more adequate. Still, this movie is pretty darn good (and fun) if you like to mix things up a bit.

The DVD itself has no special features or subtitles. The language is in English though. Amazon states that it's in Italian. The cover includes a nice dust jacket as well. Great film at a great price!!!",1288483200,11,608,4.333333333333333
3677635,4,B001L2ZSHQ,"This movie suprised me.  It was really good.  Lee Van Cleef is great in this movie(as he is in everything he's done).  The video and sound quality are pretty good, not great but better than average. A must see for any western fan.",1282521600,,230,4.3023255813953485
3677636,5,B001L2ZSHQ,"I first saw this when I was about 12 at a double feature in our local cinema. I hadn't seen anything like it. Mixing the Kung Fu and Western genres must have started with this movie. The story line is still one of the most original for a western. The director has a brilliant sense of humour as well, using not only one-liners and humorous scenarios, but camera and editing techniques that spice up the story telling.
My favourite character, outside of our heroes, is the religious zealot ""Yangtze Hobbit"" (sic). Dressed all in black with a long leather duster, gloves, and wide brimmed hat, Yangtze is just as quick to use a gun as quote passages from the bible. He has cool bad guy written all over him.
I would rate this film in my top 5 Spaghetti Westerns, alongside all the Sergio Leone titles. It's primarily a comedy but it's all solid Italian/Spanish Western with all the dirt and grit that makes a Spaghetti Western what it is. I was thrilled when I discovered it had been released on DVD.
For those, like myself, who already own a VHS copy you will notice one scene is missing. There is no ""basement distillery"" fight. The original scene appears poorly shot in the first place anyway so is no great loss. When you watch the DVD version, and I hope you purchase this gem, you'll see that the ""distillery"" fight is clearly tacked on. As the titles on the DVD are in Italian and are English on the VHS I take it the tacked on fight has something to do with the American and UK markets at the time. The price for this sharp quality widescreen DVD is also really affordable.",1258156800,11,1579,4.429553264604811
3677637,3,B001L2ZSHQ,"Blood Money or also known as ""Stranger And The Gunfighter"", 1974, starring steely-eyed western legend, Lee Van Cleef, and Shaw Brothers star, Lo Lieh. This film is a Shaw Brothers production, and this film is not what you would expect it to be with these two mega stars, with the concept and idea of splicing a martial arts and western film together. The plot is a crazy ride of women chasing, each woman is a mistress of a dead master and carry a puzzle of a map tatooed on their beautiful behinds as Van Cleef and Lieh try to fit the pieces together to solve the mystery of the lost treasure. This movie concentrates more on the plot and seems to be lacking in the action department, - gunplay and martial arts - that is needed in an Italian western like this, although this film does have an extraordinary classic moment making the film worthwhile, for Lee Van Cleef collectors ""Blood Money"" is a good additive. The DVD I've viewed is the RED SUN version, excellent transfer, Videoasia has never been reliable for picture quality. The ""Fighting Fist Of Shanghai Joe"" leans more on the right concept of a western/martial arts film, or ""Once Upon A Time In China And America"" with Jet Li.",1242086400,7,1189,4.5607476635514015
3677638,5,B001L2ZSHQ,"Cool flick. Interesting fusion of martial arts and western genres. There are some great karate sequences combined with wild gunfighting that make for a solid classic.

I've seen it described as a comedy, and it didn't seem to me that Lee Van Cleef pulled that off very well.  But he does do tough guys well, and his character is definitely a tough guy.  And Lo Lieh as the hero?  Good move since he's almost always the heavy.  The story line was actually quite innovative, at least to me.

8317012,4,B001L2ZSHQ,"Pretty good movie although a bit corny. I never knew Lee Van Cleef and Lo Lieh made a movie together. I never heard of this movie before and I searched on Google, which said it was a Spaghetti Western filmed on location in both Hong Kong and Spain. It has some corny music and characters in it, but the stars, Lee Van Cleef and Lo Lieh were excellent. It did not have much Kung Fu action in it and what was shown wasn't the greatest so if you're watching it for martial arts you will be disappointed. If you're a fan of Spaghetti Westerns (which a lot of them were pretty corny), you will enjoy this movie. But truth be told, no Spaghetti Westerns can compare with the ones starring Clint Eastwood. If Clint was in this movie than it surely would have been a 5 star movie.",1477353600,,772,4.222972972972973
8317013,4,B001L2ZSHQ,"A strangely not terrible 1974 kung fu spaghetti western from the Shaw brothers that's also known as ""The Stranger and the Gunfighter"". Light in tone, our hero makes his way across the west to track down where his uncle hid the fortune he made in the US before his family back home is held responsible for the uncle absconding with the investment money. Our hero finds out the map is tattooed across several women's butts (in several bizarre scenes involving nudity and a loupe) and a safe cracker in Lee Van Cleef who promises to help. The film comes across a bit uneven, sloppy, but charming. The real oddity is the conflict generated by the mobile home preacher out to beat our heroes, this is the one artificial element and it ultimately drives it to a lesser conclusion where the fightin' and shootin' come together, but while the destination isn't the best, at least the journey is interesting.",1470787200,,899,4.69620253164557
