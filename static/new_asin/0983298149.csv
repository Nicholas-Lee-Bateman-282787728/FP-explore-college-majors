7795165,5,0983298149,"Have been looking for an instructional on Odissi for a long time and this is a great DVD!! Provides 36 foot positions, 59 hand mudras, and very clearly explained little sequences of chauka and tribunghi steps. Very well done, very clear, great work and there is enough movements to practice for quite a long time until you master them!",1422921600,,335,4.694915254237288
7795166,3,0983298149,"A little disappointed as a lot of the footwork is hard to follow as the camera moves about too much.
The really good dance tutoriols I have used also ensure that the movements are shown both from the front and with the teacher facing away so that you can really follow the steps with them.
It also would be helpful to have the names of each movement mudra and choka written in text on screen as they are shown to assist in the learning of the names which are difficult to get a hold on as an English speaker.",1381708800,5,508,4.141414141414141
7795167,5,0983298149,This is very well created.  The dance steps are broken down and repeated in a simple manner that anyone can follow.,1361318400,3,115,4.476190476190476
