7414368,4,B014L2YKMG,So far I've only watched the first three seasons and so far so good. I have not had any problems with the quality of the DVDs. I was also happy with getting the full collection at a very reasonable price. I would have given a five star rating but as I stated before I haven't watched all of the discs at this time.

7414375,5,B014L2YKMG,"One thing I admired about this show was that Brett kept it close to her southern heritage but held a lot more tolerance of other cultures and sensibilities. The friendship between Grace and Nadine seemed genuine with its ups and downs. The only character that was too saccharin was Libby but the episode where her navy pen pal comes to visit is hysterical.
Its tough to say what any of us would do when given all that money and power at one time. I might have been a diva myself. Its just bittersweet that the show ended because of sour note and from reports Ms. Butler's behavior off camera.
Bottom line: Great show and the price is great too! Many hours of laughs.",1518825600,,666,4.4227642276422765

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews about bad discs so I binge watched it before my 30 day return window closed.  I played them on my PS3 and they all played flawlessly.

The one where Alan Autry was added to the cast!! Alan Autry was only in Season 3 disk 1 and disk 2 so needless to say, I feel cheated on this purchase. I am NOT happy with the Amazon seller '' VEI.'' I paid $29.99 for The Complete Collection of Grace Under Fire but,  Season 3 disk #1 does NOT work at all.  Buyer beware.... Do NOT purchase this set from '' VEI.''",1491609600,5,519,3.980769230769231

7414419,4,B014L2YKMG,"When first released in 2015, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grace-Under-Fire-Complete-Collection/dp/B014L2YKMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grace Under Fire Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;totalled 14 discs and consisted of five individual season sets (3/3/3/3/2 discs) in a slipcase and not available individually. In 2016, VEI&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/reissued-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B01M6W43UZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">reissued The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;in more basic packaging. This time the disc count was reduced to only 10. The previous 14 was a bit of a stretch, compression-wise, but 10 pushes it well over the edge, averaging around 260min of content per disc. The latter release can also be had as individual seasons.

Though it started off mighty powerfully, due to star Brett Butler's well-documented appalling behaviour, the show had all but imploded by season 4. Consequently, the first three are the only ones really worth owning. Having said that though, the complete set price is usually around the same as the price of buying those three individually. The choice is yours!",1487894400,5,1197,7.142857142857143

7414430,5,B014L2YKMG,"I've been looking for this series since I watched it as a child with my mother in the 90's. It is one of the most real and innovative series I've ever seen, on par with Roseanne, Cybill, and Home Improvement. The box set itself is very well done. The box is sturdy and holds the DVD cases well. The DVD cases are high-quality hard plastic, and each disc has its own secure holder. As for the DVDs themselves, there are no glitches whatsoever, no skips or freezing either. The menus are clean, easy to navigate and very user-friendly. It's clear that a lot of time, dedication and dare I say love was put into this collection. This is one series that any fan of Brett Butler and/or classic 90's sitcoms about the trials and tribulations of working-class families will be proud to have on their DVD shelf!",1480636800,22,803,4.469387755102041

Of the 14 discs, there are 7 with visible surface defects and do not play.
These are not scratched, but bubble rings created in the manufacturing process.  I don't see how the video could be copied on a defective disc.  There seems to be no quality control as this is one of the easiest problems to see during the manufacturing process.",1454630400,19,390,4.464788732394366

7414462,5,B014L2YKMG,"I've been waiting for this ever since they started making box sets. Still can't believe that it took so long,  but it made my Christmas when I found out it was finally coming out. Brett Butler was one of the best female comedians around in the 90s,  and it broke my heart when she self-destructed and the show was abruptly canceled in the 5th season.  Great supporting cast,  intelligent dialogue - what's not to love?",1453248000,8,418,4.533333333333333
