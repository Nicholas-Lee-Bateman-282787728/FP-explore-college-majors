8725087,5,B00IEK12TQ,"As the others 2X2 Conditioning, this one also includes 2 minutes of cardio and 2 of strength. For the cardio portion, I moved between levels 2 and 3 and I found the stability ball adds an extra intensity. I found the strength portion more difficult as I am still not very used to working out with the ball, but if you are intermediate-advanced with a strong core, you would probably have no troubles. The bonus adds an excellent core workout which nicely works your abs, back and obliques. I was particulary impressed by some new original moves and I will certainly stick with this one.",1392681600,,586,4.59047619047619
