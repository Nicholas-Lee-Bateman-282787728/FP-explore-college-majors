8511577,4,B00778XQZ4,"Czech-made TV film has effective moments of the reprisal liquidation of Lidice, in Bohemia, one of the more notorious occupation war crimes in Europe.  It faithfully recreates the time and place; I can't address how accurately it portrays the real event.  As usual in such films this is told through the personal drama of fictionalized characters.  Perhaps its most poignant moment was the survivor's return, and his brushoff by authorities trying to officially exploit the atrocity.  The real tragedies of real persons, and the lessons they can bring to bear, have naught to do with the agendas of power.  As in Israel today.",1528329600,,626,5.038834951456311
