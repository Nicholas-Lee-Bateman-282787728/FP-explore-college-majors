6447857,5,B00KU3Y5HG,"When I watched it I thought it was really lovely the art work and characters were amazing the story it self was beautiful, sad, heart warming, and never a dull moment. It mad me cry but I Loved Every Second of Every Minute. I Hoped It Never ENDED",1411603200,2,246,4.145833333333333
6447858,5,B00KU3Y5HG,This movie is damned good. It's one of those watch it twice movies.,1411257600,,67,4.230769230769231
6447859,4,B00KU3Y5HG,"At first, this movie infuriated me. It left me behind, forced me to make assumptions I didn't want to distract myself with, the characters were hardly relatable let alone interesting, the story was way too short for the emotions it was trying to invoke, the plot twists felt cheap, nothing made sense, and I. Was. Ticked.
But then I stepped back. Took it at face value. And when I looked at it from a new perspective, Hal just might be one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time.
This is a movie that's almost impossible to talk about if the other party hasn't seen it. It's bizarre and interesting to discuss, but there's just too much at stake that can be spoiled if you haven't seen it yet. Go see this movie. Just once - don't buy it like I did. Decide if it affects you enough that you'd want to have it. Regardless, I'm still glad I have it in my collection.
Hal was completely unexpected. I still have my nitpicks, sure, but this movie was incredibly thought-provoking. It wasn't the kind that drove me to tears, but it gave me something to ponder that no other movie has asked of me in a recent memory.
Honestly, I was really disappointed to find out Todd Haberkorn voiced a side character, and he was the main reason I bought this in the first place, thinking he was Hal. Don't make that mix-up like I did, but just know that all of the parts are voiced well, and you won't be disappointed by Todd's performance - as per usual.
If I can give anyone who's never seen this and willing to give it a try some advice, I'd tell you this: Hal doesnt give you the luxury of watching and being led along on a ride. It makes you think and wonder and work for the story. Also, this movie works best when you're alone and focused. It'll probably go over your head if you're in a chatty group, not looking for every last detail. And even though lots of people don't, I always recommend sitting through the credits of every movie you watch. The ending song always helps wrap things up and give you peace, and there's usually a scene at the end most people completely miss since once they see the credits roll, they hit stop.
Good for the collection, but I can't see myself watching this again and again as it's the kind of story that has little replay value. As long as it gets you the first time around, I think it's worth it.",1411171200,9,2326,4.288636363636364
6447860,5,B00KU3Y5HG,Hal was a surprise hit.  It's been a long time an animation film has brought out strong emotions. The film draws you in at the beginning and you start having strong feeling for the main characters.  Be prepared to cry.  None animation people will enjoy this movie.,1410566400,,264,4.574468085106383
6447861,5,B00KU3Y5HG,"extremely very....veeeerrrrrry Good movie. I saw the trailer of this movie once and read reviews in dozen of sources, majors of reviewers claimed it was good... and one of the review said something about watch on bul-ray which is way better than dvd...VERY TRUE! It was really good movie with twisted ending something none of us would expected it. Amazing movie... It has a beautiful graphics... very well expressions and dynamic within characters. Yet I have to admit something.. there are some scenes where it doesn't make sense or left us with unanswered questions but eventually it will answered vaguely later in end. Still Good movie!",1410393600,,639,5.037735849056604
6447862,5,B00KU3Y5HG,"I loved this movie. I ordered it going by the 7 minute clip Funimation uploaded to youtube and thought it would be great. It was. It's a story about a bond so strong, and a journey of moving on. It's very short at only about 60 minutes which did surprise me, but that doesn't take away from how good this movie is. It left me shocked. It comes with several alternate covers as well, which is a plus! Any anime fan would love it, just know there is not much action as this is a love story. But there definitely IS action in this movie.",1409875200,12,534,4.095238095238095
6447863,4,B00KU3Y5HG,"Movies like these prove just how powerful the medium of anime is.  I think anime gets written off far too much as a ""kid's thing"" by Americans.  Like many people I grew up in the 90s during a time in which anime just began its second surge into the states which has since led to the current flow of today.  As a fan I can say without embarrassment that anime has provided me with more goosebumps and heartfelt emotions than the majority of American television and movies that I've seen.  ""Hal The Movie"" certainly fits into the category of a good movie, not just as an animated piece.  It is nothing short of amazing, especially given the fact that movie is only 60 minutes in length.  The story revolves around robots, lost love, and finding purpose in life after all is lost.  I could give you a detailed description of the plot but it was far more powerful for me to simply watch the movie without the story (if you truly wanna know what the movie's about I know it's pretty easy to just look it up).  It's tough to imagine another movie telling the same kind of story so well in the span of such a short time.

The first thing that will strike you about the movie is the visuals of the movie.  I kid you not, I cannot express how badly you need to view this film on blu-ray is.  DVD would not do it justice, and for those of you without blu-ray players I suggest that this movie be viewed on a friend's player or a projector.  From the opening frame it's pretty easy to see how Wit Studio could have done this project (it's the same studio that produced ""Attack on Titan"" the anime series).  If that's not enough wait until you hit some of the outside shots and you'll be hit by a dazzling set of colors and beauty.  Simply put, the movie is a visual wonderland.

The audio for the movie becomes a bit trickier to review since it boils down to person preference.  For me, I rather enjoyed the English cast that did the movie even though I originally watched the film in Japanese.  Regardless of your preference each cast does an absolutely amazing job.  A personal touch I enjoyed was the rather somber and almost ambient background music.  It's great in that it doesn't overpower the scene going on, especially since many of the scenes in this movie occur without any dialogue.  Of course, the blu-ray is the clear choice for audio as well since it's augmented for a closer theater experience.

Overall, I have to say that this movie hits hard, right in that stupid spot that causes giant man tears to well up (think boobies, explosions, and swords you girl man).  I really enjoyed this movie and based on what I've written it may seem a little confusing as to why I would gave the rating I did.  The main reason is that the movie does hit as hard as it does, so the replay value isn't as high.  Trust me though, this one is going into the collection.  It's a rare movie that I can suggest to people who aren't anime fans that consistently leaves the same impression on others as it did with me.  As a sell it's pretty easy to recommend because it comes in the dual Blu-ray/DVD combo and a pretty good price, especially as anime is concerned (still my most expensive hobby to date).  If you're looking for a movie that has heart you'll definitely want to check this out.",1406073600,49,3275,4.361386138613861

6447885,5,B00KU3Y5HG,Very thought provoking film. The ending gets real bizarre. I would definitely buy this on DVD cause it's worth a rewatch.,1499644800,,121,4.809523809523809
6447886,4,B00KU3Y5HG,This was a little odd but beautifully animated. Has a great twist ending.,1496448000,,73,4.6923076923076925

6447888,4,B00KU3Y5HG,"the second time to see if you can find indications of the coming Plot Twist (They're there).  However, the longer it has been since watching it, the more plot holes will show up; frankly, it is uncomfortably unclear how this was ever supposed to have worked.

Basically, in order to help the survivor of a pair of lovers, one of whom died in a plane crash, a robot is asked to adopt the appearance of the deceased lover, to comfort the survivor, and to piece together the secrets that remain.  Then the major Plot Twist hits, and everything is in flux.  Now, the Plot Twist is beautifully done, with plenty of subtle clues you can see upon rewatching; the problems come in when you start to think about it....  No matter how you look at it, a pretty serious crime has been committed and apparently gone unpunished, and beyond that it is more than a bit unclear how this treatment could ever have worked without the outside interference.  Additional length devoted to clearing this up at the end might have helped.",1490054400,,1013,4.569060773480663

6447891,5,B00KU3Y5HG,This was an incredible cute but sad story. It shows the aspect of love not just the one of a boyfriend and girlfriend but that of those around you from your friends to the neighborhood old ladies. I recommend who has an hour available to check this movie out especially if you like those bittersweet stories.,1476576000,,308,4.517857142857143

6447914,3,B00KU3Y5HG,I generally enjoy this creator however in comparison to some of the other titles this one was really short for the price and the story line under developed.  It was a beautiful idea that was not fully realized.  This would have been better in a collection of short films vs. being marketed as a full feature film.,1475452800,,313,4.473684210526316

6447916,4,B00KU3Y5HG,The description does a good job breaking the story down in a non spoiler way. It's so sweet and tugs on the heart just a little. Not a feelz-trip.

6447919,5,B00KU3Y5HG,"I really liked it. I'm not going to say anything about what goes on in the movie other than it'll bring in the feels multiple times =)

It's pretty enjoyable especially if you like romance or cute relationship stuff.
Really short though, sadly. Only an hour long, and kind of feels like it ends shortly.

It does come in a box like in the picture, but not the typical sleeve that comes right off, rather a box that holds one case instead of multiple cases (like a collector's item or something similar).

It also comes with 3 extra DVD case covers so you can go with the default or choose your favorite! (all the information is the same on each cover)",1470355200,,651,4.363636363636363

6447946,4,B00KU3Y5HG,This movie was very well and had a beautiful story.  There were subtle aspects to the animation that really made it unusual where the 3D images crossed over into the cartoon ones.  I loved the characters of the story.  I would recommend this for someone who would like to watch a thought provoking drama minimal violence.  I would give it a PG-13 rating since there are a few brief fighting scenes.  I am going to see what else this director did!,1457222400,,446,4.45679012345679
6447947,2,B00KU3Y5HG,"I was sure this would be good based on all the positive reviews. I was quite disappointed. The story lacked explanation for nearly everything, making it confusing and rather silly. The movie was also much too short to get involved at any length with the characters.

6447982,3,B00KU3Y5HG,"i feel like the 60 minute length forces this movie to rush the relationship between Hal and Kurumi.

6447983,5,B00KU3Y5HG,GREAT MOVIE!,1431043200,,12,5.5
6447984,5,B00KU3Y5HG,"I purchased Hal: the Movie because I thought it would be like a Makoto Shinkai film: a short, bittersweet romance with elements of sci-fi. Thats actually not a half-bad description, but it turned out to be so much more.

The basic plot is that a grief-stricken girl has become reclusive after the death of her boyfriend, Hal. Her grandfather finds a remedy in creating a robotic version of Hal to help her remember what it is to live.

Sound a bit iffy? I agree. If that were the whole scope of what this movie was about, it would probably be nothing more than a 3/5 star film if it were executed correctly. However, this film dives deeper than that by far, and I can almost guarantee that it won't be what you were expecting. By the end of this film, youll realize what an inadequate summary of the tale exists for those who have not seen it, and be as powerless as I am to enlighten them. Its impossible to convey the beauty and depth of this film without spoilers, which is no small wonder considering its only about an hour long.

This movie comes from an animator of Colorful: the Motion Picture, which is no surprise to me. Not only does it come close to living up to that movie, but the animation kept vaguely reminding me of Colorful, which is what drove me to look up the director in the first place. However, the animation is not so subdued as Colorful's, which required a more dreary and real look. Hal is vibrantly animated, while still almost devoid of the impossible, unnatural sheen of Makoto Shinkais films. Its a perfect balance between beautiful and realistic; the way the characters move and everything about it is wholly smooth and natural, but its simply gorgeous, especially in Blu-ray format. It seems to be only available in the U.S. as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, or otherwise I might have just purchased a DVD version to save a few bucks. I watched it first in DVD format, but when I tried out the Blu-ray later I was astounded. Every line is infinitely clearer, and everything glows in the animated sunlight.

The English dub is definitely good enough if you don't enjoy reading subtitles, while the Japanese is just superior enough to make it worth it if you do. I enjoyed both versions. The music is really beautiful.

All in all, this is a 5/5 star film. I don't see many ways that it could have been improved.",1430870400,,2338,4.504716981132075

I will never get that hour of my life back.

I will give the movie credit for the animation, because it was good. It really was.

But holy crap was this movie BAD! I liked the plot idea of it...then suddenly it's the girl whose a robot and the guy, Hal, THINKS he's a robot because his girlfriend got killed? And that's shoved in the last like, 5 minutes of the film!

I was also annoyed by the lack of subtitles for the puzzle cube. Figuring out what each side said was supposed to be important, but us english viewer have NO WAY of knowing what it says!",1428278400,3,611,4.333333333333333

6447993,3,B00KU3Y5HG,"The movie started out great and built up a really nice mood.  The art and pace of the film were all done quite well as well as character development (although not much to begin with)

There were a few things I disliked about the film which would mainly be the plot twist which really felt like it was a bit unpolished and not very well done.  I was not expecting that at all and I felt like the movie ended in the wrong direction and didn't really have any closure (or if any very weak)  Majority of the side characters are very forgettable but I understand that the movie is mainly focused on Hal and his relationship with Kurumi but for me personally it'll keep coming back to the main problem which was the plot twist and ending.

I would say it's a movie to watch once but it's not really a movie that you'll remember due to the ending and plot twist.  It's hard to recommend this movie because there really isn't too much romance to say it's a love story if that's what you're hoping to look for.",1426464000,,1001,4.242105263157895

6448008,5,B00KU3Y5HG,Such a great movie with an awesome twist.,1423785600,,41,4.25
6448009,1,B00KU3Y5HG,I agree with several other reviewers.  Artwork was beautiful so was the music. However the story felt rushed and it should have kept to the original plot instead twisting it toward the end of the movie.  I hated it and by the end of it it left so many questions unanswered.  I wish I would have never bought this video because it was a complete waste of money.,1423526400,2,360,4.264705882352941

6448025,4,B00KU3Y5HG,"I love the style,  Io Sakisaka did a wonderful work. And the animators really bring her style out, not every shoujo style works on anime. The story is original and keeps you very entertained on every second on the film, it is an emotional film. Really recommend it.",1419984000,,265,4.520833333333333
6448026,5,B00KU3Y5HG,Have to admit that the twist in this movie is quite a surprise. Very well done..,1419811200,,80,4.0625
6448027,4,B00KU3Y5HG,I can't decide if I love it or not. Hal is very different for me when it comes to anime. I felt like they relationship could have gone rather and maybe more about certain things explained. But all-in-all it was very fantastic and cute. I loved the world concepts and it was a great story. I would love to say more but I'm afraid I'd spoil the movie :),1419552000,,351,4.101449275362318
6448028,5,B00KU3Y5HG,this young girl saves the robot's life while she drifts away on the river currents out of his reach  sad but wonderful all the same!,1418428800,,132,4.28
6448029,4,B00KU3Y5HG,Very bittersweet and visually well done movie. I'll leave it at that as to say to much is to muddy what the film tries to do.,1416441600,,125,3.8461538461538463
6448030,3,B00KU3Y5HG,nicely animated but the story was a bit strange and lacked any real resolve,1416009600,,75,4.428571428571429

6448032,4,B00KU3Y5HG,Suffice it to say Its not what you think. This is a wonderful movie that subtly exposes our delicate human psyche. Directors: Ryoutarou Makihara and Mike McFarland have told a wonderful story and created a world full of detail and visual delight. Im sure Ill watch this one several more times.,1415836800,,293,4.764705882352941

6448047,5,B00KU3Y5HG,Beautiful movie in Blu-ray. Story is a bit weird but I think it was really cute and heartbreaking. I totally recommend this movie to anime fans.,1413158400,,144,4.576923076923077

The good points: The movie is beautiful.  The animation, the music, the voice acting (though I can't speak for the English version, as I watched it in Japanese), and the story.  You're probably wondering why I gave it a 3 if all of these things are great, and that's where I get to...
The bad points:  Though the story is a great idea, they did not tell it in a way that makes logical sense.  I don't want to give anything away, so I will only say that if you're looking for something with sound story-telling, steer clear.  My other complaint is the length.  It was far too short at 60 minutes, making the person watching it feel like there is something missing.  The plot seems to jump from point D to point X near the end, and it seemed to me that it was either rushed or too many parts were cut out of the original.  I love anime, so I hate to give such a beautiful movie a low score, but you should know before you purchase that it does not seem like a complete piece.",1411948800,18,996,4.151041666666667
8661626,5,B00KU3Y5HG,I enjoyed this more than I thought. With the mixed reviews it seemed to get I took a chance and it paid off. The twist at the end is well done. After rewatching it the twist seems even better. I only wish it was longer.,1531353600,,219,3.888888888888889
8661627,2,B00KU3Y5HG,"Like other reviewers  I feel inclined to mention the great animation, however it alone struggles to redeem this mess of a plot. It's short run time makes side characters very uninteresting, forgettable, and weakens the movie's  emotional core. The plot twist comes out of nowhere and makes no sense  whatsoever. Even worse the twist is revealed in the last ten minutes  of the movie! Though it's  not painful to sit through I would never recommend it.",1531267200,,451,4.881578947368421

Maybe it just wasn't my kind of anime. I didn't find it worth keeping. I'd suggest read other comments besides mine, and see what you think, if you're at all inclined to purchase this movie.",1525046400,,347,4.3538461538461535

8661635,4,B00KU3Y5HG,"A quirky and touching anime, Hal: The Movie is the story of Kurumi, a girl who was left brokenhearted after the death of her boyfriend Hal, and the new Hal, a humanoid robot duplicate of the original Hal who was created for her as an act of kindness by an eccentric scientist.  (In the movie, it appears to be more or less 'now' timewise, but robotics are much further advanced)  The film becomes a charming and involved romance, in which the main question is whether or not the two main protagonists will get together.  But there are some other questions in there too that don't come up until the movie is nearing its end.  Hal: The Movie has some twists, but they're not the twists one might expect going in.

The animation is beautiful, and the use of color, with lots of pastels mixed in with the brighter shades, gives it a bit of a unique look.  It's a short movie - only sixty minutes - but it gets the job done. Thematically, this should appeal to fans of anime such as From Up On Poppy Hill, The Garden Of Words and Ocean Waves.  Four-and-a-half stars.",1502236800,,1061,4.38265306122449
