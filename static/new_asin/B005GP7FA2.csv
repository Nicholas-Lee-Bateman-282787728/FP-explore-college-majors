4692651,5,B005GP7FA2,"The show was fresh, new and displayed classic components of Rickey's Comedy genre. I laughed through the whole show. Ricky did some of his classic church comedy and incorporated the band with the act. It was hilarious and the funniest comedy show I've saw all year.",1320710400,,265,4.782608695652174
4692652,2,B005GP7FA2,"At one point in the show Ricky Smiley asks people on the front row why they aren't laughing. The answer is simple. this is not funny. I waited and waited for laughs. None came. Maybe I've seen too many comedy shows, but this one does not move me at all. Lil Darryl is more tragic than humorous. The 'Church Lady' brought a few chuckles the first few times he brought her out. The bit about the bass player needed to be fleshed out. But, the music he used had no prominent bass playing in it, so it didn't work. Sorry Ricky Smiley, but you need to put some thought behind your act. Build on something instead of giving us just a premise. I'm still waiting to laugh.",1320624000,,664,4.2362204724409445
4692653,5,B005GP7FA2,I love Rickey Smiley...he is just the craziest comedian ever! He keeps me in tears...I laugh so hard it's a shame. I saw this on BET but can't wait for my DVD to arrive so I can laugh until my stomach hurts.,1320019200,4,207,3.9523809523809526
4692654,5,B005GP7FA2,"I have to give a 'shout out' to BET Networks for airing this concert for if it weren't for them I wouldn't know this concert existed.  I could not stop laughing throughout and had to go back and watch it a second time because I missed segments from crying I did.  Nothing tops him talking about church experiences and the best for me was talking about the ""Old Man bass player in Master P's band"".

This is a concert that all can enjoy ... and I am glad to have added it to my collection.  Rickey Smiley is so underrated .... he's hilarious!",1320019200,4,541,4.223300970873787

4692773,2,B005GP7FA2,"I saw a snippet of this and figured it would be something that would be hilarious to my boyfriend. He finds Lavell Crawford and Kevin Hart to be hilarious. I was pretty sure we could chuckle at this together but man oh man was I wrong. These jokes are not funny. They are very repetitive. Black jokes, white jokes, old people jokes, and church jokes. That's all that this Smiley has to offer. My boyfriend (who laughs at EVERYTHING) had the straightest face I'd ever seen while we watched this DVD. We are in our young twenties so maybe this simply is not appealing to our generation. I have a strange sense of humor (I like dark comedies and edgy goofy films) but I was pretty sure this would at least make me laugh a little. Not at all! Skip this DVD. Save your money.

His comedy is always real life events that he experience so it makes more funny than made up events.  Also, his attitude is a very possitive so for me is needed in the world today is positivity.",1374105600,,361,4.538461538461538

Not expected for a comedy routine and we were concerned that it was going to be a performance, but it was all part of the act.  only downside.....Rickey's pants were a little too short and not fashionable.  Total high waters!!",1325721600,,389,4.347222222222222

4692889,2,B005GP7FA2,"I like Rickey Smiley, so my expectations for ""Open Casket Sharp"" were high especially after watching the clips on the commercial.  Turns out the only funny parts of the entire show were on the commercial clips and Steve Harvey who introduced Rickey at the beginning of the show. Very disappointing.",1324166400,,298,4.96

4692903,1,B005GP7FA2,This standup was about as funny as stabbing. When you have to Ask the audience if it's funny then it's bad. I gave the DVD to my nephew to use as a frisbee. I like his syndicated morning show but this was bad.,1323907200,2,209,3.883720930232558

4692906,4,B005GP7FA2,"This DVD was very funny, and brought back some real fun memories.  Rickey Smiley is very descriptive which really gets you into it and you visualize what he's talking about.  I love it.",1323734400,,185,4.575757575757576
4692907,1,B005GP7FA2,"No long drawn out review with a whole lot of fancy words no one knows the meaning of. My review will have errors and typos but you'll understand my point.  In short, the DVD was horrible.  Great comedians tell Extremely Funny stories and occassionally throw in a a few good jokes and Rickey did neither.  The jokes and stories were terrible. The bits were too long as far as timing.  Songs that should have been 30 seconds snippets were full 3 min songs (White & Black Band comparison).  Oh I'm in pain... writing this is bringing back memories.  Rickey has been funny in movies.  I love him in Friday and on his radio show.  But I have to tell Rickey the jokes were not funny on this DVD.  The music sucked, and take your own advice and shorten all your bits they were painful to watch.  I over heard a girl say ""I wish I had Bought it from the ""Boot leg man"" so I could've told him it was broke to get a different movie.  It was like watching paint dry UUUUgh.""  When I heard that I almost choked with laughter.  Rickey We love you Bro, but as the folks at ESPN would say, ""Come on Man.""  I hope we see you on stage again but please get better at this Filmed Comedy Show thing, or better yet get better people around you to tell you what's funny and what's not.  This does not represent the best of Rickey Smiley.",1323648000,4,1315,4.183266932270916
4692908,1,B005GP7FA2,"I like Rickey Smiley. I think he is very funny, but this DVD was a big let down.

4692911,2,B005GP7FA2,"To be honest not very funny at all. Don't get me wrong I recently went to his live show which was hilarious, but he also had other acts. This DVD only has Rickey Smiley doing about an hour of standup, in my opinion this is nowhere near his best work.",1321488000,,250,4.02
4692912,4,B005GP7FA2,Rickey Smiley cracks me up. He kept me laughing for the whole time it was on. I would have liked it to be longer than the 75 mins.,1321142400,,130,3.6785714285714284
