171574,5,0870204556,"As the son of a Vietnam Veteran I find this DVD set to be very useful and in many cases found factual the histories of certain units. If you're anti-war and anti-military don't watch these films but if you're genuinely interested in military history and the history of the Vietnam War buy these. They're cheap.

Sure, it's the ""government"" perspective ... but it is what it is. If you can get past the dated style of narration, there is also a lot of information in these films which is very factual. I personally learned the timelines of some  operations my dad's division was involved in. And this is footage of the main units serving in The Nam compiled in one place for less than ten dollars. I also got to learn about a riverine Navy Unit an uncle of my mother was involved with. I would ask him about it myself but unfortunately he's dead due to Agent Orange.

The people that put this DVD set together are really doing the public a service. I have some of these films already but I had to go to the National Archives and copy them myself. I've gathered up films like these and done my own interviews to help tell the story about my dad's unit, but there were some films on this set I didn't find or even know about and now I'll go look for them on my next visit to the National Archives.

If you want the ""truth"" about the Vietnam War talk to the Veterans who were there. That's as close as you'll get. People who weren't there or don't have family members or friends who were there and to tell them what it was like aren't going to know what really happened there. Maybe if people start to document the histories of the Vietnam Veterans the public will have a better understanding. Unfortunately, most of these vets have mostly remained silent all these years because of the very kind of people who would simply call these films propaganda and then dismiss them and say we lost the war. Meanwhile, for those of us who are curious about the war, time is not on our side as Agent Orange, PTSD, etc. are decimating these Veterans most of whom are ""brave"" and ""honorable.""

I've been interviewing my dad and people from his unit and the story they tell is quite different than what the media, the government or some anti-war protesters in some cases reading North Vietnamese ""propaganda"" in the 60s and 70s have told us over the years. War is never good, but the WWII Veterans (who fought the 'good war'), for example, were not the only ""band of brothers."" There were ""bands of brothers"" in Korea, Vietnam and I can guarantee right now in Afghanistan and Iraq - maybe we'll hear their stories someday too.

Furthermore, if you're looking for one documentary to tell the story about an entire war in ""Indochina"" that took 10,000 days and went from the 1940s until the late 1970s then you're going to be very disappointed. A lot of the stuff presented in these films is what really happened but with all public relations the entity behind the material ... in this case the government ... is putting their spin on it though these films are in ways ways factual. So, check these ""government films"" out, they're pretty interesting, then do yourself a favor ... make friends with some Vietnam Vets, thank them for their service in The Nam (whether you agreed with the war or not) and listen to what they have to say if they'll tell you. Also, read some good books like Stanley Karnow's Vietnam book, Herr's book, ""Dispatches"", Joe Galloway and Col. Moore's two books, and a book called, ""The Rise and Fall of an American Army"" also read some of the the scores of books written by the vets themselves like ""and a hard rain fell,"" and ""Brennan's War"" and ""Ghosts of the Highlands."" I've found a few documentaries particularly interesting: Vietnam: A Television History, Inside the Vietnam War, the 10,000 Day War, etc, etc. The television series, though it's fiction, ""Tour of Duty"" is also well done.

If you look at things and study them from many perspectives you'll find the truth about the war isn't simple and the Vietnam War was very complicated. You're also going to learn that the guys who were there, for the most part, were honorable people who were drafted or joined the military and then did their jobs honorably in some of the worst circumstances or even worse than people, myself included, can imagine. Even I can't imagine what they went through ... but I know how my dad is after doing two tours there. It's in his eyes.

If you study the history of our military in Vietnam you'll also learn that they never lost a major battle and the war was lost politically not militarily. You'll also learn that the seeds of the war began in the 1940s and wasn't the fault of 19-year-old boys who people spit on and called names upon returning home from their tours of duty.

If you want the total truth, you'll never find it, it doesn't exist ... the Vietnam War is still controversial 40 years after the U.S. started draw down it's troops there. The Vietnam War is a never ending story and you'll never get to the end of it and it will still be debated years from now.

I for one, am glad these films were preserved by the government and someone thought to put them on a four DVD set that can be found online for less than 10 bucks.",1239580800,61,5235,4.483735571878279
171575,5,0870204556,"I am buying this series not because I condone war but to remind my family and myself that war is sometimes fought out of misjudgement, miscalculation, short-sighted vision, desperation  and  at other times it is dictated by the circumstances of time when the regional war, such as Vietnam conflict,  occurred. We ought to remember the U.S. military and political mentalities of the 1960 when the Vietnam War was at its height and many, many young Americans sacrificed their lives for a country they had not known until they were conscripted to fight. This was a very expensive war in terms of wasted manpower and material resources. At that time, the U.S. thought that if the Communists were not stopped  in their tracks, they would advance further into Southeast Asia and eventually the whole region would turned ""RED"" - the often touted domino theory in which if one state falls the others would soon follow in predictable manner  or so it seems....!
However, on hindsight, we all know that the Vietnam Conflict was painful, perhaps overreacted on the part of the U.S. presidents and their advisors as well as the military. This current TV series ought to teach young people that war, be it any form, any fashion, any shade, should be OUTLAWED if this planet of ours which we dwell in peace and understand each other in the spirit of brotherhood. I would recommend this TV series to all students of recent history.
I would terminate this write-up with a quote from Sun Tzu, the brilliant Chinese military strategist, who once said in his famous THE ART OF WAR  (or Sun Tzu Ping Fa):
""Know your enemy and yourself and you will be victorious in every military encounter, however, if you neither know yourself nor your enemy, you're are bound to lose in every encounter...!""
Cheers & Happy New Year 2009 to everyone here.",1230768000,7,1820,4.780254777070064
171576,4,0870204556,"Mill Creek's VIETNAM: AMERICA'S CONFLICT is one of the strangest things I have ever seen. I say that because of what it simply is: A collection of Department of Defense & US Military made propaganda films intended to sell the war in Vietnam to America's population like MacDonald's sells hamburgers. Many viewers may be downright revolted by the content of these short films, most of which are no more than 30 minutes long. Revolted not by scenes of carnage or suffering -- though rest assured there is plenty of that -- but revolted by the approach used by the narrators to describe the activities depicted. Words like ""heroism"", ""combat effectiveness"", ""decisive victory"" and ""honor & duty"" are not what most of us associate with the Vietnam War.

And yet that was sort of the deal at the time most of these were made, between 1965 and 1969 or so, before the tide of public opinion had turned against the effort. If you have ever wondered how on earth people could have been surprised that we ""lost"", here you go. If you were to believe the jingoistic, upbeat, optimistic tone of these short documentary films you'd have expected us to win. Or put it this way: If what is on these DVDs is the only information you have to consider about the Vietnam War, you'd be hard pressed to believe that we actually managed to LOSE.

That's what makes them propaganda. They are meant to convince viewers that not only was the military effort going well, but that by golly some of it might actually be kind of fun, especially scenes of flyboys celebrating with champagne back at the Bien Hoa air base after their squadron's 25th successful bombing raid. Later, they relax at an on-base officer's club while enjoying a song & dance routine by a famous celebrity couple organized by the USO program. We see films of happy Viet Cong defectors undergoing friendly looking interrogations overseen by US advisors, gallant US medics treating the sick & infirmed in native jungle villages, plenty of hearts & minds & skirmishes being won, and lots of heroic shots of American firepower giving their best to one Mr. Victor Charlie. Just with none of the introspection or second guessing popularized by such mainstream entertainments as APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, HAMBURGER HILL. THE BOYS IN COMPANY C, 84 CHARLIE MOPIC or GO TELL THE SPARTANS. It looks noble, it looks clean, and gosh darn if some of it doesn't look downright fun.

Is this for real? You have to ask yourself that, and the answer in plain doublespeak is yes. This is really the way that the war was promoted for the first few years before images of the Tet Offensive, Walter Cronkite asking ""What the hell is going on here?"", and Army colonels describing how they had to destroy villages in order to save them, it's the way the government told things before the war's more infamous events got in the way of all the nation building. Developments like the My Lai Massacre, the release of the Pentagon Papers, accidental B-52 bombings of Cambodian villages, and the backlash against Lyndon Johnson's presidency were yet to happen. And when you get down to brass tacks, the US Military more or less ""won"" every battle they fought in Vietnam, our soldiers really did serve with honor & distinction, and the South Vietnamese people really were grateful for the assistance we provided. For a while, at any rate.

History has painted a somewhat different picture, however, and these shamelessly agendaized propaganda films are one of the few surviving records of how things went until somebody wrecked all the fun. War is a nasty, vicious, horrible thing, and as Captain Kirk said the only good that can come of it is it's ending. The purpose of it is to break things and kill people and for that matter these films are quite refreshing in depicting our military industrial complex's zeal for doing so ... just without all of the humanist content of the later Hollywood drive to tap into our collective national guilt over the results. It is downright surreal to witness some of these events, especially with the bizarre narration praising things like napalm, defoliants, ruthless intelligence networks, and the gung-ho ""can-do"" spirit of our men in uniform. There is no apology for the tonnage of bombs, millions of bullets, determination to prevail and lack of remorse for the consequences, both good and bad. And don't think for a minute that the camera shies away from the casualties, they are shown to make a point about the inevitability of loss and teach viewers to be pragmatic about it. To make an omelette you gotta break a few eggs, see.

About the DVD presentations all of the transfers appear to have been struck from the original film stocks, most of which were 16mm and probably screened between attractions at your corner cinema to white middle class male audiences who nodded with approval while lighting up fresh cigarettes from the snack stand. Some come from more degraded sources and for my money they are even more disturbingly surreal for being tattered & worn; evidence that people actually did sit through these at one time. The only real complaint I have is that each individual ""chapter"" or program can only be played at a time -- there is no continuous play function in the DVD menu, and sadly as can be expected for budget line public domain trash DVD production there is no accompanying text to explain exactly what you are seeing. The sheer magnitude of material far from compensates: 1042 minutes, or roughly 23 hours of footage that contemporary thinking would have you believe never even existed. And to answer in advance a question from those who like me may own a few other collections, there are indeed identical programs as seen on stuff by Brentwood/BCI, St. Clair Vision, Platinum Disc & others. There's just a heck of a lot more of it, and without some of the clumsy editing done by those other companies to make it appear like this was their own work. Mill Creek at least has the balsam to show you exactly what these movies were really about, warts & all.

Is it ethical to think about this as entertainment, though? I have been wondering about that since first discovering these collections and seeing the overwhelmingly negative comments left by people who didn't understand what they'd be getting. I think that's what might bug the majority of those who have left and will continue to leave negative comments, having bought these collections expecting something else. Therefore some criticism aimed at Mill Creek and the other public domain companies who publish DVD compilations of this stuff is in order -- When people read ""Vietnam War Documentaries"" they think about grim, hard-hitting exposes that examine the human cost of the conflict, preferably on both sides. By comparison this stuff is one-sided, upbeat, lacks any regret, and nearly comes close to celebrating the Hell that is War without even batting an eyelash. It is a profoundly weird thing to witness.

So be forewarned: Unless you have a twisted sense of humor or an appreciation for (or need to learn about) US government produced wartime propaganda, you might want to stick to something by PBS, or even just rent APOCALYPSE NOW, because you won't get any of that liberal mamby-pamby apologist humanizing here. But for anyone with maybe a need to learn about how war is sold to people who couldn't even pronounce the names of the towns (sound familiar?) this stuff is priceless, and evidence of a masterpiece of applied surrealism on a horrifyingly grand scale.

In fact you could go so far as to say this is interesting but when are we going to talk about Vietnam? This is a warhawk set where the enemy are all evil and the allies are all saints. The world is not like that.

The problem is that like it or not, the Vietnam War was about politics as much as anything else (some say it was really about the oil). You cannot make a competent overview and ignore the home front. Younger people who were not around at the time will frankly learn next to nothing from this set, beyond some logistics. Let me put it this way. Many Americans want to blame the protests at home for losing the war. If this is true, how can anyone pretend to cover the war and ignore this? It is like WWII with no Stalingrad, no D-Day and no Atom Bomb.

In summary, if you ALREADY know much about the Vietnam War, you might learn more. For a military historian, focusing on the military and the military only, it is darn good. If you are younger and not familiar with everything that was happening at the time, you will learn close to nothing. Because NOTHING in these period documentaries has anything to do with the real reasons why we lost. The topic is taboo. This set is going to give people the complete wrong idea about the time.

Twenty three hours of vintage TV footage and decent quality, I cannot say it is a bad deal. Actually it is an excellent deal for the prices here. Just know what you are getting.",1430352000,,1542,4.273972602739726

171670,2,0870204556,"I bought this out of the $5 bin at the local Walmart - I figured it would be the typical History Channel-type presentation, dealing with the gradual buildup of the war, the growing protest to it, and the gradual swing of majority public opinion to a stance against the war.  I was a bit surprised, frankly a bit shocked, to see that it was just a collection of Defense Department-produced films, which, as other reviewers point out, are basically just propaganda pieces trying to sell the war.  This would have been alright if the DVD had been labeled as such (i.e. ""An interesting look at the Government's viewpoint on the war"" or something like that), but the back cover represents this DVD as just another  typical documentary of the war.  I am not ""anti-military,"" and I certainly don't agree with a person who commented on one of reviews of this DVD, saying that the soldiers who fought in the war should be blamed for doing that; however, I am a bit concerned to think that younger people who may not know that much about the war would watch this and think that it is a fair and balanced view of it, because it is not, although it is quite interesting for what it is, and does give quite a unique perspective that has not been emphasized in other treatments of the war (perhaps with good reason!)

Anyway, I gave the DVD only 2 stars, because of what I feel is misleading labeling as above, or at least lack of clear labeling as to what this is.  Also, I felt that as a result of this, the DVD was in quite poor taste.  For example, it was a bit sickening to see the spin that was put on some of the battles, such as the section on the battle of Khe Sanh;  the part where the commanding officer was talking about the ""variety of menus"" to be found cooking up in the trenches at the base is a good example of this - he almost makes it sound like a picnic in the mountains...  If you want to read a good account of the siege of Khe Sanh, read ""Dispatches"" by Michael Herr (he also wrote the narrative from Apocalypse Now); he talks about how the soldiers at Khe Sanh used to take anti-diarrheal pills to limit their trips to the latrines, which were more exposed to enemy fire; how the bodies piled up so fast that they had to stacked up beside the medical tent, and there were piles of body parts hastily covered with bloody tarpaulins; how every inch of the landing field was bracketed by enemy mortars, and you never went anywhere at less than a run (he actually lived on the Khe Sanh base with the Marines for an extended period during the middle of the siege).  I'm not taking away from the bravery of the men who fought there, but it was a nasty piece of business, and at the end, the four plus NVA regiments that were thought to be in the area just melted away into the wilderness, leaving few bodies despite truly massive bombardment around the clock by B-52's for months, which to me just characterizes the weirdness, craziness and pointlessness of that war.

Another must-see moment on this disc is the segment ""No Substitute for Victory,"" when yes, good ol' John Wayne gets up there and tells us how it is...  how those Commies and Reds are hypnotizing the young folks, and asserting that the anti-war movement was obviously a Communist conspiracy...  I have to admit that the DVD is interesting and informative in some ways, in the sense that it's always good to know what ""the other guys"" had to say, but it is a complete distortion of the history of the war as it's generally understood, and to label this as a straight documentary is an almost criminal oversight in my opinion...

171675,3,0870204556,"Before I get into the depths of thought, this is the second video series I purchased by Mill Creek Publications. I was very disappointed with many of the audio snafus and poor dubbing. I am also weary of them finding as many clips and shorts to fill up disk space. They performed the same feat in ""Korea, the forgotten War."" We all know (who grew-up and watched this war on TV, there are thousands of hours of good quality clips from this inglorious war. Bottom line, if I see Mill Creek on another series (no matter how enticing it appears) I will not be making the purchase.

It pains me to pen the above stated comments because this series, in many ways, will have the viewer asking the same questions over and over, ""Was it worth it? Did we belong in Vietnam?""
I don't think we will ever be able to answer those questions 100%. Many of the soldiers interviewed believed what they were doing was right and Freedom was the right path. The Vietnamese people were suffering terrible at the hands of the Vietcong and they attempted to convert the ""Highlands"" and surrounding villages to the ways of the north. Did these people even know what was at stake? Apparently not. They knew nothing of politics and the ways of the modern world. They wanted to be left alone and care for what they knew: farming and family.

The Highpoints of the video (in my humble opinion) were the stories narrated by Henry Fonda (father of Hanoi Jane--she should have been tried for treason), Raymond Burr, Jack Webb, Charlton Heston and John Wayne. Yes, the Duke! I think his story ""No Substitute for Victory"" was excellent especially at the end where he talked straight and plain. No fluff with the Duke, just the facts (as Jack Webb would say).

He pulled no punches and called out the media and the protestors for embarrassing America in the light of the world. It appears not much has changed in the press over the last forty plus years. They tell or show the public what they believe is educational. I remember seeing clips of soldiers being marched into captivity asking for people to call in if they recognized the soldiers. I remember Jane Fonda (Hanoi Jane) being praised by majors magazines, network television as a ""true patriot"" as she straddled a SAM missile. Her father, Henry ( A WWII B-17 pilot) should have shackled her or forced her to resign her citizenship. My sister thought she was very brave. She was a traitor.

Okay, I'm getting off point. My apologies. That was another flaw with this production, There were only two shorts covering and interviewing those who were opposed to the war. The only antiwar position or  a better term, ""disillusionment"" from the military perspective is provided by Major General Mark Clark who eventually succeeded General Abrams. ""The government (like Korea) would not allow us to win the war. We were hamstrung from the start and never allowed to fight the enemy on his home front and win."" Is history repeating itself?

I went back and looked at a map of Haiphong Harbor and Hanoi. The distance from the shore to the the center of Hanoi was only sixty miles. Why didn't we attempt another Normandy, Inchon, or Iwo Jima and take-out Hanoi? Would this action have taken the punch out of Ho Chi Min or would China allowed him refuge to rebuild, knowing sooner or later the US would pull out? Would we have stayed in Vietnam and occupied it as we have in South Korea, or would the pressure of the press force us to return control to the locals? Those are questions for future historians to examine. I fear they too will be scratching their heads as no definitive message will surface.

I know at times I did my best to suppress the rising anger within as I thought about those demanding peace yet greeted those they wanted to return home by spitting on their uniforms or accusing them of being baby killers. It made me sick. The majority of the men and women who went were drafted. Some resisted and fled to Canada or burned their draft cards. Others hid in the world of Academia and supported anti-war groups. My stomach churned with the scenes of college kids holding up signs of Ho Chi Min and the North Vietnamese flag. Yes, it is our right to proclaim free speech without fear of reprisal by their government, but I go back and wonder what would happen if those type of demonstrations would have occurred during WWII. Imagine thousands marching on the capital displaying the Rising Sun of the Swastika.

Instead of showing the occasional atrocity committed by American and UN Forces (which needed to be covered) why didn't ABC, NBC, CBS, Life and Time show weekly the crimes and mass executions the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Regulars were committing on the local population. Would this have changed our view on supporting the war? Another good question. At times during WWII, many asked why were involved with Europe. In 1945 the American people found out: Aushwitz, Buchenwald, Treblinka, and Sachenhausen. Our questions were answered.

For some of you reading this, I might be contradicting myself on the quality of this series based on the comments.""If he didn't like it, then why is he apparently praising the set?"" Why indeed? There are many good stories and points in the production, but ouy of almost twenty-four hours of documentary stories,  only a small portion (maybe six hours) are worth the asking price of $14.98.

Furthermore, I could never handle the movies ""Platoon"" or ""Hamburger Hill."" This feature is over 23 hours long and when one combs through the rhetoric ""selling"" of the war, there are answers to my questions combined with, WOW! I can see where George Lucas came up with Star Wars due to some of the images that are haunting especially the Stallions then the freight, the machines, tanks, Hueys that are like the locust wind and Cobras, plus one bird looking like an anaconda, all the while including the importance of dogs during war with very intelligent breeds. Some features can be long and repetitive, yet I believe they are either driving a point home or propagating with typical ""war advertizing machine."" I don't ask why anymore and this documentary helped me to understand America's capability yet inabilities more.

No movie or DVD can capture the hell of war. If you have never been involved with a war please do not judge someone who was there. People, all is perception.
Yes, there were times when I thought this subject was not too well done. So what? Are you guys Stephen Spielberg? My dad fought in WWII in Iwo Jima. It was so bad that he NEVER talked about it even until the day he died.
I was disappointed with the negative reviews because whoever put this video together
was trying to convey what being in Vietnam was like.

It's palatable for a while then you just have to turn it off before you feel the need to wrap yourself in a flag and eat apple pie or something.

Maybe if you've served this isn't worth the money to you as you might have already seen them but, one important aspect is the whole sense that Vietnam will be ""easy"". These shorts were obviously produced early in the Vietnam war as the mood is one of overconfidence towards the whole SE Asian campaign.

There's some value to owning this set so, I'd say get it if you already have some Vietnam media but, if you're looking for Vietnam footage that provides a truer picture maybe ""Hearts and minds"", ""In the year of the pig"", ""Cronkite's: The Vietnam War"", ""Two days in October"" or, if you recently struck it rich: ""Vietnam: The ten thousand day war"".",1274745600,28,1009,4.385026737967914

I am interested in learning about the wars we fought mainly Vietnam and was hoping for a comprehensive story that explainss the cause of the conflict, to full out occupation, and to the end. But all you get in this DVD set was a collection of old 1950's-60's style short propoganda films that you may have seen in high school way back when, repeating the same issues over and over again.  Not only was this a horrible compilation of material, the quality of sound and picture was just as bad which made the whole thing just unwatchable.  Most had muffled sound, recorded so low that you must turn the vloume up on your TV then you get a lot of hiss only to have the next segment blarring loud - constant volume adjustment!  A lot of the shows are hard to tell whether it is in color or black and white. There was no effort made to restore the original film, with lots of skips and and lines as you would expect to see in old worn film.

171689,5,0870204556,"These documentaries are riveting viewing for 2 reasons: For the extent and level of propaganda put out by the government to sell this war to the American people, and for the other extreme, the brutal footage of the war itself, as in the ""To Save a Soldier"" segment on disc 4, which shows such incredible heroism among the enlisted men and women. Some are in b&w, some color, and most are in good condition despite their age. There are some clips you will see in more than 1 film, especially the one of Sgt. Bill Belch speaking Vietnamese as he shows villagers how to use a gun. Part spin, part deception, and part truth, this set is a treasure trove for anyone interested in Vietnam, where now the Ford Motor Co. has an assembly plant 35 miles from Hanoi (in a strange twist of fate, Robert McNamara was once a president of Ford).

Disc #1:
1: ""Why Vietnam"" starts with a speech by LBJ, that is interspersed with Hitler and Chamberlain at Munich, a short history of Vietnam including a clip of Pres. Eisenhower. Also Dean Rusk, and Robert McNamara saying ""We seek no wider war.""
2: ""There is a Way."" This one is quite lame...fun and frolic with the Air Force...and also somewhat degraded in film quality.
3: ""War and Advice."" US advisors teaching Vietnamese soldiers. ""American Special Forces are present, but will not take action until fired upon.""
4: ""Another Day of War."" A day in the life of an Air Force pilot.
5: ""1st Air Cavalry."" Helicopters in 1965, with the innovation of using helicopters instead of road vehicles.

8: ""Ready to Strike."" 25th Infantry Division from Hawaii. Includes work with scout dogs.

10: ""Beans, Bullets and Black Oil."" ""The mail must get through,"" as well as other supplies. ""Stretched to new dimensions"" because of the distance from home.
11: ""Operation Montagnard."" The Montagnard are a fascinating people living in the highlands, and we see them being trained for combat.
12: ""The Sky Soldier."" 173rd Brigade in 1965, covered by a war correspondent, through dense jungles and difficult terrain.

Disc 2:
1: ""No Substitute for Victory."" Unlike most of these documentaries, this comes from the latter days of the war, with John Wayne as host, and journalist Lowell Thomas and actress Martha Raye as fellow celebrities, as well as many military men who ask us to ""Let the boys finish what they were sent to do.""
2: ""History of the Air Force"" was made after the war, and deals with the humanitarian use, and other aspects of the Air Force. Fabulous footage of jet fighters.
3: ""The Sparrow Hawks."" Small single engine planes that fly low on incredibly dangerous missions.
4: ""This is Parris Island."" Marine Corps recruits in training.
5: ""The Unique War."" ""Helping to build a nation at the grass roots level,"" and ""Winning the hearts and minds of the people.""

8: ""11th Armored Cavalry Regiment."" From their arrival in 1966, history of mechanized vehicles in Vietnam.
9: ""1st Cavalry Division Airmobile."" Helicopters as aerial cavalry, and their many uses in the ""vast tactical arena.""
10: ""The Battle of Khe Sanh."" The battle explained in detail, with David E. Lounds, Col. USMC, starting with the topography of the area.
11: ""A Day in Vietnam."" Narrated by Jack Webb, and refuting the protestors of the war in the US by showing the military ""Winning the hearts and minds of the people.""
12: ""The Drill Sergeant."" A look at the ""man behind the title,"" in the training of drill sergeants and the instilling of leadership qualities.
13: ""River Patrol."" From June 1967, patrolling a 1000 miles of waterways, the ""Lace-like patterns of waterways"" that are prevalent in Vietnam. Very clear, crisp color film quality in this one.

Disc 3:
1: ""Vietnam! Vietnam!."" Produced by John Ford for the US Information Agency and narrated by Charlton Heston, this is a long and well photographed documentary in 2 parts.  Part 1 is ""The People and the War,"" about the dissent at home, and in Vietnam, ""a nation in disorder."" Peaceful scenes of rice paddies contrasted by graphic, bloody images of massacres committed by the Viet Cong. The harrowing footage of emaciated prisoners of the Viet Cong, and our POWs is heart wrenching.  Part 2 is ""The Debate,"" and has intelligent, conflicting ideas presented by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and (then governor) Reagan, Senators William Fulbright, Eugene McCarthy, John Tower, as well as Dr. Benjamin Spock, Dean Rusk, and many more.

9: ""4th Infantry Division."" The 4th had one of the toughest areas to fight in, against some of the best trained Viet Cong. Includes WWI and WWII footage.

11: ""POW. A Report on Captivity in Southeast Asia, 1963-73."" Capt. Charles Redman and Claude Watkins (WWII POW) describe with maps, photos, and diagrams, the many prison camps in the area as well as the ""Hanoi Hilton,"" in this history of what our POWs went through.
12: ""Marines 1968."" Helping out after Hurricane Inez in Haiti, and helping in the villages of Vietnam, Hoa Khanh Children's Hospital, Capt. John Dyer's Combat Art, and much more.

Disc 4:
1: ""To Save a Soldier."" Amazing footage of medics flying into dangerous ground to pick up the wounded, This film is gritty and tragic. Also the nurses preparing the soldiers for return home is astounding.
2: ""For Thou Art With Me."" About the chaplains in the field. This one is half-baked propaganda.
3: ""Khe Sanh."" Non-stop ""shock and awe."" Some spectacular action footage.
4: ""Know Your Enemy."" Behind enemy lines with the Viet Cong propaganda films. Fuzzy audio on this one.
5: ""Nation Builds Under Fire."" Starts with a few agonizing minutes of VP Hubert Humphrey reading from cue cards, then moves to John Wayne, some military men and NGOs, in a film about ""reaching the hearts and minds"" of the Vietnamese people.

12: ""Progress to Peace."" Narrated by Raymond Burr, ""Vietnamization,"" or what it was meant to be and hoped for.
13: 9th Infantry Division."" Starting in 1967, the 9th in the jungle, rice paddies, swamps and waterways.",1266278400,53,8242,4.895490336435218

The amount of actual footage is virtually nil, The sparsely available stock images used to illustrate something that the narrator is saying are shown only briefly, and in their place the vast majority of this ""film"" are what appear to me to be 3D screensaver art, and the occasional picture of a supernova, or some other astronomic scene.

While the narration is fairly good, this was virtually unwatchable. Its only usefulness lies in the narrator's information, but the visual effects used are so distracting, and oddly placed, that even that loses its value. This very easily could have been a one star review if not for the true, and accurate information read by the narrator.

Suggested Uses/Reasons to Watch?

~ One could play it in the background while doing work, or chores.
~ Someone could put it on if they are the type of person that likes to have a TV or radio on while falling asleep.
~ For pure research purposes due to the fairly detailed and accurate information given.
