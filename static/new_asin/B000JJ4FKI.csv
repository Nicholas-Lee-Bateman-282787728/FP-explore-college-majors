2672149,2,B000JJ4FKI,"Take a story line with more miles on it than Peter Falk and cram it full of sit-com cliche and you have ""Checking Out.""  The only thing missing was the laugh track. Rather than waste your time on this much ado about nothing, check out Falk as the dying Dad in 2005's ""Things About My Folks,"" with Paul Reiser.",1168992000,2,309,4.237288135593221
8150745,1,B000JJ4FKI,"My god, this was awful - it was as if this was 1976 - you know, when rapid fire lines delivered by a jewish family was actually funny.  Oh wait, the broadway play WAS in 1976.  This 2006 movie was a case of no chemistry  - that is no timing, no soul - just a bunch of decent actors trying too hard to make 90 year old daddy irascible, let's wake up and LIVE - versions of THAT have been done before.  If you can stand the minutes crawling by - you will probably find a good message there (in a hallmark card kind of way).  Bottom line, the expiration date has long passed.",1522627200,,572,3.982456140350877

8150748,5,B000JJ4FKI,I loved this movie.  It had a beautfiul message of love along with the wonderful surprises we may learn about our family members.,1482019200,,129,4.608695652173913

8150751,2,B000JJ4FKI,"The film features performers who all have done quality work, but their mettle is tested by this script, which at first hearing seems to be a Neil Simon knockoff.  The cast strives to put it across, but, alas, the Simon genius isn't available to them.  In the 1960s and 1970s, Mr. Simon's work was a mainstay of the dinner-theater circuits, and I suspect that even then, the Simon style wasn't for everyone.  The stage play on which this film is based opened in New York in 1976 and closed after sixteen performances.  I wonder if it might have enjoyed more success had it found its way to a dinner theater somewhere, possibly a kosher one.",1370995200,,639,4.530434782608696
8150752,4,B000JJ4FKI,"This is a charming and funny family drama. Excellent ensemble cast, with Peter Falk and Laura San Giacomo as standouts. Very enjoyable.",1188518400,,135,5.181818181818182
8150753,5,B000JJ4FKI,"I liked every minute of this movie.
It made me remeber ""Noises OFF"" because of the fast pace and the continuous laughing it provokes.
I do recomend.",1188086400,5,148,4.518518518518518
8150754,5,B000JJ4FKI,"This film reminded me what a well written and acted film looks like.  If you love smart dialogue and comedy, this is your kind of movie.  I wish more films were this good.
If you liked this film, I suggest that you see ""When Do We Eat"".",1183852800,7,236,4.0
