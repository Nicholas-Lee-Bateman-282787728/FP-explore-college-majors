6339740,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I recently saw the Jersey Boys Play and wanted to have some remembrance of the story.  This is a great movie.  Some language issues with bad words, but it's a true story of the group, and it's probably how they talked.  There were some dark scenes, but the songs overcome any of the darkness.  The music is wonderful.",1527638400,,317,4.413793103448276
6339741,4,B00J9BZOXY,"You love the music, you've never seen the show & are intrigued by the hype
You want to see Jersey Boys, The Movie but don't know what to expect with no spoilers, this review is for you.

I own the Jersey Boys soundtrack & thought just based on music, this should be a good, family friendly, story.
I read reviews which ran the gamut from life changing experience to the Frankie Valli lead sounds like a chipmunk.
My experience is somewhere in the middle.

This is the real story, not the 50's/60's cleaned up version that was sold of The Four Seasons.
Alot of heavy cursing, like in everyday conversations, mob influence & intimidation by the Tommy character.
Alot of criminal activity & jail time interpretted as a way of life.

The Frankie Valli actor wasn't someone with any ""IT"" factor. No spark or draw that I wanted to watch him.
If he was in any other movie, in the future, I'd take a hard pass.
Found his voice was better as an ensemble, it is very chipmunk-like, like a pitch higher than falsetto.
Also,  looks like he's hiding tobacco in his chin, again adding to the chipmunk persona which is distracting.

My favorite characters & saving grace to get through this over 2 Hour movie were Christopher Walken & The Bob Crewe character.
Walken plays The likable Don of the neighborhood. Crewe, a very entertaining  music producer & song writing partner.
These 2 soften the blow to all the extreme behavior and language.

The story is good, the music is there, and there is a fantastic song & dance musical type of panache scene at the credits but,
I'd much preferred I'd just rented this than made the purchase for a few bucks more.

Thought I could watch it again with my mom, as this is her era.
That plan is nixed unless, I want to assault her ears with profanity.
I wanted entertaining performances of the songs I loved not, the image dissolution of the clean hearted group I thought I knew.",1527552000,,1903,4.511627906976744

6339991,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I saw it at the drive-in, which seemed only appropriate. The drive-in experience was classic. ""Jersey Boys"" is anything but.

The continuity department overseeing the film must have been on strike or asleep on the job. Dramatic license is one thing, but ""Jersey Boys"" screws up the timelines of the Four Seasons' story so badly that, by the time the film finishes with their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1990, you feel sorry even for guitarist/singer Tommy DeVito, who founded and damn near destroyed the group in the same lifetime.

It only begins with someone who knows even the rudiments of the band's history knowing damn well that Frankie Valli couldn't possibly have been singing ""My Eyes Adores You"" as a lullaby to his little daughter in the mid-1960s . . . because the song wouldn't even be written until 1974, and Valli wasn't usually the one who provided the germs for their songs, anyway. He began making solo records on the side in 1965 and hit solo paydirt in 1967 with ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You."" Shame Clint Eastwood and his crew didn't remember---he depicts the song as Valli's great comeback record in the 1970s---even as the Four Seasons were still together as a hitmaking proposition and charting in 1967 and 1968, even if Joe Long replaced original bassist/bass voice Nick Massi in 1966.

The film says ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" was co-composer Bob Gaudio's bid to shake Valli out of his depression following the death of daughter Francine. Good call, guys: Francine was killed in 1980, six months after stepdaughter Celia was killed in an automobile accident, by which time Valli's second run as a hitmaker (beginning with the aforesaid ""My Eyes Adored You"" in 1974) was just about finished.

And it was ""My Eyes Adored You,"" not ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" as the film depicts, over which Valli and Gaudio (keyboards/vocals/chief co-songwriter) had to fence to get it released at all. The third-generation Four Seasons (Gaudio had retired from touring and begun concentrating strictly on writing and producing---as he still does; Massi's replacement Long had left the group; and, DeVito was long enough gone, too, about which more anon) recorded it while they were under contract to the Motown subsidiary MoWest, but MoWest refused to release it. Valli and Gaudio finally convinced Private Stock Records to take a chance on the song, and it went to number one, launching a terrific comeback for Valli.

What the film got right: Tommy DeVito was the Season most likely to become a made wiseguy if music hadn't come into his life. And he was squeezed out of the Four Seasons over his financial irresponsibility---he was supposed to be handling the band's finances, but he ran up such a deep bill with loan sharks and the IRS over his gambling habit that the group forced a showdown ending with Valli and Gaudio agreeing to pay off the debt in return for DeVito leaving the group and surrendering his share in their formal business partnership.

The problem was that that showdown happened in 1971---not in 1966. The film portrays the showdown concurrently as being the final straw that pushed Massi out of the group. Massi and DeVito did have personality conflicts on the road, but Massi had also tired of touring and wanted just to go home. (The film depicts Massi as having been a Season-to-be from pretty much the early 1950s outset, but he didn't actually join the group until 1961, the year before they started racking up the hits. He left the road but he continued working as the Four Seasons' vocal arranger until the band's contract with Philips Records expired.) Massi also surrendered his partnership in the Four Seasons' song publishing, prompting a name change of their publishing company from Gavadima to Seasons Four; he may also have been put off by a deal between Valli and Gaudio: planning to push Valli as a parallel solo performer by 1965, possibly as a hedge against the Seasons' infighting destroying any career momentum, Gaudio and Valli made a handshake agreement to split the proceeds from that plan 50/50---an agreement to which the two men have lived up to this day, strictly on a handshake.

The Seasons were due to undertake a British tour in 1971; when DeVito was forced out of the group, they put it out that he'd left because of hearing problems. The Seasons weren't inclined to wash their dirty laundry in public; their story may have been as tortuous as the Beach Boys' story, but the Seasons themselves preferred to keep their problems out of the public eye.

The film gives almost little sense of where the Seasons came from in actuality. DeVito and Valli did come up on the rougher Jersey streets, but except for a couple of scenes depicting Valli at home with his parents you get no sense of their backgrounds. Valli seems to have had a somewhat normal childhood, albeit one of some struggle (his father designed displays for Lionel Trains; his mother worked for a beer brewer). DeVito grew up with an abusive father, which surely pushed him to the street life and the petty crime in which he indulged pretty much until the Seasons' career (initially as the Four Lovers) began showing signs of paying off, but it isn't even hinted, never mind mentioned in the film.

Massi is shown as almost a woodenhead; he, too, is given no background shrift. Gaudio---the Season who wasn't Jersey born or (mostly) bred (he was a Bronx boy)---was probably the only member of the group who didn't grow up with any kind of family turmoil, much the way George Harrison was the only Beatle who grew up without family trouble, but the film offers nothing of that background. (The comparison is apt in more than one way: like Harrison in the Beatles, Gaudio was the youngest Season; he was barely out of his teens when he uncorked ""Sherry"" in 1962, after producer Bob Crewe suggested he write a song playing to Valli's vocal strength, especially his shattering falsetto.)

Generally, Gaudio is portrayed as a musical genius who could barely see what else was in front of him until he found out the hard way, which wasn't necessarily true. No mention is made of his actually having been a child prodigy whose parents encouraged his musical passions and who gave a Carnegie Hall piano recital at age seven, before his parents moved the family out of the Bronx into Jersey. The fact that Gaudio was a teenage hitmaker (he co-wrote ""Short Shorts,"" a big 1958 hit for the Royal Teens of whom he was a member at fifteen) before being brought into what became the Four Seasons (by way of an acquaintance with future actor Joe Pesci, a lifelong friend of DeVito's, who pumped Gaudio to the group as a songwriting whip) is mentioned barely in passing.

His finest hour of instant inspiration doesn't even rate that much mention. You can't make any production about the Four Seasons without ""Rag Doll,"" of course, but the song's sweet backstory doesn't even rate a passing hint. In early 1964, Gaudio was stopped at a Manhattan traffic light after leaving a recording session. One of the New York squeegee kids came over and cleaned his windshield for him. He fumbled in his pocket for something to give her but had nothing smaller than a five dollar bill. He gave the girl the bill, anyway. As he began to pull away to turn toward the Lincoln Tunnel back to New Jersey, Gaudio saw her in his rear view mirror---standing in the middle of the street, holding the bill in her hand, gaping at him. And he noticed how she looked in her soiled dress and gaping face: ""She looked,"" he thought to himself, ""like a rag doll.""

When he got home, he wrote a song about her, standing the Seasons' previous hit ""Dawn (Go Away)"" on its head and forging a story about a well-off guy's parents pressuring him to dump the girl from the wrong side of town. With an arrangement that stood Phil Spector's Wall of Sound squarely on its head---Gaudio and Crewe achieved a wall of sound with nothing but Gaudio's keyboard, DeVito's guitar, Massi's bass, Buddy Saltzman's thundercrack drumming (as session drummers not affiliated with the Funk Brothers went, Saltzman was easily Hal Blaine's equal and probably could have held his own in bands like the Rascals or Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels), and an unknown studio musician playing a glockenspiel, behind the Seasons' well-honed voices---""Rag Doll"" was a smash. And the last Four Seasons record by the original quartet to hit number one.

The backstory would have made a remarkable segment in the film. If only Eastwood and company had either known it or bothered to see it for what it was.

The musical performances in the film should outrage anyone who was a serious fan of the Four Seasons in their hitmaking heyday. The Seasons' 1960s records featured the punchy soul-style drumming of Saltzman, but the way the music is played in the film it would put to sleep the grannies in Branson Missouri. The music played in the film (all four actors playing the original Seasons could sing---they'd been in various stage productions of Jersey Boys---and the actors playing Gaudio, DeVito, and Massi could play their instruments) is lifeless, limpen, and punchless, nowhere near the uptown R&B that underwrote the Seasons' original style. John Lloyd Young, who played Frankie Valli on Broadway and won a Tony Award for his effort, cuts the teeth out of Valli's normal tenor and building-shattering falsetto here, and there are moments where he can barely hit the notes. The chunky guitar and earthy bass of DeVito and Massi are flatted into ghastly stiffness by their screen counterparts. The stand-ins for Saltzman (there are several shown in assorted recording studio scenes) look as though the very idea of hitting the drums at all scares them to death.

If Eastwood was that tentative and that uninformed about the Seasons' music, why didn't he just dub the Season's original recordings into those scenes? Some of the group's biggest hits don't even show up except in out-of-time, out-of-continuity snippets if at all. Don't expect to hear anything like ""Save It For Me,"" ""Big Man in Town,"" ""Let's Hang On,"" or ""Beggin',"" among others. And while we're on that subject, don't even think about expecting to see anything involving the Four Seasons' most ambitious project of all, the criminally underrated 1969 concept album ""The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette,"" the group's bid to shed their hip-to-be-square image, Gaudio teaming with folk songwriter Jake Holmes to deliver the material. The album became an anomaly in the group's catalog--""Idaho"" is just about the only song with anything like the classic Four Seasons sound---but critics slowly and surely came to love and appreciate it. (It also featured the first album cover based on a front-page-newspaper design, four years before Jethro Tull got the same idea for ""Thick as a Brick."")

That album might have escaped the band's fan base but it had one fan of note---Frank Sinatra. Ol' Blue Eyes was so impressed with the ambitious work from his fellow Jersey boys that he hired Gaudio and Holmes to write him a concept album, the likewise criminally underappreciated ""Watertown."" (About a man's life following the crackup of his marriage---a subject with which Gaudio was acquainted initimately enough considering the turmoil involving the Seasons' marriages.)

Eastwood couldn't even get one small but critical detail about the group right: They were never billed as Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons prior to 1969, when the billing first appeared on their single ""Patch of Blue."" The standard billing for the group on their records, first at Vee-Jay and later at Philips, was ""The 4 Seasons Featuring the 'sound' of Frankie Valli.""

History has its claims, dramatic license be damned, and you grant it wasn't simple to mulct the Four Seasons' story for even the original stage hit. (The surviving original Seasons cooperated with both; Nick Massi died in 2000.) It probably wouldn't have raised any objections (other than perhaps Valli being discomfited over any depiction that two of his children got dead in 1980, when showing just the one was painful enough for him) to have told things the way they really were, and in the real order in which they happened.

Eastwood and the writers are so inept at understanding real nuances in musical figures that they never once address a critical facet to the Four Seasons' approach: They were somewhat older, with a different kind of working class sensibility, than the rock and roll generation into which they flew forth, and they weren't exactly rebels with or without a cause if you didn't count the street and Mob surroundings in which three of them grew up. ""The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette"" might have satirised American life and culture but it did so from the point of view of thirtysomething men (one of whom, DeVito, was only two years from fortysomethinghood) who'd kicked themselves the hard way into the upper class, not from that of dreamy hippies, college students (none of the original Seasons got much past high school, assuming they went even that far; even Gaudio, the straightest member of the group, quit high school when the Royal Teens were compelled to tour on ""Short Shorts""), or bohemians. It should have been a natural for Eastwood considering his sensibilities outside film, but he doesn't even seem to have been aware that the album existed, considering he's barely aware that the Seasons had more hits than ""Sherry,"" ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""Walk Like a Man,"" or ""Dawn (Go Away).""

The likely (if inadvertent) seed might have been a ""Working My Way Back to You"" track, ""Beggar's Parade,"" in which Gaudio and Crewe questioned the sincerity and credibility of the street protesters beginning to make a larger presence in 1966. (This was the last album on which Nick Massi was a full-time participant.) A beautiful song otherwise, ""Beggar's Parade"" might well have had a legitimate argument, but in 1966 it only reinforced the Four Seasons' image as singles-oriented squares. Eastwood's supposed to be this oddly insightful director who's supposed to have had something to say in his equally shortfallen biopic of jazz legend Charlie Parker (""Bird""), but failing to hone in on the sensibilities behind the Seasons' music---even (especially?) through such a jarring album cut as ""Beggar's Parade""---exposes him as a musical halfwit.

Frankie Valli continues performing and recording to this day. (He made a pleasant but overlooked album of 1960s covers---covers of songs he'd never recorded before in his life---a few years ago.) Bob Gaudio has long since relocated to Nashville and has continued a respected career as a writer and producer since backing away little by little from the Four Seasons in the late 1970s. (Among his projects: Neil Diamond's album hit I'm Glad You're With Me Tonight, the blockbuster Diamond/Barbra Streisand duet ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"" and Eric Carmen's first---and best---solo album, including the two hit singles it yielded, ""All By Myself"" and ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again,"" plus future work by Roberta Flack and Peabo Bryson.)

Tommy DeVito relocated to Las Vegas (some of his siblings already lived there) after his forceout from the Four Seasons with $100,000 in the bank. He ran through it in a year, then took up housecleaning as a profession, marrying a Vegas showgirl who'd quit when her show went topless. He got back onto his feet slowly, raising a family and eventually becoming a recording studio operator and producer, not to mention getting some low-keyed film work thanks to his old friend Joe Pesci. He swears to this day he left the Four Seasons of his own volition, tired of touring, and insists Nick Massi left the group because he wanted to be more of a frontman, though neither is borne out by the actual facts. As for Massi, when his work as the Seasons' vocal arranger ended, he lingered in the music business awhile but ended up fighting a battle with the bottle for years while sometimes painting portraits of peoples' pets for a living.

You'll have to surf the Internet to learn those things, because you won't learn them---as, alas, many other things---from ""Jersey Boys."" The Four Seasons made some of the 1960s' most memorable music, even if it's been short shrifted a) by critics who dismiss them as just a doo-wop group who got lucky with a bunch of hit singles; and, b) by the Seasons themselves, accidentally. (They took control of all their masters each time a label deal ended, leaving the labels with nothing to keep in print, meaning no Four Seasons album---granted most of their '60s albums involved hit singles and filler for the most part, other than the brilliant ""Rag Doll,"" ""Working My Way Back to You,"" and ""The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette""---remained in print very long, leaving their music relegated to assorted anthologies for years.)

It's a shame that both the music and the story behind it got so badly bowdlerised by a filmmaker with so little feel for the music and less for telling the story right, warts and all. Since Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio served as executive producers for both the stage hit and the film, you can't help wondering at which point they threw up their hands and said, more or less, ""OK, we can live with this, long as we get paid . . . ""

One thing the film does allow a hint about turns out to have been true, by the way: the Four Seasons' 1970s hit ""December 1963 (Oh, What a Night),"" in which they tried revolving lead vocals for the first time on a Four Seasons single, really did reference the night Bob Gaudio lost his virginity---at 21, and with a little help from his friends. Except that the film won't let you hear Valli straining to contain a smirking giggle while singing his parts, since he was the only Season left while making that record to know its backstory.",1497484800,,17806,4.853192890059249

Too saccarine-sweet that it literally needed something bad to happen; some tension; something to make you care about these characters besides the fact that they were an amazing band of musicians with great singing and songwriting.  The entire movie, I just wished I had instead, bought the DVD of the band live, just to hear the music, instead of this nauseating storyline.  Believe me when I tell you. I'm not an overly ""picky"" person who normally leaves bad reviews - but this was terrible.  It was immensely overacted, and the accents were so overdone that it just became annoying.  As someone else said in an earlier review, it seemed like the actors were rejects from ""Sopranos"" or ""Goodfellas"" - rejects for a reason...because they either overacted, or fell completely flat.  Part of the problem is that it followed a template of a story that we've all seen Two Too Many times before, and told in the same old cliche format!!!!  If you want to be entertained by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, just buy their music - you don't need this, trust me.  You'll buy it anyway, because it's cheap, and if you're one of the easily-entertained masses, it will flatter you.

6340062,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I recently watched Jersey Boys on Amazon Instant Video. My overall reaction to it: all I can do is add one more voice to the overwhelming majority of positive reviews written about this remarkable biographical music drama about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. This 2014 film, which was directed by Clint Eastwood and is based on the Tony Award-winning Broadway play of the same name, includes among its stars John Lloyd Young, Christopher Walken, Vincent Piazza, Nick Massi, Erich Bergen, and Mike Doyle. I share the view of many that Jersey Boys is a brilliantly acted, written, and directed film. It is filled with most of the most memorable songs of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, all superbly performed by Young, Piazza, Massi, and Bergen.

 John Lloyd Young is especially noteworthy as Frankie Valli, not only for his acting ability, but also especially for his singing. He is so effective with the Valli falsetto that when I closed my eyes I really couldn't tell the difference between Youngs and Vallis singing.

I think the most interesting aspect of Marshall Brickman and Rick Elices screenplay is how it shows Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons ties to a local organized crime boss. As a youth trying to kick-start his singing career in his New Jersey hometown, Frankie Valli apparently had some close scrapes with the law. He managed to elude jail time because he was considered a personal favorite of local mob boss Angelo Gyp DeCarlo, who recognized Frankies tremendous talent and strongly encouraged him to stay on the straight-and-narrow.

I like Jersey Boys so much that I recently added it to my Amazon Video digital streaming library. I also plan to add it to my Blu-ray collection in the coming weeks. Highly recommended.",1489622400,10,1749,4.918644067796611

6340338,5,B00J9BZOXY,"There are a ton of insightful reviews (including some critical ones with valid points.)  My take on the movie is the sequencing and pace require that the viewer pay close attention - especially in the earlier scenes - because the timeline is compressed and choppy. I am still giving the film five stars because it has a realistic feel to it. I have not researched the real story, but I am guessing that it is fairly accurate (for Hollywood) since I own other Eastwood films dealing with music biographies and those have proven to have more accuracy than Hollywood liberties.

The acting is excellent in my opinion, and the NJ culture from the period is pretty spot on. I grew up during this era and have Italian-American relatives in northern NJ and the way the characters talked and sounded just like them.

Compared to the real recordings by the Four Seasons the soundtrack is a little lacking, but considering that the original songs were covered by the cast in their own voices I am impressed.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie as both entertainment and as a somewhat accurate biopic of a band from my own youth. Definitely recommended for fellow baby boomers who also grew up with the music, and will be of interest to die hard fans of all ages.",1481587200,,1246,4.624434389140271

Anyway, If you like Great Music you must see this movie. And if you love Christopher Walken's work you will not be disappointed. Near the beginning I thought, Does Anyone In This Movie Not Steal? Or hijack trucks for a living? Good thing they had the Godfather character to settle debts and disagreements like gentlemen. This is a fun movie. A departure for director Clint Eastwood innuit? One of the 4-stars is for the great finale when the credits were rolling. The singing was outstanding - lip-synched and not, and the acting was a pure joy to watch.",1480118400,,595,4.8431372549019605

I wanted to see how his personal life was handled. While he was no ange in the fidelity department, he was shown as the man of integrity that was the hallmark of his business relationship with Bob Gaudio. Although Mr Young's voice lacks the timbre of Mr Valli, he did an excellent job of recreating the falsetto of the lead singer and the complexity of the man. However, Mr Massi was not as tall as the actor who portrayed him, and the actors who played DeVito and Gaudio were excellent matches.",1473552000,,635,4.389830508474576

6340771,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I waited to see this film until after I saw the Broadway play.  I saw Jersey Boys in NYC on the day of the 2016 Tony Awards and I absolutely loved the play I'd give that 5 stars hands down.  It was fun, had great music, kept moving, and was just spectacular.  The film simply failed to capture the fun of the play.  In contrast, I prefer the movie Grease over the original play.  Randal Kleiser was able to capture that magical ""lightning in a bottle"" with Grease and enhance that play while Clint Eastwood wasn't able to do that with Jersey Boys.  The closing number in both movies shows the contrast; light and fun outdoors, vs dark and brooding on a sound stage.
Call me crazy but I think it was a mistake to adapt the play to the big screen.  As I was watching the film I saw a Scorsese film wanting to bust out.  This one would have been great with a gritty screenplay.  Having the realistic Italian dialogue, mafia connections, and conflict coupled with a great Four Seasons soundtrack would have been right down his alley.",1470182400,,1029,4.373684210526315

Nicely packaged story of the Four Seasons rock group that we and many others grew up with, filled with songs and a glimpse into the life back in the 1960's.  I thought the Gyp mob boss character played by Chris Walken was far from his best work, though, stilted and just not believable, at least to me.  All told, loved the story, which was more nuanced than the stage production, but maybe the songs were better on stage due to the ""live performance"" factor.

6341013,3,B00J9BZOXY,"First, I am a huge fan of the Four Seasons and love Frankie's incredible vocals.  His rendering of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" is one of the most powerful and heartfelt love songs ever made.  My personal 4S fave is Rag Doll.

The actors who played the part of the Four Seasons delivered impressive performances, and the lead singer who played Frankie Vali (John Lloyd Young) nailed it real good. The ""Joisey"" accents came across as pretty authentic, especially Tommy Devito's (Vinnie Piazza). The '50s period sets, from the clothes, the shops, and especially the CARS, was a real visual treat for anyone who lived through that period (or wished they could have, like me). The mob association was interesting, and seemed to fit well, even if it reinforced the stereotype of Italian-American connections to Mafiosos. Part and parcel of the gritty New York-New Jersey racketeering reputation, right?

Jersey Boys could have been a GREAT film, but turned out to be much less than that, for three main reasons:

1.  The profanity is completely over-the-top and totally UNNECESSARY!  Just one F-bomb after another. At first it's ridiculous, until it simply becomes tiresome.  The movie would have been greatly improved with family-friendly dialog, but is sullied by a lack of cultured verbal skills. Same level as rap-crap ""speech"" one expects from gangbangers in the inner city. No different from most of the boorish trash that taints most movies today. The only thing missing was shock-jock Howard Stern. One full star subtracted just for the gutter language.

2.  The ""in-your-face"" narration, wherein the actors speak directly to the audience, is annoying if not distracting. This technique interrupts the flow of the story-line, and has the effect of temporally removing the viewer from the scene to constant sidebars that actually defeat the ability of a movie to ""immerse"" the viewer. If Eastwood wanted to explain the scenes, he could have at least used the ""voice-over"" narration technique, which allows the story-line to flow seamlessly, and if used correctly, actually enhances the plot.  Half-star subtracted for actors directly addressing the viewer.

3.  The dark, melancholy atmosphere that permeates the film, due to the constant bickering, insults, and most of all, the entire dragged-out sequence covering the drug addiction, death, and sad funeral of Frankie's daughter Francine.  For a movie that is supposedly focused on the rise of the Four Seasons and their blissful music, it was a real downer to slog through the grief of the girls tragic death. Very dispiriting. Eastwood should have completely cut that subplot from the movie, thus raising the Fun-meter. Half-star subtracted for depressing the audience while adding 15 wasted minutes of gloomy filler.

Luckily for those who want to see the movie with most of the trash cleaned out, there are at least two companies out there which offer cheap filters allowing families to watch the movie either by streaming or DVD without being dragged through the mud. (Do a Google search and you will find them, as Amazon may not allow them to be named in a review like this.) For those who have video-editing skills, you can also do your own filtering, using widely available software that will allow ""custom"" cuts for your personal tastes.  Just make your own version without the expletives and miserable subplots.

For a director of this stature, one would expect better, much better. Shame on you, Eastwood.

Production numbers perfectly realized , dazzling . Personal drama, well..,,only valli and devito characters shine. Some supporting performances look like failed auditions for the sopranos . Historians will be disturbed that Eastwood ignores the fact that in 1956 the Four Lovers had a national hit and that their liaisan Joe Pesci was no small time guy, either , w a King Records contract . The real life musical timeline handled poorly - was it 1967? 1974? I gave up trying . And I have all those records !!",1466294400,,670,4.834782608695652

Everyone knew the songs by heart sang along with great enthusiasm! I don't think  I have ever seen this many nudists sing in unison! The storyline of the movie was compelling and the music was glorious! This showing rivaled ""Halloweentown 2"" for sheer excitement and the acting was fantastic.

6341251,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Frankie Valli and Clint Eastwood!  What could go wrong?
I saw this in the theater with very high hopes, and I found the movie very disappointing.  The only reason we care about the Jersey Boys is for their singing and their many hit songs.  Instead, Clint clipped the songs and substituted low-grade melodrama and over the top emoting.  The Tommy DeVito character especially verged on parody, but the entire state of New Jersey could probably bring a successful defamation suit--the movie makes everyone from New Jersey (most of the characters) sound illiterate and illegal.
I bought the DVD and watched the movie again with vastly lowered expectations, and it didn't seem quite as disappointing.  The high point is when The Four Seasons sing ""Sherry"" on American Bandstand--great song and great choreography.  The dramatic parts remain forgettable.",1464566400,,849,5.205882352941177

6341309,5,B00J9BZOXY,"The movie gave more depth to the story and characters of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I saw the stage show twice (not the original Broadway cast but the tour company) and I love it and couldn't get enough of it. So the movie was a welcome ""refresher"" and it did not disappoint. . Jersey Boys is poignant, nostalgic, and funny.  I just wish deleted portions of the movie were added as a special feature of the DVD. To differentiate the movie from the stage show, I would say that the music in the stage show created the story; and the story in the movie created the music. The acting was great in spite of the lack of film acting experience of most of the cast. They were so natural. I thought John Lloyd Young did a good job of portraying Frankie Valli--it is not easy to get into the character of a seemingly reticent personality. JLY must have studied Mr. Valli very well that he was able to show even the latter's mannerisms.",1463356800,,935,4.3428571428571425

I would pay to watch the show again. I had seen the movie prior to watching the show but that didn't change how I felt about the movie. As soon as I got back from the show, I bought this movie and a couple CD's. I can honestly say that I watch this show every Friday night before or as I am going to sleep. Franki's voice in the movie helps quiet my mind and puts me into a deep relaxing state and almost always I fall asleep to the movie - it's just one of those comforting movies. Reminds me of when I was a little guy, I had to watch the Land Before Time or the Lion King before I could fall asleep. It actually got to the point that my mom would just put one of those movies on as a ""night light"" and/or a bribe to get me to go to sleep. This movie is like that... Funny, comforting (as I grew up listening to my grandparents playing oldies or doo-whop), and moreover just down right entertaining!

6341383,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I was disappointed with the movie.  As a play I am sure it was quite good and enjoyable.  However, when moving to film, it has to be better.  The story was not well developed.  There were many things never mentioned in the film which are historically important to the rise and fall of the Four Seasons.  Such as the British Invasion of the early 60's.  That had a huge lasting effect on all music at the time, and still does.  There were few clues as to time periods as the story progressed.  Having lived through the 60's and loving the Four Seasons, mentioning years would have been helpful, even though I could guess the time period.  Others may have no idea.  It's about context.  There was not enough of that throughout the story line.  Very chopped up and hard to figure out.  The acting was very good, but the writing was just okay.  Hard to believe it was directed by such a famous man who usually has his name attached to much higher quality films.",1462147200,2,957,4.394285714285714

6341386,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Saw the Las Vegas production at the Paris Hotel and then saw the movie.  Both follow the plot line pretty much the same, even the dialogue is almost identical.  Both are great to see but with distinct differences.  The live show has more impact with less props and scenry with more emphasis on the singing and dancing.  So the live show is very visually entertaining and the singing was fantastic.  The movie is more subdued and intimate.  The movie emphasizes the characters and their emotions.  I think seeing the live show and then the movie gave me more perspective to appreciate the nuances of the characters and their interaction with each other.  In the movie, Christopher Walken was much more believable as Gyp, but that's only because it is Christopher Walken.  Both the live show and movie, the characters were played well and sang amazing.  Although, I give hats off the the actor who played Tommy  DeVito in the Las Vegas production.  He was amazing.  Loved both live and movie equally for the reasons noted above.",1461888000,,1026,4.761363636363637

6341418,5,B00J9BZOXY,"If you are a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, this is a must buy.  Even if you're not, their music is pretty hard to walk away from or it was for me.  The numbers sound excellent and the performances seemed very authentic to the real group.  Eastwood has done plenty of biopics and yet again, he delivers another one very well done.

The story itself is about four guys who manage to get out of normalcy into the world of music and touring.  Vincent Piazza seems much like his Boardwalk Empire Lucky Luciano as far as the attitude, but not nearly as murderous of course, as Tommy DeVito.  John Lloyd Young gives a strong turn as Mr. Valli, who is the angel voice of the group obviously.  All four members are showcased pretty well and have moments where they speak directly to the camera in first person.  There are a few piano cues which has become customary of Eastwood's films, especially in recent years.

If you love a movie that has solid drama and great music, this one's for you.  And plus, Christopher Walken plays Gyp DeCarlo and is as always, excellent, as well as funny.",1461715200,,1092,4.442211055276382

6341629,5,B00J9BZOXY,"It is truly like its says in a quote on the dvd case ""Everyone remember it how they need to "" So you may not see anything i am saying here in this movie and have a whole different experience.
For me it was like the quote from Mike Wilber NBC news, ""Clint Eastwood brings the magic to the screen"" (Eastwood is the director) . But you HAVE to love the sixties music to get this movie and to enjoy it because that much of the movie IS that...and to an extent reflects the mind and hearts of those of us from that era, which that music was so appealing to. (Simple, sincere, heart, self liberating authenticity, love, make love not war, question authority (but don't shoot them!), BE the change you want to see,  and so on)
i loved this movie. LOVE  the music,  the story itself, the acting, the lighthearted presentation of serious incidents /acts/decisions with serious consequences, that makes anyone walk away feeling freer and easier about their own challenges too and that they will simply not take us down. A fabulously well done portrayal of the characters by the actors. The music is fantastic if you liked those ""oldies"" which i always have (i am from that time so especially relate).  At first i  thought i was going to be bored, things seemed a little trite and slow moving or like it might be dumb drama but (it wasn't...it was well done actually and after you watch the rest you understand the slower pace and what seems like its dumb wasn't ...in the whole context of  what is coming.  Once the film got past the focus on introducing the characters and the opening story line and moved deeper into the real and true deeper personal issues, dreams, desires, struggles with blocks to these and keeping hope up, the pace picks up and the music gets EVEN better and better and the plot more interesting, especially because it's revealing the private thoughts, feelings and challenges of the musicians and mostly about the main character, Frankie Valli and what we or most of us didn't know about him.  I always loved their music (The four seasons) but seeing what we didn't get to see in those days....enhances our experience of the music and the mere existence of this group and how they did what they did and how it evolved.  Their story is worth knowing:  how they got to be together in a group....how they worked with each other, their original name for their original ""group"" and how Frankie's incredibly unique voice and style and words to his songs changed and grew with his own personal growth. And what a mesmerizing voice it was and became even more so.  Just hearing and watching them sing was worth seeing the movie but they gave you much more than that.  I fell in love with all the guys and their different ways of seeing and doing things, and then seeing how such an incredibly diverse group of individuals could come together and produce such incredible sound/harmony in most provocative sounding blend of all their voices , instruments, and different personalities .  It was very very interesting too to see the kind of person Frankie really was on the inside and to get to know him and the others from that perspective.  That and more that you have to see the film to appreciate,  made me and others i know want to see this movie again and again....just for the sheer fun and joy that is in it even in the midst of some of the seriously difficult times. I can watch it over and over and not at all be bored like at first i thought i was going to be..It's completely the opposite affect.
It is not any kind of hugely impactful or dramatic presentation as some films are when about some person's private life who was a ""star"".  I think though it does leave you with new insights and understanding about people , maybe even yourself , that you  don't realize at the time because OF how light hearted  it is and they ARE, that that catches up with later (what are some unexpected influences on how you see your own life and your mind and heart too) as it just sort of takes you on a journey ...a ride through the hearts and minds and music of these really actually beautiful souls.  And makes you want to know them and be their friends too.  I think it is the kind of movie you want to see when you are not into heavy drama...or dumb comedy (this IS funny , but really funny not dumbed down humor or that you have to be stupid to get it. And when it's done you feel like dancing and singing yourself. or watching it again for the feeling you get from it and the experience of almost being there with them as though you are one of them, learning what they are, overcoming the same challenges, and faced with the same kinds of decisions and keeping yourself going forward and happy so you have soemthing worth giving to those you love....and to yourself.  That is what i took away from it.  Hmmm.  Maybe i will just go and see it again now....smile.",1456012800,3,4868,4.438832772166106

It is by director Clint Eastwood and he's never done a bad movie, it tells the story of how Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons met and started out and their rise to fame it's ups and downs and everything along the way and it's funny too!! John Lloyd Young who starred in the original Broadway play as Frankie Valli stars in this movie as Frankie Valli, Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio, Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi, and Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito.  They are all amazing actors and singers.  John Lloyd Young sings better than Frankie Valli in my opinion, no disrespect to Frankie Valli.",1453507200,,696,4.4296875

6341779,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I have never seen the Broadway production of this show, so I can't compare the screen and stage versions.

I can say that this film is a dreadful turkey from start to finish.

The problem is the cast.  With the exception of the great Christopher Walken as a mob boss, every one of the actors here is almost entirely unlikable, devoid of charm and charisma.

Of course, the Four Seasons hits are as wonderful as ever, but the film drags notably in the second half as the group is falling apart and you realize -- you simply don't care.  You're not invested in any of the characters as they're portrayed here.

Really, the only positives on display beside the hit songs are the cars of the eras shown.  Good work, classic car wranglers!

Otherwise Four Seasons fans would do well to stick with a CD of their greatest hits and pass on this epic fail.",1453420800,4,847,4.419354838709677

6341804,4,B00J9BZOXY,"I first decided to hate this movie when first one of the main roll begins to talk through the camera just like the movie FATHER OF THE BRIDE.
But I couldn't. Even thought there are some bad moments through out, this is a great film after all.
Clint Eastwood is a really really good director. I have to admit that.
Great songs really ring my bell every time they sing.
And each episodes are so charming and lovable.
After two members went their own way and the main member finally sings the solo song, that moment was very exciting and even beautiful. It was regaining the success after all the egony!!
I was surprosed I knew almost all the song FOUR SEASON's sing.
They were all very beautiful.
This movie is not as good as BIRD but very well made movie about a musican(group),",1452297600,,777,4.402777777777778

6341807,4,B00J9BZOXY,"I've always been a fan of the Frankie & the Four Seasons. They had put out some great and timeless music. The movie was just ok in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of actors turning to the camera and talking to the audience which happens a lot here. The acting isn't the greatest either but, I guess the intent was to showcase the music anyway. After all I believe the screenplay was adapted from the Broadway Musical. John Loyd Young's voice is a little too nasally in the beginning. Though I believe they were trying to show the evolution of the singer's voice. 4 stars because I love the music.",1451692800,,594,4.3125
6341818,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Some IMDB reviews hit the nail on the head. The musical was music with a storyline. Clint's retelling is a storyline with some music.

6341876,2,B00J9BZOXY,"After watching this (yes, for all two hours and 15 minutes of my life I will never get back), I simply had to put on some ORIGINAL Four Seasons tracks to clear the truly awful aural pollution of the movie's versions from my eardrums.  As many other reviewers have noted, the Broadway production's music, pacing, and focus all handily trump Eastwood's mopey, tiresome, and utterly bleak take on this classic pop group's story.  I can usually find something to admire in Clint's films, regardless of the subject matter...but ""Jersey Boys"" is a sad exception to that rule.",1447718400,,569,4.855670103092783

I would have to put Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons in my top 3 favorite groups of all time.  I can remember exactly where I was the first time I heard the song Sherry like it was yesterday. If you are a baby boomer this movie is a must see to not only discover the true story of the most popular American group in the sixties and to me of all time but also to remember a special time in their lives. John Lloyd Young is wonderful as Frankie Vallie and what a talent he is as a singer and actor! We all just assume that famous people have it easy but this story shows the reality and consequences of stardom.  And then you have the music, the wonderful, fantastic music that instantly lifts your spirits, takes your mind off of your problems, makes your body swap and slaps your hand against your leg.

The acting was good but the film itself was a letdown to me. I much more enjoyed the way Kevin Spacey did Bobby Darrin in Beyond the Sea. The Spacey movie was not all fun and games but the way he did it make the movie just flow so easy while I felt the Jersey Boys was jerky and jumped from here to there. I really wanted to like it but it just fell flat for me.,1442793600,,493,3.75

6342125,5,B00J9BZOXY,"There's a reason why the play and movie have such tremendous impact across the generations. We just can't get enough of the innovative boys from Jersey who changed the face of music, the culture of a generation, and stood the world on its ear. And for the first time, the public knows how high a price Frankie Valli paid in his journey to bring his dream, his heart's passion to us; and the genius of prolific singer/songwriter Bob Gaudio. (Thanks due here to Joe Pesci for introducing them.) The story behind the music gives depth to your appreciation for the music that everyone can relate to.

Together Mr. Valli and Mr. Gaudio, the heart and soul of the group, and are the pair that will beat any full house. They made history; time has not eroded the magnetic magic of the Four Seasons, but rather amplified it until someone realized that this generation should know their inimitable, magnetic music, and their unexpected, captivating story as well, from the stage to the big screen. We just can't get enough of the boys from Jersey. I wish the movie was hours longer. I've watched it many times since I bought it. The elated feeling of hearing ""Sherry"" is as impactful as the first time I heard it when I was fourteen. It was the sweet promise to a young girl of wonderful things to come. ""Can't Take My Eyes off You""...falling in love at first sight that lasted a lifetime, and is just as heart-racing as the first look, every time I hear the song. Pure magic, and no one else can take you there like the Four Seasons. Whether the love lasted a lifetime or not, the thrilling feelings of the time it takes you back to, or experience for the first time, are eternal. All you have to do is press ""play.""",1441584000,2,1708,4.4743589743589745
6342126,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Enjoyed the music, top rate. Enjoyed the story line. It was a bit distasteful to hear that strong, to me phoney, Yankee or I guess Jersey accent. It seems a bit boisterous and off putting. Will enjoy replaying it over the years. Critics hate it though. Maybe because there was no nudity or profanity or X rated scenes.

6342130,5,B00J9BZOXY,"After recently seeing Jersey Boys on Broadway, I wanted to see the movie. For the most part, the film is a very faithful translation of the stage show to the big screen.
Jersey Boys is the semi-biographical story of the Four Seasons band and their famous lead singer Frankie Valli. From working-class obscurity in Belleville, NJ to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Four Seasons struggled against their own inner demons and interpersonal quarrels. The show features excerpts from all of the hits that the band is known for, though sometimes they are sung at times in the storyline that aren't accurate.
Clint Eastwood's filmic touch is most obvious in the comic safe stealing scene at the beginning, and in the reprise and credits at the end. In between the film is almost shot-for-shot with the stage show. The main differences are the development of the character of Gyp DiCarlo for Christopher Walken. Frankie Valli in this version has a long-standing relationship with Gyp, and Gyp has befriended him long before he becomes a singer.
John Lloyd Young is absolutely fantastic as Frankie Valli. He hits all the notes.
If you're not going to see the live show, see this movie.",1441497600,,1179,4.812807881773399

6342176,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I never ever write product reviews. Ever.

Now I've seen Jersey Boys on Broadway at least 6 or 7 times over it's incredible run. This movie NEVER reaches the energy level that the stage musical does.

Eastwood made some fatal decisions when deciding how he would put this film together. First of all, I applauded his decision to use stage actors to play their roles in the film. Unfortunately, he clearly spent little to no time training the stage actors on how to act for film, and it makes some of the performances hard to watch (and is why Piazza is the only one who shines, despite Lloyd Young having won an Oscar for the same role on the stage).

The fun of seeing Jersey Boys in the theater is that it's basically a concert. Clint Eastwood clearly completely misunderstood the strengths of the stage musical and had he had a hand in the original production, it wouldn't have ever made it to the broadway stage. In Eastwood's film, the songs take an uncomfortable back seat to the narrative.

The positive reviewers have either never seen the stage musical or are feeling too nostalgic to see this trainwreck for what it truly is.",1440806400,6,1135,4.5763546798029555

6342272,3,B00J9BZOXY,"This film by Clint Eastwood is a theatrical version of the stage musical Jersey Boys which narrates the story of the rock iconic group Four Seasons during their early days back in the 1960's. Many songs from the group are featured such as ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"",""Sherry"",""Big Girls Don't Cry"",""Walk Like a Man"",""My Eyes Adored You"" and many others.

The screenplay written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice tells the story of four young men from New Jersey who are growing up on the wrong side decide to form a singing group that later become an legendary band that released many classic songs.

The film definitely has its musical moments especially when the classic songs are being played on screen. But the positive things about it ends right here as the film is somehow not energetic and interesting as the story of the group is being told. In the end,the music somehow overshadows everything in the movie from the comedic scenes,the characters and the acting.",1438473600,,972,4.81437125748503

6342372,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey Boys is based on the Tony Award winning musical biography of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons 60's rock pop group directed by Clint Eastwood  , The rise , the tough times  , personal clashes & ultimate triumph  and how a code of honour they learned on the Streets of New Jersey got them through Gambling debts , Mafia threats  and Family disasters who's music become influence by a generation with songs like Sherry - Big Girls Don't Cry , Walk Like A Man , Rag Doll , December , 1963 ( Oh What A Night ) and many others ,  John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli , Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio songwriter who wrote & co wrote most of the groups biggest hits , Vincent Piazza as Tommy De Vito singer guitarist who worked for mobster Gyp Decarlo and Michael Lomenda as Nick Massii  background singer play the Four Seasons and Christopher Walken as mobster Gyp DeCarlo .

I  saw Jersey Boys on my satellite TV Channel and really enjoyed the movie so bought  the Blu Ray and soundtrack CD as well , The Blu Ray picture is  good maybe a bit grey dark in some scenes and sounds better towards the end as for the catchy hit songs are only short except  at the end of the movie are great , The acting and singing is really good by the cast especially John Lloyd Young , the movie is 134 minutes long &  R rated  , I really enjoyed this movie enough to rate it a five for a pretty good show .",1436918400,,1385,4.142322097378277

It shows the all to well human aspects of this group and how it affected their performance and music.  There are so many memories, all of which were grand beyond belief.

6342443,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I loved the Four Seasons, but the movie did not have one likeable character. The lead did a poor imitation of Frankie Valli, and the on screen narration made it so unrealistic.  Christopher Walken must have used this to practice for Captain Hook.  The only time it came alive was during ""Cant Take MY Eyes Off You'"" and the upbeat end title song and dance.",1435795200,,356,4.461538461538462

The music is phenomenal and it amazes me how well John Lloyd Young has mastered the signature sound of Frankie Valli! Although this story is a bit fabricated, the overall story behind the band and their struggles is fascinating and so well captured by the actors on screen. This is one of those movies where you will laugh and cry, which is a sign of a great movie. My father who grew up with The Four Seasons loved this movie and was laughing with me, a young adult who although hadn't lived in the time period, related to the underlying themes of family and struggle of the plot. I won't give away any spoilers in case you haven't watched the movie or know about Valli's life, but the scenes centered around his family were so heartwarming and will surely captivate you as the movie progresses. I own the album as well and sometimes, if it weren't for the better studio quality today, I mistake Young's voice for that of the young Valli in his glory days.

6342511,5,B00J9BZOXY,"'Frankie' (John Lloyd Young) 'Nick' (Michael Lomenda) 'Tommy' (Vincent Piazza) and 'Bob' (Erich Bergen)
'THE FOUR SEASONS'
The boys grow-up and live the wrong side of town where going to prison or even being killed on the streets
is a way of life.
'Tommy' and 'Nick' in between their criminal activity sing as a part of a group performing at night-club.
'Frankie' works at a hairdresser's, he's also pretty close to local mobster 'Gyp Decarlo' (Christopher Walken)
who is quite protective of young 'Frankie' often admiring the lads singing as he works.
Whilst 'Nick' was serving a spell in prison, 'Tommy' invites 'Frankie' to sing with the group, a little along the line
a young song-writer and vocalist 'Bob' offers to write material for them, the four team-up calling themselves
'The Four Lovers'
They had no agent no recording contract, they went knocking on doors, many rejections later, one recording
producer offers to give them a go, however this wasn't the break they'd been looking for the four spent the year
as a backing group for other acts.
They approach the producer asking for the opportunity to record as a group in their own right, they will need to
find $3,500 and a possible hit number to sing along with a better name for the group.
They see a flickering light at a motel called 'The Four Seasons' after a little quibbling the name was adopted,
'Bob' writes four new songs, they find the money to pay for the session at the recording studio, all they now
need is for the song to get Air-Play on the nations radio network.........'Sherry' becomes a world-wide smash-
hit, their first three releases charted at number one, the rest as they say is - History - except..........
The story not only follows the groups rise to stardom, it follows the turmoil that would eventually tear the group
apart, it tells of how fame makes 'Frankie' a stranger to the wife he'd married before stardom and the daughter
who barely Knows him, it tells of the tragedy that strikes.
The story also tells of the seeds of friction that in part 'Tommy' brings to the table eventually leading to the groups
split.
It truly is a very well thought out account of the rise and fall of one of the most important acts of the 60's into the
70's.
The film directed by the legendary 'Clint Eastwood' who has brought many great movies to our screens down the
years, a prolific actor and director.
The film, a touching story that is often uplifting, the music, well, the group certainly recorded many great numbers,
followed by 'Frankie's' solo efforts many of those memorable songs included during the film, it'll get your feet
tapping for sure, the film is both a musical and a convincing drama.

The film was slotted for release in early June and was somewhat overlooked by the critics but once again Clint Eastwood nailed the direction. The film allows certain details from the early days of the boys to be expanded and told in more detail. The film was sent lightning quick and was well packaged and survived completely intact. All in all, a smooth, a satisfying deal with a superb seller. My highest recommendations!",1434844800,,563,4.755102040816326

6342648,5,B00J9BZOXY,"John Lloyd Young is perfect for the part of Frankie Valli.  Sings just like him!  Not even kidding.  John doesn't agree, but even Frankie can't tell them apart sometimes.  From the early life of Frankie, in the movie, John just becomes Frankie Valli.  He takes on the youthfulness of Frankie with ease and beauty.  And speaking of beauty, John ain't at all hard to look at.  lol  (I would love to be about 30 yrs younger).  He ages with grace and wisdom as the movie progresses and shows great restraint in dealing with Tommy DeVitto at times.  The part of Frankie was perfectly cast in the movie and the Broadway play.  JLY  was the very first Frankie and in my opinion the best.  Altho many people have played the different rolls in the play, John is my favorite character.  The other ""Frankie's"" as well as the other cast members are terrific. They all do a great job.  I look for any and all news I can find on this play (movie) as I would give just about anything to go see it.  A great BIG ""Thanks"" to everyone involved in this project. By the way, JLY was the well deserved receiver of the Tony Award for his part in the Broadway Musical and the musical itself won a Tony!  Can't say enough good things about it.

6342663,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Too many historical inaccuracies, songs out of their proper timeline, etc. - and far too much focus on the group's connections with small time hoodlums for serious fans of the 4 Seasons music to fully enjoy.  The Seasons were one of the most important groups of the 60's, consistently doing battle at the top of the charts with the Beatles, Beach Boys and other prominent groups of the time, but very little focus is placed on their musical history.  No attention at all is given to the group's late 60's effort to follow the changing music scene with their semi-psychedelic ""Genuine Imitation Life Gazette"" album, and there's scarcely a mention of either Nick Massi's temporary replacement, Charles Calello, or of Joe Long, who shortly afterwards became the Seasons' new bass player.

""Jersey Boys"" is an entertaining movie that virtually anyone can enjoy, but it's not an accurate telling of the musical journey of the 4 Seasons.  Overall, it's a disappointment for those with knowledge of the band's musical journey.",1433289600,,1019,5.011834319526627

6342756,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey Boys (2914). Rated ""R"". Running Time: 2 hours, 14 mins.
Directed by Clint Eastwood. Frankie Valli was one of the executive producers.

This true story begins in Belleville, New Jersey in 1951. It is told from Tommy's point of view before Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons made it big in the music business and showbiz.
  Frankie Castelluccio is 16. He works as a barber. Frankie, Tommy and Nick get into mischief and all kinds of trouble when they go out at night together. They have a band called The Variety Trio, but when Tommy went to jail, that ended until he was released, but then Nick went in to jail. Frankie joined Tommy in the house band at The Strand club in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After Frankie and Tommy left them, They created The Variatones. The year 1956 was going to put them on the right path with meeting the right person and another name change of The Four Lovers.

In the cast: John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Johnny Cannizzaro, Christopher Walken, Mike Doyle, Steve Schirripa, Donnie Kehr, Erica Piccininni, Barry Livingston.

John Lloyd Young, Donnie Kehr and Erica Piccininni played their roles from Broadway.

Filmed in Kearny, New Jersey and Los Angeles, California.

Option of language and subtitles: English, French and Spanish.

Special Feature: ""Oh, What A Night"" to Remember.

This film could have been so much better with a bigger budget and without the looking-in-the-camera narrative.

Enjoyed the singing of John Lloyd Young. Although he is mostly a stage actor and singer in musicals, I hope to see him in more films and television work.

Con - For the most part Four Seasons original recordings weren't used.  I could go on and on but the result isxalways the same, the pro is the con and vice versa.

My wife said she was surprised I wanted to watch this ""because it's a musical"".  ""It's not a musical."" I said, ""It's a biography about musicians and it has their music.""  ""That's a musical,"" she replied.  It's like no musical I've ever heard before.  The Music Man wasn't like this and IT was a musical.

I am surprised that no one else has mentioned it in reviews. I sent my first DVD back only to get a replacement with the exact same problem and here it is; When Frankie turns and looks at his young daughter at the top of the stairs after ""hearing it"" from with his wife, right then the movie freezes for a second or two and the audio goes away and everything. I started to send back the second disc and try a third but had my doubts. Can someone please tell me if your copy is this way as well, or did I just have bad luck twice, and should try for a third copy without the glitch. I am very particular about how my movies run and this one stinks (not the movie, the questionable copy). As far as reviewing the movie like I should be, I love it like many others on here, but the problem with the way it glitches at that point is keeping me from watching it now. If this is a wide spread problem,then Amazon should first obtain a quality product, then secondly replace every copy that went out with a flaw. so lets hear it folks, is your copy clean?

6342900,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I saw this in the movie theatre three times. I had no reason to believe that it wouldn't play well on the small screen (dvd). Most of the musical performance scenes take place in small venues (recording studios, bars, t.v. studios) and there are many scenes with nothing but loads of medium-shot dialogue, so it made sense that it should play well on the small screen.

So I'm at home watching the dvd and everything is going reasonably well, although the washed-out retro lighting fairly much went out the window as most lighting does when a movie is transferred to the small screen (I wasn't a huge fan of the washed-out lighting anyways).

At any rate, everything is going reasonably well until along comes the showstopping performance of ""Can't take my eyes off of you."" Clint Eastwood's camera work in this sequence is what really makes this an ass-kick. But it just doesn't work on the small screen. Nothing comes out right. The pan shots seem like medium shots. The medium shots seem like close ups. And perhaps worst of all, the swooping camera shots don't swoop with the same panache that they do on the large screen.

All I can say is that I am thankful that ""Can't take my eyes off of you"" didn't arrive until close to the end of the film - because I probably would have shut off the dvd player and not seen much of the movie.

A substantial, but not surprising, disappointment. Stuff gets compromised on the transfer from large screen to small screen. What are you gonna do?

6343026,2,B00J9BZOXY,"Belated adaptation of the 2005 Broadway hit lacks urgency and spark. Clint Eastwood's lethargic direction proves he was the wrong choice to bring ""Jersey Boys"" to the big screen. Aiming for a ""Goodfellas"" vibe, Eastwood sacrifices most of the qualities that made the stage version so engaging. No complaints about the ensemble cast (including a standout Christopher Walken), but Clint stretches out the film to an unwieldy 135 minutes while cutting the Four Seasons' music to ribbons. A misguided disappointment.",1429315200,6,512,5.4125

Although it was a lot of fun to watch and hear the old tunes, which were a bit strained by the cover lead falsetto, I kept getting the feeling that there was much more to the story than was being told.  For example, did they get any help from their friends, making it to the top?

Also, the movie tended to paint some of the players as more villainous than others, when usually in real life, everyone has a part in the downfall. Not to mention the way the movie trivialized and demeaned women.  Still, this musical was somewhat entertaining and I think it was worth a look.",1428969600,,684,4.286821705426356

6343461,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey Boys is a marvelous musical about a variety of rock from the 60s that many have forgotten.  It wasn't just the Doors, the Beatles, Joplin and Hendrix.  The Four Seasons were an all-Jersey band with a terrific songwriting/producing team that produced an amazing string of hits before breaking up in 1970 or so.  The cast stepping in for Frankie Valli et al are probably even better singers.  EVen if you don't remember bands like this, you might really enjoy a lively, fresh, funny, frank and entertaining musical, as directed by Clint Eastwood, and based on the stage version that's still touring.",1427414400,,604,4.892156862745098
6343462,1,B00J9BZOXY,"If you've seen the Broadway show or any tours of ""Jersy Boys"",  the positive reviews many gave this film is baffling. As Andrew Lloyd Weber remarked about his ""Phantom of the Opera"", for a musical to work, all the tumblers have to click.

The same can be said for film adaptations of musicals. It may be that the major problem with this film is that Des McAnuff wasn't chosen to direct it. I never had the sense that Clint Eastwood really wrapped his hands around the script--which I found to be lacking in any real ""theatricality"".

For those who gave ""Jersey Boys"" four of five stars I would suggest watching ""West Side Story"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", or ""My Fair Lady"" to see how skillfully a musical that was brilliantly staged can be equalling enthralling on film. Admittedly these musicals are classics, but by way of comparison watch Rita Moreno and George Chakiris generate megawatts of electricity in the brilliantly choreographed ""America"" from ""West Side Story"" and you just might see how uninspired this film is.

Perhaps a better yardstick to measure ""Jersey Boys"" by would be ""Chicago"", which like the aforementioned classics, generates real heat and would be worth watching if only for ""Cell Block Tango"". I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever in confessing that Eastwood's debut as a director bringing  a musical to the screen is the first movie I had to restrain myself from turning off in a long time. The second, ""Boyhood"" followed on it's heels.

At the end of the day, there just may be some productions that belong only on stage and I believe ""Jersey Boys"" is one of them.

There are real fireworks in the August Wilson Theater where ""Jersey Boys"" has entralled crowds now for 10 years. This film has no more luminescence than a 30-watt bulb.

A pity and a rare miss by Clint Eastwood.",1427328000,5,1831,4.735849056603773

6343464,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I guess I am expecting too much from Clint Eastwood. He has done some terrific directing in recent years. It may be because of the restrictions placed on him because of the Jersey boys back in Las Vegas. I don't know. It was still enjoyable to watch, a little hard at times because these guys are not particularly nice people. I guess I expected good music to come from good people.

If you think this is Mama Mia or Chicago (barf), it is really nothing like those two.  Yes there is music because this movie is about The Four Seasons and their journey from stardom to present.  Dont think they break out in song and dance every 5 seconds like Les Miserable (which I turned off after 5 minutes, sorry Hugh but I just couldn't stand it).  I was very skeptical in seeing this movie but my boyfriend threatened me with see the movie or ill take you to see the Broadway show, Redbox it is.  The movie goes in how difficult it can be to make it in the music industry, while trying to work together as a group.

6343780,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I had high hopes for this adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, based on the life of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Valli and his group have churned out amazing hits -- such as ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""Walk Like a Man,"" ""Rag Doll,"" ""Sherry,"" ""Working My Way Back to You,"" ""December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),"" and Valli's massive solo hit, ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" -- and I knew their roots tied to gangster Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (who also tied Frank Sinatra to organized crime), portrayed here by Christopher Walken. Plus, with Clint Eastwood as director -- a filmmaker who has proven time and time again of his behind-the-camera talent with films such as ""Mystic River,"" ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Unforgiven,"" and the highly underrated ""A Perfect World"" -- I was excited to see what he did with the material. Sadly, what I got was a mess of a film trying to speed through the life of one of the music industry's most influential bands. The story and pacing feel all wrong as there are too many jumps in the chronology. For instance, when a major, life-changing event happens to Valli near the end of the film, in true ""just-suck-it-up"" fashion of which is quite popular among Mr. Eastwood's generation, there is only one short scene devoted to this life-altering event and then it is promptly swept under the rug, never to be mentioned again. Most of this is not Eastwood's fault as he did not write the script -- that falls to the writers of the stage play, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice -- but the editing seemed too choppy and the acting was too over-the-top, leaving me to a few eye-rolls from time to time. Even Walken -- an actor I usually like -- seemed like a caricature in his portrayal of the gangster DeCarlo, making him seem like he was portraying one of his many famous ""Saturday Night Live"" characters. It reminded me a bit of how John Travolta approached his role -- or even Walken's own role of Travolta's character's husband, Wilbur Turnblad -- in the movie adaptation of the Broadway musical, ""Hairspray."" I expected to watch this film and see more of Valli and his bandmates' lives than what I did see: the stereotypical story of a band struggling with each other in the face of success.",1426118400,,2242,4.62155388471178

6343783,1,B00J9BZOXY,"Sucked big time.  Husband & I watched it about 3/4 of the way through ONLY because it was a movie directed by Clint Eastwood.  AND it had Christopher Walken in it.  Mind you, I think Clint's politics are out to lunch.  But he has been a helluva film director (we both loved ""Grand Torino"" & ""Unforgiven"").  But ""Jersey Boys"" was such a giant heaping pile of camel dung ... ugh.  Main character was shrill, boring, & had a pretty uninteresting life for a ""star"".

I highly UNRECOMMEND this movie.",1425945600,2,495,4.49438202247191

I probably order no more than one DVD a year.  That's how much I wanted this!  As I said, it was a great disappointment.  The first half hour was dull, very dull.  Eastwood was obviously the wrong director for this film.  Too old, too stodgy.  The actor that played the role of Frankie Valli was way off musically, as far as I was concerned.  If this had been the real Frankie Valli's voice, he would have stayed in New Jersey and not become famous.  This actor's voice was screechy!

We were teenagers during Frankie Valli's heyday, so it looked very familiar.  The acting was excellent, the singing took us right back to our teen years, and the script was very well done.  We were shocked to learn that the singing was all done by the actors; the sound track is NOT the original FV and the Four Seasons stuff, but replicated for this film.  AMazing accomplishment.

6344088,4,B00J9BZOXY,"The movie was clever in how it told the story of the band.  A bit cheesy at times, but still fun and entertaining.  It was great to have so many great songs to bring back memories and to connect to the storyline.  Worth watching.",1424736000,,229,4.159090909090909
6344089,2,B00J9BZOXY,This could have been a very great movie.  The music was great and the characters were mostly dynamic.  But this felt like a very rushed production and all the cliche's of introducing a newcomer to the group over a song no one has practiced coming out beautifully (which was greatly parodied by Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story) hurt this movie.  The makeup effects are also just terrible.  If you are a huge fan of the Four Seasons then this is a no-brainer and you should watch this.  But if you're looking for a movie that might hit you in the feels with some good music then you should pass.,1424736000,,592,4.345454545454546

6344160,3,B00J9BZOXY,"The ensemble cast IS this movie.  Director Eastwood is slipping; however.  The movie is poorly edited - VERY poorly - and the ending is just too-too. . cute.  Mr. Eastwood should stick to war movies, film enough to use what's left on the cutting room floor to make an entirely NEW movie, and leave well enough alone.

Jersey Boys succeeds in one very important thing:  It revives the uncommon sound of Frankie Valli (and the early Four Seasons).",1424390400,,445,4.653846153846154

6344185,2,B00J9BZOXY,"The Broadway musical of Jersey Boys is driven by the still-propulsive music of the Four Seasons and Frankie Valli - that and the intriguing backstory of these almost-thugs as they became pop classics.  Sadly the movie truncates the music and never puts it front and center until the end, at which point we've lost interest. The acting and stilted scenes feel forced and deflated - when in fact the backstory is filled with danger, incredible drama and intriguing sexual situations. Most of the songs are relegated to background score and those numbers featured do not adequately showcase the talents of the onscreen talents nor do they retain the pop appeal of the original recordings. What happened? This shoulda been a contender!  In the closing credits the original records play and you are reminded of all you have missed.",1424390400,2,826,4.978260869565218

The acting was spot on (and having a wife from Jersey, the movie had an authentic jersey feel to it). The movie flowed perfectly, great acting, the set design and costumes etc were very period authentic. I found myself wishing the movie would never stop.

6344422,5,B00J9BZOXY,"One more film Clint Eastwood dedicates to a musical group he must have liked when he was younger, a group that had some fame in the 1960s and even beyond, Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons.

The music is good but it could not be considered as outstanding if Frankie Valli had not been part of them, had not been the lead singer. Today we would say he was a countertenor, though that sounds too operatic, so we could say he was a falsetto voice and as such, as a radio announcer said, is he a man, is he a boy, or is she a girl in disguise? Who knows and who cares? A voice of that type was of course rare in those days and he knew how to go down to his tenor voice from time to time.

But it is a shame this voice was not worked upon more and was more or less kept unkempt, un-worked, a vocal waste land, a raw voice, beautiful but raw, unsmooth. So it is most of the time more surprising than engulfing and elevating as countertenors know out to be. But of course we are in the rock garden of wonders and as such it is beautiful and fascinating.

The interest though of the film is not only that voice but the story, the plot even, how a group managed to be born, to grow, to reach fame and then to disband and the survivors managed to have a personal career in their turn, and in the end they revive the group for the final lap in their life and career. The group is dominated, haunted, enslaved by Tommy deVito who is a very difficult character since he is authoritarian, capricious and extremely self centered if not egotistic. He makes everyone tense and even defensive and at the same time he gets into some financial debt with the mafia and the debt goes up and up and is finally solved when it reaches 162,000 dollars.

But that is too much for most of the members of the quartet. So Tommy walks out, Nick walks out and Frankie remains alone with his song writer Bob Gaudio and they make it together, a real successful career though life is not easy for Frankie.

Frankie gets into trouble with his wife he hardly sees anyway since he is on the road all the time. Their daughter has reached an age when she needs some authority figure and her mother cannot cope. This ends badly because a young teenager cannot stay in one place more than five minutes. But Frankie seems to have the energy to transform any hardship into inspiration and his song writer is patient enough to be able to reach out and bring the love song Frankie needs to bury his daughter in  his heart and the love song becomes the most beautiful requiem, dirge or tenebrae that hits the ceiling at once because of the feeling Frankie invests in his singing.

A beautiful film about these singers, but also about the hard life of creative musicians and artists who often have to sacrifice their own private and personal life or have very patient and dedicated partners. The rest is plain creativity, inspiration and love, desperate and divine love for your art.

I recognized some of the songs that The Four Seasons are famous for, but the movie itself is average.

6344448,3,B00J9BZOXY,"This Clint Eastwood directed film tries to find the middle ground between a biopic of an iconic band of the `60's and a more traditional musical.  As a result we get a bit of a mishmash of both.  For those unaware, The 4 Seasons were a New Jersey based quartet from the 1960's that rose to fame, primarily on the falsetto voice of lead singer Frankie Valli, here played by John Lloyd Young, who also starred in the original Broadway hit.

The film's early focus is on the backstory of Frankie and his older friend, Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazz).  Tommy had a lot of things going on in addition to his fledgling band.  A minor hoodlum, Tommy and Frankie were taken under the wing of good-natured mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken).  Frankie is ultimately invited to join the band as his voice enthralled the small audiences, especially the ladies.  After song writer/keyboard player Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) joins the band and along with original bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), the band takes off.

Stumbling through a potpourri of names, the band finally settles on ""The 4 Seasons,"" after spotting it on a motel marquee.  The film mostly stays with the trials a tribulations of the band including getting a recording contract, booking dates but mostly the maleficence of Tommy and his money spending habits.  Once Eastwood and screenwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice direct us to some musical numbers, we get some relief from the non-stop bickering within the quartet.

While I would classify myself as an average fan of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, I did appreciate the music if not being over-enthusiastic.  I think the movie should have leaned this way more.  The only hint of Broadway was the talking to the camera trick the various actors would employ, telling us what they were thinking at the time.  Finally as the credits close we get to see a fun sequence involving the entire cast singing and dancing to a montage of the group's hits.  Too late.

The Blu ray version of the film is well presented with a 1080p resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The video looks very good, although the picture does appear to show absence of color at times.  I suspect this is the filmmaker's attempt to show what the 50's and 60's looked like and not the fault of the transfer.  Otherwise the detail is excellent as are the black levels.  I could detect no transfer anomalies or faults.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is even better.  Dialog is clear and intelligible and the music fairly envelops the viewer during the several concert scenes.  The LFE (.1) channel get into the action as well.  Environmental scenes (bars, nightclubs, street activity) are spread out throughout the speakers perfectly.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, Portuguese, French and English SDH.  Extras include 2 short pieces detailing the transfer of the stage production to film and a 5 minute explanation of how the closing musical number was created.",1423180800,,2962,4.8273809523809526

If you come from this PART of Jersey, like me, you'll thoroughly enjoy this film.  It's realistic and tough, heartbreaking and interesting.  The movie does not get sappy, light in the underwear, or overly-theatrical like a typical musical--in fact, it's not a musical.  But it has so many songs performed as part of the plot, that what you get here is an excellent story and excellent concert at once.

Perfect acting.  Quite a few surprises.  Interesting narration techniques--each main character gets to address the viewer directly in these unexpected asides, then jump back into the pot.  Very cool.  Seamlessly done.

What else would you expect from a real man who changed the world of film, Clint Eastwood?  This is the story of some real men from New Jersey who changed the world of music.  Part Goodfellas, part Sopranos, part musical drama.  Just like Jersey, actually.

6344592,2,B00J9BZOXY,"Did we really need a biopic about The Four Seasons? The answer is probably no, but as a fan of their music, I was intrigued. I didn't know much about their backstory, and I've been waiting for Clint Eastwood to make a comeback. His last truly great film was 2006's Letters from Iwo Jima and 2008s Gran Torino were very strong films, but everything since then has been pretty skippable. Still, I was excited to watch this. Nothing about Eastwood's previous films indicates that he would be a good fit for a musical, but I always try to keep an open mind.

I mean, who would have guessed that the man known for films like Dirty Harry and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly would do an excellent job with The Bridges of Madison County, both as a director and as an actor? Who would have guessed that he would direct a film starring Hilary Swank as a boxer that would go on to sweep the Academy Awards? Eastwood is known, at this point, for his versatility, his unpredictability, and his ability to shape-shift.

The Four Seasons are a good band, in my opinion, and the trailers seemed to suggest their hardscrabble backstory was every bit as fascinating as the music; it looked like Singin' In The Rain meets GoodFellas. Obviously, there was no way it could compete with those masterpieces, but as the director of his own masterpieces (like Unforgiven), Eastwood seemed to be a fine choice. Eastwood is known for his conservative approach to direction, shooting every scene in one or two takes, and in this film, he decided to record all the vocals live.

There are musical sequences when members of the band step away from the microphone momentarily and fade out of the soundtrack, but those technical flaws do add to an atmosphere of authenticity; we are watching real performances, and there is an energy you cannot manufacture, especially considering that the actors are all top-notch singers. (John Lloyd Young, who plays Frankie Valli, also played him in the original Broadway production.) It's worth pointing out, though, that the acting skills of the four leads may not be quite on the level as their voices.

The acting is not exactly great, and neither is the script, though it's hard to make such a pedestrian story interesting. The Four Seasons began as young and poor men; they struggled and some of them got on the wrong side of the law, but achieved fame, and then they struggled again. The fact of the matter is, the band's history is just not that interesting. The music is often great, but there's plenty of other groups who made terrific music and had a more interesting history. There's really nothing here that you couldn't get from a greatest hits album from the band, and that's not a good sign.

The film's pacing also seems off. Frankie Valli gets married early in the film, and then that relationship is never brought up again until much later, when he is at home with his wife and kids (who have never been mentioned previously). He's arguing with his wife and they're fighting because he's been away so long. It's obvious that he's been on the road and they feel abandoned, but it could have been handled in a better way.

One scene is truly creepy. Frankie Valli puts his daughter to bed and begins to sing to her, which on paper sounds totally innocuous. The problem is, the song he decides to sing is, ""My Eyes Adored You."" The following are some of the actual lyrics he sings:

'My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away'

Yeah, singing your daughter to sleep and telling her that your eyes adored her, even though you never laid a hand on her is kind of icky.

As the decades pass, the band starts to suffer from financial problems, marital struggles, an artistic drought, and terrible facial hair. The end of the film, where the members are inducted into the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, features the young actors in truly terrible makeup that looks like pancake mix and hair that looks like gray spray paint has been applied. I would have hoped that Eastwood had learned from the bad makeup work on J. Edgar, but apparently not.

I was so ready to see Singin' In The Rain meets GoodFellas, but this is not that film; not even close. Instead, this is a mess from a director who should know better.",1421798400,,4284,4.559167750325098

6344639,4,B00J9BZOXY,"The best part of Clint Eastwood-directed Jersey Boys is of course the music of The Four Seasons. Who can forget such classic numbers like Sherry and Walk Like a Man with Frankie Vallis falsetto?

Another great feature of the film is Christopher Walken, who is as brilliant as ever. He plays a gangster young Valli admires, and really looks more like a surrogate father figure to the boys. Four young actors playing the group members are all very good, especially John Lloyd Young, reprising his Tony Award-winning role as Frankie Valli in a Broadway musical upon which this movie is based.

As a bio-pic, or simply as a drama, however, I think there is something missing in Jersey Boys. Maybe it is a compelling story; or perhaps dramatic tension between characters. The groups success story is well-written, though it takes some time before it gets started. There are several subplots including one about Frankie Vallis daughter Francine, which could have been more effective with more details.

But, as I said above, it is hard to deny the magnetic charms of songs of The Four Seasons, for which I would give four stars.",1421539200,,1122,4.833333333333333

6344642,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I cannot believe Frankie Vali would forgive a man who singlehandedly tried to sink the ship known as The Four Seasons with his gambling habits and other unsavory  methods to become in debt to people you wouldn't choose to hold a $1 bill to. But, instead he owed them well over 1/2 million dollars and lived to tell about it...simply because of Valli's feeling of owing this man for getting him out of the gutter that was Jersey, Mafia Central in those days.",1421452800,,457,4.506024096385542
6344643,5,B00J9BZOXY,Absolutely loved the music; a walk down memory lane. The casting was well done and it was most enlightening to learn the back stories on this group.  Eastwood did a wonderful job with this and I'm happy to add this to my video library.,1421452800,,235,4.340909090909091
6344644,2,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey Boys  John Lloyd Young - Members of our family grew up listening to the Four Seasons' music, so it was fun to hear the songs again, but the story behind the boys is darker than I would have like to have known.  Maybe all of that was in the press when it was happening, but as a teen we were unaware of it and just enjoyed the music, which is still true.  The Four Seasons made songs that stand the test of time.",1421452800,,418,3.9523809523809526

6344652,4,B00J9BZOXY,"As a gen Xer, I find doo wap kind of irritating but this movie was really well done and has a nice mixture of musicality and funny action. The bass singer, whatever his name is, sounds way too goofy though. Whenever he sang, it made me wonder if they were making fun of the Four Seasons instead of memorializing them.",1421366400,,317,4.3
6344673,5,B00J9BZOXY,"My husband and I recently purchased this movie, and immediately watched it upon receiving, because we are big fans of Frankie Valli and the great directing (and producing) of Clint Eastwood. WE LOVED IT!  The movie was so good and so fun, and of course the music of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is just fantastic! (The actors that play Frankie and the other 3 members of the group, are awesome, doing a super job!)  Frankie Valli even appears in the movie as a cameo!  And the ending will knock your socks off!  I am so glad that we purchased this movie, to add to our movie collection, instead of just renting it from Netflix. We will be watching it again and again!",1421366400,,673,4.403225806451613

6344705,5,B00J9BZOXY,"If you're a fan of Frankie Valli this is a flick for you. It gives you the background, and also how the more famous songs were made. The only thing I didn't like about it was, it was a bit hard to know what year it was during the movie and how far ahead we had moved in the film. Other than that, great movie and totally worth the buy",1421193600,,334,3.7857142857142856

6344728,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Loved the Seasons since I was a kid.  Can't believe that Frankie Valli is still singing but this movie, with the incredible John Lloyd Young is an amazing tribute (and if reviews are accurate) and mostly true story of the last of the great doo wap groups.  Though the 4 Seasons were always more than that.  Eastwood does a great job in directing, keeping the story moving and integrating the music.  The finale is almost worth the whole movie.  This is not another mob movie by the way, but if you are a 4 Seasons fan, you've got to see it.",1421107200,,540,4.306930693069307

The movie stayed true to script but only added more meat to the storyline - which added overall value to the experience. Great historical perspective on the Jersey scene back in the day. Other than the abundant use of the F-bomb, this is a nice family movie. That of course depends on the family and their perspective on foul language.",1420675200,,430,4.5256410256410255

6344827,4,B00J9BZOXY,Very entertaining with depth where needed.  Loved the authentic NY- type actors and the music rendered as I remember from years ago. Also the scenery was dead right and where did they find all those 50's cars?  I am not a music lover for films but the movie would inspire almost anyone to understand this group rise to fame and self-destruction along the way.,1420588800,,359,4.59375

It was said ""...one of Clint Eastwood's best in years..."", which it may be, but so quickly another movie (""Sniper"") is being hailed as the same.  I am glad he did the directing, and I applaud his attempt to re-create the times, right down to the Studebaker!!

They didn't change the musical world like the Beatles or even the Beach Boys, but they had a sound like no one before or since.  So, I was afraid that either the music would be inserted into the movie from the real artists or - even worse! - would just not be acceptable.  Also, how in the world were they going to find actors who might be able to pull off the music and still have a real resemblance to the actual members of the group?  But it is a Clint Eastwood film and I don't think anyone can argue that he presents a consistently quality product.  So I bought and I watched it and I was really blown away.  Do they look or sound exactly like the real performers?  No.  But let me tell you, they are close enough!

And curiousity got the better of me.  How close did the movie come to the real and actual events of each member and the group as a whole?  I went online and checked it out.  Almost everything was presented as it actually happened.  I understand they left out a little bit about Franki Valli's stepchildren, but that's all.  It happened just as the movie said it did.

I loved that the movie progressed from one person's point of view to another.  In the beginning, they said the story would be remembered as each person needed to remember it (or something like that) - and doesn't everyone do that?

So, I highly recommend you see this movie.  Very well acted, directed and shot.  And, I personally loved the closing scenes, but not wanting to do a spoiler alert, I'm not going to tell you what it was.  Watch it and see.",1420502400,4,1654,4.2709677419354835

The acting is solid and, while there's plenty that goes unanswered, this gives a pretty solid look into the Four Seasons history and the dynamics that shaped the group. I've not seen the musical live, but this film does a good job with the inclusion of the music--without making one feel like their watching a silver-screen recreation of a Broadway Musical, ala Chicago (well done, but like watching a musical at home).

It was a nice slow paced entertaining story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons filled with good music and a few insights into the different members of the group, but based primarily around Frankie.  Not a bad watch at all.  Directed by Clint Eastwood, who has always loved music, and even an interesting side character Gyp played by Christopher Walken.

6345009,4,B00J9BZOXY,"I did not realize that  ""JB""  was directed by Clint Eastwood -- of all people, not a likely match as was ""Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil,"" which was about a gay murder and a black transexual, not a film that a regular macho guy would choose to make. This film is good. I would have preferred to hear more songs all the way through and fewer depressing facts about the group's shady side. The end was the best part of the movie. Clint's cameo on TV was like Hitchcock's penchant for such antics. Clint did not dare to insert a cameo in ""Garden"" though. I am a Studebaker fan because of the marque's long history, founded in 1852, and its feistiness, if not for the quality of its latter models; so, I was pleased to see a 1947-49 Studebaker Starliner coup used unsuccessfully to steal a safe in the opening scene and a 1953 Studebaker sedan used as a backdrop in the lovely, lively final scene.

Christopher Walken was easily the best actor against a cast of predominantly new faces, many adequate but ultimately insignificant in star quality; John Lloyd Young was probably more brilliant live than on celluloid.

I have seen the stage production of JB four times in three different cities and loved each of them.  I will go see it again if it shows any where near me or not.  It was wonderful and my face hurt from the constant grin I had on my face from the opening song.  It was so well put together that I could have won a Tony award for playing Tommy deVito.

Well, I was maybe 30 minutes into the movie when I just had to turn it off.  It was either that or gouge my eyes out and stick chop sticks in my ears.  It was so slow and lackluster.  Even JL Young who did win a Tony for his OBC performance as Frankie seemed to want to be some where else. No one seemed to be having any fun and that is simply wrong for JB.

6345101,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I had high hopes based on Clint Eastwood's prior works, but it felt too much like a direct literal adaptation from the play, for my taste.  Some devices that are necessary for the stage, like pretty much every character taking turns looking at the audience (camera) and providing first person narration, just don't translate to the screen for me.  I think it comes across as cheesy.  The story, itself, seemed more sanitized than the commercials for this film led me to believe, as well.  Again, I expect this of a stage production, but I expected more (apparently mistakenly) from a biopic.  If they were going to take it in this direction, they should have gone full-blown musical.  I still probably wouldn't have liked it (not a fan of most live action musicals) but the choices would have made more sense.",1420070400,,809,4.742857142857143

6345127,2,B00J9BZOXY,"This movie is good but not great.  Let me explain what I mean.

I virtually grew up with the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons.  Their music is a staple in the soundtrack of my life as well as many others.  The one thing that all of Frankie Valli's original recordings have in common is his rich toned voice and clear ringing soaring falsetto.

The actor that portrays Frankie Valli in this movie sounds clear and rich when he talks.  However, when you hear him sing, he butchers all of the songs he does.  His singing voice clearly indicates that he is nowhere as good as the legendary singer he portrays.  He sounds good in his natural vocal range.  When he goes up into his falsetto range, as he often does, he sounds terrible.

If you're a fan of the Four Seasons and want a little background info on the group, this movie gives you that.  However it mixes in a lot of bickering and brooding.  If you want to hear the classic sound of the Four Seasons don't buy this movie.",1420070400,3,987,4.304347826086956

6345170,3,B00J9BZOXY,"My review is based on the movie from Amazon's Instant Video format.  Great singing on the part of the actors but I deducted 1 star because of the stereo-only feed from Amazon's streaming Instant Video via the internet.  The sound could have been so much better so I'll have to consider either renting or buying a Blu-ray disk to hear the full capability of the audio track. After all, the singing and the sound is what this movie is really all about.  I'll rate this movie at 3 stars provided you play it through some decent speakers and not through the TV.  Otherwise you won't get the impact of how good the actors' singing really is in this movie.  I'll probably give it 4 stars if I hear it from a Blu Ray disk but that would be in a separate review.",1419984000,,754,4.28169014084507

6345187,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I bought the move and played it through twice. It was engaging because of the music. However, they might have actually done a better job at giving us some positive viewpoints about the individuals in this group. Don't know if it was the way the screenplay was written or no matter what the writers found out about these guys, it was depressing. There had to have been some decent characteristics about these men. I got really tired of hearing f*** like the word 'the'. It distracts the viewer from the point of conversation being told and dumbs everyone and everything down. Very shallow script. If the guys in the group were really like this? No wonder they fizzled out.",1419897600,5,671,4.647058823529412
6345188,5,B00J9BZOXY,The end crawl is worth the price of admission.  They had to be dancing in the aisles in the theaters.,1419897600,,101,4.05
6345189,2,B00J9BZOXY,"Seemed to focus more on their juvenile delinquency than their music. Also did not depict any of their stadium concerts and portrayed them as more of a bar band with their primary success as a lounge act in Vegas. Also, seemed to suggest they never got or had much air play! Not my kind of music anyway but my wife loved the Broadway musical and was disappointed in the movie too!",1419897600,,379,4.352112676056338
6345190,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I was looking forward to this but I think its probably better on Broadway than it is as  movie. John Lloyd Young was Frankie Valli on Broadway but his acting was more Michael Corleone than FV. Every time I heard him speak I could swear he was channeling Al Pacino, more mobster than singer. All in all it was pretty cheesy, you're better off just listening to the real FV sing on CD or streaming than listening to Young sing in the movie. Plus I couldn't tell if they were singing or if it was dubbed.

The truly bright note (no pun intended) is Christopher Walken, funny and great to watch. Still trying to figure out why Clint Eastwood made this, its definitely not a match made in heaven.",1419897600,,691,4.348837209302325

6345212,4,B00J9BZOXY,I rented this movie primarily for my wife to watch on a long plane ride.  I was intrigued by a Fresh Air interview with Bob Gaudio.  As it turned out I loved it as much as she did.  Clint Eastwood is still a great director and the movie captures a little bit of a stage feel without seeming like it's just a filming of a stage production.  I would very much recommend it to anyone who has even a slight liking of the style of music.,1419897600,,432,3.988372093023256

6345214,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I wasn't sure what to expect as I had not seen the Broadway show but I do LOVE the music.  I watched this movie the other night and loved it, absolutely loved it.  I'm not someone who cares for movies full of foul language and this movie did have an R rating due to the language BUT I will admit it wasn't that bad and what language was used was appropriately used in the movie.  The acting was great, the music ... what can I say... !!  The movie dragged for me a little tiny bit but it was due to story lines and they had to be told, that was obvious.  All in all, as I previously stated, I loved this movie.  I learned a lot, to the point of being surprised this group stayed together as long as they did.  Frankie Valli's life amazed me.  What he went through, what he did for his friends and group.  It was sad in places but again it was the story line.  Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job of directing.  His unique way of telling the story impressed me.  If you have NOT seen this movie, get it.  You WILL love it.  It is one I could watch again as there was so much it told I'm sure I missed some information.  The music alone is worth watching it over and over.",1419897600,,1169,4.0

You won't want to miss it!  I suspected it would be good knowing the Clint Eastwood directed it. And it was!
I also learned a few things about Frankie Valli that I didn't know before. He paid a Very High price for the cost of fame!  Makes your remember what is really important!!!",1419811200,,455,4.033333333333333

I have loved the Four Seasons music my entire life, but had never really delved into the story of the band.  It was both wonderful and heart wrenching to see how they became who they became.

6345494,3,B00J9BZOXY,"I have never seen the live musical, so my opinion will be a little slanted. The acting was pretty good and the sets were fun and colorful and captured the look and feel of the 60s. I especially liked Vincent Piazza and of course John Lloyd Young, who plays Frankie Valley and who I believe is the same actor as the Broadway version and he or they did all their own singing, so there is definitely talent involved.  I don't think I need to say that the singing and dancing were the most entertaining part about it. I found myself waiting for those scenes and getting bored during the non-musical scenes, especially toward the end of the movie. There is a really fun musical number at the end though that makes up for it. The songs are fun and familiar. I have a feeling I will like it live better. If you know nothing about it, its about Frankie Valley and the four Seasons. Im not sure how much Hollywood played with the history of it, so Look it up on Wikipedia.",1419206400,2,963,4.291208791208791

6345501,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey boys is the movie adaptation of the the story of the four men who came together to form the iconic '60s rock group The Four Seasons.

I didn't really know much about the story of the group, The Four Seasons, or much about the musical that the movie is based, but since this was directed by Clint Eastwood, I decided to watch.

Although the music is a little before my time, most of the songs I knew and found myself enjoying the soundtrack all the way through.  The story itself reminded me a bit of the fictional Eddie and the Cruisers movie from many years ago but with this being more based on the real lives of the band.  The story itself was very good and enjoyable and the acting superb in a lot of ways.  Some of the acting really stood out as superb especially Piazza as Tommy Devito, Young as Valli and Christopher Walken as Gyp DeCarlo.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected and was really good in a lot of aspects.

6345620,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I've seen both the movie version in the theater and the Broadway show.  Do yourself a favor and see the Broadway show (see it, feel it, breath it), and do not waste your time with the movie.  It's probably one of those instances where someone grew up with the Spiderman comics, then sees the movie as crap.  Same here I suppose.  I saw the Broadway show, then the movie was just a flop for me.  Yes, there's decent acting, but the movie just made me feel empty when I left.  I would compare the feelings of the difference between seeing a band in concert, then going home and listening to them on a studio cut CD.  My opinion of this movie would probably be 4 stars had I not had the Broadway show to compare.",1418774400,3,709,4.207407407407407

6345664,2,B00J9BZOXY,Another dark and dreary Clint Eastwood production. The film never mentions any other music being produced in the late 60's. The entire creation of a song is never shown. I never enjoy a film where the actors are talking to the viewers.,1418688000,,235,4.619047619047619

6345667,5,B00J9BZOXY,"There was NO Group more popular in the early 1960's than Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  This is the true behind the scenes story of their rise to fame, inspiration for the songs they wrote and sang and the tragedies some endured during those years.  Based on the Broadway Musical.  If you are an Oldies Music Aficionado, you will LOVE this movie.",1418688000,,352,4.555555555555555
6345668,2,B00J9BZOXY,"First off I saw the Broadway show in Las Vegas. I was not a Frankie Valli fan; however, I certainly knew the tunes. I have to say that the Broadway show is much superior to the movie. Clint Eastwood did a very poor job of directing. All of the emotional beats of the original show are missing. The pacing of this movie is extremely slow. The casting of the lead character is horrendous. This is always the problem in a movie about someone with an incredibly unique voice or talent. They are never going to sound as good as the person they are playing. However, I don't know who the lead singer was that I saw in Las Vegas, but he was 10 times the singer that they cast in the movie. I give the movie two stars because Christopher Walken is worth seeing and the sets and costumes are true to the period. Emotionally vacant directing by Clint Eastwood. This project could have been great. Poor casting, poor directing, bad singing... What a shame.",1418688000,,945,4.405714285714286
6345669,3,B00J9BZOXY,"It was good, but I watched the real Frankie Valli and the four seasons in person and listened to their music so maybe that is why I gave it a three.  I did not think he looked or acted like Frankie Valli.",1418601600,,204,3.857142857142857

Having grown up in those times I loved the music and it brought back many memories. It was great to see how talented the Four Seasons really were. The film was directed by Clint Eastwood and it is just a great film.  It was tightly directed and edited. It was interesting to see how their careers started and their involvement with the mob. Not all of the story was happy or easy for Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and that part of the story brings realism and drama to the story.

I really enjoyed the film and I recommend it to you. It is worth buying.",1418601600,,767,4.168918918918919

6345725,5,B00J9BZOXY,"My husband, our 14 yo daughter, and I watched this the other night and loved it. It's hard to find a movie that we all can enjoy and this one was it. My daughter loves musicals, but didn't want to see this when it came out at the theater because she had no clue who The Four Seasons were or what they sang. I know in her mind, it was just 'old music'. However, she loved this movie and as soon as it ended, was she was online finding all kinds of info about the songs, actors, Frankie Valli, etc.

Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't normally care for musicals, but since he knows the music in this one, and the singing takes place mostly when the band is actually on stage or recording, (not people randomly breaking into song, as in many musicals) he was okay with it.

I loved it and didn't realize I knew so many Frankie Valli songs. I was too young to be a fan of theirs in their heyday, and vaguely remember Frankie Valli as the guy who sang Grease. I guess a lot of the songs I'd heard and just never knew who sang them, but as they played in the movie, I found myself singing along under my breath and I knew all the words.

For those concerned, there are a few F bombs in this movie but they make sense in context. These guys had mob ties, after all--they weren't choir boys.",1418515200,4,1291,4.094861660079052

The movie was incredibly nostalgic. I probably enjoyed it more for that reason. It felt a bit too long. Valli's voice wobbled a few times. Although I think the actors did a good job, they were not as good as the original singers. It was done live though and I think that added an element of realism and texture. The story was entertaining though and I enjoyed it. They did a good job of bringing that subculture of 1960s New Jersey alive and making them all look like real people.

6345844,2,B00J9BZOXY,"Maybe if you're from Jersey you just want to ride the nostalgia wave here.

I'm not from Jersey, and that whole musical era was more like a couple generations before mine. The connection to actor Joe Pesci's real-life story is what drew me to JERSEY BOYS. Unfortunately, most of the writing and many scenes were bad to danged bad. The voice-over writing didn't help, but that's always a tough thing to do and not the actor's fault. Clint Eastwood's done some great films. This isn't one of them.

That said, it's a big messy challenge to get a watchable screen version of a musical, any musical. On the other hand, I really can't get enough of CADILLAC RECORDS, the film based on the real story of CHESS RECORDS, that brought Black Blues to the mainstream and integrated radio. So I'm a fan of music biographies. But probably not a fan of musicals translated to film. Except, maybe, ROCKY HORROR.

A friend told me to keep watching through the credits, though, and glad I did: the surreal Broadway style finale extended song and dance numbers that Christopher Walken joined in on were such a gleefully bizarre changeup, that three or four minutes of fun was a great relief to the preceding hour-plus of somebody else's nostalgia.",1418083200,,1229,4.706976744186046

6345877,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I really enjoyed this movie!!I usually like any movie from Clint Eastwood,this one was about a musical era a little before my time of favorites. Not that The Four Seasons weren't great hits,more of the british invasion era hits,but Franky Valli and crew had some great talent. They really kicked off the late 50's early 60's music era with great songs and great showmanship!
  I actually rented this film as a 60th birthday gift to myself and don't regret it at all! A great viewing experience!!The actors were unknown to me except for Christopher Walken(he's allways great),but from what I read in reviews they were in the stage play on broadway,at least some of them!!This kind of reminds me of Bobby Darin's biopic movie a few years ago where Kevin Spacey really nailed his story,another great movie and great tunes!!

The visuals of the movie are great, impressive, the directing by Clint Eastwood is superior.  Be sure and watch the extra video on the DVD disc in which they explain the final dance scene when the credits are rolling, and you get to see Eastwood dancing to the music also.",1417564800,,545,4.313725490196078

6346048,1,B00J9BZOXY,"As a fan of the Broadway production I was tremendously disappointed in this film.  When will Hollywood learn to not tinker with Broadway formulas?  Musical Theater is a very specific art form that should be respected when ushered to film and any potential director should have extensive musical theater experience.

As a Clint Eastwood devotee I regret to report that he totally missed the the boat with this film, making a series of very poor choices.  To begin with reduces the musical content to staged historical performances, perhaps to make the film more realistic.  Why?  Are we really interested in dramatic reality here, or is this a musical presentation structured around an mildly interesting biographical tale?  I mean this ain't LINCOLN for crying out loud.

The stage production updated all of the orchestrations, giving them greater energy and harmonic excitement.  Clint returns to the original arrangements, which now seem a bit flat.  The tempo and energy of the film is sort of EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE meets UNFORGIVEN and the script and acting are stilted and confused.  Nobody seems to get the jokes.  Oddly, Eastwood seems to have realized his mistakes and reverted to the original style for the final credits. Bizarre.

The bottom line is that every potential director charged with transitioning a Broadway musical to the screen should be required to view the films West Side Story, Little Shop of Horrors, Chicago and (even) The Sound of Music before beginning the work.  Skip this film and buy some tickets to a traveling stage production.  You'll love it.",1417392000,4,1583,5.0346153846153845

 squeal. This was bad casting, but for those of you who want to know more about him and his life you may find it interesting if you can

Despite being a Hollywood ""great"" , no one does bleak like Clint (Unforgiven, Million dollar Baby, etc. etc. ) Okay being an ""artiste"" these days, I'm sure he thinks he's doing tragic, but Clint old son you just do bleeding bleak. There is bleakness in the stage show, no denying it, but Clint latches onto that, amplifies it with his usually dreary visual style, elephantine sense of pace,and downplays everything else. Two stars for the great music, but even Clint manages to stuff that up sometimes  (On the stage show the first performance of Sherry sends shivers down your spine, not here though) Find it on a stage somewhere near you, and give that a try or just listen to the great music. Oh, and by the way, Clint seems to have lost any sense of humour he might have once had (not much to start with, I suspect).",1417305600,4,904,4.4397590361445785

First, when casting Frankie Valli, finding someone with the right voice was essential.  I felt that they found someone who had a similar tone but the actor's voice was generally annoying.  It was very distracting.

Secondly, the tone of the movie was uneven.  The attempts at comedy was too far and between and we were left with a dark tone for most of the movie.  We also could've used more Walken but thats simply due to the fact that you can never have enough Walken.

Overall, the lack of focus on the right vocal talent killed it for me.",1417219200,,681,4.435483870967742

If you enjoy this music and this time period you will enjoy this movie.  It is not a sordid biography and it does have to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time, which is probably why the critics did not embrace it.

While it's an extra expense to first rent the movie before buying it, it saves us $ in the long run. This is okay to see one time. Buy CDs of the 4 Seasons songs and enjoy them. Don't rent this movie because you think you'll get a big dose of music. In fact, if you really like Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons, I suggest not watching this movie at all. You don't really need to know all the sordid details of users, abusers, mobsters, criminals, thugs and cheats to enjoy the music.

I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but I don't really consider this one, though it's based on the Broadway version. To me, it was more of a Documentary of one of the great Musical Groups of the US. All the actors did a great job, and as usual, it's always a treat to watch Christopher Walken.

I love the 4 Seasons, in fact the first 45 record I ever bought was ""Rag Doll"".  The music in this movie is completely secondary to a depressing tale about Frankie Valli's failed marriage, failed relationships with daughters, failed relationships with band members, failed relationships with parents....  need I go on?

Saw the play at the Buell in Denver..terrific production.

6346301,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Jersey Boys is the show biz tale of how four kids came together to become The Four Seasons. The period is the 1950s. The setting: New Jersey. Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), leader of a group called the Variety Trio, is looking for a certain sound. He finds it in Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young). Frankie joins the group and a friend of his, Joe Pesci (Joseph Russo), introduces the group to his songwriting friend Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen). Soon, things begin to take off for the group. Frankie changes his name to Valli and the group adopts a new name The Four Seasons. As hit records, money, and fame roll in, internal conflicts escalate, creating rifts, jealousies, and perceived betrayals.

Director Clint Eastwood has made a fast-paced picture retaining most of the songs from the Broadway show and The Four Seasons catalogue  Sherry, Big Girls Dont Cry, Walk Like a Man, Dawn, Rag Doll, and more. Young recreates the role he introduced on Broadway and is excellent, but its Piazza who etches the most memorable portrayal. As the tough-talking, intimidating, petulant Tommy DeVito, he provides the film with its dramatic core. The always-welcome Christopher Walken appears as local mobster Gyp DeCarlo, whose business becomes entwined with The Four Seasons career.

The film fascinates as both period piece and edgy musical biography. The finale  a high-spirited footnote to the Golden Age of rock n roll that functions as a sort of elaborate curtain call is the invention of Mr. Eastwood. Filmed entirely on the studio back lot, it allows the cast to appear in costume but slightly out of character to sing their way out.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include featurettes on adapting Jersey Boys from Broadway to the big screen, Christopher Walkens character, and a behind-the-scenes look at the preparation for the Oh, What a Night finale. There is also a digital HD copy.",1416787200,2,1901,4.9842271293375395

One of my favorite parts is the ""Bollywood-type"" ending where the whole cast comes out and sings and dances at the end of the movie.  It was the cherry on top.

6346321,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I remember riding down the Sunrise Highway crunched between my mother and father in the front seat as Rag Doll was playing. I was singing along until Frankie Valli hit those high notes wishing I could too. Time moved on with the Four Seasons banging out one hit after the other, then it was quiet for a while until Frankie Valli went solo. Most of my Italian relatives were still alive and opinions abounded sitting around the dining room table at dinnertime. Everyone talked like they knew something, but what I learned from Jersey Boys is what they might not have known.

Being a kid an adult would never had mentioned anything about the Mafia although there may have been hints figuring I wouldn't understand. There weren't any. What I like best about this film is that it filled in a lot of blanks for me, gave me some sight as to what people could have been going through, the stuff that didn't get publicized. I now have a complete picture. I like complete pictures.

Jersey Boys took me back to a time people had integrity, A.M. radio played good music, the world was practical and idealistic, and although there was underlying darkness it was balanced out by light.

Better than a time machine I felt my hand was being held as I walked through memory lane.

Quite a lot more criminality and rough language in the movie than in the play,  however this seemed to be true to the actual happenings which allowed the Four Seasons to get started and be successful.  Lead player  (Frankie Valli) voice seemed to be more piercing than either Frankie Valli was,  or Travis Cloer who played Frankie Valli in Las Vegas was.  Once I got by that,  he had a very  good voice and played the role very well.  Overall very enjoyable.

""Jersey Boys"" is not a great film outside its musical moments; but there's no denying the powerful pleasure of the music...and the great nostalgia fix for those of us who were coming of age in the early to middle 60s when the Four Seasons first burst on the scene. Maybe not a great film, but certainly a very good one and it did not deserve to be panned as it was by some critics...Eastwood-haters, I'd guess. Adapted from a highly successful stageplay, Eastwood kept the same premise by letting each member of the group tell their story...you know there is each person's perception and then there's the real story. The casting is outstanding and John Lloyd Young's singing voice is as close a match to Frankie Valli's as any I've ever heard. Vincent Piazza, as Tommy DeVito; Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi; and Erich Bergen, as Bob Gaudio, are also great vocalists and musicians...the group sounds like the Four Seasons I remember. Most of the actors will not be familiar to you...except for Christopher Walken, who plays the mob boss, Gyp DeCarlo...yes, individual members of, the Seasons (Valli and DeVito in particular) had some involvement with organized crime figures, just as Sinatra did before them. But bottom line, if you can watch this film without tapping your feet or outright dancing, you may need to schedule a physical. I have it in my collection for frequent viewing! -",1416528000,2,1519,4.779467680608365

6346537,5,B00J9BZOXY,"If you liked the Four Seasons music or even if you're not sure about it, read ALL the reviews for this movie--not just those negative ones.  That will give you a better idea about the real merits of JERSEY BOYS.

I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and liked it a lot. I pre-ordered the Blu-ray disk and waited impatiently until it was released, and WOW! I liked it even more when I saw it again.

I don't really 'get' why there are all those attacks on Clint Eastwood or why some so-called reviewers jumped on the stage actors and bad-mouthed their performances. That's just rubbish. This film is vibrant, exciting, funny, sad in places, and gives you such an upbeat feeling after you've heard all that fabulous music! John Lloyd Young is a marvel as Frankie Valli, and I think the whole cast was terrific! My only criticism is very slight--I didn't like the bridge in the music in the middle of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You."" It was so different from what was in all those online videos from the many versions of the stage productions (which will really psych you up for seeing this film if you watch them). But that's such a trivial point in the overall picture.

So I hope you give this great movie a chance and be fair by reading all the positive things other reviewers on here have said. That 'curtain call' at the end of the film with the music continuing through the ending credits will leave you pretty jubilant and buzzed by the sheer joy of ""Oh, What a Night."" It left me saying to myself, ""Oh, What a Movie!""",1416355200,2,1532,4.364912280701755

6346550,1,B00J9BZOXY,"I just rented this movie and had to, just had to, express my opinion somehow.  This is terrible. The music is flat. With all the money Clint must have to spend, couldn't he have found singers who could sing like the Four Seasons and not at least two octaves flatter and lower? Not only is the music flat, the characters are flat, the story is flat. Come on! Clint, you could have done so much more with these characters and with this story. I have nothing good to say. Even the ""place"" doesn't ring true to the 50s. It's so trite and not true. Well, clearly I'm disappointed. This feels like someone who has gotten over confident. Maybe he had an intern do it. I'd love to have my four ninety nine back from ITunes. I never do this, but I just had to say something. I wish I could think of something good to say. Nice idea.

6346563,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Definitely a film in Eastwood's style, ""Jersey Boys"" is a fun movie to watch, and while I cannot judge the source work (the aforementioned stage musical) in comparison to this film, it seems a classy act in itself. While the film is narrated by Vincent Piazza (playing Tommy DeVito), the film's point of focus is the personal life and career of Frankie Valli (portrayed amiably by John Lloyd Young) and this is a none-too-flattering portrayal of the man. However, the script itself is not vindictive at all; if you enjoy listening to oldies and you like the sound of the Four Seasons, you will enjoy this. At first, I was a bit worried about Young when he started to soar up into those soprano female registers that the real Frankie ascended to with graceful ease, but actually he does a pretty strong job on the vocals, even though it is clearly the case of him trying to make the songs his own rather than trying to parody Frankie (which is probably a good thing). As with all film biopics, this film skips too many lengthy periods and attempts to squeeze the universe into a ball without making it bleed; nonetheless, what remains is enjoyable, but do not go into the film expecting anything groundbreaking. I believe this film's cool critical reception has something to do with the fact that this is not typical Eastwood action and/or drama, but the man enjoys music too, and is an accomplished musician himself. Other actors do a fine job with the material, and cinematographer Tom Stern gets it right in capturing the period detail. The one negative thing is that there is too much biography/story for my taste and not enough bombastic musical numbers; for example, the film only really catches fire in the closing ""Oh What a Night"", and the ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" number is filmed a bit too often in close-up (not really to my taste). As a plus, the closing credits have a couple of the Four Seasons's best original numbers playing, and for my money ""Rag Doll"" was one of their best songs ever, so appropriately it closes the film's credits proper, reminding one of how astoundingly high that Valli's vocals are on that track.
As for the DVD, the picture and sound are pristine, and there is a brief extra feature included that shows how the final dance number was choreographed.
""Jersey Boys"" is rated R, and there are a great many f-words flying about, but really if you are not offended by that word then there is no reason that you can't watch this one with the family. There is nothing else objectionable about it. B-",1416182400,2,2535,4.623059866962306

6346565,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Way better than I thought it would be and I thought it would be pretty good.  I always loved the Four Seasons because they had their own sound in a world of Motown vs. Elvis.  Then, the California sound came along...thank God for the Beatles, but the Four Seasons always stayed true to their own sound.  If for no other reason, the soundtrack alone is worth the price.

Honestly, you have to wait through 55 minutes of film before the musical numbers start really rolling.  This movie should soar with some of the most engaging pop melodies of the 50's and 60's. Instead its enjoyable but its a wanna be gangster movie with music.  For me it didn't work but I admire the stellar cast and Clint Eastwood is an exceptional director... of non-musicals.

If they have made it an hour and half, instead of 2 hours 15 minutes, it probably would have worked out really well. The singing is fantastic and well done to Clint Eastwood for using real singers (unlike those dreadful movie versions of Mamma Mia, Phantom and Les Mis), but there is way too many slow periods between songs dragging out the story. Those who've seen the show will know it is non-stops songs, with short bursts of dialog in between.

Going in, I knew almost nothing about the Four Seasons as people.  I still don't.

The film seemed very disjointed.  Other characters came and went, often with lightning speed and without explanation or meaningful reason for their being included. For example, the depiction of Frankie Valli's outside love interest.  She popped into the film, there was a subsequent shot of the two of them getting out of bed, another brief scene or two and last, she was packing her bags.  Why was this character included?  Was she important? Did she impact the story or character? Not that I could see based on what was presented.  Usually Clint Eastwood is such an insightful director.  I am so surprised.

However, these are not my biggest complaints.

What I did not see - until the last 15 minutes of the film - was any type of joy.  No joy in the music, no joy in singing together, no joy in performing.  In fact, the Frankie Valli actor largely looked in pain during most of the performance parts of the film.  There were flickers of some joy in what they were doing during the early part of the film, but precious little of that.

What saved this film from being a complete disappointment was the last 15 minutes.  From the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction through ""Oh, What A Night"" segment, THAT was the film.  In those minutes, I was presented with fuller character studies than I was given during the rest of the film.  Not only that, I saw that joy - the joy those people HAD to have possessed.  Otherwise they'd have been good for one hit and that was it.

I buy at lot of movies and can watch many of them again and again.  Alas, this one is likely destined for a one-watch only.  It just doesn't deliver for me.",1415923200,9,2033,4.471389645776567
6346645,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Once upon a time in the early 1950's there was an all male singing group known as ""The Four Lovers."" Singing and recording under more than a dozen different names in those early years, the group eventually settled on the name of a bowling alley/cocktail lounge they had just been ousted from: ""The Four Seasons.""  After a performing as a backing group on recordings of other artists with the help, and under the tutelage of Bob Crewe, the group finally had it's first certified mega hit in 1962 with ""Sherry,"" a song written by Bob Gaudio, the group's newest member. It is not mentioned in the film but while shopping for a label that would record and market ""Sherry"" it was the great Vee-Jay label which finally said ""Yes"" to recording the song! The Four Seasons were the first non-black group ever to record on that label and that, in and of itself, was a significant event in the early days of Rock 'N Roll.  It would not be the only omission of important events not being included at all or given very short shrift. From ""Sherry"" onward, it seemed the group could do no wrong and they churned out hit after hit with 99% of the songs written by the great Bob Gaudio along with Bob Crewe's help and production acumen and all were arranged, mostly, by Nick Massi.  The group was so popular and so much a part of the current music scene it withstood the British Invasion, including that of The Beatles, and it was only when Rock turned to a harder edge, did the group's popularity begin to wane. Again, this is not alluded to in the film. The group was still busy doing concerts and live appearances for many years but we really would like to know what happened to them as
performers & friends before and after their final split as well!

I bought this film on one recommendation only and that came from someone who had seen the Broadway production.  I loved and still love Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons.  Was it worth buying, I asked my friend?  ""Yes, I loved it!"" came the reply.  Having very similar, almost identical tastes in film and music, I pre-ordered the film!  As I sit here today I can only tell you that now, having seen the film three times, this is one of the least satisfying musical bio-pics I have ever seen in my lifetime and I have seen them all!  It is not an altogether bad film but it is not the great film it should or could have been either!  I cannot point to only one thing that was lacking.  From the writing, to the production, to the choice of performers to the direction...it was borderline good/not so good or it simply failed in too many areas.  There was no story line and no plot to speak of.  It is similar to a musical hit compilation that contains many well known titles but has neglected others or put them into a medley format. These compilations include most of the important songs and they feature sundry liner notes and still photographs as a bonus.  I didn't want liner notes.  I wanted a story. I don't think I was expecting much more than a bio-pic which would focus its attention on both Frankie Valli as well as the very special relationship he shares with the multifaceted and all important figure of Bob Gaudio, along with the salient information on the other group members along with their significant contributions to the overall group but little to none of it was included. I know little more about Frankie Valli now than I ever did except that at one time he spelled his last name with a ""Y"" and he has or had, three daughters.  At least we must assume it is three since, in one scene, we find him saying good-bye to three teenage girls along with his wise-cracking wife who has turned into the worlds worst drunken shrew!  We also don't ever get to know if Valli ever moved himself and his family to finer digs!  The one scene we are allowed to view has him going home to a middle class neighborhood and living in a two family house featuring side by side apartment entrances on a very unassuming and small piece of local property. Whatever and whomever Bob Gaudio was involved with or where he came from before he met up with the group, we will never know for that information is also not contained in this film! All we really know is that he was not from the neighborhood, co-wrote ""Short-Shorts"" and pulled ""Sherry"" from a magical top hat and joined The Four Lovers who became The Four Seasons!  The personal trials and tribulations of the group are not in evidence here outside of various and sundry pieces concerning the life of Frankie Valli.  How any of their lives really must have benefited or suffered is not a part of the film either!

Fast forward about 45 years and they are now known to the theater going world as ""Jersey Boys"" and are filling the seats in a Broadway production of their life story.  Add to that a couple of national tours as well as other production iterations and we come to this moment...the film version. I really don't wish to pan this film and I've never seen the play.  Perhaps it did follow along those lines, BUT, Eastwood might have taken a bit of liberty in adding information and filling in some glaring blanks.  Perhaps he saw the play's overwhelming popularity as a testament to it's worthiness as a complete film.  I don't know the answers to these things nor should I have to.  I only know that I wanted to know more than I saw contained in this film! BUT....to the portrayals:  John Lloyd Young portrays Frankie Valli ,whose voice gave the group its memorable stamina and driving sound, Erich Bergen is Bob Gaudio, the group's keyboard player and prolific composer of it's most iconic songs, Michael Lomenda is Nick Massi, the group's bass singer and player and Vincent Piazza plays Tommy DeVito, the group's lead guitarist as well as the low-life jailbird, mob connected, neighborhood thug and one of the founding members of the original group before Valli joined it. Piazza gives a stand-out performance as the street thug turned musician complete with Jersey tough guy look and accent who wants a better life but just cannot bring himself to eschew his behavior, ties to the underworld and all of life's darker temptations. John Lloyd Young has a great set of falsetto pipes for the role but his facial expressions are, at times, painful to watch and with his rather stocky appearance, doesn't really look the part! He seems a bit dopey at times!  Michael Lomenda gives Nick Massi just the right feel and light handed touch and Erich Bergen looks every bit the studious and well bred white guy from the right side of the tracks who breathed life into what was to become the most influential group of the 1960's and '70's with his unique and compelling musical  compositions.  Special mention must go to Mike Doyle for his portrayal of Bob Crewe, the other half of the group's composing team and the man who first gave them their real start in the recording studio and who stayed with them through it all, producing their great catalog of music. He plays it with a special 'Gay' flair which was borderline flamboyant for the times but totally acceptable in all...plus he is as charming and good looking as he can be! Christopher Walken plays Gyp DeCarlo, the underworld mobster involved with DeVito and subsequently, with the group as well as with Frankie, ongoing!  Walken has yet another chance to be a weird actor in a feature film and he doesn't miss a beat!  Another highlight was Renee Marino, in her screen debut, who played Mary Delgado Valli, Frankie's first wife.  Her time on-screen was not at all lengthy, but very important to the film and she played it very, very well.  I'll be watching for her name in the future.

The direction was borderline good/bad, depending on your point of view and point of reference... and that is being kind.  Mr. Eastwood may understand music and even write light Jazz compositions but if you've ever seen his video interview with Tony Bennett, the lack of interesting insight and entertainment value is evident from the start. Eastwood has directed and produced some fine films...but sadly, this is not one of them. He may be better off in the direction of dramatic film and I would actually beg him to stay there. The closing sequence is one of the most memorable of the film and even though it smacks of a bit of Broadway, or even ""Bollywood,"" it is an exciting musical number added to re-introduce the players and those involved in the overall  production!  Perhaps the entire film should have been fully adapted from the play, but just in case it was, perhaps told as a story just the way ""Grease"" was...complete with bookends holding it from its ""Once Upon A Time"" to its ""The End"" with much more information between those two things than was seen here!  Oh, and by the way MISTER Eastwood... I just loved the ""Rawhide"" clip being shown on TV in that one scene!  Can you credit yourself with an appearance for that?  OK,OK...Hey,I was just asking!  You never know...it may help to extend your acting credits well into their seventh decade.  Hmmmm...I wonder?!?!

So, in the final analysis the question still remains: ""What is it that keeps audiences coming back time after time to the ""Jersey Boys"" no matter where it is being presented and in whatever format it is shown?  My answer is, it's the music!  Yes, it certainly is that along with an opportunity to reconnect with a much brighter and more hopeful time in all our lives.  It was the music that had us enrapt and continues to keep us tied into the joy of being alive in a changing world during the most famous and infamous time in music history. That would be Rock 'N Roll and for the boys from Jersey, one could say that now, it's Rock 'N Roll, forever!",1415923200,6,9671,4.556581986143187

6346657,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I waited for this movie to come out, I was/am a fan of the Four Seasons, it was disappointing, very disappointing.

I think Clint Eastwood got so caught up in the story telling that he forgot it was supposed to be a musical. The horns were out of sync, the female act was painful. I understand this was a play but I can not imagine people really liking the music.

Look Frankie Valli has a voice that you can't reproduce so why even try, they should have used Frankie's voice and had the actor lip sync to it. Oh gosh the actors voice was so nasal that it was painful and it never got better. I kept thinking so they are going to tell us Frankie took singing lessons but no, fact is the dude playing Frankie (not bothering to look up his name) sounded like he had a cold.

The acting was OK, the story line was OK - the part about Tommy ripping the group off and the part about his daughter actually made me care other wise it would have been a total write off. There is one good thing to come out of this, I bothered to look up  Bob Guido - what a amazing career.

When they aged the characters - never on Frankie Valli's worse day did he look that bad. In short, bad music, bad make up, and just OK acting.",1415923200,,1208,4.0588235294117645

6346670,2,B00J9BZOXY,"I have read several reviews on here, weighed both the pros (and there PLENTY of them) and the cons, and this is what I thought about ""Jersey Boys.""  To me, the movie never had a true focus, and it is easy to tell Clint Eastwood has no business trying to direct a ""musical,"" albeit, a lame one.

Supposedly, this is the tale of the Four Seasons (later to become Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons).  It covers the beginning of the group formation to its demise.  The viewer is treated to flashbacks and flash-forwards, pivotal scenes are never explained, e.g. when the group confronts Tommy about the $500 grand he has stolen from the group PLUS his own $150 grand debt to the mob, we see Frankie Valli tell the mob's ""collector,"" that he will repay every cent.  Why?  I have had some very special friends in my lifetime, but I can honestly say that if I ever caught you stealing from me and could confront you face-to-face, you'd better hope you can get out of the room before I get my hands on something.  The relationship between Valli and his wife is hardly touched on, nor was the death of one of his daughters.

Another aspect of this movie that bothered me was the singing because, ladies and germs, the guy who played Valli was NOT Frankie Valli.  His voice was, at best, tepid.  If you are cast to play a singer with a falsetto to die for (and you decide you're going to do your own singing), you'd better be able to pull it off.  The other guy in the group (I think maybe the bass singer), could not carry a tune in a bucket.

I had heard nothing but raves about the Broadway production of this show, but was never able to see it.  Basically (for me), this just didn't translate very well from stage to screen.  The movie is rated R for language and sexual situations and is about 15 minutes too long.",1415923200,,1810,4.332344213649852

There were several previews in the beginning and having paid for the video I don't think one should have to put up with these.  The voice of Frankie in the movie was terrible and did not sound at all like Frankie.  The film did not fill up the TV screen.

For us it was two out of three."" Tommy Devito (Piazza) is putting a band together and trying to make it big. Nothing really clicks until Frankie (Young) joins the group. His distinct singing gives the group a push but when songwriter Bob Gaudio shows up the group explodes. Things are turning out the way they all wanted until Tommy's demons catch up with all of them. This is the true story of the rise and fall of the Four Seasons. First thing I have to say about this movie is that I was a little disappointed. I am not a big Frankie Valli fan but I do love true stories and music. The big problem with this to me was the pacing. The first hour seems like back story and they struggle to get a record deal. Then 20 minutes of hit after hit come at you, then another hour of the group falling apart. I was mainly looking forward to the music and that part seemed to be glossed over. All that said though the actors were perfect. Every person in here (except Devito and Christopher Walken) has been in the stage production on and off Broadway and that really added to the movie. You really believe they are the real people and the movie does come off almost like a stage play. The biggest problem again though is that is seemed to drag on and I was losing interest a few times. Overall, fans of Broadway musicals or the Four Seasons may really enjoy this but as for me it was a bit of a struggle to finish. I give this a B-.",1415577600,,1588,4.159090909090909

I did enjoyed the early parts of the movie that defined the characters young adult hood.  As well as the Brill Bldg efforts to become discovered, but that's about all.

I felt like I was watching a something less then a musical production and more like an effort of understudies trying to cover for the real actors, musicians, the director and staff.  Even the technical support efforts such as the actors facial makeup, for example the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame segment seemed unprofessional.

My comments should not be taken as a put down of the 4 Seasons or their music.  I grew up listening to their music as a northern New Jersey teenager.  This movie, not the 4 Seasons, was just a poor and inappropriate reproduction of those times and the Broadway Musical.

Finally, Clint Eastwoods Bollywood ending was completely stupid.  Maybe he should keep to his true senior citizen skills of entertaining  us by talking to empty chairs on stage - and stay away form Directing remakes of classic Broadway musicals.",1414108800,3,1140,4.8

In he musical there are songs that the four seasons did not write or even perform! Those were still in the movie which was funny as the elevator type transition in the record studio portrayed and overall the movie was well done. If anyone paid any attention to what happened in the musical, Francine's conflicts and death were in he musical! The mob ties were in the musical! Everyone is expecting this to be just like the musical but in reality this is a movie production based off of the musical. Frankie Valli is one of the most gifted performers out there and the Jersey Boys are my favorite singing group of all time! This was a great movie that I hope will expose others to their story and possibly see the musical in the future.
You cannot like one and hate the other. Both must be appreciated, so know what you are actually watching and probably going to expect! Though in the actually movie the singing was not blended well enough, Frankie was flat at moments or even way too sharp. It was just off musically, but decent in a way where they were singing throughout the plot line and so forth So all in all, it's a great movie worth watching!

6346820,5,B00J9BZOXY,"Having been involved in the record business in the mid 60's; having seen the 4 Seasons perform live in the mid 60's in Philadelphia; and also having seen the show on Broadway, it was with great anticipation to see how this show would be handled on the large screen. Eastwood is a master craftsman as his many accolades and awards demonstrate. I loved seeing them live in concert, and i really enjoyed seeing Jersey Boys on Broadway too.
I absolutely loved the movie and how the characters were developed and brought to life on the big screen in a way which could not be done on stage. I thought that the movie was actually superior to the Broadway show as it delved into the individual group members while also introducing much of the audience to the inner workings of the music industry at that time.
Retrospectively I feel that the Broadway show was little more than seeing a ""Tribute Band"" of the 4 Seasons, in contrast to the movie which actually brought the viewer up close and drew them into the story.  I Salute Clint Eastwood for another fantastic job.
Although my particular expertise was in the area of recording sound mixer and production, i cannot comment on the sound quality of the motion picture as the exhibitor chose to present this movie in a non Dolby Digital auditorium which was my only disappointment. (not a disappointment with the movie, but with the theater).

6346826,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Eastwood once again has given to us a slice of American history. This time it is in Music, rock 'n' roll.  The film would have ganered 5 stars if it's director decided to include two very important facts about the Four Seasons.  Frankie Valli was not the younget in the film. Eastwood has given you the impression that he was the youngest and his age was about 20. Valli, however was born n 1934,
making him 28 when their first it, Sherry, hit the charts in 1962. Another source list his birthday as 1937, thus making him 15. Second, for a majority of his career, Valli was almost deaf in one ear. It subsequently was operated on and he was restored with normal hearing. Despite these issues, the remainder of the fllm showcases the great career of the Four Seasons and their influence on American pop music. Besides the Beach Boys, the Four Seasons were the most popular group on the music scene. Gtreat production coupled with great musical support. A few hits were omited, most noticeably, Silver Star and Rhapsody (their last charted song). I suggest that you still go and see this film despite the few flaws. When we saw the movie on the first day of isduance,the average age of the audience was over 50. Hopefully all ages will get the oppirtunity to see one of the greatest musical acts not just of the 60's, but of American music. The movie simply transporrts you to the early 60's and keeps you entertained for over two hours. Great job and kudos to Mr. Eastwood. The screen projects one great performance after another. Outstanding entertinment.",1405900800,14,1555,4.630434782608695
6346827,2,B00J9BZOXY,"What do you call a movie that's based on a smash Broadway musical--and half the songs have been thrown out?
A Clint Eastwood movie.
Eastwood is an Academy Award winning director--whose made brilliant character studies in such gems as ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino."" His best work features characters that are flawed, oft times tortured.
So when I read that he was in charge of ""Jersey Boys,"" a wildly popular, Emmy-winning stage musical that's been lauded both in big American cities and in travelng companies around the world, I thought; well, at least this will be interesting.
Brave is the movie maker who takes on a project that's loaded with infectious pop tunes from the sixties since this production is all about how Frankie Valli and the  Four Seasons rose to international fame with such toe-tapping tunes as ""Walk Like a Man,"" ""Rag Doll,"" ""Sherry.""
For every movie musical that turned into box bonanzas like the wonderful, 'The Sound of Music,"" and ""Mama Mia,"" you've got mega-bombs like ""Phantom of the Opera,' ""Les Miserables"" and especially the ghastly ""The Producers"" and the truly hideous, ""Rent.""
Eastwood photographs ""Jersey Boys"" in a dim, washed-out style, not a very promising ingredient for a fun and fascinating musical bio of a singing team. There's no color to be seen. Everything is dark brown, black, shadowy so it suggests we're watching a grim dramatic story of stunted personalities.
None of the cast members seem to be having a good time. There's nothing joyous or witty about them. When the group finally performs one of their hit tunes, one singer breaks the fourth wall of narrative to speak directly to the camera to explain some plot element that only adds nothing to our boredom. You can't enjoy the musical number because you're trying to understand what the actor is saying to us.
The story begins as we watch the evolution of the Jersey Boys from stealing safes, crashing cars and going to prison--as if they were going to a high school dance. Then we watch them begin to meet the shady characters of the underworld, with one of the singers dealing with drugs.
We watch the boys finally connect but even here, we are short-changed any delightful vocalizing. We watch them rehearse in a casual manner. AS the minutes drag on, we realize that there is no music. Eastwood is determined to pack on the backstory and character development.
The result is a boring retread of every tough-boy-grows-up-on-the mean streets, from James Cagney in ""Public Enemy"" in 1931 through ""Mean Streets,"" ""Good Fellas"" and ""The Godfather."" We've seen this all so many times and in so many incarnations on both movies and TV that we know exactly what to expect. You certainly don't expect to see this blandness in a supposedly joyful musical.
We then spend more, long minutes as Frankie Valli marries a beautiful, feisty Italian girl but later in the movie we abruptly encounter her again and she's become a shrieking, drunken shrew and resembles some reject from the Real Housewives of New Jersey.
Well, we think, at least that's over, and now maybe some music. But wait--we now have Valli's daughter running away from home and being tracked down in NYC and we discover she feels rejected by her famous parent and she wants a musical career of her own. This very long sequence goes nowhere. The daughter makes this sudden appearance out of nowhere and then vanishes from the story.
Whew, thank the Lord, that's over with. But then comes a rather hysterical episode where our aging singers are now inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Since they're now aging crooners, they're padded and bulky and walk real slow and wear wigs that you'd find in a Halloween Costume shop.
And then, at the end, it's like someone's nudged Eastwood and reminds him that this is a musical so we have the entire cast suddenly appear and dance maniacally and grinning and freeze now and the to the tune of ""Oh, What a Night!""
This sudden musical number shocks--because this is what the audience has been waiting for for the past two hours.
Let's be grateful Eastwood doesn't get his hands on a remake of the masterpiece, ""The Sound of Music."" We'd probably be seeing Julie Andrew swirling around on a hilltop, machine gun in hand, while singing: ""Du Hills Are Alife--with du sound of mu-zak!""",1405814400,3,4319,4.828609986504723

6346832,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Lets face it. There are two groups of fans who will go and see Jersey Boys, the new film based on the hit play. Clint Eastwood has a long and storied career as both a star and a director and has built a large, devoted fan-base. The other group are fans of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, the subject of the extremely popular stage play upon which this movie is based. Neither group is the type known for running out to the theater on opening weekend (i.e. adults over 40) and snapping up a handful of tickets, leading to box office success. A teenage boy wouldnt be caught anywhere near a theater showing this film. And teenaged boys, sadly, control the box office.

Jersey Boys isn't one of Eastwoods best. I have never seen the play, but I would guess this is a pretty faithful adaptation, down to the final dance number featuring the entire cast as the sort of final curtain call you would see on stage. Its difficult to pin down, but I get the feeling Eastwood didn't put his full energy into the project. Everything seems a little rote and routine, like he is following a well-read playbook and simply painting by numbers, following the source material too closely. I understand this is a very popular play and it is based on the real-life story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. But there are certain things that work better in a play and shouldnt be carried over to the big-screen adaptation.

One of the things that should have been changed? The characters each break the Fourth Wall, the wall between the stage, actors and scenery and the audience. This imaginary structure allows the audience to look in and observe the story. When a play or movie has done a good job, we feel as though we are eavesdropping and could reach out and touch Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts.

Breaking the wall happens more frequently in stage plays, when a character will turn to and directly address the audience, giving them a bit of narrative to act as punctuation or keep the story moving. This same technique is rarely used in film; the whole point of going to a movie is to become a part of the characters lives, to take a journey with them. When any character breaks the fourth wall, they are drawing us out of that cocoon, making us an observer of actors playing roles, rather than letting us become a part of the narrative. In Jersey Boys, each of the four main characters turns to the camera and addresses us, giving us little insights into their characters or their band mates. Ultimately, this almost becomes the same thing most people complain about musicals in the first place. Most people who don't like musicals don't like characters breaking into song and dance in the middle of a conversation or kiss or argument. It draws them out of the story. And this is exactly what the characters addressing us does. Breaking the Fourth Wall makes us aware that we are watching a film. Once that happens, it takes a while for viewers to lose themselves in the narrative again, if they are able to do that at all.

The story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is told in an unremarkable linear fashion, giving us the highlights of the lives and careers of each of the musicians. What is missing are the details. And, frankly, if you have seen any other biopic about a musician, nothing in this story will seem particularly unique. The band members have financial problems, they have creative disagreements, they make deals with others, they have fights over the direction their band should take, they have problems with their wives, they have problems with their kids. Because everything is so familiar, you might hope that Jersey Boys would have a depth of detail that would help set it apart. At one point, just as they are about to become successful, Frankie eyes an older woman, Mary (Renee Marino) and decides to hit on her. She delivers the best line in the movie. Call your mother, you're going to be home late. Next thing we know, they are married. Later, Frankie returns home and is fighting with Mary, apparently they have broken up. Their daughters sit on the stairwell, upset to hear their parents arguing. When did things go so wrong? When did they have kids? But we don't get any of the details about why. This moment only serves as a plot point for a further development that is even more tenuous and doesnt really get the attention it should.

Here I am arguing that we don't have enough details about a story that we can already recite from memory. This reminds me of the line from Annie Hall. Theres an old joke um two elderly women are at a Catskill resort, and one of em says, Boy, the food at this place is really terrible. The other one says Yeah, I know; and such small portions.

Another reason I believe Eastwood didn't have his heart in the film? Everything seems dull and poorly lit. This is clearly an artistic (or financial?) decision made by the filmmakers. I suspect it was a creative decision, to mimic the look of a musical from the 50s. But it doesnt work. An American in Paris, Singin In the Rain and other iconic musicals of this era are known for their bright, vibrant colors, showing everything in vivid detail. In Jersey Boys, everything seems like it is shot through a black and white filter, darkening and dulling the images. There are many movie theaters that don't change their projection bulbs enough, resulting in the same sort of feel for most films they show. Ive never experienced this at this theater, so I suspect it was a creative decision. So it seems odd that there was a conscious choice to give this story this look. It simply ends up looking amateurish.

Eastwood is known as a director who knows what he wants and gets the job done, usually under budget. In fact, there was a story floating around the internet about how the four actors playing the leads in this film appreciated him for his economical filmmaking, i.e., fewer takes. I wonder if this desire to make the film quickly and under budget caused the dull, grainy look of the film. If so, it was bad decision because it just makes the film look cheap.

The actors aren't served by the Cliff Notes-like nature of the screenplay. John Lloyd Young, a relative newcomer, plays Frankie Valli. Initially, he shows us the confusion and the wonder Valli experiences navigating the treacherous waters of the music industry. But later, all of a sudden, Frankie is a hardened businessman, ready and willing to make difficult decisions for the sake of the band and for his band members. Tommy DeVito, played by Vincent Piazza, is the man who initially shepherds Frankie through the music business, but as their popularity grows, it becomes clear that he doesnt have the vision to take them to the next level. Being pushed to the side seems to accelerate other problems Tommy has, leading to a big confrontation down the line. Michael Lomenda, also a relative newcomer, plays Nick Massi, the other original member of the band also coaching Frankie through the beginning, formative years, steering him from a life of crime to a life of music. His character is given the least amount of screen time and seems to be the least interesting. The last member of the group, Bob Gaudio, played by Erich Bergen (a number of television credits), joins them when they try out one of his songs. He and a co-writer go on to write most of the hits the band is known for. Gaudio is also the most familiar with the inner workings of the music industry and Frankie recognizes this, prompting Valli and Gaudio to form a side partnership of their own.

After Valli experiences a traumatic event, the story suddenly shifts to the 90s, to the bands induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, reuniting the aging members of the band for one last live performance. It is a nice moment, but you get the feeling that so much was cut out, to make the film an acceptable length.

The music? Its great and fun to hear again. But only one of the songs is given any real context. Another, we see the moment of inspiration, but beyond that all of the great songs seem to simply materialize out of thin air. Maybe this was the case, but most art is inspired by something, so it seems unlikely.

Jersey Boys is okay, particularly when the music becomes a part of the narrative. But the highlights-only nature of the narrative and the grainy, dark look of the film serve to make the film seem amateurish and underwhelming.",1405468800,2,8398,4.580838323353293

The film at times fells like a ""greatest hits"" album as it shows the difficult relationships within the band and with elements of the mob.  Band member Tommy Devito (Vincent Piazza) became the antagonist in the film while Bob Guadio (Erich Bergen) was the song writer who tailored his songs for Frankie.

6346837,3,B00J9BZOXY,"First off, I have to admit to not being a huge fan of the Broadway show.  I didn't care then about Frankie Valli's life and I still don't now.  What the show had going for it, though, was tremendous energy and a glitzy, somewhat cheesy charm.  And the music, of course.  What makes the film version such a letdown is its literalness.  Director Clint Eastwood has taken a Broadway musical and turned it into a rather dreary biopic with the occasional song.  The film should soar as soon as the singing starts, but it just sits there.  What the material needed was a Rob Marshall or Martin Scorsese, someone who knows how to energize an audience and whip up some excitement with a distinct visual style.  This film has no style whatsoever, no point of view.  Eastwood turned on the camera and let the actors do what they do.  Okay, there's a little bit more to it than that, but it's a pretty dull affair.  John Lloyd Young is, unfortunately, a large part of the problem.  On stage he was electric, but here he's a cipher.  The other three Seasons are much better, particularly Vincent Piazza, who's like a lightning bolt among fireflies.  All in all, the film is a perfectly acceptable waste of two + hours, but it could have been a major event in the hands of a different director.",1405036800,4,1281,4.4655172413793105

Well, as usual, listening to reviewers is a waste of time. The movie was a fleshed-out version of the stage play, complete with era-correct cars, clothes, etc. The singing was wonderful and if the facts were fudged in certain cases, who cares?

6346854,5,B00J9BZOXY,"When Francesco Stephen Castelluccio stepped on the stage in Washington, DC a few days ago at the Capitol Fourth celebration of the Fourth of July, he needed no introduction.  Shrugging his shoulders and snapping his fingers, he took the mike and began to sing! It was the still strong falsetto voice...the voice of Frankie Valli, the lead singer of the Four Seasons.

In the eight years since the Broadway play of JERSEY BOYS won four Tony Awards including Best Musical, it's been hard to ignore the revival of the Four Seasons' many hits nor the mounting praise for the story of their rise from obscure local band to rock `n' roll sensation. Long before JERSEY BOYS reached its 3487th Broadway performance on April 9, 2014, a movie seemed in the works.  Warner Brothers dropped the project but Graham King of GK Films acquired the rights and picked Clint Eastwood to direct.

JERSEY BOYS, the film released on June 20, 2014, tells the story of the rise of The Four Seasons, an American rock and pop singing group, that was formed by three juvenile delinquents: Frankie Valli (Francesco Stephen Castelluccio), the lead singer, Nick Massi, bass guitar and vocals, and Tommy DeVito, lead guitar and baritone vocals,  who grew up around Newark, New Jersey in the 1950s. Bob Gaudio, a fellow from the Bronx formerly of the Royal Teens, joined the group in 1960 as tenor vocal on keyboards and wrote most of their early hit songs.

The movie is well cast.  John Lloyd Young, the Tony winner and original Broadway cast member, reprises his role as Valli.  Erich Bergen as Gaudio, Michael Lomenda as Massi, and Vincent Piazza as DeVito round out the other Four Seasons nicely.  The real life character of Gyp Decarlo is played by Christopher Walken.  Decarlo was a mob boss that had ties to The Four Seasons via Tommy DeVito who helped the group when Tommy racked up a significant amount of debts by mediating their negotiations with a loan shark.  Decarlo also, in the movie, tears up when he listens to Valli singing his first single, ""My Mother's Eyes"" (1953).

It's an American story, folks, this movie about the JERSEY BOYS.  It's the story of four American-born young men who achieved the American Dream.  And they did it on the Ed Sullivan show before that strange group of guys in funny hairdos from across the pond did it.

You'll come out of the theater humming those jukebox songs like ""Sherry""...""December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)""...""My Eyes Adored You""...""Can't Take My Eyes Off You""...""Working My Way Back to You"" and ""Rag Doll.""  Clint Eastwood and I probably don't recall all the words...but I bet somewhere Frankie Valli (also an octogenarian) is snapping his fingers and belting out all the words in his incredible falsetto voice.",1404691200,92,2741,4.812366737739872
6346855,3,B00J9BZOXY,"Whats it about?

You've heard of Frankie Valli and the Four SeasonsBut did you know they had mob connections and were friends with Joe Pesci?

What did I think?

Not heavy enough to be a mob movie, and not musical enough to be a musical. The history of the Four Seasons makes for a ripping yarn but with Clint Eastwood pumping it full of grit, it doesn't quite reach the joyous heights of the stage show until the last scene. Back away from the musicals, Clint. And get off my lawn!",1404604800,,482,4.274725274725275
6346856,4,B00J9BZOXY,"My siblings and I were raised on oldies tunes such as Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Growing up it was the only type of music I knew. I've also been privileged to see the stage show JERSEY BOYS and it's one of my favorite shows to see performed on stage. I was excited to hear that they were making the show into a movie and that Clint Eastwood was directing, although I did wonder how well the musical would translate into the big screen. JERSEY BOYS the stage show is a jukebox musical that was created specifically for the stage (unlike a show such as HAIRSPRAY that was based off a movie with all intents and purposes of being translated back to the screen someday). It appeared that with the announcement of the cast (all the actors had acted in the stage show and Christopher Walken was going to have a part as Gyp DeCarlo), that the movie would turn out fine. However, then I saw the trailers for the film and noticed the lack of marketing and began to wonder.

For the most part, JERSEY BOYS follows the script of the stage show word for word. Frankie Catelluccio (John Lloyd Young) lives in a fairly rough part of New Jersey. He's studying to be a barber, but he also has the voice of an angel. His friends are mostly low-level crooks and known associates of the mob. However, his friends know Frankie has a future as a musician if he can just get a break and his closest friend, Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) brings him into his band, the Four Lovers. Frankie changes his name to Frankie Valli and the group has some small successes, but things don't really take off until Joe Pesci (Joey Russo) introduces the group to the young songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen). From there, things skyrocket. The Four Lovers changes its name to The Four Seasons and soars into stardom. However, fame comes with a cost and the film follows different members of the group (mostly Frankie and Bob) until their reunion at The Four Seasons induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

The story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is a good one and one that should be told. It's a rags to riches tale, but also a tale about honor and friendship and respecting the debts owed to those who helped you when you couldn't help yourself.

For those expecting a complete musical adaptation of the stage show, JERSEY BOYS will probably be somewhat disappointing. It does follow the script of the stage show rather closely, with several additional scenes. Also unchanged is how the main characters will break the fourth wall and speak directly to the audience. This was something I thought might have been dropped from the movie and I'm glad it wasnt. With that said, this film is really a musical biopic and not a movie musical. Many if not most of the stage show numbers are in the film, but instead of being sung and performed as a big theatrical number, many of them have become a part of the soundtrack and underlie a scene that takes place on the screen. The movie is more akin in format to THE BILLY HOLLY STORY than it is to a movie like HAIRSPRAY.

In terms of a movie, JERSEY BOYS is fairly good. The acting is good and really sparkles in certain moments. Both Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio and Mike Doyle as Bob Crewe do an excellent job and Christopher Walken steals every scene that he is in.

However, JERSEY BOYS has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great move. That flaw is the film's length. With most of the script from the stage show intact, the movie is padded even more with a few extra scenes. This brings the total running time of the movie around 2 hours and fifteen minutes. In all reality, the movie should be closer to an hour and forty-five minutes. There's a good 15-20 minutes of the first act of the film that could have been completely cut and it would not have affected the plot of the movie at all. There are also a couple additional scenes that could have been cut without harming the plot (just about any time Frankie is riding in a car should have been cut). Once the first act ends and Bob Guido joins the group, the movie picks up the pace and doesn't really slow down until the end. However, the first act is so long and mostly unnecessary that it really dampens the flow and pace of the rest of the movie.

Other than the length of the film, the only other negative about the movie is the makeup job on the actors when they perform together at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Make up has come a long way, but the makeup on each of the actors looks more like something out of a local theatre production than it does a major motion picture. A couple of the guys look alright, but a couple of them look horrible as the aged versions of their characters.

Overall, JERSEY BOYS is an entertaining musical biopic. It will appeal to anyone who is interested in Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, but anyone who just likes a good story will probably enjoy it, too. The first act runs far longer than it should, but if you can make it past that, the rest of the film is a blast.",1404604800,6,5044,4.376734258271078

A side note: the outdoor public ice skating rink in NJ played Short Shorts as part of the music in the early 60's. A lot!

The movie adds so much more detail that the stage production can't.

And, although I hate people who pontificate in reviews, that's what I'm gonna do.

Film and stage are two very different animals.  Anyone who's watched a filmed or taped live performance knows this.  Even when the staging and performance is exactly the same as would have been seen 'live', it isn't the same.  Deal with it.

The fewer expectations you carry to any work of art (and I'm one of those Yahoos who thinks all films, even the most commercial, have an element of 'art' and 'artistry' to them) the more you will enjoy what you see and the fairer (is there such a word???) you will be to the creative people who labored to entertain or enlighten you.  Get an idea of the plot, if you must, and whether you should be laughing or crying by the end, and open yourself up to just enjoy what you get.
It'll be hard enough to get what you want even then but you'll get it more often.  In other words, give yourself permission to be pleased.  Makes life and films much more satisfying.

That being said, it was an entertaining film, made even more so because I remember every silly thing my friends and I were doing when we heard those songs for the first time.  The film chose to land on the side of how it sort-of-really-was rather than a glitzy performance of what it should have been.  Even so, mobsters have heart, debts are repaid, family collapses are survived, and we all are friends again in the end.  Maybe it is as fantastical as a glitzy Broadway production but the music makes it work.

If you want to see Broadway, you're right, go to Broadway.  But  since I live in the Heartland, a thousand and more miles west of the Midwest (where I grew up) and just as far east of the sea and sun, I'll take good films whenever I can get one.

6346871,5,B00J9BZOXY,"This is the movie based on the international hit musical show.

It's an entertaining and engaging biopic, telling the story of the Four Seasons musical group, and its members.

The focus of the movie is on telling the story of the band, rather than performance of the music. Nonetheless, several of the Four Seasons hits are presented as part of the story.

Translating a musical from the stage to the screen can be a difficult process. The translation of Jersey Boys has involved a refocussing on the narrative story, rather than the music. I suspect the film is best viewed on its own merits as a biopic, rather than a stage show adapted to the screen. The structure of the story telling has been changed significantly from the stage show (which tells the group's story from the perspective of each member).

I thought the direction by Clint Eastwood was masterful- telling the story in a matter of fact fashion, effectively blending drama, emotion and humor. The interactions between the members of the band - in particular their tensions - are portrayed realistically.

It is an entertaining and well crafted film, which I suspect will satisfy most viewers. The finale is particularly entertaining, featuring all the characters performing together- as in the finale to a stage production.

6346872,3,B00J9BZOXY,"You know how, when first you read a book, then see the movie, the movie usually seems to fall short? Well.... After seeing the stage productions of ""Jersey Boys"" many times (Seattle, Tampa, London and New York), this sets me up for a fall. This is a four-person biography with occasional songs which has been drawn from a stage musical. What we do NOT see is the musicality, the theatricality and the immediacy of the stage version. I wanted joyful exuberance.

Bless Clint Eastwood for trying. He attended stage versions of this theatrical biography of ""Frankie Valle and the Four Seasons,"" aka ""Jersey Boys,"" which thrilled the professionals. He selected players from those versions, even though their characters' stories are diluted and stretched out in this 134 minute R-rated (language) ramble. What we see is hardscrabble beginnings, meteoric (ten long years) rise to fame, then the downside, which can best be done by a director who has first-hand experience.

We have:
  * John Lloyd Young (""Jersey Boys"" - 2006 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Broadway musical) as Frankie Valle, a young barber trainee who wants out of Jersey. He is bullied and dominated by a ""friend,"" Tommy DeVito, who is forming a musical group.
  * Vincent Piazza (""Boardwalk Empire"") as Tommy DeVito, who revels in his creation, changes the course of American musical history...and never lets anyone forget it! In MY opinion, this guy is a cocky, amoral sociopath, and too much screen time is wasted on his youthful crimes.
  * Erich Bergen (""Jersey Boys"" Las Vegas cast) as Bob Gaudio, the brilliant songwriter who heard Valli and thought, ""I could write for THAT voice!"" (His parents wanted him to go to trade school.)
  * Michael Lomenda (""Jersey Boys"") as Nick Massi, the ""forgotten one"" (he's the Ringo of this quartet). He couldn't STAND being DeVito's roommate: ""The man is an ANIMAL!""
  * Joseph Russo (""It's Not You, It's Me"") is Joe ""Joey"" Pesci. Yup, THAT Joe Pesci. He introduced Gaudio to Valli.
  * Christopher Walken (""Seven Psychopaths"") is Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo, the mobster who hears Frankie sing ""My Mother's Eyes"" and is a loyal Valli fan from the get go.
  * Mike Doyle (Lots of TV) as producer Bob Crewe, a ""theatrical"" fellow who helps launch the group; he understands the business side of the music business.

I take serious issue with the music. I hope the copy I saw was at fault, because the balance was waaaay off and the horn section was simply a cacophony which ruined ""You're Just Too Good To Be True."" Other selections were off balance, badly mixed and too stylized; most songs become stylized after they have been hits for awhile. ""Who Wears Short Shorts"" was so stylized in the early scenes, I wouldn't have recognized it if I hadn't known it was there. (Bob Gaudio wrote his first hit song when he was 15 years old, but this isn't mentioned here; he was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 1995.)

BTW, I purchased the book ""Places Please"" by Daniel Robert Sullivan which is based on his torturous journey to play Tommy DeVito in the Toronto show. It is a great insider's look at the demands made on performers who desperately want to be cast; it describes the hard work and the meticulous choreography involved in the stage versions of ""Jersey Boys.""

If you haven't been spoiled by the stage version, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this interesting story, interspersed with well-known songs that are part of the fabric of our lives. If you've seen and loved the stage version, maybe not so much...

It is based on the long-running, massively popular Broadway musical of the same name.  As a film, it was directed by the iconic actor/macho movie star/director Clint Eastwood and written by Marshall Brickman.  According to Broadway.com, as quoted at IMDb, ""Jersey Boys is a musical biography of the Four Seasons-the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on front man Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.""

Many reviewers have noted that director Eastwood was shrewd enough to cast as his principals mainly  young men who have worked in the theatrical production.  His stars include Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli, Johnny Cannizzaro as Nick DeVito and Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi.  I'd never seen any of them before, as unfortunately, I left New York and its Broadway some years ago.  And, in fact, I knew hardly any of the actors up on the screen, just Steve Schirripa, (THE SOPRANOS), as Vito; noted dancer Christopher Walken, (HAIRSPRAY), as Gyp DeCarlo, good-hearted mobster, and Lou Volpe, frequently cast as an Italian father, as Frankie's father.  But I rather liked the fact that I was seeing most of these actors for the first time; it added to the movie's credibility for me.  The qualifications of director Eastwood, who by now is possibly as well-known as a director,(INVICTUS, GRAN TORINO, MILLION DOLLAR BABY); as an actor, (BLOODWORK, UNFORGIVEN) have been questioned by some reviewers I have read elsewhere who doubt his ability to handle musical material.  Of course, other reviewers have replied that, in his career he has directed PLAY MISTY FOR ME, and BIRD, which was about jazzman Charlie Parker, both with musical themes.  Though never anything about rock and roll and it's possible he's not the best possible director for this material.  Many reviewers have also complained that the film is predictable, and utilizes every clich&eacute; in the book about its genre.  Guess this is more or less true; but whether it's to be a biopic about the Beatles or the Four Seasons it seems there are some constants, Stations of the Cross if you will.  Scuffling working class lads, who may have a few brushes with the law, or with the local mobsters.  Validation on the Ed Sullivan show.  The touring life, partying, girls, drugs, quarreling and dissolution of the group.  Stations of the Cross.  Hard to avoid.  Another reviewer complained that Christopher Walken, who began in show business as a dancer, wasn't in the big final dance scene.  But he was, saw him with my own eyes.  Perhaps not as front and center as he deserved to be, but hey...

Well, as urbanites, in this house, we love a floating falsetto lead:  Frankie Lyman of the Teenagers, Smokey Robinson, Aaron Neville, Frankie Valli. I was lucky enough to see Frankie Valli once, at New York's Radio City Music Hall, and it was memorable.  My husband and I have been recommended many times to see ""Jerseys Boys"" on Broadway.  Haven't been able to manage it, doubt we ever will, though I believe it's still actually playing.  Too bad.  So we were eager to see the movie.  And we really liked it.  Well, it's our music; we know the melodies and words in our  red blood cells.  Similarly, you know whether it'll be your thing.

Me, I've been humming and singing those songs all week, ever since seeing the picture.  Maybe I'll declare myself the fifth Season?",1403913600,20,4287,4.8273972602739725
6346874,5,B00J9BZOXY,"I don't know if I can put it into words!  First, I love the music.  Its the music that I grew up on and I was always a huge Frankie Valli fan.  Absolutely love his voice!  Second, the guys in the movie are excellent choices to play their characters.  John Lloyd Young is wonderful in the role of Frankie.  I loved the fact that Clint Eastwood had all the music done live for the film and not ""canned"" stuff that takes away from the magic.  I love the way that the movie told the story with insights from each of the characters.  I loved Christopher Walken's portrayal of Gyp.  I learned quite a few things about my favorite group that I never knew and it just endeared them to me that much more.  I understand (from an interview with Frankie Valli) that the group kept much of the ""seedier"" aspects of their lives private because they were afraid that they would not get recording contracts or get their music heard.  And I can see that happening from that period of time.  I've seen the movie twice and plan to go again.  I have already ordered the DVD to be shipped to me when it is available.  I have also downloaded music by John Lloyd Young and I can't stop listening to it.  It brings back many memories....",1403913600,106,1213,4.28193832599119
6346875,4,B00J9BZOXY,"Saw this one on the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The music has been running through my head for days, but then it was partly the music of my day -- which is to say I was blessed with the music of the 50's, and then the 60's too, which is still to be topped in my book.  Anyway, back to the movie: not a great classic, but it was pleasant, engrossing entertainment.  That's what I go out to see, whatever the genre may be.  I just like to be entertained with a well produced film, and this one did the job.",1403827200,5,515,3.970873786407767

If you're forced to choose between Jersey Boys the Broadway Musical or Clint Eastwood's movie, I would recommend seeing the Broadway show. While the movie shows more in terms of historical material, the musical proves to be much more of an emotional experience.

Eastwood starts the story of the Four Seasons with perhaps too much exposition. Christopher Walken shows up in the thankless role of 'Gyp', a local Mafioso who the founding member of the band, local hothead Tommy DeVito is beholden to. DeVito introduces Gyp to teenager Frankie Castelluccio (who later changes his name to Frankie Valli). We then learn how DeVito gets the young Frankie involved in criminal activity, DeVito ends up taking a 6 month rap for the burglary they were both involved in, Frankie meets Mary Delgado who convinces him to change his name to Valli (and they eventually get married), Nick Massi becomes part of the group and is sent to prison for trespassing at a local church (again Frankie is let off) and Frankie ends up a victim of a scam by two local hoodlums, one who pretends to murder the other.

A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed in order to get us to Act 2 sooner. Act 2 of course begins when Bob Gaudio joins the group and this is where the story gets interesting. Gaudio is the complete opposite of DeVito. He's an intellectual who quotes T.S. Elliot and his quite knowledgeable about the music business. DeVito is a gambler who demands to be the center of attention. Valli, on the other hand, though streetwise like Devito, is much more conservative and ends up making a business deal with Gaudio to split songwriting royalties and any outside business not involving the group.

The group's rise to fame is quite entertaining as we learn how they hook up with their flamboyant, gay producer, Bob Crewe, who guides them in releasing their first hit, 'Sherry'. We get to hear a good number of the Four Seasons' big hits, which are staged by Eastwood as performance pieces (as opposed to big choreographed numbers).

One of the best scenes is when Gaudio, Valli and Massi learn of DeVito's $100K debt to a loan shark as well as approximately $600K to the IRS. The honorable Valli agrees to play in Vegas until he pays off DeVito's debt. Before quitting the group, Massi sounds off about life on the road with DeVito and how difficult it was putting up with the tough guy narcissist. Gaudio and Valli had it easier, since they didn't have to room with the surly DeVito.

Once the group breaks up, the focus is on Valli who must deal with the tragedy of the death of his daughter, due to a drug overdose. I seem to recall that the daughter's death was much more effective on stage than the way it's handled here by director Eastwood. Like all the female characters in the movie, Valli's daughter is underdeveloped and the way in which her demise is dealt with, seems a bit rushed.

The ending of the film focuses on The Four Seasons induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. We learn what the band members were doing after years had passed and one notes that there is a reconciliation between DeVito and Valli. Clint Eastwood attempts to stage a big production number at film's end, but it falls completely flat (at one point the big cast freezes a number of times, and the entire production number ends up looking quite pathetically awkward).

The acting is quite decent with John Lloyd Young (who starred in the original Broadway production) reproducing Frankie Valli's unusual falsetto voice. As in the Broadway show, each character speaks to the audience, inducing a Rashomon-like effect--telling the story from their different perspectives.

Once Jersey Boys gets to the formation of The Four Seasons, the story takes on a life of its own. You can't argue with hearing all those great hits, souped up in modern day arrangements. I would recommend seeing this film but would also recommend seeing the Broadway show if you're ever in NYC. The film is not without its flaws (it could have been pared down), but in the end, it certainly entertains.",1403654400,6,4110,4.713091922005571
6346877,4,B00J9BZOXY,"""Jersey Boys"" (2014 release; 134 min.) is the big screen adaptation of the Broadway show ""Jersey Boys"", itself loosely based on the life and times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. As the movie opens, we are in 1951 in Belleville, NJ, where Frankie, then 16, is working in a barber shop. Over the course of the next 45 min., we get to know the other guys who would make up the group that would eventually name itself the Four Seasons (after a bowling alley, if we can believe the movie), and how slowly but surely the band is working towards success. The second half of the movie deals with less music-oriented themes, but focuses more on the tensions within the band and the personal sufferings and even tragedies they experience. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, I have not seen the Broadway show, so I cannot comment how closely it stays to that, although I am guessing that the dramatic elements have been played up and prolonged for Hollywood purposes (and that's fine by me). Second, the movie is directed (and also produced) by Clint Eastwood. If that surprises you, it really shouldn't as Eastwood is known to be a passionate music aficionado (he not only directed another music bio-pic ""Bird"" about jazz saxophonist Charlie ""Bird"" Parker in the late 80s, but he has also composed the movie score for a number of his movies, including the Oscar-winning ""Million Dollar Baby""). I happen to think Eastwood is one of the great director of this age, and at a mere 84 years of age, he's just getting warmed up! The movie is rich with visual details that you just feel are Eastwood's touch. Third, usually in this type of bio-pic, the earlier years tend to be the most interesting ones. Strangely enough, the exact opposite is true here: for me the movie didn't really take off until we see the four guys go at it against each other, with Tommy DeVito easily taking the price for biggest (take your pick) jerk/egomaniac, and later when Frankie deals with his estranged family (due to being on the road almost non-stop). Fourth, there are some great performances in the movie, none more so that John Lloyd Young as Frankie, the role which he also played for several years when the show opened on Broadway. You swear that it is Frankie himself. And that voice!

Bottom line: although a bit long for its own good, ""Jersey Boys"" was very enjoyable, more so than I expected. To be honest, I don't know that I would've gone to see this, but for the fact that Eastwood directed this. The movie opened here in Cincinnati last weekend, and I saw it on a late matinee work day. I was quite surprised how well attended that screening was, indicating that this movie may have some legs amidst all of the seemingly endless stream of comic book and other such super-heroes action movies. ""Jersey Boys"" is definitely worth checking out, be in in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray!",1403654400,155,2976,4.623818525519849
