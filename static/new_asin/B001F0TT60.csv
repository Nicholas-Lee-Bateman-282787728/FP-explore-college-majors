I thought everyone acted very well--especially Ted Nudgent--it suited his real personality perfect.  I never knew that Toby Keith could act, let alone write stories and he did an excellent job in both departments. This movie has a little of everything for you--action, comedy, and even a little romance. I don't think I heard a curse word during the whole movie--unless you count the word, piss. Sex was alluded to at times, but never shown, so I really appreciated that.

It's a fun movie with solid laughs and some hilarious situations.  Rodney Carrington is an excellent side kick and steals his scenes.  Yep, I'll watch it again and laugh at my favorite parts.  The production values are kind of crappy and the acting is obvious - except you gotta LOVE Rodney!  Toby is pretty believable and kind of subdued compared to his ""normal"" public persona, but he's likable and determined to do the right thing.

It is not a revolutionary movie by any stretch of the imagination, it doesn't push any boundries or shock or amaze the viewer, but it is a solid comedy that uses proven (some might say formulaic) methods to entertain. This is just a thoroughly entertaining and funny movie that I can watch over and over.  I especially like the scene where Toby comes home late and his girlfriend is moving out because he missed her birthday. I find myself shouting ""You hit my mower!"" whenever some accident or unfortunate incident occurs.

Just Talk To Ted's Gun's Or When You Run You'll Get An Arrow Up Your Ass. A Lot Of People Have Said Bad Things About This Movie, Well Their Wrong. They Cryed Because Ted Didn't Get Enough Words To Say, With Ted He Didn't Need To Speak, He Showed It All In How He Carried His Self And His Guns And His Bow.(Loved Were He Carried His Badge) If Ted Wanted More Lines He Would Have Get Them Or He Would Be Doing The Walking.

3560188,5,B001F0TT60,"""Beer For My Horses"" turns out to be a humorous quest for justice, with most unexpected scenes.  Toby Keith and Rodney Atkins with a cameo Willie Nelson scene, what more can you ask for.  I wonder if the movie was written for the song or the song for the movie.  Hope it is appropriate to say and normally you wouldn't expect, but the bathroom incident is hysterical, every time I watch the movie.  To see what I mean you would have to watch the movie.

I had to purchase another one somewhere else. I found out also that my daughter also purchased a video from you and it arrived broken because there wasn't any packaging in the box.

3560194,2,B001F0TT60,"Toby Keith is a great country artist. I have all his records. I would buy all future records from him without checking any reviews instantly. But, Toby Keith is no actor. He has several films that prove this. Beer for my Horses is just one of them. I would not say that the film is bad, just one of those products that you can spend some time with if you have nothing else to do, like watching a good DVD.

The Music is of course great and I will buy the soundtrack. Claire Forlani makes the story much more pleasant to live through.

I was thinking on giving this DVD three stars just because of the music but sadly Amazon again forgot to inform that there were no subtitles. So, again a lot of the dialogue was lost. It is imperative that this vital information is presented together with the product when you are considering buying it. This DVD had subtitles in Spanish but sadly not in English.

BTW: There are no horses in this film....",1292025600,2,941,4.3352272727272725

3560197,2,B001F0TT60,"I have no earthly idea what ""Beer for My Horses"" is supposed to be or whom it's supposed to appeal to, but it does have one of the most unusual casts I've seen in ages.  Rock and country music stars Toby Keith, Willie Nelson, Mel Tillis, Ted Nugent, Mac Davis and David Allen Coe join up with actual, honest-to-God actors like Tom Skerrit and Claire Forlani in a film derived from Keith's hit country song of the same name.

In fact, Keith co-wrote, directed and plays the lead in this tale of an Oklahoma sheriff whose girlfriend is kidnapped after he and his men arrest the brother of a nefarious Mexican drug lord for stealing fertilizer, apparently a key ingredient in meth production (who knew?).  Soon, the law enforcer and his posse are headed south-of-the-border to rescue the girl.

Keith has thrown just about everything he can think of into the mix:  small-town buffoonery, race-tinged melodrama, low-keyed romance, a troupe of circus performers, a flatulent bulldog, and more scowling Mexicans than you can shake a sombrero at.  Somehow it's all supposed to go together, but even the most accomplished filmmaker would have trouble making it all work.  Still, it's so homespun, scruffy and amiable that criticizing it too harshly would be like kicking the family mutt.",1273968000,7,1279,4.893518518518518
3560198,4,B001F0TT60,"... and I think Toby is a much better singer-songwriter than he is a screenwriter or actor but I DID enjoy this movie.  Directed by Michael Soloman, Toby's longtime partner who has done nearly all his music videos, this movie very much had the humor, personality and quirkiness that a lot of Toby's music videos display.  I think that Toby is someone who has ""it"" and I find him mostly enjoyable to watch as an actor but there is still room for improvement in that area (although I think he did a really great job with his previous movie ""Broken Bridges"". Obviously ""Beer For My Horses"" was not a movie that required that level of acting anyway).  The addition of Ted Nugent in this film was really genius and I wish that there were more scenes with him.  Overall, I got the impression that Toby has the money, contacts and talent to do whatever he wants and that this was just a fun venture for everyone.  I don't think they were trying to make the next ""Gone With the Wind"" or something.  I think they made a movie that was funny and cool to them and they obviously enjoyed playing around with all their big boy toys (big trucks, live stock, guns, explosives, etc.). I enjoyed watching it because I could tell that they were just having a lot of fun and there were a lot of funny moments. And it wasn't too long!  Movies are always too long for me now! :/",1269216000,,1357,4.339920948616601

They really down-played Rodney's role! I like Toby Keith as a singer but I believe this movie was all about him and he is no actor either and it showed thru out the movie. They could've made Rodney 10x better and he could've made the movie himself without Toby. Sorry guys but this was not good of any of you.,1251072000,,487,4.083333333333333

I waited until recently to buy a copy from Amazon.com and therefore had lots of time to build up plenty of hype about Beer for my Horses.  Unfortunately the movie did not live up to expectations.  There were some funny parts, but the story line was a bit lame.  Toby Keith is a great country star, but maybe should choose better material for this movie, showing that he can after his movie Broken Bridges that I would highly recommend.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Bridges/dp/B000JLTRKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Bridges</a>

There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up.  Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up?  The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH.  As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up.  I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.

If you like heavyweight, super-serious plots with shaky cameras and edgy plot twists, this is not for you.
