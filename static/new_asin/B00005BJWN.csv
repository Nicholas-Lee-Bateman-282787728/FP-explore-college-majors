3017486,5,B00005BJWN,"Casino is one of my favorite movies. It is a bit violent at times, but very intense and captivating. Carlito's Way was also excellent. It was a little slow at times, but in general it was great and the ending was epic.",1396656000,,218,4.214285714285714
3017487,4,B00005BJWN,"Casino by itself is an all-time classic. Alone I would give it 5 stars.
Carlito's way is only 3 stars. The movie doesn't provide enough information about his past. They make references to it, but you're left
out in the cold wishing you could have at least a glimpse of it.
It's quite stereotypical, quite similar to many other movies, and the ending is quite predicatble.",1391990400,,371,4.636363636363637
3017488,5,B00005BJWN,"Like the previous reviewer I was nervous when I opened this set after purchasing it. If it was a flip disc I would be annoyed. My all-time favorite movie Goodfellas I own on flip disc and it's annoying having to get up and turn the DVD over at the midway point.

Luckily there was a separate disc for each film and some special features with each.

I purchased the set when I want into my local Barnes and Noble looking for Carlito's Way. They had the subpar direct to video sequel. But not the 1993 original. I mentioned this to the cashier and he found this set. Seeing as I like Casino yet had not acquired it on DVD I figured I might as well go for it.

Now on to the films themselves.

In a way it's appropriate that Carlito's Way and Casino ended up bundled together in this set. Both are films by master directors at the top of their game and both exist in teh shadow of a more highly regarded film by the same director.

Casino is often forgotten because it exists in the shadow of Goodfellas. It's not quite on the same level of greatness that the earlier Scorsese film is. Parts of it are derivative and a good 20 minutes could've been shaved off the run time. But even if it falls just short of greatness it is still a very good film. Definitely worth owning for the story, Scorsese's direction and the performances by De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone (the best acting she's ever done).

Calito's Way on the other hand is ahead of its more iconic counterpart (Scarface) in some ways. It's not as over the top as the earlier film, Pacino dials down when he needs to, the overall acting is better and De Palma has better control over the story and its trajectory. In some ways, I actually prefer this one to Scarface.

Unlike other sets of this type which are pretty barebones, this one has rom on both discs for a few special featurwes. Mostly making of material which is pretty interesting.

I definitely recommend this set to fans of gangster films or of Scorsese and De Palma or just looking for a way to get both films at once.",1377129600,8,2040,4.321989528795812
3017489,5,B00005BJWN,"The product description wasn't clear if this is really a two-dvd set, or another two-movies-on-one-disc flipper.  (I'd rather spend the extra money and have the movies on seperate discs)  Well I took a chance and bought the Casino/Carlito's Way Double Feature to find out for myself.

It IS a two-dvd set!

Each movie is on a single-sided DVD.  The top of each disc is black with the title in silver.

Both movies have been released multiple times on DVD, and judging by the Amazon reviews, some versions are better than others.  I can't tell which versions these are, but I've watched both DVDs and they look beautiful.  Vibrant colors, clear picture and clear sound.  Fully animated title menus with music.  Both movies are in widescreen (anamorphic 2.35:1) and are complete (both have the correct running times--3 hours for Casino, 2 1/2 hours for Carlito)  Also, even though this set was released in October 2012, the copyright date on both discs is 2009.  I don't know if that means anything, but there you go.

Special Features--

Casino:  ""Casino: The Story"", Deleted Scenes and a scene-specific movie commentary with Martin Scorcese, Sharon Stone, and Nicholas Pileggi

Carlito's Way:  ""The Making of Carlito's Way"", Photo Gallery, Theatrical Trailer

That's everything I wanted to know about this set.  I hope it helps.

If you don't own either of these films, this is a GREAT deal.",1376006400,24,1391,4.9393939393939394
3017490,4,B00005BJWN,"casino (de niro) is a slow goodfellas (has the same actors > de niro, pesci; and director > scorsese).. but its still a great movie, it has great acting, directing, and story.
carlito's way (pacino) seems like its a sequal to scarface (which also stars pacino, & also directed by de palma). like casino, carlito's way is a slower paced version of its previous counterpart, but its still a great movie.

3017524,5,B00005BJWN,"I am specifically focusing on ""Carlito's Way, ""although I bought this double feature disc.

This has to be one of the best gangster films ever made.  It is as a work of cinemagraphic art: very beautiful and elegant.  The music, the colors, the sets, the cinematography, the action are elevated way above the realm of brutality and destruction.

And the main character, Carlito, and his story run against gangster flick tradition.  Carlito is a good guy.  He grew up in an Italian/Puerto Rican/African American ghetto on the upper east side of Manhattan where he learned to be a gangster and deal drugs.  When the movie starts he is released from prison on early parole and we soon learn that Carlito has the heart not of a criminal, but of a lion. He is a tough, strong guy who wants to go straight and lead a decent life.  Al Pacino enfolds courage, honor, loyalty, decency, warmth, tenderness, kindness, mercy, and love into this beautifully nuanced exposition. In my opinion, it is one of the best performances of his career.

""Carlito's Way"" is a film whose dramatic dimensions are Shakespearean. I loved the central character whose story arc has been sealed by Fate, and I cared about and believed in all the other characters.

And don't let me forget that DePalma includes scenes of beautifully choreographed suspense that can compete with suspense masters.

This is a beautifully wrought work of art.  Do yourself a favor and see it.",1447113600,2,1440,4.808943089430894

3017534,5,B00005BJWN,"This is an awesome double feature in the gangster genre.  The movies comes on separate discs which I like much better than having to turn on over to watch the movies.  So easy to scratch one side or the other.

Casino is a Scorcese mob film in which Deniro and Pesci are eastern gangsters who travel west to Las Vegas to ply their trade at the casino business.  Filled with tough scrapes, shady deals, a rise to power and of course, the inevitable fall, Casino fires hot and heavy.

Carlito's Way is a bit more romanticized since there is a love interest for the title character who is not a pill popping, alcoholic gold digger.  The film tells the opposite story where a veteran gangster promises to go straight...and actually means it.  Definitely one of Pacino's best performances, former drug dealer Carlito has just been released from prison thanks to his crafty lawyer and seeks a new life and a better one.  A very good gangster film about flawed people.",1437177600,,961,4.6117647058823525

3251987,4,B00005BJWN,"casino (de niro) is a slow goodfellas (has the same actors > de niro, pesci; and director > scorsese).. but its still a great movie, it has great acting, directing, and story.
carlito's way (pacino) seems like its a sequal to scarface (which also stars pacino, & also directed by de palma). like casino, carlito's way is a slower paced version of its previous counterpart, but its still a great movie.

3252021,5,B00005BJWN,"I am specifically focusing on ""Carlito's Way, ""although I bought this double feature disc.

This has to be one of the best gangster films ever made.  It is as a work of cinemagraphic art: very beautiful and elegant.  The music, the colors, the sets, the cinematography, the action are elevated way above the realm of brutality and destruction.

And the main character, Carlito, and his story run against gangster flick tradition.  Carlito is a good guy.  He grew up in an Italian/Puerto Rican/African American ghetto on the upper east side of Manhattan where he learned to be a gangster and deal drugs.  When the movie starts he is released from prison on early parole and we soon learn that Carlito has the heart not of a criminal, but of a lion. He is a tough, strong guy who wants to go straight and lead a decent life.  Al Pacino enfolds courage, honor, loyalty, decency, warmth, tenderness, kindness, mercy, and love into this beautifully nuanced exposition. In my opinion, it is one of the best performances of his career.

""Carlito's Way"" is a film whose dramatic dimensions are Shakespearean. I loved the central character whose story arc has been sealed by Fate, and I cared about and believed in all the other characters.

And don't let me forget that DePalma includes scenes of beautifully choreographed suspense that can compete with suspense masters.

This is a beautifully wrought work of art.  Do yourself a favor and see it.",1447113600,2,1440,4.808943089430894

3252031,5,B00005BJWN,"This is an awesome double feature in the gangster genre.  The movies comes on separate discs which I like much better than having to turn on over to watch the movies.  So easy to scratch one side or the other.

Casino is a Scorcese mob film in which Deniro and Pesci are eastern gangsters who travel west to Las Vegas to ply their trade at the casino business.  Filled with tough scrapes, shady deals, a rise to power and of course, the inevitable fall, Casino fires hot and heavy.

Carlito's Way is a bit more romanticized since there is a love interest for the title character who is not a pill popping, alcoholic gold digger.  The film tells the opposite story where a veteran gangster promises to go straight...and actually means it.  Definitely one of Pacino's best performances, former drug dealer Carlito has just been released from prison thanks to his crafty lawyer and seeks a new life and a better one.  A very good gangster film about flawed people.",1437177600,,961,4.6117647058823525
