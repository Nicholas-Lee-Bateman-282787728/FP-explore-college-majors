I recommend this film to any Christian, to give a fresh slant on the Judas story.  I recommend it to any non-Christian for its sheer power.",1184889600,2,390,4.402777777777778
2560451,4,B000FC2HRC,"This is the usual well done, a little slow, Nat. Geog. piece about an arcane piece of antiquity which may or may not be relevant to modern Christians depending on their current beliefs.

  Those who believe the current published Bible is the infallible, complete word of God will be understandably upset by the way this program basically sets the Gnostic gospels up as ""missing parts"" or edited parts. Controversy sells.

  There was an obvious, missed opportunity to discuss some of Peter's letters where he tells early churches to stop doing many of the practices that the Gnostics continued. Practices which are referred to here as collateral information on different sects in the early church.  These sects DID exist, but they were fringe groups even at that time, and Peter's letters said those practices were not of God.  A missed opportunity for full information.

  As with most Nat. Geog. specials, the focus here is on the scientific testing of the papyrus, the ""ink""... all fascinating forensic stuff, if you like that. I do.

  Where this fits or not into your religious viewpoint is what becomes contentious.  There ARE multiple views expressed here, most of which think this ""Judas Gospel"" is irrelevant, except for the one woman who speaks in almost every ""bible history"" special because what she says is very fringe theology, and she makes people angry, which ramps up viewership.

  If you believe Jesus was/is the omnipotent Lord, then it isn't a stretch to believe that he allready knew what Judas would do, and died for Judas' sins just as he did for everyone.  So Judas alone is not that controversial (which is why they had to drop in the other Gnostic stuff).

  IF you watch this DVD, be SURE to watch ALL the special feature interviews: each historians and biblical scholars gets his full (edited) say.  MUCH more informative than just what was broadcasted.

  If you are not interested in forensic sciences, this will be a bore, or extremely vexing.  View it only as something to augment your ""comparative religion"" studies.",1164499200,15,2050,4.918128654970761
2560452,4,B000FC2HRC,"There are startling, powerful ideas revealed somewhat effortlessly, through this documentary. While the ideas may not be new to a very small fraction of the general public, the majority of us will be served well by such a compact introduction to gnosticism, and it's hidden role in our own history. Indeed, it is amazing how this history continues to struggle to make it's self heard.

If anyone has ever taken an Eastern Religion class and wondered why our religion, Christianity, seems so blunt by comparison, the discovery of the Gnosticism will serve as a sort of missing link, to a story-chain that didn't quite add up.

I have to concure with some of the earlier reviewers, National Geographic is a tad goofy in their production style, but they still have that great theme song! so I'm standing by them.",1156204800,3,809,4.81294964028777
2560453,5,B000FC2HRC,"This is a compelling film by National Geographic about the discovery and restoration of one of the lost gnostic gospels, The Gospel of Judas.

Thanks to another smear campaign by the Church, Judas, for centuries has been labeled one of history's most evil and hated men.  As we learn from this film, it's actually illegal to name your child ""Judas"" in Germany. So, imagine the Church's reaction when the Gospel of Judas was ""accidentally"" found by a poor Egyptian farmer.  This codex book then made its way to several book collectors until it sat in a bank safe deposit box for nearly 16 years!  None of these book collectors knew what they had until one took the book to Yale University and was told that she possessed the Gospel of Judas.

The film is fascinating as some of the top experts of history and restoration gather together to try and save this book which was in terrible condition.

Once restored and legible to read, the Gospel of Judas offers some extremely compelling information about the relationship between Judas and Jesus.  What if for all of these centuries, we've had it wrong?  What if Judas wasn't a villain, but actually one of Jesus's greatest and most advanced disciples?  What if Jesus actually asked Judas to play a role; to betray him so that his mission could be carried out to completion?

Just as Mary Magdalene has been subjected to stories of her being a sinner and a prostitute, so has Judas been bombarded with accusations of betrayal and his very name synonomous with evil itself.  However, Jesus seems to predict this as he tells Judas that his very name shall be cursed through the ages for what Jesus is asking Judas to do.  But, he's asking, because he knows that Judas is the only one of the twelve who KNOWS who he is!  Perhaps he realizes that Judas is the only one who could carry out this role.

However, even with this knowledge, the grief (and Jesus predicts this as well) is too much for Judas to bare after having ""betrayed"" his Master, he ultimately commits suicide.

So many questions are coming to light now.  So many secrets have obviously been buried by the Church for centuries, and they are now, finally, beginning to come back to light.  No secret can stay hidden forever.  There are more than 30 Gnostic Gospels which contain much more information about the teachings of Jesus.  Were they cast aside because they conflicted with what the Church thought everyone should be learning?  Were they cast aside because some felt they were too difficult to understand, given the level of man's understanding at that point in history?

These are interesting questions.  Ultimately, each individual person must answer them for his/herself.  The Church has used fear as a basis for control over its followers; fear of knowledge is their own fear.

After watching this film and reading the Gospel of Judas, you may find yourself questioning the validity and veracity of all you have ever been told is truth, and finally discovering for your Self, the truth.",1155081600,16,3006,4.747591522157996
2560454,4,B000FC2HRC,"I wish the National Geographic Society would avoid the cheesy reenactments and dramatizations of scenes from ""The Gospel of Judas.""  It turns this otherwise excellent documentary into a Sunday morning Bible Studies television show.  No need to dumb-down this powerful story of how this Gosepl was found and authenticated. There is enough mystery and intrigue in the real story without inserting costume dramas with contemporary actors.",1154476800,2,435,5.575757575757576
2560455,5,B000FC2HRC,"They say that truth is stranger than fiction, and this movie proves it.  The story of the Gospel of Judas isn't just one story, its several interlocking stories, with more twists and turns than ""the Da Vinci Code"". There's the story of the grave robbers who found a long-lost codex in a tomb in Egypt. There's the story of the Gnostic Christian who wrote the Gospel of Judas. There's the story of Irenaeus and the proto-orthodox church who formed the New Testament cannon, excluding the Gospel of Judas.  There's the story of the intrigue of the antiquities markets: theft, recovery, and dealings of various shades of legality.

But amazingly, this movie talks about even more--what are the implications of the Gospel of Judas?  What does this gospel mean for us today?  How does the Gospel of Judas portray the character of Judas?  How does that compare with how the 4 gospels of the New Testament portray Judas?

How do these stories tie in with world events?  Some of the most disturbing scenes of the film are 2nd-century christians being led into the arena to be burned alive, and 20th-century Jews being led into concentration camps.  In a very sensitive way, this movie does an excellent job of drawing the connection between these two events, and how this thread runs through how the character of Judas has been perceived through the ages.

So what does the Gospel of Judas mean for us today?  As the movie makes clear, the Gospel of Judas really doesn't shed any light on the historical Jesus.  It was clearly written after the 4 gospels of the New Testament were written.  In fact, it is clearly written in reaction to them.  Moreover, it would be unthinkable to add the Gospel of Judas to the New Testament cannon, as it just doesn't cohere with the 4 canonical gospels.  It would be a much better fit with Nag Hammadi library, sharing as it does the Gnostic comology and world-view.

For me, the biggest takeaway message is that the story of the Gospel of Judas really is a mirror into which we can view the story of humanity as a whole.  Can we define our relation to The Divine without demonizing each other?  Can we live consecrated lives without killing each other?

We have our answer in the Gospel of Judas.  For me, the story of the Gospel of Judas is the story of a devout Christian living sometime in the second century, who read the 4 canonical gospels, and saw something potentially very dangerous in how the character of Judas was being portrayed.  The author of the Gospel of Judas seems to me to be saying ""yes, its true that we are different from Judeism.  But we can be different from Judeism without being antisemitic.""  This is a message from the Gospel of Judas which is as valid today as it was in the 2nd century.

This movie shows us just how close this message of the Gospel of Judas came to being snuffed out--and it shows the heroic efforts made by scholars and conservationists who have saved it for us and for the ages.",1152921600,5,2958,4.579847908745247
2560456,5,B000FC2HRC,"National Geographic's ""The Gospel of Judas"" is the documentary companion to the books the Society has recently published concerning this recently rediscovered ancient text that purports to tell the story of Judas Iscariot, traditionally the Great Betrayer of the New Testament, from a decidedly different view.  The story of the discovery of the text, its appearance and disappearance on the antiquities market, and its ultimate restoration and translation is itself quite fascinating.

The Gospel of Judas is believed to be a late 3rd century Coptic manuscript copy of an earlier Greek original that probably dates to around the middle of the 2nd century.  The documentary chronicles the story of the text from its suppression by orthodox Christians to its rediscovery in the 1970s by grave robbers in southern Egypt.  The papyrus manuscript, literally falling to pieces during years of poor handling and lack of preservation, finds its way into the hands of a Swiss antiquities dealer who, after several failed attempts to sell it for big bucks, made a deal with National Geographic to preserve, restore, and translate the codex.

The film also makes extensive and effective use of dramatizations that highlight some of the rather controversial subject matter contained in the Judas Gospel that suggests that Judas, far from being the evil betrayer depicted in the canonical gospels, was actually the greatest of Jesus' disciples.  Here, Judas is told by Jesus himself to turn him over to the Romans for execution so as to fulfill his ultimate destiny as Messiah and savior.  It is important to keep in mind that the Gospel of Judas was deliberately excluded from the orthodox Bible because of its Gnostic teachings, something that connects it to the Nag Hammadi texts discovered in Egypt in 1945.  Many of these texts, like the Judas Gospel, were hidden away so that they would not be destroyed by fanatical rival Christian factions that sought to obliterate Gnostic texts that they considered heretical.  Though most scholars reject the idea that the Judas Gospel contains genuine historical revelations about Jesus or Judas, it does clearly show that there were many competing gospels that were used by different sects and factions of Christians vying for power and influence in the ancient world.

This documentary is a good introduction to this material and would be especially recommended to anyone interested in the history of religion and early Christianity.",1150675200,46,2468,5.209595959595959
2560457,5,B000FC2HRC,"This video was an excellent example of how religion cannot be trusted.

2560459,4,B000FC2HRC,"GENERAL ANALYSIS: This DVD gives clear information on how the codex was discovered, restored, translated, and dated with the radiocarbon method.  Some of the content is dramatized, which makes it more interesting to see.  It confirms the ancient date of the codex and suggests that it is highly probable that the content of this gospel is not historically reliable. Yet, the video finishes with a very postmodern note:  that religious belief has little to do with historical facts as it has to do with blind faith.

MAJOR MISLEADING NOTIONS: (1)The NT gospels have different accounts, therefore they contradict each other. (2) The NT portrait of Judas as a villain has led to Anti-semitism (3) Gnosticism was not heresy but a different legitimate face of early Christianity.

CONCLUSION: It is a good video to use for background information as well as to discuss the false postmodern assumption that Christian faith has little to do with historicity.",1149206400,7,950,5.103225806451613

2560486,2,B000FC2HRC,"National Geographic presents a documentary on the controversial gnostic gospel known as The Gospel Of Judas. It presents the backstory about how it was discovered,authenticated and the history behind it. It was analyzed by experts and scholars to provide an accurate story on what the content of the gospel which highlights a different view on Judas Iscariot with regards to the passion and death of Jesus and the events surrounding Christian history particularly during the time of Ireneaus, who himself condemned the said gospel in 180 A.D.

The documentary presents first how the gospel was discovered in the caves of Egypt. It highlights how it was stolen once and how it was kept hidden inside the vault for sixteen years that led to deterioration of its papyrus. Also,it narrates the story of how a former antiques dealer got possession of it and provided it to experts and scholars for its restoration and analyses. It was obvious the painstaking effort it needed for its restoration and how it was authenticated through carbon dating at the Physics Center of University of Arizona. It was evident that the newly found Gospel was authentic as it was carbon dated back to 280 plus/minus 60 years and it was written in coptic writing. It was indeed the same gospel that Ireneaus rallied against.

After its authenticated,the story it narrates was revealed to the viewers. It tells of a special relationship between Jesus and Judas Iscariot,the only apostle who best understood Jesus and his true teachings. Also,it provides unlikely character of Jesus like someone who laughs sardonically especially when his apostles fail to understand him. It also includes stories that are not in parallel with the other gospels in the Bible such as appearing as a child to his apostles for them to understand him more clearly. Finally,the act of betrayal made by Judas was made in obedience to Jesus' orders.

It was evident that National Geographic made an effort to validate it. Despite the fact that I commend its staff for authenticating it and proving it to be far from being archaeological forgery,I felt that it is trying to push it as another version of Christianity. The effort it made to somehow validate it by presenting other gnostic gospels that existed like the Gospels of Thomas,Mary Magdalene,Philip and many others. Despite the fact that the Gospel of Judas contains a lot of unlikely characters of Jesus like someone who laughs a lot and many others that are not found in the four gospels in the Bible,it somehow has scholars in it who tried to provide credibility to its content. Sad but true. Too bad that it made its viewers to give attention to what this gnostics are saying. As Dr. Elaine Pagels stated,""They called themselves Christians. Not gnostics"". Obviously,they are not gnostics but heretics.

In the end,there are more questions asked than answered at the end of the documentary especially when events in history are being re-interpreted particularly how the gospels were chosen when everyone familiar with Christian history knows exactly how the Council Of Nicea came about.",1445212800,,3098,5.033138401559454

2560521,1,B000FC2HRC,"I turned  this documentary off when it showed a devious Jesus laughing at the pious.  I found it revolting. This gospel is obviously the work of the demonic, was not inspired, and was properly rejected by the early church as an unreliable and inaccurate depiction of what really happened concerning Judas.

Though the complaint is often raised that the early church simply rejected anything that opposed a preconceived idea, this complaint falls short when we understand that the early church knew which documents were authored by the apostles and which were not.  God did not make a mistake when he led the Christian Church to recognize what is and is not inspired.  The Gospel of Judas was never recognized by the church as being inspired.

April D. DeConick's, ""The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says,"" gives a better interpretation of this gospel. She claims that Judas was a demon called the ""Thirteenth."" She also points out many other flaws in National Geographic's interpretation of this gospel.

In short, Judas is a frightening character, a ""daimon,"" according to this gospel, which means ""demon,"" and the one who betrayed God for a few coins. Instead, National Geographic attempted to manufacture a hero Judas in this documentary in order to put out something sensational.",1380585600,,1305,5.070093457943925

2560524,5,B000FC2HRC,"As we learn in this riveting documentary, there were originally over thirty gospels of Jesus, among them the Gospel of Judas.
The history of this ancient book, which is carbon dated from the year 280 AD plus or minus 50 years, is a fascinating story in itself.

There were many versions of Christianity in the early days after the death of Jesus.  Some sects placed emphasis on the Book of Thomas, others on the Book of Mary, and around the year 300 A.D. a Christian bishop took it upon himself to decide which books would be the ""official"" books of Christianity.  He chose Mathew, Mark Luke and John, which we learn were not actually written by these apostles.  They were written at a later date after their deaths.

This book, written in the ancient language of coptic, was a copy of another earlier book written in Greek, but this is the only copy that has survived.  And it survived just barely. It was rescued from sixteen years of disintegration in a safety deposit box in New York city by a woman collector of ancient documents.

The Book of Judas is at odds with the ""official"" Bible.  It describes Judas as a hero.  It says he was chosen by Jesus to turn him in to the Romans for crucifixion.  It ends with the seizing of Jesus by the Romans.  No mention is made of the crucifixion or resurection.  It seems that in this version of Jesus' life,  Jesus wanted to be rid of his earthly body so his devine soul could be free.

What to beleive..... Take your pick.... I personally want to have every possible document available about Jesus' life so I can make my own decisions.  Which account rings true to you?

I highly recommend this documentary to truth seekers, Christians, and anyone who wants to hear some other versions of what may have happened to Jesus.  Even atheists who love ancient history or documents can love this.

I urge everyone to watch this documentary. I found it an inspiration to my faith that indeed Jesus, whom I adore, was sent to bring us hope for everlasting life. I do not doubt the possibility of God sending many Saviors and storytellers into our midst, but I view Judas, the disciple, in an entirely different way; a man with a sincere dedication to our Lord; after watching this most excellent NG special.

Overall they do a decent job of giving a little bit of something for everyone: detective work, science in action, history, and religion.

This is a wonderful documentary on the history of the Gospel though.  I think the reenactments are a good thing; they are almost necessary.  I think anyone with an interest in Christianity or religion should pick this up and watch it.,1198972800,4,559,4.12962962962963
2560544,4,B000FC2HRC,"Judas Iscariot has always fascinated me, even as a child. I never believed that he was possessed by Satan and betrayed Jesus. In my own innocent way, I believed that Judas was meant to betray Jesus as part of His divine plan. The scriptures, centuries before Christ was born, told that the messiah would be betrayed. Then this leads us to two ideas, either we are predetermined in what we do and have no say in the matter (even though we think we know what we are doing), or Judas was told to do this by Jesus so the crucifiction and the resurrection could occur. The most chilling of all Bible quotes is when Jesus says ""Lo that the man would be better that he were never born, than to betray the Son of Man.""

In the Book of John it is said that Judas was possessed by Satan and betrayed Jesus, later hanging himself, and is now in the lowest pits of hell. If this is so, then doesn't it make sense that Judas has indeed paid the ultimate price for human redemption? Yes Jesus was crucified and was raised on the thrid day, but if Judas has been burning in hell for over 2000 years and will burn for eternity, didn't he suffer more for mankind?

It is this line of thinking that makes this subject so fascinating to me. If Judas was possessed by Satan and betrayed Jesus, Jesus would have already known this thrre years prior and allowed it to happen by letting Judas become a disciple.

This DVD does not tell as much about the contents of The Gospel of Judas as it does the history and restoration of the document itself. The document dates plus of minus 50 years from the year 280 AD and is 85% intact. The document was found be a fortune seeking farmer. It was sold in Egypt and then stolen. After the owner got it back he tried to sell it, but could not get the price he asked for. It then sat in a safety deposit box in New York for 16 years, causing much more damage to the document.

The DVD also talks about the Gnostics and how the early church did away with over 30 Gospels and decided that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were the only Books worthy of being in the Bible.

There are some very good re-enactments of Jesus and his disciples speaking in their native tongue. Also there is a bit on the Romans torturing and killing Christians. I had never heard of the 'hot seat' before as a torture device, but it looked very unpleasant.

If you want to read or know the actual contents of the Gospel of Judas, I suggest buying it and reading it yourself. This DVD concentrates most on the actual history of the document itself.",1197936000,5,2537,4.286012526096034
