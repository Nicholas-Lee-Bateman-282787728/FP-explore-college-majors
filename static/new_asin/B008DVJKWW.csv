5153442,5,B008DVJKWW,"Just so cute. What can we say? The littles love watching all the ""party"" videos from Animal Atlas.",1410998400,3,98,4.5
5153443,5,B008DVJKWW,She loves it. Cute animals for the whole duration. Very informative. Great way to introduce many different animals to your kids.,1395360000,3,128,5.142857142857143
5153444,5,B008DVJKWW,"I saw this video at a wine party some friends threw. They had this playing in the bedroom for kids but I sat through the whole thing. If you want to watch videos of animals, you will not be disappointed. My only criticism is that I found it implausible the talking puppy narrator has neighbors with so many varieties of animals, both domestic and wild. I mean, one neighbor has horses and another has a tree boa?! I quickly resuspended by disbelief, though.",1385078400,5,457,4.518072289156627

5153449,5,B008DVJKWW,Cute video - narrative moves along nicely going from pet type to pet type (dogs to cats to birds etc.)  Bought this for a senior with dementia and it always puts a smile on her face.  I found other videos provide too much verbal information on the animals and get boring.  This video has very cute active animals and provides a good hour of entertainment - even if the watcher dozes off - you can easily pick up watching at any point.,1469664000,3,434,4.2682926829268295
5153450,5,B008DVJKWW,My two year old is obsessed with this dvd. She loves all of the animals and the fact that it's narrorated by a dog instead of a person. We watch it at least 3 tines a day.,1467244800,,171,3.6486486486486487

5153455,2,B008DVJKWW,It really didn't keep my daughters attention. And she loves animals. It was slow,1464739200,,80,4.785714285714286
5153456,3,B008DVJKWW,"Grandsons seemed to enjoy it, which was the reason for the purchase. Wasn't very action packed, very low key. But lots of cute pets!",1463443200,,132,4.541666666666667

5153461,3,B008DVJKWW,3yo daughter likes it ok but it doesn't hold her attention. It is just a lot of quick clips of animals doing nothing special.,1435536000,,125,4.25
5153462,5,B008DVJKWW,Good as expected,1430524800,,16,4.666666666666667
5153463,3,B008DVJKWW,"If you've seen one of these pet party videos (and there are a couple streaming on Netflix), you've basically seen them all.  Close-ups of cute animals playing while a guy with a sort of Zach Braff-ish voice narrates as if he were one of the animals.  It's cute and it's something safe and not annoying to pop up on the TV for your little one.  My daughter, who is 2, doesn't really ask for it, though, so I guess it doesn't hold her attention that much.  It's more for background, I think, especially after you've watched it once.  My son, who is 7, might have enjoyed it more if I had it when he was little as he's more into animals than my daughter is.",1428883200,,654,4.2
5153464,5,B008DVJKWW,This is a very nice and inexpensive DVD that can be used for both small children and to entertain your dog for a period of time.  My pug watches this DVD very intently and gets excited when certain animals appear on the screen.  It is nice but not over stimulating.,1418860800,3,265,4.28

8527038,5,B008DVJKWW,It's a fun DVD that kids will enjoy or animal lovers. I use it for my dog for separation anxiety and it has helped her a lot.,1490227200,,125,3.6666666666666665

8527045,3,B008DVJKWW,"My child enjoys the first 15-20 minutes of the video with the puppies and then I watch his interest slowly decline bit by bit after that into the rest of the video with the other animals until eventually he stops watching after the kittens, some wildlife, birds, etc. He's a 1.5 year old toddler so I get that his attention span for some things won't be high. He had no interest in the reptiles and insects. LoL  For the animals that he did enjoy watching (puppies, birds, etc) he kept trying to grab them off the tv screen. Which I thought was so cute and funny. He might appreciate the video as he gets older.",1476489600,,611,4.3130434782608695
8527046,5,B008DVJKWW,We really enjoy this. It is fun to watch together as a family or something to just put on in the background.,1476403200,,108,3.9545454545454546
