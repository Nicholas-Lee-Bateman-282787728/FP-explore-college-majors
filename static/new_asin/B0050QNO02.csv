8451750,3,B0050QNO02,"This series is on the ID Network, which has alot of good shows. Nightmare Next Door tells stories about murders that take place from people that live next door. I thought I was getting a full season but this is just five hand picked stories. I'm not into a complete freak so I don't know what seasons they take place. It's a good show but if you want a complete season, look elsewhere. I don't know if they'll release full sets but this is a good way to have some epsiodes if you do enjoy the series.",1315526400,4,500,4.164948453608248
