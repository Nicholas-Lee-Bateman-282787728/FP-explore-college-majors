7036111,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"Why is the the Standard dvd Format
Even if this was the Complete Series 1-7 Blu Ray Box Set it would be super over Priced
But, i must admit I'd easily pay $150.00 for A Mentalist Complete Series BR Box Set
Not worth it (Just buy each Season when they are on sale either through Amazon, WB.com, or even Wal Mart
You can actually get the first Season on Pure HD w/ Season One Blu Ray (for around $20.00) During Sales
another Massive minus is Season 1-5 Have little to no extras which suck
I Love The Mentalist But, this is just WB  nickel and diming  the fan base Nothing more nothing less
You can also watch the show from the jump on TNT HD  (This series was shot in HD watching it in SD kind of sucks 'Cause you are losing the Complete Vision of the Director/Creator
Who knows if we'll ever get a BR Set of the Series from Season 2-7  (But, Bloody Friends gets a BR Box Set I honestly doubt they Remastered Friends in HD for the Blu Ray versions  WB just upconverted it to save $
Once again amazing tv Series from the Guy who is now writing/ executive producer for FOX's Massive Hit GOTHEM
If you love Murder Mystery, Unique Cop Shows by all means support it (But, save your money and build the Collection Season by Season)

7036112,4,B00UCJ6TPE,"In general, it's been entertaining with interesting characters.  Unfortunately in Season 3, Disc 2 would not play on any of my devices.  I am returning it and hopeful I find no more defective discs.",1522022400,,198,4.794117647058823
7036113,2,B00UCJ6TPE,It's been about a month since I have bought The Mentalist set. Seasons 1 through 3 are in pretty good conditions with no scratches on them. For some reason on season 4 disc 4 it is unreadable to watch any of the episodes. Season 5 was in pretty good condition now I'm starting season 6 in the first disc has a couple of deep scratches hopefully the DVD player can read them if not I will further my review. Hopefully season 7 will have no scratches on them so I can watch all the discs and finish the Mentalist set.,1521158400,,515,4.16

7036126,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"My daughter and I loved the series when it was on the air.  Simon Baker is real easy on the eyes and the show itself was pretty interesting, especially the team trying to capture the serial killer ""Red John"".  But, once the team moved to Texas to work for the FBI the series had a different feel.  Jane was more aggressive, Lisbon was more feminine, Cho was still the ""Ice Man"" and sadly Van Pelt and Riggs being happily married left the group only to appear in a few episodes.  I still like watching the show once in a while because I seem to know most of the episodes by heart, so I will put it away for a while and watch it again in a year or so.",1509580800,,649,4.007751937984496

The reveal and resolution of the Red John arc is far better than most TV police shows.",1508716800,2,292,3.9322033898305087
7036131,1,B00UCJ6TPE,I paid $60 a season on DVD now it's 115$ for the whole series? Good thing the series ended I will never ever do that again.,1507766400,,123,3.769230769230769
7036132,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"Simon Baker was wonderful in his portrayal of The Mentalist. Patrick Jane is funny, smart, sexy, and flawed. I love that. Aside from being just a very well written show, did I also mention that Simon Baker has a smile that could stop traffic! This is the most that I have ever paid for a box set. But it was worth it. This is something that I will watch again at some point. Just a side note: It's always funny to me when a British or Australian actor portrays an American. Every once in awhile you can detect little subtle nuances in his diction that remind you that he's Australian...like when he pronounces the word strawberry on one of the episodes. Very cute!",1507680000,3,664,4.40650406504065

7036137,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"One of the coolest, best TV crime shows EVER (imho).  There'd never been a series like this before, and I doubt will be again.  It's not the typical, uber-gritty, car-chase, shoot-'em-up we've all seen before.  And, while The Mentalist certainly has its share of heavy, dark, suspense (and in some cases, *terror*)-filled moments, it's also loaded with quirky, goofy, oddball, unexpected humor.  The first 10 minutes tell you this show -- and its characters -- is different.  Mainly because of Simon Baker: it definitely was *his* show.
I was snared from the first previews in Summer '08, and utterly hooked from the Pilot to the series finale.",1501459200,2,644,4.981308411214953
7036138,4,B00UCJ6TPE,"The series is very well-written and quite intriguing.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the faulty discs in (I believe) Season 2.  They appeared to have been recorded during a serious storm..
Otherwise, love The Mentalist!  I met the real guy behind the show's writing when I was in Las Vegas.  He is talented and intriguing.",1500768000,,329,4.52542372881356

7036178,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"A beautiful boxset for an amazing series.

The box came a little dented, as well as a few seasons box sleeves were damaged, but I didn't mind since i was going to keep the sleeves in the box and move the disks to my dvd organizer.

Each season was better than the last in my opinion. The quality of the disks are great. No scratches, I was worried when my dvd player skipped, but its because the player is old. I just needed to take it out and put the disk back in, it was fine.

The only thing I wish was that the series was available for Blu-Ray, other than that I love the set. I have recommended this set to other fans of the series and luckily theres wasn't damaged like mine. I have included photos of the set because the ones provided do not give it justice.

PS Do not buy unless it is under $100. I bought it for $82, rather than the $125 originally. Just keep your eye on the price.",1469318400,20,892,4.051136363636363

7036200,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"I just discovered I did not review each season though I  of course will I say  watched them all year after year starting in 2008.

The series is entirely centered on one character, Patrick Jane, an Australian whose wife and young daughter were assassinated by a serial killer in Texas, Red John. Patrick Jane is in no way an FBI agent but he becomes a consultant because he has a high level of deductive power and he is extremely talented at reading the mind of people through their behaviors, their attitudes, their face expressions, and all other bodily signs. He knows a liar when he meets one and is never wrong, or at least or at most hardly ever.

The series as a whole is interesting from beginning to end because of the evolution of Patrick Jane who will keep up with chasing Red John till he catches him and that will take at least six years to do so. When that Red John is out, when Patrick Jane is finally avenged, when he finally gets justice he can start relaxing and that is the most difficult part since from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder he has to shift to a relaxed and unstressed behavior, to being a normal man looking for happiness and letting bygones finally be bygones since they have been taken care of. And thats the seventh and last year. Like god he can rest on his seventh season.

This series is strange in many ways because it has a very regular one episode one case or one case one episode, and yet there are logics and dynamics that run from one season to the next, from one episode to the next, at times even to the two or three next ones. This long-running architecture is rare in such criminal series that can last for decades if necessary, meaning if the audience sticks to it. But this one lost its long term logic in its last season. So they had to finish it.

It is a common fact that series are terminated after a decent number of years. I can think of Prison Break, Dexter, Queer as Folk, Lost, Breaking Bad, Babylon 5, House MD. That is not a final and complete list. CSI Miami also found an end in 2012 though other CSI branches like Las Vegas or New York lasted a couple more years to finally give way to CSI Cyber in 2015. The ends are very varied and in this particular case it was even rather delicate. They only got one casualty, and it was the last arrived agent. They avoided the massacre of everyone. But the unit had to be disbanded, at least somewhat to make an end possible.

The boss is just moving to Washington DC, following his wife who becomes deputy Secretary of Commerce. Kimball Cho will take over and will have to rebuild the team. A candidate for a transfer is friendly ordered to stay put. But then what may happen to Patrick Jane and Teresa Lisbon? Thats for you to discover. But after Patrick Janes finally getting free of his OCD, a smooth, sweet and happy ending is possible, with a little bit of suspense, that is to say.

The great positive point of this series is that Patrick Jane is not a psychic and he does not believe in it. He is a deductive mind that can observe details and deduct a lot from them. Then the rest is poker bluffing based on guessing when there is a hole in the deduction? Bluffing is the best thing you can imagine and it can pay big money. In most of Patrick Janes cases it enables him to catch the killers one after the other. At times it is difficult and even dangerous but we are in a series, so the outcome is what you may expect, though you may expect many things and only one will happen.

The nicest and most Hollywoodian element is that Patrick Jane falls in love with a few things and one person. I can tell you about the things: a cabin first by a lake second with a few ducks third and a nice trailer fourth, which is a lot better than some kind of secret storing space in the FBI building. As for the person it is both surprising and natural so that we can end up with a wedding party, a kidnapped judge and a serial killer as prime guest, without speaking of the stow-away that will take a few months to reveal himself. Have a good session with this Mentalist who is no psychic because he does not believe in psychic, spirits and any other world beyond the surface of things, no matter how cruel and brutal things can be.

7036205,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"Arrived today, right on time, and it looks great! I know a lot of reviewers were bringing up the price as a reason not to buy, or to buy individual seasons, but I was fortunate to get this at 50% off and that works out to about $15 a season. The latest season retails at $40 and the Amazon price is $25, so I saved money in the long run =). As for the show itself, I am really thrilled to have found it and be the proud owner of seven high quality seasons, all nicely packaged in a boxed set. This is quite a looker, it would make a great gift. I highly recommend this for any Mentalist lovers!",1446595200,5,594,3.9583333333333335

7036210,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"I never missed an episode while it was on T.V., hated to see it go, but it was time before they got too fantastical with their cases. It was already a stretch getting all of the main Characters from a fictional California police force, into the F.B.I.. This is one of those series I hope my friends with younger children will enjoy when they are adults, many years from now.
It was fun to watch the main character ""Patrick Jane"", solve cases using his lifetime of Carny Honed skills and Mental Tricks. Fantastical, by all means, but exceedingly watchable every week just the same.
A nice little tid-bit, one of Patrick's antagonists, about 3/4 of the way through the series, who played a recurring role in several episodes, is now one of the main characters in the Police Drama ""Murder in the First"". She earned this part by playing an excellent antagonist in the Mentalist. Easy on the eyes and very smart, I hope they don't get stupid with her part and make her one of the bad guys, which happens when they run out of fresh ideas for episodes. NOTE TO WRITERS, if you need help, CALL ME. I own over 5,000 hours of Movies and T.V., (mostly purchased on Amazon) and I know how to fix a script when writers seem to be getting either STUCK or STALE.
Anyway, if they do a Movie Version of the Mentalist or a made for T.V. special, it would most likely be worth watching if they kept the same writing and directing teams together.",1436054400,7,1426,4.425855513307985
7036211,5,B00UCJ6TPE,"You can buy each season seperately and save yourself $60. Great show, but not worth spending that much to have them all boxed together.",1434931200,8,135,4.666666666666667
