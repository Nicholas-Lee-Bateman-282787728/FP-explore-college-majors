7819484,4,6301986482,"This is an interesting Peanuts episode in that it explores painful realities.

It pretty much begins with Snoopy coming to Charlie Brown with the news that he is planning to get married. He met a French Poodle; they had a romantic evening, and they have decided that they should get married. Charlie Brown, Woodstock, and Sally are of course shocked. Linus wonders if Snoopy will move away or if his wife and in laws will come to live with Charlie Brown. Snoopy of course is in a mesmerized state, and can not to be talked to.

Carrying out Snoopy's request, Charlie sends an invitation to Snoopy's brother Spike. Spike (who kind of has a resemblance to Liam Neeson) happily accepts the invitation. Snoopy is delighted that his brother has made it to the wedding, and the Peanuts gang starts to decide how they will divide the wedding duties. Charlie, Linus, Sally, Lucy, Patty, and Marcy actually work it out well.

At the bachelor's party, Schroeder kind of gives Snoopy cold feet with some poorly chosen words: ""No more root beer parties; here's to the end of youth and innocence."" This is when the tables start to turn. On the morning of his wedding, Snoopy refuses to get out of bed, and Charlie has to tell him that it's a little late to back out now. The once love mesmerized Snoopy is full of terror as he is dragged to the very wedding he chose. (Interesting reality!)

I don't want to give away the ending, but it is interesting how the end is neither especially happy nor sad. We just can sense that it was probably the best for everyone.

Overall, this is a great Peanuts episode with a lot of realism.",1224201600,,1614,4.5326460481099655
