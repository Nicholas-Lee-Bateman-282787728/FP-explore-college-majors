173570,5,0970567200,"This is one of the first DVDs I have purchased, and I was not disappointed. Having recently taken an Amtrak round-trip from New York to New Orleans, I felt like I was back on this remarkable adventure. The  quality of the photography, graphics, and content is superb. If Amtrak  isn't offering this DVD in their on-line giftshop, they should be! This is  a must-see for anyone who has never taken a long-distance train trip. There  is no better way to see America, and this lovingly crafted DVD proves it. I  highly recommend it to anyone who loves travel and trains.",950486400,5,567,4.63
173571,5,0970567200,"Outstanding presentation! A glorious trip for train buffs or scenery watchers. Take a trip form the east coat to the west coast, stopping at smaller tourist-style railroads along the way. A can't-miss Christmas gift!",939513600,,216,5.382352941176471
173572,5,0970567200,"Wonderful scenery, great trains all arranged with a wonderful music score.  This is truly a treasure for any DVD collection.  A great job of blending our great country with nature and interesting side trips to small  railroads.  Highly recommended!",937180800,,248,5.282051282051282

7794211,5,0970567200,This was a gift for my nephew who loves trains.  I currently have the same one and my two son's have loved watching it.  Arrived on time.,1420416000,,137,4.037037037037037
7794212,3,0970567200,"Southern California sites receive some attention.

I liked the Orange Empire RR Museum scenes, with the Pacific Electric car. We should have kept that route. Sad to say, it was gone by the early 1960s. You can see one of the few remaining PE cars in this film. Knotts Berry Farm has two old authentic steam locomotives, brought to Knotts in 1952, as one of their first tourist attractions. They are working engines from the old Denver, Rio Grande, and Western (or Southern) line. Engine 340, built by Baldwin in Philadelphia, 1881, runs daily. Engine 41 runs when 340 is in for repair. The engineers at Knotts were trained by the former DRG and W engineers, and are happy to tell you about their work.

Another area site, Angels Flight in L.A., received only a few seconds of footage. This short line (very short!) ran for 67 years before moving. It deserved more than a few seconds. Huell Howser found it worth an hour program, and Michael Connelly wrote an entire book-- Angels Flight.

If you like to look at operating passenger trains, you will like this film.",1369526400,,1064,4.648936170212766
7794213,4,0970567200,Presentation does a great job of documenting Flagler's efforts to make transportation available from Miami to Key West.  It makes a trip down US 1 a trip into history as you pass landmarks and appreciate the effort of thousands and the loss of life that went into making this possible.,1363219200,,285,4.7
7794214,1,0970567200,I thought this video was terrible. I could not believe most of the video was taken from a camera pointed out the side or back of the train and turned on to record. The only good part of this video was the archived footage from the steam locomotives that were included in. This video can not keep the attention of my four year old son who loves trains. I clearly expected better.,1120089600,4,378,4.263888888888889
7794215,5,0970567200,"After Receiving this video as a gift on Christmas 1994, I watched this video more than once to get a feel of what it was like to travel cross country by rail from Washington DC to San Francisco, first aboard the Capitol Limited (that now uses the bi-level Superliner cars) and then aboard the famous California Zephyr. As you should see in this video, the landscape changes all the time. I had the opportunity to ride the California Zephyr roundtrip from Emeryville, CA to Denver, departing midmorning back in May 1998 together with an old high school friend who is a real rail buff (actually, we both are) to see the beauty of the landscape ourselves and take lots of photos. On the eastbound trip - not shown on the video since the trains were traveling west and at night - the train we were on that early next morning was traversing some of the most spectacular scenery between Provo, UT and Green River, UT where the train ascends a range on winding track and then descends into a beautiful canyon skirting alongside the banks of the Price River. Here we were traveling through many tunnels and, after a brief stop in Helper, UT, we continued onto Green River, UT (the trains do not stop in Thompson, UT anymore). We also enjoyed the majestic beauty of the Rocky Mountains. After  more than thirteen minutes of subterranian running through the Moffat Tunnel we were able to see Denver off in the distance while winding our way down the Front Range, reaching Denver that evening, and staying there for two nights before returning to Emeryville on the westbound train (which was three hours late, but we didn't complain) to see the beauty again. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who would like to see this vast, great country of ours at ""see"" level instead of at 35,000 feet in the air.",1072137600,4,1801,4.610591900311526
7794216,5,0970567200,"This DVD is amazing, one of the top DVD I archived (70+).
The DVD is 3+ hours long, consist of the 2 volumes of VHS counterpart in one. The sound quality is great, picture quality 4.
Different from many travel video, in which the comentators are speaking with commercial speed (some indeed try to squeeze in as much commercial as possible), this video just has few comments where there is a need, the rest (much of the time) , it leaves you just enjoy the passing scene (accompanied by music right for the mood).
It is very landscape oriented, you reaaly feel you are a passenger with peaceful mind.
Volume 1: heartland america, from Washington DC to Sanfrancisco, great landscape w/ vastness views, 2 hours+
Volume 2: west cost, from San Diego to Seattle, great pacific coast views plus Yosemite etc, 1 hour",1046390400,,808,4.6573426573426575
7794217,5,0970567200,This is my very first DVD and I'm so glad I chose this one to be my first disc. I found this DVD to be very good and I really got my moneys worth on it. I found both train presentaions to be excellent and it was a first rate  job all the way not only was the nairration great but I also enjoyed the  great train footage that was filmed. It's the best I have ever seen. If  your a rail faan or just enjoy trains in general then this DVD is for you.  That's all I have to say.,956966400,2,474,3.6633663366336635
7794218,4,0970567200,"We may be zone 4 for DVD and PAL television (not NTSC) but we have our methods of beating the system.
Found this to be a great introduction to Amtrak services with great views of the US countryside and informative  commentary.  Particularly liked the fact that where the scenery or train  dominated the screen the narration stopped.  Very rare in this type of  program.
The side excursions on preserved lines were interesting and  whetted the appetite to try them myself.
Having always intended to tour  the US and Canada by rail I can only say keep lobbying your government to  keep Amtrak funded - its an asset worth keeping.
Also purchased 'Travel  the World by Train - North America' (don't bother) and The Great  Trans-American Ride (not bad).",951350400,5,748,4.7734375
