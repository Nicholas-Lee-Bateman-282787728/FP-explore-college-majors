8324297,5,B00006JDRM,"I totally love htis movie. It's hilarious and action packed that you won't be bored for a single second. Be sure to check out the 1st and 4th instalment of the series. Third one really sux.

Watch out if you want an subtitled version. Even though the description says so, this is an DUBBED one WITHOUT SUBTITLES. Boo for amazon this time.",1140393600,2,338,4.451612903225806
8324298,5,B00006JDRM,"I have been trying to get a copy of this movie for at least 15 years now and the fact that it is now coming out on DVD is why I love this format . The movie is a funny spoof of spy movies with amazing action and truly one of a kind gadgets . The series also has a famous villian in every installment , in this one it is the clint eastwood character from the good ,the bad  ,the ugly (or at least a lookalike) . This movie is for kids and adults alike and especially for fans of spys and gadgets . I won't be buying it but only because I am buying the whole collection .",1031788800,,569,3.7416666666666667
