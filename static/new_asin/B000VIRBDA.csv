2942190,4,B000VIRBDA,"I have watched this video and think that it is very informative. I have been butchering my own deer for a couple of years now, but after watching this video and using what he showed in this video I definitely get a lot for meat off of each deer. I agree with what the others have posted about them trying to sell the Outdoor Edge Knives through out the video and he does repeat himself a lot. But,to his defense this is a teaching tool and sometimes we need repetitiveness for stuff to sink in, well I know I do at least. All and all I think this is a great video for showing someone how to properly field dress and butcher a deer whether you are an experienced deer hunter or a beginner. I only gave this four stars because I also would have liked to learned more about the aging process. I would highly recommend this video to anyone interested in butchering their own deer.",1301184000,,876,4.251497005988024
2942191,3,B000VIRBDA,"The video has tons of good info. He explains it very well. I wish he went in to more detail on aging meat. But overall very informative video on the process of your game.  BUT!!!!
With all the (commercials) I call them commercials because he is trying to sell you on their cutlery at every turn of the video. Its quite annoying. This video should be free. Otherwise it should be renamed to look at my knives they cut meat.
If they are gonna sell this video keep the infomercial out of it IMHO.",1296345600,4,493,4.24468085106383
2942192,4,B000VIRBDA,"I've done close to 10 hours of research on deer hunting and processing using various books, and multiple internet resources.  I'm currently twenty five minutes into this video and I must say...its got all the right information, but unless you are a fifth grader it is difficult to watch.  It's way over-the-top with his instruction and constant advertisements for this ""awesome knife that's gonna revolutionize...blah blah."" Seriously, I want to turn it off.  however, I have never cleaned a deer.  I'm listening to what he's saying, and I feel that if I can make it to the end off this video, I will be a better deer processor.  If you graduated highschool and can handle a pair of scissors (or an awesome knife) without causing yourself to bleed out, you might find this difficult to watch too.",1295395200,,796,4.781021897810219
2942193,4,B000VIRBDA,"This DVD delivers on its title. It starts with field dressing and moves through butchering game. The production values are sufficient for the topic but not great (hence four stars, not five). You start out with a qualified butcher in a white garage-like room with a whitetail on the cement floor. The camera angle will change to help you follow the process and sometimes there's a picture-in-picture effect. It felt more like a well done home project most of the time. But that's a criticism that may be true of the majority of instructional videos (in my experience).
The video does a great job of anticipating that you might want to know the difference between processing a trophy animal (with taxidermy in mind) versus one harvested for meat. The whole process is on video so nothing is left to the imagination. This can become a little tedious (such as when skinning stoke by  stroke) but you can't say the video isn't thorough or conclusive. The instructor is a butcher and it shows. He describes the meat in terms of traditions cuts. He talks some about aging the meat and is also careful about sanitation, giving necessary pointers along the way. He also emphasizes safety. The brief section on how to go into the upper chest cavity with two hands, knife in one, will be repeated by me with friends every time that I'm with them dressing game.
I got tired of the Outdoor Edge ""infomercial"" feel at points. If you're not familiar, they make very good game knives and processing tools (including kits). I came to this video after purchasing their Swingblade (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outdoor-Edge-Swingblaze-SZ-20N-SwingBlade-with-Bright-Orange-Handle-Never-Lose-Your-Knife-Again/dp/B001E8G4NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outdoor Edge Swingblaze SZ-20N SwingBlade with Bright Orange Handle Never Lose Your Knife Again</a>) at a local sporting goods store. You'll hear more than enough about this and a couple of more of the products in the field dressing segment to make you want one--or make you wish they'd quit pushing it since you've already paid for the DVD and didn't want an informercial.
This DVD could have added ""Made Easy"" to their title. It really is that informative and step-by-step. You'll find that a simple set of tools and some practice could give you a better processed--and even better tasting (as the video gives tips on this along the way from not contaminating the meat to aging it and better use of cuts)--game animal experience.",1291420800,15,2502,5.239401496259352
2942203,5,B000VIRBDA,Very good video. Has very good information on processing a deer. Now I wish I had a set up like he had in the video!,1414454400,,116,3.68
2942204,5,B000VIRBDA,"Best video out there on field dressing and butchering deer.  If you don't have someone to show you the ropes in person, but you want more than can be shown in books, this is the video you want.  I will be purchasing the remainder of the series.",1412899200,,244,4.170212765957447
2942205,3,B000VIRBDA,"The quality of the video and sound in particular is far from todays common HD. Its like an old VHS transferred to a DVD. All of that nit picking aside, I did gain some knowledge. Definitely a trick or two that I've since used and shared. Its of course up to the individual to determine that. I've cleaned Deer, Elk Caribou and a few others so I've had a little experience prior to watching this and I still had a few Ahhhh thats pretty cool, not a bad idea moments. But most of it overall is pretty basic stuff if you have had any history cleaning game. The meat processing part would probably be of most value if you've never done any of that yourself.",1398038400,5,653,4.232
2942206,3,B000VIRBDA,"While I found the information on the DVD to be useful, the overall production quality I thought was mediocre and a little sloppy. While viewing the part of DVD on field dressing, skinning, etc. It is not divided into chapters. So, from the main menu, you choose ""Play Video"" and then you have to watch it all the way through, you cannon skip sections or watch another section over again very easily. If you do want to skip around, you have to just fast forward or reverse. There should be better chapter/sub-chapter divisions so I can get to skinning or caping or butchering quickly and easily.

A couple of other notes, I noticed that they shot the guy doing the demo from multiple angles at once, which is good, except when they cut them together, the sound doesn't always match what he is saying or doing. There are even some section were the video is low quality and out of focus.

The gentleman giving the demo is very repetitive, to the point of being annoying. He also talks about/sells the knives he is using over and over again. I didn't know I was buying an infomercial.

Overall, just ok. Not as professional as I had expected.

Also, my case was taped shut with scotch tape and the folded up paper in site was loose with a piece of tape on it. I suspect that this was not brand new.",1395878400,2,1294,4.401673640167364
2942207,1,B000VIRBDA,"Granted, this only cost $15 so don't expect professional quality - it would made a good You Tube Video.

There are some really good tips that you can learn/pick up, but they are selling their product (that's OK, I knew that), but the DVD is not searchable,I find this to be MOST annoying -  you can't' get to the processing part without watching the field caping for a trophy buck part. or two OTHER parts.....parts of beginning sequences are in B/W, part of one segment, where they are processing a hindquater- the sound is so bad - sounds like it was recorded in big hollow auditorium...the sound is so bad in one sequence, that you could hear someone flush a toilet in the background! Maybe they are not selling enough knves to use at least a semi-professional videographer.

Since it's not searchable, it 's not worth the money - to me. There are too many free demos on You Tube...and there you don't mid hearing a toliet flush because you know it's someone's garage...not in a professional processing shop!!..

Save you're $15 on this DVD and go buy a new pair of hunting socks...you'll be better off.

This video turned me off so much due to the bad formatting and not being able to search and the random ""commercials"" of thier knives and dry rubs, that I will not be purchasing any of there other products...

Caveat emplor!!",1387756800,2,1332,4.57563025210084
2942208,5,B000VIRBDA,Very good step by step instructions from field dressing to skinning to butchering.  Also addresses how to cape a trophy.,1383609600,,120,5.0
2942209,5,B000VIRBDA,Processing your own deer is easier than you may think.  You just have to take your time and it will save you money.  Just processed a deer this past weekend.  Took 2.5 hrs from skinning it to cleaning up everything after vacuum sealing all the meat.  Getting a deer processed in MN cost anywhere from $200-300 depending on what you get made.  Save your money!,1381276800,2,359,4.461538461538462
2942210,4,B000VIRBDA,"This DVD gives good detail and information on the different cuts and their uses, but I feel like if you purchase an instructional DVD, you should not have to watch all of their knife pitches.  This DVD is half information, and half infomercial.  Does not cover field quartering.",1379635200,3,278,4.770833333333333

2942212,5,B000VIRBDA,"Great dvd to step a novice through field dressing, skinning, quartering, and butchering deer.  It's a little focused on the Outdoor Edge equipment, but then again they did put the video out, so they can be forgiven for having a few ""infomercial"" minutes throughout the film.  A great learning tool all around.",1355011200,,309,4.923076923076923
2942223,5,B000VIRBDA,"If you are looking for an informative education in big game processing, then this video is for you.
Brad Lockwood seems to be a good, down to earth guy, that loves hunting and processing.
Afetr watching this video, and then watching some good ole' boys at the club prepping their animal for further processing, I was amazed at all the things they did wrong. I watched a guy gut two deer and he penetrated the internal organs on both. Yuck!
Oh well, at least I know what to do now.",1338249600,,480,4.344444444444444
2942224,4,B000VIRBDA,Not as good as the second one but I still really like it and I think its a must for everyone to watch that's going to go out and harvest there own animal.,1330128000,,154,3.696969696969697
2942225,5,B000VIRBDA,"If you have absolutely no idea on how to field dress, skin, butcher and age meat then watch this video.

2942228,4,B000VIRBDA,"I've been processing my own deer for 15 years so I'm familiar with the basics.  Still, every year I think I should be able to do faster and more efficiently so I bought this DVD to prepare for this year's deer season.  This video has a lot of great information and I'm pretty confident that after watching it a few times I should be able to cut my processing time in half and end up with higher quality product, overall.  I'd recommend it to everyone from beginners to veterans, however, you have to be patient with the host.  He knows his stuff when it comes to meat processing but he also loves to talk...and talk...and talk.  If you can get beyond the sometimes repetitive and seemingly endless monologue, this DVD will help you get more meat from your deer in a much more efficient manner.",1321315200,5,793,4.441379310344828
2942229,5,B000VIRBDA,"I bought this DVD 4 years ago thinking that it would be nice to know how to do this myself and was very surprised at the level of detail and information I got. I watch this video every year before heading out to make sure that I remember what to do and where to make the cuts to get the most out of my game animal. The tips and tricks are easy to follow and after harvesting an animal I watch each of the sections about how to process each part of the animal before doing it, to be fresh and confident which has resulted in me getting the best results from my Elk.
I recommend this video to anyone hunting big game and after watching this, I am the person that my friends ask to come hunting with them because I know what I am doing and I am fast at getting it done. I can usually get the dead elk dressed and the hide opened up and loaded into the truck in less than 30 minutes. Fast dress time, quick cooling, and proper handling make the Elk in my house hard to distinguish between Beef and Elk. Most of my friends and family can not tell the difference. Stop paying for a processor to do a quick job on your big game animal when it's so easy to do and tastes a lot better.",1316995200,,1176,3.98728813559322

8218900,5,B000VIRBDA,I really like the way this video was done. It starts with skinning and then proceeds on to the butchering. The sections are broken down by the different cuts and what each cut can be used for. Definitely a must have if you plan to do your own processing.,1490400000,,254,4.204081632653061

8218908,2,B000VIRBDA,"The video is pretty good on instructional information but too much advertising of knife products.  It came in a pretty  flimsy cardboard package  - not a box but similar to an envelope.  Also beware that I purchased this video and it is the same exact video of a different title - ""Deer Processing 101"" - see attached picture.  Seems deceptive to me?",1415836800,2,350,4.580645161290323
