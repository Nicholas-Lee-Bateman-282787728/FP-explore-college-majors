2394675,5,B000AV2GF6,"Like i said in the title, these DVDs are essential to an up and coming artist. Being able to see how an artist works and thinks in the 20th century has changed the way i work and think. If you are an artist or an art historian and you havnt seen this series, then you need to. If you are an art professor, show this to you students  it will be one of the greatest things you ever do for their career.",1157846400,8,400,3.8780487804878048
2394676,5,B000AV2GF6,This whole series is just awesome. I first caught it on PBS and was hooked. It's so cool listening to artists and their mindset as well as projects they done. I also had a few 'wow' moments when a few of them had done projects I had thought I might like to do. The price to own the seasons is perfect.,1385769600,,301,3.9508196721311477
2394677,5,B000AV2GF6,Art 21 is always great! I love seeing and hearing from the artists in the video series. I own them all.,1362096000,,103,3.9523809523809526
2394678,5,B000AV2GF6,"Great review of Contemporary Art, Artists, and Art-making strategies.
I will return to these videos for inspiration over and over again.
Great information for art students and art courses.",1356998400,,188,5.517241379310345
2394679,1,B000AV2GF6,"I was amazed that these artists made it to a show on television.  The work was boarderline awful.  The only interesting artist was the glass artist, I thought his work was well done.  Most of the other artists were on a par with elementary school children, young elemtary school children.  One artist went to the dollar store to buy colored plastic containers to hammer onto her art.  Yuck!",1324598400,,390,4.676470588235294
2394680,5,B000AV2GF6,"I've been using the PBS Art21 Series in my Art Appreciation and Introduction to Visual Arts classes for about four years now.  There is no other tool I have that can make this subject as engaging as this series of interviews. Teaching in small towns in the midwest presents a particular challenge in finding nearby galleries or artists' studios to visit for a ""live"" interaction... so these fill that void.  AND the best part - [...] has a substantial amount of teaching materials to go along with the videos!
Beyond that, I just find this series to be extremely inspirational and informative, being an artist myself.",1234310400,9,617,4.811320754716981
2394681,2,B000AV2GF6,"I'm not sure what others who reviewed this DVD saw. Were we watching the same monologues? I'm very disappointed in this purchase. I was looking for innovation, creativity and technical skill among contemporary artists and perhaps some gems of wisdom they can share with the rest of us. I've taught art for thirty years, inspiring others to consider art as a career. If many of these people were my students, their ""work"" would have received poor critiques. Most of the artists in ""Art: 21"" have very distorted viewpoints and incomprehensible verbal and graphic communication skills. Many appear psychologically troubled. Few have the technical and observational skills one associates with great art. The exception is Josiah McElheny who demonstrates in clear terms a reverence for the past and a vision for the present and future. Do not waste your money on this DVD.",1231804800,8,867,5.112676056338028
2394682,5,B000AV2GF6,This is a great DVD for those interested in learning about comtemporary artists and how they make their art. Great for Art teachers also.,1226275200,4,137,4.75
2394683,5,B000AV2GF6,I love watching Art 21 while I make my jewelry. It gives me lots of inspiration and keeps me up to date with the art world.,1204588800,,123,3.769230769230769
2394684,5,B000AV2GF6,I am a practicing artist and really enjoyed listening to other artists share themselves and their art in a very intimate and informative format.,1178150400,8,144,5.041666666666667
2394685,5,B000AV2GF6,"Powerful, fast moving, comprehensive, well researched, resourceful, well filmed, comfortable to the eye, I could go on and on describing this brilliant work by PBS. This feature is like a tour to various artists' studios and exhibitions without leaving your chair. I loved it so much I ordered the 1st & 2nd seasons, which come together by the way on one DVD.

They should add this tagline to the DVD box: ""Inspiration GUARANTEED!"" What are you waiting for? Click 'Add to Shopping Cart' right now.",1158883200,11,497,4.847058823529411
