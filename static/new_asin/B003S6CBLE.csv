Nor did they work in the laptops we had, so we contacted the seller, and they refunded our money quickly and didn't ask that we ship them back either. I was very relieved, not to have to pay for that...cannot wait until this collection is sold in the US! My 2 year old loves the YouTube videos and watches them over and over, but they are very short...would love to play this in the car, as he has learned a lot from the videos on YT",1364947200,,563,4.127272727272727
8404025,3,B003S6CBLE,"These DVDs are entertaining but not as educational for my 2 year old as I expected (he knows his shapes, colors,  alphabet and numbers 1-20 in Spanish and English).  The set shows the ABCs until the 4th disk.  They also show numbers 1,2,3 and shapes.  This DVD set will be best for my 4 month old.",1364947200,,297,4.25

I wanted to see more by this UK producer.  I am very pleased with this 4 pack of educational DVD's that introduce concepts in a way that is very engaging for my two toddlers.  I can tell that they are grasping the information and retaining it.  I was very pleased to have found out about this great learning tool!  Each of the 4 DVD's have 4 separate 15 min segments on them.  It is the perfect length, as it stops leaving the kid not quite satisfied and eager to watch another segment the next day.  We watch one before naptime most days - a favorite ritual by my two!",1327708800,,864,5.217391304347826
8404027,4,B003S6CBLE,"My som really liked the DVDs and he was very excited at first. However, the excitment did not last for too long. I think because they do not feature a good veriety of characters/music/etc. so my son gets bored really fast. It never happens with the Baby Einetein DVDs so I would personally recommend those over the Bee Bright.",1319760000,,326,4.5423728813559325
8404028,5,B003S6CBLE,"I bought the whole box set of 4 Dvd's as I have 2 sons, one aged 3 and one 18 months old. Due to their ages we have currently only watched the first 3 DVD's and I can honestly say that they are riveted by each episode. My eldest son has Down's syndrome and mostly communicates with sign language but he absolutely amazed me on only his second viewing of Bee Bright by waving at the character Buzz and actually saying 'BUZZ'. His younger brother is also a big fan and the two of them wave hello and goodbye at Buzz and Fizz at every opportunity.

I have great hopes that the DVD's will help them both to learn colours, shapes and words in a very fun way. They both seem to love the music too and have a special little dance reserved for Bee Bright viewing. From my perspective it is cleverly and very professionally put together with the right amount of repetition needed for pre schoolers. I like its simplicity and the fact that I can turn off commentary and provide that myself and whilst initially I didn't really connect with the two characters Buzz and Fizz my two boys, who are definitely the right target audience, LOVE them!

Very pleased I found this set and was even more delighted when I showed it to our Speech and Language therapist who said that she had also read about it and that it was recommended to help children progress with their language development and understanding of concepts, eg big and small, shapes and colours.

I would recommend these DVDs to anyone!",1296777600,,1482,4.4411764705882355
8404029,5,B003S6CBLE,We have used these DVDs for my son since he was 6 months old and he has loved every one. He has picked up most of his knowledge of colours and shapes from these and his kindergarten has even remarked on how advanced his knowledge of shapes and colours is for his age!  He can also repeat the whole alphabet as it is said and sung in these DVDs - and this has been since he was aged around 22 months.  The logo on these DVDs says `Give Your Child A Flying Start!' and that is definitely what they have done for my son!  The DVDs are entertaining and very well made and I would thoroughly recommend them to any parent.  We have also tried the Baby Einstein DVDs but our son much prefers these - and so do we!,1287014400,2,706,4.021428571428571
