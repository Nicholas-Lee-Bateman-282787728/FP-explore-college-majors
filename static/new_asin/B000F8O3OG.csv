This one is a unrecognized gem that I don't see myself having to dust off very frequently. I have been collecting anime for 15 years and I just stumbled onto this one by accident. It's great. It is the story of 6 women living in Hokkaido. They all lead very different lives, but they share a common bond. Even though these girls have never met they are tied together by their aching hearts. Each girl is given 2 episodes to encounter a problem and find a solution. I think that a few of them are better than the others.

SHOKO is a radio host. She has a show where she gives relationship advice to the bewildered. She has relationship troubles of her own though. Living alone with a fly by night lover isn't an ideal situation. She soon discovers that she has a stalker. She is happy for the attention, but a little freaked out by it. After she crumbles and realizes that an unhappy woman has no business giving advice to so many people, she gives up and falls apart on the air. At her darkest moment her stalker bursts in and gives her the encouragement and appreciation that she needs to realize how truly important she is.

AKARI has lived alone with her Dad ever since her mother died. She works and tries to keep the two together, but her Father is a mess. He's always drinking and panning for gold. Her situation is tough, but she soon finds out that Dad has brain cancer. She doesn't have much time left to spend with him, but she has a supportive friend. She may be ablr to have one last special moment with Dad before he dies.

This is my 2nd favorite volume. The 1st is the best. The story of Akari is one of my favorites, and the final episode where the 6 girls go to the festival and meet is an amazing conclusion as well. It ties everything together beautifully. This anime is incredible. It's a must have. I suggest getting the complete collection, but if you don't want to dish out that much money, the 1st, and the 3rd volumes are the best.",1352937600,,2123,4.3025
8119122,5,B000F8O3OG,"The final set of episodes in this series is arguably the best, as two very different women face some daunting challenges.
Shoko is a radio dj, dispensing her own brand of wisdom, and music on a public that adores her. She seems to have it all together. But in reality she is involved with a married man, in a increasingly one sided relationship. As the distance grows between them, and her trials increase, our heroine is forced to question her values, and her own sage advice.
Akari, on the other hand, is a sweet, if somewhat clumsy student who works at a local confectionery. She is also principle bread winner for her family, as she is without her mom, and her father is a drunk and only marginally successful gold prospector. Her situation seems intolerable, till her father's illness is revealed. Then she has to find a way to let him go.
The final episode is quite interesting, as we get one more look at what fate has sent our heroines. For some, life is a bit more normal; for some it has improved; and for one it seems a bit worse. In the end, for all these ladies there is still hope for better times and happiness, symbolized as all see diamond dust for themselves on one special afternoon.
There are certainly no simple solutions to any of these ladies ' problems, much like in real life. The fact that there is so much truth here makes the story that much more endearing. Don't let the diamond dust blind you, there's a real story here, and it's a beut.",1216080000,4,1467,4.437037037037037
8119123,5,B000F8O3OG,"The excellent and wisdom infused series of Diamond Daydreams has finally come to an end with the tales of two more women that have come to crossroads in their lives that will either break them or make them aspire to even greater things. First, there's Shoko who has a radio show where she gives advice to listener's emails about relationship issues. The problem is that Shoko is having problems of her own. The man she loves is married and has a kid, and due to the added pressures of his job (or so he says), he hardly ever sees her, so Shoko is getting frustrated. In addition to that, one of her fans seems to be stalking her...or trying to make her feel better by sending her little gifts. The second set of episodes has to do with Akari, a clumsy but kind girl working at a confectionary whose father is a alcoholic who spends most of his time drinking. If he's not getting drunk, he's out panning for gold in the local river. Akari is barely able to keep a roof over their heads and on top of that, a bad boy that used to work with her is giving her unwanted attention...well, unwanted at first. The fifth episode on the dvd wraps the series up by bringing all the characters from all 3 volumes together in one way or another.

The thing I liked about this series was that it was always honest and didn't have fairy tale endings. Even episodes that seemed like fairy tales ended with a jolting realism. All the relationships didn't work out for everybody so there was some sadness, just like in real life. But you do get the sense that all these women will move on and have a chance at happiness someday, if they don't have it now. They all have prospects even though it might not look easy. This anime will appeal to more adult viewers. It has a lot of wisdom in it. You'll feel yourself shaking your head in agreement as you watch the show because it's life. Great show.

There are a ton of extras on this dvd. There are behind the scenes interviews with all the Japanese voice actresses and two radio shows where they answer emails in character. There are even Japanese bloopers, which is one of the first times I've seen that on an anime dvd before. There is also a neat travelogue that gives pictures and information of some of the actual places in the anime.",1150848000,7,2270,4.364066193853428
