8310395,5,B001I2HCCS,Nice change from some of the other DVD's. The Bike-O-Vision series makes stationary cycling much more enjoyable. Forget reading a book when training. Cycling to the passing of beautiful scenery is the way to go.,1389830400,,211,5.057142857142857
8310396,1,B001I2HCCS,"This DVD, while created by ""Bike-O-Vision"" is not recommended for anyone on a bike trainer who is looking for sense of road cycling.
- The quality of the video photography is rather poor (certainly not HD). Do you like both blurry and grainy?...I don't.
- The filming cuts abruptly from a forward view to a sideways view.
- There are stationary zoom-in-to-feature shots.
- In urban areas (i.e.,Victoria), the filming cuts out every time the camera vehicle approaches a stop sign and magically restarts from somewhere else which really destroys any sense of flow. There are not more than 15 seconds of continuous filming before it cuts to another view.
- There are numerous examples of where the photographer is oblivious to light and contrast and while the sky appears blue, the urban landscape appears as a near-black silhouette with no visible scenery.
- In rural areas the apparent road speed (for a road bike) is unrealistically fast, as evident by the blurry side imagery.
- Some of the filming is from the perspective of a cyclist (i.e., off to the side of the road), but much of it is from a clearly roof-mounted camera on a vehicle so the perspective is both too high, and in the centre of the road lane.
- Some of the filming appears that the filming vehicle driver inadvertently tuned into a dead end road, thus requiring a new scene to start, which really breaks up any sense of flow.

Overall, if you are looking for bike scenery to train with indoors, stay away from this DVD (and perhaps series of DVDs).  Hope this saves you the $16 I wasted.",1325203200,,1557,4.63768115942029
8310397,2,B001I2HCCS,This DVD was really designed for stationary biking but as an armchair traveller I found this to be very poor. The music as mentioned by others had no flow to it and was rather cheesy at times. The imagery was not bad but a little unsteady at times. I actually found it quite boring and had to speed-play thru most of it.,1250208000,,320,4.17741935483871
