7920210,5,B00004CYOA,"What did I like most? ""As Steals the Morn Upon the Night"". In this performance, the most beautiful piece of music I""ve ever heard. And I've heard quite a lot. Liked the least? ""False Imagine"". But it's still nice. This is all a matter of taste of course but this DVD is the most prized in my collection; one I return to every now and again in whole or in part, and one I wouldn't be without. In fact, I've got two copies in case of accidents.",1516838400,,442,4.091954022988506
7920211,5,B00004CYOA,"Candle-lit churches, cabs, and coffeehouses, fountians and bridges, art and architecture - London at night is the backdrop for this fantastic collage of some of Handle's most beautiful operatic arias sung by first-rate artists (Ainsley, Connolly, McFadden, Miles) and interspersed with bits of Handel biography.  The idea is to impress us with the universality of Handel - and it works.  In an hour-long wander through London streets we encounter a woman disappointed by a blind date (""False Imagine""/Ottone); a knife-wielding man pursued by intimidating thugs (""Al lampo del armi""/Guilio Cesare); an insomniac businessman suffering job-related stress (""Pastorello d'un povero armento""/Rodelinda); and of course the heartbreak of a woman spotting her lover with another through a shaded window (""Scherza infida""/Ariodante), just to mention a few.  Finally, as dark fades to gray and the sun rises, we end with a ravishing version of ""As steals the morn"".  Great concept.  Great execution.  Great DVD.  Don't miss it!",1195171200,10,1016,5.558441558441558
7920212,5,B00004CYOA,I saw this on a U.S. broadcast of an English television production and rushed to buy the DVD when it became available.  This is a brilliant introduction to Handel and his operatic music.  All the artists are first rate.  The camera work is an artistic triumph.  This is one of the best DVDs of classical music you will ever see.  It is one of the high points of contemporary postmodern art.,1181001600,2,390,4.436619718309859
7920213,5,B00004CYOA,SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL! I had watched this program in a brazilian  TV channel. When I saw it here in Amazon I ordered it immediately. Sosarme's love duet Per le porte del tormento was what I enjoyed the most. It's Handel in one of his  uncountable lovely melodies. GREAT!,1179273600,3,266,4.638297872340425
