PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD. Ten years later Lucy, somehow out of the blue, finds the couple that tortured her and blows the entire family away with a shotgun...pretty cool stuff. Then the story turns weird as Anna reluctantly goes and helps Lucy clean-up. The weird was pretty good and then we find out what it was all about: People who die with their eyes open (see cover).

If you have seen it and love it like I do, then don't waste your time unless you can see it for free and there's nothing else on.  One of the greatest things about the original is how uncomfortable it makes you feel to be seeing what's being portrayed on screen.

Young Lucie is a tormented girl who has visions of monsters trying to get her, when she was 10 years old she escaped from a warehouse where she was kept prisoner and horribly abused, she spends her life growing up in an orphanage and makes friends with Anna and starts to try and live a normal life. 10 years later still haunted by her demons she finds the family that tormented her as a child and goes to their home to get revenge, but something far worse is waiting for them as the truth comes out.

This is of course a remake of the 2008 original French movie of the same, the movie receives a battering purely because its different which is ridiculous, if you have never seen the original then no matter, this new version of Martyrs is still a great horror with a huge impact on the mind with its utterly twisted ideas, things do differ and change slightly here and there with the story but the basic idea is exactly the same, its a great story that starts slow and builds up really well with twisted reveals and crazy ideas, there is plenty of violence still maybe not as much as the original but not much less really, the movie don't focus on that anyway its about the twisted psychological torture and the reasons behind it, it still holds a certain amount of shock and the average horror fan should love it, its great to watch in English too, not everyone likes subtitled movies!

7564654,2,B019649GQ4,"The original French Canadian 'Martyrs' was a brilliant, uncompromising work of art. Harrowing yet compassionate, profoundly sad and ultimately transcendent, there is nothing else quite like it. Unfortunately, this American remake does not begin to have the same haunting impact or chilling, poetic artistry of the original. This ""reimagining"" is from a whole different, much less challenging planet. Despite some effective moments from the cast (my primary reason for giving this 2 stars rather than 1), they are sabotaged by a wrongheaded screenplay which makes every deviation from the original a change for the worse. Pascal Laugier's devastating masterpiece utilized subtlety and suggestion as well as explicit cruelty to achieve its nightmarish impact, going way beyond this comparatively tepid ""remake"" in its power to terrify and disturb, accomplishing, in the process, something remarkable which this version doesn't even attempt -- to leave the viewer both emotionally drained and intellectually tantalized. How many ""horror"" films accomplish that? Only a rare few. And this new version of 'Martyrs' certainly cannot be added to that list.",1457395200,4,1148,5.641618497109826

Sure it doesnt have as much torture and gore, but it still was a great film. they focused on the relationship of lucy and anna much more than the original which was missing from the original.  You really have great character development in this one, but at the cost of the extreme brutality the original had. Its still graphic, but nothing tops Pascal Laugiers film to this day.  the u.s. version is beautifully shot, amazing soundtrack and is well acted. I still prefer the original, but for a U.S. remake, it was pretty well done. Dont listen to the remake haters. If you can judge it on its own merits, your in for a surprise.

The original did everything better. Go see the original instead, much better movie. I did not care for any of the characters in the Martyrs reboot either. Fans of the original may be disappointed in this one. Id say rent it if you must see it.",1454716800,3,551,4.63265306122449
7564665,5,B019649GQ4,"Unlike most others, I welcome horror movie remakes.  I know that most end up being trash.  But there are the few that end up being decent horror movies in their own merit.  Yes, I'm a fan of the original 2008 French film Martyrs.  I mean I really loved the intense raw terror of the original mixed.  But like most have said, it wasn't just about the terror.  It had deep meaning.  Which is why it has become one of the biggest horror cult classics of the past 20 years.  So when I heard that they were making an American remake, I was honestly excited.  The producers promised to keep the intensity of the original.  This announcement was way back in 2010.  So you can imagine I've been waiting nearly 6 years for this.  Now the film is finally here.  I will admit that the trailer for the film released online made it look very mediocre.  And I knew that most other fans of the original would trash the film relentlessly regardless of its true value.  It is hard to not compare this to the original.  The critics reviews seem implausible too.  I guess I'm the rare fan of the original that actually liked it.

*Basic Plot*
A girl escapes from captivity from being tortured on a daily basis.  The police return to find the torture site abandoned.  The girl is sent to an orphanage where she befriends another orphan girl and sees visions of a monster.  Years later as an adult she tracks down her captors and takes revenge, which sets off a chain of even more terrifying events for her and her best friend.

That really is just a typical summary of the plot to lure you in.  It's for the most part a carbon copy of the originals story.  Some scenes are shot for shot.  There are a few tweaks that are ""Americanized"", but are still a bit intense compared to other horror remakes that seem dumbed down.  I will admit that upon my first viewing I was disappointed in the handling of the ending.  But the film still stuck with me long after.  I read all these negative reviews prior and expected the holy grail of terrible remakes.  I'm glad to find out most of those reviews are completely misguided.  Yes, it pales in comparison to the original.  But it is not nearly as bad as other fans have said it is.  They seem to blindly hate it.  I read one negative review that pointed out that the movie had country music, as if that played a big part in the soundtrack, when in reality it was literally just 10 seconds of the music near the beginning.  Others say the acting is typical terrible American remake bad acting.  Again, wrong.  Sure it wasn't Oscar worthy acting.  But it was all believable.  Yes, the ending and captivity scenes are changed a lot.  They are still intense, but less effective.  BUT, still pretty good.  I think the movie was still a pretty good horror film.  There were scenes of brooding terror in the beginning.  The musical score is very epic and emotional for a horror movie.  The acting is pretty good.  The production value is really good for a low budget remake.  There are some visual shots during the daytime scenes that are eye candy.  The  message the original sent out is still present, just not delivered nearly as well.  But it's still there!  The ending will disappoint fans of the very memorable finale of the original, but in its own context it works decently.  So all these insanely negative reviews should not be taken that seriously until you've seen the movie for yourself and will form your own positive or negative opinion.  Believe it or not, even the original hasn't been seen by everyone.  So most early reviews for this remake are from disgruntled fans of the original who went out to do nothing but trash this film.  Of course if you saw the original and liked it, you will have a hard time not comparing the two.  At first I was comparing them, but once I looked at this movie as a standalone horror film pretending the original didn't exist, I found it to be a pretty good horror experience.  For the moment, I'd trust the opinion on this film of someone who hasn't seen the original more than the angry fans.  Because their minds are fresh.  They won't be overly nitpicky.  Some will, but most might appreciate this for it's true value.  Sure its  not nearly the best horror movie ever made, but it's one of the best remakes.  I'd bet anything that if this was released nationwide in theaters first, that it would get a warmer response from reviewers.  I say if you haven't seen the original, you'll have a better time seeing this on your horror movie night.  If you did see the original I strongly recommend you try your hardest not to compare the two and view this as if its truly a standalone film.  I predict as time passes by this will find a small cult following.  The reviews will slightly get better.  Either way, turn up the volume, turn off the lights, and enjoy.

**Fun Fact**
The writer of this remake is the same man who wrote the adapted screenplay for the award winning film The Revenant.  Believe it or not.",1454371200,10,4974,4.4511111111111115
7564666,1,B019649GQ4,"1. This movie, directed by the Goetz Brothers, is billed as ""The Ultimate Horror Movie"". It's a complete lie.

I don't think I've ever been as mad or as disgusted at such a cinematic disaster as this one. Thirty seconds into it, I knew it was trash. My friend, watching it with me, wanted to give it a real chance. He lasted 8 more minutes before he gave up and agreed with me.

2. The original 2008 French horror film, ""Martyrs"", changed my life. It was a cinematic and cultural landmark. Not only was it an example of a new extreme in horror film, but it was existentially relevant. It was smart, and bleak, and excruciating, but it dared to take on the issue of one of the most important questions of being human.

3. The American remake (which got a small theatrical release in January 2016) is  everything that the original is not.

4. Both versions have the same basic plot: a girl escapes from captors that had been torturing her, finds a friend, and together they try to get revenge.

Besides that basic plot set-up, however, these are opposite movies. The original is about the limits of trauma that a human can endure, and what happens when those limits are passed. The remake, in the words of the screenwriter Mark Smith, is about ""trying to save a friend.""

5. The cinematography of this film is flat and uninspired. It looks like it was made with barely more than a college student ramen-noodle budget.

6. The acting is terrible. None of the actors seem to have any idea of what it could possibly feel like to experience more pain than tearing a fingernail. The two main actresses look like models, complete with bouncy curly hair.

7. The extreme violence that this story requires is turned down in this movie to about the same level as an episode of CSI: Miami. During the captivity scenes, the two women (yes, two) are wearing padded handcuffs that they could have easily escaped from.

8. The original ""Martyrs"" did not do that well in the box office. It was too extreme, and the philosophical implications were too horrible, for most audiences to handle. But writer/director Pascal Laugier had the guts to take the movie where it needed to go, which made it famous in certain circles.

This movie is about as gutsy as ""American Idol"".

9. If you are a serious fan of cinema, this movie is useful as a study of how American films differ from French films on the same topic. Other than that, there is no possible reason to watch this film. If you haven't seen the original, this piece of trash will not give you the intended message. And if you have seen the original, the very fact that this version was even made is an existential insult.",1454112000,38,2657,4.524008350730689

This version changes so much of the original and, in the process, destroys much of what is conveyed in the first.  For example, the initial escape scene and the extreme suffering the girls must endure to get to martyrdom.

The newer version, while somewhat gory, was toned down considerably and is tame compared to the first.  This was likely to make it more palatable for the audience who like some form of happy ending.

The version of the film in 2008 had a direct message it delivered with considerable impact.  This version had little it delivered in that respect.  The acting was nowhere near close to the 2008 version.  The rescripting horribly thought out and seems to have been done by a person that did not even bother to watch the first film.

8744148,2,B019649GQ4,"I have never been one of those people to say that the original is better than the remake based on the virtue of it being the original. And I never will be one of those pretentious people either. I think my biggest mistake was watching the original and the remake very closely to one another; all within the same week. One was super effective and stayed with me for several days afterward and the other fell flat in that regard.
It's just such a shame that this film didn't meet it's potential, because it could've if not for all the unnecessary changes towards the end. The fear of the original film was from loss and isolation and the remake unfortunately loses that.
The two films are pretty much identical in the first half, it's the last two halves that the remake goes off course. The creepy dungeon and the found victim are both changed greatly, and lose their effectiveness because of the change. The found victim in the original is just a sickening experience, especially when you discover what really happened to her. Everything is just so unflinching and visceral that it takes your breath away. The dungeon in the original was disturbing all on its own; really giving you an idea of the isolation and claustrophobia the victim must've felt. Truly horrific. The remake takes a wholly different approach with the dungeon and especially with the found victim, Sam. Besides now having a name the victim is pretty much okay; no nausea-inducing body modifications or severe mental trauma or suicidal tendencies. So, pretty much okay.
Let's talk about Lucie's monster for a minute. In the original it is heavily implied that every victim has a ""thing"" that will drive said victim towards suicide. Lucie's ""thing"" is her monster; who's backstory is terribly sad and disturbing. There is so much going on in the original that when you finally get to the one-two gut punch at the end you'll understand everything and wish you didn't.
The remake essentially pulls all punches and loses most, if not all, of the creeping horror and atmosphere of the original. If this remake had just went for it like the ""Oldboy"" remake did then it would probably be one of my favorites, but it held back too much to be disturbing and showed too much to be subtle.
That's not to say that the movie is terrible or anything of the sort, at least not in my opinion. It's well acted and the effects, when are shown, are pretty realistic. If you have found this movie with no real knowledge of the original and you enjoyed yourself or perhaps you loved the film; then please do check out the original, but do bring tissues and a friend to hug afterwards.",1501027200,,2632,4.650214592274678
