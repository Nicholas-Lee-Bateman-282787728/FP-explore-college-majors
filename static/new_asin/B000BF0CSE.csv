8085917,3,B000BF0CSE,This documentary was WONDERFUL! I loved it as a kid and it was great to see it again as an adult. I marked it down because the quality of the DVD was not nearly what was expected. It's not remastered and it was very expensive,1512259200,,225,4.022222222222222

8085919,5,B000BF0CSE,"A great condensed Martial Arts documentary. There was some footage of Bruce Lee that I had never seen before. But I could have really done without the Gracie hype, with them bragging about themselves. Overall, a good A&E production.",1414022400,,232,4.9743589743589745

8085921,5,B000BF0CSE,"I am very disappointed that this film has been discontinued. I have it on VHS but it is incomplete. It is a great survey of the martial arts. It focuses on the cultural and historical, so you will not find any secret techniques, or an in-depth treatment of any particular area. Very basic, yes, but a good start for young practitioners with no background. When you have spent decades immersed in the martial arts it is easy to forget that there are young beginners that just need a simple overview, a broad perspective to help them get started. Yes, there is nothing extraordinary here that I have not seen or heard before, but most new students don't know it, or their perspective of the martial arts is a confusing collage of stilted information, mostly spurious. Before the internet and media explosion of the 1990's made so much (good and bad) information available and changed martial arts forever, it was very difficult to find any material. In a way, it makes me sad the way that has diluted the relationship that a student has with their teacher, but on the other hand myth and misinformation abounded. One way to keep that teacher/student relationship strong is to become a reliable resource of good information, and to start your students out with a strong foundation regarding the cultural and historical background of the art. This film provides an engaging and fundamental source of cultural and historical background for new students, and an interesting review for more experienced practitioners. I hope that it will be released again soon.",1255824000,,1554,4.890151515151516
8085922,2,B000BF0CSE,I was pretty dissapointed with this purchase. For being as long as it was I expected it to be more in depth. There was nothing on here I haven't seen before and I've actually seen better stuff on u tube as well as the best parts of this one. Don't waste your money.,1173312000,2,265,4.018867924528302
8085923,4,B000BF0CSE,"This DVD was a terrific survey of the origins of various Far Eastern martial arts that are now seen in the West.

The DVD is about 90 minutes featuring the history of many martial arts forms, how they evolved in the last few hundred years and how they are being practiced in the US today from the popular to the esoteric.

The material is interesting and the production quality is high. No particular martial arts type is emphasized and there is a broad section covered.",1172188800,7,470,4.517647058823529
