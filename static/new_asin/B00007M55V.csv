1821460,5,B00007M55V,"I found the movie as accurate as can be imagined.  Having lived through the experience as a veteran of the cold war, my feeling at the time were mixed.  PATH TO WAR, is about the Murphy Law factor in all wars, where if anything can go wrong it will.  The mounting casualties, and longivity destroyed much of the idealistic resolve, and we were faced with the best hopes for an honorable peace. Being a native Texan, I thought the script was most kind to LBJ.",1123977600,4,458,4.364705882352941
1821461,4,B00007M55V,"As president, the Texas Lyndon Baines Johnson had bigger ideas about the USA than the size of longhorns in his native state. He believed he could fuel the world's largest burgeoning economy, build a Great Society of wealth and equality, end the racial divide and conquer communism all at the same time.

When he found he couldn't do all this -- and that he failed miserably in some efforts -- he turned away from politics and delivered his famous ""I shall not seek..."" speech from spring 1968.

This movie probably better captures the spirit, emotion and personal drive of LBJ -- especially as it regards his decisions to engage in all out war in Vietnam -- than any of docudrama or film treatment of the man. It shows the man that was LBJ, a president that publicly picked up his beagle by the ears and once showed the White House press corps his surgical scar.

While LBJ's handling of Alabama Gov. George Wallace and a few other events get some time in the biopic, it is the decision making about the Vietnam War that HBO best captured in this movie. Directed by John Frankenheimer and with significant roles for Donald Sutherland and Alec Baldwin as Clark Clifford and Robert McNamara, this film faithfully displays the network of advisors that surrounded LBJ, played well by Michael Gambon.

Perhaps most moving of all scenes is the one where Clifford confronts the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vietnam military commanders. ""What is the plan to win the war in Vietnam?"" Clifford asked. Stunned, no one has an answer. No scene, real or fictionalized, better summarizes the political life displayed in this film.

Lovers of McNamara's embarassing self-serving documentary, ""The Fog of War"", will not be pleased to see their hero dethroned in this movie. In the early moments of the conflict, McNamara first straddles the fence on Vietnam, then pushes against doves including George Ball to get LBJ to commit big manpower in southeast Asia (just like he did in real life according to White House transcripts and the book ""The Pentagon Papers""). It is a far cry from the story the real McNamara wanted you to believe in his own foggy film.

Whether all or none of the remaining scenes are true is not of much consequence. We all know what happened in Vietnam and we are seeing it played out day after day in Iraq right now, another quagmire in the making. American invovlement in the Vietnam war gave rise to a famous theory of irreversability -- that says the longer you move in one direction, the more difficult it is to reverse that direction.

The time frame on Vietnam in this film is through 1968, when American sentiment turned against the war, as well as the thinking of most American politicians. Still, it was two presidents and seven years later before our involvement terminated. That's why the decision making on display in this movie is as important in 2005 as it was in 1968. This is a fine slice of political life that anyone who has an interest in politics or history should see.",1122163200,9,2998,4.699047619047619
1821462,4,B00007M55V,"THE PATH TO WAR is John Frankenheimer's biography of the Vietnam War, told through the prism of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson.  The movie, director Frankenheimer's last, was produced and released in 2002 as the United States was preparing to launch a war against Iraq.  As such it serves as a cautionary tale with a strong political point of view - the message is simple and strong: Even the best and the brightest can be blinded by optimism, and a quagmire once entered is not easily left.

  THE PATH TO WAR spends a great deal of time in cabinet meetings.  This is a political drama pitting special advisor Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) against Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Alec Baldwin) in battle for the heart and mind of President Johnson (Michael Gambon).  Clifford is the Dove, the main player advocating restraint and caution viz. Vietnam, while McNamara Hawkishly counsels a steady buildup of American forces. At first English actor Gambon seemed an odd choice for the role of Texas-born Johnson.  He fits the part physically, and he's the right age, but his west Texas accent is a bit off the mark.  Not terribly off, but he doesn't nail it either.  Johnson is a familiar television presence from my youth and his heavy drawl must have made a deep impression.  In any event, it was distracting for a while, but Gambon is such a strong actor, and otherwise so right for the part that I stopped worrying about it after a while.

  Frankenheimer was a personal friend of Johnson's arch-foe Robert Kennedy, and a generation ago Frankenheimer might have treated Johnson as a bit more of a political monster.  Indeed, Johnson the politician could play rough.  In one early scene, Johnson gives the mailed-fist-in-the-velvet-glove treatment to Alabama Governor George Wallace (Gary Sinise) when Wallace threatens Johnson's civil rights' initiatives.  Later, when speech writer Dick Goodwin (James Frain), the man who `put the music' in Johnson's speeches, tells Johnson that he's leaving to accept a fellowship, Johnson, in the space of perhaps three minutes, bribes, cajoles, and ultimately threatens Goodwin into staying.  Still, the ultimate impression of Johnson is of a man whose presidency was ruined because of a misplaced reliance on advisors rather than an innate blood lust.  The villains in THE PATH TO WAR are arrogance, an overestimation of America's military capabilities, and a woeful underestimation of North Vietnam's willingness to engage in a prolonged and costly war.  The worst player in this cast turns out to be McNamara, who is partly redeemed by his doubts at the end.

  THE PATH TO WAR is a very good HBO movie.  There aren't many extras on the disk.  The making of and cast interviews are very short - three or four minutes per extra - and not terribly informative or insightful.  Still, a very strong recommendation for this one.",1113609600,64,2879,4.983228511530398
1821463,5,B00007M55V,"An entertaining and instructive (and somewhat lengthy) film about the political fallout of the Vietnam war in the Johnson administration.  The details of the key decision-makers and advisors are fascinating.  With the help of hindsight we want to yell at them for their failure to see where the war was leading and the devastation it would leave in its wake.  Some may argue that it gives a somewhat more favorable view of LBJ than what he deserves in history, perhaps.  But, on the other hand, it portrays the times he was too easily swayed by one side and belittled or ignored dissent.  There is little doubt LBJ felt the weight of his responsibility in the war.  It is also apparent how he saw the war and the fear of being weak as costing him the ""great society"" he wished to create.  A very good and somewhat sympathetic view of a president overwhelmed by the political pressures brought about by the Vietnam quagmire.",1098748800,4,923,4.660493827160494
1821464,5,B00007M55V,"Path to War is a very good , very well researched movie . The movie shows  Lyndon Johnson as a man who is torn between sending more and more troops into Vietnam while at the same time wondering if the war is winnable. I have read many books about LBJ and am glad a movie sticks with the facts. I am 24 yrs old and hope that the rest of my and the younger generation will take the time to see this movie. Even if you lived in the 60's  and already have a opinion about LBJ and Vietnam, please do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",1097107200,7,533,3.925925925925926
1821465,5,B00007M55V,"I hadn't seen this film before the DVD arrived in my letterbox - the name of the Director John Frankenheimer was what originally caught my attention plus it was about Vietnam and the war of my generation.
 When the war broke out I remember my father saying it was ""an unwinnable war"" and of course I had no idea what he meant - he who had served in the AIF in New Guinea in WW11. And so it became obvious watching this brilliant HBO film that with the best will in the world President Johnson and his cohorts had no comprehension of what they were getting into either. It was only later when the reports came back describing how villagers cycled down to a stricken train to help unload it (the lines had been destroyed by US bombing) and painstakingly moved the items on board the train to handlebars of bicycles to be ferried to another train further down the line. How they built devices across rivers to replace blown up bridges, and how they determinedly went on with their lives as best they could that the White House staff realised with growing alarm that they could be in this war forever.
 Johnson himself comes across as a man under enormous pressure, much of it caused by his insecurity and self doubts. The rest of course was brought upon him by the Vietnam war,which wrecked his health and eventually him destroyed him.
 This is an excellent, accurate portrayal of the machinations of Vietnam as I remember it, and it paints a picture of men trying to grapple with a war they don't understand, fearful of defeat (unthinkable) the escalating cost and Johnson's programmes to help the poor and Civil Rights in danger of being lost as the national budget is blown to smithereens.
 Micahel Gambon was magnificent as LBJ, as was Donald Sutherland.
 The film is engrossing from beginning to end, in fact the whole DVD package is a must have in my opinion.",1091577600,33,1862,4.562874251497006

To be honest I was not all that familiar with the Vietnam War so this movie provided me with some fascinating insight.  All the performances are terrific,

1821467,5,B00007M55V,"We could not stop watching, a great movie.",1073174400,,42,4.375
1821468,4,B00007M55V,"I highly recommend this movie for two very good reasons.
 First, the acting and the dialogue involved with this project are great. I can still hear Lady Bird Johnson telling a frightened and fatigued LBJ ""When eloquence of words are no longer effective, then perhaps it is time for eloquence of action..."" And with these words, LBJ decides to retire the presidency and public life.
 Second, I recommend ""Path to War"" because of the subject of this impressive movie is Lyndon Baines Johnson. Arguably one of the most controversial figures of American history, it is easy to forget all the good he has done for our country in the hell of Vietnam. This movie finally reminds the viewer that although President Kennedy had such wonderful dreams and ideas for our society, it was President Johnson who made those dreams a reality by maneuvering the congress to enact the ""Great Society"" laws. The audience can feel his joy and elation as he sees his vision of an America that has beaten poverty, racial discrimination, and the host of other social ills present in America during the 1960s. Then, we see his dreams transformed into nightmares as the American public become increasingly angry and hostile with his policy towards Vietnam. The audience is shown the private torture inflicted by decisions president Johnson makes in regards to Vietnam and the anger he knew they would generate...In conclusion, ""Path to War"" reminds me of a Greek tragety; riveting and enjoyable to watch and experience in the comfort of ones own home.",1052006400,8,1525,4.929961089494164
1821469,4,B00007M55V,"Being a huge John Frankenheimer fan, this movie was on my list to see for some time since I don't have HBO.  Overall, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, somehow I have that perception with all made-for-tv movies.  The movie certainly has that feel in the first few minutes, with acting that seems a bit forced and wooden.  But as the story progressed, I slowly got pulled into the situation and characters of all involved.  By the time the movie was over, I was impressed with the portrait provided of LBJ as a troubled man who wanted to do so much for the country, but was held back with a stalemate war.  It's expertly directed by Frankenheimer, with his classic visual style that exudes tension with facial close-ups.  Gambon does a pretty good job too, although most of his acting in this movie falls into the `concerned man' and the `screaming and yelling man' episodes; it still shows the bi-polar sources pulling at him.
It resonates a bit with the current tensions and war in Iraq (some of this is mentioned in the bonus features), but it still carves out its own identity; when was the last time a President talked about a Great Society?  It makes me wonder how significant of a President Johnson could have been (many books defer to this position as well, almost worthy of a place on Mt. Rushmore).  But as a youngster, most of the Presidents I've been alive to experience are focused more on cautious outlooks than on civil progression and visionary goals.  Of course its all easier said than done, but it seems to me the era visionaries has ceased with Johnson's statement not run for a second term in office.
I know very little of the historic values of past Presidents, but it's a genre I enjoy experiencing in the movies and television.  If you watch the West Wing on a regular basis, or just enjoy movies with historical facts and situations (13 days, JFK, All the Presidents Men), then you'll enjoy this movie.  I expected little, and I got a home run in return.  I think it's a great movie that concludes Frankenheimer's career.  I like his work a lot, and he will be missed.
It should be noted that the movie is not 4x3 full frame format.  Instead it's in 16x9, anamorphic format; and the transfer I would rate as `good' but not exceptional.",1050364800,23,2270,4.545454545454546

  I want you all to Research, ""Operation Northwoods"". This proposed operation was presented to John F. Kennedy, by Lyndon B Johnson, when Johnson was vice president to Kennedy. In it is the proposition to Kennedy to stage a ""false attack"", against our own American people, in order to give reason to pursue war in Vietnam. It should be noted that Kennedy was thoroughly disgusted with the idea of attacking Americans, Kennedy strongly verbally reprimanded Johnson for even so much as mentioning or suggesting such a treasonous act.
  Just 8 months after Kennedy's assassination, the ""The Gulf of Tonkin incident"" supposedly occurred. In which north Vietnamese supposedly sunk an American destroyer. Later in court it was admitted that the Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened. They claimed it was all a mistake.

I'm sure criticism would've been considered tasteless.  But it seems clear Sec'y McNamara (well played by Alec Baldwin) was the real architect of the war.  LBJ's growing frustration with the war and decisive action on domestic matters, the civil rights movement for one, made for a complex situation.

If you're interested in the Vietnam War, this is a fascinating, informative look at the LBJ side of the war--how he didn't want to get in it, how he wanted to focus on a domestic agenda, and how his advisors (except for a few) were strongly of the other opinion.  Alec Baldwin does his best non-comedic acting job here as Robert McNamara, the long-standing Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and LBJ.  The movie focuses none on battle scenes, but all on the reasons and thinking behind the U.S. escalation of troops from the beginning of LBJ's presidency to its end.  That said, it's a fascinating movie, even though it has no ""action"" scenes.  Michael Gambon is fantastic as LBJ, capturing well his struggle and emotional agony over the war, which he doesn't want, but for which he's blamed.  Donald Sutherland and Bruce McGill also put in top-rate performances.  This was the most enjoyable movie I've seen in quite a while.",1439164800,3,942,4.742331288343558
1821689,4,B00007M55V,"Good historical drama about the presidency of LBJ and his struggles with poverty, civil rights, etc. but at first underneath, and then consuming all of that was Vietnam. Interesting how LBJ considered the Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese just another politician or specail interest that he could buy off. What he never realized was that Ho was an idealist who wanted his country united and free from foreign domination.

It's interesting to see how LBJ, one of the nation's best politicians, could never understand that. It reminds us that we should always understand our opponents on their terms, rather than try to fit them into our own catregories.

However, the movie *is* a bit preachy (and this coming from a liberal) and that becomes tiresome after a while.

In all, though, an interesting film to watch when you need to kill some time. I wouldn't watch it as a ""date movie"" or anything like that. This is more of a movie you might download for a plane flight.",1438819200,,971,4.7

Also, Eisenhower became a UN ambassador for the US - a clear MO of a peace advocate.

""Path to War"" demonstrates US intelligence was lousy and the American mindset simply could not grasp another culture's tenacious resistance to ""shock and awe"" techniques.

Excellent performances by Donald Sutherland, Alec Baldwin and Michael Gambon make it seem utterly real and contemporary. It is a long film but the length is necessary, as the film tries to show how the war evolved, and how it pulled Johnson into a conflict that he really didn't want to get involved with. You see how it became a journey into his own private hell. Gambon is superb at showing how the president was personally impacted by how it all played out. There are many scenes in which Johnson needs to make a decision and depends upon his cabinet to help make the right one. If you are interested in the burdens of presidential strategic thinking and the profound implications of decisions made at this level this movie is a must see. The drama reaches many high points as the loss of life and the hopelessness of the war just gets progressively worse with no solution in sight.

1821733,5,B00007M55V,"My goal is to not parrot the other reviews because some reviewers (and especially the spotlighted ones) have described this movie far better than I can. Instead I want to focus on the realism of not only the events, but the production values.

I felt as though I was whisked back in my teen and early adult years from the very first scene. The offices, street scenes, interior shots and even the clothes and uniforms are exact. I not only grew up in this era, but LBJ was my commander-in-chief, and I served under both Secretaries of Defense McNamara and Clark Clifford.

While I will confess that I did not know, care about, or appreciate the magnitude of the events depicted in this movie, research shows that they are historically correct. Or at least substantially so. At this point in my life I am seeking reasons why we were bogged down in Vietnam and this movie gives some clear reasons about the whats and whys. My biggest take away, though, is the behind-the-scenes machinations, personalities and the political realism.

Another aspect of this film that makes it an uncanny glimpse into the past is the resemblance of the actors to the people they portray. In one case Jack Valenti's son John portrays him.

For my generation, and especially those of us who were serving in Vietnam when the events in this movie took place, this is a collection of answers. Not that all of the answers make sense or excuse many of the decisions the Administration made, but at least we have some inkling of the driving factors. For younger folks I will attest that this film perfectly captured that period in America.",1386806400,4,1610,4.678445229681979

The viewer sees how LBJ struggles to cope with his Vietnam decisions; Alec Baldwin does a very believable job as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara pressuring LBJ to take a tough stand in Vietnam and arguing the military can easily get the job done. Bruce McGill portrays George Ball who was an early critic of the war and turns out to be correct in arguing that the war would turn out badly for the US. The viewer sees how badly LBJ is torn and tormented by the war as it continues and he sees no way out of it; you also see how McNamara suddenly flips his position on the war and then is suddenly forced out of the administration.

He never played a prominent role in the administration until he became Defense Secretary and that was at the end of the administration. HIs role in the movie was overgloried.

1821735,5,B00007M55V,"I continue to be amazed by the quality of films made by HBO for their subscribers.  Path to War is one more example of the excellence of HBO productions.

John Frankenheimer directs his talented cast with a sure hand.  Michael Gambon, the famous Irish/English actor, does a fine job as Lyndon Johnson.  He does not want the war in Viet Nam, but he is misled into thinking that first it was necessary to stop the spread of communism in South East Asia, and second that the war was winnable.  Robert McNamara, played convincingly by Alec Baldwin, acting on false information, convinces Johnson to go to war and for three years supports the generals such as William Westmoreland who continue to ask for more troops and more bombing.  Clark Clifford, well-acted by Donald Southerland, tells Johnson right at the beginning of American involvement in Viet Nam that the war is unwinnable, but Johnson ignores his good advice and supports instead McNamara and his generals.  ""Things fall apart and the center does not hold.""  His health seriously compromised by the tremendous pressure of his office and the disaster of a war that continues to escalate with no end in sight, Johnson decides not to run for reelection and the film comes to a close.

This is a film, not a history lesson, yet director Frankenheimer tries to stay as close to the facts as possible.  My guess is that historians will have much to criticize concerning the accuracy of this presentation of Johnson and the war in Viet Nam, but Path to War is not a documentary.  Its main purpose is to dramatize the impact of the war on the politicians like Johnson who are trying to do the right thing, but are sadly misguided by false information provided by the military establishment.  Many viewers will think about Iraq and Afghanistan and draw parallels with Path to War.

The running time for this film is almost three hours, but for me the time flew by as I had a chance to step back in time and relive the disaster of the first three years of the war in Viet Nam.  I wondered what it must be like to be president and to have to live each day with the enormous pressure of knowing that decisions you make are going to mean the difference between life and death for American soldiers and Vietnamese citizens.

This is the movie to watch if you want to understand why President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who won the largest landslide electoral victory in American history, and who hoped to be remembered for his domestic policy successes -- the ""Great Society"", civil rights, voting rights, etc. -- instead came to be remembered mainly for his foreign policy failures.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand how Johnson went from hero to villain in the eyes of America's idealistic youth.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand Johnson, the man, and how the Vietnam War affected him personally.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand what went on behind the scenes at the White House as Johnson, along with his family, cabinet officers, advisors, and aides -- Lady Bird Johnson, Robert McNamara, Clark Clifford, Dean Rusk, George Ball, Richard Goodwin, Bill Moyers, et al. -- dealt with the stress and uncertainty surrounding American involvement in Vietnam, while also having to deal with other pressing national issues, such as civil rights and the president's legislative agenda, as well as various personal crises, such as the health scare that Secretary of Defense McNamara's wife faced during one of the most tense moments of the war.  And this is the movie to watch if you want to understand how and why Bob McNamara -- the man who convinced Johnson to escalate the war -- ended up changing his position on Vietnam, coming to see the war as a mistake.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand how frustrated and divided the Johnson administration was over what to do in Vietnam, and how people's positions on the war changed -- in both directions -- as events got out of control.  And this is the movie to watch if you want to understand how Vietnam destroyed Johnson's presidency, leading him to abandon his bid for a second term.  This is the movie to watch.

Historically accurate, right down to the dcor of the White House, and the reconnaissance photos and maps that are shown to the president, this movie gets the audience as close to the reality of what happened as is possible without a time machine.  Prominent historians who have specialized in studying the Johnson administration were used as consultants on this film; and a number of people who were actually present when these events happened attest to the veracity of the movie's portrayal of those events.  This movie was directed by the legendary John Frankenheimer (1930-2002), who is perhaps best known for his Cold War masterpiece, ""The Manchurian Candidate"", starring Frank Sinatra.  This was his last film before his death.  Famed Irish actor Michael Gambon stars as Lyndon Johnson; and there are moments in the film when the physical resemblance is uncanny -- though I was never fully convinced by the voice (Gambon has a deeper voice than LBJ, and the Texas accent sounded a bit off in places).  In the two main supporting roles, Donald Sutherland and Alec Baldwin turn in brilliantly convincing performances as Clark Clifford and Bob McNamara, respectively.  This is a high-quality film all around; and I was very impressed as I watched it.  I'd recommend it to anyone.",1338854400,5,3615,4.8919803600654665
1821771,4,B00007M55V,"This is an excellent, historically accurate recounting of how John Kennedy's war became Lyndon Johnson's war, and should be seen by every young American born since that time as a way of understanding the essentials of bad policymaking and the temper of the times.  As a dramatization, it's absorbing to view while you absorb the history.

Watch this, then watch the many PBS Frontline documentaries about Bush the Younger's dance into Iraq.

I don't give ""Path to War"" 5 stars because two roles, in particular, fall short.

First, Michael Gambon utterly fails to capture the cadence, lilt and phrasing of LBJ's unmistakeable west Texas accent.  His failure (and that of his diction coach, and of the director himself) is so profound that the film deserves to be dubbed at some point to get it right.  At no point in this nearly 3-hour production was I able to really accept Gambon audibly as the president I knew, voted for, respected, and came to despise (Gambon's visual appearance is much nearer to Lyndon, but he's physically not as big as LBJ).  NB:  I'm a huge Gambon fan--his tour de force as an actor, in my opinion, is ""The Singing Detective,"" which itself is a marvelous piece of screen invention written by Dennis Potter.

Second, Alec Baldwin comes close to being miscast as Robert McNamara.  This is primarily a visual shortcoming; he (and his makeup artists, but also his Creator) are unable to visually deliver the unique appearance of McNamara.  Baldwin's hairdo is pert'-near perfect, but his eyeglasses are wrong, and most of all, Baldwin is cursed with a set of facial characteristics ('thoughtful' eyes and particularly a full, sensitive mouth) that just can't deliver the chiseled intensity and thin-lipped image that McNamara presented to the world.  His acting is okay, but not distinguished, and he strains to be credible in those crucial scenes where his searing conviction sweeps LBJ up and screws the president's courage to the sticking-point.  I would have looked long and hard to come up with someone who could have better delivered the McNamara persona.

Donald Sutherland is probably best of the principals, but also falls short of capturing the constantly grinning, reassuring, wavy-haired lawyer Clark Clifford--and of all the characters, the portrait of Clark Clifford seems the most revisionist and least accurate for a guy who happily ran DOD and the deepening war after McNamara's departure.",1335225600,,2428,5.067839195979899
1821772,5,B00007M55V,"The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It is also paved with navete, arrogance, and bureacratic stupidity. Watching PATH TO WAR, one is reminded that the best brains of a rich and powerful country, guiding a huge military that for all intents and purposes is invincible, can still stumble on a recipe for defeat if they forget to read their Clausewitz.

PATH opens with Lyndon Banes Johnson (Michael Gambon, who indeed bears a freakish resemblance to LBJ) getting re-elected to the presidency by a landslide in 1964. The former ""Master of the Senate"" has Congress in his pocket, and his head is bristling with plans to dismantle Jim Crow, improve education and health care for the poor, and build the so-called Great Society. Unfortunately he has a small thorn in his paw - this obscure Southeast Asian country called Vietnam, which the U.S. has been supporting against a communist insurgency with money and ""advisors"", but no official combat troops. Urged on by his military advisors, especially defense secretary Robert MacNamara (Alex Baldwin) and General William Westmoreland (Tom Skeritt), Johnson quietly begins to up-gun American commitment in Vietnam, with the insistence that the matter be resolved quickly. This action is opposed by Johnson's friend and advisor Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) and his undersecretary of defense, George Ball (Bruce McGill), but to no avail, and before too long, what begins as a military campaign is beginning to take on the appearances of a full-fledged war, one which begins to alienate Johnson from the people who elected him and to cause some of the ""the best brains"" to desert his slowly sinking ship like rats, while others flip-flop their opinions to such an extent that Johnson can no longer trust even his closest advisors.

I've become a big fan of HBO Pictures in recent years, and this movie is a good example of why. It features a crackling script, some truly terrific performances from an ensemble cast of veteran character actors too numerous to mention, and it does a great job of conveying the mounting frustration of Johnson as he realizes he has traded the Great Society for a war he didn't want and isn't willing to win. The arguments between McGill and Baldwin, Baldwin and Sutherland, and Phillip Hoffman and Gambon, are all beautifully written, as is the vicious scene where Johnson execrates sciptwriter Jack Valenti for deserting him at a critical moment with the cry, ""There's blood on your hands, too!""

Of course, PATH has some problems. It's portrayal of Johnson is very kindhearted, almost to the point of a whitewash, and it takes an even softer view of MacNamara, who many peace activists consider a war criminal and many combat veterans consider an incompetent who cost our military thousands of needless deaths with his arrogant micromanaging. Also, the portrayal of Clark Clifford, while enjoyable, remains a bit too enigmatic for my taste. But viewed overall, this is a very good film, part tragedy and part warning, whose moral seems to be, ""If you're going to go to war, go all the way...or not at all.""",1319500800,4,3096,4.984526112185686
1821773,5,B00007M55V,"The Path To War is a riveting political drama which clearly demonstrates how The United States managed to blunder into Vietnam out of fear and with the assurances that everything was going to be all right.  It shows clearly how LBJ was so afraid of appearing weak to any number of groups that he acted aggressively.  It also shows that he was the type of person who couldn't stand to lose and had a tremendous personal grudge in winning the war.  The portrayals of Robert McNamara are uncannily accurate and Alec Baldwin does a tremendous job of showing him as someone who believed that anything could be predicted, measured and accounted for.

What makes this movie so believable is the fine acting throughout.  Alec Baldwin is amazing, as Bob McNamara and Michael Gambon is great as LBJ.  Donald Sutherland is fantastic as Clark Clifford.  In fact there is hardly a weak link in this entire program.

In my opinion reviews really get down to personal views and feelings and we are all different.  Having said that I have just watched this movie for the 4th time in as many years.  I still feel as strongly about this movie as I did when I watched it for the first time.  Apart from giving an insight into the difficult decisions the Presidents of the USA had to make and their reasons for the decisions (and we would all love the advantage of hindsight), I wonder whether any of our political leaders have learned the lessons of Vietnam.  It seems that the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are mirror images of what is displayed in this movie.  Path to War is a gripping and intense lesson in the futility of war.  I wish more people would watch and understand it.  And I must add that the efforts by various Presidents to mislead and withhold and be untruthful about the real activities in Vietnam and elsewhere do nothing to change my opinion about the futility of this and subsequent wars.

1821788,5,B00007M55V,"This is a really well made film on a critical time in American history. This was the time that a lot of the greatness fostered by overcoming the Great Depression and winning World War II were squandered. Lyndon B. Johnson could have been a great President but fell short because of Vietnam and his decisions about it. What he did for Civil Rights in America in 1964-1965 was truly outstanding. This is depicted very nicely in the beginning of 'Path to War'. But then inch by inch he was drawn into the morass of Vietnam and everything that he had worked for his whole political life was pretty much destroyed.

Michael Gambon brings the disappointing Lyndon Johnson back to life. Though Gambon struggled a bit with the accent I thought he was quite good. It's pretty gut-wrenching stuff to see him signing paper after paper sending condolences to families of loved ones who were killed by his decisions. Also a telling scene is when LBJ looks at a newspaper political cartoon that has LBJ looking into a mirror and seeing the reflection of Barry Goldwater with the caption-""Who is the biggest hawk now?"" Gambon is also good at LBJ's earthier side and makes his character come to life. Alec Baldwin is pretty smug as Bob McNamara and captures the character well. 'Put the troops in' he says in a statement he will one day come to regret. The numbers game that McNamara played is well depicted. Donald Sutherland is outstanding as Clark Clifford and deserved the awards he received. He captures the slipperiness of Clifford well. One minute sensibly arguing that the United States has no business in Vietnam the next minute accepting being Secretary of Defense and saying that the United States has to see the situation through. Also, watch for a cameo of Gary Sinise as George Wallace reprising his previous work for director Frankenheimer.

Bruce McGill is also excellent in the role of George Ball trying to stress to the President and his cabinet how useless and wasteful the war in Vietnam would be.

It is really unbelievable to think that Johnson ruined a long and outstanding career in American politics by getting sucked into the endless quagmire that was Vietnam. It is really stunning how he was unraveled so quickly and to think how America went from the Johnson landslide victory of 1964 over Goldwater to Nixon becoming President in 1968.

The DVD has good picture and sound plus some really good text material on LBJ and the tragic war in Vietnam. The DVD does this HBO movie proud. This is just a really fine film on a very important part of 20th Century American history.

I'd say this flick is good at looking at McNamara instead of Johnson.  Anything out there regarding Johnson is always going to be a guessing game and this movie, in that regard, is no exception.

Donald Sutherland (Clark Clifford) and Alec Baldwin (Robert McNamara) are outstanding and Michael Gambon (Lyndon Johnson) also turns in a terrific performance of a President fighting the battles of ego and conscience. LBJ was a very complex personality and much of that persona comes through in the film. The eerie part is the comparison between then and now-a President from Texas, with two daughters, a divided country, fighting a war that doesn't seem winnable, against an enemy that is hard to quantify. In fact, it seems like many times during the movie you could just substitute Iraq for Vietnam and it would fit perfectly. Combines actual newsreel footage in the film making it feel even more real. Obviously, a very traumatic period in American history, this is a fascinating look behind the scenes at how we got into Vietnam and, finally, the decision LBJ made to start the peace process and not run for re-election so he could concentrate on ending the war. Sadly, he never lived to see the official end to the war. Watching this and THE FOG OF WAR, the Academy Award winning documentary about Robert McNamara, gives a great inside look at people behind the decisions that affect millions of people, here and abroad. You see the human frailties as well as strengths. At one point, LBJ was complaining to
Clark Clifford about the advice he had been given, and Clifford looked him in the eye, and told him that no matter what the decisions had been there were his and he alone had to take responsibility.

Many posters have said that without VietNam LBJ would have been one of the best presidents ever, which in my opinion could not be farther from the truth.  The inflationary spending on both the great society along with the war effort inflated the dollar to the point where the US subsequently could no longer honor gold in exchange for dollars and subsequently went off the gold standard in '71.

It's really revealing to see the degree which Johnson fought such a limited and overly-analyzed war.  In the movie, he is portrayed as having a huge amount of guilt of any deaths, on either side.  Look, this is war......either don't wage it......or wage it to win.

What is not known by many people is that militarily , The US was winning most battles and exacting a heavier toll than the VC was inflicting on us.  However, due to Johnson's (and his administration's) guilt and reluctance to wage a war to WIN, the peace movement at home who was rooting for the vc, and the media who was against the war and constantly referred to it as ""unwinnable"".....the Viet Cong leaders acquired courage and took heart.  These anti-war elements gave the Viet Cong the fortitude to keep fighting.

For example, after the Tet Offensive....which was a great military victory for the USA....our military having utterly repelled the offensive of the VC....the North Vietnamese leaders began to notice reports from the USA which were reporting the battle as different from what it was.  One VC leader was quoted to have said that he felt they were defeated after their route at Tet.....yet upon seeing reports from the US, by the anti-war US media, that reported it was a defeat for the US.....his communist troops took heart and knew they must continue the fight.

In several parts of the film.....Johnson and members of his adminstration expound upon how tough and unbeatable the Viet Cong were.  They seem to almost be fawning over the fact of the invincibility of the foe.  This coupled with the limited war.....over-analysis by washington bureaucrats on actually picking targets.....not letting the military sweep into the North.....lead to our eventual demise there.

After Johnson was voted out...because of his squeamishness in fighting the war....Nixon was elected.  He did his best to end the war nobly....scaling back troops while escalating the bombimg.  At the Paris Peace Accords, he created a truce between the North and the South which was backed up by the threat of U.S. military action should the North reneg and invade the South.

But, alas, the congressional democrats, using the cover of watergate, frantically went after Nixon causing him to resign, thus in effect closing the door on the South.  Gerald Ford subsequently pleaded with the democratic congress not to turn our backs on the South....but they did.

  The legacy that followed was one of death and blood.  The North swept into the south.  Laos and Cambodia were invaded by the commies.  Hundreds of thousands were thrown into conmmunist concentration and reeducation camps and in Cambodia....the killing fields ensued.  Children watched as their parents were murdered ( often beheaded or garroted )by the red regime.

Path to war covers LBJ's time from the start of his presidency to the decisions and influences made surrounding the events that lead to the Vietnam War.

the story covers Robert McNamara (Secretary of Defense), George Ball (Undersecretary of State), and Clark Clifford, who is good friends with LBJ and works for him.

all three men give their side on the situation in Vietnam and from there, LBJ makes his decisions.

it's really an awesome movie cause you really see two very different points of views, how one side saw Communism as a real threat and Vietnam as the battleground for it and how the other saw that fighting in Vietnam would never end and there would be no loser or winner.

Johnson goes from a loved and admired president after the fall of President Kennedy to a hated and despised man by millions of people. his Great Society is gone in exchange for the war, and all the politics and stress surrounding the times eventualy lead to him announcing that he would not run again in 68.

By the time he made his ""will not run"" speech, I hated him with all the fury of an adolescent of the late '60s.  Today, I think he could have been in a handful of this country's greatest presidents but for his tragic flaw.

This film re-rang all those changes for me.  Michael Gambon is truly superb--people complain that his accent isn't right, but they miss that his passion is exactly on.  You believe with him that there are wrongs in the world that must be righted, you see his vision, and you suffer his agonies about trying to squeeze between the pre-digested mythology of JFK and his fear that he will be remembered as the forgotted president who came between the Kennedys.

The powerful debate between Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) and Robert McNamara (Alex Balwin) over whether Johnson should withdraw from Vietnam or commit more troops may never have happened the way it's portrayed in the film, but I've never seen a better depiction of the moral issues of the time.  And with Johnson's decision to stay in Vietnam, you can't help but wonder, what would the world have been like had he gone with what Clifford called his natural inclinations.

From that moment, LBJ and the country are committed.  At one point, Johnson says, let's just get out of here, and Clifford tells him that it's too late.  And it was too late for all of us.

Another reviewer said this film was like a Greek tragedy, and it is, but it is really an American tragedy.  One set of options for the United States was forever eliminated by the decision to stay in Vietnam--we can't know whether that course would have been better for the country, but it surely could not have been worse.  This is the true Camelot that was lost, and its loss brought me to tears.

Johnson and his administration escalated the war in Vietnam during his single elected term of office (1965-1969.)

Afraid of losing Vietnam to the Communists, he increased the number of American military personnel there from 16,000 advisers in 1965 to over 500,000 combat troops four years later. By 1968, with the war becoming increasingly unpopular and American society becoming more and more divided as a result, Johnson had lost so much credibility that he decided not to seek re-election.

Directed by John Frankenheimer, Path to War has a wonderful ensemble cast that includes Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and Bruce McGill. Each of their performances is terrific. Despite his somewhat unconvincing attempt at a Texas drawl, Gambon captures the essence of Lyndon Johnsons larger-than-life personality and outsize ego. Alec Baldwin delivers what I think is one of his finest performances ever as the brainy, outwardly unemotional, and coldly analytical Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. Donald Sutherland, as Clark Clifford, and Bruce McGill, as George Ball, also deliver particularly praiseworthy portrayals of their characters.

I lived through the period covered by this film and remember it well. I think Frankenheimer and writer Daniel Glat did a very good job of accurately capturing what life and politics were like during this period of great and rapid social change in America.

 Path to War is necessarily long, weighing in at around 2 hours, 45 minutes. But it never really seems that long. Frankenheimer, Glat, and the cast all keep things well focused and interesting. This is a dialogue-heavy film, with almost no action scenes (the horrific  and historically accurate  suicide by self-immolation of anti-war protester Norman Morrison in front of the Pentagon a notable exception.)  Actors deliver their lines at a rapid-fire pace, which has the advantage of keeping things moving along nicely, but sometimes makes things a little hard to understand.

Despite a few minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed Path to War. It is now a part of my digital video library, and is a film I watch frequently. Highly recommended.",1491609600,4,2349,5.245333333333333
