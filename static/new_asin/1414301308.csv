175527,5,1414301308,I remember watching these videos as a child and I wanted to share them with my classroom students.  They are great for young children and have a moral to each story.  The best part is that my students love watching them!,1287532800,,220,4.341463414634147

175529,5,1414301308,"I used to watch the VHS tapes of McGee & Me when I was a kid. I loved them so much, and I wanted my daughter to watch them as she grew up too, so I got the DVD version for her and they're just as great as I remembered! My whole family (parents, brothers, husband) are all into the videos now too, and all I did was turn the DVD on! They have a great message with great actors and the set is definitely a perfect addition to any family!",1235520000,6,435,3.791208791208791
175530,5,1414301308,"McGee and Me is an excellent series.  My only regret is that Focus on the Family didn't make more of these.  The animation portion is very well done - much better than most current animation that I've seen.  The actors were well chosen - especially the main character, ""Nick"".  And not only is this series entertaining, but inspirational as well.",1215216000,14,346,4.716666666666667

7795535,3,1414301308,"Chewed corners and lots of scratches to each DVD. Haven't watched them all yet...only one actually and it was fine. I don't think I would have rated it as very good condition. Was delivered very quickly, though.",1364688000,,211,4.72972972972973

I bought them for a friend's little boy and he loves them even though they are ""older"" DVD's.  They make Bible lessons real for kids.  I received them in record time and in great condition.",1362441600,,309,4.275862068965517

7795541,5,1414301308,"I am a teacher, and each summer I have the privilege of keeping my grandkids while school is out.  I wanted videos that were short, uplifting, Christian and still relevant to issues they would be dealing with.  The McGee DVD's are absolutely perfect.  All four grandkids-- 2 boys, 2 girls ages 6,8 and 10 love them and watch them over and over again.  They are learning good values, applying scripture to daily life and still being entertained.  I highly recommend  this series.",1310688000,,478,4.7682926829268295
