8233084,3,B000YJES00,"This DVD is a documentary about polygamy, the cornerstone of the Mormon faith.
Former Mormon women and men share with us their experiences in Mormonism. One of them is Sandra Tanner, ex-LDS and the great great grand daughter of Brigham Young. Others were LDS who eventually converted to Fundamentalism  and others who were born in the FLDS. All these people eventually became Christians.
The focus of the DVD is to explain how and why the LDS church has apostasized from Joseph's Smith original teachings, the most important being plural marriage or polygamy, and how the Fundamentalist LDS are his real heirs.
They discuss about Section 132 of Joseph Smith's Doctrine and Covenants, (the everlasting ""revelation"" that portrayed polygamy as a source of spiritual blessings), and early Mormon literature that presents polygamy as a necessary condition to achieve Godhood, the reason why some of these people accepted to enter into this lifestyle.
I have found the first part of the DVD very informative and well documented. Historical sources and early LDS leaders' speeches are presented in order to enable the watcher to make up his/her own mind on the matter.
It is not all good, though. This DVD contains one error. The author states that the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy (Jacob 2:24-29), which would be a discrepancy with LDS belief. However, if we keep reading to verse 30, there is a little clause that says that polygamy may be allowed again if the ""Lord"" decides so.
It seems like Joseph Smith already had the ""divine principle"" in mind, he only feared the people's reaction! Once he realised that the ""saints"" were enthusiastic about the new ""law"", he only had to make it official.
In the last part of the DVD the persons interviewed describe the abuse and pain they endured in polygamy.
Even though their sorrow is totally understandable, I have found their presentation rather sensationalistic in some instances.",1327795200,4,1927,5.040752351097178
8233085,1,B000YJES00,"Another thinly veiled attack on Mormonism, in the latest instalment, they try to make early LDS polygamy out to be a hidden, forbidden, part of church history which it is not. Just as in their Bible verses the BoM, they twisted the findings, and used only those that would advance their Mormon hating cause. Perhaps the Living Hope Ministries would be better served by helping those in need, instead of attacking other Christian faiths. You can read the truth about the early year of the Mormon Church and polygamy at LDS.org or watch the lies.",1316304000,3,544,4.7368421052631575
8233086,5,B000YJES00,"As with the other documentaries produced by living hope ministries, this one examines the facts in a respectful manner. Throughout the entire documentary the teaching of polygamy is examined from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. The documentary shows the LDS first acceptance of polygamy, its leadership that practiced it and the LDS declaration to abandon it, in addition to the continued practice after the declaration was produced.

There was a contrast between the mainstream Mormons and the fundamentalist Mormons. The comparison showed fundamentalist Mormons demonstrate greater adherence to the original teaching of Joseph Smith. There are many first hand testimonies from former Mormons who embraced this lifestyle. There was a section showing how each member escaped from the LDS. It is not widely announced, but the pressure to remain in the LDS church is significantly strong and can create considerable family disruption.

At the end of the documentary, each person shared how they came to know the real Christian Jesus. They came to realize Jesus was not the soul brother of Lucifer, they would not be gods, they would not rule their own personal planet (standing beside their husband with his other wives) and God is not like man. They came to realize the Bible teaches Jesus Christ is God, there are no other god's, they were sinners and salvation is by God's grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus on the cross alone.

This documentary was difficult to watch, you could see the pain in many of the former LDS members in this video. It was great to hear the testimonies of former LDS members that found the true Jesus who was wounded deeply for them. Their testimonies are being utilized to comfort others who have suffered greatly (2 Cor. 1:3-8). I would recommend this to both of my Christian and Mormon friends.",1259884800,10,1880,4.980891719745223
8233087,5,B000YJES00,"Recently a pair of Mormon ""Elders"" came to my front door. The Lord moved me with compassion to care for these young men, and I wanted to witness the beauty of the freedom that I enjoy in Christ to them, but how? One MUST know to whom they are witnessing, and what they believe. Otherwise, how will you have a truly constructive testimony? It is the Spirit that leads in all things, but I believe in knowing your target audience! This video was very informative and I have NO regrets in the purchase of this video.",1244332800,8,513,4.354166666666667
8233088,4,B000YJES00,"The following is a letter I sent to the authors of the books mentioned.  I think it serves as a review.

Dear Sirs:

I would like to commend you on your excellent videos, ""The Bible vs. The Book of Mormon,"" ""DNA vs. The Book of Mormon,"" and Lifting the Veil of Polygamy.""  Upon viewing them, I remain amazed that any honest Mormon could still continue in his belief, after being confronted with the facts.  But that should not be so surprising.  I have noticed for years, how Mormons stubbornly resist the truth.

When I was in the Army and stationed in Alaska, I joined the LDS Church.  That was in 1958.  After I was discharged, I went to BYU.  But in my very first year I began to question the faith.  I graduated with a major in German and subsequently became a high school teacher.  Having some ability in linguistics, I went on to study New Testament Greek on my own and pursued my interest in hermeneutics--hoping to find the truth.

However, all my research led me down a path I did not expect to travel.  Many years ago, I came to the conclusion that the Book of Mormon could not possibly be true--based on the LDS interpretation of Scripture alone.  Today, I see serious problems with the ""divine inspiration"" of the Bible!

It was interesting to note a comment that was made in one of your videos.  You quoted Deut. 18:20-22, stating the test for a true prophet.  Since Joseph Smith predicted that which did ""not come to pass,"" he must be considered to be a false prophet.  How about Jesus?  Did he prophesy falsely?

Consider the Olivet Discourse (Mt. 24, Mk. 13, Lk. 21)!  Jesus' disciples demanded categorical certainty as to when He should return.  Without going into detailed evidence, may I simply say that Jesus predicted he would come again during their lifetime.  In fact, the writers of the New Testament consistently set a first century deadline for the second coming.  It never happened!  Was Jesus a false prophet?  Is the New Testament any more inspired than the Book of Mormon?

I can appreciate how hard it must be for former Mormons to acknowledge that they had been deceived.  It was heart-breaking for me!  Do you think it has been any easier to come to the realization that Christianity is just as untrue as is Mormonism?  After years of delving into Christian apologetics, that is the conclusion I was compelled to accept.

Do you really believe that the unsaved Mormon will be suffering endless torment in hell, while you will be spending eternal bliss in the heavens above?  I am surprised--even amused--that men of your intelligence and learning can accept such ""fairy tales,"" if I may call it that.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound disrespectful, and I apologize if I come across as rude.  Let me put it this way: I feel that you, as Christians, are sitting in glass houses and throwing stones.

Please, don't take this as a hate-mail!  I have no animosity towards any Christian--and certainly not towards any of you.  I looked at your videos and actually came to like and admire men such as Thomas Murphy and others who participated in the presentations.  I just disagree with your final conclusions.  Take it for what it is worth!

Sincerely,

Gosta Stride",1241654400,3,3195,4.632142857142857
