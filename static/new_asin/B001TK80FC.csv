3790954,3,B001TK80FC,"I don't write reviews for many things.
Keeping that in mind: This isn't a bad dvd, however I'm a fan of something that you push play and it goes through the warm-up and everything.

In other words something that keeps you going and in the groove. This failed.  It was like pulling teeth to plug it in and go through the ""menu play menu play menu play"".  If that sort of thing doesn't irritate you this is for you.

The instructor is the only thing that saved this dvd.  However because of it's ""Menu Play MPMP"" it's at the bottom of my stack.  I like the ""Body by Bellydance"" for the beginners (which I definitely am).  They are set up like a workout dvd but you get all the basics (figure 8, shimmy, warm-ups) in a smooth play, and if you advance in your ability it's right there (and all you have to do is forward).

But this one isn't horrible, it's just not with my attention span.",1282694400,103,885,4.226190476190476

3790956,5,B001TK80FC,"i have always wanted to learn belly dancing but can't afford a teacher so of course i turn  to the videos.  i have had several and enjoyed them but found myself getting lost. this one is different, at least  for me it is.  she has the video broken down in differant segments, so if you just want to work you arms one day and then work on shimmies the next you don't have to wade through a whole program to get to the section you want.  then you have a whole sections where you combine the movements you learned at the begging.  what i am trying to say is that i can work on just my foot movements until i have that down and then go to the section where is combine as multipal movemnts together. (that is where is usually get lost and fustrated). it's an added bonus for me that the instructer actually has curves, so i am not stuck watching a twig. it some how makes it more realistic and i feel more comfident about myself. it is SO worth the money and they shipped it to me in no time flat.  i got a great deal on this movie and since i have watched i would have [ayed more for it.",1282262400,6,1083,4.0093023255813955

She is really good at showing you how to do things with examples that are easy to understand.  The presentation works well as she shows things from all sides when describing what to do, such as how much movement is needed.  Very warm personality that is realy enjoying showing me how to Belly Dance.",1276128000,136,532,4.333333333333333

3790961,5,B001TK80FC,"This DVD has a couple of short sections to start - general introductions and cautions plus an interview with Leila, which provides a good overview of what to expect and things to keep in mind.

Then there are three main sections - Basic Movements, Intergrated Movements and Dances To Follow.

Basic movements has sections which cover Posture, Arms, Hip Circles, Hip Pushes, Basic Shimmies and Basic Camels.  Leile builds on each movement in each section and then at the end puts the moves together. Leila will show the moves from different angles so you can see what she is doing, and does not say ""left"" or ""right"" and shows ""one side"" then ""the other"" so it makes it easy to follow.  The movements are Moving with Shimmies, Egyptian Walk and Moving with Hip Circles. Then there are three more dances to follow and improvise to.  There is no instruction on the last three dances - Leila explains this is how dance is often taught when you learn more. There is also a perfomance by Leila to watch which is beautiful.

I have started to feel like I am able to do some of the Basics fairly well and gaining coordination.",1267833600,148,1118,4.565

3790965,5,B001TK80FC,"Have taken classes on a beginner level in the past, I wanted to share that with my teenage girls.  No classes available to us where we live so I went this route.  The instruction is very easy to follow and informative.  We are having a fun time with it, and getting some exercise!",1494201600,2,280,4.245283018867925

3790967,4,B001TK80FC,"About two and a half years ago, I decided belly dancing would be a super fun thing to learn.  I think there can still be a lot of stigma attached to this in our society, at least for the church going set, and I'm definitely part of one of those.  But I'm of the mind that what I do fitness wise in the privacy of my own home is my own business, and people need to drop the stones and the gasps and focus on their own lives and problems. And this can be a fun way to exercise as far as I'm concerned.

Basically, I was looking for a way of strengthening my core that wouldn't produce a ton of muscle there, because at the time I didn't want that.  And I find crunches to be pretty much the most boring exercise on the planet.  I even prefer sit ups to crunches because there's more motion in them.  I don't use this as much now, because when my son was diagnosed with Sotos, and I realized that his growth was going to come in way before his impulse control or ability to reason with him, I decided I better embrace my inner She-Ra and hit the strength training hard.  And I'm at a beautiful place where I love that I now.  But I love all forms of movement and still find this a fun way to move my muscles from time to time.

So this will incorporate more muscles then just the core, and I do like that.  I find that she does a great job of explaining and demonstrating things.  My only reason for marking it down is one of her outfits has a hole in the armpit and I find it distracting, and slightly unprofessional when it comes to producing a video that needs to be mass marketed.  I feel like someone from the camera or production crew should have caught that, fixed it, and if need be re-shot a few scenes.  I can see how she herself might have missed it, given the location.  It's a small thing that actually doesn't effect the quality of her instruction, but I think when you produce this kind of thing, those kinds of details send a message about the quality of your product to consumers. And paying attention to those kinds of details can mean the difference between people saying your product is awesome or just alright.

Armpit hole aside, I think she does a good job of breaking it down, and I do think this is definitely a fun way of working the core and I'm happy to have picked this up in my life.",1492905600,,2310,4.136465324384788

3790978,4,B001TK80FC,"This DVD is a great way to introduce yourself to an art form that is not as popular as other forms of dance.  If you are trying to lose weight, this is not the video for you.  But if you are trying to learn the basic moves of belly dancing and tap into the more sensual side of yourself through hip and arm movements, then you will love this DVD.  Enjoy!",1478649600,4,354,3.9577464788732395
3790979,5,B001TK80FC,"So glad to find this video! Leila makes beginner belly dance fun, practical, and accessible. She has a great presence - very down-to-earth. She  demonstrates the techniques slowly, with a lot of verbal explanation. As a very new belly dancer, I find her instruction easy to follow. I haven't gotten tired of repeat viewings - and practice!",1473724800,4,339,4.947368421052632

3790982,4,B001TK80FC,This is one of the best instruction videos I have purchased and I have purchased my fair share. The only problem with it is she has no warm up. Make sure that you warm up before you begin the video.,1472169600,5,198,3.975

3790984,5,B001TK80FC,"I find this DVD very easy to follow.  Leila explains the moves in a way that makes it easy to do and each segment is long enough to grasp the concept without having to restart it over and over again.  The progression is logical and allows me to work on any given move until I feel ready to move on, or to repeat any part as I need it.  What I've gained the most from doing this is an appreciation for my feminine body and its ability to move fluidly and sensually.  I find myself ""doing"" the moves, like the figure 8s, while standing in line at the grocery store -- not obviously, but in small mental/muscular moves.  I even used this at a workshop I was conducting on a feminine approach to weight management and body image.",1470700800,12,725,4.22463768115942

We have never ever belly danced before. We looked at a few videos online, but nothing was as comprehensive as Belly Dance for Beginners. Every little movement from your fingers to your toes is covered. We're still working our way through it when we can. The teacher, Leila, is amazing. She's very kind and has a warm personality.

3790994,5,B001TK80FC,This is an excellent dvd for learning to belly dance or just tone up using the individual sections however you like.

The instruction is very much for beginners.  She takes her time with every movement.  There is nothing at all gimmicky about how she approaches this beautiful art form!

In a month and a half, I have already begun to see definition in my arms, shoulders, tummy and hips!  But most importantly, my self image has begun a complete makeover too!

I decided to call this the very best, when it comes to a DVD learner companion or even as an introduction for a newcomer or beginner.

She covers the most basic move from simple step one, layering more complex moves over the basics with clear (sometimes long-winded but pleasantly conversational) explanations that even I understand on a very bad, stressful day (I usually go to class - but at the time I started this, I understood Leila a thousand times better than my belly dance instructor).  She also has a very precise technique (with an artistic, experienced eye on B.D. nuances - as she lives and performs in Egypt), so not only do you learn how to do it correctly, you learn an appreciation for the effect or meaning behind an arm pop (as she calls it) or shoulder shimmy.  This is an excellent way to approach any new dance form as a student.

Highly recommended :)",1440288000,,991,4.544943820224719
3791033,5,B001TK80FC,"This DVD is incredible! As an extreme beginner with very little dance skill, this video actually made me feel like a dancer! She instructs you clearly and gives you analogies to think about while you're doing the move to give you a better idea of what you're doing. At the beginning of the video I was very stiff and at times did robotic like moves, but by the end I was flowing and really felt good about myself! Didn't quite get all of the moves down, but with time I'm sure it'll get better. Also what I liked is she made me feel like it was a GOOD thing that I have some meat on my bones! As I was doing some of these moves  in my head I thought, ""great my fat jiggles, that's  real attractive... (sarcasm)"" but she actually made it sound like a little jiggle actually ADDS to it! This is an incredible dvd with an incredible instructor! I wasn't the least bit disappointed.",1440201600,3,878,4.251497005988024

3791138,4,B001TK80FC,"In addition to this DVD, I own Amira's Belly Dance 101, Sadie's Complete Belly Dance Guide, and Hard Candy: The Belly Dance Workout. So far, I have gotten the most use out of Sadie's Complete Belly Dance Guide and Hard Candy. I think this DVD is very informative. I especially like the instructor, who is very laid-back and conversational. She makes you feel like you're hanging out with her, gently drilling basic belly dance moves. The DVD is approx. 4 hours in length, which gives a beginner-level dancer plenty to work with. The first section comprises of individual movements, the second section covers how to layer those moves over footwork, and the third section offers several dances to follow along to that are based on mood. The dances are not broken down because, as Leila explains in the DVD, traditional Middle Eastern dance is learned by observation and not a technical step-by-step breakdown.

What I liked about this DVD: The Instructor, Leila, is amazing. She has a warm, friendly personality, she is pleasant to look at, and she offers loads of information. Her segment on arm patterns/movements is AWESOME. The drills in this DVD are gentle and low-impact, but still give you a decent amount of exercise. In each segment, Leila gives you plenty of time to master the moves; she does not breeze through the explanation, breakdown, and drilling of any of the movements. NOTE: This DVD is great for people who are serious about learning how to belly dance. People who are looking for a fun belly dance workout  that gets them dancing immediately are probably better suited for Neon's DVDs (even though people would get more from the workout if they have a preexisting knowledge of the basic belly dance moves, in my opinion.) Belly Dance for Beginners isn't necessarily the kind of DVD you should expect a traditional workout from, due to its length and its relatively slow pace.

What I don't like about this DVD: Every time a section ends, instead of moving on to the next one, it will go back to the main menu. This makes it difficult to really get into the flow of dance practice, for me at least. I find this DVD hard to actually work out to.

Also, the way she explains the breakdown of the moves is different from what I've learned from other DVDs. I think this is most likely because the instructor is staying true to the Egyptian style of belly dance, which is cool, but I feel like I have to relearn how to do the moves with this DVD. I find that it does not mesh well with other DVDs that I consistently practice to.

All in all, I think this is a great resource of information for beginner-level belly dancers, especially those wanting to learn in the Egyptian style. This DVD fits well in my collection because Leila covers moves that are not covered in my other belly dance instructional videos, such as arm movements/patterns and the large, sweeping hip circles. Also, she extensively covers shimmies, how to move with shimmies, etc. I have not yet danced to the choreographed dances, but I have watched all of them; they cover everything in the DVD, there are no surprises.",1404604800,8,3105,4.6899082568807335

There are a LOT of belly dance DVDs out there but somehow they are poorly put together: very little real instruction, the teacher is moving for 10 minutes and you can't keep up with her, etc.  This one is so nicely organized:there's a section on posture, on arms, on hips, etc. and at the end of each segment, she runs through the moves in a quick review.  I have bought 4 belly dance DVDs to date and this is my absolute favorite and less than $10 too -- you can't go wrong.

Leila teaches the steps in easy to use language and shows what all the steps look like.  The CD is divided into different categories for each different step and you perfect those steps before you move on to the next category.  Pretty soon you're putting it all together to create strings of steps.  Granted, I'll never be a belly dancer, but I can do the routine for relaxation and exercise.

I find this DVD fun and informative. I knew nothing of belly dance except for Zumba moves and wanted to learn authentic style.  The instructor breaks it all down very simply and gives relatable tips to help you better feel the move like, ""Imagine you're holding a basketball"" or ""Move your hands like you're wiping frosting from a bowl"".  She has you practice moving one body part at a time starting very simple and then builds upon the move in layers.  She also has the moves broken down into categories on the DVD so you can jump right to a section you want to practice specifically.

3791214,5,B001TK80FC,"I'm going to begin recommending this video to my students.  Leila's video is structured a lot like my eight week beginner class and when my students ask me for videos to practice with at home, this is going to be one of the ones on their list.  I'd also recommend it for advanced dancers wanting to gain more perspective and for a solid technique review.  Egyptian belly dance instructors who are looking for ideas to use in their own classes will find some gems in her explanations.  Non-Egyptian style dancers could use it for comparison-contrast with their own dances.

Leila is a big name respected belly dancer and if you have ever seen her dance you know why.  She moves well and connects emotionally with her music.  Her technique and vocabulary are authentic to Egyptian dance and the way she applies those elements to the music are culturally appropriate for the style.  Belly dance isn't just a collection of moves, it's how to use them with the right musical elements.

This video is *NOT* a workout video; *NOT* a shallow belly dance for your sultan-husband video; *NOT* quick silly thing to entertain you and your drunk girl friends; *NOT* American belly dance,fusion,or fantasy; *NOT* going to make you an instant professional level belly dancer after completing the video.

This *IS* a beginning technique video for authentic Egyptian Raqs Sharqi aka belly dance/Oriental dance.  One of the most affordable good ones on the market.",1369872000,16,1446,4.909465020576132

I am NOT a beginner in belly dance. I have been doing it for about 11 years now. I love it. This dvd should be renamed ""Egyptian for Beginners"".

A lot of negative reviews on here I think is because people are expecting a workout or don't like Egyptian. Egyptian styling is INTERNAL and very, very SUBTLE. But thats not for everyone which is OKAY.

I like that I am learning NEW ingenius ways of learning certain movements. Learning that smaller isn't less. Learning more therapeutic ways of learning things. I also enjoy her personality. Some people thinks she is too talkative but this is like a workshop, she can't see you and so gives LOTS of clear instructions, how to prevent injury, goes into common mistakes.

I think she is clear and concise.

The instructor breaks the moves down VERY well, making them easy to learn for almost any skill level (I got a little impatient, because I wanted to move along faster, but for those with less dance experience, the pace would be great) The different angles at which the moves are shown from allow you to see every bit of motion, so you can really learn the moves confidently!

3791223,4,B001TK80FC,"In short - This would be great if you are looking to learn the basics to really learn and master this as a dance style, and don't have classes for personal instruction near you. This would not be a great choice if you have about 30 minutes and want a quick workout video with some variety to just pop in for some tone up (I'd recommend something more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Fitness-for-Beginners-Slim-Down/dp/B00007G1VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down</a>&nbsp;if that's what you're looking for)

In more detail - Did you ever learn a musical instrument as a kid? Remember how you had to go through hours and days of scales before you could play one song decently? This is similar. You'll really be working the basics, which is necessary to do the intermediate or advanced routines correctly. Like many other dance styles, it is deceptively simple-looking when you see someone perform it well.

This is a good way to focus on and learn how to perform those basics correctly, rather than just launching basic routines and skipping some of the foundations like some belly dance workout videos may do. If you're going to cheat some of the finer points then it probably will seem overly simple to you (I'm thinking mainly of a correct shimmy, or traveling shimmy move, here.) It's harder than it seems, to do correctly, when she really breaks it down for you, but being able to do some of these moves correctly (subtly) and without tension are the main component of what gives an overall dance performance that riveting fluidity.

As others have mentioned, this is not set up as a continuous flow through the chapters of a DVD; there are menus and submenus and short introductions to work your way through. But - this is ideal if you returning, or do have some basics down already, seeking a refresher, and/or just want to target certain moves - as you'll quickly be able to determine what parts you don't need, and skip to the chapter you want to play.",1367366400,,2056,5.023460410557185

She tells you to be relaxed and what relaxed means.
Yes, you do have to play each section, but I don't mind. It allows you to focus on one section if you'd like rather than having to fast forward and rewind to the part you specifically want.
Leila is a great teacher. I will recommend this DVD to my friends.

This is worth the price of a bellydance class--and surpasses it because you can go at your own pace, replay sections you want (need) to work on. She breaks the moves down and relates them to things you're used to doing. The DVD is organized nicely into arms, hips, integrated, dance with instructions and dance with no instructions.

3791251,3,B001TK80FC,"Hi
I bought this dvd after giving a lot of consideration and reading the reviews.
Please see that this is not a bad dvd. Its just not for everyone. Here is my experience with it.
First day, I was very happy with it. It starts from the very basics, like ABC of bellydancing.
The instructer is amazing, full marks to her. She is funny, beautiful, sexy and instructs very slowly, explaining about each muscle and how it should be moved. She also keeps on mentioning about the common mistakes which you might make.
So, it is as closest to a class room instruction as a dvd can get.
But once you are comfortable with the technique and have understood it, then it starts getting boring.
It seems that you are reading a novel, but daily you must restart from first chapter.
So, this dvd is for non-dancers, who can learn slowly the exact technique. but if you have learnt any dance, (like i have learnt hip hop), then you'll be bored easily by it. This dvd won't interest you enough to go back and practice regularly after you have learnt the basics. So you tend to forget about the dvd then.
Also please note that this is not at all a workout dvd. This is authentic belly dancing teaching dvd. If you are looking for fast dj music and sexy moves, skip this dvd. This one here, is for authentic belly dancers trying to start dancing. The music is slow arabic, fit for the job.
Review- I am not disappointed by this dvd, but not very happy either because I lost interest in it very soon.
Pros- The Instructer, dvd starts from very basics, perfect for complete non dancers.
Cons- Boring after some time.

Also, the instructor talks WAY TOO MUCH, over-explaining things like she's talking to an audience of 4yr olds.  I was so bored and uninspired, that I stopped watching in the middle of the 2nd segment. And finally-- a petty critique, I admit-- the instructor has a big hole in the underarm of her top, which really irked me for some reason. It's like the producers and the instructor didn't even try to create a credible video.  This only cost me $6.99 + $3 shipping, but it was a complete waste of every cent.

I have noticed an improvement in my posture and the way I move. Would recommend this to women of all ages and sizes as the dance is a dance you can do alone and really strengthens you as you learn.

For instance, she will tell you the starting arm movements then add on and then it is altogether.  I like also have easy it is to move between the section, so if you have the first part of the arms down, just skip to the next.  Then the next set of lessons add to that.

3791273,4,B001TK80FC,"Leila is sensible in how she introduces movements.  I'm impressed by how much teaching comes on one DVD, particularly for the price.  The basic movement sections are each 15-30 minutes of learning.  For instance one is basic arm moves at 30 mins, another basic hip circles, another hip shimmies, etc.  Although she does sometimes say a movement is sensual or flirty, it is not a really sexualized DVD as it appears some of them are.  That combined with the fact that she's neither a stick figure nor hyper-busty and takes some time to mention how different figures can be a plus in the moves all mean that this might actually be a nice esteem-boosting get-to-know-your-body activity for teenage girls.  I like that some of the movements emphasize releasing your belly in pelvic tilts, as I grew up always sucking mine in to the detriment of my health.  The mindset behind belly dancing is a healthy one.

I have some serious illnesses and am very limited in how much I can exercise and what kind of exercise I can do.  I'm finding bellydance to be a relatively gentle body-toning exercise that still challenges me on multiple levels, is interesting, and is good for me.  Of course, once you really know the moves (and if you have a lot of coordination and energy) you could pick up the pace and make it aerobic.  I find it interesting that a lot of the arm movements are similar to things I used to naturally do when I danced in Christian worship (an old hobby of mine).

I haven't progressed beyond the basic movements, as I still don't have the hang of a few of those.  The thing I miss the most so far is having a a little warm up and warm down to loosen up after practice.  The most she does is have you lift your arms and breathe in at the end of a segment.  But you will definitely want to do something more extensive.  Additionally, the shimmy she teaches (the Egyptian shimmy) is the very hardest shimmy, and she immediately moves into layering it.  Granted, she is largely teaching Egyptian dance, but the hip shimmy can be viewed as the basis for the straighter-knee Egyptian shimmy and as a much more intuitive starting place.  I don't know about other people, but I still can't pull the Egyptian shimmy off much less layer it b/c I lock my knees shortly after breaking into this high speed straight knee shimmy.  I can only do it for tiny spurts.  It makes sense that she isn't teaching the choo choo shimmy or pharoanic arms and so forth (she is focusing on the most common moves), but with shimmies I think you really need to start elsewhere or at least give a lot more instruction as to how exactly we are supposed to keep our knees loose (usually she gives plenty of instruction, it seems, but I'm just not getting this one).

Prior to purchasing this video, I viewed a lot of teachers on youtube.  I also rented some of Veena and Neena's CDs which I generally do not recommend for learning dance as opposed to getting a little toning (they do not really teach technique so that it would be very easy to hurt yourself and develop bad habits; they also have floor or aerobic sessions included that would be terrible for most peoples' backs or knees and have nothing to do with the dance).  Finally, I bought an old production that someone else swore by that was mostly useless and had really garish costumes.  I do wish there were more conformity between the names of movements in belly dancing.  For instance, I did peek ahead at her integrated moves and note that what she calls the egyptian walk is nothing like what two other videos I was using call the egyptian walk.",1353715200,2,3587,4.4984567901234565
3791274,1,B001TK80FC,"I had a few ladies over, we tried the dvd and were pretty disappointed. The courses were dry, and not very engaging. We needed more interaction, more activity.

3791275,4,B001TK80FC,"This video is wonderful for learning bellydance.  I bought this video thinking it would be a little bit more of a workout video, but that was silly since it clearly states ""bellydance for beginners"", and nothing about workouts.  However, I watched it and did begin to learn!  She explains things in detail, moves at a pace so that you will get something and fully understand it before you move on to the next.  If you are serious about learning bellydance, I highly reccomend this for beginners.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I feel like she repeats herself sometimes, and it does move a little slow, which gets boring at times for someone like me with a small attention spand.  But I believe it moves a little slow like this because this IS for beginners, and she seems to stress how important it is not to skip over anything if you really want to learn.  Even though it moves slow it is full of information, and sometimes when you are serious about learning something from square one, it's going to be a little boring before it gets fun.  She is a good instructor and fun to look at! :)",1352246400,,1113,4.368932038834951

I would like to add that the dvd cover does not do her justice for how beautiful she actually is on the video. I would recommend this for anybody interested in learning belly dance.

I have tried just about every other form of therapy per my doctors that are out there now and none of them have stuck.  I have had 5 Belly Dancing classes so far at a school here in town, the Disability company I work with for Insurance even agrees with using the dance as therapy, and so far I am doing far better than any other therapies I have tried.  Though due to my disabilities I was still lagging behind.  My Instructor advised me to purchase a video and to make sure it had good reviews and plenty of steps and was for beginners ONLY.  I found this one and just in one session with the DVD when I went back to class she and I both noticed a big difference.  I would highly recommend this video.  Belly Dancing is not as easy as it looks and if done incorrectly someone could really hurt themselves.  This video explains and shows what to do and what NOT to do and I am very greatful for it.

The instructor is direct, and demonstrates each move.  This is not an excercise DVD, but rather a solid instructional DVD.  I would recommend a Yoga warm up before you start, as it's the best way to stretch before trying the moves.",1342483200,2,414,4.48

She is patient, has a great personality and is able to teach things clearly in an easy to understand way, including using some things we are familiar with to explain how the movements feel.

It is broken down with easier moves on the first levels then adds more to it, before doing the longer dances.  She is an amazing dancer and her final performance on the DVD is something I hope to be able to do one day - it is easy to see why she is well known in the Belly Dance teaching and performance communities.",1342483200,,664,4.2047244094488185

3791290,2,B001TK80FC,"This DVD is perfect for complete beginners to belly dance, people that have never danced before and don't have the isolation or muscle coordination to do the basics yet. She goes very slowly, and explains everything in depth, drilling each move for a very long time to be sure you get it. If you want an introduction to belly dancing, this is perfect. She does the moves very simply, which helps if you're a beginner, because you'll get your body accustomed to doing the moves small first and you'll get your muscles used to the movements. However, it'll be good for about a week or two, since the moves here are SO basic, that once you have them down, you should definitely move on. My biggest complain is that she goes so slowly, that even beginners will be saying ""Okay, I get it now, let's move on please!"" She also does need to work vocalizing her teaching. She speaks very hesitatingly, as if she's searching for the words to say and can't find them, and she says the word ""yeah"" ALL THE TIME. Literally. After everything.

But... if you're a more advanced dancer, even by a little bit, and you already know your basics, you're going to be utterly *bored*. I bought it thinking it would be a good to use as a warm up to get my body ready for the more challenging dances and moves, but it goes SO SLOWLY, that it doesn't help.

3791311,5,B001TK80FC,"I got this dvd yesterday and have only used it twice so far, but I couldn't wait to write a review. This DVD is awesome. I've always been interested in Belly Dance, and used Belly Dance videos before, majority of them are pretty bad. Some of the ones I have are so bad I couldn't even call it Belly dance, just a lot of shaking. This DVD is nothing like that, she actually teaches real Egyptian belly dance! And it's great because I adore the Egyptian style style! The arms section is amazing, she goes slow and repeats each momment over and over. This is the only Belly dance DVD I have that actually teaches you how to do the movemens instead of just following along. Also Leila is so much fun and has a great personalty. She explains what your posture should be like and warns you of when something is hard on a certain body part. I like also how she keeps reminding you to take it easy and be relaxed. She is also a lot of fun. I did 40 minutes of the DVD and I had no idea that much time went by because I was having so much fun. I think this DVD though can only be used by begginers if you aren't a novice at Belly Dance you might be bored with it, but since I'm very new to it I don't find it boring at all. Although I didn't attempt the following along dance routine yet I did watch them and they seemed really fun, I hope I can learn fast so I can attempt them :D If you are looking for a cardio workout this really isn't for you, but I do have to say that I felt a lot of my muscles working.

3791312,3,B001TK80FC,"This DVD focuses more on Egyptian bellydance than on other forms. The set was nice and the costuming quite good. The sound quality was excellent ... there was none of that distracting exterior noise, such as passing traffic and sirens, that I've heard on other bellydance DVDs. I thought the section on arms was helpful, as was the section on hip circles. For a beginner, those sections would work well, I believe. Also, Leila's reminders to take it easy and not to strain were very useful. But two main issues detracted from the instruction: (1) Leila went on too long about what not to do, instead of focusing on what to do and showing it properly done and (2) she had a habit of saying ""Yeah"" all the time, which, after about 20 minutes, really made her hard to listen to.

I do not see how anyone could possibly get much value from watching the DVD more than once, as it was not geared to help you practice the moves, but consisted mostly of Leila talking. There really should have been a drill section in which the steps were repeated without Leila interrupting herself with examples of what ""not"" to do. In addition, the section in which you normally can view and learn choreographed dances was nothing but improvisations. I certainly don't need to see the instructor improvise. I need to see her provide choreography I can follow. If I want to improvise, I'll do it myself. That's the whole purpose of improvisation, actually.

On top of all this the video editors were too eager to make cuts that detracted from the video and made it hard for a viewer to follow Leila's movements. In one improvised dance, the video editing actually made her dancing look distorted, proving that just because editing software offers an effect doesn't mean someone should use it. As for the performance section, every time I thought I could see what was going on, the video would cut to another view, then cut again. That's not good instruction.

This is the only DVD of Leila's that I've purchased, and it could very well be the last. It's a shame that with such a professional set there was not a more professional approach, and that includes video editing.",1327881600,5,2149,4.635170603674541

3791318,5,B001TK80FC,"I love this Belly Dance For Beginners dvd, starring Leila of Egypt. I love how slowly she teaches the movements, making it easy for me to remember them.  She slowly incorporates little movements with what she has just taught, making them easy to add. Sometimes, I had questions about what I was doing wrong, and intuitively, Leila answered my question, as if she heard me!

I love that Leila talks about belly dancers with ""a little meat"" on them, how, in her opinion (and mine), that improves the look of the dance.  Even though the meatier belly dancers are not model skinny, they are quite strong, yet sensual.

She DOES NOT believe in the ""No Pain, No Gain!"" philosophy. As a matter of fact, she stresses that belly dancing should feel good and not hurt. I felt energized, working my ""core"".

I hope to be a beginner for quite a while. I really want to understand the techniques at my own speed.

3791319,5,B001TK80FC,"I'm a beginner bellydancer. This is a great dvd.  She is a really good teacher, she breaks everything down really well.  There is plenty of practise for each move.  I followed all the beginner practises easily.  When I got to the moving practises I had trouble with this, did them but struggled, which is good, so when I improve can come back to it (I think it takes time to learn and integrate the movements into muscle memory).  Haven't done the dances with no instruction yet, but they look really good and will when my basic skills improve.  Her peformance I thought was like watching someone in a restaurant dance, avoiding obstacles, it didn't seem to flow, it was like she was distracted and her costume was a little bit gaudy.  But she is very beautiful and has a nice voice and I felt uplifted by her positivity.  The menu is very slow, it fades in slowly so you have to wait when you want to click onto something, I just had a little rest while waiting.  There is no stretching or official warm-up.

It is great to be able to have this right here in front of me.

You don't always know what you'll get when you order something like this, but I have to say I am very pleased & enjoying this dvd.  Leila is a lovely woman with a pleasing voice & manner about her...she makes a woman feel good about her body, no matter what size, in fact, she explains that having that little extra can be beneficial in belly dancing.  The main thing I like is how she explains the moves, she really knows how to explain in a way that simplifies & sticks with the student.

I loved the music so much that I have just bought two of her belly dance music cd's and look forward to practicing to these as well.  Thanks to Leila for a great dvd!",1319760000,2,755,4.215277777777778
3791331,3,B001TK80FC,"I haven't watched the whole video yet, so I may edit this later to reflect that, but there are some immediate issues that I wanted to bring up.

1. Leila doesn't look all that comfortable talking to the camera, and it makes it a little awkward listening to it.

2. Camera shooting and editing errors make it difficult to follow along. I've been taking beginning belly dance classes for two years now.  I'm not great at it - which is why I got a couple of DVDs to help me get some better practice at home. However, the way the videographer captured the shots and the editor put the sequences together makes it really difficult to follow along in some places.

2a. Arms. In belly dance it is VERY common to have your arms over your head doing intricate hand motions. Somehow the camera cuts off her arms above her head nearly every time. Makes me want to yell at the screen ""I know she's doing a hip shimmy, she's been doing the same one for the last five minutes - can you please pan up to her arms when she raises them so I can copy the hands too???""  This is an issue in the instruction portion (even the ""arms"" section - mind-boggling) and in the ""follow the teacher"" section. (or as my current instructor calls it - ""follow the bouncing butt""!)

2b. Follow the bouncing butt section :) - the editing of this section is terribly distracting. I would have been delighted to have the camera do just a single full-body angle, and stay there the whole time. I'm used to following a live instructor, so I can focus anywhere on her body to match to mine whenever I need to or see that she's moving. The video keeps switching shots while she's moving, making it difficult for me to follow along with. I'll be focusing on my arms and then it cuts to a shot of her hips and I lose focus, or while she's stepping it will cut to a shot of her arms and when it comes back to a full body shot she won't be where I expected her to be because I wasn't able to match my steps to hers. So, for watching, the editing is fine but for following along, not so much.

3. Music - just not a fan of the music. I know Leila wrote it and I feel bad for dissing it, but it just wasn't fun to listen to.  I like to dance to songs that make me feel like I can't help but to move along to the music, and hers weren't calling to me as much as the traditional Egyptian songs my teacher uses in class.

4. Performance - Don't get me wrong, it was nice that she included a performance of her dancing, but I wish it had been a showier piece. Again, I wasn't a fan of the music, and while she danced well, I felt like I was expecting a performance that matched up to the level of the costume on the front of the package. Nowhere on the DVD does she wear that outfit, sadly :  or that I've found so far at least  It was a nice enough performance, and it was a nice level that I could conceivably get to (after lots of practice) - it just wasn't what I was expecting to see.  The Neena and Veena exercise video that I got has over 15 minutes of them in full on performance mode and was more what I was expecting from Leila's video.

So, to sum up, all the issues above being said, I will still continue to give the video a shot, there were some explanations of some of the basics that I haven't heard described like that that were helpful for me. However, as I've seen mentioned in other reviews, there's a lot of basic nuances that she doesn't mention, maybe for time issues, maybe they'll be in another video.  If you're looking to learn belly dance, your best bet is to find a reputable teacher. A video like this is good for review and practice, and perhaps to expose yourself to the basics before going to a class, but don't assume you can just watch a DVD and know all the basics to belly dance (or any dance, really!)",1319760000,25,3788,4.150068212824011
3791332,5,B001TK80FC,"I received this DVD for my birthday. I haven't made my way through the whole thing yet, but I am already in love with it! The thought of learning to bellydance can be a bit daunting.. but Leila walks you patiently through each step. You seriously get a whole lot of bang for your buck with this DVD. It's less than ten dollars, and you get hours of material to practice with. Leila makes what could easily be confusing make sense. Sometimes I get a little bored because she does move through the material so slowly, but I realize that by her staying on each move for so long, I'm getting much needed practice :) The longer you practice, the more natural the movements become to your body.

3791336,5,B001TK80FC,"Belly Dance for Beginners is worth a look.

 In this video, Leila carefully breaks down each basic move, then builds up to incorporating the basic moves into simple combinations that are integral to Egyptian dance. As a seasoned professional who first learned belly dance in the 1980s, I can really appreciate that she teaches the moves that are specific to Egyptian belly dance. She repeats each section for a nice long 20+ minutes which are great for warm-ups for experienced dancers, and gives beginners time to to warm up and strengthen their mucsles for the dance as well as really learn the moves well. The DVD is divided into sections so you can view sections as you prefer.

Leila teaches some great combinations and choreographies that the student learns by following the teacher as she dances, in a non-verbal instruction, using contemporary Egyptian music.

Leila is lovely to watch, and her warmth and friendliness really comes across.",1315008000,,947,5.012738853503185

The main menu has a general introduction to Interview with Leila, which the DVD says to watch first and it is a good idea.

Then from there you can select one of three sections.  Basic Movements, Integrated Movements and Dances.  Each section lists all the lessons so you can select which one you want, and the lessons range from 15-30 minutes generally.  One or two a shorter and a couple are longer, but they are good lengths to get into during the day.  Each section also has a small introduction of about a minute which are also worthwhile to watch at least once to get a general idea about belly dance and what you will learn.

Overall she is a very good teacher which makes things easy to understand.",1312156800,,796,4.266666666666667

3791347,4,B001TK80FC,"I really like the content of the video. Leila does a great job of explaining the moves and gives lots of encouragement and precautions. It is a beginners DVD and does not include any choreography. The sections are well defined and focus on just one movement from the most basic way to use it to more advanced. She reminds you constantly to be patient and smile while teaching these moves.

The routine sections are very different from what we (in the US) are used to. It is a I dance you follow instruction which I find refreshing and helps free my creativity. Many people do not feel this way tho and really don't like that teaching style.

What I did not like was the menu. It did not have a play all option so you had to constantly go back to the main menus and sub-menus. Also the last section where she performs there are lots of camera jumps. I could not see her feet or what she was doing all the time.

Over all I really enjoyed the DVD. I feel it is defiantly worth the price and I hope on day to be able to take a workshop from Leila!",1311552000,,1044,4.158415841584159

For instance she will turn her side to the camera after showing a move to show the height at her shoulders or hips for placement.

A real big plus to make sure you see what she is doing.

When she is done showing the moves (you work through them and build up) it is then all put together so you can just do the moves.

I think it is because I personally prefer Leila's teaching style. She is a very beautiful lady who knows what she's talking about! She explains everything very thoroughly while she is showing you. Even something so small as getting the correct posture down - other DVD instructors have only briefly touched on that and it wasn't enough for me. There are many things that can go wrong with the posture and Leila tells you about all of them. She also tells you how to avoid errors in the movements she teaches. I also like it that she herself is talking while she is teaching, rather than her demonstrating and not saying anything with a recording of her talking put over it.

The DVD is a little annoying in that you can't just play all of the sections back to back. It is just a small annoyance but it doesn't bother me very much.",1309996800,4,1005,4.345744680851064

Basics:

Posture
Arms
Hips Circles
Hip Pushes
Basic Shimmies
Basic Camels

She teaches the moves so that they are easy to understand and says things that you normally do, or at least know, to give you a sense of how the movements will feel when you do them.

Intergrated Movements:

You learn to move more with the things you learned in the basics.

Moving With Shimmies
Egyptian Walk
Moving With Hip Circles

Like the Basics, she relates things to what you know so you can understand how to do the walks/movements.

The last section is follow along dances using the moves.  Leila explains that is a tradtional method of teaching - when you have alot of the moves down, you follow along.  It is a lot of fun.

Her experience as a teacher and performer comes through well in teaching Egyptian style of Belly Dance as she breaks things down in each move then increases what you do.  She make things very easy with her explainations, often relating the moves to things we do everyday as examples of how the movements work.

Her performance piece is inspiring, as I know when I get the move down I will be able to to that.",1298592000,,508,4.56043956043956

She walks you through every step, giving you different views of herself doing it while explaining how you should and should not do it at home. I LOVE it and use it every day. It's important to note that it's a slow start, and you're not burning fat so much as building muscle :)",1297987200,2,393,4.253333333333333

Leila is different and knows how to teach a beginner.  She brings you along carefully through all the moves, showing you the proper positioning in detail the brining it all together.

She is alot of fun with a good sense of humor thrown in now and again to keep you smiling.  My friends and I have been doing this together and we feel like we are making good strides in learning how to do this.

I am a beginner and know that First timers should not start not with the fast shimmy of the hips we all picture when we think of belly dancing but this was beyond slow. one of her choreographed dances has her moving ONLY her arms for the first 4 minutes, no hips whatsoever. She also seems kind of like an awkward teacher. she knows what shes doing but its like shes reading off a TelePrompTer the whole time.

I've done at least an hour of it almost every day since I got it.  The instructor is a doll.  So easy going, easy to listen to, very casual teaching style and just watching her do even the simplest moves makes me want to learn.  I didn't expect any real ""workout,"" but I have to say that I do feel it in my abs and thighs (in a good way), and when I do the arm segments my arms do start to get a little tired too.  Bottom line, if you ever wanted to try belly dancing, get this DVD.  It's fantastic.",1295308800,,622,3.84251968503937

3791443,5,B001TK80FC,"The basic layout of this video is well explained by other reviewers, so I thought I would add what I thought fulfilled my pretty high expectations of this DVD.  In short - the best belly dancing video I've ever used, although not for heavy duty aerobic exercise.

1) There is much more content than I had realized.  I thought that at 10-30 minutes per ""section"", and 3 main areas of the video (intro/basic moves, layering, performance by Leila), that I would have around an hour of usable material on this DVD.  the Intro/basic moves section has *6* subsections, each at 10-30 minutes!  The first basic moves section of the disk is very thorough and you can choose your workout for length and content by picking multiple of the 6 subsections (posture/arms/shimmies/hip movements/undulations/camels).  What a good value!  Also the only video I've seen to have a good 20 minutes dedicated to arm movements alone.

2) My friends and I really like Leila!  This is definitely subjective, but her attitude, teaching style, personality, and body type had us feeling comfortable, learning a lot, and best of all - having fun!  We were doubled over in laughter sometimes and very seriously working on our posture and movements at other times.  It was nice not to stare at a body-builder's physique for an hour of belly dancing, also.  I think having a teacher with a reasonable amount of body fat helps to properly show the effect of the movements we were learning.

3) This is definitely a technique video more than an aerobic video, at least in the basic moves section (though don't get me wrong! our arms and abs were tired after working out for an hour on this video!)  Furthermore (based on my pretty limited research into belly dancing), this is a primarily traditional Egyptian technique video.  There are of course other influences, but it definitely is more traditional than a lot of the tribal or more aerobic exercise themed videos that I've seen.",1294790400,22,1949,4.828313253012048
3791444,5,B001TK80FC,"This has been the best bellydance dvd I have bought so far. While its not much of a workout, technique and form are most important here. Leila is an excellent teacher and she's very slow and methodical with her explenations. This is perfect for a novice like me! I love it!",1294617600,,273,4.372549019607843
3791445,4,B001TK80FC,"The speed of this DVD is set at a good pace for COMPLETE beginners.  Leila goes slow to allow you to learn the moves and it definitely works your abs despite the slow movements!  I love the music and am going to buy her Sukara CD with the music featured on this DVD.  I also recommend purchasing a belly dancing scarf to practice your movements with.  It helps you feel 'exotic' and not like you are exercising.

Also purchased Belly Dance First Steps with Neon.  This DVD has a quicker pace and allows you to practice the moves you learned with Leila, although Neon's style is more American tribal, while Leila's style is mostly Egyptian.  There are enough similarities to link the two in practice. But Neon's DVD is also great exercise!

Really wish Leila would make another DVD to follow-up this one.",1294531200,2,803,4.566433566433567
3791446,5,B001TK80FC,"I admit it.  I am a klutz, born with two left feet.  I'm nearly 50 and I'm not in the best shape.  I have taken belly dance classes in the past, and I despaired of ever being able to attempt it.  Enter Leila of Cairo.

Leila is funny, unassuming, and wholly natural behind the camera.  She doesn't put on a saccharine, obviously fake smile.  One gets the notion that she is simply being herself.  Yet, she explains each move slowly, telling the viewer which muscles should feel the work.

The primary strength of this DVD to me is the sheer amount of time Leila spends on each set of movements.  For example, the hip circles section is about 37 minutes.  She starts with the simplest movements and drills them (but gently, and in a fun, companionable way so that one doesn't feel one has been ordered about by a drill sergeant.)  Without my noticing it, I was able to increase my range of motion and execution of the move.  She then moves to the more complicated movements, one step at a time, until before one knows it, one is doing horizontal and vertical figure 8s.  This is a move I have never before been able to execute - but keep in my age and my reforming couch-potato lifestyle.

The entire DVD is about 4 hours in length, so one gets a great bang for one's buck, and it's all instruction that coordination-challenged folks like me can assimilate.  Her warm and thorough presentation of the basic movements is superb.

The only flaws in this dvd are:

as another reviewer has noted, the poor menuing system is irksome;

there is no warm-up so I suggest that you purchase another DVD for that purpose; and

again, as another reviewer has noted, the dance-to-follow has no instructions - however, Leila notes that this is the traditional way for a senior dancer to teach a novice - but, again, she suggests that you master the first two sections before you attempt the dance-to-follow.

All in all, this is a wonderful DVD.  I never thought I'd be able to belly dance, but I'm beginning to see results!  No wonder this is the top seller on Amazon.",1294012800,118,2054,4.491891891891892

Lovely lady, great manner, great teacher, and well thought out and set up DVD.

Easy navigation and hours of quality production.

Can't speak highly enough of it, I made comment that another great dVD I bought was over priced - this is underpriced and underated I think

Well done Leila - I wish she would do a second one for the next level.

I use in conjuction with Jenna and Autumn and feel I have 3 great teachers - all different styles but all contributing and complimenting each other.

Definately worth having in your collection and probably the best 'first' dvd I have. And one that I would never sell on as I love her so much :-)",1293926400,3,804,4.2781456953642385
3791448,5,B001TK80FC,"This is a very good DVD.I have never bellydanced before. I like how she explains as you go along what muscles you should be using (you could be using the wrong muscles and strain them) when you bellydance. Also explains that you will be using muscles that you don't use on a daily basis. I have not been using the DVD for very long but,I can feel those muscles that have been sleep for so long. The more you do the video the more smoother my movement has been,she also emphasizes on your posture in the video and in every routine she teaches you step by step and most of all slowly,not to fast to where you cannot keep up. Over all I enjoy the video each section is a least 30 min or longer.

I was pleasantly surprised that it's actually giving me a workout too.  These movements use muscles and have me moving in a way that's different and I'm especially feeling and seeing it in my core.

I'm still very much a beginner and needed a DVD that would do the same thing as my instructor does -- walk me through every movement.  Leila does that.  It's like she's right in front of me.  I don't have to keep skipping back and repeating movements.  She repeats them many times.  And when it's starts to get boring because I finally have the steps down, I can skip ahead.  But I usually don't because I'm trying to make the movements automatic, and that is only possible with lots of repetition (for me anyway).  I like the format of the menu very much.

I've tried several other beginner's belly dance instruction DVDs and videos, but none of the others really broke down the basics of the movements in a way that's easy to follow--this one did!  Leila is also careful to warn you of common mistakes made by beginners (many of which I was actually making before she explained what not to do) and how to correct them so as to avoid injuries and unsightly dancing.  On top of that, Leila has a very like-able personality allowing you to relax a little and actually feel like a graceful, feminine dancer. I really love this DVD!",1290643200,3,636,4.660714285714286

By now, I have an extensive belly dance instruction DVD collection and gotten to know what the market offers pretty well.  With this said, this instructional DVD is one of the best I have purchased.  What you get for the price and Leila's method of instruction is what makes this DVD more than worth it. While the DVD is not perfect, Leila's method of instruction is and that is what matters if your serious about learning and cannot attend formal classes like me.  For example, I have back problems so learning the camel as well as other moves have been a struggle but the way Leila explained it, explaining were to put your focus and intention, the safety tips given and ease of movement cause me to do it and I felt no strain on my back and was actually pretty amazed at how good it look so then I was thrilled.  Another example, I thought something was wrong with me because after all this years I could not get the shimmies then after watching her section on shimmies something clicked and there I was shimming with no strain on my knees because she explains were the energy focus needs to be.  The background music is great and very upbeat. She shares her thoughts about femininity and has a beautiful performance at the end.  Loved the costume.  Oh! and this is Egyptian style Belly Dancing.

You have to play each segment separately from the menu page. Second con is that the dance along choreography bits have no instruction.

She is a great beginner's instructor; I felt as though I was in a one on one class. She explains everything so it's very easy to understand and apply each movement. She takes special care to let you know where you should feel which muscles to use, and which ones not to use.  I have back problems, so it's nice to hear her calling attention throughout, to people like me to prevent strain or injury.  She is very detailed and goes slowly to give you a chance to ""get it"" before doing something else. This dvd is perfect for someone to try belly dance for the first time, and for people like me who seriously lack grace and coordination, who get confused easily. I feel like I'm actually keeping up!
