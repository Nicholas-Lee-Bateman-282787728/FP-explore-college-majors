2520965,4,B000EHSV6E,"Just how many Dr Doolittle films can they make?

Doolittle 3 could be entitled, the Next Generation. Kyla Pratt takes the reins of talking to the animals and center stage as she struggles to cope with teen age lonliness and unpopularity.  Her skill in 'animal' is put to good use as she even finds herself in the White House in the beginning of the film.

Clearly, the focus of this film is far removed from the original Rex Harrison production, but aimed at a Hannah Montana/Zoey audience.  In that, it succeeds well.

Look for it at your local video store.

2520966,5,B000EHSV6E,Very entertaining and appropriate for all age groups. My how she has grown over the years playing the daughter.,1201219200,,111,4.894736842105263
2520967,2,B000EHSV6E,"So often a series sits on its laurels and continues to crank out episodes and the audience continues to see them because they are not terrible. Then, inevitably, the makers vomit something out with the same name, it's atrocious, and they take the viewers' money on the half effort and that's the end of it. Doctor Dolittle 3 is therefore the end.

There was no point in making this. It lacks eddie murphy (they have him on the phone talking to his wife, but one cannot even hear his voice). Unlike the first two which were at least somewhat funny in a very goofy way (worth watching if you're dying to kill an evening), this was a sleep-fest--literally. About 25 min in I was in an epic battle with my eyelids, pulling out all the stops to stay awake and avoid the wrath of my wife. Alas, the eyelids won (don't they always?).

The characters on this are silly, the plot...oh, I don't know why I'll bother anymore; The movie is just bad, I'd recommend skipping it.",1182816000,4,964,4.440677966101695
2520968,4,B000EHSV6E,Along the same lines as the first two but with a twist with the eldst daughter. Comedy with a fun aspect,1182816000,,104,4.0
2520969,5,B000EHSV6E,"I like the dd3 alot i was told it wasn't good but i had to complete my collection, even though eddie murphy is not in it doesn't mean its bad or that its based on maya the youngest. I think that it  gives a new twist on the movie.",1164672000,4,230,3.693877551020408
2520970,2,B000EHSV6E,"Yes, it is true. They made another Doctor Dolittle film without Eddie Murphy, but that is not the biggest problem about `Doctor Dolittle 3.' No, what is really annoying is the bad script of the film which does not know its target audience. I thought the greatest merit of `Doctor Dolittle' franchise is the comical interaction between a human and animals. However, the second sequel seems to have a different idea about it because the heroine of the film, the renowned Doctor's daughter Maya (Kyla Pratt, returning as the same role as she did in `DD' and `DD2') thinks that her ability of talking to an animal prevents her from being popular among the class, for it makes her look so uncool and weird.

Can you believe that? If you are a 17-year-old girl like Maya living somewhere in America, and you can truly understand what the animals are speaking, you WOULD be popular. But Maya, who is desperate to fit in, would not see things that way. Instead, I don't know why, but Maya's worried mom (Kristen Wilson, also doing the same role in `DD' and its sequel) thinks of sending her off to a cowboy camp, where Maya meets a group of kids, mostly stock characters from another teenage comedies.

In fact `DD3' looks like a usual Hollywood coming-of-age comedy, and some set-pieces involving Kyla Pratt's character may remind you of the episodes from, say, `Lizzie McGuire.' You know the typical plot elements such as the rivalry with another female, meeting a hunky boy, and a brief musical sequence, etc., and all these things are done in a most familiar way. Plus, you can enjoy some fart jokes, slapsticks (like throwing eggs), and, yes, don't forget talking animals. But if the animals are not the center of the film's story, what is the point of making another Doctor Dolittle film?

To her credit, Kyla Pratt does her best, but even her likable personality and natural charms cannot hide the weak script and the lack of originality. Twenty Century Fox, it is true, has polished up everything in the film, so the images are clear, the production designs are decent, and those animals act and speak naturally, but if you demand something more from the film, you will be hugely disappointed with it.",1154563200,3,2201,4.7265625
2520971,5,B000EHSV6E,"Are you an Eddie Murphy fan? If the answer is no, than let me ask you why on Earth were you watching the ""Doctor Dolittle"" series? Maybe it was because of a younger Raven-Symone from Disney Channel's ""That's So Raven"" and ""The Cheetah Girls"". Well, here is the downside to ""Doctor Dolittle 3,"" Raven-Symone and, more importantly, Eddie Murphy are gone. So, naturally, the father and sister of Kyla Pratt's character are not shown in this movie. However, the voice of ""Lucky"" the dog is the same and the mother is the same actress. Now, how about the plot? Any good considering Kyla Pratt now has to ""talk"" to animals? You better believe it. I think that Kyla did an outstanding, above expectations job. When I put this DVD in and began watching it, I thought I was going to be disappointed (mainly because Eddie Murphy is gone). All I have to say is, the story line is great. You can see that the director made a very good effort with this movie considering (s)he had no Eddie Murphy and no Raven-Symone. The director did not cast someone else to play Mr. Dolittle nor someone else to play Raven-Symone's character. This movie puts the spotlight on Kyla Pratt, so to Ms. Pratt, you rock! Oh, one last thing, in the bonus features, Ms. Pratt tells you about how the ""Dr. Dolittle"" movies affected her life. You gotta check this movie out, literally! Go ahead and ""talk to the animals!""",1147651200,12,1384,4.562248995983936

2520993,1,B000EHSV6E,Totally inappropriate for young kids (under 12) and should not be rated PG.,1459209600,,75,4.846153846153846
2520994,5,B000EHSV6E,"Let me start out by saying, when I review movies or TV shows, it is solely based on MY opinion and how I perceive what I watch. I also do not find it necessary to repeat the normal information other people have already listed in their reviews. With that being said, onto my review.

This is your typical Dr. Doolittle movie. You have some sort of problem as the plot of the story, you have your talking animals, you have an adventure, solution to the problem, and of course, let us not forget, the happy ending.

For adults, this is probably one of the cheesier movies of the series. Why did I buy it? Because my husband is a big cheesy movie type of guy. He loves westerns, horses, and anything to do with the rodeo so yes, I bought it for him. Does he like it? You bet he does. Do I? I can take it or leave it. Like I said already, to me it is a cheesy movie, some of the acting is not the greatest, and then you have the dude ranch with rodeo themes. Why does that bother? As a former rodeo association secretary, I find myself picking out the wrong things and focusing on them, rather than watching the cheesy goodness of a typical Dr. Doolittle movie.

Overall, it is a cheesy movie that any young child (or cheesy movie fan) will like to watch. And hey, you could be watching something way worseright?

I welcome all input on my reviews like this. I just ask that if you feel the need to give me a ""not helpful"", please let me know why.",1457913600,,1442,4.157706093189964
