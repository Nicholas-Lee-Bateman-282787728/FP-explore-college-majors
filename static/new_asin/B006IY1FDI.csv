4992265,4,B006IY1FDI,"[SWEET SUGAR - 1972 - Directed by Michel Levesque - approx. 90 minutes] Phyllis Davis and her bountiful rack co-star in this formulaic (aren't they all?) Women-In-Prison flick that's probably better than most Roger Corman flicks from the same era. So, if you're a fan of his or this genre of film, it's a must-see/own, as it's probably worth more than one screening, assuming you're indulging while viewing and a fan of Phyllis Davis and her twins, who had minor but noticeable roles in a bunch of mid 60's Elvis and cult flicks ('Lord Love A Duck', 'The Swinger', 'Spinout' and 'Last of the Secret Agents'), and TV appearances on 'The Wild, Wild West', 'Beverly Hillbillies', 'Love, American Style', etc. She also appeared in another worthwhile WIP film, 'Terminal Island' from '73. A striking stunner with dark hair and curves to spare, she was usually hired to fill out a bikini or midriff blouse rather than for her acting chops. Unfortunate for her, maybe, but not so much for her fans.

Set-up by a crooked politician on a bogus drug charge while working as a prostitute in Latin America, Sugar (Davis) ends up on a female chain gang cutting down sugar cane for a sleazy doctor performing experiments on the inmates on a run-down plantation. The usual WIP clichs prevail, but most of the inmates are lookers, so you won't object to the by-the-books plotline, trust me. Naturally, a breakout is plotted and staged with the usual prevailing outcome precedent, but as far as this tired formula goes, this one isn't a snoozer, let-down or terribly painful to its core audience - that'd be you, if you're still reading this.

A solid example of the sordid, squalid cinema being cranked out during the drive-in grindhouse glory days (and reminiscent of many a Jess Franco Eurosleaze from the same era), you could do much worse than this flick, as most of us so often have. A decent, watchable picture with not too many blemishes but more than a few sloppy edits, this DVD-R was a bit better than I expected. That may not sound like much of a recommendation to some, but to others, it's more than enough to throw in your cart immediately.",1325116800,13,2137,4.726541554959786

4992286,3,B006IY1FDI,"This is a review of the recently released ""Collectors Edition"" DVD-R version of the film ""Sweet Sugar"".

""Sweet Sugar"" is apparently a relatively hard to find product of the 70's exploitation genre. Prior to this pressing there was only the 'Desert Island' version available in DVD format and I have, unfortunately, found the Desert Island product to be (generally!) disappointing in its visual quality.  I just purchased 2 other DVDs from the 'Collectors Edition' series and THEY (both) provided better than previously experienced renditions of the films presented - SO - I was hopeful that their offering of  ""Sweet Sugar"" would. like-wise, be an improvement.

Unfortunately - I found this particular DVD to have less than stellar visual quality.  On 'my' DVD player the actual film image played as a 'fullscreen' format image 'floating' in the center of the screen... so the 'size' was a problem.  It also looks like this DVD was dubbed off an old VHS tape - there were several scenes with tell-tale 'tracking' lines in evidence.  The color was fairly washed out and in many scenes the 'contrast' was poor - no solid blacks. This may be a case of 'this is as good as itz gonna get' - due to lack of a better original source print - potential purchasers should adjust expectations accordingly.

Technical issues aside - the film was fairly entertaining - it had many similarities in its' plot and ambiance to some of the early Roger Corman jungle based WIP films - particularly ""The Big Dollhouse"" (even including a bit part by actress Roberta Collins who starred in 'Big Dollhouse'!).  The simplistic plot follows ""Sugar"" (Phyllis Davis) the pulchritudinous star of the piece as she is 'set-up' for a drug bust and sentenced to prison in some nebulous third world sorta country. She is informed that her sentence can be commuted to a lesser form of incarceration IF she agrees to serve time 'cutting sugar cane' on a prison 'plantation'.  She accepts the offer and arrives out in the field with the usual truck-load of 'new' fellow female detainees. The prison gurlz are thence 'menaced' by the horny male guards, horny male prisoners, and also the evil doctor at the facility who is performing some 'questionable' experiments on the prison population - one of the more amusing of which - involves injecting a bunch of house-cats with a violence inducing serum and (literally!) throwing  the poor kitties into a cell full of the female prisoners - giving the term 'cat fight' a whole new meaning!  There are escape attempts aplenty, clandestine 'hook-ups', and a fair amount of female nudity on display as the plot grinds forward to a fairly predictable conclusion.  Phyllis Davis IS a BABE and the anticipation of when next she'll find an occasion to 'lose her top' is generally what gives one reason to keep watching this rather formulaic bit of vintage sex-ploitation.

Maybe, someday, somewhere, someone will 'find' a decent copy of the original print of this flik and produce a better quality reproduction of it - but, until then, this may be the best version available. These 'Collectors Edition' DVDs are pretty minimalist in their presentation format - no extras.",1421193600,12,3174,4.930581613508442

That was the primary thought going through my head for the seventy-eight interminable minutes of this 1972 film (apparently truncated from the eighty-six of the original theatrical release; I wonder what they left out), which dates from the same time as, and clearly aspires to be like, the often comparably-themed ""pinky violence"" classics then dominating Japan's B-movie industry. But while the pinkies - and, indeed, the better American exploitation flicks of the era - managed in spite of themselves to sneak in enough art, humor, social commentary and flat-out fun to transcend their minuscule budgets and threadbare plots, ""Sweet Sugar"" gives the viewer the impression that no one involved in this production, either before or behind the camera, particularly wanted to make it. With tons of great early '70s B-films from both sides of the Pacific easily available, there's no need to waste your time with the likes of this unless you simply HAVE to watch every movie ever to feature attractive, nearly-naked women.",1391040000,2,1056,5.181286549707602

4992304,5,B006IY1FDI,"TITLE: SWEET SUGAR opened in theaters on January 1 1973 starring Phyllis Davis, Pamela Collins, and Jacqueline Giroux. This movie is 90 minutes long.

SUMMARY: The movie opens with a feisty prostitute Sweet Sugar goes up to a room with a man and he tells her he has something for her and gives her what looks to be a rolled up joint. He tells Sugar that he has to go get something and leaves the room. Then two cops enter the room and arrest her on grounds of illegal drugs. Sugar is taken and thrown in jail and end is offered a plea deal that includes Sugar of serving two years hard labor cutting sugar cane at a harsh prison plantation farm. The prison is run by a wicked and deranged warden Dr. John who grossly mistreats the inmates by subjecting them to all kinds of twisted and inhumane medical experiments. Naturally, Sugar forms bonds with Simone her chief rival, Doleres and Fara. The women try to escape on several different occasions only to have something go wrong. After each time one of the girls is whipped, caged or is forced to be alone with the guards. Each day the women have to go out into the plantation to cut sugar cane. The girls get very little wages and what wages they do get they have to pay back for the food, clothes, and other things the girls need.

QUESTIONS: Who was the guy that framed Sugar? Why was Sugar sent to this plantation instead of another prison? What were the other girls sent to the plantation for?

MY THOUGHTS: I love this movie. This movie is full with action and drama and it keeps you guessing on whats going to happen next. I thought that Pamela Collins and Jacqueline Giroux were great in the roles as Sugar co conspires. However, to me this movie was about one person and one person only Phyllis Davis. She was excellent in her role as Sweet Sugar. This movie also used Phyllis Davis beauty in this movie also. Theres several scenes that involves Sugar that will get your blood racing. Despite what other reviews stated about this movie I thought it was an excellent picture. So based on the action, drama and most of all Sweet Sugar beauty and talent I give this movie 10 weasel stars.",1389571200,5,2144,4.436548223350254

8499032,3,B006IY1FDI,"Growing up in the seventies with the local drive in the only means of seeing films the majority of the time I was one of those who grew up with the vast number of exploitation films released at the time. These were movies that somehow had fairly good technical values production wise and lacked only in plotlines, acting and writing. It didn't make them terrible movies and some actually were quite good. It did mean that most were not award worthy and just plain entertainment.

One genre of these films that ran rampant were the women in prison films. The reason for this is that exploitation films thrived on reasons to show women naked in films without being overly gratuitous. They left actual sex scenes to pornography and instead made these movies which teen boys would flock to instead. Movies like THE BIG BIRD CAGE, THE BIG BIRD HOUSE and CAGED HEAT played alongside other movies that didn't draw as much attention. All of them feature a few common themes: women taking showers together, lesbians, an innocent thrown in jail, a black prisoner fighting a white one only to join forces before the end of the film and violence. One more thing they always had in common was that no matter how dense the jungle or work they did in prison their hair and makeup was always perfect.

Among these movies was the film SWEET SUGAR. It starred Phyllis Davis who would star in another similar film, TERMINAL ISLAND, with Tom Selleck the following year and who later went on to fame in the TV series VEGA$. It was released by one of those companies who thrived on exploitation films, Dimension Pictures. This was the same company responsible for films like THE TWILIGHT PEOPLE, THE DOBERMAN GANG, GATOR BAIT, INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS, DOLEMITE, DIXIE DYNAMITE, DR BLACK AND MR HYDE and a favorite of mine RUBY.

The film tells the story of Sugar Bowman (Davis), a prostitute in Costa Rica who is set up on drug charges and arrested. She is presented with an option, which she takes, to work off her time on cutting cane on a sugar plantation.

The plantation is owned by Dr. John (Angus Duncan), a mad scientists who is using the women on the plantation for secret experiments which are never quite fully explained. For some reason it does involve torture but he seems far too young to be a Nazi transplant who escaped imprisonment. Overseeing the workers is Burgos (Cliff Osmond) who rules with an iron fist. Osmond who plays the part was seen in numerous movies in similar roles.

Sugar does her work but often runs into conflict with another prisoner, a black woman named Simone (Ellaraino). Their back and forth banter offers little in acting ability and plenty of conflict. Also a part of the group is a 17 year old prisoner wrongfully accused. This girl is later raped by Dr. John which sets in motion the anger and combined efforts of the other prisoners to seek revenge.

The film doesnt offer a depth of story here and the acting matches. Some performances are fluid enough but most have the sound of a line reading rather than actors performing. But if you're a fan of this genre then this film will provide you with the exact things you're looking for. Nearly every box on the checklist is marked here.

While Davis went on to show she could actually act in films she made after the point in her career she made these, her obvious assets are what are on display here. Well-endowed but not overly so, she made the most of her looks to take on parts like this. It gave her the opportunity to make a movie and be noticed which led to greater success on TV later on.

No this is not a perfect movie and no this is not a movie that would be award winning. It is what it sets out to be, an exploitation movie that offers plenty of action, a minimal amount of titillation and a few laughs thrown in for good measure with some comedic touches. Two of the funniest moments for me were finding Dr. John, this sinister character, taking a bubble bath and a sequence where the women are trapped in a cage and the guards throw cats in at them. Not tigers but house cats. Hungry, angry house cats. The women end up scratched and bloody which is completely ridiculous and hilarious. Anyone going to see it knew what to expect and they weren't disappointed. If you do the same you will have some fun with this release on disc.

Vinegar Syndrome, whose praises I have sung before, continue to show they are ready, willing and able to take what most would consider something left in the trash and presenting it in pristine format with a few decent extras to boot. To start with this is the cleanest and clearest presentation you will find for the film with a newly scanned and restored in 2k from 35mm interpositive. The extras for a movie like this would be hard to find, more so since star Davis passed away in 2013. But there are a few including a video interview with Screenwriter Donald Spencer, the original theatrical trailer, original cover artwork by Derek Gabryszak and reversible cover artwork.

Fans of exploitation films will want to make sure they add this one to their collection. And those who support companies like Vinegar Syndrome will want to do the same. Lets hope they continue to carry on this tradition of rescuing long lost titles and presenting them in the best format possible.",1522281600,,5294,4.574894514767933

8499036,5,B006IY1FDI,"As good as T & A prison doll films get. Lots of costume changes, silly dialogue, voodoo, Philippine jungles, and corrupt prison officials thwarted by savvy street characters, and of course the very sexy and ""set up"" lead girl (she might be loose, but she's a good girl who knows the score darn it!). This film is grindhouse royalty, and a personal favourite. Phyllis Davis is a gorgeous creature, and a B movie queen. I recommend you use this as the appetizer as a double feature with either a fine Jack Hill/Pam Grier picture, or Davis' Russ Meyer flick Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.",1503100800,2,586,4.59047619047619
