8193204,3,B000PSUXJU,"In many ways its like Out of the Past goes western. Then I lean the screenplay was written by Frank Fenton and Winston Miller, both fine studio writers. Miller is best known for serviceable studio pictures (mostly RKO), many westerns with his high watermark being his work on Fords My Darling Clementine. Whats interesting is that Frank Fenton, who too working writer with a string of studio work with few distinguished scripts (Malaya, Garden of Evil and Escape From Fort Bravo). But a year earlier he had worked un-credited on Out of the Past. Boggles the mind.",1458691200,6,563,4.814432989690721
