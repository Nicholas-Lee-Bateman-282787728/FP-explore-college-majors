8599773,4,B002QQ7MMK,"A welcome throwback to the days of scaled-down, DIY shot -on-video horror in the woods like Savage Harvest, Summer People is that rarity in indie horror, a slow burner that takes its time to build atmosphere, characters, and creeping dread rather than assaulting the viewer from frame one with jackhammer effects and editing. This debut feature for director Scott Feinblatt follows four kids as they venture out into the boonies to stay at a remote cabin, and the local townspeople don't seem entirely comfortable with these ""summer people"" stirring up trouble in their neck of the woods.

Before you can growl ""I'll swallow your soul,"" the idiots are dabbling around in black magic, unaware that Native American spirits control the land and are still coexisting harmoniously (more or less) with the residents. Freaky little events like rearranging furniture set everyone on edge, and then things... start to turn nasty. Though obviously shot on the cheap (most daylight scenes rely entirely on natural light) and reliant on the most familiar plot in the horror handbook, Summer People distinguishes itself with solid performances by the leads (especially Neil Kubath, who could be an indie actor to watch), some surprisingly ambitious shocks in the second half, a creepy downbeat ending, and the aforementioned confidence to rely on story and pacing instead of pure sensationalism. Ah, and there's an animated opening and closing, too!

The DVD is presented in anamorphic widescreen, looking about as good as it could. Extras include a handful of deleted (basically just expanded) scenes with some additional exposition, a funny 15-minute collection of behind-the-scenes footage (most memorable for accounts of the director's accidental double entendres and an impromptu trip to WalMart), and galleries of special effects make-up, stills, and storyboards.
