1009479,5,6305326665,This was an interesting scenario where the husband never believed his wife.  Sounds like real life when relationships simply don't work,1377302400,,135,5.428571428571429
1009480,5,6305326665,It is a shame that Victoria Principles husband does not believe her when she accuses her father-in-law of trying to rape her... Her husband has her committed and she almost lost herself...,1374883200,,188,4.90625
1009481,3,6305326665,"This is a tale of family and covering up daddy's bad habits. A woman is sexually assaulted by her father in law, but fights him off.  When she finally finds the courage to bring the matter out into the open, she ends up committed by a greedy doctor and friend of the father in law then is medicated into a vegetable.  Her husband finally comes to the rescue way too late. This movie will either anger you or annoy you into turning it off.  Well acted but a bit far fetched for my taste.",1365897600,,486,4.148936170212766
1009482,5,6305326665,"A MUST for Principal fans! So many issues are touched upon in this movie; an oldie, but a goodie.  Go for it!",1363046400,,109,3.9545454545454546
1009483,4,6305326665,This was a very good movie. But it was changling. It made you think how could she stay with a man who doesn't believe you. Your father tried to rape me. And you are paranoid. It makes you mad and stay around to watch the whole movie to see where it leads. All in all it was good but some parts make you mad.,1357171200,,307,3.8125

1009485,5,6305326665,This is a good movie with victoria Principal in tbe starring role.  However I bought it because Geraint Wyn Davies is in it as a doctor.  This is a really good movie and I recommend it for anyone who is a fan of either of these great performers.,1264896000,,245,4.083333333333333
1009486,4,6305326665,"Minimalist film in which the beloved Bjorg makes a poignant portrait of an introspective girl with serious affective , emotional and visual problems which visibly affect her relationship with the outer world.

Eventually she will be unfairly accused ; the things will get worst to her and eventually she will be executed for death.

A great homage of the cinema for itself.

Impressive film of Lars von Triers.",1107820800,,410,5.0
1009487,2,6305326665,"Trite made-for-TV movie with Victoria Principal as a woman trying to be a perfect housewife.  After her father-in-law tires to rape her, her husband begins to question the mental state of his wife.  With the help of his father he finds a doctor willing to medicate her into submission and into a mental hospital.  Only after some horrific experiences does he being to realize the truth of what he has done to the woman he loves.
As TV movies go this was below average. The plot was choppy and slow moving.  And their contempt for the mental health system is so obvious you have to think the screenwriter was trying to get back as his shrink does.  If this really based on a true story then there should have been some epilogue to cover what happened to the snake pit the lead was condemned to.",1042329600,12,793,4.441379310344828

1009816,4,6305326665,"This movie seems dated and technically mediocre, but the themes are strongly and reallistically portrayed. Yes, there are men who try to rape their daughters-in-law physycally and/or psychologically. Yes, a mental institution can be that bad and hurtful. Yes, husbands sometimes stick up for their fathers instead of believing and protecting their wives. Yes, innocent and immature wives who believe in fairy tales can have a hard time growing up, especially when they are emotionally abused. Yes, there is hope for change. Yes, it can be much harder than it seems.",1430179200,,565,5.21978021978022
1009817,3,6305326665,"It was attempted rape, not rape as stated in the movie description.  Victoria Principal did a poor acting job as a southern belle.  Her accent was all over the place.  My favorite genre is non-fiction, but some of the ways in which this story was portrayed made it hard to believe.  Like how scary they tried to make the mental hospital look; it just seemed over the top with their spooky shadows and such.  It was an 'okay' movie.",1428796800,4,431,4.405063291139241
1009818,5,6305326665,I don't know how anyone could not like this movie... I like a lot of Lifetime movies but this one is in my top 5 favorites... Victoria Principal plays Anne Forbes better than she ever played Pam Ewing on Dallas... And Robert Vaughn gives an awesome portrayal as her evil father-in-law who tries to rape her is outstanding! By the end of the movie I was ready to scratch his eyes out! lol,1420243200,5,387,4.315068493150685

1009821,5,6305326665,"This is a beautiful film that exposes the most sensitive family secrets in a realistic way. It conjures healing between a husband who can't face up to the truth about his alcoholic lecherous father and his wife whom the father tried to rape. When the family members collude the wife is involuntarily committed to a psych ward in which she is further abused by sadistic nurses and doctors. Given overdoses of psychotropics this brilliant loving dancer is reduced to a slobbering addict. When the climax occurs all is nearly lost and that's when the realism of the therapeutic process begins. If you've ever experienced any of these problems within a family system than this movie will remind you that competent professionals and the willingness to listen and open up to the people you love will prompt resolution, forgiveness, and change. It's all possible and that's what this important plot, the film's strongest quality, clarifies.",1415923200,,933,5.064935064935065

1009896,5,6305326665,"Being a recreation of an actual event made the movie spark my interest. When you follow the whole story to the end it is unimaginable that people do what they do.  It does not surprise me what strangers will do for money; however, when someone in the family or extended family goes over the boundaries of good morals to those who are suppose to look up to them as an example; this is unforgivable. I'd say more however, people should not spoil the movie for others in their comments.  Victoria puts on one of her best performances in this movie; better than Dallas even.",1401494400,,570,4.471153846153846
1009897,5,6305326665,"This made for TV movie was excellent. I liked how Victoria Principal's character stood up for herself in the end that sent a message to all women, that have been abused, whether by a person or within the system, in some fashion.  I will give the movie five starts. Highly recommend.

However, the streaming was not that hot, that was rather annoying.",1399334400,,350,4.629032258064516
1009898,5,6305326665,I have seen this movie many times.  Victoria Principal does a nice job at tugging at your emotions.  Only after going through absolute h e l l does her character finally stick up for herself and get her life back together.,1394236800,,222,4.390243902439025
1009899,4,6305326665,Any movie with Victoria Principal is great. I still really like her in Dallas but she is great in this too,1390176000,,106,4.095238095238095
1009900,1,6305326665,"This is a classic example of WHY YOU DON'T TURN YOUR LIFE OVER TO ANYONE--INCLUDING YOUR SPOUSE.  She helped him commit her by being a weakling.  The first thing she should have done after the father-in-law attacked her in the sauna was to confront him in front of everyone, that way it's out in the open.  Heck, I did this when I was molested by own father at 12 and this 30 or 40 year old woman couldn't?

The second thing she should have done was to divorce her crazy, weak husband if he had not already decided to cut his sick father off; but to let herself be overtaken by this so called husband and that equally crazy doctor, is in and of itself insane.

This movie has the potential to really make you fighting mad.  I stuck around just to see where it ended, but before it was over, there were a lot of faces I wanted to slap hard.",1384992000,,839,4.148148148148148
1009901,1,6305326665,I was excited to rent this movie and thoughthe story sounded interesting but the moving is way too boring I felt asleep watching it.,1383782400,,132,4.541666666666667
1009902,4,6305326665,Wow I can't believe this movie was inspired by actual events. I mean what's a woman to do when her father in law tries to rape her and no one believes her? Then to top it off she is sent to a mental institution? How can she get out while they drug her against her will? Well if you watch this movie those questions will be answered. Sad story but a good one to watch.,1380153600,,367,3.9066666666666667
1009903,4,6305326665,"It's both sad and scary that such things can happen in an almost 'natural' progression of events. One thing led to another and by the time you know it, things have gotten out of hand.
Although the husband was at fault, I am glad that he stood by his wife all that time and eventually came round to face the truth.",1379203200,,313,4.147540983606557
7887647,1,6305326665,"Terrible acting, terrible script. Obviously I saw a different film than most responses.",1504569600,,87,5.769230769230769
7887648,1,6305326665,"I struggled to get through to the end of this movie. I couldn't decide whether the husband or the wife was more ignorant. The husband refuses to see that his father tried to rape his wife & that his father has disregard for all women. The husband believes every word his father says & not one from his wife--all in vain. Couldn't the son/husband see the real man his drunken father was or just didn't want to see it? It's difficult to NOT see the drunken father over-the-top with the booze. Accepted by the son & wife while guilty of affairs that the wife would refuse to believe. Mother and son lived a shallow world of denial. None of this movie was appealing or believable, nor the acting convincing. Don't spend precious time watching this movie.",1493251200,,750,4.522058823529412
