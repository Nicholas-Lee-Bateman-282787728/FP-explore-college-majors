5301250,5,B009AMAKBI,"With The Paperboy, we have the arrival of a major new cinematic talent - Lee Daniels. Though his first two films (the bizarre Shadowboxer and the extremely well-acted Precious) had their merits, only with The Paperboy do we finally see the maturation of his craft, the arrival of a distinct new voice. It is a hypnotically bold, daringly original, and utterly fearless film that seemingly effortlessly dances between drama and comedy, tenderness and tension, completely unafraid to go to shocking, dangerous places. It feels totally unpredictable, and nothing about it feels safe, which is something far too many movies are these days. The Paperboy hearkens back to the audacious spirit of American cinema in the 1970s, when filmmakers weren't afraid to make outrageous works like Deliverance and Prime Cut. In this film's world, nothing is sacred, and because Daniels is so assured with this approach, so completely in control of every moment, watching it is an enthralling, absorbing, exhilarating experience.

Rarely am I so entertained and captivated by a film, and even more rarely am I so blown away by a film's originality and daring. With The Paperboy, Lee Daniels created a world I didn't want to leave and a film I didn't want to end. I can't wait to see where he goes from here.",1355875200,66,1289,4.967592592592593
5301251,5,B009AMAKBI,"I came to this film not knowing what to expect. I hadn't seen ""Precious"" so I was unfamiliar with Lee Daniel's work. Plus, I had read some of the negative reviews about the film, so I came to the film with some trepdidation. But from the opening sequence in which Macy Gray barges in on Zac Efron to clean up his room, and the hilarious dialogue between these two actors, I was hooked. Nothing about what I had heard about the film had anything to do with the actual film. It was at times sad, funny, bizaare, chilling, grotesque, romantic, menacing, and at times all of the above. It was like nothing I have ever seen, except perhaps for the films of Tod Soldendz.

This film, like so many great films, doesn't have a genre, so if the fact that it doesn't fit into some preconceived notion of a specific type of film upsets you, you are not going to understand this film. It is mostly a character study of all the motives, predjudices, obsessions, and secrets that each character in the film carries around with them. Each of the actors is outstanding, and it is a tribute to Lee Daniels that he was able to get such great performances from these actors in roles that had to be extremely challenging for them.

I predict that in time, this film will come to be viewed as the masterpiece that it is.",1355011200,107,1299,4.385892116182573
5301252,5,B009AMAKBI,"This motion picture is difficult to watch in places; but it is without doubt one of the best films I've seen this year. Nicole Kidman's performance deserves an Oscar. Ms Kidman is truly an actress who cannot be forced into cookie cutter roles. She has proven throughout her career that she can assume the character convincingly no matter how different that individual is from herself ... a rare and amazing gift.

Matthew McConaughey, Zac Efron, David Oyelowo, John Cusack & Macy Gray also give outstanding performances. I especially loved the character played by Macy Gray ... a truly loving and generous character in the midst of a world that did not value her as she deserved.

The Paperboy touches many dark places known to human beings. The film is set in a small Florida town in 1969 ... a place you might expect to find the racism and violence depicted in the film; but by the end of the film, you may view these expected vices tame compared to the other human conditions you'll witness. The Paperboy brings to the surface so much more than you'd ever expect to find in that damp, dark, swampy place.

You won't forget this film for a long time. It will haunt you for days.",1352073600,67,1180,4.5829383886255926
5301253,2,B009AMAKBI,"What happens when a reporter goes back to his hometown to look into an old crime for which a convicted murderer is already on death row? Expect a sweaty, repugnant, suspenseful thriller that features rape, sex, slogging through a swamp, raunchy dialog, rough trade in the gay world, alligator guts being ripped out and fed to the pigs, and a throat being cut. Plus... Not quite so traumatizing... LOTS of scenes with a nicely buffed Zac Efron in his whitey tighties.

Watch:
  * Nichole Kidman (""Rabbit Hole"") sporting an authentic Southern drawl, is Charlotte, the local slut who is attracted to prison pen pals.
  * John Cusack (""The Raven"") is Hillary Van Wetter, the convicted killer, a vile disgusting excuse for humanity, but open to share Charlotte's charms.
  * Matthew McConaughey (""Killer Joe"") is Ward Jansen, the journalist who has come ""home"" to look into a possible miscarriage of justice.
  * Zac Efron (""The Lucky One"") is Jack, the hormonally charged young man who mostly watches the sordid scene unfold.
  * David Oyelowo (""The Help"") is Yardley Acheman, a journalist who prizes being published over being truthful. Plus, it's very hard for a black English citizen to stomach the social attitudes of the late '60s American South.
  * Macy Gray (""For Colored Girls"") is Anita, the housemaid who narrates the story.

This R-rated raunch-fest features waaay too much nudity, sex, violence, and profanity. This is exactly the sort of film I avoid and I want to warn you in advance. There is absolutely NO one to root for and the dialog is deucedly difficult to discern.

Writer Peter Dexter (""Mulholland Falls"") is more repulsive than usual and producer/director Lee Daniels (""Precious"") doesn't pull any punches. By the way, urine IS a recommended emergency treatment for jelly fish stings.

I LOATHED this one, but it will be available on Amazon.com if you like this sort of thing...",1351814400,16,1899,4.962025316455696
5301254,3,B009AMAKBI,"Ask just about anyone about ""The Paperboy"" and they'll reply with something along the lines of, ""Isn't that that movie where Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron?"" It's funny because that seemed to be the only thing anyone knew about the film going into it. What's peculiar about ""The Paperboy"" is that it's difficult to pinpoint just what type of genre it is. There are comedic elements in there, it's very dramatic at times and really thrilling at others, and the ending is incredibly dark and unexpected. Unfortunately the film doesn't always hit its mark. In fact, it doesn't even hit the target at all at times.

Just about every character introduced in the film is sex hungry. Add that to the white trash atmosphere and humor and it's a little overwhelming. Some will find it hysterical, but it's incredibly cheesy more often than not. Whether it's Jack complaining that his dad's maid Anita (Macy Gray) didn't knock before entering his room because he may have been jerking off, Jack and Yardley's obsession with having sex with Charlotte, or Anita's trashy voiceover that guides you through the events of the film that comes off more obnoxious than amusing, the film is constantly jumping all over the place except when it comes to its humor or sexual devotion.

Things begin to get really ludicrous once everyone starts visiting the prison to see Hillary. Charlotte claims to get horny in Jack's car because of ""good vibrations"" while their first meeting with Hillary is just absolutely preposterous; Charlotte and Hillary basically orgasm without ever touching each other. It seems like the film wastes so much time with kinky scenes and silly dialogue.

Some of the performances are really impressive though. Matthew McConaughey continues the dark streak he started with ""Killer Joe"" here as Ward has this demented side to him that's pretty shocking. He has this scene in his apartment where he's too drunk to function properly and is yelling memories of their mother to Zac Efron from the shower that's both haunting and kind of depressing. David Oyelowo also puts in a strong performance. Yardley's true motives make him an absolutely despicable character and Oyelowo does an impeccable job bringing those characteristics to life. Many of the characters seem to have this different side to them that they hide from the rest of the world; everyone except Hillary Van Wetter. He's not only as messed up as everyone thinks, but even more deranged than anyone can imagine. It's one of the most unusual roles John Cusack has ever portrayed.

The way the film is edited is incredibly distracting. Shots are constantly bleeding into others while many scenes begin out of focus and jump around the room before finally settling on the scene at hand. The first few times this is done, it seems like an artistic endeavor. But once you realize that's the way the entire film is edited, it feels amateurish at best and its execution absolutely takes away from whatever the film did have to offer.

The screenplay comes off like it's purposely trying to be awful and the film's inability to pick a genre and stick with it seems to hurt it more often than not. At the same time though, the majority of the performances are very strong and everything is certainly unpredictable. The humor is where the film may lose you though. Whether you're a fan of white trash humor that you'd probably find on any episode of ""Jerry Springer"" is what will swerve your opinion one way or the other. ""The Paperboy"" is constantly playing chicken with the line that divides a good movie from a bad one. Just when you've written it off, it reels you back in. Ridiculous through and through and absolutely jaw dropping at times, if ""The Paperboy"" is one thing it's a compelling piece of cinema.",1350086400,8,3767,4.834108527131783
5301255,4,B009AMAKBI,"Let me state upfront that I had seen the movie trailer for this, and that I was really looking forward to seeing it. The movie trailer made it sound like this was going to be a Florida sun-baked crime thriller not unlike, say, ""Body Heat"" from the early 80s. And the of course there was going to be the already heavily buzzed about performance of Nicole Kidman! The movie opened recently, and I saw it at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington in a solidly packed (but not sold out) theatre.

""The Paperboy"" (2012 release; 101 min.) brngs the parallel story, set in Florida 1969, of how Charlotte, played by Nicole Kidman, strikes up a penpal friendship with an inmate, convicted murderer Hillary Van Wetter (played by John Cuseck), and how two reporters from the Miami Times, Ward (played by Matthew McConaughey) and Yardley (played by David Oyelowo), come up from Miami to do their own investigation whether Hillary is really guilty of murder or whether he was framed. The other major role in the movie is for Ward's little brother Jack (played by Zac Efron), who is the gofer for the reporters. Given the type of movie this is, to give away more of the plot would ruind your viewing experience, so you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, yes this is a crime thriller of sorts, but the movie was never able to captivate me completely (and in that sense, this ain't no ""Body Heat""). Plus there were several sidebars that really had nothing to do with advancing the plot and were unnecessary in my view (the ""gay S&M"" scene comes to mind, among others). So you can say that the movie ultimately was a disappointment for me. But it wasn't a complete waste of my time either, on account of Nicole Kidman's amazing, barn-burning performance as the wild and crazy Charlotte. Kidman brings the performance without holding back. She is sly, funny, shocking, vulnerable. But wait, there is more! If you think you've seen it all, you will be floored as well by the performance from John Cusack, whose Hillary character is so deranged and sick, it is hard to believe this is the same actor who brought us the oh-so-likeable Lloyd character in ""Say Anything"". Also a quick note that Matthew McConaughey brings another interesting off-center performance as Ward, but to see him at the top of his game, I'd urge you to check him out in the recent ""Killer Joe"" movie. The movie audience I saw this with in the theatre seemed similarly perplexed and non-plussed as I was. Bottom line: you'll likely come for the movie plot but you'll stay for the gutty acting performances.",1350086400,9,2608,4.667391304347826

This movie was incredibly under-rated, but thankfully I found it!!
Indescribably complex, riveting, SHOCK-THRILL, and the entire cast completely blew me away. The Paperboy is like nothing I've ever seen, as each actor defines what STRETCHING ONE'S CRAFT actually means.
Macy Gray shows the entire WORLD that she can hang-tough with all these extremely seasoned actors, which was something I'd never fathomed she even held an interest for.

I came across it whilst I was looking for Zac Efron movies.  After reading what I was about, I was intrigued to see it.  Not to mention the fact that it has an all star cast - it had to be good right?  Well it certainly was in my opinion.  I found all of the stars did outstanding in the movie.  I have to say, I think John Cusack's performance was incredible.  Many things came to light during the movie that I found quite surprising.

And, this movies turned me on to Zac Efron. Honestly, if we were not such a homophobic nation, I believe that this film would have been nominated for all kinds of awards. Lee Daniels does lay it on thick. But, with this type of movie, you almost have to. The characters are believable, as if this was an adaptation of a book written about a factual account of this murder. But, to my knowledge, this is just something that originated from Daniels' mind. And, what an origination it is. I won't go into details about the movie. Just google it and read the synopsis. And, then mosey on over to whatever outlet you purchase your films from and snap this one up. I was able to watch it, a few years ago, for .99 cents on Amazon.

This is not a film for the squeamish, the short-attention-spaners, or the moral high-road walkers who are offended by art brutally and clearly depicting the moral low road and its corrupting effect. This film was no fun, but I found it to be art on an exalted level rarely seen on the ""big screen"" these days.

He has such a presence on screen and a tenderness that resonates even when he's angry or fighting.  And you see him in his underwear a lot which will make a lot of people happy!  I just didn't connect though with the movie.  At the end of it I was wiped out and really didn't know what to feel or think, if anything.

I didn't care about a single character.  They were all self-centered and focused on their needs.  The compassion and empathy that a character has to project is what draws the audience to them.

5302191,2,B009AMAKBI,"This is a hard one watch and I saw very few good moments. Mostly I wondered how so many talented actors had been enticed into making this film.  The director tries to say so many things at once without ever really gaining a foothold on his point. Yes, bigotry and intolerance were the mentality of the day, but surely there were a few decent, kind people in the South in the 1960s. Less, than few, according to this film and it fails to say anything new. The only likable characters are Jack (Zac Efron) and Anita (Macy Gray) and despite his good performance (some of the best moments are between Efron and Gray) the director failed to notice that what little southern accent Efron had, seemed to come and go, and sometimes the rest of the cast sounded like they were performing a parody of a Tennessee William's play. Mostly I came away repulsed and depressed by gratuitous violence and abusive sex and wondering what I could do to get the two hours of my life back.  And by the way, that scene in the prison where Kidman tears her pantyhose..... newsflash Mr. Daniel's....most of us were still wearing garter belts and stockings then.",1405209600,,1136,4.563725490196078

This film just didn't inspire the same emotions as movies like ""Dead Man Walking"" or ""The Green Mile""...it was more on par with ""The Chamber"".  But I will give a big hand to John Qusack, who practically disappeared into his role of redneck Hillary Van Wetter (Hillary?)  As for the leads, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron definitely displayed a camaraderie with one another, but it still felt like one that had been constructed for the film.  It just didn't feel natural at times.  David Oyelowo was all over the place, but given who he played, that is perhaps a good thing.  Nicole Kidman was absolutely convincing as a woman determined to get her man off Death Row by any means necessary.  Overall, it's not a bad film and the twists are decent.  Among crime thrillers, it holds up quite nicely.  Enjoy.",1404259200,,947,4.684848484848485

5302241,4,B009AMAKBI,"Matthew McConaughey, John Cusack, almost unrecognizable, and Nicole Kidman,  in a role so opposite Virginia Wolfe in The Hours; these are truly amazing actors.  The superb range of these 3 made up for a rather meaningless plot, that of getting re-tried/exonerated a perhaps not guilty swine of a man charged w/ murder, but incompetently defended.  The bizarre twists into human character, and the setting, in part the swamps of"" Deliverance"" type S. Florida made the movie, for me at least, unforgettable; jolting. The exploration of details of the case made for a good mystery; I watched it twice, then a third time.  I can't say this flic is for everyone; but if you're a fan of any of the 3 above mentioned actors, and interested in watching a pretty graphically shocking movie, and a decent mystery, this one would be right up your alley.

I've read the book, and of course it delves much more deeply into the characters' history; a picture may be worth a thousand words, but the right words are hard to put on film, sometime impossible; but the movie did a good job of the slight alterations it did make.  You won't be bored, that I guarantee.  If it hooks you, read the book.  I'm checking  Pete Dexter (author) out further.

Def recommend for the broadminded (no pun), and introspective.  This is no Disney flic.

ps...there are some odd aspects, such as the narration, the 3-in-one screen shots, that rather detract from the  cohesiveness of the story, could easily have done w/out. JMO.",1400457600,,1495,4.770428015564202

I can't count the times I had to rewind to see what was going on. It could have been so much better. The superstars, Nicole Kidnman and Matthew McConaughey are jewels in this piece but the movie is really about Zac Efron and literally Macy Gray's story and they are so good in this flick and Cusack is frighteningly disturbing.

5302246,2,B009AMAKBI,"I bought this film primarily to see if Zac Efron could hold his own in such a stellar company. He can and he did. And I was really enjoying the twists and turns of the plot, which (like Dr. Johnson's horse) ""ran off in all directions at once."" But while the director may be astute in encouraging interesting performances out of actors of differing levels of experience, he clearly has little interest in the fine art of resolving a plot. After the film narrows down to a deadly confrontation between the hero and the villain, what should have been a hair-raising suspenseful DELIVERANCE-style final showdown was simply ""skipped over"" as it might have been in a Road-Runner cartoon. One moment, our hero (menaced by a deadly psychopath) is alone and unarmed swimming in a Florida swamp; the next moment, he's in a motorboat speeding off to safety!  There are classic instances in which directors have simply run out of the time or money needed to finish their films as they wanted; but the Special Features on this DVD spend so much time lauding Mr. Daniel's  ""genius"" in working with actors that I doubt this was the case with THE PAPER BOY. I suspect that the director simply lost interest in the plot once all of the often-surprising character points had been revealed. Bottom line: With a more satisfying denouement, this could have been VERY good film.",1397779200,2,1356,4.741525423728813

I quite happily partake of the likes of Elmore Leonard, and can be convinced to pay homage at the shrine of gothic noir, but this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

She's a high speed train of sexuality that you know is going to crash and when it happens you've already learned to dislike her and feel sorry for her and yet, it tears you up when she crashes. The other performances are also strong and Cusack is particularly creepy and unlikeable.

I will never be able to watch another John Cusack film and not be haunted by his depiction of the Hillary character. I am too traumatized to ever watch ""Say Anything"" ever again.

5302484,4,B009AMAKBI,"The basic plot is that Ward Jansen (played by Matthew McConaughey), a newspaper reporter from Miami, comes back to his hometown to prove who really killed Sheriff Thurmond Call because he does not believe that Hillary van Wetter, the social outcast who was convicted of the murder and is soon to be executed, killed Sheriff Call.  Van Wetter's fianc&eacute;e, Charlotte Bless (played by Nicole Kidman) has had a role in convincing Ward that van Wetter is innocent.

The Jansen family maid, Anita Chester (played by Macy Gray) narrates the movie at some time in the future.  It is not clear to whom she is telling the story or why except she does ask how much money she will be paid.

The movie centers around relationships -- Macy Gray and Zac Efron; Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman; Zac Efron and Matthew McConaughey; and Nicole Kidman and John Cusack.

Nicole Kidman and John Cusack give amazing performances.

In the beginning I did not recognize Nicole Kidman -- she had me convinced she was a poor white woman from Florida who wrote letters to convicts and was convinced that Hillary van Wetter (played by John Cusack) should not be on death row for allegedly killing Sheriff Call.

I also did not recognize John Cusack at first -- he had me convinced he was a crude, violent, poor white man from Florida who lived in the swamp and hunted and gutted alligators.

Zac Efron's performance was also worthy and the anchor of the movie.

Macy Gray's performance is worthy of a professional seasoned actress.

Who exactly killed Sheriff Call is never settled.",1375315200,,1554,4.764925373134329

I frankly think that all four of them are capable of making better movies than this crap.  The storyline is strange and it's scary to think that there are women in the world as stupid as Nicole Kidman's character.  Zac Efron winds up being the hero (believe it or not) and the last five minutes of the movie are the most suspenseful.  But the scene in the prison when Nicole's character meets John's character is simply disgusting.  There were a few parts that I didn't grimace through, but overall this movie sucks.",1375228800,,664,4.53781512605042
5302486,2,B009AMAKBI,"With Hollywood A-list actors including Nicole Kidman and Matthew McConaughey, ""The Paperboy"" wants to shock us so much. Perhaps you have already heard about Kidman's character urinating on someone else. But what is really shocking is that for all the highly stylized acting and direction from Lee Daniels, ""The Paperboy"" is not really fascinating. This overcooked potboiler is curiously boring, feeling emotionally remote.

Set in 1969, Florida, the film follows the story of ""the paperboy"" Jack Jansen (Zac Efron) recently kicked out of college. While Jack helps his brother and the Miami Times reporter Ward (McConaughey) researching and writing about a death-row inmate Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) convicted for the murder of a local sheriff, Jack is attracted to a Southern woman Charlotte Bless (Kidman), who has been corresponding with Van Wetter.

Now, my synopsis may make ""The Paperboy"" sound like a standard Southern noir, which the film is simply not. In fact, it is hard to describe what the film is all about, and this is not a compliment. It is a hot and steamy melodrama where no one really cares what is going on around them, so why should we? It is not that the film is all about shock value; it is rather that we are underwhelmed by the film's obvious attempt to impress us with over-the-top acting and the showy camerawork.

Obviously the film has so many things to say, but with these larger than life characters vying for attention, I am not really sure we should take this ""thriller"" or whatever it is seriously.",1374883200,2,1539,4.911538461538462

Excellent performances all round,
Unpredictable turns.
OK, it is a little raw in a few places. that didn't bother me but you may not want to pay real close attention in a couple of spots. There are a few scenes that will stick with you because the performances are so brilliant.

5302553,2,B009AMAKBI,"I watch over 200 movies per year and had placed this movie in my Netflix queue based on the cast alone.  I was unfamiliar with the story.  While this movie could have been a great film, it ultimately fails based on the over-reaching direction.  Lee Daniels aggressively tackles some very sensitive subjects and I like the fact that he is unafraid.  However, for a story to flow you can't just drop in on a few fascinating scenes.  The movie felt forced and the attempt to address too many ""lessons"" was what ultimately made the movie feel too contrived.

The story-line of a gay newspaper reporter, Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughy) who attempts to expose small town corruption in the wrongful conviction of a presumably innocent (although heinous monster) Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) who is more interested in his death-row groupie, Charlotte (Nicole Kidman).  Ward's younger brother, Jack (Zac Efron) becomes obsessed with the obsessed Charlotte.  Efron delivers a surprisingly touching and believable character.  Kidman also delivers a fabulous performance.

The movie was hard to follow.  It seems a real shame that these actors delivered some great performances and the final cut feels patched together to force a point.  I am anxious to see how Daniel's new movie fares, which is currently receiving so much buzz.",1372982400,,1323,5.102325581395349

5302559,4,B009AMAKBI,"After hanging on for a tad over 90 minutes, I was just shaking my head trying to understand if I actually liked this movie or am I some kind of misanthropic voyeur.  Surprisingly, a fine cast of A-Listers pull no punches in this steamy portrayal of redneck racism, sex and violence.

Set in swampy Florida of the 1960's, a well renowned Miami newspaper reporter returns to the small town where he grew up to look into the case against a convicted killer sitting on death row.  Ward (Matthew McConaughey) is the son of the local newspaper publisher (Scott Glenn) and brother of Jack (Zac Efron).  Accompanying Ward is a black-but-British-so-it's-OK writing partner (David Oyelowo).  One of the conflicts in Hillary Van Wetter's (John Cusack) conviction is that a cousin did not testify that Hillary was with him stealing sod from the golf course when the murder was committed.

In the mix is a sordid woman (Nicole Kidman) who wants to have celebrity sex with Hillary.  The only way Hillary will talk to the newspaper men is if they bring Charlotte (Kidman) to prison with them.  Prison rules forbid any touching.  In their first meeting, Charlotte as instructed by Hillary, spreads her legs and opens her mouth while Hillary...well, you get the picture.  All while Ward and Yardley look on.  Jack, who acts as a driver for the crew has a big time crush on Charlotte... and yes they do.

Directed by Lee Daniels (""Precious""), this isn't a pretty picture.  It is full of unlikable people who do unlikeable things, but damn if I wasn't a bit locked in.  The film is twisted, trashy but has just enough film-noir style for me to like it.",1371600000,4,1633,4.704225352112676

5302664,3,B009AMAKBI,"I recommend this movie almost entirely because of Nicole Kidman's performance. She is one of the few actors whose acting is art. She has matured as an actor in the past decade and manages to be engaging and fresh in each film she is in lately, and this film is no exception. Otherwise, this movie is a confused mixture of melodrama, coming of age and noir plot elements. It is at its best when exposing the sexual peculiarities and personality flaws of the main characters, and learning how sick they are kept me wanting to see where they were all going to end up, whether or not this is cheap on the part of the filmmakers. There is a mystery driving the plot, and the way it is resolved (no spoilers) is fit only for a much smarter movie. This is a silly movie with a funhouse cast of characters, and it should have delivered with a semi-expected pay-off in the end. The Paperboy is entertaining if you do not walk in expecting it to be a great movie, but the tonal shift towards the end when the movie takes itself too seriously almost ruins the experience. Kidman redeems it.",1370131200,,1079,4.4

The cast was stellar without any doubt,  but I found the story and the movie very disturbing and beyond violent and vulgar and way too  graphic. It was not my kind of entertainment.  The movie belonged to Zachary Efron and Macy Gray as their performances were 5 star. Nicole Kidman was superb and one of my favorite actresses which was one of the reasons I bought it.  I was disappointed the story was so disturbing.

5302666,1,B009AMAKBI,"This plot, acting, and dialogue was so bad that I spent more time laughing than caring.  It can be fun to laugh at a bad movie, but in this case, after laughing for a while, I felt sorry for the effort the actors and film makers wasted.  It seems to me that you have to care about at least one person in a story to value the yarn.....this writer must not have known that.  It is obvious that we are supposed to care about the young college dropout (actually expelled), but why should we?  He falls for a trashy woman.  He uses the ""N"" word. He has no purpose in life except to get his trashy blond away from her convict boyfriend and the rest of her ""anybody, anytime"" lovers.  The story teller tells us that this extremely handsome boy and college swimming star never had a real girlfriend until he fell for his trashy piece of fluff.  Give me a break. This boy would have had dozens of girlfriends in high school and college, and believability still counts for something, doesn't it? I kept watching because I thought the plot would have some great twists and turns that make up a good mystery.  I was wrong.  Actually, the first half of the movie was not too bad, mainly because I kept thinking, ""Oh, boy, they are setting up for a really great mystery plot that could surprise us at every turn"", but the middle moves so slowly that I started fast-forwarding occasionally toward the end, and there were no surprises. It's like they let a good writer begin the story and then turned it over to an unimaginative hack to finish it.  Also the sound was terrible, with people muttering half the time, echoes, and whispers that I only was able to understand about half of the dialogue...not that the movie would have been any better if one could understand every word.  What could have saved this waste of time was a better plot.  Already boring and dull, they film makers stretched it out to an hour and forty-five minutes to make it more boring and dull.  I bet the theater owners sold a lot of popcorn.  When anything is this tiresome, there is not much else to do except head for the lobby and hang out at the video machines with your popcorn and drink.

5302693,3,B009AMAKBI,"I watched this movie on Netflix fully prepared for it to go either way. It had an interesting trailer that promised a Deep South crime thriller, as well as an A-list cast. I had also read and enjoyed, Paris Trout by Pete Dexter, who wrote the novel this film is based on as well as its screenplay. On the other hand, this film has almost universally negative reviews from critics and viewers. I would chalk those up to bait-&-switch advertising. The trailer and plot summary try to sell this film as a crime thriller/mystery, but it's really a much darker, character driven, Southern-Gothic drama about the intersection of a handful of severely messed up people one Florida summer. The crime & mystery elements (which we're never made to care too much for in the first place) are quickly put on the back burner and eventually forgotten as the interaction between the four lead actors (all of whom break type wonderfully in this film) takes center stage: Kidman's trashy femme fatale (of sorts), Efron's bored and sexually frustrated paperboy, *spoiler* McConaughey's self-loathing homosexual with a death-wish *end spoiler*, and Cusack's psychotic convict. The acting is phenomenal and the story is basically nonexistent, which is not necessarily a bad thing because it gives these wildly fascinating characters lots of space to roam.

5302697,5,B009AMAKBI,"My experience of this film was as if I were reading a novel late at night rather than watching a movie on my computer.  It presented all the characters unspoken thoughts, easily perceived if you relaxed your peripheral vision enough to view and decode the camera and editing work that expressed them.

The acting, for me, was riveting. From the leads to incidental characters, all were helpless puppets to destinies unconsciously pulled from their hands long before we ever met them. The freshly brilliant Nichole Kidman appeared barely older than she was in her 1995 performance in ""To Die For""...but more twisted and lush for age . I didn't recognize John Cusack at first.  As an actor, he never once interfered  with the sad and scary stranger he portrayed. Zac Efron's compelling complexity  was a surprise to me.

I was sold from the first scene in which Macy Gray's character riffed off memories of a long ago crime with an authenticity and weirdness that only Grey could produce without effort.  She set a mildly alien tone that followed throughout the whole story. The music, some of which she performed off camera, gave a sparkling frame to the chaos of an otherwise dark narrative.

The movie wove the unexpected authenticity of ""Adaptation"" with the deliberately poor taste and graphic violence of ""Pulp Fiction,"" and sharpened it uncomfortably with the unbearable atmosphere of untethered slaughter found in ""Schindler's List.' The story stood strong as lurid, adult True Crime removed from current news only by its raunchy technicolor, its sometimes seemingly pointless cinematography and its shocking (or even unrecognizable to the uninitiated) sexuality. All that alone could satisfy even if you didn't get cut bt (or even 'get') the story's razor sharp nails protruding everywhere on this fast, Southern water slide into artfully numbing despair.",1368230400,,1862,5.142384105960265

THE PAPERBOY does have two major redeeming virtues:

1. Maid Anita Chester (Macy Gray)'s narration, character, and interactions with Zac Efron (Jack Jansen);

2. The big ironic twist at the end after a patchy, meandering storyline.

The blurbs on the DVD box rave about what an outrageously different film this is, but I simply don't see what they mean. It's just another ""noir"" piece that seems to be satirizing something--I'm not sure what. Often funny in a dark, gross way, but usually more of a guffaw than lol sort of humor.

Bare in mind this film is not for everyone.  It is dark, gritty and at times just plain nasty. It is a film that will make some of you uncomfortable. Be warned if you find Lisa Lampanelli too offensive you might want to pass on this one.

The story takes place during a 1969 sultry summer in a small Florida town. Ward (Matthew McConaughey) a newspaper writer comes back home with his co-writer Yardley (David Oyelowoto) to expose what he thinks is the wrongful conviction of Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) who is on death role for the murder of the local sheriff. Nicole Kidman plays Hillary's love interest Charlotte and completes the trio who try to get Hillary released. Kidman's performance is brilliant and Oscar should have been mentioned.  Ward's younger brother Jack (Zac Efron) does an equally good job. Primarily lusting after the sexy Charlotte who is not at all interested.

A real pleasant treat is Macy Gray as Anita, the maid and Jack's friend/surrogate mother.  Tennessee Williams this ain't. Other than it's in the South, it's sweaty and a whole lot of people have more issues than `Sports Illustrated'.  A well-acted movie with a somewhat choppy storyline but then again it's not a documentary.  You should be smart enough to fill in the holes with your own ideas.  If not maybe you need to stick to 'Madea' movies.

5302865,1,B009AMAKBI,"Lee Daniels has made two films prior to this; SHADOWBOXER with Stephen Dorff (which I have not seen) and the fine PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS garnered a number of awards for the cast and an Independent Spirit award for Daniels as director. With such a strong sophomore effort, he was able to assemble the likes of Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey, John Cusack and David Oyelowo as well as the questionable acting talents of Zac Efron and Macy Gray (?) for the Southern Gothic-style mystery/drama THE PAPERBOY. The film had gained controversy early on in its reviews about a scene where Kidman's character has to urinate on Efron's character after being stung by jellyfish.

The reviews also failed to mention that the film also tends to relieve itself on the audience, resulting in a disgusting, smelly mess of narrative, hopelessly deficient storytelling and some of these actors' worst performances to date.

THE PAPERBOY takes place in the late 1960's in rural Florida. A racist sheriff is killed, and imprisoned and to be executed for the crime is Hillary Van Wetter (Cusack), a volatile backwater scumbag. Crusading reporters Wade (McConaughey) and Yardley (Oyelowo) visit Wade's hometown where his father (Scott Glenn), his younger brother Jack (Efron) and father's maid Anita (Gray) live to open their own investigation into the murderer to hopefully get Hillary acquitted for a crime he seems to be wrongly convicted of. Along for the ride is the seemingly professional and hyper-sexual prisoner pen-pal Charlotte (Kidman), who professes her love for Hillary in a series of letters. This leads to all sorts of discomfort as Jack falls madly in love with Charlotte, despite her engagement to Hillary, and how she also may have slept with Yardley (who has secrets of his own) to help produce false information that may lead to Hillary's exoneration. This leads Ward and Jack to confront certain truths of their own and to an inevitable confrontation with Hillary in his swamp home.

As I was watching this film, I kept telling myself, ""This HAS to get better soon"". With Kidman's 60's spray-tan and wigs and Cusack's absurd hair and accent and just the absolute contempt this film seems to have for its characters (and the audience, apparently), it is almost entirely unwatchable. I don't mind films filled with unlikable characters; I happen to think that William Friedkin's KILLER JOE (a BRILLIANT southern-fried noir, also starring McConaughey) was a work of genius and it's populated by people you wouldn't urinate on if their heads were on fire. But with that film, it seemed that Friedkin seemed to have some affection for those characters, and here with THE PAPERBOY, it seems like Daniels is actively trying to get you to hate all of these characters. Aside from Jack and Wade and Anita, all of the other characters are just detestable, and instead of just allowing you to make your own judgments, Daniels shoves it down your throat just how awful these human beings are. His directorial style makes no sense whatsoever other than to serve as a pretentious psuedo-throwback to 60's and 70's era filmmaking (split-screens, composite visuals, forced juxtaposition), and it just serves to throw this film deeper into unwatchability.

And these actors give, collectively, some of the worst performances of their careers. McConaughey is the pretty much the only non-tragedy here, since his character seems to be the only one that has layers, and he gives it the best he can. Kidman seems like she studied her character by watching episodes of Jerry Springer, and decided she could best play her character as an antithesis of her own persona, and plays it straight, while doing things and saying lines that literally make your jaw drop (just as she literally does in easily the most absurd scene of the film). Efron just has zero screen presence; even though the film is apparently about him, he seems like he's not even there. Oweloyo has the practiced air of superiority in his portrayal that made him such a convincing villain in RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, but here, it's just obnoxious. Gray, who also pulls duty as the narrator of the film, is actually decent, but it's a very cliched role (the sassy, wise, yet lovable maid), which is not her fault. The worst of the lot is sadly John Cusack, who has had his worst screen year ever, with this film and also THE RAVEN, another contender for the worst of 2012. He seems like he's trying to ape Nicolas Cage with the hair and the bad accent and the wild-eyed performance, but he fails on every conceivable level. They could have literally cast anyone they wanted, and it probably wouldn't have made a difference.

The worst part of this whole film is that there seems to be no theme; it's a mish-mash of different film conventions that mix together to make something so insulting to the viewer that it might just fool them into thinking this is great high-art cinema, calling to mind the axiom ""Well, if I don't understand it, it must be great"". It's not. THE PAPERBOY is certainly one of the worst possible ways to spend two hours (more like three, considering all the times you'll pause it to hear your brain screaming at you), and it takes the award for worst film of 2012.",1365552000,22,5235,4.864349775784754

This time he co-wrote the screenplay with the writer of the book of the same title and directed the film

It is one of worst written and directed film in my recent memory with a cast of good and experienced
actors who committed to the roles most likely by the reputation of Daniels' last film and did everything they could

The film is a pointless, repulsive and sensationalized attempt of a period southern noir.

There are way too many 1 star and 5 star reviews thrown around - those should be reserved for the absolute worst and absolute best things out there, IMO.  That being said, this film has nothing redeeming about it.  It's terrible in every way a film can be terrible.

I was able to rent this in HD for only $0.99 and now I see why.  Trust me when I say that it's not worth watching even for less than a dollar.  You'll still want your money back when it's over . . . if you can make it to the end.",1363824000,2,537,3.8807339449541285

Get this movie, you will be thinking about it days later.",1363737600,,346,4.421875
5303008,4,B009AMAKBI,"Lee Daniels may go down as the guy who makes films that make you uncomfortable. This may not be the reason people see films, but it's hard to deny that people like this exist. As in ""Precious"", few of the characters are likeable, or even smart, but I was taken in by the narrative being presented by a dedicated cast. Indeed, Nicole Kidman was over the top in portraying a delusional woman, wanting more than life has given her, with hopes and dreams of something better. It's the performance of an A-List actress daring to push the envelope and create unpleasantness in an effort to create a complete character. She is to be commended. The entire cast was going against their perceived personae, and they succeed.

What kept going thru my mind was that there ARE people like this, and it was a courageous effort for all involved to portray a side of life that many people simply choose to think doesn't exist. I don't go out of my way to see crazy people doing sensationalistic things; rather, was prompted to see it because of Kidman's lauded performance (SAG, etc.) Certainly, Kidman was fine, though she slipped into her native accent a few times. This was supposed to be a revolutionary performance from Zac Efron, but he really just played a delusional teen in love. McConnaughey played a gay character, and Cusack played mean and conniving. Indeed, everyone played against type (except, maybe Efron). Macy Gray always looks like she's stoned, but her sweet scenes with Efron were resonating. It took place in the late 60's, so maybe Macy was trying to copy the girls in ""The Help"". She just didn't have enough spunk.

I have no problem with the sleaziness, meanness, sexual innuendo, or basic stupidity of the characters. This is a film about survival, and it succeeds, considering the very different agendae of those involved.

Disgusting? Certainly. Realistic? Most of the time. A necessary film? Most definitely. Ugliness on our home front is prevalent as the ugliness of issues in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt or Darfur. We are the greatest nation on earth, but we have our blemishes, many more than are shown in this film.",1363651200,,2132,4.8038147138964575

The movie is an excellent and a fine rebuttal for the morass and chaos that progressives have led our culture into and reflects their phony, elitist roads to good intentions and where they eventually and inevitably lead.  Watch closely, think beyond, but, be careful - not the first - rather the concluding, sober realities this movie deals with might provoke unexpected insight.

5303094,3,B009AMAKBI,"Steamy goings on in the deep south as journalist looks to save convict from death row.
First the good news. The acting performances alone - particularly by Matthew McConaughey (who seems to finally have shaken off the talentless-hunk-who-every-loves-to-hates label), Nicole Kidman (who is superb as the promiscuous floozy), and John Cusack, who is surprisingly good as convict sleazebag - make the Paperboy watchable. Kudos too to Macy Grey, whose stage charisma translates well onto the silver screen. On a visceral level, director Lee Daniels serves up a steamy gumbo that lives up to its R rating. Sex? It's there. Violence? Present and correct. Sex and violence? You betcha. The Paperboy presses all these buttons with a gratuitousness befitting the 'pulp noir' genre. No problem there. But it's in the storytelling department that the Paperboy fails to deliver. The love story between Jack and Charlotte, for example, never really ignites. I suspect this is partly because of Zac Efron's shortcomings as a screen actor. He has the dreamy, photogenic good looks but not the acting chops to pull it off and certainly not the screen presence to create chemistry with Nicole Kidman. The main plotline (investigative journalism pursued in the face of institutionalised racism, etc.) sort of stutters along in fits and bursts but rarely grabs hold. I often found myself struggling to put together the nuts and bolts of the storyline. This is nothing new per se; I would struggle to put together the nuts and bolts of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but in the case of Paperboy, the continuity and plot coherence really is all over the place.
In very broad strokes, the Paperboy comes across like a kind of Wild Things with an extra helping of sleaze, but Wild Things is pound-for-pound a far better movie, despite the presence of Denise Richards, possibly the worst actress in celluloid history.",1363305600,,1884,5.061093247588424

It will shock you, disgust you, and even tempt you to stop watching. But hang in there. This is brilliant cinema if you like a wild ride (not as wild as David Lynch) with great acting. This is not a film I would show to everyone. It will have its small audience that will appreciate it as an ""art film"" that won't be a big seller or rental. Glad to see such big names take a risk with such a film (especially Kidman). This is Kidman's best work since her brilliant performance in To Die For. Just wished more films like this one would come around more often and not the same junk as the last movie you have seen. Risks don't happen enough when it comes to film making.

5303367,2,B009AMAKBI,"After viewing ""The Paperboy,"" Lee Daniels' feverish 2012 film, I wasn't sure what I had seen. All I knew was I did not want to see it again. To call this film trashy is doing it a favor. ""The Paperboy"" is not just repulsive, it's an especially virulent flu combining the worst of William Friedkin with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pink-Flamingos/dp/B0002RQ3M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pink Flamingos</a>. It is Southern Gothic grotesque with overlapping dialogue, illogical editing and indulgent forays. There's a tendency to overrate this film because it's so bad, as if Daniels was aggressively strolling through the kitsch realm of Todd Haynes' Barbie dolls.

Daniels captured lightning in a bottle with his 2009 work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious/dp/B0037QM8YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious</a>, a dark, sometimes equally disturbing tale about a black woman insisting upon respectability after years of abuse. It was some kind of brilliant work. Let's compare Daniels to Woody Allen or Spike Lee. Both men have crafted two of the greatest careers in film history, almost always detailing personal life experience. Equally important, they learned the craft and earned the ability for experimental excursions. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-At-St-Anna/dp/B004L1NEJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle At St. Anna</a>&nbsp;is not Lee's best film, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interiors/dp/0792846087/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interiors</a>&nbsp;is not Allen's most assured work, they are still fascinating products of great directors stretching their talents.

With respect, Daniels has not earned the right to force us to sit through such indulgence. ""The Paperboy"" is a pulpy, sweaty mess which should have more to offer. When Daniels, an African-American man, wades through areas of personal experience such as the character of Anita, the maid of the protagonists in this film and wonderfully played by Macy Gray, you can see his unique talent. Otherwise, it's as if Daniels was bored with the substandard material and tried to obsessively inject artistically campy strokes. He's lost in a swamp.

Based on a novel by Pete Dexter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paperboy/dp/0679421750/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paperboy</a>), the film takes place in small town Florida of 1969. College dropout Jack Jansen (Zac Efron, too old for this role), hangs at the family house wearing Fruit of the Loom briefs. His dad (Scott Glenn), adorned in a Civil War haircut, runs the local newspaper. Jack's big brother Ward (Matthew McConaughey) returns home as a reporter from the Miami daily with co-writer Yardley (David Oyelowo), a London-bred black man, in tow. They are going to expose the conviction of swamp thing Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack), lounging on death row for the murder of a local sheriff. It appears he was railroaded. He's got a sexy penpal in Charlotte (Nicole Kidman), a trailer park siren with clacking heels, who wants to marry him upon his release. Poor Jack, with doughy, first-love eyes, lusts after Charlotte.

Where the film goes is not particularly shocking, though multiple scenes are injected for shock value. Daniels gives us graphic demonstrations of public masturbation, animal mutilation, sadism, incest and murder. I am not making this up. Character development and dialogue have been shunted to the side while actors speak in a hazy whisper, eyes at half mast, as confused as if they just gulped a fistful of quaaludes. Scenes fade out at key moments, and loud breezes and sighs trample crucial dialogue.

One specific scene ranks as one of the most ridiculous of recent memory. A key character is hog-tied with chains on the floor of a motel room. He's been beaten senseless, lying on a sheet of plastic covered in blood. This ""stylish"" scene was not in the novel and entirely created by Daniels. So here's my frustration. You mean to tell me Daniels was given a considerable wad of money by a movie studio for the privilege of making a major film with some of the great actors of his generation, and the best he could come up with was S&M in a pink motel?

5303424,2,B009AMAKBI,"This movie is heavy with sweat and other bodily fluids, and its dense with drawl. Life in this Florida town in the 1960s is uniformly ugly, brutish, and short.

Theres very little positive emotion to leaven the proceedings. The producers of The Paperboy are obviously of the school of thought that maintains realism can only consist of meanness  that any beauty or nobility must necessarily be unrealistic pap. So we get the bad and the brutal heaped on top of more bad and brutal. The result is the opposite of what the producers intended. The result is an unrealistic, stereotyped portrayal of southern life.

Theres a lot of star power here. But the actors talents are wasted in this stew of eviscerated alligators, hanging possums, and battered humans. It skims the surface of all the clichs of southern crudity - like a stone cast into the ol fishing hole. Like that stone  youd do well to just skip it.",1360972800,3,908,4.6918238993710695

The movie is so focused on being over-the-top shocking and perverted it forgets to even have a plot.  What is the plot, if any?  Unless you've read the book or the wikipedia page, you'll be lost because of the plodding pace and the nonsensical editing. Why do we need to watch Nicole Kidman pee on someone...or pleasure herself in front of a prison cell...Or see Matthew McConnaughey postioned for a rape scene? Maybe one of these things, but not all of them, with more to boot.  Also, in addition to a poor script and editing, the acting is bad and often comes off campy and unbelievable in many scenes.  This in spite of a top-notch cast which includes Nicole Kidman and John Cusack. Nicole Kidman's accent is all over the place.  She is supposed to be Southern, but sometimes almost reverts to her native Australian accent, then back to Southern; other times flat as if she's Midwestern.  An unrelated note:  The movie obviously takes place in the 60's, but much of the music is 70's disco, which is an anachronism....which tells me that the makers of the movie can't edit OR research the history of different eras thoroughly enough.",1360627200,28,1234,4.6192660550458715

So many changes that were completely unnecessary and the characters were changed as well.  Although the movie has pretty good acting.  Suprisingly I enjoyed Zac Efron's acting the most.  First of all, the book had the correct language of that time period (the 60s).  The movie did not.  There was a bunch of sex thrown into the movie that was not in the book.  Yeardley was not a black man in the book.  There wasn't a lot of racist matter in the book; actually very little.  Yet, the movie had a lot of racist stuff in it.  Anita (the maid) is the one who narrates the movie.  Yet, her part in the book was very small.  Jack is the narrator of the book and should have been for the movie.  Jack and Charlotte DID NOT sleep together in the book.  There was no ring (the mom's ring) in the book.  Charlotte did not pee on Jack in the book - that was done by other girls at the beach.  Again, Yeardly was not a black man in the book, and therefore was not called the ""N"" word in the book.  Why was this in the movie?  The wedding of Jack/Ward's father was not in the book; the men at the bar were not black; Ward didn't perform a sex act on Yeardley in the book; no catering manager told Anita to put her black hair under her hat; Jack didn't go to rescue Charlotte from Van Wetter and the ENDING of the book is completely different from the movie.

Why watch it? That's what I was asking myself, and I'm sorry I did. I don't want some of those images in my memory. I wonder why actors who are so talented are drawn to these roles -- I can understand the challenge, playing against type, the opportunity to work with other great actors....But this movie gives nothing to the world except a story of violence and twistedness, and I just don't get it. The direction is okay, but he's too dark for me. I never saw Precious -- I could tell from the trailers it was story of pure misery and, sorry, I can read or watch the news for that.

Once it settled down in the over lapping talk department it was a very entertaining movie with lot's of strange and interesting characters,Trust me when I say no subject matter were off limits and I'm surprised it only got an R rating.

Nicole Kidman was good as the Ditzy, prisoner obsessed,over sexed 'Charlotte Bless' and so were the rest of the characters. Matthew McConaughey was bold in his portrayal of 'Ward Jansen' The oldest son of the southern Jansen family.
Ward's Little brother'Jack Jansen' is played by the very grown up looking and handsome Zac Efron who falls in love with Charlotte even though he sees her do some very over the top unladylike things especially for 1969 as this is the time period the film is set.

The surprise for me was 'Macy Gray' as the Jansen's housekeeper Anita who narrates the film and also has a special bond with Jack. She was great and overlooked in the award nominations. John Cusack is barley recognizable as the sweaty greasy 'Hillary Van Wetter' whom Charlotte is in love with,there's a lot of swamp action and other uncomfortable situations that will have your jaw dropping.

5303670,4,B009AMAKBI,"This is an odd ball story which is more about the quirky characters and fitting names than the plot. The story is in part narrated by Anita Chester(Macy Gray), the maid who breaks ""The Help"" stereotype. A mean sheriff of a small southern town was killed. Swamp man Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) was convicted of the crime on sketchy evidence and poor representation. Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughey) is a former resident of the town and now works for the Miami Herald. He has returned to town, along with an African-American side kick Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to conduct an investigative story. His dad W.W, Jansen (Scott Glenn) owns the town's newspaper and is concerned that such an article might damage his paper.

Ward's young buck brother Jack (Zac Efron) comes along to help. The three of them are aided by Charlotte ""We all got our dark side"" Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is a rather nasty woman who is in love with Hillary Van Wetter through their correspondence, although up to now they have never met. Hillary is not very likeable, and would rather look up Charlotte's dress than contribute to his own defense to get off of death row. Jack is sweet on Charlotte who unmercifully teases him.

The film is quirky and the raw sexuality of Kidman draws you into the film. The film builds up for a big twist, but then ends rather abruptly, almost as if it was a true story. I found 3/4 of the film to be interesting. I think Nicolas Cage would have been better than Cusack for a swamp man. As a classy Aussie, you can't help but be in awe at Kidman's southern trash performance. This is a film clearly not for everyone. It is a soft grindhouse.

5303673,5,B009AMAKBI,"Spoiler alert: a couple of scenes as a warning of film content

Be forewarned: ""The Paperboy"" is not an easy film to watch. However, each actor turns in surprisingly riveting  performances as the flawed characters they portray, making the film both gruesome and rewarding.

It seems that Matthew McConaughey has something to prove after being named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine a few years ago. He apparently wants to burst his iconic pretty boy image which he surely does in this film. I declare, he has one of the most repulsive scenes in film history (my opinion) during and after a homosexual encounter. It's an image not soon forgotten and to his utmost credit that he would film it. His entire performance is riveting. (He also plays another image-buster in ""Killer Joe,"" another truly horrific movie.)

The most shocking acting is by John Cusack, a usually mild-mannered actor. Not here. No sirreee. I had to read the credits to learn the actor's name. John Cusack? No way, but, yes, he is outstanding as a brutal, sex-crazed sociopath. The object of his ""passion"" is Nicole Kidman, who, once again, shocks with the habitation of the role she plays. Kidman disappears into the role of this woman weary of broken relationships and seeking love from a prison inmate. He takes her to the swamp and all its symbolic meanings.

It is McConaughey's role as reporter to gather evidence to get Cusack's character freed. The problem is, well, you can guess it in a world gone seriously awry. This unwarranted freedom sets into motion some very irreversible and evil consequences. Themes abound.

Perhaps the most surprising performance of all is from Zac Efron. Little Zackie is now a man and a reputable actor in a very dark story of human nature at its worst and its best in struggling to find love in that doomed world.",1360195200,12,1830,4.812101910828026

5303770,4,B009AMAKBI,"This film (shot in New Orleans but set in a fictitious Northern Florida town called Lately) has everything you want from southern gothic c. 1969: a small ""Last Picture Show"" hotbox of a town (but in color) where everything glistens with guilt and shame and desire and where sin seems to be the only viable vocation/pastime; an omnipresent and everpresent indifference to justice regulated by a sadistic Welles-ian sheriff who thrives on squelching/thwarting things like young desire and hope and change; a psychotic swamp billy accused of killing the sheriff; a hothouse vamp infatuated/obsessed with every lurid/pulpy detail of the psychotic swamp billy's story; a young motherless college boy in love with the hothouse flower; and a black maid with a nurturing heart and a fondness for southern cooking and narrative. Its also got two Miami reporters (one white, one black), each with a flair for the melodramatic, one a Sidney Poiter wannabe on the prowl for a sensationalistic potboiler that will hook him a Pulitzer, the other a Truman Capote wannabe on the prowl for some New Journalistic truth, but in all of this sweltering mess the former's a lot easier to come by than the latter. And thats the essentail focus of this film: what kinds of truths do we craft for ourslves, what kinds of truths do we settle for, and how much do we care (and what are the costs) if those truths are accurate or not.

The Paperboy oozes with racial and sexual tension and the desire for some cathartic sex or violence drips out of every one of its tortured pores but it casts no judgements nor promises any form of redemption for any one of its lonely band of dysfuntional hunters, so the film is not going to please anyone looking for your typical Hollywood characters and story. This is a different kind of tale and it makes its appeal in its own kind of way. I've heard others describe The Paperboy as ""campy"" but that is misleading because that implies that the film does not take its characters and subject matter seriously when in fact it does. And what it takes most seriously is the twisted forms that desire takes. Its blend of political and amorous and narrative idealism and corruption will remind viewers of everything from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to The Graduate.

With this many characters its impossible to tell just one story -- our interest is spread over several plot threads throughout -- but the main story (the one that unites them all, somewhat) is set in motion by Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is convinced that her jailhouse penpal Hillary Van Wetten (John Cusak) is innocent of the crime that he now sits on death row for committing. Its her letter that brings the Miami journalists Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughey) and Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to town. Jansen is an ex-resident of Lately, Fla. so when he arrives in town he sets up an ad hoc newspaper office in his dad's (also a newspaperman) garage. His younger brother, Jack Jansen (Zac Efron), has been kicked out of college and off of the swim team, so he is hired as their  driver. Jack's only companion in life is his maid, Anita (Macy Gray) and their peculiar friendship (she is a kind of a surrogate mother/confidante) is one of the most intriguing of the many intriguing narrative threads here. In fact its her voice that we hear telling this story (or at least the part of it that involves Jack's first love/coming-of-age). Viewers might be confused as to what they are supposed to pay attention to or whose story is most important or what kind of story/film this is (southern noir, coming-of-age story, love story) but thats what is so original about this film: everyone's story is equally important and intriguing and no one's story gets singled out--instead they all complement and comment on each other. The interesting thing about this approach to storytelling is that you feel like you are in completely new narrative terrain (a kind of hybrid terrain where William Faulkner meets Tennessee Williams and then they both run into Jim Thompson).

The newspaper team (Charlotte, Ward, Yardley, and Jack) divide their time between the garage that is chock-full of political artifacts from other long-dead or merely exausted political (as well as literary) eras, and the prison, where they interview the eerie and lascivious Hillary (who up until now Charlotte only knows through their written correpondence). Charlotte is convinced that Hillary is innocent even though he is as creepy as they come. She seems to see something in him and so the others try to see it too, but hes a hard one to read or define. But then, as the film progresses, it becomes quite clear that none of these characters are easy to read or define. Surprise follows surprise and each plot and character twist makes it harder and harder to be certain of anyone or anything. And that is the thrill of this film. Negative reviews make the film sound like it was sloppily made, but the confusion and doubt cast in the viewer's mind as to who is who and what really happened is intentional and purposeful, and the director doesn't want to clean the mess up for you, or simplify or sugar coat any of it. He wants to leave it messy and complicated. And thats what the film is: messy, complicated, innocent, corrupt, sick, touching (and all by design).

5303959,3,B009AMAKBI,"When `The Paperboy' showed at Cannes last year there was a lot of hoopla about how bad it was.  I mean, it was trashed for being trashy and basically considered one of the worst films in recent memory.  A lot of hype was brought to the table before it showed (Lee Daniels followup to his Oscar vehicle `Precious') and even afterward (Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron) and basically what was considered total trash became one of those movies that everyone HAD TO SEE, even though they were pretty much guaranteed that they would hate it.

I didn't hate this.

I want to start by saying that this movie is really very bad.  Nothing about it works separately and yet together it all works in this `so bad I can't help but be entertained by it' kind of way.  The accent work is awful (Efron can't hold an accent and McConaughey doesn't even try), the basic storyline is a confused mess (I've never seen a film that tried so hard to shove so much into one narrative) and the direction is a shoddy mess.  Still, I can't say that I hated this because despite the fact that it shouldn't work, it kind of does.

The basic plot follows a young paperboy named Jack living in Florida during the 60's.  His brother Ward is a journalist for a newspaper trying to dig up evidence to prove the innocence of a man named Hillary Van Wetter, who is on death row for killing a sheriff.  While in prison, Hillary started writing back and forth with Charlotte Bless, a simple minded southern tramp who has a thing for criminals.  She's convinced he's innocent (for strange reasons) and she tries to help Ward prove that.  In the meantime, young Jack is falling in love with Charlotte.  She represents everything he's lost over the years and in her he finds some sort of solace.

`The Paperboy' becomes messy because it can never establish a clear focal point.  At the core of the film is supposedly this murder case, and yet there really seems to be no interest in it at all.  It becomes background fodder for the love triangle forming between Hillary, Charlotte and Jack and yet, even at that Hillary becomes this side point with no real depth and so it becomes the Jack and Charlotte show.  Still, there is no real character development between them and their relationship seems like a gimmick more than anything else; simply a springboard for bizarre behavior and scenes of awkwardly stylized thoughts.  Then you have Ward and his partner Yardley and the underdeveloped semblance of the Jensen parents (father and step mother) and their housekeeper Anita, who appears to have a real impact on Jack and yet feels like more of a symbol than an actual character.  Yardley is treated like a villain and never really given depth and Ward's decline is supposed to have some significance and yet it is entirely wrapped up in the murder case, which by about thirty minutes in we've already forgotten all about.  With all the themes here none of them come to completion and so it is basically about a lot of things and nothing all at the same time.

Lee Daniels once again proves to be the worst thing about his films (he misdirected `Precious' and really was in no way shape or form the reason for its success).

The acting here is spotty.  Matthew McConaughey plays himself once again and John Cusack really needs a shower.  I used to think he was a good actor, but he tries WAY TOO HARD here.  Zac Efron does nothing of merit outside of botch an accent.  Kidman, Gray and Oyelowo are best in show for varying reasons (and none is without detractors either).  Oyelowo has a very underdeveloped character and yet he tries to insert a backstory and manages to do that to a certain degree.  Gray is the heart of the story (she narrates) and she does keep it together for the most part.  She doesn't really have a character and yet she manages to be a life-force, so for that she should be singled out.  Kidman got the bulk of the attention (good and bad) for her fearless portrayal of a woman gone crazy.  Her sexualized meeting with Hillary was ridiculous and incredible at the same time.  She is polarizing because so much of what she does is SO EXTREME and yet in the context of this crazy film it almost works SO WELL.

At the end of the day, this film is really, truly bad.  It is bad because Lee Daniels has no idea how to tell a story.  He has so many ideas and `cool tricks' that he thinks he's saying more than he is or showing us more than he is and yet at the end of the day his films say so much less than they should because he lacks focus and his `style' sacrifices `substance' and winds up creating an empty feeling in the pit of his films.  Still, the gritty 80's style porno screen shots make this interesting and the wildly uneven trashiness make `The Paperboy' nothing less than entertaining.",1359676800,,4781,4.474048442906574

And, in the end, there is nothing very revelatory or redeeming.

5304171,3,B009AMAKBI,"The basic premise of this movie is that a woman, Nicole Kidman, who has fallen in love with a prisoner, John Cusack, has enlisted the aid of a couple of reporters to help her clear her sweetheart's name because he was wrongly convicted.  Then, she can get him out of prison so that they can get married.  This all takes place in Florida in the 1960's. Matthew McConaughey plays the reporter who returns to his backwater home town with his ""colleague"" an African American journalist.  Zack Efron plays the younger brother of the reporter.  The story takes all sorts of twists and turns to get anywhere and when things finally do start happening, I found myself just sort of sitting and scratching my head thinking, ""What is going on?""  I will say that Nicole Kidman does a superb acting job here.  She plays a trailer park trashy blonde bombshell sex pot and does it very convincingly.  John Cusack, who plays the ruthless convict, also surprised me.  The roles for both these actors was such a departure from the types of characters they usually play and  yet both made it seem effortless.  Macy Gray plays the part of the family's  maid and was a surprisingly good actress as well.  I think there were just too many stories going on here so there's never one clear direction so despite some outstanding acting, the film overall just doesn't hold together.  There was also, in my opinion, too much unnecessarily graphic sexuality including a masturbation scene from Nicole Kidman that could almost qualify as soft porn.  That was just another jarring note that didn't seem to fit into the fabric of the story for me.  I can't say I enthusiastically recommend it as a great movie but it is at least interesting for the most part.  It is almost worth the cost of the rental just to see the performance of Nicole Kidman.  She's kind of been off the radar for the past few years (or been wasting her time in things like Bewitched) and I had forgotten how mesmerizing an actress she can be.",1359244800,,1985,4.60968660968661

5304221,3,B009AMAKBI,"Lee Daniels' PRECIOUS catapulted the director into the Hollywood spotlight.  THE PAPERBOY is an equally disturbing, often brutal tale of racism, homosexuality and graphic loveless sex.  Set in 1969 Florida, the story focuses on the murder of the town sheriff and the allegedly innocent man facing the electric chair.  Add to the mix a young boy who falls for the somewhat slutty girlfriend of the supposed killer.
THE PAPERBOY is not a pleasant film to watch and kind of leaves you wondering what purpose the movie serves.
Nicole Kidman, nominated for a Golden Globe, dominates the film in a searing performance unlike anything she's done before.  I was surprised by teen heartthrob Zac Efron's mature performance.  Macy Gray is enjoyable as the film's most likeable character, the sensitive maid Anita.  Matthew McConnaughey had a busy 2012, and plays against type as Efron's gay brother working to prove John Cusack's innocence,.  Cusack is very effective, also in a non-characteristic role.  David (I can't spell his last name!!) does well as the smarmy and deceitful boyfriend of Matthew.

He is the very essence of mimbo here, but I've seen bimbos like Pam Anderson act better than this. He has almost no emotional range, just his faraway check-out-my-hunkiness gaze. It's made worse because Kidman is quite good as the aging cougar, McConaughey is decent as yet another scrumbag as in Killer Joe, and Cusack is just goofy, but at least in an entertainingly over the top way.

The script has many clunkers and unintentional hooters, plus some patently lame dialogue, and some utterly pointless scenes of gore and sleazy violent sex. Daniels tries to make this seem vaguely noirish, but it just comes off as bad grindhouse. And to top it all off, the plot, such as it is, meanders all over the place, with no real point to it all that I could grasp. Kidman and Cusack are worth watching, but the script and especially Efron are so helpless that this became painful after a while.

It looks good, though, and has some good features and making-ofs and interviews, but you have to laugh when actors talk about how incredible a script is when you've just watched them ham it up to the nth degree.",1358985600,4,1355,4.590909090909091
5304224,4,B009AMAKBI,"Peter Dexter is responsible for both the novel THE PAPERBOY and the screenplay: his previous credits include Paris Trout, Mulholland Falls, Rush and Michael. Also contributing to the screenplay is openly gay Director Lee Daniels, best known for his work on Precious and Monster's Ball.  Combine these two talents and out comes THE PAPERBOY, a story with so much on its agenda that it keeps the viewer head-scratching.

THE PAPERBOY is told through the narration of a housemaid Anita (Macy Gray) that sets a tone for the dark tale that follows. The setting is Florida in 1969 in a Podunk town where two brothers Ward Jansen (Matthew McCounaghey) and Jack Jansen (Zac Efron) work in the town's newspaper run by their father (Scott Glenn): Jack is an ex-champion swimmer whose fallen on bad times and Ward is a gay reporter who returns to the town with his boyfriend Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to help a trashy woman Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is habituated to distant love affairs with men in the penitentiary to release an innocent prisoner Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) from jail with whom she exchanges letters, after he was convicted of the killing of a sheriff, and now awaiting his execution. While the investigation goes on course, the young Jack is hopelessly in love by the much older Charlotte, and nothing is what is seems as things progress between both the panorama of skewed relationships and between the leads found about the night of the sheriff's murder and the alleged criminal alibi.

The film takes us through racial epithets, a sadomasochistic sexual encounter between Ward and some black hustlers, a lot of bizarre frank physical behavior and coarse sexual encounters, bigotry/racism, swamp derring-do including the evisceration of an alligator - all of which somehow fit well into the mood that Director Daniels wants to convey his story.  There are exceptional performances from Kidman, Efron (who is developing into a very fine young actor), McCounaghey (in a new type of role for the lady killer), Cusack (believably smarmy and psychotic), and Macy Gray. The supporting cast is also consistently fine.  These attributes keep the somewhat loosely pasted together story in line. It is a brutally realistic film and not for the feint of heart.

The Actor's all did a brilliant job. Thank you, Lee Daniels for giving Zac Efron a chance. His performance is beyond any part he has every played. I know people will disagree with me but I felt/feel Honestly that Zac Efron should have receive a Supporting Actor Nomination, along with Nicole Kidman. I loved the scenes between, Matthew McConaughey & Zac Efron. I could truly feel the love between them as brothers and always looked out for one another. I also loved the characte Macy Grey played. She was the Mother, Ward and Jack never really had. And she knew where her place was in the World at this time. John Cusack's performance was also amazing and scary as hell. I could also see why The Golden Globes gave Nicole Kidman a nomination. She was so great. Again, I've never seen her in a role like this.

Ward Jansen (McConaughey) is a reporter who comes back to his Florida hometown to investigate a case involving a death row inmate. When he starts to dig into the case things get more and more strange and he is left wondering who is telling the truth and why are some people hiding the truth. This is a hard movie to review. I really liked it but it is not for everyone. The acting is amazing and really carries the movie. It is filmed in the style of a 60's type movie and is very gritty and I like the style. The movie itself however is a little slow but keeps you interested the whole time and you really begin to feel for all the characters. Even Zac Efron does a great job in this. This is not a happy movie at all and by the time the end comes you wonder if everyone got what they deserved or if it was all too much. If you are looking for action movies this is not it. This is more of a character driven drama that I enjoyed that had great acting and deserves to be seen by more people then will see it. Overall, very good but depressing. I give it a B.",1358812800,6,1123,4.040358744394619
5304273,2,B009AMAKBI,"Just watched this hoping for a solid movie due to Mr. Daniel's(Precious) & Mr. Dexter's(author of the original book and other books - Paris Trout) involvement; and a great cast.  Disappointing!  The actors do their best to overcome the weak script(Dexter & Daniels), but it's a no-win situation.  Bad sound mixing insures that much dialogue is missed, which doesn't help one following the characterizations.  The writers decided that the film needed a couple of major black characters added(Macy Gray & David Oyelowo) and made the McConaughey character gay - and neither additions are handled with any subtlety(I'll leave it at that).  When director Almodovar bailed, did Mr. Daniels take over with the understanding of 'tackling the BIG issues'?  Who knows.  I'm a huge fan of foreign films, new and old, so I'm pretty adept at snaking my way thru a demanding film.  But this one is just poorly constructed; from the screenplay to the direction.  Besides watching the actors struggle to overcome the material, the photography and music are the only things I can recommend.  There are also several unsavory scenes, that are not really needed for advancing the story, which many folks are going to find offensive.  The director seems intent on making an artsy/statement film out of what is basically a thriller/who-dunit/Southern Gothic genre.  The author would be better served to insist on writing the screenplay without any interference, and to adhere to the major plot lines of his own material.  One might get a perverse kick from hooting at the preposterous plot, dialog, and scenes(if that's any benefit).  I was born in the South in 1952 and this rang about as true as The Sound of Music rang true for WWII.",1358553600,3,1714,4.98943661971831
5304274,5,B009AMAKBI,"This movie is full of moments.  Individually, as an ensemble, and as characters in this story each actor (here I include Zac Efron who has proven his worth with this performance) provides moments that are single, intertwined, and part of a whole pastry in this bubbling tale of Southern civility and savagery.  I couldn't take my eyes away for a second for fear I'd miss another nuance casually thrown out by an eyebrow raised or a smile playing across the lips or an eye dimming with despair or brightening with hope.  Lee Daniels (who gave us 'Precious') must have borrowed his grandmother's recipe for stirring up a stewpot full of hot trashy desires and alligator innards into an exercise in pot boiling that truly proves that given the right leavening the South can rise again and again.  The actors took a big chance making this movie and they wallow in their found freedom of expression within this recipe like hogs at the trough.  Nicole Kidman will astonish you and numb you to the accomplishments of Matthew, John and David but the real shocker is how well Efron plays off of Kidman.  He pulls his weight and hers with wonderful touches here and there.  Everyone knows about the jellyfish scene but it's just one ingredient in a delightfully tasteless serving of home cooking.  This is a great american film and someday will be acknowledged as such.  I just wish Flo coulda been there to tell them all to 'kiss her grits'...cause they would have with tongues in whatever cheeks were handy.",1358121600,8,1499,4.734615384615385
5304275,4,B009AMAKBI,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but I should have known to expect something extremely provacative with Lee Daniels as the director.  Yeahhh... it's sweaty, filled with sex, profane, abrupt and even gory at times - it's ALL THAT, but at the core of it there's a really good story-line (I think).  There's something very authentic about this film; I can't explain it other than that.  I think the entire cast did an amazing job in their roles.  I would venture to say neither of them have ever played these types of very RAW characters before; everyone was unrecognizable.  That said, I really liked this movie a lot, but I don't think I'll ever to see it again - at least not before a meal (lol).",1357516800,6,709,4.465116279069767

8538595,5,B009AMAKBI,"When I noted this movie was based on a Pete Dexter novel (Deadwood, Paris Trout), and that Dexter and  director Lee Daniels wrote the screenplay, I knew this was worth a watch.  I was surprised it did not win Golden Globe, Oscar, or Sundance awards.  It was nominated at Cannes, but not awarded.  It reminded me of both the remake of Cape Fear and Jaws, which both won Oscars.  Jaws made it impossible for me to ever swim in the ocean, and this movie may keep me from ever entering Florida:).  Like Jaws, personal corruption and ambition are more important to the newspaper industry (in Jaws the tourist industry) than the truth, or public safety.  Some really damaged characters are drawn to each other and destroy each other.  There are racial issues to complicate the plot.  It is very dark, but exceptional.  All of the actors are amazing.  John Cusack is very creepy as the man who, even if he didn't kill the sheriff, is right where he belongs, death row.  I highly recommend this movie, just not on a night you need cheering up.",1514505600,,1035,4.535135135135135
