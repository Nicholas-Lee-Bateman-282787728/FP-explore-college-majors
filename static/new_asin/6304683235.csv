7875769,5,6304683235,"The Spice Girls really are an amazing group of girls.  This tape not only has all of the videos from their first album release, but also has personal ""behing the scenes"" footage of the girls' lives as the Spice Girls :)  I recommend this for any Spice Girls fan of old, or even new!  Has you singing along for every video, and transitions from music video to real life footage seamlessly!",1363651200,,388,4.436619718309859
7875770,5,6304683235,"I was craving a little Spice in my life last summer so I came to Amazon searching for some Spice Girls DVDs or something to feed my addiction.  I'm sad to say that none of the VHS have been released on DVDs but I was so excited to find this tape.

Being from the United States, not many of their videos were played on regular rotation on MTV or VH1 so it was great to see the videos for MAMA and WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?  The latter of those two is not only one of my favorite songs by the Spice Girls, I believe it is their best video on this set.  The comediennes such as Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders dress up and cause a commotion for the Comic Relief video and they rehersals are shown and they are too funny.

They also show some home videos taken by the Spice Girls on what appears to be their first big trips around the globe with stops in Paris, NYC and Hong Kong.  The witty banter that they girls do as the video plays is entertaining but you can't really understand if they are actually talking about the footage being shown.

Finally, we get to the end of the tape and we see a live peformance of WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE on the Brit Awards.  The girls COMPLETELY blow up the venue with their flawless, high energy performance...I actually got up in my living room and started dancing.

A must buy for any Spice Girls fan that is tired of watching Spice World over and over.  WHEN ARE THEY GONNA START PUTTING SOME OF THESE FABULOUS LADIES ON DVD?!?",1150243200,3,1467,4.151943462897527
7875771,5,6304683235,"This is the first thing that I ever bought of the Spice Girls. I wanted to know more about them & their music before I got too invested. Well, this video tells you everything about the girls & more. It shows how hard they work & that they are all really down to earth girls who had a dream & made it come true. The girls comment on everything in the video, providing info on events and footage they hadn't even seen before. Follow the girls behind the scenes of the making of their video ""Say You'll Be There"", see them at the famous Oxford street lighting, a pillowfight, having some laughs, and tons more. This video also includes their first 5 full-length music videos for ""Wannabe"", ""Say You'll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Mama"", & ""Who Do You Think You Are"". Also, one of the biggest treats is at the end of this video when we get to see the girls perform their famous Brit awards performance in 1997 of ""Who Do You Think You Are"". A very good video if you want to know more about the fab 5 & their first year of success!",1054944000,12,1024,4.2030456852791875
7875772,5,6304683235,"This video is probably my favourite of the biographical ones I've seen.  The Spice Girls do a very cute narration from a big comfy couch where they watch videos of all the things they did on their way up and laugh at themselves and all the fun they've had while explaining each situation to the fans.  It really gives you a taste of what the girls are like, and believe me, it's very spicy!  Also, this video includes full-length music videos that are a must-have for any Spice Girls fan! Buy it!  Now!  What are you waiting for? Hehehe.",972518400,4,537,4.383838383838384
7875773,5,6304683235,"This video is full of SPICE!  This video is sort of a video documentary of the girls rise to fame.  It include interviews, rare footage, and makings of videos.  The music videos are Wannabe, Say You'll Be There, Two  Become One, Who Do You Think You Are, and Mama.  The highlight of this  video is the live performance of Who Do You Think You Are? at the Brit  Awards in 1997!",951436800,9,376,4.211267605633803
7875774,5,6304683235,"This is an excellent hour. I did not always like the spice girls, I fell in love with them when I read real life, real spice, their book; and found out they were real people. since then I have been really trying hard to get  to know them, which is real hard in the U.S.A. This hour of girl power  documents their early years, it includes full length vesions of  ""wannabe, mama, say you'll be there, 2 become 1, who do you think you  are"" also preformances in London,Tours in Hong Kong, New York,L.A. and  at the Brit awards.
