7950280,2,B00005QAPU,"A friend of mine happened across this movie a few years ago, and I had the good(?) fortune to watch it with him. Where he found it, I honestly have no idea, as this movie is not just a B movie, it's worse. In fact, I doubt there's even a letter in the alphabet far enough away from ""A"" to really describe how bad this movie is. This movie is SO bad that not even Netflix carries it. That's right - the people who brought you ""Shatter Dead"" and ""Adam West's Tales From Beyond"" on instant play won't even have anything to do with this pile of celluloid refuse.

The premise is the best part of this movie, and it's not even all that great. A werewolf is shot by a hunter, and his organs are harvested and sold on the black market. Then, the world's worst scientist loses his eyes for failing to follow two of the most basic lab safety instructions: 1. always wear goggles and 2. always have an idea of what's going to happen when you mix two unlabeled substances. In this instance, it turns out they explode. Cut to a shot of really unconvincing moaning and bleeding effects.

The eyes of the dead werewolf are transplanted into this scientist. I have no idea how this is supposed to happen since the guy is supposedly in a hospital, and supposedly there are people who get paid to ensure that the organs being transplanted weren't just harvested from some schmo on the street. I won't hold the movie to this, as we're soon treated to the best part of this film: the werewolf mask.

Its at this point we really see how awful the budget is. Up until this point we've seen extremely ramshackle production values -- to put it bluntly, I've seen high school students produce better quality audio and video than this. But the special effects really take the cake. Our ""werewolf"" is a cheap rubber mask with a hand inside to make it move, and every shot is an extreme close-up of the mask. I guess the director thought it was a really clever way to show how aggressive and threatening this werewolf is supposed to be. Or, they just needed a way to get the wall in the background out of the frame, though this is met with only limited success.

I give this movie two stars because of its sheer camp value. It doesn't even try. An even scarier thought is that maybe they did try and thought it was good. Regardless of what the director's intentions were, the movie is so horrible, the premise so flimsy, the budget so nonexistant, and the characters so flat and lifeless, that it becomes amazing. I found myself short of breath from how hard I laughed at some scenes. Maybe it's not how they intended it, but I'd say the ""bargain bin"" price on this stinker makes it a worthwhile addition to your collection.

Overall, this is a fine piece of cinematic cheese to inflict on your friends.",1270252800,2,2776,4.4035087719298245
7950281,2,B00005QAPU,"Eyes of the Werewolf is a grade Z horror film.  DOn't get me wrong, I love these type of movies.  I just wish the filmmakers would have spent a little more time in production.  It fair viewing but nothing spectacular.  One of the filmmakers would go on to make a very good werewolf film ""Werewolf in a Women's PRison.""",1233100800,2,318,4.338983050847458
7950282,1,B00005QAPU,"I am sorry I bought this movie and watched it and it totally sucked.  Didn't like it one bit.  This movie just did not do it for me and I am really into horror movies, if you don't have to buy it I wouldn't.",1190246400,3,207,3.6818181818181817
7950283,5,B00005QAPU,"Forget the whole ""werewolf movie"" thing, looking at stephanie beatons body makes me feel like i'm 14 again,,,,,,and i'm 38. Wow she's hot!!! Trust me, if you have an extra few dollars, she's worth it,mmmmm!",1170979200,3,206,4.914285714285715
7950284,2,B00005QAPU,"This is an amatuer production shot on videotape, but is slightly more interesting in that it was made in 3-D. Some VHS and DVD versions do contain this version, which requires LCD shutter glasses. The 3-D version is often bundled with similar films along with the glasses and driver box. I've seen worse DTV stuff....",1127692800,2,317,4.781818181818182
7950285,1,B00005QAPU,"Real horror fans of werewolves, do NOT waste your time with this piece of garbage. It is so terribly acted by the most motly bunch of wannabee actors! The monster is one of the worse I have ever seen. Check out Dog Soldiers if you want to see some good stuff. The ultimate worst movie is Blood of the Werewolf, a trilogy of sophomoric attempts to scare.",1112572800,5,353,4.2835820895522385
7950286,2,B00005QAPU,"EYES OF THE WEREWOLF is available on VHS in the original 3-D format, so why is the DVD flat only? The movie is pretty good for amateur stuff, but they cheated by using some flat 2-D insert closeups of the wolf make-up, which really stand out as 99% of the film is 3-D.",1072742400,2,268,4.0754716981132075
