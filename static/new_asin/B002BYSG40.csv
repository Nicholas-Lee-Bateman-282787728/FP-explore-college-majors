3901379,4,B002BYSG40,"Glad they are releasing vol 2 of Power Rangers RPM. This season is proving to be one of the best of all the 17 seasons so far, and especially after the last few seasons. RPM takes place in the future when the earth is ruled by machines and pollution has forced the last surviving humans to retreat into the last surviving city, the domed city of Corintth. This vol 2 DVD shows how each of the rangers lives become intertwined and wind up in Corinth.
An excellent addition for any power rangers fan or even a non fan. Everyone can enjoy vol 1 and 2 of Power Rangers RPM for it has a more mature feel to it.",1244764800,6,605,4.135593220338983

8362492,1,B002BYSG40,"No more Battlizers, crossover team ups , Mega Battles , new movies , American made ranger suits ( including the Dino RPM Rangers) , old school rangers back from retirement and real new seasons. Thats how much Disney really cares about the fans , by taking out as much of power rangers as possible until they decide to cancel and break our hearts even more . Season 18 wasn't even a real new season , just a terribly updated version of season 1. I hate disney with a passion because they took all that out. If Haim Saban was able to continue the show with wild force while moving it from fox to Disney, why couldn't disney have dune the same with power rangers samurai during the shows move to Nickalodeon? Death to Disney !!!",1303948800,,725,4.377777777777778

It is made for kids and at least I don't have to worry about my son learning bad language or anything.  Good vs evil, what could be wrong with that?",1261872000,,322,3.923076923076923

8362495,4,B002BYSG40,"Since 1993, ""Power Rangers"" has become a part of the lives of people who grew up with the series.  Known as a ""sentai"" series (sentai means task force, typically given to Japan's yearly shows featuring a superhero group)  from Japan that has become it's own in America and Europe.

Now in its 17th year, the series ""Power Rangers RPM"" continues the popular sentai-line based on the Japanese series ""Engine Sentai Go-onger"" and is shown on ABC Kids.  This time the series definitely has its change in production with the series now being produced in New Zealand and instead of a storyline of the rangers trying to protect a city, the storyline of humanity is a bit more dismal.

""Power Rangers RPM"" takes place three years after a computer virus known as Venjix took over every computer on Earth and an army of robot droids was created to destroy humanity.  The only chance for human survival is to live in a domed city known as Corinth which is protected by a force field.

Humans who have traveled long and far to get to Corinth find themselves being aided by a the Power Rangers who take on monsters who wait around the city to attack any incoming humans.  In order to let the humans in, the force field of Corinth has to be lowered and thus, the Power Rangers must be ready at all times to fight and protect the last safe haven for humanity.

The Power Rangers RPM consists of:

  * Scott Truman (Red Ranger) - A former pilot of the Air Force Eagle Squadron, he must learn to lead the team and also deal with the military's colonel, his father Mason Truman.
  * Flynn McAllistair (Blue Ranger) - The Scottish who always has dreamed of being a superhero.  Learned his knowledge of mechanics from his father.
  * Summer Landsdown (Yellow Ranger) - A former rich and spoiled heiress, she knows how to fight and become a team member.
  * Ziggy Grover (Green Ranger) - A former member of Fresno Bob's criminal organization, he is like a modern day Robin Hood.  With the exception that he is rather clumsy, can't really fight and is all talk.
  * Dillon (Black Ranger) - Not much is known about Dillon.  He has no recollection of his past at all.

Other Characters:

  * Dr. K - The young scientist (and the world's genius) who created the technology for Power Rangers RPM.  Lacks emotion (especially a sense of humor) and is always focused on her work.
  * Colonel Mason Truman - Father of Scott (Red Ranger) and overprotective of him, especially since his other son was killed during battle.
  * Tenaya 7 - A Generation-7 Gynoid  that is created by Venjix and resembles a human and in the earlier episodes, the main nemesis of the Power Rangers.  Despises humanity.

Included on ""Race for Corinth"" (volume 2) are episodes 6-10.  Here is a list of the episode plus spoiler-less summaries:

  * EPISODE 6 - Ranger Green - Ziggy's past of working with a criminal organization but how he used his position to help others.
  * EPISODE 7 - Ranger Red - The story of Scott and his brother and how tragedy help him become a leader.
  * EPISODE 8 - Ranger Yellow Part 1 - The history of Summer Lansdown and how she was before she became a Power Ranger.
  * EPISODE 9 - Ranger Yellow Part 2 - Summer's parents return and want her to get married in order to make their family rich once again.
  * EPISODE 10 - Ranger Blue - The history of Flynn McAllistair and how he has wanted to become a superhero.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Power Rangers RPM: Race for Corinth"" is presented in Full Screen (1:33:1).  For the most part, the picture quality is much better than what you would see on television.  As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital Stereo Sound.  I preferred listening to the series with my home theater receiver set on all channels featuring stereo sound.  But otherwise, the series is front channel driven.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included on the DVD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's been awhile since I watched a sentai show.  I figured that with my son now six-years-old and into these type of shows, having grown up watching sentai (starting with Ninja Sentai Kakuranger) and tokusatsu shows (Blue Swat), it was good to watch ""Power Rangers RPM"" and see how much things have changed since the shows aired in the US back in the 1990's.

I actually enjoy the storyline of ""Power Rangers RPM"" as there is no group of high school kids who all hang out with each other and protect the city while listening to a robot, nor do we have any goofy duo's for comedy relief.  The idea of having the Power Rangers protect humanity's safe haven in a post-apocalyptic setting is actually pretty cool.  Also, it was actually interesting to see a ranger (green)who can't fight and is part of the group.  Never saw that one coming but it definitely makes up for interesting episodes.

With that being said, of course, there is still some campiness with the show and of course, it's important to remember that these shows are targeted for children, so serious minded parents or people may want to throw any logic out the door.  And although the show is shot in New Zealand, they do their best of not speaking with any of their accent (with the exception of the blue ranger).

Overall, as a parent, I watched the episodes with my six-year-old son and the only thing I had to warn him is in one scene, two rangers try to defend a mother who is with her baby (that is inside a stroller) and of course, the Rangers pick up the stroller and use it as a weapon (while the baby is inside) against the enemies.  Of course, this series has always had the power rangers fighting their enemies, so concerned parents will want to watch the show with their children to make sure if its a series appropriate for their own children.

And of course, adult sentai fans, the series is quite enjoyable for you too!

So far, the second volume of ""Power Rangers RPM"" is a fun and intriguing series that I can see children enjoying.  Although the second volume features more on character development and some mecha action and some weapon usage, the series is during a time where everything is experimental and Dr. K and the Power Rangers are testing technology out.  So, hopefully down the line we will see the series start to employ some cool weapons and possibly more battles between their combined robot vs. a monster.

Overall, another enjoyable volume of ""Power Rangers RPM""!",1252972800,8,6361,4.5525154457193295
8362496,3,B002BYSG40,"Power Rangers RPM: Race for Corinth contains the next 5 episodes in the Power Rangers RPM series: Listed Below:

Episode 6: Ranger Green
Episode 7: Ranger Red
Episode 8: Ranger Yellow Part 1
Episode 9: Ranger Yellow Part 2
Episode 10: Ranger Blue

Race for Corinth virtually contains episodes in which we learn the background of all of the characters.  It is a decent offering of episodes that should cater to people who are fans of the respective Rangers.  I cant really criticize the fact that most of these episodes are full of character backstory for it is necessary for character development.

Following suite of the first RPM Volume DVD, this one contains previews of Disney Blu-Ray movies, holiday direct to video films, and disney classics.  There are no other special features in this edition.  It is a pretty basic offering as a DVD edition.  I would like to commend that the menu music is catchy, though it loops way too often.

Get this set if you missed RPM on tv or like this season of Power Rangers.  I would suggest getting Volume 1 for sure though.",1252627200,,1065,4.647058823529412
