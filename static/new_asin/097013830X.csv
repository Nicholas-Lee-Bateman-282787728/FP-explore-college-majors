173516,5,097013830X,"A genuine sleeper that I never thought would make it to DVD! The story takes place in pre-Civil War Louisiana. Armand Assante (""I The Jury"", ""The Mambo Kings"") delivers a one-of-kind performance as a charismatic Cajun healer/con man who is elected by fate into becoming the pivotal figure in a powderkeg situation involving racist persecution. The film unfolds like a classic myth, or a great lost American folktale. Director Glen Pitre (of Cajun ancestory himself) immerses you in a time and place of American history where few have tread. You could call this a realistic ""western"" (""southern""?) adventure in the tradition of ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"", ""Zandy's Bride"", ""The Hired Hand"" or ""Days Of Heaven"". Like the aforementioned films, ""Belizaire the Cajun"" eschews traditional ""action"" scenes for engaging character development. While there are the requisite gunfights, ""posse"" chases and public hanging scenes, it never rings a false note; it all plays very ""real"". There is actually quite a bit of humor, despite the serious themes, making this film a great all-around entertainment. Memorable gallows scene toward the end is a near-classic all by itself. The 2004 DVD release sports a ""less than pristeen"" full-screen transfer, but the original print was low-budget to begin with. The audio is decent and the list price more than fair. Well worth your time.",1102377600,21,1361,5.219178082191781
173517,5,097013830X,"In all of American history you will be hard-pressed to find a culture that is as colorful or as mysterious as that of the Cajun people. It would be an even more difficult task to find a film that captures that culture in such vivid detail.
With a brilliant mix of comedy, drama, mystery and romance, this movie deserves to take its place among the classics. Armand Assante gives a commanding performance in the title role, assuring that Belizaire will be remembered as a permanent and endearing character in American folklore.",1045440000,6,526,4.791208791208791
173518,5,097013830X,"Never in my life have I ever enjoyed a movie as much as this one and I am glad to finally have my own copy.  Armand Assante shines as Belizaire and never a sexier man can be found in this role.  There could be no other Belizaire.  Taught me a lot of history (since I have a Canadian background) and introduced me to some wonderful music in Beausoleil.  Wonderful unrequited love story told many times in other genres but never so beautifully as here.  I enjoy the film for its story, its actors and the beautiful photography and music.  I cannot stress strongly enough for those who haven't seen it to watch it.  It will head their top 10 list as it does mine.",987033600,48,660,4.274193548387097

173521,2,097013830X,"I love Belizaire the Cajun. I was living in Louisiana when it originally opened. But this copy was terrible. I was showing it to some of my students and we were doing fine. Then it started freezing. We could fast forward and rewind to get it to work for a while, but then it would freeze again. I was very sad that my students couldn't enjoy it the way that I had.",1462060800,2,364,4.069444444444445

173523,5,097013830X,"Ad good as it getsI bought ""Belizaire the Cajun"" when it came out  in VCR format years ago and watched that  VCR many times. It has been years since I have had access to a VCR, so it was a genuine pleasure to find it in DVD format. As this movie gives you a little synopsis of early Cajun life, it  also takes you through all of your emotions. It is serious, funny, heart warming and action packed. It is a ""MUST SEE""!",1458777600,2,418,4.0120481927710845

173532,5,097013830X,"This virtually unknown film is a GEM.  I lived in Louisiana at the time the movie was made, so the whole spectrum of Louisiana culture was new for me. Mardi Gras, Cajun food, trying to understand various local accents - it was wonderful.  I worked at a Federal government office, and we sometimes had to make ""field calls"" to peoples' homes.  While I didn't live in Cajun country per se, some of the people we had to call on in the swampier areas were genuine Cajuns.  Without exception, I found them to be warm, hospitable, delightful, but sometimes hard to communicate with, as my French is limited and so was their English, in some cases. (And Cajun French is an entirely different animal than you meet in the standard classroom.)

""Belizaire"" embraces and celebrates everything I love about the Cajun people.  Armand Assante should have gotten an Academy Award for his performance.  It was stellar.  And his love for the married ""Alida"" was warm and tender.

Even in this day and age, some Cajuns live very much as they did in Belizaire's day - limited access to electricity or running water. Even people in Louisiana (some of them, anyway) consider the Cajuns to be backward, a hindrance to development. Stepping into Cajun country is indeed, rather like visiting a third-world country.  But it is charming, and this film celebrates that.

My husband bought the rather expensive DVD because his old VHS machine ate my tape copy (which I bought while living in Louisiana,) and I'm so glad he did.  Seeing the story again and hearing the music made for a joyful evening.",1416700800,6,1573,4.742647058823529
173533,5,097013830X,"I am so happy, I finally found and now have my own copy after so many years of searching!  To those of you desiring your own copy at a reasonable price, do as I did and go to the source.

173536,4,097013830X,"Another purchase I made tracking performances by stars of the series Dark Shadows (Nancy Barrett in this case).  My family roots are in southern Louisiana, and I had seen this years ago, but at that time I watched for the historical aspects.  Rewatching  was done out of curiosity of Ms Barrett's part, which turned out to be minimal.  It is acted out in pretty authentic dialect, which may be hard for someone not accustomed to the region to follow, but it is a fairly accurate picture of the times.",1395014400,,500,4.584269662921348
173537,5,097013830X,"great movie just as awesome as it was when it ws released in the 80's.. Still watch it and love .. so true to the Cajun culture!!!

173538,3,097013830X,The movie did not prove to be as good as I recalled...but then maybe first time viewers will enjoy it.  It was fun to hear the Cajun medical remedies from organic materials.  Acting a bit rough around the edges.,1392940800,2,211,4.384615384615385

173542,5,097013830X,"Armand Assante is easy on the eyes which is a plus for this movie.  He comes across as a very intelligent smooth talker who knows a great deal about not only herbs but superstitious peoples minds.  Just when you think things can't get worse it seems he has no chance for any life, let alone saving another.  I wish so much that I could divulge the ending but can't as it is a remarkable tale with a very surprising finale'.",1339891200,7,423,4.2625

With all the shows on cable right now that pretend to celebrate Cajun and Louisiana culture, one would think that this film would be back in print. Robert Duvall, are you listening? Because you know as well as I do that this needs to be in print, and not just in VHS.",1331424000,,431,4.142857142857143
173544,5,097013830X,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is a simple story and a simple production, but the story is inspirational humorous and timeless. Has to be seen to be appreciated. A slow build but worth the investment!",1322265600,,212,4.461538461538462

173548,5,097013830X,"I first picked this up out of the bargain bin at the video store. I was mostly interested in the music. I had seen another movie with a Cajun story line called ""Southern Comfort"" and discovered I loved the music. So, I bought Belizaire b/c I wanted to have the music. And make no mistake, the music is great! But I was majorly surprised at how wonderful the movie is! I stand in agreement with the other reviewers - this is well worth owning. Its one you'll want to see repeatedly. I know I still enjoy it every time I watch it, and its been many times over the years.",1144627200,4,568,4.172727272727273
